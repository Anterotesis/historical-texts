<HEAD>A short and easy METHOD WITH THE DEISTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">I. IN Answer to yours of the Third In∣stant, I much condole with you your unhappy Circumstances, of being pla∣ced amongst such Company, where, as you say, you continually hear the Sacred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and the Histories therein contain∣ed, particularly of <HI>Moses,</HI> and of <HI>Christ,</HI> and all <HI>Revealed</HI> Religion, turned into Ridicule, by Men who set up for <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Reason.</HI> And they say, That there is no greater Ground to believe in <HI>Christ,</HI> than in <HI>Maho∣met;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="003675_0003_100244999BD6C138"/>That all these Pretences to <HI>Revelation</HI> are <HI>Cheats,</HI> and ever have been among <HI>Pa∣gans, Jews, Mahometans,</HI> and <HI>Christians;</HI> That they are all alike Impositions of <HI>Cun∣ning</HI> and <HI>Designing Men,</HI> upon the <HI>Creduli∣ty,</HI> at first, of <HI>simple</HI> and <HI>unthinking</HI> People, till, their Numbers encreasing, their Delusi∣ons grew <HI>popular,</HI> came at last to be estab∣lished by Laws; and then the Force of <HI>Edu∣cation,</HI> and <HI>Custom,</HI> gives a Byass to the Judg∣ments of after Ages, till such Deceits come really to be believ'd, being receiv'd upon <HI>Trust,</HI> from the Ages foregoing, without exami∣ning into the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Bottom</HI> of them. Which these our modern Men of <HI>Sense,</HI> (as they desire to be esteem'd) say, That they only do, that they only have their <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> freed from the slavish Authority of <HI>Pre∣cedents</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> in Matters of <HI>Truth,</HI> which, they say, ought only to be decided by <HI>Rea∣son;</HI> tho' by a rudent Compliance with <HI>Po∣pularity</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> they preserve themselves from <HI>Outrage,</HI> and legal <HI>Penalties;</HI> for none of their Complexion are addicted to <HI>Sufferings,</HI> or <HI>Martyrdom.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir, That which you desire from me, is, some short Topic of <HI>Reason,</HI> if such can be found, whereby, without running to <HI>Au∣thorities,</HI> and the intricate Mazes of <HI>Learn∣ning,</HI> which breed long Disputes, and which these Men of <HI>Reason</HI> deny by wholesale, tho'
<PB N="5" REF="003675_0004_100202B1B0033E98"/>they can give no <HI>Reason</HI> for it; only suppose that <HI>Authors</HI> have been Trump'd upon us, <HI>Interpolated,</HI> and <HI>Corrupted,</HI> so that no Stress can be laid upon them, tho' it cannot be shewn wherein they are so <HI>Corrupted;</HI> which, in Reason, ought to lie upon them to prove, who alledge it; otherwise it is not only a <HI>Precarious,</HI> but a <HI>Guilty Plea:</HI> And the more, that they refrain not to quote Books on their Side, for whose Authority there are no better, or not so good Grounds. How∣ever, you say, it makes your Disputes end∣less, and they go away with Noise and Cla∣mour, and a Boast, That there is nothing, at least nothing <HI>Certain,</HI> to be said on the <HI>Chris∣tian</HI> Side. Therefore you are desirous to find some <HI>one Topic of Reason,</HI> which should demon∣strate the Truth of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and at the same Time, distinguish it from the <HI>Impostures</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the old <HI>Pagan</HI> World: That our <HI>Deists</HI> may be brought to this <HI>Test,</HI> and be either obliged to renounce their <HI>Reason,</HI> and the common <HI>Reason</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> or to submit to the clear Proof, from <HI>Reason,</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, which must be such a <HI>Proof,</HI> as no <HI>Imposture</HI> can pretend to, otherwise it cannot prove the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion not to be an <HI>Imposture.</HI> And, whether such a Proof, one single Proof (to avoid Confusion) is not to be sound out, you desire to know from me.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003675_0005_1002449C01477420"/>
And you say, That you cannot imagine but there must be such a <HI>Proof,</HI> because every <HI>Truth</HI> is in itself <HI>Clear,</HI> and <HI>One;</HI> and there∣fore, that <HI>One</HI> Reason for it, if it be the true Reason, must be sufficient; and if <HI>sufficient,</HI> it is better than <HI>many;</HI> for Multiplicity con∣founds, especially to weak Judgments.</P>
<P>Sir, You have impos'd an hard Task up∣on me; I wish I could perform it: For tho' <HI>every Truth</HI> is <HI>One,</HI> yet our Sight is so feeble, that we cannot (always) come to it <HI>directly,</HI> but by many <HI>Inferences,</HI> and laying of Things together.</P>
<P>But I think, that in the Case before us, there is such a Proof as You require, and I will set it down as <HI>short</HI> and <HI>plain</HI> as I can.</P>
<P N="2">II. First then, I suppose, that the <HI>Truth of the Doctrine of</HI> CHRIST, will be suffici∣ently evinced, if the <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> which are recorded of him in the <HI>Gospels</HI> be <HI>true;</HI> for his <HI>Miracles,</HI> if <HI>true,</HI> do vouch the <HI>Truth</HI> of what he delivered.</P>
<P>The same is to be said as to <HI>Moses.</HI> If he brought the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> in that miraculous Manner, which is related in <HI>Exodus,</HI> and did such other won∣derful Things as are there told of him, it must necessarily follow, that he was sent from GOD: These being the strongest Proofs we can desire, and which every <HI>Deist</HI> will con∣fess
<PB N="7" REF="003675_0006_1002035245AFA488"/>he would acquiesce in, if he saw them with his Eyes. Therefore the Stress of this Cause will depend upon the Proof of these <HI>Matters of Fact.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And the Method I will take, is, <HI>First,</HI> To lay down such <HI>Rules,</HI> as to the <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> in General, that where they All meet, such <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> cannot be <HI>false.</HI> And then, <HI>Secondly,</HI> To shew that all these <HI>Rules</HI> do meet in the <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and of <HI>Christ;</HI> and that they do not meet in the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> of the <HI>Heathen Deities,</HI> or can possi∣bly meet in any <HI>Imposture</HI> whatsoever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Rules</HI> are these. 1st. <HI>That the</HI> Matters of Fact <HI>be such, as that Mens out∣ward Senses, their</HI> Eyes <HI>and</HI> Ears, <HI>may be Judges of it.</HI> 2. <HI>That it be done</HI> Publick∣ly, <HI>in the Face of the World.</HI> 3. <HI>That not only publick</HI> Monuments <HI>be kept up in Me∣mory of it, but some outward</HI> Actions <HI>to be performed.</HI> 4. <HI>That such</HI> Monuments <HI>and such</HI> Actions <HI>or</HI> Observances <HI>be</HI> instituted, <HI>and do</HI> commence <HI>from the</HI> Time that <HI>the</HI> Mat∣ter of Fact <HI>was done.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Two</HI> first <HI>Rules</HI> make it impossible for any such <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> to be imposed upon Men, at the Time when such <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> was said to be done, because every Man's <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Senses</HI> would contradict it. For Example: Suppose any Man should pre∣tend,
<PB N="8" REF="003675_0007_1002449F64665430"/>that Yesterday he divided the <HI>Thames,</HI> in Presence of all the People of <HI>London,</HI> and carried the whole City, <HI>Men, Women,</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> over to <HI>Southwark,</HI> on dry Land, the <HI>Waters</HI> standing like Walls on both Sides: I say, it is morally impossible that he could perswade the People of <HI>London,</HI> that this was true, when every <HI>Man, Woman,</HI> and <HI>Child,</HI> could contradict him, and say, That this was a notorious Falshood, for that they had not seen the <HI>Thames</HI> so divided, or had gone over on dry Land. Therefore I take it for grant∣ed, (and I suppose, with the Allowance of all the <HI>Deists</HI> in the World) that no such Imposition could be put upon Men, at the <HI>Time</HI> when such <HI>publick Matter of Fact</HI> was said to be done.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore it only remains, that such <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> might be invented some Time after, when the Men of that Generation, wherein the Thing was said to be done, are all past and gone; and the Credulity of af∣ter Ages might be imposed upon, to believe that Things were done in former Ages, which were not.</P>
<P>And for this, the <HI>Two</HI> last <HI>Rules</HI> secure us, as much as the <HI>Two</HI> first <HI>Rules,</HI> in the for∣mer Case; for whenever such a <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> came to be invented, if not only <HI>Mo∣numents</HI> were said to remain of it, but like∣wise that publick <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Observances</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="003675_0008_100203543A93F4D8"/>were constantly used ever since the <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> was said to be done, the Deceit must be detected, by no such <HI>Monuments</HI> appear∣ing, and by the Experience of every <HI>Man, Woman,</HI> and <HI>Child,</HI> who must know that no such <HI>Actions,</HI> or <HI>Observances,</HI> were ever us'd by them. For Example, Suppose I should now invent a Story of such a Thing done a Thousand Years ago, I might, perhaps, get some to believe it; but if I say, that not on∣ly such a Thing was done, but that from that Day to this, every Man, at the Age of <HI>Twelve</HI> Years, had a <HI>Joint</HI> of his <HI>Little Finger</HI> cut off; and that every Man in the Nation did want a <HI>Joint</HI> of such a <HI>Finger;</HI> and that this <HI>Institution</HI> was said to be Part of the <HI>Mat∣ter of Fact</HI> done so many Years ago, and vouch'd as a <HI>Proof</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of it, and as having descended, without Interrup∣tion, and been constantly practic'd, in Memo∣ry of such <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> all along, from the Time that such <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> was done: I say, it is impossible I should be believed in such a Case, because every one could con∣tradict me, as to the <HI>Mark</HI> of cutting off a <HI>Joint</HI> of the <HI>Finger;</HI> and that being Part of my original <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> must demon∣strate the whole to be false.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let us now come to the <HI>Second</HI> Point, to shew, that the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="003675_0009_100244A0ECEB0218"/>and of <HI>Christ,</HI> have all these <HI>Rules,</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> before mentioned; and that neither the <HI>Mat∣ters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or what is report∣ed of the <HI>Heathen Deities,</HI> have the like; and that no <HI>Impostor</HI> can have them all.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to <HI>Moses,</HI> I suppose it will be allow'd me, that he could not have perswaded 600000 Men, that he had brought them out of <HI>Ae∣gypt,</HI> thro' the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> fed them 40 Years without <HI>Bread,</HI> by miraculous <HI>Manna,</HI> and the other <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> recorded in his Books, if they had not been true. Because every Man's <HI>Senses</HI> that were then alive, must have cantradicted it. And therefore he must have impos'd upon all their <HI>Senses,</HI> if he could have made them believe it, when it was <HI>false,</HI> and no such Things done. So that here are the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Second</HI> of the above mentioned <HI>Four</HI> Marks.</P>
<P>For the same Reason, it was equally im∣possible for him to have made them receive his <HI>Five</HI> Books, as Truth, and not to have rejected them, as a manifest <HI>Imposture;</HI> which told of all these Things as done before their <HI>Eyes,</HI> if they had not been so done. See how positively he speaks to them, <HI>Deut.</HI> xi. 2. to Ver. 8. <HI>And know you this Day, for I speak not with your Children, which have not known, and which have not seen the Chastisement of the Lord your God, his Greatness, his mighty Hand, and his stretched out Arm, and his
<PB N="11" REF="003675_0010_1002036713CFAF90"/>Miracles, and his Acts, which he did in the midst of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>unto</HI> Pharaoh, <HI>the King of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>and unto all his Land, and what he did unto the Army of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>unto their Horses, and to their Chariots; how he made the Water of the</HI> Red Sea <HI>to overflow them as they pursued after you; and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this Day: And what he did unto you in the Wilderness, un∣til ye came into this Place; and what he did unto</HI> Dathan <HI>and</HI> Abiram, <HI>the Sons of</HI> Eliab, <HI>the Son of</HI> Reuben; <HI>how the Earth opened her Mouth, and swallowed them up, and their Housholds, and their Tents, and all the Sub∣stance that was in their Possession, in the midst of all</HI> Israel. <HI>But your Eyes have seen all the great Acts of the Lord, which he did,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From hence we must suppose it impossible that these Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> (if an Imposture) could have been invented, and put upon the People, who were then alive, when all these Things were said to be done.</P>
<P>The utmost therefore that even a <HI>Suppose</HI> can stretch to, is, that these Books were wrote in some Age after <HI>Moses,</HI> and put out in his Name.</P>
<P>And to this, I say, that if it was so, it was impossible that those <HI>Books</HI> should have been received as the <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> in that Age wherein they may have been suppos'd to have
<PB N="12" REF="003675_0011_100244A4212F1E00"/>been first invented. Why? Because they speak of themselves as delivered by <HI>Moses,</HI> and kept in the <HI>Ark</HI> from his Time. <HI>And it came to pass, when</HI> Moses <HI>had made an End of writing the Words of this Law in a Book, until they were finished, that</HI> Moses <HI>commanded the</HI> Levites <HI>who bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, take this Book of the Law, and put it in the Side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a Witness against thee,</HI> Deut. xxxi. 24, 25, 26. And there was a <HI>Copy</HI> of this <HI>Book</HI> to be left like∣wise with the <HI>King. And it shall be when he sitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he shall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests the</HI> Levites: <HI>And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the Days of his Life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep all the Words of this Law, and these Statutes, to do them,</HI> Deut. xvii. 18, 19.</P>
<P>Here you see, that this Book of the <HI>Law</HI> speaks of it self, not only as an <HI>History</HI> or <HI>Relation</HI> of what Things were then done; but as the <HI>standing</HI> and <HI>municipal Law</HI> and <HI>Sta∣tutes</HI> of the <HI>Nation</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> binding the <HI>King</HI> as well as the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in whatever Age after <HI>Moses</HI> you will suppose this <HI>Book</HI> to have been <HI>forged,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="003675_0012_1002446F457CE070"/>it was impossible it could be received as Truth, because it was not then to be found, either in the <HI>Ark,</HI> or with the <HI>King,</HI> or any where else: For when first invented, every Body must know, that they had never heard of it before.</P>
<P>And therefore they could less believe it to be the <HI>Book</HI> of their <HI>Statutes,</HI> and the standing <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Land,</HI> which they had all along received, and by which they had been <HI>Go∣verned.</HI></P>
<P>Could any Man, now at this Day, invent a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Statutes,</HI> or <HI>Acts of Parliament</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> and make it pass upon the Na∣tion, as the only <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Statutes</HI> that ever they had known? As impossible was it for the <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> (if they were invented in any Age after <HI>Moses</HI>) to have been received for what they declare themselves to be, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Statutes</HI> and <HI>Municipal Law</HI> of the Nation of the <HI>Jews:</HI> And to have perswaded the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they had <HI>Own'd</HI> and <HI>Acknow∣ledg'd</HI> these <HI>Books,</HI> all along from the Days of <HI>Moses,</HI> to that Day in which they were first invented; that is, that they had <HI>Own'd</HI> them before they had ever so much as <HI>Heard</HI> of them. Nay more, the whole Nation must, in an Instant, forget their former <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> if they could receive these <HI>Books</HI> as being their <HI>Former</HI> Laws. And they could not otherwise receive them, because they
<PB N="14" REF="003675_0013_100244A685401208"/>vouch'd themselves so to be. Let me ask the <HI>Deists</HI> but this One short Question: Was there ever a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Sham Laws,</HI> which were not the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Nation, Pam'd</HI> upon any <HI>People,</HI> since the World began? If not, With what Face can they say this of the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Jews?</HI> Why will they say that of them, which they confess impossible in any <HI>Nation,</HI> or among any <HI>People?</HI></P>
<P>But they must be yet more unreasonable: For the Books of <HI>Moses</HI> have a further De∣monstration of their Truth, than even other <HI>Law-Books</HI> have: For they not only contain the <HI>Laws,</HI> but give an <HI>Historical</HI> Account of their <HI>Institution,</HI> and the <HI>Practice</HI> of them from that Time: As of the <HI>Passover,</HI> in Me∣mory of the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>First-Born</HI> in <HI>Aegypt:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers viii. 17, 18.</NOTE> And that the same Day all the <HI>First-Born</HI> of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> both of <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Beast,</HI> were by a per∣petual <HI>Law,</HI> dedicated to <HI>God;</HI> and the <HI>Le∣vites</HI> taken <HI>for all the First-Born of the Children of</HI> Israel. That <HI>Aaron's Rod,</HI> which <HI>hudded,</HI> was kept in the <HI>Ark,</HI> in Memory of the <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and wonderful <HI>Destruction</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram;</HI> and for the Confirmation of the <HI>Priesthood</HI> to the <HI>Tribe of Levi.</HI> As likewise the <HI>Pot</HI> of <HI>Man∣na,</HI> in Memory of their having been fed with it 40 Years in the Wilderness. That the <HI>Bra∣zen Serpent</HI> was kept (which remained to
<PB N="15" REF="003675_0014_10024470D02A5228"/>the Days of <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> xviii. 4.) in Memory of that wonderful Deliverance, by only <HI>Looking</HI> upon it, from the <HI>Biting</HI> of the <HI>Fiery-Serpents.</HI> Num. xxi. 9. The Feast of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> in Memory of the dreadful <HI>Ap∣pearance</HI> of <HI>God</HI> upon Mount <HI>Horeb,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And besides these <HI>Remembrances</HI> of <HI>parti∣cular Actions</HI> and <HI>Occurrences,</HI> there were other solemn <HI>Institutions,</HI> in Memory of their Deliverance out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in the <HI>General,</HI> which included all the <HI>Particnlars.</HI> As of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> Deut. v. 15. Their <HI>daily Sacri∣fices, and yearly Expiation;</HI> their <HI>New-Moons,</HI> and several <HI>Feasts</HI> and <HI>Fasts:</HI> So that there were <HI>Yearly, Monthly, Weekly, Daily Remembrances,</HI> and <HI>Recognitions</HI> of these Things.</P>
<P>And, not only so, but the <HI>Books</HI> of the same <HI>Moses</HI> tell us, that a particular <HI>Tribe</HI> (of <HI>Levi</HI>) was <HI>Appointed</HI> and <HI>Consecrated</HI> by <HI>God,</HI> as his <HI>Priests;</HI> by whose Hands, and none other, the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> were to be offered, and these solemn <HI>Institutions</HI> to be celebrated. That it was <HI>Death</HI> for any other to approach the <HI>Altar:</HI> That their <HI>High-Priest</HI> wore a glorious <HI>Mitre,</HI> and magnifi∣cent <HI>Robes</HI> of <HI>God</HI>'s own Contrivance, with the miraculous <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> in his <HI>Breast-Plate,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers xxvii. 21.</NOTE> whence the <HI>divine Responses</HI> were given: That at his Word, the <HI>King</HI> and all the <HI>People</HI> were to
<PB N="16" REF="003675_0015_100244A80F6540F0"/>go out, and to come in. That these <HI>Levites</HI> were likewise the <HI>Chief-Judges,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xvii. 8, to 13. 1 Chr. xxiii. 4.</NOTE> even in all <HI>Civil</HI> Causes, and that it was <HI>Death</HI> to resist their Sen∣tence. Now whenever it can be supposed that these Books of <HI>Moses</HI> were for∣ged, in some Ages after <HI>Moses,</HI> it is impossi∣ble they could have been received as true, un∣less the <HI>Forgers</HI> could have made the whole Nation believe, that they had received these <HI>Books</HI> from their <HI>Fathers,</HI> had been instruct∣ed in them when they were <HI>Children,</HI> and had taught them to their <HI>Children;</HI> moreo∣ver, that they had all been circumcised, and did circumcise their <HI>Children,</HI> in pursuance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what was commanded in these <HI>Books;</HI> that E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey had observed the yearly <HI>Passover,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eekly <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>New-Moons,</HI> and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nese several <HI>Feasts, Fasts,</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> commanded in these <HI>Books:</HI> That they had never eaten any <HI>Swines</HI> Flesh, or other <HI>Meats</HI> prohibited in these <HI>Books:</HI> That they had a magnificent <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> with a visible <HI>Priest∣hood</HI> to <HI>Administer</HI> in it, which was confined to the <HI>Tribe of Levi;</HI> over whom was placed a glorious <HI>High-Priest,</HI> cloath'd with great and mighty <HI>Prerogatives;</HI> whose <HI>Death</HI> on∣ly could <HI>deliver</HI> those that were fled to the <HI>Cities of Refuge.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. xxxv. 25, 28.</NOTE> And that these <HI>Priests</HI> were their ordinary <HI>Judges,</HI> even in <HI>Civil</HI> Matters: I say, was it possible
<PB N="17" REF="003675_0016_1002447292A9D8E8"/>to have perswaded a whole <HI>Nation</HI> of Men, that they had <HI>Known</HI> and <HI>Practised</HI> all these Things, if they had not done it? Or, <HI>Second∣ly,</HI> To have received a <HI>Book</HI> for Truth, which said they had <HI>practised</HI> them, and appealed to that <HI>Practice?</HI> So that here are the <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>Fourth</HI> of the <HI>Marks</HI> above-mentioned.</P>
<P>But now let us descend to the utmost De∣gree of <HI>Supposition. viz.</HI> That these Things were <HI>Practised,</HI> before these <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> were <HI>Forged;</HI> and that these <HI>Books</HI> did only <HI>impose</HI> upon the <HI>Nation,</HI> in making them be∣lieve, That they had kept these <HI>Observances</HI> in Memory of such and such Things, as were inserted in those <HI>Books.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, let us proceed upon this <HI>Sup∣position,</HI> (however groundless) and now, will not the same <HI>Impossibilities</HI> occur, as in the <HI>former</HI> Case? For, <HI>First,</HI> This must suppose that the <HI>Jews</HI> kept all these <HI>Observances</HI> in <HI>Memory</HI> of <HI>Nothing,</HI> or without knowing any Thing of their <HI>Original,</HI> or the <HI>Reason</HI> why they kept them: Whereas these very <HI>Obser∣vances</HI> did express the <HI>Ground</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> of their being <HI>kept,</HI> as the <HI>Passover,</HI> in <HI>Memory</HI> of God's <HI>Passing over</HI> the <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Is∣raelites,</HI> in that Night wherein he slew all the <HI>First-born</HI> of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> and so of the rest.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Let us <HI>suppose,</HI> contrary both to <HI>Reason,</HI> and <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> That the <HI>Jews</HI> did not know any <HI>Reason</HI> at all why
<PB N="18" REF="003675_0017_100244A998F78E48"/>they <HI>kept</HI> these <HI>Observances;</HI> yet was it pos∣sible to put it upon them, That they had <HI>kept</HI> these <HI>Observances</HI> in <HI>Memory</HI> of what they had never heard of before that Day, whenso∣ever you will suppose that these <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> were first <HI>Forged?</HI> For Example, Suppose I should now forge some <HI>Romantick</HI> Story, of strange Things done 1000 Years ago, and in Confirmation of this, should endeavour to per∣swade the <HI>Christian</HI> World, That they had all along, from that Day to this, <HI>kept</HI> the <HI>First Day</HI> of the <HI>Week,</HI> in <HI>Memory</HI> of such an <HI>Hero,</HI> an <HI>Appollonius,</HI> a <HI>Barcosbas,</HI> or a <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and had all been <HI>Baptiz'd</HI> in his Name; and <HI>Swore</HI> by his Name, and upon that very <HI>Book,</HI> (which I had then <HI>forged,</HI> and which they never saw before,) in their publick <HI>Judicatures;</HI> that this <HI>Book</HI> was their <HI>Gospel,</HI> and <HI>Law,</HI> which they had ever since that Time, these 1000 Years past, <HI>universally</HI> receiv'd and own'd, and none other. I would ask any <HI>Deist,</HI> whether he thinks it <HI>possible,</HI> that such a <HI>Cheat</HI> could pass, or such a <HI>Le∣gend</HI> be receiv'd as the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christians;</HI> and that they could be made believe, that they never had had any other <HI>Gospel?</HI> The same Reason is, as to the <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and must be, as to every <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> which has all the Four <HI>Marks</HI> before mentioned: And these <HI>Marks</HI> secure any such <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> as much from being <HI>Invented</HI> and <HI>Impos'd</HI> in
<PB N="19" REF="003675_0018_10024474EDC17488"/>any after <HI>Ages,</HI> as at the Time when such <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> were said to be done.</P>
<P>Let me give one very samiliar Example more, in this Case. There is the <HI>Stonhenge</HI> on <HI>Salisbury Plain,</HI> every Body knows it; and yet none knows the Reason why those great <HI>Stones</HI> were set there, or by whom, or in Me∣mory of what.</P>
<P>Now, suppose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mould write a Book To∣morrow, and tell there, That these <HI>Stones</HI> were set up by <HI>Hercules, Polyphemus,</HI> or <HI>Ga∣ragantua,</HI> in Memory of such and such of their Actions. And for a further Confirma∣tion of this, should say, in this <HI>Book,</HI> That it was wrote at the <HI>Time</HI> when such Actions were done, and by the very <HI>Actors</HI> themselves, or <HI>Eye-Witnesses.</HI> And that this <HI>Book</HI> had been received as <HI>Truth,</HI> and quoted by <HI>Au∣thors</HI> of the greatest <HI>Reputation</HI> in all <HI>Ages</HI> since. Moreover, That this <HI>Book</HI> was well known in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>enjoyn'd</HI> by <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> to be taught our <HI>Children;</HI> and that we did teach it to our <HI>Children,</HI> and had been taught it our selves wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we were <HI>Chil∣dren.</HI> I ask any <HI>Deist,</HI> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther he thinks this could pass upon <HI>England?</HI> And whether, if I, or any other should insist upon it, we should not, instead of being believ'd, be sent to <HI>Bedlam?</HI></P>
<P>Now let us compare this with the <HI>Stonbenge,</HI> as I may call it, or <HI>Twelve</HI> great <HI>Stones,</HI> set
<PB N="20" REF="003675_0019_100244AC52F057C8"/>up at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> which is told in the Fourth <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Joshua.</HI> There it is said, <HI>Verse</HI> 6. That the Reason why they were set up, was, that when their <HI>Children,</HI> in after Ages, should ask the Meaning of it, it should be told them.</P>
<P>And the Thing in Memory of which they were set up, was such as could not possibly be impos'd upon that Nation, at that Time, when it was said to be done, it was as won∣derful and miraculous as their Passage thro' the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>And withal, free from a very poor Objec∣tion, which the <HI>Deists</HI> have advanc'd against that Miracle of the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> Thinking to salve it by a <HI>Spring-Tide,</HI> with the Concur∣rence of a <HI>strong Wind,</HI> happening at the same Time; which left the <HI>Sand</HI> so dry, as that the <HI>Israelites,</HI> being all <HI>Foot,</HI> might pass thro' the <HI>Owsey</HI> Places, and <HI>Holes,</HI> which it must be supposed the Sea left behind it: But that the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> being all <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Chariots,</HI> stuck in those <HI>Holes,</HI> and were en∣tangled, so as that they could not march so fast as the <HI>Israelites:</HI> And that this was all the Meaning o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its being said, That God took off their (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Aegyptians</HI>) Chariot Wheels, that they drove them heavily. So that they would make nothing <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> at least not <HI>Miraculous,</HI> in all this Action.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="003675_0020_10024477545B4DC0"/>
This is advanc'd in <HI>Le Clerk's Dissertations upon Genesis,</HI> lately printed in <HI>Holland,</HI> and that Part, with others of the like Tendency, en∣deavouring to resolve other <HI>Miracles,</HI> as that of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> &amp;c. into meer <HI>Na∣tural</HI> Causes, are put into <HI>English</HI> by the well known <HI>T. Brown,</HI> for the <HI>Edification</HI> of the <HI>Deists,</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But these Gentlemen have forgot, that the <HI>Israelites</HI> had great Herds of many Thousand <HI>Cattle</HI> with them; which would be apter to <HI>stray,</HI> and fall into those <HI>Holes,</HI> and <HI>Owsey</HI> Places, in the Sand, than <HI>Horses,</HI> with <HI>Ri∣ders,</HI> who might direct them.</P>
<P>But such <HI>precarious,</HI> and <HI>silly Supposes,</HI> are not worth the Answering. If there had been no more in this <HI>Passage</HI> thro' the <HI>Red Sea.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>an that of a <HI>Spring-Tide,</HI> &amp;c. it had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpossible for <HI>Moses</HI> to have made the <HI>Isra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tes</HI> believe that Relation given of it in <HI>Exodu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> with so many Particulars, which Themselves saw, to be true.</P>
<P>And all those <HI>Scriptures</HI> which magnify this Action, and appeal to it as a full De∣monstration of the miraculous Power of God, must be reputed as <HI>Romance</HI> or <HI>Legend.</HI></P>
<P>I say this for the Sake of some Christians, who think it no Prejudice to the Truth of the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> but rather an Advantage, as rendring it more easy to be believ'd, if they can solve whatever seems <HI>Miraculous</HI> in it,
<PB N="22" REF="003675_0021_100244AF875EE2F8"/>by the Power of <HI>second Causes;</HI> and so to make all, as they speak, <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Easy.</HI> Wherein, if they could prevail, the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>easy</HI> Result would be, not to believe one Word in all those <HI>Sacred Oracles.</HI> For if Things be not, as they are told in any <HI>Rela∣tion,</HI> that <HI>Relation</HI> must be <HI>false:</HI> And if <HI>false</HI> in <HI>Part,</HI> we cannot <HI>trust</HI> to it, either in <HI>Whole,</HI> or in <HI>Part.</HI></P>
<P>Here are to be excepted, <HI>Mis-Translations,</HI> and <HI>Errors,</HI> either in <HI>Copy,</HI> or in <HI>Press.</HI> But where there is no Room for supposing of these, as where all <HI>Copies</HI> do agree; there we must either <HI>receive</HI> All, or <HI>reject</HI> All. I mean in any Book that pretends to be written from the <HI>Mouth</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> For in other common <HI>Histories,</HI> we may <HI>believe</HI> Part, and <HI>reject</HI> Part, as we see Cause.</P>
<P>But to return. The <HI>Passage</HI> of the <HI>Isra∣elites</HI> over <HI>Jordan,</HI> in Memory of which, those <HI>Stones</HI> at <HI>Gilgal</HI> were set up, is free from all those little <HI>Carpings</HI> before mentioned, that are made as to the <HI>Passage</HI> thro' the <HI>Red Sea.</HI> For Notice was given to the <HI>Israelites</HI> the Day before, of this great <HI>Miracle</HI> to be done. <HI>Josh.</HI> iii. 5. It was done at Noon-day, before the whole <HI>Nation.</HI> And when the <HI>Waters</HI> of <HI>Jor∣dan</HI> were <HI>divided,</HI> it was not at any <HI>Low-Ebb,</HI> but at the Time when that River <HI>overflowed all his Banks,</HI> ver. 15. And it was done, not by <HI>Winds,</HI> or in Length of Time, which <HI>Winds</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="003675_0022_1002447A13824B10"/>must take to do it: But all on the sudden, as soon as the <HI>Feet of the Priests that bare the Ark were dipped in the Brim of the Water,</HI> Then <HI>the Waters which came down from above, stood and rose up upon an Heap, very far from the City</HI> Adam, <HI>that is beside</HI> Zaretan: <HI>And those that came down toward the Sea of the Plain, even the Salt Sea, fail∣ed, and were cut off: And the People passed over, right against</HI> Jericho. The <HI>Priests</HI> stood in the midst of <HI>Jordan,</HI> 'til all the <HI>Armies</HI> of <HI>Israel had passed</HI> over. <HI>And it came to pass, when the Priests that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, were come up, out of the Midst of</HI> Jordan, <HI>and the Soles of the Priests Feet were lift up upon the dry Land, that the Waters of</HI> Jordan <HI>returned into their Place, and flowed over all his Banks, as they did before. And the People came up out of</HI> Jordan, <HI>on the Tenth Day of the first Month, and encamped in</HI> Gilgal, <HI>on the East Border of</HI> Jericho. <HI>And those Twelve Stones which they took out of</HI> Jordan, <HI>did</HI> Joshua <HI>pitch in</HI> Gilgal. <HI>And he spake unto the Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>saying, When your Children shall ask their Fathers in Time to came, saying, what mean these Stones? Then shall ye let your Children know, saying,</HI> Israel <HI>came over this</HI> Jordan <HI>on dry Land. For the Lord your God dried up the Waters of</HI> Jordan <HI>from before you, until ye were passed over; as the Lord
<PB N="24" REF="003675_0023_100244B1116ED460"/>your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up, from before us, until we were gone over. That all the People of the Earth might know the Hand of the Lord, that it is Mighty: That ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.</HI> Chap. iv. from ver. 18.</P>
<P>If the Passage over the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> had been only taking Advantage of a <HI>Spring-Tide,</HI> or the like, How would this teach <HI>all the People of the Earth, that the Hand of the Lord was Mighty!</HI> How would a Thing no more remarkable, have been taken Notice of thro' all the World! How would it have taught <HI>Israel</HI> to <HI>fear the Lord,</HI> when they must know, that notwithstanding, of all these <HI>Big Words,</HI> there was so <HI>Little</HI> in it! How could they have <HI>believ'd,</HI> or <HI>received</HI> a <HI>Book,</HI> as <HI>Truth,</HI> which they knew, told the Matter so far otherwise from what it was!</P>
<P>But, as I said, This Passage over <HI>Jordan,</HI> which is here compar'd to that of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> is free from all those <HI>Cavils</HI> that are made, as to that of the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> and is a fur∣ther Attestation to it, being said to be done in the same Manner as was that of the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to form our Argument, Let Us sup∣pose, that there never was any such Thing as that <HI>Passage</HI> over <HI>Jordan:</HI> That these Stones at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> were set up upon some other Occa∣sion, in some after Age: And then, that
<PB N="25" REF="003675_0024_1002447B9E5A8200"/>some designing Man invented this Book of <HI>Joshua,</HI> and said, that it was wrote by <HI>Joshua</HI> at that Time; and gave this <HI>Stonage,</HI> at <HI>Gil∣gal,</HI> for a <HI>Testimony</HI> of the <HI>Truth</HI> of it. Would not every Body say to him, We know the <HI>Stonage,</HI> at <HI>Gilgal;</HI> but we never heard be∣fore of this Reason for it? Nor of this Book of <HI>Joshua?</HI> Where has it been all this while? And <HI>Where,</HI> and <HI>How</HI> came you, after so ma∣ny Ages, to find it? Besides, this Book tells Us, that this <HI>Passage</HI> over <HI>Jordan</HI> was or∣dain'd to be taught our <HI>Children,</HI> from Age to Age: And therefore, that they were always to be <HI>instructed</HI> in the Meaning of that <HI>Sto∣nage</HI> at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> as a <HI>Memorial</HI> of it. But we were never taught it when we were <HI>Children;</HI> nor did ever teach our <HI>Children</HI> any such Thing. And it is not likely, That could have been forgotten, while so remarkable a <HI>Stonage</HI> did continue; which was set up for that, and no other End.</P>
<P>And if, for the Reasons before given, no such <HI>Imposition</HI> could be put upon us, as to the <HI>Stonage</HI> in <HI>Salisbury-Plain;</HI> How much less could it be as to the <HI>Stonage</HI> at <HI>Gilgal?</HI></P>
<P>And if, where we know not the <HI>Reason</HI> of a bare naked <HI>Monument,</HI> such a <HI>Sham-Reason</HI> cannot be impos'd; how much more is it im∣possible to impose upon us, in <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Observances,</HI> which we <HI>celebrate</HI> in Memory of particular <HI>Passages?</HI> How impossible to
<PB N="26" REF="003675_0025_100244B29BA95450"/>make us <HI>forget</HI> those <HI>Passages</HI> which we dai∣ly <HI>Commemorate;</HI> and perswade us, that we had always <HI>kept</HI> such <HI>Institutions</HI> in Memory of what we never heard of before; that is, that we knew it, before we knew it.</P>
<P>And if we find it thus impossible for an <HI>Imposition</HI> to be put upon us, even in some Things, which have not all the <HI>Four Marks</HI> be∣fore-mentioned; how much more impossible is it, that any <HI>Deceit</HI> should be in that Thing, where all the <HI>Four Marks</HI> do meet?</P>
<P>This hath been shew'd in the <HI>First</HI> Place, as to the <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Therefore I come now <HI>(Secondly)</HI> to shew, that, as in the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> so likewise, all these Four <HI>Marks</HI> do meet in the <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> which are re∣corded in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> of our B. <HI>Saviour.</HI> And my Work herein will be the shorter, because all that is said before, of <HI>Moses,</HI> and his Books, is every Way as applicable to <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Gospel.</HI> His <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Miracles</HI> are there said to be done <HI>publickly,</HI> in the Face of the World, as he argued to his Accusers, <HI>I spake openly to the World, and in Secret have I said nothing,</HI> John xviii. 20. It is told, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 41. that Three Thousand at one Time; and <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 4. that Five Thousand at another Time, were converted, upon Conviction of what themselves had seen, what had been done publickly before their Eyes, wherein it
<PB N="27" REF="003675_0026_1002447D723A94E0"/>was impossible to have imposed upon them: Therefore here were the Two first of the <HI>Rules</HI> before mentioned.</P>
<P>Then for the Two Second: <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>the Lord's Supper</HI> were instituted as perpetu∣al Memorials of these Things; and they were not instituted in after-Ages, but at the very Time when these Things were said to be done; and have been observed without Interruption, in all Ages thro' the whole Christian World, down all the Way from that Time to this. And <HI>Christ</HI> himself did ordain <HI>Apostles,</HI> and other <HI>Ministers</HI> of his <HI>Gospel,</HI> to <HI>Preach,</HI> and <HI>Administer</HI> these <HI>Sacraments;</HI> and to <HI>Govern</HI> His <HI>Church;</HI> and that <HI>always,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. xxviii. 20.</NOTE> even unto the End of the World.</HI> Ac∣cordingly they have continued by regular <HI>Suc∣cession,</HI> to this Day: And, no Doubt, ever shall, while the Earth shall last. So that the Christian <HI>Clergy</HI> are as notorious a <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> as the <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Levi</HI> among the <HI>Jews:</HI> And the <HI>Gospel</HI> is as much a <HI>Law</HI> to the <HI>Christians,</HI> as the Book of <HI>Moses</HI> to the <HI>Jews.</HI> And it being Part of the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> related in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> that such an <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> were appointed by <HI>Christ,</HI> and to <HI>con∣tinue to the End of the World;</HI> consequent∣ly, if the <HI>Gospel</HI> was a <HI>Fiction,</HI> and invented (as it must be) in some Ages after <HI>Christ;</HI> then, at that Time, when it was first inven∣ted, there could be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Clergy,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="003675_0027_100244B56D6012D8"/>as deriv'd themselves from the Institution of <HI>Christ;</HI> which must give the <HI>Lye</HI> to the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> and demonstrate the whole to be <HI>False:</HI> And the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> being press'd to be true, no otherwise than as there was, at that Time (whenever the <HI>Deists</HI> will suppose the <HI>Gospel</HI> to be <HI>Forged</HI>) not only publick <HI>Sacraments</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Institution, but an Order of <HI>Clergy,</HI> likewise of his Ap∣pointment to <HI>Administer</HI> them: And it be∣ing impossible there could be any such Things before they were <HI>Invented,</HI> it is as impossible that they should be <HI>Received</HI> when invented. And therefore, by what was said above, it was as impossible to have impos'd upon Man∣kind in this Matter, by inventing of it in af∣ter-Ages, as at the Time when those Things were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d to be done.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or what is Fabled of the <HI>Deities,</HI> do all want some of the aforesaid <HI>Four</HI> Rules whereby the Certainty of <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> is demonstra∣ted. First, for <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he pretended to no <HI>Miracles,</HI> as he tells us in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> c. 6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and those which are commonly told of him pass among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> themselves but as <HI>Legendary</HI> Fables; and as such, are rejected by the <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Learned</HI> among them, as <HI>Legends</HI> of their <HI>Saints</HI> are in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> See Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> his <HI>Life of Ma∣homet,</HI> Page 34.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003675_0028_100244818EDA17F0"/>
But, in the next Place, those which are told of him, do all want the Two first <HI>Rules</HI> before-mentioned. For his pretended Con∣verse with the <HI>Moon,</HI> his <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa,</HI> or Night-Journey from <HI>Mecca</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and thence to <HI>Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. were not performed before any Body. We have only his own Word for them; and they are as groundless as the Delusions of <HI>Fox,</HI> or <HI>Muggleton,</HI> among our selves. The same is to be said (in the second Place of the <HI>Fables</HI> of the <HI>Heathen Gods,</HI>) of <HI>Mercury</HI>'s stealing Sheep, <HI>Jupi∣ter</HI>'s turning himself into a <HI>Bull,</HI> and the like; besides the <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Unworthiness</HI> of such <HI>sensless</HI> pretended <HI>Miracles.</HI> And moreover, the Wife among the <HI>Heathen</HI> did reckon no otherwise of these but as <HI>Fables,</HI> which had a <HI>Mythology,</HI> or <HI>Mystical</HI> Meaning in them; of which several of them have given us the <HI>Rationale,</HI> or <HI>Explication.</HI> And it is plain enough, that <HI>Ovid</HI> meant no other by all his <HI>Metamorphoses.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, the <HI>Heathen Deities</HI> had their <HI>Priests: Games,</HI> and other <HI>publick Institu∣tions</HI> in Memory of them. But all these want the Fourth <HI>Mark, viz.</HI> That such <HI>Priest-hood</HI> and <HI>Institutions</HI> should <HI>Commence</HI> from the Time that such Things as they com∣memorate, were said to be done; otherwise they cannot secure after-Ages from the <HI>Impos∣ture,</HI> by detecting it, at the Time when first
<PB N="30" REF="003675_0029_100244B8A5E7CBE0"/><HI>Invented,</HI> as hath been argu'd before. But the <HI>Bacchanalia,</HI> and other <HI>Heathen Feasts,</HI> were instituted many Ages after what was re∣ported of these Gods was said to be done, and therefore can be no <HI>Proof</HI> of them. And the <HI>Priests</HI> of <HI>Bacchus, Apollo,</HI> &amp;c. were not <HI>Or∣dain'd</HI> by these supposed <HI>Gods;</HI> but were ap∣pointed by others, in after-Ages, only in <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> to them: And therefore these <HI>Orders</HI> of <HI>Priests</HI> are no Evidence to the Truth of the <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> which are reported of their <HI>Gods.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Now to apply what has been said; You may challenge all the <HI>Deists</HI> in the World, to shew any Action that is <HI>Fabulous,</HI> which has all the Four <HI>Rules,</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> be∣fore-mentioned: No, it is impossible. And (to resume a little what is spoke to before) the Histories of <HI>Exodus,</HI> and the <HI>Gospel,</HI> could never have been receiv'd, if they had not been true; because the Institution of the Priesthood of <HI>Levi,</HI> and of <HI>Christ,</HI> of the <HI>Sab∣bath,</HI> the <HI>Passover,</HI> of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> of <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> &amp;c. are there related, as descending all the Way down from those Times, without Interruption. And it is full as impossible to perswade Men, that they had been <HI>Circumcis'd, Baptis</HI>'d, had <HI>Cir∣cumcis</HI>'d, or <HI>Baptis'd</HI> their <HI>Children,</HI> cele∣brated <HI>Passovers, Sabbaths, Sacraments,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="31" REF="003675_0030_1002448318605370"/>under the <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Administration</HI> of a certain <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Priests,</HI> if they had done none of these Things, as to make them be∣lieve, that they had gone thro' <HI>Seas</HI> upon <HI>Dry Land,</HI> seen the <HI>Dead</HI> raised, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And without believing of these, it was impossible, that either the <HI>Law,</HI> or the <HI>Gospel,</HI> could have been received.</P>
<P>And the Truth of the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Exodus</HI> and the <HI>Gospel,</HI> being no otherwise press'd upon Men, than as they have practis'd such <HI>publick Institutions;</HI> it is appealing to the <HI>Senses</HI> of Mankind for the <HI>Truth</HI> of them; and makes it impossible for any to have in∣vented such Stories in after-Ages, without a palpable Detection of the Cheat, when first invented; as impossible as to have impos'd upon the <HI>Senses</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> at the Time when such <HI>publick Matters of Fact</HI> were said to be done.</P>
<P N="5">V. I do not say, that every Thing which wants these Four <HI>Marks</HI> is <HI>false;</HI> but that nothing can be <HI>False</HI> which has them <HI>All.</HI></P>
<P>I have no Manner of Doubt, that there was such a Man as <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> that he fought at <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> was killed in the <HI>Senate House;</HI> and many other Matters of Fact of ancient Times, tho' we keep no publick Ob∣servances in Memory of them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003675_0031_100244BA2EA7AE08"/>
But this shews that the Matters of Fact of <HI>Moses,</HI> and of <HI>Christ,</HI> have come down to us better guarded than any other Matters of Fact, how true soever.</P>
<P>And yet our <HI>Deists,</HI> who would laugh any Man out of the World, as an irrational Brute, who should offer to deny <HI>Caesar</HI> or <HI>Alexan∣der, Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> their publick Works and Actions, do, at the same Time, value themselves as the only Men of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Sense,</HI> of <HI>Free, Generous,</HI> and <HI>Unbyass'd Judgments,</HI> for ridiculing the Histories of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> that are infinitely better attested, and guard∣ed with infallible Marks, which the others want.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Besides that, the Importance of the Subject would oblige all Men to inquire more narrowly into the one than the other: For, what Consequence is it to me, or to the World, whether there was such a Man as <HI>Cae∣sar,</HI> whether he beat or was beaten at <HI>Phar∣salia;</HI> whether <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> wrote such Books; and whether what is related in the <HI>Iliads</HI> or <HI>Aeneids</HI> be <HI>True,</HI> or <HI>False?</HI> It is not Two Pence up or down to any Man in the World: And therefore it is worth no Man's while to enquire into it, either to <HI>op∣pose</HI> or <HI>justify</HI> the <HI>Truth</HI> of these Relations.</P>
<P>But our very <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Bodies,</HI> both this <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI> are concern'd in the <HI>Truth</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="003675_0032_10024484DBF21938"/>of what is related in the Holy Scriptures; and therefore Men would be more inquisitive to search into the Truth of these, than of any other Matters of Fact; examine and sift them narrowly; and find out the <HI>Deceit,</HI> if any such could be found: For it <HI>concern'd</HI> them <HI>nearly,</HI> and was of the last Importance to them.</P>
<P>How unreasonable then is it to reject these <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> so <HI>sifted,</HI> so <HI>examin'd,</HI> and so <HI>attested,</HI> as no other <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> in the World ever were; and yet to think it the most highly <HI>Unreasonable,</HI> even to <HI>Mad∣ness,</HI> to deny other <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> which have not the Thousandth Part of their Evi∣dence; and are of no <HI>Consequence</HI> at all to Us, whether <HI>True</HI> or <HI>False!</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. There are several other <HI>Topicks,</HI> from whence the Truth of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion is evinced to all who will judge by <HI>Reason,</HI> and give themselves leave to <HI>Consider.</HI> As the <HI>Improbablity</HI> that Ten or Twelve <HI>poor illiterate Fishermen</HI> should form a Design of converting the whole World to believe their <HI>Delusions;</HI> and the <HI>Impossibility</HI> of their ef∣fecting it, without Force of <HI>Arms, Learning, Oratory,</HI> or any one visible Thing that could recommend them! And to impose a <HI>Doctrine</HI> quite opposite to the <HI>Lusts</HI> and <HI>Pleasures</HI> of Men, and all <HI>worldly Advantages,</HI> or <HI>Enjoyments!</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="003675_0033_100244BC156D1B80"/>And this in an Age of so great <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Sagacity</HI> as that wherein the <HI>Gospel</HI> was first preached! That these <HI>Apostles</HI> should not only undergo all the <HI>Scorn</HI> and <HI>Contempt,</HI> but the severest <HI>Persecutions,</HI> and most cruel <HI>Deaths</HI> that could be inflicted, in Attestation to what themselves knew to be a meer <HI>Deceit</HI> and <HI>Forgery</HI> of their own Contrving! Some have suffer'd for <HI>Errors,</HI> which they thought to be <HI>Truth;</HI> but never any for what themselves <HI>knew</HI> to be <HI>Lyes.</HI> And the <HI>Apostles</HI> must know what they taught to be <HI>Lyes,</HI> if it was so, because they spoke of those Things which Acts iv. 20 they said, they had both <HI>seen</HI> and 1 John 1.1 <HI>heard,</HI> had <HI>looked upon,</HI> and handled with their <HI>Hands,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Neither can it be said, that they, perhaps, might have proposed some temporal Advan∣tages to themselves, but miss'd of them, and met with <HI>Sufferings</HI> instead of them: For if it had been so, it is more than probable, that when they saw their Disappointment, they would have discover'd their <HI>Conspiracy;</HI> es∣pecially when they might not have only sav'd their <HI>Lives,</HI> but got great <HI>Rewards</HI> for doing of it. That not one of them should ever have been brought to do this!</P>
<P>But this is not all: For they tell us, that their Master bid them expect nothing but <HI>Sufferings</HI> in this World. This is the Tenure of all that <HI>Gospel</HI> which they taught. And
<PB N="35" REF="003675_0034_1002448698B7D5C8"/>they told the same to all whom they <HI>Converted.</HI> So that here was no Disappointment.</P>
<P>For all that were <HI>Converted</HI> by them, were <HI>Converted</HI> upon the certain Expectation of <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and bidden <HI>prepare</HI> for it. <HI>Christ</HI> commanded his <HI>Disciples</HI> to take up their <HI>Cross</HI> daily, and follow him; and told them, that in the World they should have <HI>Tribula∣tion:</HI> That whoever did not forsake <HI>Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Lands,</HI> and their very <HI>Lives,</HI> could not be his <HI>Disciples:</HI> That he who <HI>sought to save his Life</HI> in this World, should <HI>lose</HI> it in the next.</P>
<P>Now that this despised <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI> should prevail so <HI>Universally</HI> against the <HI>Allurements</HI> of <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> and all the <HI>Blandishments</HI> of this World; against the <HI>Rage,</HI> and <HI>Persecution</HI> of all the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> of the Earth, must shew its <HI>Original</HI> to be <HI>Divine,</HI> and its <HI>Protector Almighty.</HI> What is it else could <HI>Conquer</HI> without Arms, per∣swade without <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> overcome <HI>Enemies,</HI> disarm <HI>Tyrants,</HI> and subdue <HI>Empires,</HI> with∣out <HI>Opposition!</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. We may add to all this, the Testi∣monies of the most bitter <HI>Enemies</HI> and <HI>Per∣secutors</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> to the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> such as <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Tacitus;</HI> of which the First flourished about Forty Years
<PB N="36" REF="003675_0035_100244BE8CF36248"/>after the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the other about Seventy Years after: So that they were capa∣ble of examining into the <HI>Truth,</HI> and wanted not <HI>Prejudice</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> sufficient to have inclin'd them to deny the <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> it self of <HI>Christ:</HI> But their Confessing to it, as likewise <HI>Lucian, Celsus, Porphyry,</HI> and <HI>Ju∣lian</HI> the <HI>Apostate;</HI> the <HI>Mahometans</HI> since, and all other <HI>Enemies</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI> that have arisen in the World, is an undeniable Attes∣tation to the Truth of the <HI>Matter of Fact.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. But there is another Argument more strong and convincing than even this <HI>Matter of Fact.</HI> More than the Certainty of what I <HI>see</HI> with my <HI>Eyes.</HI> And which the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> called, a <HI>more sure Word,</HI> that is, <HI>Proof,</HI> than what he <HI>saw</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> upon the <HI>Holy Mount,</HI> when our <HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> was <HI>Transfigured</HI> before him, and Two other of the <HI>Apostles:</HI> For having repeated that Pas∣sage, as a Proof of that whereof they were <HI>Eye Witnesses,</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> the <HI>Voice</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> giving Attestation to our Lord <HI>Christ,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 16, 17, 18. He says, <HI>Ver.</HI> 19. <HI>We have also a more sure Word of Prophesy,</HI> for the Proof of this <HI>Jesus</HI> being the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that is the <HI>Prophecies</HI> which had gone before of <HI>Him,</HI> from the Beginning of the World; and <HI>All</HI> exactly <HI>fulfilled</HI> in <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P>Men may dispute an <HI>Imposition</HI> or <HI>Delusion</HI> upon our outward <HI>Senses:</HI> But how that can
<PB N="37" REF="003675_0036_100202AD28423E70"/>be <HI>False,</HI> which has been so <HI>long,</HI> even from the Beginning of the World, and so <HI>Often</HI> by all the <HI>Prophets,</HI> in several Ages foretold; how can this be an <HI>Imposition,</HI> or a <HI>Forgery?</HI></P>
<P>This is particularly <HI>insisted</HI> on, in the <HI>Me∣thod with the Jews.</HI> And even the <HI>Deists</HI> must confess, that the Book we call the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> was in being, in the Hands of the <HI>Jews,</HI> long before our <HI>Saviour</HI> came into the World. And if they will be at the Pains to compare the <HI>Prophesies</HI> that are there of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> with the Fulfilling of them, as to <HI>Time, Place,</HI> and all other Circumstances, in <HI>the Person, Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection,</HI> and <HI>Ascension</HI> of our Blessed <HI>Saviour,</HI> will find this Proof what our <HI>Apostle</HI> here calls it, <HI>a Light shining in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-Star arise in your Hearts.</HI> Which God grant. Here is no Possibility of <HI>Deceit</HI> or <HI>Imposture.</HI></P>
<P>Old <HI>Prophesies,</HI> (and all so agreeing) could not have been contriv'd to countenance a new <HI>Cheat;</HI> and nothing could be a <HI>Cheat,</HI> that could fulfil all these.</P>
<P>For this therefore, I refer the <HI>Deists</HI> to the <HI>Method with the Jews.</HI></P>
<P>I desire them likewise to look there <HI>Sect.</HI> XI. and consider the <HI>Prophecies</HI> given so long ago, of which they see the Fulfilling at this Day, with their own Eyes, of the State of the <HI>Jews,</HI> for many Ages <HI>past,</HI> and at <HI>pre∣sent;</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="003675_0037_100244C1C261AA38"/>without a <HI>King,</HI> or <HI>Priest,</HI> or <HI>Temple,</HI> or <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> scattered to the Four <HI>Winds, Sifted</HI> as with a <HI>Sieve,</HI> among all <HI>Nations,</HI> yet <HI>preserved;</HI> and always so to be, a district People from all others of the whole Earth, Whereas those mighty Monarchies which op∣pressed the <HI>Jews,</HI> and which commanded the <HI>World,</HI> in their Turns, and had the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prospect of Perpetuity, were to be extingished, as they have been, even that their Names should be blotted out from un∣der Heaven.</P>
<P>As likewise, That as remarkable of our <HI>Blessed Saviour,</HI> concerning the <HI>Preservation</HI> and <HI>Progress</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI> Church, when in her <HI>Swadling Cloaths,</HI> consisting only of a few poor <HI>Fishermen.</HI> Not by the <HI>Sword,</HI> as that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but under all the <HI>Persecu∣tion</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Hell;</HI> which yet should not <HI>prevail</HI> against Her.</P>
<P>But tho' I offer these, as not to be slighted by the <HI>Deists,</HI> to which they can shew no∣thing equal in all prophane History; and in which it is impossible any <HI>Cheat</HI> can lie; yet I put them not upon the same Foot as the <HI>Prophesies</HI> before mentioned, of the <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Coming</HI> of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> which have been since the World began.</P>
<P>And that General Expectation of the whole Earth, at the Time of his Coming, insisted upon in the <HI>Method</HI> with the <HI>Jews,</HI> Sect. V. is greatly to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003675_0038_1002448C2C241C20"/>
But, I say, the foregoing <HI>Prophesies</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> are so strong a <HI>Proof,</HI> as even <HI>Mira∣cles</HI> would not be sufficient to break their Authority.</P>
<P>I mean, if it were <HI>possible</HI> that a <HI>True Mi∣racle</HI> could be wrought, in <HI>Contradiction</HI> to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m: For that would be for <HI>God</HI> to <HI>con∣tradict</HI> Himself.</P>
<P>But no <HI>Sign,</HI> or <HI>Wonder,</HI> that could possi∣bly be solv'd, should shake this <HI>Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>It is this that keeps the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Obstinacy: Though they cannot deny the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> done by our <HI>Blessed Saviour,</HI> to be truly <HI>Miracles,</HI> if so done as said: Nor can they deny that they were so done, be∣cause they have all the <HI>Four Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> before mentioned. Yet they cannot yield! Why? Because they think the Gospel is in <HI>Contra∣diction</HI> to the <HI>Law.</HI> Which, if it were, the Consequence would be unavoidable, that <HI>Both</HI> could not be <HI>True.</HI> To solve this, is the Business of the <HI>Method</HI> with the <HI>Jews.</HI> But the <HI>Contradiction</HI> which they suppose, is in their Comments that they put upon the <HI>Law;</HI> especially, they expect a <HI>Literal</HI> Fulfilling of those <HI>Promises</HI> of the <HI>Restauration</HI> of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> and outward <HI>Glories</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> of which there is such frequent Mention in the Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> the <HI>Psalms,</HI> and all the <HI>Prophets.</HI> And many Christians do expect the same; and take those <HI>Texts</HI> as <HI>Literally</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="003675_0039_100244C34A40D8F0"/>as the <HI>Jews</HI> do. We do <HI>Believe</HI> and <HI>Pray</HI> for the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Jews.</HI> For this End they have been so miraculously preserv'd, according to the <HI>Prophesies</HI> so long before of it. And when that Time shall come, as they are the most <HI>Honourable</HI> and <HI>Ancient</HI> of all the Nations on the Earth, so will their <HI>Church</HI> return to be the Mother <HI>Christian</HI> Church, as she was at first; and <HI>Rome</HI> must surrender to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Then all Nations will flow thither: And even <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s Temple may be <HI>Literally</HI> Built <HI>There,</HI> in the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the whole Earth; which <HI>Jerusalem</HI> must be, when the <HI>Fulness</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall meet with the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Jews:</HI> For no <HI>Nation</HI> will then contend with the <HI>Jews,</HI> nor <HI>Church</HI> with <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for <HI>Supremacy.</HI> All <HI>Nations</HI> will be ambitious to draw their <HI>Original</HI> from the <HI>Jews,</HI> whose are the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and from whom, as concerning the Flesh, <HI>Christ</HI> came.</P>
<P>Then will be fulfill'd that outward <HI>Gran∣deur</HI> and <HI>Restauration</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which they expect, pursuant to the <HI>Prophesies.</HI></P>
<P>They pretend not that this is limited to any particular <HI>Time</HI> of the <HI>Reign</HI> of the <HI>Mes∣siah.</HI> They are sure it will not be at the Beginning; for they expect to go through great <HI>Conflicts</HI> and <HI>Tryals</HI> with their <HI>Messiah,</HI> (as the Christian Church has done) before
<PB N="41" REF="003675_0040_1002448E03140A48"/>his Final <HI>Conquest,</HI> and that they come to <HI>Reign</HI> with him. So that this is no Obstruc∣tion to their <HI>Embracing of Christianity.</HI> They see the same Things fulfilled in us, which they expect themselves; and we expect the same Things they do.</P>
<P>I tell this to the <HI>Deists,</HI> lest they may think that the <HI>Jews</HI> have some stronger Ar∣guments than they know of, That they are not perswaded by the <HI>Miracles</HI> of our <HI>Blessed Saviour,</HI> and by the fulfilling of all the <HI>Pro∣phesies</HI> in him, that were made concerning the <HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
<P>As I said before, I would not plead even <HI>Miracles</HI> against these.</P>
<P>And if this is sufficient to perswade a <HI>Jew,</HI> it is much more so to a <HI>Deist,</HI> who labours not under these <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, I would not seem to clash with that (in a sound Sense) reasonable <HI>Caution,</HI> us'd by <HI>Christian</HI> Writers, not to put the Issue of the <HI>Truth</HI> wholly upon <HI>Miracles,</HI> without this Addition, when not done in Contradic∣tion to the <HI>Revelations</HI> already given in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And they do it upon this Consideration, That tho' it is impossible to suppose, that <HI>God</HI> would work a real <HI>Miracle,</HI> in Contra∣diction to what he has already Reveal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; yet Men may be impos'd upon by <HI>False</HI> and <HI>Seeming Miracles,</HI> and <HI>Protended Revelati∣ons,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="003675_0041_100244C5ECF02E50"/>(as there are many Examples, especi∣ally in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI>) and so may be shaken in the <HI>Faith,</HI> if they keep not to the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> as their <HI>Rule.</HI></P>
<P>We are told, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 11.9. <HI>Of him whose Coming is after the Working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and Lying Wonders.</HI> And <HI>Rev.</HI> xiii. 14. xvi. 14. and xix. 20. of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and <HI>False Prophets</HI> working <HI>Mi∣racles.</HI> But the Word, in all these Places, is only SEMEIA, <HI>Signs,</HI> that is, as it is ren∣der'd, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxv. 24. which, tho' some∣times it may be used to signify <HI>Real Mira∣cles,</HI> yet not always, not in these Places: For tho' every <HI>Miracle</HI> be a <HI>Sign</HI> and a <HI>Wonder,</HI> yet every <HI>Sign,</HI> or <HI>Wonder,</HI> is not a <HI>Miracle.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. Here it may be proper to consider a common <HI>Topick</HI> of the <HI>Deists,</HI> who, when they are not able to stand out against the Evidence of <HI>Fact,</HI> that such and such <HI>Miracles</HI> have been done; then turn about, and <HI>deny</HI> such Things to be <HI>Miracles;</HI> at least, That we can never be <HI>Sure,</HI> whether any <HI>wonderful</HI> Thing that is shewn to us, be a <HI>True</HI> or a <HI>False Miracle.</HI></P>
<P>And the great Argument they go upon is this, That a <HI>Miracle</HI> being that which ex∣ceeds the <HI>Power of Nature,</HI> We cannot know what <HI>exceeds</HI> it, unless we knew the utmost <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>Power of Nature;</HI> and no
<PB N="43" REF="003675_0042_1002448FC7367F20"/>Man pretends to know that; therefore, that no Man can <HI>certainly</HI> know whether any <HI>E∣vent</HI> be <HI>miraculous.</HI> And consequently, he may be <HI>cheated</HI> in his Judgment betwixt <HI>True</HI> and <HI>False Miracles.</HI></P>
<P>To which I answer, That Men may be so <HI>Cheated.</HI> And there are many Examples of it.</P>
<P>But that tho' we may not always <HI>Know</HI> when we are <HI>Cheated,</HI> yet we can <HI>certainly</HI> tell, in many Cases, when we are <HI>not cheated.</HI></P>
<P>For tho' we do not know the utmost <HI>Ex∣tent</HI> of the <HI>Power of Nature,</HI> perhaps, in any <HI>One</HI> Thing; yet it does not follow, that we know not the <HI>Nature</HI> of any Thing, in some Measure; and that <HI>certainly</HI> too. For Ex∣ample, tho' I do not know the utmost <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>Power of Fire,</HI> yet I <HI>certainly</HI> know, That it is the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> to <HI>burn;</HI> and, that when proper <HI>Fewel</HI> is administred to it, it is contrary to the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> not to <HI>consume</HI> it. Therefore, if I see <HI>Three</HI> Men taken off the Street, in their common wear∣ing Apparel, and without any <HI>Preparation,</HI> cast into the Midst of a <HI>Burning Fiery Fur∣nace;</HI> and that the <HI>Flame</HI> was so <HI>fierce,</HI> that it <HI>burnt</HI> up those Men that drew them in; and yet that these who were thrown in, should walk up and down in the <HI>Bottom</HI> of the <HI>Fur∣nace,</HI> and I should see a <HI>Fourth</HI> Person with them of <HI>Glorious</HI> Appearance, like the Son of
<PB N="44" REF="003675_0043_100244C7CA86EA70"/><HI>God.</HI> And that these Men should come up again out of the <HI>Furnace,</HI> without any Harm, or so much as the <HI>Smell</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> upon them∣selves, or their <HI>Cloaths,</HI> I could not be de∣ceived, in thinking that there was a Stop put to the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Fire,</HI> as to these Men; and that it had its Effect upon the Men whom it <HI>Burned,</HI> at the same Time.</P>
<P>Again, tho' I cannot tell how <HI>Wonderful</HI> and <HI>Sudden</HI> an <HI>Increase</HI> of <HI>Corn</HI> might be pro∣duc'd by the Concurrence of many <HI>Causes,</HI> as a <HI>Warm Climate,</HI> the <HI>Fertility</HI> of the <HI>Soil,</HI> &amp;c. Yet this I can <HI>certainly</HI> know, That there is not that <HI>Natural</HI> Force in the <HI>Breath</HI> of two or three <HI>Words</HI> spoken, to <HI>multiply</HI> one small <HI>Loaf</HI> of <HI>Bread,</HI> so <HI>fast,</HI> in the <HI>Breaking</HI> of it, as <HI>Truly</HI> and <HI>Really,</HI> not only in <HI>Appear∣ance</HI> and <HI>Shew</HI> to the <HI>Eye,</HI> but to fill the <HI>Bellies</HI> of several Thousand hungry <HI>Persons;</HI> and that the <HI>Fragments</HI> should be much more than the <HI>Bread</HI> was at first.</P>
<P>So neither in a <HI>Word</HI> spoken, to raise the <HI>Dead,</HI> cure <HI>Diseases,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Therefore, tho' we know not the utmost <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI> yet we can certainly know what is <HI>Contrary</HI> to the <HI>Na∣ture</HI> of several such Things as we do know.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' we may be <HI>Cheated</HI> and impos'd upon in many <HI>Seeming Miracles,</HI> and <HI>Wonders;</HI> yet there are some Things, wherein we may be <HI>Certain.</HI></P>

<P>Yet they would put it out of his <HI>Power,</HI> to make any Revelation of his Will to Man∣kind: For if we cannot be <HI>certain</HI> of any <HI>Miracle,</HI> how should we know when <HI>God</HI> sent any Thing <HI>Extraordinary</HI> to us?</P>
<P>Nay, how should we know the <HI>Ordinary</HI> Power of <HI>Nature,</HI> if we knew not what <HI>ex∣ceeded</HI> it? If we know not what is <HI>Natural,</HI> how do we know there is such a Thing as <HI>Nature?</HI> That all is not <HI>Supernatural,</HI> all <HI>Miracles,</HI> and so <HI>disputable,</HI> till we come to downright <HI>Scepticism,</HI> and doubt the <HI>Certain∣ty</HI> of our <HI>outward Senses,</HI> whether we <HI>See, Hear,</HI> or <HI>Feel;</HI> or all be not a <HI>miraculous</HI> Illusion!</P>
<P>Which, because I know the <HI>Deists</HI> are not inclin'd to do, therefore I will return to pur∣sue my Argument upon the <HI>Conviction</HI> of our <HI>outward Senses;</HI> desiring only this, That they would allow the <HI>Senses</HI> of other Men to be as <HI>certain</HI> as their own. Which they cannot re∣fuse, since without this, they can have no <HI>Certainty</HI> of their own.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Therefore, from what has been said, the Cause is summ'd up shortly in this, That tho' we cannot <HI>See</HI> what was done before our Time, yet by the <HI>Marks</HI> which I have laid down concerning the <HI>Certainty</HI> of <HI>Matters of
<PB N="46" REF="003675_0045_100244CAFB0B3048"/>Fact,</HI> done before our Time, we may be as much assur'd of the <HI>Truth</HI> of them, as if we saw them with our Eyes; because, whatever <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> has all the Four <HI>Marks</HI> be∣fore mentioned, could never have been <HI>in∣vented</HI> and <HI>received,</HI> but upon the Conviction of the <HI>outward Senses</HI> of all those who did <HI>receive</HI> it, as before is demonstrated. And therefore this Topick which I have chosen, does stand upon the <HI>Conviction</HI> even of Mens <HI>outward Senses.</HI> And since you have con∣fin'd me to <HI>One</HI> Topick, I have not insisted upon the other, which I have only named.</P>
<P N="12">XII. And now it lies upon the <HI>Deists,</HI> if they would appear as Men of <HI>Reason,</HI> to shew some <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> of former Ages, which they allow to be <HI>True,</HI> that has greater <HI>Evi∣dence</HI> of its <HI>Truth,</HI> than the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and of <HI>Christ;</HI> otherwise they can∣not, with any Shew of <HI>Reason,</HI> reject the one, and yet admit of the other.</P>
<P>But I have given them greater Latitude than this; for I have shewn such <HI>Marks</HI> of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and of <HI>Christ,</HI> as no other <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of those Times, however <HI>True,</HI> have, but these only: And I put it upon them, to shew any <HI>Forgery</HI> that has <HI>All</HI> these <HI>Marks.</HI></P>
<P>This is a short <HI>Issue:</HI> Keep them close to this. This determines the <HI>Cause</HI> all at once.</P>

<P>Otherwise l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them submit to the Irrefra∣gab <HI>Certainty</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. But if, notwithstanding of all that is said, the <HI>Deists</HI> will still contend, That all this is but <HI>Priestcraft,</HI> the Invention of <HI>Priests,</HI> for their own Profit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then they will give us an <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Priests,</HI> far different from what they intend: For then, we must look upon these <HI>Priests,</HI> not only as the <HI>Cunningest</HI> and <HI>Wisest</HI> of Mankind, but we shall be tempted to adore them as <HI>Deities,</HI> who have such Power, as to impose, at their Pleasure, upon the Senses of Mankind, to make them be∣lieve, that they had practis'd such <HI>Publick Institutions,</HI> Enacted them by <HI>Laws,</HI> Taught them to their <HI>Children,</HI> &amp;c. when they had never done any of these Things, or ever so much as heard of them before: And then, upon the Credit of their Believing that they had done such Things as they never did, to make them further Believe, upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same Foundation, whatever they pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pose upon them, as to former Ages: I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch a <HI>Power</HI> as this, must exceed all that is <HI>Hu∣mane;</HI> and consequently, make us rank these <HI>Priests</HI> far above the Condition of <HI>Mortals.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Nay, this were to make them outdo all that has ever been related of the <HI>Infernal
<PB N="49" REF="003675_0048_100244FED2AAF610"/>Powers:</HI> For tho' their <HI>Legerdemain</HI> has ex∣tended to deceive some unwary Beholders; and their Power of working some <HI>seeming</HI> Miracles has been great, yet it never reach'd, nor ever was supposed to reach so far, as to deceive the Senses of all Mankind, in Mat∣ters of such <HI>Publick</HI> and <HI>Notorious</HI> Nature as those of which we now speak, to make them believe, that they had enacted <HI>Laws</HI> for such <HI>Publick Observances,</HI> continually prac∣tis'd them, taught them to their <HI>Children,</HI> and had been instructed in them themselves, from their <HI>Childhood,</HI> if they had never <HI>E∣nacted, Practis'd, Taught,</HI> or been <HI>Taught</HI> such Things.</P>
<P N="3">3. And as this exceeds all the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Devils,</HI> so is it more than ever <HI>God Almighty</HI> has done since the Foundation of the World. None of the <HI>Miracles</HI> that He has shewn, or <HI>Belief</HI> which He has requir'd to any Thing that He has <HI>Reveal'd,</HI> has ever contradicted the <HI>outward Senses</HI> of any one Man in the World, much less of all <HI>Man∣kind</HI> together. For <HI>Miracles</HI> being Appeals to our <HI>outward Senses,</HI> if they should over∣throw the <HI>Certainty</HI> of our <HI>outward Senses,</HI> must destroy, with it, all their own <HI>Certainty,</HI> as to us; since we have no other Way to judge of a Miracle exhibited to our <HI>Senses,</HI> than upon the Supposition of the <HI>Certainty</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="003675_0049_100244CF2BE74200"/>of our <HI>Senses,</HI> upon which we give Credit to a Miracle, that is shewn to our <HI>Senses.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This, by the Way, is a yet unanswer'd Argument against the <HI>Miracle</HI> of <HI>Transub∣stantiation,</HI> and shews the Weakness of the Desence which the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> offers for it, (from whom the <HI>Socinians</HI> have lick'd it up, and, of late, have Glory'd much in it amongst us) That the Doctrines of the <HI>Tri∣nity</HI> or <HI>Incarnation</HI> contain as great seeming Absurdities as that of <HI>Transubstantiation:</HI> For I would ask; Which of our <HI>Senses</HI> is it which the Doctrines of the <HI>Trinity</HI> or <HI>Incarnation</HI> do contradict? Is it our <HI>Seeing, Hearing, Feel∣ing, Taste,</HI> or <HI>Smell?</HI> Whereas <HI>Transubstan∣tiation</HI> does contradict all these. Therefore the <HI>Comparison</HI> is exceedingly <HI>short,</HI> and out of Purpose. But to Return.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion be a <HI>Cheat,</HI> and nothing else but the <HI>Invention</HI> of <HI>Priests;</HI> and carry'd on by their <HI>Craft,</HI> it makes their <HI>Pow∣er</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> greater than that of <HI>Men, An∣gels,</HI> or <HI>Devils;</HI> and more than God himself ever yet shew'd or express'd, to <HI>Deceive</HI> and <HI>Impose</HI> upon the <HI>Senses</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> in such <HI>Publick</HI> and <HI>Notorious Matters</HI> of <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. And this <HI>Miracle,</HI> which the <HI>Deists</HI> must run into to avoid these recorded of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> is much greater, and more astonishing than all the <HI>Scriptures</HI> tell of <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="003675_0050_100245012F64FAF8"/>
So that these Men, who laugh at all <HI>Mi∣racles,</HI> are now oblig'd to account for the greatest of all, how the <HI>Senses</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> could be impos'd upon in such <HI>publick Mat∣ters</HI> of <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P>And how then can they make the <HI>Priests</HI> the most <HI>contemptible</HI> of all <HI>Mankind,</HI> since they make <HI>Them</HI> the sole <HI>Authors</HI> of this the <HI>greatest</HI> of <HI>Miracles?</HI></P>
<P N="15">XV. And since the <HI>Deists,</HI> (these Men of <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI>) have so <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>mean</HI> an <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Priests</HI> of all <HI>Religions,</HI> why do they not recover the World out of the <HI>Pos∣session</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of such <HI>Blockheads?</HI> Why do they suffer <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>States</HI> to be led by <HI>Them?</HI> To establish their <HI>Deceits</HI> by <HI>Laws,</HI> and inflict <HI>Penalties</HI> upon the <HI>Oppo∣sers</HI> of them? Let the <HI>Deists</HI> try their Hands; they have been trying, and are now busy a∣bout it. And free Liberty they have. Yet they have not prevailed, nor ever did yet pre∣vail in any <HI>Civiliz'd</HI> or <HI>Generous</HI> Nation. And tho' they have some <HI>Inroads</HI> among the <HI>Hot∣tentots,</HI> and some other the most <HI>Brutal</HI> Part of <HI>Mankind,</HI> yet they are still exploded, and <HI>Priests</HI> have and do prevail against them, a∣mong not only the <HI>Greatest,</HI> but <HI>Rest</HI> Part of the World, and the most <HI>Glorious</HI> for <HI>Arts, Learning,</HI> and <HI>War.</HI></P>

XVI. For as the <HI>Devil</HI> does ape <HI>God,</HI> in His <HI>Institutions</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> His <HI>Feasts, Sa∣crifices,</HI> &amp;c. so likewise in his <HI>Priests,</HI> with∣out whom, no <HI>Religion,</HI> whether <HI>True</HI> or <HI>False,</HI> can stand. <HI>False</HI> Religion is but a Corruption of the <HI>True:</HI> The <HI>True</HI> was before it; tho' it be follow'd close upon the Heels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revelation</HI> made to <HI>Moses,</HI> is elder than any <HI>History</HI> extant in the Heathen World. The <HI>Heathens,</HI> in Imitation of him, pretend∣ed, likewise, to their <HI>Revelations:</HI> But I have given those <HI>Marks</HI> which distinguish them from the <HI>True:</HI> None of them have those <HI>Four</HI> Marks before-mentioned.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Deists</HI> think all <HI>Revelations</HI> to he equally <HI>Pretended,</HI> and a <HI>Cheat;</HI> and the <HI>Priests</HI> of all <HI>Religions</HI> to be the same <HI>Con∣trivers</HI> and <HI>Juglers;</HI> and therefore they pro∣claim War equally against all, and are equal∣ly engag'd to bear the Brunt of all.</P>
<P>And if the Contest be only betwixt the <HI>Deists</HI> and the <HI>Priests,</HI> which of them are the Men of the greatest <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Sense,</HI> let the <HI>Effects</HI> determine it; and let the <HI>Deists</HI> yield the <HI>Victory</HI> to their <HI>Conquerors,</HI> who by their own Confession, carry all the World before them.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. If the <HI>Deists</HI> say, That this is be∣cause all the World are <HI>Blockheads,</HI> as well as those <HI>Priests</HI> who govern them; that all
<PB N="53" REF="003675_0052_10024504AD039328"/>are <HI>Blockheads,</HI> except the <HI>Deists,</HI> who vote themselves only to be Men of <HI>Sense.</HI> This (besides the Modesty of it) will spoil their great and beloved <HI>Topick,</HI> in Behalf of what they call <HI>Natural</HI> Religion, against the <HI>Reveal</HI>'d, <HI>viz.</HI> appealing to the <HI>Common Rea∣son</HI> of <HI>Mankind:</HI> This they set up against <HI>Re∣velation;</HI> think this to be sufficient for all the Uses of Men, here or hereafter, (if there be any after State,) and therefore that there is no Use of <HI>Revelation:</HI> This <HI>Common Reason</HI> they advance as <HI>Infallible,</HI> at least, as the <HI>su∣rest</HI> Guide, yet now cry out upon it, when it turns against them; when this <HI>Common Rea∣son</HI> runs after <HI>Revelation,</HI> (as it always has done) then <HI>Common Reason</HI> is a <HI>Beast,</HI> and we must look for <HI>Reason,</HI> not from the <HI>Com∣mon Sentiments</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> but only among the <HI>Beaux,</HI> the <HI>Deists.</HI></P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Therefore, if the <HI>Deists</HI> would a∣void the <HI>Mortification,</HI> (which will be very uneasy to them,) to <HI>yield</HI> and <HI>submit</HI> to be <HI>Subdu'd</HI> and <HI>Hew'd</HI> down before the <HI>Priests,</HI> whom of all Mankind they <HI>Hate</HI> and <HI>Des∣pise;</HI> if they would avoid this, let them confess, as the Truth is, That <HI>Religion</HI> is no Invention of <HI>Priests,</HI> but of <HI>Divine</HI> Original: That <HI>Priests</HI> were Instituted by the same Au∣thor of <HI>Religion;</HI> and that their <HI>Order</HI> is a <HI>Perpetual</HI> and <HI>Living Monument</HI> of the <HI>Mat∣ters of Fact</HI> of their <HI>Religion,</HI> Instituted from
<PB N="54" REF="003675_0053_100244D3E7982390"/>the <HI>Time</HI> that such <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> were said to be done, as the <HI>Levites</HI> from <HI>Moses,</HI> the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and succeeding <HI>Clergy,</HI> from <HI>Christ,</HI> to this Day. That no <HI>Heathen Priests</HI> can say the same: They were not appointed by the <HI>Gods</HI> whom they served, but by others in after Ages: They cannot stand the <HI>Test</HI> of the <HI>Four Rules</HI> before mentioned, which the <HI>Christian Priests</HI> can do, and they <HI>only.</HI> Now the <HI>Christian Priesthood,</HI> as Instituted by <HI>Christ</HI> Himself, and continu'd by <HI>Succession</HI> to this Day, being as <HI>Impregnable</HI> and <HI>Flagrant</HI> a <HI>Testimony</HI> to the Truth of the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> as the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> or any other publick Institutions: Besides that, if the <HI>Priesthood</HI> were taken away, the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and other publick Institutions, which are ad∣ministred by their Hands, must fall with them: Therefore the <HI>Devil</HI> has been most busy, and bent his greatest Force, in all Ages, against the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> knowing, that if <HI>That</HI> goes down, <HI>All</HI> goes with it.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. With the <HI>Deists,</HI> in this Cause, are joined the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and other of our <HI>Dissen∣ters,</HI> who throw off the <HI>Succession</HI> of our <HI>Priesthood,</HI> (by which only it can be demon∣strated,) together with the <HI>Sacraments</HI> and <HI>publick Festivals.</HI> And if the <HI>Devil</HI> could have prevailed to have these dropt, the <HI>Chris∣tian Religion</HI> would lose the most <HI>Undeniable</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="003675_0054_100245064D7F6220"/>and <HI>Demonstrative</HI> Proof for the Truth of the <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> upon which the Truth of his <HI>Doctrine</HI> does depend. Therefore we may see the <HI>Artifice</HI> and <HI>Ma∣lice</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> in all these Attempts. And let those wretched <HI>Instruments,</HI> whom he <HI>Ig∣norantly,</HI> (and some by a misguided Zeal) has deluded thus to undermine <HI>Christianity,</HI> now at last look back, and see the <HI>Snare</HI> in which they have been taken: For if they had prevailed, or ever should, <HI>Christianity</HI> dies with them; at least, it will be render'd <HI>precarious,</HI> as a Thing of which no <HI>Certain</HI> Proof can be given. Therefore let those of them who have any Zeal for the Truth, bless God that they have not prevailed; and quick∣ly leave them; and let all others be aware of them.</P>
<P>And let us Consider and Honour the <HI>Priest∣hood, Sacraments,</HI> and other <HI>Publick Institu∣tions</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> not only as <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Helps</HI> to <HI>Devotion,</HI> but as the Great E∣vidences of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Such <HI>Evidences</HI> as no <HI>pretended Revelation</HI> ever had, or can have. Such as do plainly distinguish it from all foolish <HI>Legends</HI> and <HI>Impostures</HI> whatsoever.</P>
<P N="20">XX. And now, last of all, if one Word of Advice would not be lost, upon Men who think so unmeasurably of themselves as the
<PB N="56" REF="003675_0055_100244D59A96CB10"/><HI>Deists,</HI> you may represent to them, what a Condition they are in, who spend that <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Sense</HI> which God has given them, in Ri∣diculing the Greatest of his <HI>Blessings,</HI> His <HI>Revelations</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and by <HI>Christ,</HI> to Re∣deem those from <HI>Eternal Misery,</HI> who shall <HI>Believe</HI> in Him, and <HI>Obey</HI> His <HI>Laws:</HI> And that God, in His wonderful Mercy and Wis∣dom, has so guarded his <HI>Revelations,</HI> as that it is past the Power of <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Devils</HI> to <HI>Counterfeit:</HI> And that there is no <HI>Denying</HI> of them, unless we will be so absurd, as to deny not only the <HI>Reason,</HI> but the <HI>Certainty</HI> of the <HI>outward Senses,</HI> not only of <HI>One, Two,</HI> or <HI>Three,</HI> but of <HI>Mankind</HI> in General. That this Case is so very plain, that nothing but Want of Thought can hinder any to discover it. That they must yield it to be so plain, unless they can shew some <HI>Forgery,</HI> which has all the <HI>Four Marks</HI> before set down. But if they cannot do this, they must quit their Cause, and yield a happy <HI>Victory</HI> over them∣selves; or else sit down under all that <HI>Igno∣miny,</HI> with which they have loaded the <HI>Priests,</HI> of being not only the most <HI>Pernici∣ous,</HI> but (what will gall them more) the most <HI>Inconsiderate</HI> and <HI>Inconsiderable of Man∣kind.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, let them not think it an Un∣dervaluing of their <HI>Worthiness,</HI> that their whole Cause is comprised within so narrow a
<PB N="57" REF="003675_0056_100397D8C47985E8"/>Compass; and no more Time bestow'd upon it than it is worth.</P>
<P>But let them rather reflect, how far they have been all this Time from <HI>Christianity;</HI> whose <HI>Rudiments</HI> they are yet to learn! How far from the Way of <HI>Salvation!</HI> How far the Race of their Lives is run, before they have set one Step in the Road to Heaven! And therefore, how much Diligence they ought to use, to redeem that Time they have lost, lest they lose themselves for ever; and be convinc'd, by a dreadful Experience, when it is too late, That the <HI>Gospel</HI> is a Truth, and of the last Consequence.</P>

<P>And to deny <HI>Providence</HI> in the <HI>first Cause,</HI> is the denying of a God: Whence had we our <HI>Providence?</HI> For we find we have a <HI>Provi∣dence</HI> to <HI>forecast</HI> and <HI>contrive</HI> how to <HI>preserve</HI> and <HI>govern</HI> that which we make or acquire: Therefore there must be a <HI>Providence</HI> much more <HI>eminently</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> to preserve and go∣vern all the Works which He has made. He that made the <HI>Eye,</HI> does he not see? And He who put <HI>Providence</HI> into the Heart of Man, has He none Himself?</P>
<P>And the Glory of his Wisdom and Power seems greater to us, in the <HI>Acts</HI> of His <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> than even in those of <HI>Creation;</HI> es∣pecially in His <HI>Governing</HI> the <HI>Actions</HI> of <HI>Free-Agents,</HI> without taking from them the <HI>Free∣dom</HI> of their <HI>Will</HI> to <HI>do</HI> as they <HI>list,</HI> and turn∣ing their very <HI>Evil</HI> into <HI>Good,</HI> by the <HI>Al∣mightiness</HI> of His Wisdom. We see great Part of this every Day before our Eyes, in His turning the <HI>Counsels</HI> of the <HI>Wise</HI> into <HI>Foolishness,</HI> and trapping the <HI>Wicked</HI> in the Works of their own Hands. This strikes us more sensibly, and is nearer to us, than the making of a <HI>Tree,</HI> or a <HI>Star;</HI> and we feel that over-ruling <HI>Power</HI> in His <HI>Providence,</HI> which we <HI>contemplate</HI> in His <HI>Creation.</HI></P>

When the <HI>Sins</HI> of Men are increas'd to pro∣voke <HI>God</HI> to take <HI>Vengeance,</HI> He permits the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Fury</HI> to incline their <HI>Wills</HI> to <HI>War,</HI> and Destruction of each other, <HI>and Nation rises up against Nation;</HI> and when in His <HI>Mercy,</HI> He thinks the Punishment is suffici∣ent, He calms their <HI>Rage,</HI> like the <HI>Roaring</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> and there is <HI>Peace.</HI> And they are so <HI>Free Agents</HI> in all this, that they think it is all their own doing; and so really it is, tho' under the unseen <HI>Direction</HI> of a Supe∣rior Power.</P>
<P>But not only in the <HI>Publick</HI> Transactions of the World, His <HI>Providence</HI> is observable; there is no Man, who has taken Notice of his own Life, but must find it as to his very <HI>private</HI> Affairs, a <HI>Thought</HI> sometimes <HI>dart∣ing</HI> into his Mind, to rid him out of a Diffi∣culty, or shew him an <HI>Advantage,</HI> which he could not find in much <HI>Considering</HI> before. At other Times, a Man's Mind is so <HI>clouded,</HI> as if his Eyes were shut that he cannot see his Way: Again, several Events which he thought most <HI>Funest,</HI> and his utter <HI>Ruin,</HI> he finds afterwards to be for the <HI>best,</HI> and that he had been <HI>undone,</HI> if that had not happened which he <HI>fear'd.</HI> On the other Hand, many Things which he thought for his great <HI>Bene∣fit,</HI> he has found to be for his <HI>Hurt.</HI> This shews a <HI>Providence,</HI> which sees further than we can, and disposes all our <HI>Actions,</HI> tho'
<PB N="62" REF="003675_0061_100244DD25AE87B8"/>done in the full <HI>Freedom</HI> of our own <HI>Will,</HI> to what <HI>Events,</HI> either <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Bad</HI> for us, as He pleases.</P>

<HEAD>III. <HI>Revelation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But these <HI>Considerations,</HI> from the <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> tho' <HI>Admirable</HI> and <HI>Glori∣ous,</HI> are within the <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Reason,</HI> and are but <HI>Earthly Things,</HI> in Comparison of those <HI>Heavenly Things,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> has re∣veal'd to Man at <HI>sundry Times,</HI> and in <HI>divers Manners,</HI> and are <HI>recorded</HI> in the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures,</HI> and which otherwise it was impossible for Man to have known. <HI>For what Man is he that can know the Counsel of God? Or who can think what the Will of the Lord is?
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. iv. 13, 14 15, 16.</NOTE> For the Thoughts of mortal Men are miserable, and our Devices are but uncertain; for the corrup∣tible Body presseth down the Soul, and the earthly Tabernacle weigheth down the Mind, that museth upon many Things; and hardly do we guess aright at Things that are upon Earth, and with Labour do we find the Things that are before us: But the Things that are in Heaven, who hath searched out?</HI></P>
<P>This then must be purely the Subject of <HI>Revelation;</HI> but when the <HI>Deist</HI> is come thus far, he is enter'd into a wide Field; for all Religions, <HI>Jewish, Heathen, Christian,</HI> and
<PB N="63" REF="003675_0062_1002450D8E131A88"/><HI>Mahometan,</HI> pretend to <HI>Revelation</HI> for their <HI>Original.</HI></P>
<P>To clear this Point, was the Design of the <HI>Short Method with the</HI> Deists, which gave the first Opportunity to our Conversation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heathen</HI> and <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religions not only want those <HI>Marks</HI> (there set down) which <HI>Ascertain</HI> the Truth of <HI>Fact,</HI> but their <HI>Morals</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> are impure, and incon∣sistent with the <HI>Attributes</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> as the Indulgence of <HI>Fornication,</HI> and <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and their <HI>Humane Sa∣crifices,</HI> (most abhorrent to the God of <HI>Ho∣liness</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI>) and the filthy Obscenity of their very <HI>Sacra;</HI> besides the great Defect of their <HI>Morals,</HI> which knew no such Thing as <HI>Humility, Forgiveness of Injuries, Loving</HI> their <HI>Enemies,</HI> and returning <HI>Good for Evil.</HI> Some of their <HI>Philosophers</HI> spoke against <HI>Re∣venging</HI> of <HI>Injuries,</HI> as bringing greater <HI>Injury</HI> to ourselves, or not worth the While; but not upon the Account of <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> to our <HI>Brethren,</HI> and doing them <HI>Good,</HI> tho' they did <HI>Evil</HI> to us; and by the Word <HI>Hu∣militas,</HI> they meant only a <HI>Lowness</HI> and <HI>De∣jection</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> which is a <HI>Vice;</HI> but they had no Notion of it as a <HI>Vertue,</HI> in having a <HI>low</HI> Opinion of <HI>One's self,</HI> and in <HI>Honour</HI> pre∣fering others before us: This they thought a <HI>Vice,</HI> and <HI>Abjection</HI> of <HI>Spirits.</HI> You may see <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Self-Conceit</HI> run through all
<PB N="64" REF="003675_0063_100244DED741E738"/>their <HI>Philosophy,</HI> besides their Principle of increasing their <HI>Empire,</HI> by <HI>Conquering</HI> other <HI>Countries</HI> who did them no Harm, whom they called <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>Into this Class comes likewise the <HI>Sensual Paradise</HI> propos'd by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and his Prin∣ciple of propagating his <HI>Religion</HI> by the <HI>Sword.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion has all the <HI>Certainty</HI> of <HI>Fact,</HI> and its <HI>Morals</HI> are <HI>Good;</HI> but be∣cause of the <HI>Hardness</HI> of their <HI>Hearts,</HI> they came not up to the Primitive <HI>Purity,</HI> as in Case of <HI>Polygamy</HI> and <HI>Divorce,</HI> wherein our <HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> reduces them to the <HI>Original,</HI> That from the <HI>Beginning</HI> it was not so; and in several other Cases mentioned in his <HI>Ser∣mon</HI> upon the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the Perfection of <HI>Morals,</HI> and of the true <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> was reserv'd for the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> which has, in more abundant Manner, than even the <HI>Jewish,</HI> the infallible <HI>Marks</HI> of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Facts,</HI> in the <HI>Multitude</HI> and <HI>Notoriety</HI> of the <HI>Mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acles</HI> wrought by our <HI>Blessed Saviour,</HI> beyond those of <HI>Moses.</HI> Which fully answers the Objection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that <HI>Christ</HI> wrought his <HI>Miracles</HI> by <HI>Beelzebub:</HI> For then, as he said to them, <HI>By whom do your Children cast out Devils?</HI> Was it by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> that <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> wrought their <HI>Miracles?</HI></P>

Then from the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Heavenliness</HI> of his <HI>Doctrine,</HI> all levell'd to destroy the <HI>King∣dom of Satan,</HI> those wicked Principles, and idolatrous Worship which he had set up in the World; the other <HI>Answer</HI> of our <HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> concludes <HI>demonstratively,</HI> of a <HI>King∣dom divided against it self,</HI> That it <HI>Satan</HI> cast out <HI>Satan,</HI> to promote that <HI>Doctrine</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> taught, we must alter our Notion of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and suppose him to be <HI>Good,</HI> and his <HI>Kingdom</HI> must then be at an End; which we see not yet done; for <HI>Wickedness</HI> still <HI>Reigns</HI> in the <HI>World.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IV. Object. <HI>As to the Holy Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Against these Things <HI>Reason</HI> hath nothing to object; but then <HI>Prejudices</HI> are raised up against what is <HI>Reveal'd,</HI> as being of Things that are above our <HI>Reason,</HI> and out of its Reach; as chiefly the Doctrine of the <HI>Blessed Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>In answer to which, we may consider, that if such Things were not above our <HI>Reason,</HI> there needed no <HI>Revelation</HI> of them, but only a bare <HI>Proposal</HI> of them to our <HI>Reason,</HI> made by any Body, without any <HI>Authority,</HI> and their own <HI>Evidence</HI> would carry them through.</P>
<P>In the next Place, we must acknowledge, that there are many Things in the <HI>Divine</HI> Nature far out of the Reach of our <HI>Reason.</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="003675_0065_100244E08145CE40"/>That it must be so: For how can <HI>Finite</HI> com∣prehend <HI>Infinite?</HI> Who can think what <HI>Eter∣nity</HI> is? A <HI>Duration</HI> without <HI>Beginning,</HI> or <HI>Succession</HI> of <HI>Parts</HI> or <HI>Time!</HI> Who can so much as <HI>imagine,</HI> or frame any <HI>Idea</HI> of a <HI>Be∣ing,</HI> neither made by it self, nor by any other? Of <HI>Omnipresence?</HI> Of a boundless <HI>Immensi∣ty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet all this <HI>Reason</HI> obliges us to allow, as the necessary Consequences of a <HI>First Cause.</HI></P>
<P>And where any Thing is establish'd upon the Full Proof of <HI>Reason,</HI> there Ten Thou∣sand <HI>Objections,</HI> or <HI>Difficulties,</HI> tho' we can∣not <HI>Answer</HI> them, are of no Force at all to overthrow it. Nothing can do that, but to refute those <HI>Reasons</HI> upon which it is <HI>Estab∣lished;</HI> 'til when, the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Certainty</HI> of the <HI>Thing</HI> remains <HI>Unshaken,</HI> tho' we can∣not <HI>Explain</HI> it, nor <HI>solve</HI> the <HI>Difficulties</HI> that arise from it.</P>
<P>And if it is so, upon the Point of <HI>Reason,</HI> much more upon that of <HI>Revelation,</HI> where the <HI>Subject Matter</HI> is above our <HI>Reason,</HI> and could never have been found out by it.</P>
<P>All to be done in that Case is, to satisfy our selves of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Fact,</HI> that such Things were <HI>Reveal'd</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and are no <HI>Imposture.</HI> This is done, as to the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures,</HI> by the <HI>Four Marks</HI> before mentioned.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Contradiction</HI> alledged in <HI>Three</HI> being <HI>One,</HI> it is no <HI>Contradiction,</HI> un∣less
<PB N="67" REF="003675_0066_10024512AF69E4C8"/>it be said, that <HI>Three</HI> are <HI>One,</HI> in the self∣same Respect: For in divers Respects, there is no Sort of Difficulty, that <HI>One</HI> may be <HI>Three,</HI> or <HI>Three Thousand;</HI> as <HI>One Army</HI> may consist of many <HI>Thousands,</HI> and yet it is but <HI>One Army:</HI> There is but <HI>One Human Nature,</HI> and yet there are <HI>Multitudes</HI> of <HI>Persons</HI> who partake of that <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is not said, that the Three <HI>Per∣sons</HI> in the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> are <HI>One Person;</HI> that would be a <HI>Contradiction:</HI> But it is said, that the <HI>Three Persons</HI> are <HI>One Nature.</HI> They are not <HI>Three</HI> and <HI>One,</HI> in the same Respect; they are <HI>Three</HI> as to <HI>Persons,</HI> and <HI>One</HI> as to <HI>Nature.</HI> Here is no <HI>Contradiction.</HI></P>
<P>Again, that may be a <HI>Contradiction</HI> in one Nature, which is not so in another: For Ex∣ample, it is a <HI>Contradiction,</HI> that a Man can go two <HI>Yards</HI> or <HI>Miles,</HI> as soon as <HI>One,</HI> be∣cause <HI>Two</HI> is but <HI>One</HI> and another <HI>One:</HI> Yet this is no <HI>Contradiction</HI> to <HI>Sight,</HI> which can reach a <HI>Star,</HI> as soon as the Top of a <HI>Chim∣ney;</HI> and the <HI>Sun</HI> darts his <HI>Rays</HI> in one <HI>In∣stant</HI> from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth:</HI> But more than all these is the Motion of <HI>Thought,</HI> to which no <HI>Distance</HI> of <HI>Place</HI> is any Interruption; which can arrive at <HI>Japan</HI> as soon as at a <HI>Yard</HI>'s Distance; and can run into the <HI>Im∣mensity</HI> of <HI>Possibilities.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are no <HI>Words</HI> possible, where∣by to give any <HI>Notion</HI> or <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Sight</HI> or
<PB N="68" REF="003675_0067_100244E4366E8648"/><HI>Eight</HI> to a Man born <HI>blind;</HI> and consequent∣ly, to reconcile the Progress of <HI>Sight</HI> or <HI>Light</HI> to him, from being an absolute <HI>Contradic∣tion;</HI> because he can measure it no otherwise than according to the Motion of <HI>Legs</HI> or <HI>Arms;</HI> for he knows none other: Therefore we can∣not charge that as a <HI>Contradiction</HI> in one <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> which is so in another, unless we un∣derstand both <HI>Natures</HI> perfectly well: And therefore we cannot charge that as a <HI>Contra∣diction</HI> in the <HI>Incomprehensible</HI> Nature of be∣ing <HI>Three</HI> and <HI>One,</HI> tho' we found it to be so in our <HI>Nature;</HI> which we do not, because, as before said, they are not <HI>Three</HI> and <HI>One</HI> in the same <HI>Respect.</HI></P>
<P>Now, let us consider further, that tho' there is no Comparison between <HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>Infinite,</HI> yet we have nearer <HI>Resemblances</HI> of the <HI>Three</HI> and <HI>One</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> than there is of <HI>Sight</HI> to a Man born <HI>blind:</HI> For there is no∣thing in any of the other four <HI>Senses</HI> that has any <HI>Resemblance</HI> at all to that of <HI>Seeing,</HI> or that can give such a Man any Notion what∣ever of it.</P>
<P>But we find in our own <HI>Nature,</HI> which is said to be made after the <HI>Image of God,</HI> a very near <HI>Resemblance</HI> of <HI>His Holy Trinity,</HI> and of the different <HI>Operations</HI> of each of the <HI>Divine Persons.</HI></P>
<P>For Example; to <HI>know</HI> a Thing <HI>present,</HI> and to <HI>remember</HI> what is <HI>past,</HI> and to <HI>love</HI> or
<PB N="69" REF="003675_0068_1002451510DDE2E8"/><HI>hate,</HI> are different <HI>Operations</HI> of our <HI>Mind,</HI> and perform'd by different <HI>Faculties</HI> of it. Of these, the <HI>Understanding</HI> is the <HI>Father</HI> Fa∣culty, and gives <HI>Being</HI> to Things, as to Us; for what we know not, is to Us as if it were not: This answers to <HI>Creation.</HI> From this <HI>Faculty</HI> proceeds the <HI>Second,</HI> that of <HI>Memo∣ry;</HI> which is a <HI>Preserving</HI> of what the <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> has <HI>Created</HI> to Us. Then the <HI>Third Faculty,</HI> that of the <HI>Will,</HI> which <HI>loves</HI> or <HI>hates,</HI> proceeds from <HI>Both</HI> the <HI>Other;</HI> for we cannot <HI>love</HI> or <HI>hate</HI> what is not first <HI>Cre∣ated</HI> by the <HI>Understanding,</HI> and <HI>Preserv'd</HI> to Us by the <HI>Memory.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' these are different <HI>Faculties,</HI> and their <HI>Operations</HI> different, that the <HI>Second</HI> proceeds from the <HI>First,</HI> or is <HI>Begotten</HI> by it; and the <HI>Third</HI> proceeds from the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Second</HI> in Conjunction; so that one is before the other, in Order of <HI>Nature,</HI> yet not in <HI>Time;</HI> for they are all <HI>Congenial,</HI> and one is as soon in the <HI>Soul</HI> as the other; and yet they make not <HI>Three Souls,</HI> but <HI>One Soul.</HI> And tho' their <HI>Operations</HI> are <HI>Different,</HI> and the one proceeds from the other, yet no one can act without the other, and they all <HI>concur</HI> to every <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>each;</HI> for in <HI>Underslanding</HI> and <HI>Remembring,</HI> there is a concurrent <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> to <HI>consent</HI> to such <HI>Underslanding</HI> or <HI>Re∣membring;</HI> so that no one can <HI>Act</HI> without the other; in which Sense, none is <HI>Before</HI> or
<PB N="70" REF="003675_0069_100244E696C1E5B0"/><HI>After</HI> the other; nor can any of them <HI>Be,</HI> or <HI>Exist,</HI> without the other.</P>
<P>But what we call <HI>Faculties</HI> in the <HI>Soul,</HI> we call <HI>Persons</HI> in the <HI>Godhead;</HI> because there are <HI>Personal</HI> Actions attributed to <HI>Each</HI> of them; as that of <HI>Sending,</HI> and being <HI>Sent,</HI> to take <HI>Flesh,</HI> and be <HI>Born,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And we have no other <HI>Word,</HI> whereby to Express it; we speak it after the Manner of Men; nor could we understand, if we heard any of those <HI>Unspeakable Words,</HI> which ex∣press the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> in its proper <HI>Es∣sence;</HI> therefore we must make <HI>Allowances,</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> ones, when we apply <HI>Words</HI> of our <HI>Nature,</HI> to the <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Eternal Being.</HI> We must not argue <HI>Strictly</HI> and <HI>Philosphical∣ly</HI> from them, more than from <HI>God</HI>'s being said to <HI>Repent,</HI> to be <HI>Angry,</HI> &amp;c. They are Words <HI>ad Captum,</HI> in Condescension to our weak <HI>Capacities,</HI> and without which we could not understand.</P>
<P>But this I say, That there are nearer <HI>Re∣semblances</HI> afforded to us of this ineffable <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> than there is betwixt one of our outward <HI>Senses</HI> and ano∣ther; than the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is to a <HI>blind Man</HI> of <HI>Colours,</HI> or of the <HI>Motion of Light,</HI> or <HI>Sight:</HI> And a <HI>Contradiction</HI> in the one will not infer a <HI>Con∣tradiction</HI> in the other; tho' it is impossible to be solv'd, as in the Instance before given of a Man born <HI>blind,</HI> 'til we come to <HI>Know</HI> both <HI>Natures</HI> dislinctly.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="003675_0070_10024518514FA400"/>
And if we had not the <HI>Experience</HI> of the different <HI>Faculties</HI> of our <HI>Mind,</HI> the <HI>Contra∣diction</HI> would appear <HI>irreconcileable</HI> to all our <HI>Philosophy,</HI> how <HI>Three</HI> could be <HI>One,</HI> each <HI>distinct</HI> from the other, yet but one <HI>Soul;</HI> One proceeding from, or being <HI>Begot</HI> by the other; and yet all <HI>coeval,</HI> and none <HI>before</HI> or <HI>after</HI> the other: And as to the Difference betwixt <HI>Faculties</HI> and <HI>Persons, Subslance</HI> and <HI>Subsistence,</HI> it is a puzling Piece of <HI>Philosophy.</HI> And tho' we give not a distinct <HI>Subsistence</HI> to a <HI>Faculty,</HI> it has an <HI>Existence;</HI> and one <HI>Fa∣culty</HI> can no more be another, than one <HI>Per∣son</HI> can be another: So that the Case seems to be alike in both, as to what concerns our present Difficulty of <HI>Three</HI> and <HI>One;</HI> besides what before is said, That by the Word <HI>Per∣son,</HI> when apply'd to <HI>God,</HI> for Want of a pro∣per Word whereby to express it, we must mean something infinitely different from <HI>Per∣sonality</HI> among <HI>Men.</HI> And therefore from a <HI>Contradiction</HI> in the one, (suppose it granted) we cannot charge a <HI>Contradiction</HI> in the o∣ther, unless we <HI>Understand</HI> it as well as the other; for how else can we draw the <HI>Parallel?</HI></P>
<P>What a vain Thing is our <HI>Philosophy,</HI> when we would <HI>Measure</HI> the <HI>Incomprehensible Na∣ture</HI> by it! When we find it <HI>non-plust</HI> in our own <HI>Nature,</HI> and that in many Instances. If I am <HI>All</HI> in one <HI>Room,</HI> is it not a <HI>Contradic∣tion,</HI> that any <HI>Part</HI> of me should be in ano∣ther
<PB N="72" REF="003675_0071_100244E81EB2B808"/><HI>Room?</HI> Yet it was a common Saying among <HI>Philosophers,</HI> that the <HI>Soul</HI> is <HI>All in All,</HI> and <HI>All</HI> in every <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Body:</HI> How is the same Individual <HI>Soul</HI> Present, at one and the same <HI>Time,</HI> to <HI>Actuate</HI> the distant <HI>Members</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> without either <HI>Multi∣plication</HI> or <HI>Division</HI> of the <HI>Soul?</HI> Is there any Thing in <HI>Body</HI> can bear any Resemblance to this, without a manifest <HI>Contradiction?</HI> Nay, even as to <HI>Bodies,</HI> is any Thing more a self-evident <HI>Principle,</HI> than that the <HI>Cause</HI> must be before the <HI>Effect?</HI> Yet the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> are as <HI>old</HI> as the <HI>Sun;</HI> and suppo∣sing the <HI>Sun</HI> to be <HI>eternal,</HI> they would be as <HI>eternal.</HI></P>
<P>And as <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> are of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and as the <HI>Three Faculties</HI> before mentioned are of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> so that the <HI>Soul</HI> could not be a <HI>Soul,</HI> if it wanted any of them; so may we, from <HI>small</HI> Things to <HI>great,</HI> apprehend without any <HI>Contradic∣tion,</HI> that the <HI>Three Persons</HI> are of the very <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Essence</HI> of the <HI>Deity;</HI> and so of the same <HI>Substance</HI> with it; and tho' one <HI>pro∣ceeding</HI> from the other, (as the <HI>Faculties</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> do,) yet that all <HI>Three</HI> are <HI>Consub∣stantial, Coeternal,</HI> and of <HI>necessary</HI> Existence as <HI>God</HI> is; for that these <HI>Three</HI> are <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> is these <HI>Three.</HI> As <HI>Understanding, Me∣mory,</HI> and <HI>Will</HI> are a <HI>Soul,</HI> and a <HI>Soul</HI> is <HI>Un∣derstanding, Memory,</HI> and <HI>Will.</HI></P>

<P>But now, that from all the Proofs of the <HI>Certainty</HI> of the <HI>Revelation</HI> we are come to Fix in <HI>Christianity,</HI> our Labour is not yet at an End: For here you see Multiplicity of <HI>Sects</HI> and <HI>Divisions,</HI> which our <HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> foretold should come, for the Probation of the <HI>Elect;</HI> as some <HI>Canaanites</HI> were lest in the Land, to teach the <HI>Israelites</HI> the Use of <HI>War,</HI> lest by too profound a Peace, they might gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w <HI>Lazy</HI> and <HI>Stupid,</HI> and become an easy <HI>Prey</HI> to their <HI>Enemies.</HI> So might <HI>Christianity</HI> be lost among us; if we had nothing to do, it would <HI>Dwindle</HI> and <HI>Decay,</HI> and <HI>Corrupt</HI> by Degrees, as <HI>Water</HI> Stagnates by standing still: But when we are put to <HI>Contend Earnestly for the Faith,</HI> it Quickens our Zeal, keeps Us upon our <HI>Guard,</HI> Trims our <HI>Lamp,</HI> and <HI>Furbishes</HI> the <HI>Sword</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which might otherwise <HI>Rust</HI> in its <HI>Scabbard.</HI> And it gives great Opportunity to shew the won∣derful <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of GOD

<HEAD>VI. <HI>The Doctrine of</HI> Satisfaction.</HEAD>
<P>Here is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> That when <HI>Man</HI> had <HI>Sinned,</HI> and was utterly unable to make any <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for his <HI>Sin, God</HI> sent his own <HI>Son</HI> to take up∣on him our <HI>Flesh,</HI> and in the same <HI>Nature</HI> that <HI>Offended,</HI> to make full <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for the <HI>Sins</HI> of the whole World by his perfect <HI>Obedience,</HI> and the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Himself</HI> upon the Cross.</P>
<P>Some say, What need any <HI>Satisfaction?</HI> Might not <HI>God</HI> forgive without it? It would shew greater <HI>Mercy.</HI> But these Men consi∣der not, that <HI>God</HI> is not only <HI>Just,</HI> but He is <HI>Justice</HI> it self; <HI>Justice</HI> in the <HI>Abstract;</HI> He is <HI>Essential Justice,</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> by its <HI>Nature,</HI> must exact to the utmost <HI>Farthing,</HI> else it were not <HI>Justice:</HI> To <HI>Remit</HI> is <HI>Mercy,</HI> it is not <HI>Jus∣tice:</HI> And the <HI>Attributes</HI> of <HI>God</HI> must not <HI>Fight</HI> and <HI>Oppose</HI> each other; they must all stand <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Compleat.</HI> You may say then, How can <HI>God</HI> forgive at all? How can Infinite <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> stand together?</P>
<P>This Question could never have been an∣swer'd, if <HI>God</HI> Himself had not shew'd it to Us in the wonderful <HI>OEcconomy</HI> of our <HI>Re∣demption:</HI> For here is His Justice satisfy'd to the least <HI>Jota,</HI> by the perfect <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Passion</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> who is <HI>God,</HI> in the same
<PB N="76" REF="003675_0075_100244ED5BAA88E8"/><HI>Humane Nature</HI> that <HI>Offended.</HI> Here is In∣finite <HI>Wisdom</HI> express'd in this <HI>Means</HI> found out for our <HI>Salvation;</HI> and Infinite <HI>Mercy</HI> in affording it to us.

His <HI>Mercy</HI> Exalts and Magnifies His <HI>Justice,</HI> His <HI>Justice</HI> Exalts His <HI>Mercy,</HI> and both His Infinite <HI>Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a View of <HI>God,</HI> beyond what all the <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Reason</HI> could ever have found out, from His <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Creation,</HI> or Common <HI>Providence!</HI> These shew his <HI>Works,</HI> but this his <HI>Nature!</HI> It is <HI>Himself!</HI> The very Face of <HI>God!</HI> Before which the <HI>Angels</HI> veil their <HI>Faces,</HI> and desire to look into this Abyss of <HI>Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Wisdom;</HI> which they will never be able to <HI>Fathom,</HI> but still <HI>Feed</HI> upon, and <HI>Search</HI> farther and farther in∣to it, with <HI>Adoration,</HI> to <HI>Eternity!</HI> And they <HI>Worship</HI> our <HI>Manhood</HI> thus taken into <HI>God!</HI> And <HI>Rejoice</HI> to be <HI>Ministring Spirits</HI> to us, while upon <HI>Earth.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Power</HI> was Delegated by <HI>Christ</HI> to His <HI>Apostles,</HI> and their <HI>Successors,</HI> to the End of the World: Accordingly the <HI>Apostles</HI> did ordain <HI>Bishops</HI> in all the <HI>Churches</HI> which they planted throughout the whole World, as the Supream <HI>Governors,</HI> and Centre of <HI>Unity,</HI> each in his own <HI>Church.</HI> These were obliged to keep <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Communion</HI> with one ano∣ther; which is therefore called the <HI>Catholick Church;</HI> as the several <HI>Nations</HI> of the Earth are called the <HI>World.</HI></P>

<HEAD>XII. <HI>Of</HI> Infallibility <HI>in the</HI> Church.</HEAD>
<P>But there is an <HI>Infallibility</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> not <HI>Personal</HI> in any <HI>One,</HI> or <HI>All</HI> of <HI>Christians</HI> put together; for Millions of <HI>Fallibles</HI> can never make an <HI>Infallible.</HI> But the <HI>Infalli∣bility</HI> consists in the Nature of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> which having all the Four <HI>Marks</HI> mentioned in <HI>The Short Method with the</HI> Deists, can∣not possibly be false. As you and I believe there is such a Town as <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that there was such a Man as <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. as much as if we had seen them with our Eyes: Not from the Credit of any <HI>Historian,</HI> or <HI>Travel∣ler,</HI> all of whom are <HI>Fallible;</HI> but from the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> wherein it is <HI>Im∣possible</HI> for Men to have conspir'd and car∣ry'd it on without <HI>Contradiction,</HI> if it were <HI>False.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, whatever <HI>Doctrine</HI> has been taught in the <HI>Church,</HI> (according to the Rule of <HI>Vincentius Lirinensis,</HI>) <HI>semper, ubique, &amp;
<PB N="84" REF="003675_0083_100244F5E82A4D88"/>ab omnibus,</HI> is the <HI>Christian Doctrine;</HI> for in this Case, such <HI>Doctrine</HI> is a <HI>Fact,</HI> and having the foresaid <HI>Marks,</HI> must be a true <HI>Fact, viz.</HI> That such <HI>Doctrine</HI> was so taught and receiv'd.</P>
<P>This was the Method taken in the <HI>Council</HI> call'd at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> against <HI>Arius;</HI> it was ask'd by <HI>Alexander,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> who presided, <HI>Quis unquam talia audivit?</HI> Who ever heard of this <HI>Doctrine</HI> before? And it being answered by all the Bishops there assem∣bled in the Negative, it was concluded a <HI>No∣vel Doctrine,</HI> and contrary to what had been <HI>Universally</HI> received in the <HI>Christian Church.</HI> Thus every <HI>Doctrine</HI> may be reduc'd to <HI>Fact;</HI> for it is purely <HI>Fact,</HI> whether such <HI>Doctrine</HI> was receiv'd, or not.</P>
<P>And a <HI>Council</HI> assembled upon such an Oc∣casion, <HI>stand</HI> as <HI>Evidences</HI> of the <HI>Fact,</HI> not as <HI>Judges</HI> of the <HI>Faith;</HI> which they cannot al∣ter by their <HI>Votes</HI> or <HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Council</HI> has <HI>Authority</HI> in Matters of <HI>Dis∣cipline</HI> in the <HI>Church;</HI> but in Matters of <HI>Faith,</HI> what is called their <HI>Authority,</HI> is their <HI>Attestation</HI> to the <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Fact;</HI> which, if it has the <HI>Marks</HI> before mentioned, must be <HI>Infallibly</HI> true: Not from the <HI>Infallibility</HI> of any or all of the <HI>Persons,</HI> but from the Na∣ture of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> as before is said.</P>
<P>And this is the surest Rule, whereby to <HI>Judge</HI> of <HI>Doc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rines,</HI> and to know what the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> has <HI>Believ'd</HI> and <HI>Taught,</HI> as <HI>Receiv'd</HI> from the <HI>Apostles.</HI></P>

This was the Current Notion and Language of Antiquity. <HI>Omnes Aposto∣lorum Successores sunt.</HI> That all Bishops were the <HI>Successors</HI> of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> as St. <HI>Jerom</HI> speaks, <HI>Epist. ad Evag.</HI> And St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> who was constituted by the Apostles <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Antioch,</HI> salutes the Church of the <HI>Tral∣lians, In the Plenitude of the Apostolical Character.</HI> Thus it continu'd from the Days of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> to those of <HI>John Calvin.</HI> In all which Time there was not any one Church in the whole Christian World that was not <HI>Episcopal.</HI> But now it is said by our <HI>Dissenters,</HI> That there is no Need of <HI>Succes∣sion</HI> from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> or those Bishops insti∣tuted by them; that they can make <HI>Gover∣nors</HI> over themselves whom they list: And what signifies the Government of the <HI>Church,</HI> so the <HI>Doctrine</HI> be pure? But this totally dis∣solves the <HI>Church</HI> as a <HI>Society;</HI> the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> of which consists in the Right and Title of the <HI>Governor.</HI> And, as the Apostle says, <HI>No Man taketh this Honour to him∣self,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 5.4.</NOTE> but he that is called of God, as was</HI> Aaron. And the Dispute betwixt him and <HI>Korah</HI> was not as to any Point either of <HI>Doctrine</HI> or <HI>Worship,</HI> but meerly upon that
<PB N="87" REF="003675_0086_10024528C6C2B298"/>of <HI>Church Government.</HI> And St. <HI>Jude, ver.</HI> 11. brings down the same Case to that of the <HI>Chris∣tian Church;</HI> and Reason carries it to all <HI>So∣cieties.</HI> They who will not obey the law∣ful <HI>Governor,</HI> but set up another in Opposi∣tion to him, are no longer of the <HI>Society,</HI> but <HI>Enemies</HI> to it, and justly forfeit all the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Now Considering that all the <HI>Promises</HI> in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> are made to the <HI>Church,</HI> what a dreadful Thing must it be, to be <HI>Excluded</HI> from all these!</P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Church</HI> is called the <HI>Pillar and Ground of the Truth,</HI> as being a <HI>Society</HI> insti∣tuted by <HI>Christ,</HI> for the Support and Preser∣vation of the <HI>Faith.</HI> This no particular <HI>Church</HI> can attribute to it self, otherwise than as being a <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Whole:</HI> And therefore, as St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> says, <HI>Christ made the College of Bishops numerous, that if one prov'd Heretical, or sought to devour the Flock, the rest might interpose for the Saving of it.</HI> This is equally against letting the whole depend upon one <HI>Universal Bishop,</HI> and a∣gainst throwing off the whole <HI>Epis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opate;</HI> that is, all the <HI>Bishops</HI> in the World; which would be a total <HI>Dissolution</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> as a <HI>Society,</HI> by leaving no <HI>Governors</HI> in it; or which is the same, setting up <HI>Governors</HI> of our own Head, without any <HI>Authority</HI> or <HI>Succession</HI> from the <HI>Apostles;</HI> which is rendring
<PB N="88" REF="003675_0087_100244FB8829FF10"/>the whole precarious, and without any Foun∣dation. And it is a supposing that Provi∣dence is more oblig'd to stand by a <HI>Church</HI> set up in direct <HI>Opposition</HI> to his <HI>Institution,</HI> than by that <HI>Church</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> Himself has <HI>founde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and promis'd to be with it to the <HI>End of the World.</HI> And tho' he has permit∣ted <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Heresies</HI> to overspread several Parts of it, at several Times, for the Proba∣tion of the <HI>Elect,</HI> like the <HI>Waining</HI> of the <HI>Moon,</HI> yet has He not lest <HI>Himself</HI> without <HI>Witness,</HI> and has rescor'd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight</HI> to Her, pur∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant to His Promise, <HI>That the Gates of Hell should not prevail against Her▪</HI> And this by the Means of his <HI>Servants</HI> and <HI>Substitutes,</HI> the <HI>Bishops</HI> of his <HI>Church,</HI> whom He has not deserted. All of whom, through the whole World always did, and still do maintain and own the <HI>Apostolick Creed.</HI> And wherein some, as the <HI>Arians,</HI> have perverted the Sense of some Articles, that lasted but a short Time; and the <HI>Truth</HI> has been more confirm'd by it, in the unanimous <HI>Consent</HI> and <HI>Testimo∣ny</HI> of the whole <HI>Episcopal College,</HI> to the <HI>Pri∣mitive Doctrine</HI> which they had receiv'd from <HI>Beginning.</HI> God heal'd these <HI>Heresies</HI> in his own Way, by the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Governors</HI> of His <HI>Church,</HI> whom He had appointed, and without any <HI>Infraction</HI> upon his own <HI>Institution.</HI></P>
<P>And it is observable, That these <HI>Heresies</HI> began by <HI>Infraction</HI> which Men made upon
<PB N="89" REF="003675_0088_1002452A9F8AE7C8"/>His <HI>Institution</HI> of <HI>Bisheps;</HI> as <HI>Arius,</HI> an am∣bitious <HI>Presbyter,</HI> first rose up against his <HI>Bishop,</HI> before he was given up to that vile <HI>Heresy,</HI> which he vented afterwards by De∣grees, to gain a Party after him, thereby to maintain the <HI>Opposition</HI> which he had made against his <HI>Bishop:</HI> And by a just Judgment, be <HI>Fell</HI> from one <HI>Error</HI> to another, 'till he at last compleated that detestable <HI>Heresy</HI> which bears his <HI>Name.</HI></P>
<P>And in all the <HI>Annals</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> whe∣ther under the <HI>Law,</HI> or the <HI>Gospel,</HI> there is not one <HI>Instance</HI> of a <HI>Schism</HI> against the <HI>Priest∣hood,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> had appointed, but great <HI>Errors</HI> in <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> did follow it. Thus the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> which <HI>Micah</HI> set up of his own Head, and that which <HI>Jero∣boam</HI> set up in Opposition to that of <HI>Aaron,</HI> both ended in <HI>Idolatry.</HI> Thus the <HI>Novitians</HI> and <HI>Donatists,</HI> who made <HI>Schisms</HI> against their <HI>Bishops,</HI> fell into grievous <HI>Errors,</HI> tho' they did not renounce the <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>And into what gross <HI>Errors,</HI> both as to <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> has the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> fallen, since her <HI>Bishop</HI> set up for <HI>Universa∣lity,</HI> and thereby Commenc'd that Grand <HI>Schism</HI> against all the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the Earth, whom he sought to <HI>Depress</HI> under him; but while he would thrust other <HI>Churches</HI> from him, he thrust himself from the <HI>Catholick Church.</HI></P>

What Hydra <HI>Heresies,</HI> and Monstrous <HI>Sects, (Fifty</HI> or <HI>Sixty</HI> at one Time, of which we have the <HI>Names,</HI>) flow'd like a <HI>Torrent</HI> in∣to <HI>England,</HI> in the Times of <HI>Forty One,</HI> af∣ter <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was thrown down.</P>
<P>So evident is that Saying, That the <HI>Church is the Pillar and Ground of the Truth,</HI> that we can hardly find any <HI>Error</HI> which has come into the <HI>Church,</HI> but upon an <HI>Infraction</HI> made upon the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Authority.</P>
