<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Grand-Jury;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are now met here for the Service of this City and County, and in order that you may be better enabled to perform this Service, and discharge the Duty inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bent on you, I shall say something to you of the Oath you have taken, to declare the Nature of it, and what is required thereby, at your hands, and then I shall proceed to mention and explain to you some of the Offences that are to be the subject of your Enquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003812_0002_10025F78D9282B98"/>Before I enter into the Particulars of your Oath, it may not, I think, be improper to say something, in the first place, of the Nature of <HI>Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in general.</P>
<P>An <HI>Oath</HI> then is a Religious Asseveration, by which we either Re∣nounce the Mercy, or imprecate the Vengeance of Heaven, if we speak not the Truth. This appears from the form of words in which it is expressed, to wit, <HI>So help you God.</HI> This is look'd upon as the most Sacred Tye, the strongest Band on Mens Minds, the surest and best means to find out and discover the Truth; for it is not to be imagined, though some few may possibly be found so hardned in sin, that Men in general will be so daring as to appeal to the GOD of Infinite Knowledge and Power, for the Truth of what they say, and yet Corruptly and Will∣fully Perjure themselves. Gods Infinite Knowledge must discern the Crime, and by his Power he will certainly punish the Breach o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his express Command which he has given, <HI>Ye shall not Swear Falsly by my Name, Neither shalt thou Profane the Name of thy God,</HI>—He that Sweareth unto his Neighbour, and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own Hindrance, is part of the Character of a <HI>Just Man, and one who should dwell in the Tabernacle of the Lord,</HI> — Even the Heathens have abhorred <HI>Perjury</HI> as an Odious Crime, looking on it as the greatest Impiety towards their Gods, and a Dissolution of the strongest Band of Human Society, of which many Instances might be given; but I rather chuse to exhort you to your <HI>Duty</HI> by Motives drawn <HI>from the Precepts of the Law of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, as to your <HI>OATH,</HI> the first Things required in it, are <HI>Diligence</HI> in your <HI>Enquiries,</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> in your <HI>Presentments. You shall Diligently Enquire, and True Presentment make. Diligence</HI> is to spur you on in finding out <HI>Offenders,</HI> that their <HI>Crimes</HI> may be <HI>Detected,</HI> and that they may be brought to <HI>Condign Punishment,</HI> according to their Demerits, and <HI>Truth</HI> is to be your <HI>Guide,</HI> the <HI>Compass</HI> you are to steer by, that the <HI>Innocent</HI> be not called into <HI>Judgment,</HI> and that the <HI>Guilty</HI> escape Not.</P>
<P>AND this <HI>Enquiry</HI> is to be of all such Matters as shall be given you in <HI>Charge,</HI> or shall come to your <HI>Knowledge;</HI> for as you are chosen from the different Parts of this City, it is to be presumed, that you must have heard of most Things which happen within it.</P>
<P>NEXT follows, <HI>The King's Counsel, your Fellows and your Own, you shall keep Secret.</HI> By the <HI>King's Counsel</HI> is to be understood the <HI>Evidence</HI> of the <HI>Witnesses</HI> who are brought before you, which ought not to be disclosed by any of you, but is to be kept Secret, and concealed from the Party concerned, and all others. For, tho' possibly at this time there may not be sufficient Evidence against an <HI>Offender,</HI> yet upon a farther Enquiry and Examination, a succeeding <HI>Grand Jury</HI> may find Matter enough against him to ground an <HI>Indictment</HI> on; and therefore the Par∣ticulars ought to be kept Secret, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the Discovery prove an Occasion of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> escaping.</HI> As you are to keep the <HI>King's Counsel,</HI> so are you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellows</HI> and <HI>your Own to keep Secret.</HI> You are Not to
<PB N="3" REF="003812_0003_10025F7A5FF1E6F8"/>
Reveal, for the same Reasons, what has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Advised among <HI>your Selves;</HI> for besides the <HI>Obligation</HI> of your <HI>Oath,</HI> it is an <HI>Offence</HI> punishable by <HI>Fine</HI> and <HI>Imprisonment,</HI> for any of the <HI>Grand Jury</HI> to disclose the <HI>Persons Indicted,</HI> or the <HI>Evidence against them.</HI></P>
<P>THE Next thing considerable in your <HI>Oath</HI> is, <HI>The Temper of Mind you ought to bear in all your Enquiries.</HI> You are not to suffer <HI>Malice</HI> or <HI>Ill-Will</HI> so far to prevail with you, as, without just Cause, to <HI>Present</HI> an <HI>Innocent Person,</HI> neither ought <HI>Love, Fear, Favour, Affection, Reward</HI> or <HI>Hopes</HI> thereof, sway you to leave any thing <HI>Unpresented;</HI> for your <HI>Oath</HI> ought to out-weigh any Considerations: And you ought to <HI>Present</HI> things Truly, as they come to your Knowledge. <HI>Truth</HI> is the <HI>Rule</HI> you are to walk by, and is the most Essential part of your <HI>Duty,</HI> and if of so much Consideration in the Service to which you are now chosen, that it forms the Beginning and Conclusion of the Oath you have taken. And all this that is required of you, is to be performed accor∣ding to the best of your <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Now as some general Notion of what the Law declares to be <HI>Offences,</HI> is requisite to this End, it is the Office of Us who sit here, to assist and direct you. And this leads me to mention some Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen;</HI></P>
<P>We commonly divide <HI>Offences</HI> as they relate to the Persons against whom they are committed; and they are said to be either against the <HI>Supreme Being, GOD,</HI> or against <HI>MAN.</HI> As to Offences against <HI>God,</HI> they may be considered under <HI>Two Heads.</HI> They are either such as, although in themselves they are <HI>Crimes</HI> of the <HI>deepest Dye,</HI> yet as they have not so direct a tendency, as some others, to <HI>Subvert Civil Society,</HI> our Laws have not provided Punishments suitable to them, but they are left to that <HI>Tribunal</HI> at which they are most properly Cognizable, and to that <HI>Judge</HI> to whom <HI>Vengeance</HI> belongeth. Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> They are such as at the same time that they are <HI>high Offences</HI> against <HI>God</HI> have also an immediate and manifest tendency to <HI>Overthrow the Peace</HI> and <HI>Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Well-being of every Community.</HI> The latter <HI>(Gentlemen)</HI> are the <HI>Object of Human Laws;</HI> Not that these can add any weight or Authority to the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> but because <HI>Temporal Punishments</HI> being nearer in view, are apt to work more strongly on weak and inconsiderate Minds than the distant, though far <HI>greater Punishments of another Life.</HI> Under this Head I think it not improper to place <HI>Perjury,</HI> or <HI>Breach of Oath,</HI> which I touched before. This is a <HI>Crime</HI> of a <HI>most Odious</HI> and <HI>Detestable Nature;</HI> it is the <HI>highest Indignity</HI> and <HI>Affront to God,</HI> and it <HI>loosens</HI> and <HI>dissolves</HI> the <HI>Bands of Society;</HI> for if Men lay aside all respect to the <HI>Obligation of an Oath,</HI> there must be an end of all <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Judi∣cature:</HI> We have no other Mean to judge of <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong, Truth</HI> or <HI>Falshood;</HI> nor any Security left for our <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties;</HI> All must run into Confusion, when the <HI>Reverence</HI> for this <HI>Solemn Appeal</HI> to <HI>Almighty God</HI> is once <HI>extinguished</HI> in Mens Minds. This cannot be too often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nculcated, and requires your utmost Diligence.</P>
<P><HI>Offences</HI> against <HI>Man,</HI> are of Two sorts, they are either more immediately against the <HI>King,</HI> or more immediately against the <HI>Subject.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003812_0004_10025F7CD862D028"/><HI>Offences</HI> against the <HI>King</HI> more immediately, are <HI>High-Treasons</HI> are <HI>Misprisions of Treasons.</HI> Under this Head I shall only mention are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and that is <HI>Levying War against the King;</HI> and to this Purpose I shall read a Paragraph or two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of <HI>Howk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s's He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Crown,</HI> Chapter <HI>of Treasons, Sect.</HI> 23, and 25. where recounting what Acts shall be said to amount to a <HI>Levying of War against the King,</HI> he says, <Q>That not only these who directly Rebel against the King, and take up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, but also in many other Cases, those who in a Violent are I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble Manner with-stand his Lawful Authority, or endeavour to Reform his Government, are said to <HI>Levy War against him."

<P>I Now Proceed to those <HI>Offences</HI> more immediately against the <HI>Subject.</HI></P>
<P>The highest of these is <HI>Petty Treason,</HI> which is, where a Wife Mur∣ders her Husband, or a Servant his Master. Now because of the Obedience they owe, and the Subjection they are under, respectively, the Law loo's upon this as a higher Crime than any other Murder.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Treasons</HI> are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elonies.</HI> And herein, <HI>first,</HI> of <HI>Homicide,</HI> which is the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling of a Man,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the word imports: Every <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cide</HI> is Voluntary or Involuntary.

Express</HI> is, where it is known, and may be proved, that there was a <HI>former G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge,</HI> some <HI>pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent Ill-Will</HI> between the Parties. <HI>Implyed,</HI> is, when one Man kills another <HI>without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Provocation.</HI> And here it is proper to observe, That <HI>No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. No Words, No Language,</HI> though never so Opprebious and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> will justifie or excuse <HI>Murder.</HI> If a Prisoner by the hard Usage of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, come to an Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly End, it is <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r is another sort of <HI>Voluntary Homicide,</HI> as where two Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a sudden, without any <HI>Malice prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt,</HI> and in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffle one of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rn.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003812_0005_10025F7E9929E500"/>Of <HI>Homicide Involuntary,</HI> some are <HI>per Infortunium,</HI> i. e. <HI>by Mischance,</HI> as a Man cutting down a Tree, which accidentally falls upon another, or the Ax flies from the Helve and kills a stander by, this is <HI>Chance-medley,</HI> or <HI>Homicide by Misadventure.</HI></P>
<P>Some are of <HI>Necessity,</HI> and of several sorts; <HI>First,</HI> In Execution of Justice, as an Officer that executes a Criminal in pursuance of a Judg∣ment of a Court that has legal Jurisdiction. <HI>Secondly,</HI> For Advancement of Justice, as where a Sheriff is going to Arrest a Person indicted of Felony, he may justifie the Killing him, if he will not suffer himself to be Arrested, but defends himself, so that the Officer cannot take him without killing him.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Homicides</HI> are justifiable, as if any Person Feloniously attempts to Rob or Murder another in or near the High-way, which is a com∣mon Passage that ought to be free and open to all Travellers, he may justifie the killing him. The same of an Attempt in the Night, to Rob a House; for a Mans House is his Castle, and the Law allows him to Defend himself in it, <HI>se defendendo,</HI> for the Killing a Man in the just Defence of Ones Self, is a <HI>Homicide Excuseable.</HI> This is founded on a Primary Law of Nature, which teaches us to be watchful of our own Preservation, and so excuses Resistance against an Unlawful Attempt on our Lives. But herein the Law is very careful not to give way to the sheding of Blood; for no one is excusable in this case, if he could by any means avoid it, without endangering himself, and he is obliged by our Law to retire back to the Wall, before he may make use of this Law of <HI>Self-Preservation,</HI> unless he be so fiercely assaulted, that he cannot. This ought always to be done <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Moderamine inculputae tatelae, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erly to preserve his own Life.</HI></P>
<P>In all cases of <HI>Homicides,</HI> the Law chiefly respects the Intention; for <HI>effectio tua nomen impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> operi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> i. e. The Intention give the Deno∣mination to every Action; and this is so much regarded by the Law, that Persons incapable of any, can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commit Murder, as a <HI>Mad-man,</HI> for no Action can be imputed to him, or properly be called his, and the killing another is not Felony in him, it is his Misfortune, and the Hand of God is upon him, but a Man that is <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compos mentis,</HI> i. e. of <HI>unsound Mind,</HI> his own Act, shall not be so excused, as a <HI>Drunken Man,</HI> if he commits <HI>Murder,</HI> his incapacity of Mind shall not avail him, because he brought it upon himself, it was his own Folly; and therfore the Law will supply the <HI>Malice,</HI> and he shall be hanged; <HI>Omne Crimes ebrietas et incendit et de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t;</HI> i. e. <HI>Drunkenness enflames and discovers every Crime;</HI> and no Man shall be allowed to excuse one Crime by another. These are the several kinds of <HI>Homicides,</HI> some whereof induce <HI>Forfeiture of Life,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Goods,</HI> as <HI>Murder,</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of <HI>Goods</HI> only, and are said in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to be excuseable, because they have their Pardon of course, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cide,</HI> in ones just Defence, or by Misadventure; and some of neither, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are called <HI>Homicides justifiable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003812_0006_10025F8136774878"/>I shall speak next of <HI>Felonies</HI> against the <HI>Habitation</HI> or <HI>Dwelling</HI> of a <HI>Man,</HI> the first of these is <HI>Burglary,</HI> which is, where one in the Night time breaks and enters the Dwelling-house of another, with intent to commit a <HI>Felony,</HI> although he carries nothing away, yet it is <HI>Burglery;</HI> for as the Day is designed for Man to Work and Labour, so is the Night for his Rest, to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able him the better to go through the Business of the Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and then the Law takes his Goods into its more immediate Care and Protection, in order to their greater Security: There must be a break∣ing; to take out a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of Glass Window, unlock the Door, draw the Latch, or make a hole in the Wall, these are all Breakings. A Man lies in one part of the House, his Servant in another, and between them there is a Door latch'd, and the Servant in the Night time draws the Latch, and enters his Masters Chamber to Murder him, though he does not effect it, yet it is <HI>Burglary.</HI> As there must be a <HI>breaking,</HI> so there must be an <HI>entring:</HI> Stepping over the Threshold, putting in the Hand, or a Hook, or a Pistol, within the Door or Window, all these the Law calls <HI>Entrings.</HI> A Thief broke a Pane in a Glass-Window, and took our Goods with a Hook, this was found to be <HI>Burglary.</HI> Several Men come to commit a <HI>Burglary,</HI> one breaks and enters, the others stay at the Door, or at the Corner of the Street, to watch; they are all guilty of <HI>Burglary:</HI> This by Law shall be adjudged the <HI>breaking</HI> and <HI>entring</HI> of them all.</P>
<P><HI>Arson</HI> is another <HI>Felony</HI> against the Habitation of a Man. If any do voluntarily and maliciously burn the Dwelling-house of another, this is called <HI>Arson,</HI> and is <HI>Felony.</HI> One <HI>Maliciously burns</HI> his own House to the intent to burn another's, if his own be only burnt, then it is a <HI>high Misde∣meanor;</HI> if the others also, then it is <HI>Felony.</HI></P>
<P>The next <HI>Felony</HI> I shall mention, is <HI>Robbery,</HI> which is a <HI>Violent</HI> and <HI>Fe∣lonious</HI> taking away from the Person of another, Money or Goods, to any Value, <HI>putting him in fear.</HI> If a Thief, with or without a Weapon drawn, bid me deliver my Purse, and I do it, it is a Taking sufficient to make it a <HI>Rob∣bery.</HI> If a man seeking to make his escape, cast his Purse into a Bush, or let his Hat fall off, the Thief takes them up, it is <HI>Robbery.</HI> Taking in the Presence of the Party, is, in Law, a Taking from the Person. If several come in Company together to Rob, the one only actually does it, and the others are at some distance, yet all are guilty of the Robbery.</P>
<P>These <HI>Felonies</HI> that I have mentioned, are called <HI>Mix'd Larcenies. Simple Larceny</HI> is the <HI>Felonious</HI> and <HI>Fraudulent</HI> taking away by any Person, of the the meer Personal Goods of another, not from his Person, nor out of his House; if this be above the Value of <HI>Twelve Pence,</HI> it is <HI>grand Larceny,</HI> if under, <HI>petty Larceny,</HI> for which the <HI>offender</HI> shall be <HI>whipt.</HI> If two steal G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds to the Value of <HI>Thirteen Pence,</HI> this is <HI>grand Larceny</HI> in both. If one Person at several times, at one time steals <HI>four Pence,</HI> at another <HI>six Pence,</HI> at ano∣ther <HI>three Pence,</HI> from one Person, in all amounting to above <HI>twelve pence,</HI> it is said, all these put together in one Indictment, amount to <HI>grand Larceny,</HI> and Judgment of <HI>Death</HI> must be given, unless in cases where Clergy is not taken away.</P>
<P>Most of these Offences that I have mentioned are <HI>Capital.</HI> I shall only take Notice of one or two which are not Capital, and then dismiss you

And <HI>first,</HI> of Offences which amount to an actual <HI>Breach of the Peace,</HI> they any of two kinds, 1st, Such as may be commited by one or two Persons. 2dly, Such as require a greater Number. Of the <HI>first</HI> sort are <HI>Assaults</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> these, if done to Persons of Note, or may have any ill Conse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nces, are worthy of your Enquiry. Of the <HI>second</HI> sort, are <HI>Riots</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ful Assemblies.</HI> A <HI>Riot</HI> is, when three or more Persons, do meet to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unlawful Act of a private Nature, and actually do it; for if it be of a <HI>Publick Nature,</HI> it may amount to that species of <HI>High-Treason,</HI> I before mentioned; but if they meet and do it not, then it is an <HI>unlawful Assembly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I shall conclude with reading a Paragraph or two out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Book, concerning <HI>Libels;</HI> they are arrived to that height, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for your Annimad version, it is high time to put a stop to them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Rate things are now carried on, when all <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ment</HI> is endeavoured to be <HI>Trampled on. Reflections</HI> are cast upon Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of all <HI>Degrees,</HI> must not these things end in <HI>Sedition,</HI> if not timely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enty you have seen will not avail, it becomes you then to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Offenders, that we may in a due course of Law be enabled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> if you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> do not interpose, consider whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that may arise from any Disturbances of the <HI>Publick</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, may not, in part, lye at your door?</P>
<P><HI>Hawkings</HI> in his Chapter of <HI>Libels</HI> considers three Points, 1st, What shall be said to be a <HI>Libel,</HI> 2dly, Who are lyable to be punished for it. 3dly, In what manner they are to be punish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Under the <HI>first,</HI> he says, <HI>Sect.</HI> 7. <Q>Nor can there be any doubt, but that Writing which defames a private Person only, is as much a <HI>Libel</HI> as that which defames Persons entrusted with a Pub∣lick Capacity, inasmuch as it manifestly tends to create all Blood, and to cause a Disturbance of the publick Peace; however, it is certain, that it is a very high aggravation of a <HI>Libel,</HI> that it tends to scandalize the Government, by reflecting on those who are entrusted with the Administration of publick Affairs, which doth not only endanger the publick Peace, as all other <HI>Libels</HI> do, by stiring up the Parties immediately concerned in it, to acts of Revenge, but also has a direct tendency to breed in the People a dislike of their Governours, and incline them to Faction and Sedition.</Q> <HI>As to the second Point, he says,</HI> Sect. <HI>10.</HI> <Q>It is certain, not only be who composes or procures another to compose it, but also that he who publishes, or procures another to publish it, are in danger of being punished for it; And it is said, not to be material whether he who disperses a <HI>Libel,</HI> knew any thing of the Contents or Effects of it, or not; for nothing could be more easie than to publish the most Virulent Papers with the greatest Security, if the concealing the purport of them from an illiterate Publisher, would make him safe in the dispersing them. Also, it hath been said That if he who hath either Read a <HI>Libel</HI> himself, or hath heard it Read by another, do afterwards Maliciously Read or Repeat any part of it in the presence of others, or lend or shew it to another, he is guilty of an Ʋnlaw∣ful Publication of it. Also, it hath been holden, that the Copying of a <HI>Libel</HI> shall be a conclusive Evidence of the Publication of it, unless the Party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n prove, that he delivered it to a Magistrate to examine it, in which case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubsiquent is said to explain the Intention precedent. But it seems
<PB N="8" REF="003812_0008_10025F84A690B228"/>
to be the better Opinion, That he who first writes a <HI>Libel,</HI> dictated by another, is thereby guilty of making it, and consequently punishable for the bare Writing; for it was no <HI>Libel</HI> till it was reduced to Writing.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You must have heard of two <HI>Scandalous Songs</HI> that are handed about, it is your Duty to enquire the Author, Printer and Publisher of them. Someties heavy half-witted Men get a knack of Rhyming, but it is time to break them of it, when they grow Abusive, Insolent and Mischievous with it.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>(Gentlemen)</HI> are some of the Offences which are to make Part of your Enquiries, and if any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould arise in the Course of your Proceedings, in which you are at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or conceive any Doubts, upon your Application here, We will ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd direct you.</P>
