<HEAD>II KINGS II. 12. —<HI>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel and the Horsemen thereof.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS was the cry of <HI>Elisha,</HI> when <HI>Elijah</HI> was taken from him. Though he must have the greatest assurance possible of his going to a state of rest and peace; yet he felt the greatest concern for himself and his people, under the sense of so great a loss; and therefore under this deep sense and concern, he cries out as in our text, <HI>My father, my father,</HI> &amp;c. as if it were possible to call him back to them again, that the nation might have and enjoy the great benefit of such an eminent man still longer. We have the like expression of the king of Israel to this same prophet, who uttered these words of our text, when he came to see him in his last sick∣ness. This king, though he was a wicked man, yet it seems he had so much sense and knowledge of the great safeguard so good a man was to his people; as to make him cry with this affecting cry, of words like our text; expressive of a deep sense of sustaining, or being about to sustain, a loss so great as even all the military force and de∣fence of the people. The calling any one father is a most engaging appellation: because a father is one on whom the child depends for help, sup∣port
<PB N="4" REF="012713_0004_0F8B8D848241F120"/>and defence. And the natural disposition in a father to grant help to a child, or attend to his cry, makes it the more important.</P>
<P>Again, what makes the text more important is the doubling the call, <HI>My father, my father;</HI> which implies earnestness, as though every breath was engaged. <HI>The chariot of Israel and the horse∣men thereof,</HI> are put in apposition with <HI>father:</HI> and the words no doubt are designed to carry this sense or idea; as if he had said, My father thou art the chariot of Israel: Thou art our safeguard. Or as if he he had said, By losing thee, we lose all the defensive force of the Nation. For again he says, <HI>My father, the horsemen of Israel.</HI> As if he had said, If you leave us we shall be left na∣ked of chariots and horsemen; or as defenceless as a people that have none; and oh how sad will our case be, when it is come to this, and we have so many enemies surrounding us, and seeking our de∣struction. O father, what shall we then do? O if you might but be continued with us! But now we are left defenceless.</P>
<P>By <HI>Elisha</HI>'s calling <HI>Elijah</HI> father, we are not to understand that he was his natural father, or indeed of any near kindred: but it is observably very com∣mon in scripture, for those in public stations, to be addressed or spoken of in that manner; especially those that well filled their places for the good of the people. As a father at the head of a fa∣mily takes care of, guides, instructs and provides for his family; so a good king or ruler, or priest, or prophet, very justly bears the title of a father to the people they stand in public relation to. Thus in our text: Thus in what the king of Israel said to <HI>Elisha</HI> when on his death-bed; and also when he asked him if he should smite the Syrians,
<PB N="5" REF="012713_0005_0F8B8D8542677E68"/>2 Kings 6.21. So <HI>Joseph</HI> is said to be made a father to <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> So also, Father is used for those of the same station or profession, who are advanced in years, as in our text. And hence the young prophets are called the sons of the prophets. In all these senses the word father is used in our text, as to age, station, and well filling a public place or character. And in all these we may use it in the case before us.</P>
<P>In treating upon this subject, we may attend to the following things, for illustration and im∣provement.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We may observe from the words, that the godly, especially when in a public station, are a great advantage and defence, as fathers to the people where they are.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>When such are taken away, it is just matter of very deep sorrow and lamentation to the people where they have lived.</HI></P>
<P>First then we are to attend to the illustration of the observation, <HI>That the godly, especially when in a public station, are a great advantage and de∣fence, as fathers to the people where they are.</HI></P>
<P>Our text, as well as the other text hinted, sets them forth to be not only as fathers, but as a de∣fence, as really as chariots and horsemen: yea, that but one eminently good man for safeguard, might be accounted to be as all the martial force of the nation. We accordingly find that God set forth his respect to good men in this light. Thus he spared the old world for a season, for the sake of some few good men; of whom we may reck∣on <HI>Methuselah</HI> as well as <HI>Noah.</HI> The flood was stayed, and nothing could be done, till one was in his grave, and the other in the ark. That self same day that <HI>Noah</HI> entered into the ark, the
<PB N="6" REF="012713_0006_0F8B8D876D7F2BC8"/>fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. As soon as all good men were out of the way; de∣struction did not wait upon the people one day. In like manner we find, when <HI>Sodom</HI> was destroy∣ed, the angel said he could do nothing, till <HI>Lot</HI> was out of the way: but, as soon as he was gone, not a moment delay before the dreadful storm of God's wrath was poured down upon them.</P>
<P>To the same purpose we find through the whole of God's dealings with the children of Israel. While they served the Lord and walked in his ways, things went well with them. Thus in the days of <HI>Joshua</HI> and the elders that out lived him, there was no one able to stand before them. But, as soon as all these good men were dead, they did evil in the sight of the Lord, and he sold them into the hand of spoilers that spoiled them. Judges II. 14. So, through the whole state of the Israelites, when they had a good king it went well with them. Thus in the days of <HI>Jo∣siah,</HI> God spared them from the destruction he had threatned them for the sins of <HI>Manasseh</HI> till after the death of <HI>Josiah.</HI> But, as soon as he was gone, breaches were made upon them one after another, till they were destroyed, and as it is expressed cast out of his sight. The world indeed stands for the sake of the elect. So it is expressed in the Revelation, those angels, that were appointed to destroy, were not permitted to hurt, till the elect were made safe.</P>
<P>God knows how to save them, that are his own, however the world may be involved in wicked∣ness; yet will withhold the letting forth his wrath and fury upon the ungodly, so long as it is for the good and safety of his chosen; so that they are a
<PB N="7" REF="012713_0007_0F8B8D8794A00F50"/>special safeguard and defence to all about them, that have any special connection with them.— Thus it may with the strictest truth be affirmed, that the pious and godly are not only as fathers; but a great and special defence to the people where they dwell.</P>
<P>We may now attend to some particulars shew∣ing, wherein they are such a safety and defence to their people.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are a safeguard to the people where they dwell by their good examples and persuasi∣ons, which have a great and constraining force with them to keep in awe the vicious, and to pre∣vent their out breakings of sin. Indeed many times vice gets so much the ascendence, that little regard or reverence is paid to the examples of the pious and godly, or even to their advice and per∣suasions. But when this is the case, it is a sign and evidence, that destruction is at the door. When the godly have lost all their influence upon those about them, 'tis a sign and evidence that their work is just done; and, when that is done, they will be taken to God himself, and destruction will speedily come upon those about them. Thus was the case of <HI>Lot;</HI> we find, just before the destructi∣on of <HI>Sodom,</HI> he had lost all his influence, and all he could say to them, met with no better than in∣sult. When he essayed to diswade them from that dreadful wickedness they were for doing to the angels, they say, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge; and go on to threaten and press upon him to abuse him; yea and when he went as a father to his sons in law, to forewarn them of their danger, they treated him with the utmost neglect; all which was the most immediate forerunner of that awful destruction.
<PB N="8" REF="012713_0008_0F8B8D88D2DE3340"/>The same also appears from what we read of the old man and the Levite, Judg. 19.22 and on∣ward. The most gentle perswasives and entrea∣ties had no effect upon those that beset the house, which appears to be the cause of dreadful desolati∣on as to the tribe they belonged to. Thus we may see, that when the godly have lost their influ∣ence, and neither their examples nor persuasions will avail, it is a leading to destruction, from which we may see, how or wherein they are a de∣fence by their good examples.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are not only a safeguard and defence by their examples and perswasions, but by their advice, exhortations and counsels, to reclaim the ungodly, and to keep them from running to so great lengths in their Sin. And not only so, but by their counsel and direction, how to conduct, they are a great advantage and defence; for God guideth the just; he ordereth their goings aright; he keepeth them in their way, so that their feet do not stumble; and, when a people have such among them, and will adhere to their advice, it makes their way safe. Such pious godly men, who have their dependance upon God, he will never leave nor forsake. Thus, while <HI>Jehoiada</HI> lived, and <HI>Jo∣ash</HI> followed his advice, he reigned well, and things prospered among them: but, after the death of <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> the king forsook the Lord, and it was but a little while before things began to decline, and in about the course of a year the host of <HI>Syria</HI> came against him, and destroyed all the princes of the people: For the army of the <HI>Syrians</HI> came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered into their hand a very great host, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers; so they executed judgment against <HI>Joash;</HI> see 2 Chron.
<PB N="9" REF="012713_0009_0F8B8D8955BF0440"/>24.23, &amp;c. There we see, how that the good instruction and counsel of <HI>Jeboiada</HI> was an advan∣tage and defence, and that as a father he guided and guarded the people, while he continued a∣mong them. Thus also we may reckon under this particular, that the godly are as fathers and a safeguard to their people by their prudence and wisdom, in advising and ordering affairs; for to such God giveth discretion. So a prudent woman once saved a city by her wisdom. When God designs good for a people, he raises up some with wisdom and prudence to lead and to guide them: but when a people are become so bad, that God determines evil for them, then he hides counsel from the wise, and understanding from the pru∣dent; or takes away the prudent from among them. It is not a <HI>meer political sagacity,</HI> that can guard and defend a people: but it must be a <HI>pious godly prudence,</HI> which is founded in a dependance, shel∣tering; so that here we may see how that the godly are a safeguard to the people where they are.</P>
<P N="3">3. They are as fathers and a special safeguard and defence to the people where they are, by their fervent prayers and frequent supplications to God for their people. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much; accordingly we find that the earnest and fervent prayers of <HI>Moses</HI> were from time to time attended with the salvation of the children of Israel from immediate destructi∣on. How often God threatned to destroy them in a moment, and, <HI>Moses</HI> interposing with his ear∣nest prayers and supplications, God turned from the fierceness of his anger, and would not destroy them. The same may be observed of the
<PB N="10" REF="012713_0010_0F8B8D8B811FB070"/>prayer of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Isaiah</HI> against the Assyri∣an army, and of <HI>Samuel</HI> against the <HI>Philistines,</HI> in both which they did more than all the chariots and horsemen of Israel could do: and many other instances to the same purpose may be found re∣corded in sacred writ; all which shews the safe∣guard the godly are by their prayers, more than all the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof.</P>
<P N="4">4. The godly are a safeguard to their people by their trusting in God. When a person trusts in God, nothing can hurt him; for <HI>The name of the Lord is a strong Tower; the righteous runneth into it and is safe,</HI> Prov. 18.10. To the same purpose also we read that <HI>The horse is prepared a∣gainst the day of battle: but safety is of the Lord,</HI> Prov. 21.31. The greatest and most terrible armies in array are of no avail, unless the Lord go forth with them. The prayers of a few godly men, who put their trust in the Lord, can blast and destroy the greatest armies, as appears in the case of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> above hinted, and many other places that might be mentioned. There is no safety, where there is no trust in God, and no dan∣ger where there is a gracious trust in him; for such were never confounded or put to shame. So that herein they are a special safeguard and defence, so long as people will hearken to them. But, as be∣fore observed, when they have lost their influence, and their work is thus come to a close, God soon takes away, removes them to some other place upon this earth, or takes them home to himself in his heavenly kingdom.</P>
<P N="5">5. Once more—The truly pious are an advan∣tage and defence, as fathers where they are, by their being public spirited; for there are none more public spirited than such; for they have a
<PB N="11" REF="012713_0011_0F8B8D8C0554F5B0"/>real and sincere love, tenderness, and benevolence toward all mankind: as fathers they delight to do good unto others; for they are the children of their father in heaven, who causes his sun to rise, and his rain to descend on the just and on the unjust, on the evil and the good: and thus they practice that, which has the strongest force to assi∣milate and unite all together, and so to strength∣en the whole body; which alone is that safeguard that can keep every body from destruction, and without which, as our Saviour says, houses and kingdoms cannot stand.</P>
<P>Thus we have considered some particulars, shewing, wherein the godly are a safeguard and defence as fathers to their people. We now pro∣ceed to our second general head proposed, viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider that, <HI>when such are taken a∣way, it is just matter of very deep sorrow and lam∣entation to the people where they have lived.</HI></P>
<P>Although it is <HI>much better</HI> for such godly per∣sons to be gone, and to be with Christ, than to be here in the body; yea great <HI>gain,</HI> because of the many troubles they have to meet with in this world. Though it is better for themselves to be gone; yet, for those where they have lived, it would be better, if they might be continued among them. To this effect the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaks, Philip. 1.23, 24. The godly are so great a protection to the people where they are, as we have above con∣sidered, that it is a very great loss for them to be taken away. In the illustration of this head, we may first take notice of some instances of mourn∣ing recorded in scripture when the pious and god∣ly were taken away.</P>
<P>In general it is remarked in scripture, that when any man of public note was taken away, if it was
<PB N="12" REF="012713_0012_0F8B8D8E1DDBC898"/>a pious and godly man, there was great mourning for him; but if it was a wicked man, there was little or no mourning for him. Thus when good old <HI>Jacob</HI> died, there was great mourning and lamentation for him; even the Egyptians were so sensible what a great loss it was, that they mourn∣ed with a very grievous cry. So also when <HI>Moses</HI> was taken away, all Israel mourned for him. He had long been their guide, their mediator; led, guided, guarded, fed, instructed them as their fa∣ther, and had been their law-giver; a man of so great usefulness, that they had indeed very great reason to lament the loss of him. So also we find, through the account of the kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> when a good king was taken away, there was special men∣tion of the people's mourning for him. Many instances of this kind are to be found in sacred writ: But we shall proceed to observe some rea∣sons, shewing, why it is such just matter of mourn∣ing when the godly are taken away.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because the people are stripped of their fa∣thers, their force, their guard; the chariots and horsemen of the people are gone; they are as a town invironed with enemies, and all their martial force removed, left naked to the inroads of their enemies, and nothing to look for, but that they shall soon be cut off, and made a desolation, unless God raises up some to succeed, who shall fill up their place. But when God takes away the faith∣ful of the earth, the Inhabitants thereof have great reason to look upon it as a testimony that God is angry with them: which is most just cause of mourning, that we have thus provoked him to anger, and to threaten to destroy us; and it is a loud call to a people to prostrate themselves in deep mourning for their sins; yea, with deep sorrow
<PB N="13" REF="012713_0013_0F8B8D8E43622A48"/>and repentance with unfeigned grief; that we have provoked him to strip us of such pillars of our welfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is just cause of mourning, because we are now deprived of their good examples. Albeit we may and ought to bear their examples in our minds, so that, after they are dead, they may yet so far speak to us in their good deeds, and be still an advantage to us after they are gone from us. And thus we should, at their departure, bear in our minds a deep sense of their importance, that we may the longer retain the advantage of their ex∣amples, and the blessedness of their memory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another thing contained in the loss a people sustain at the departure of a godly man, and makes it just cause of mourning, is the loss of their fervent prayers. Such bear upon their hearts before God all, that they stand nearly related to; like <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Job. Moses</HI> when any thing threatned his people, was importunate with God, till it was averted. <HI>Job</HI> ceased not every day to offer sacrifices for his children. Such as are pious good men wrestle with God for all about them. And, while God keeps up such pillars among his people, stirring up his servants to such fervent prayers, he will answer them; for he does <HI>not say to the seed of</HI> JACOB, <HI>seek ye me in vain.</HI> But when he takes away such from among a people, it is to be feared he is about to withdraw his favor from that people, and what can be a greater cause of mourning and lamentation? for then <HI>Ichabod</HI> is written upon all their concerns, the glory is de∣parted, church and state are in danger. This surely is cause of mourning when so many earnest prayers are ceased from among a people. What a great gap! What a great loss! How much it
<PB N="14" REF="012713_0014_0F8B8D8F08295EE8"/>calls for weeping, lamentation, and mourning!</P>
<P>Once more.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the godly are taken away from a∣mong a people, it is just cause of mourning to them, that now they have lost the comfort and benefit of their society. Man was made for society, and it is just cause of mourning, when a social companion is taken away; and especially, when it is one, whose company or society tended to make us wise; as the scriptures say, he that walk∣eth with the wise, shall be wise. But when a wise companion is taken from us, this is just matter of mourning, and will indeed be so to us, if we have any relish for that wisdom and piety, which grace the lives of the godly; mourning and grief, that we can no more enjoy that fellowship with them here upon earth. Thus we have considered some things, shewing the loss of the godly is such great cause of mourning. We may now attend to some</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>And now, beloved, may we not with great propriety apply and make improvement of this subject in the case before us? Have we not lost a pious godly <HI>Father,</HI> a father in age, a father in his being in a public station, a father in his good examples, a father in giving good advice and exhortations, a father in his fervent prayers, a father in his prudence and wisdom, a father in his tender concern for us, a father in his public spi∣ritedness, a father to his church and people, a father to the poor, a father to his younger bre∣thren in the ministry? And thus lost, a very great instrumental safety, defence, and protection; yea what <HI>Elisha</HI> in our text does not scruple speak
<PB N="15" REF="012713_0015_0F8B8D91312CA750"/>of as the whole martial defence of the people; for although <HI>Elijah</HI> stood only in a religious pub∣lick relation to <HI>Israel;</HI> yet his life was of that importance to their safety and defence. <HI>David,</HI> when <HI>Abner</HI> was killed, very greatly mourneck, when it was only a chief military man, and one, that had but newly turned to his side; and he reckons over his being weak and defenceless, and the greatness of the man lost, as the cause and matter of his great mourning: and if that was such just matter of mourning, grief and lamentation; how much more when a father, and all the defen∣sive force of the people is removed? Beloved, I claim share in considering him as a father, being myself a younger brother in the station he sustain∣ed; and which has led my mind to the considera∣tion, and applying the words of our text for your contemplation at this time.</P>
<P>And here, as we considered, that the godly were a safeguard by their good examples, so it may be to our purpose, to take a short view of the character of our kind and honoured father, who is taken away from us; praying, that, by thus viewing him, when he is taken from us, a double portion of his spirit may rest upon us, as it was promised <HI>Elisha,</HI> it should be unto him, if he saw <HI>Elijah</HI> taken from him. And especially, as he was in a public relation, and as a father both in age and station, we may with propriety look into his character, and hold it up for our imitation, as well as for our mourning on account of the loss of him.</P>
<P N="1">1. We shall take notice of one thing specially, that did not belong to his character, viz. <HI>Ostenta∣tion,</HI> or affecting to make a great shew in the world, of scholarship, or of importance, in polemick points or disputes. He was very far from shewing
<PB N="16" REF="012713_0016_0F8B8D9156570650"/>himself forward in any controversies; though he was by those, who were intimately acquainted with him, accounted an accurate scholar; and all he undertook, to effect it with great care and exact∣ness: not aspiring after that more public ap∣pearance, or an affectatious ostentation: or as a blazing star, that makes a great shew, and is so excentric in its orbit, that it is mostly upon ex∣tremes; either very near the sun, or at an indeffi∣nite distance from it; sometimes passing toward the sun with vehement swiftness, and then again receding with as great vehemency, in directly the reverse course from that, in which it but a little be∣fore passed toward the sun. This very curiously points forth to us, the case of those that make a great blaze in the world; and how they go the re∣verse one time of what they went but a little before. Not such an one was our <HI>Father</HI> taken from us. But he was a regular star, moving in the orb, in which God had placed him, with uniform lustre. Nor was he one of the dullest or obscurest stars, in re∣flecting light from the great <HI>Sun of righteousness.</HI> But it was of such brightness, that it shone with conspicuous light through the thick clouds that have for some years past obumbrated our nation and land.</P>
<P>The light which he eminently reflected from JESUS CHRIST the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, may be reckoned in a few particulars. 1. Pure and unfeigned love. The benevolence and com∣passion of a father, the kindness of a brother, the faithfulness of a friend, eminently appeared in him. His paternal compassion, no doubt every one of you can witness to, and especially the poor, which you have always with you; who have, I suppose,
<PB N="17" REF="012713_0017_0F8B8D922EDDB610"/>been many times fed, warmed, and relieved by his charitable bounty. His brotherly kindness has been abundantly felt by his brethren in the minis∣try, as I myself am witness; as well as also his fi∣delity as a friend.</P>
<P>In his most public exercises or performances at ordination solemnities, where it very frequently fell to his share to give the <HI>right hand of fellowship;</HI> a part which afforded him very ample occasion for expressing this noble affection; he was not wanting in shewing a most eminent degree of bro∣therly love and cordial affection toward his bre∣thren in the ministry, and the churches of God. I believe all, who have had the opportunity of at∣tending upon such occasions, can witness, how great he was in shewing this Christ-like affection. No less conspicuous did his light shine in this de∣sirable affection, wherever he was called to have any concern in divisions and difficulties in chur∣ches, wherein he always appeared to have a singu∣lar regard for the truth; as well as love and com∣passion for those that were borne upon. And in such affairs he did not put on two faces, and side with them that were next him; but steadily ad∣hered to the truth and honesty of the cause, and always shewed a very compassionate concern for the good, peace and comfort of the church of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But you have had abundant opportunity to ob∣serve, in his public discourses, what an uncommon degree of sincere love and tender affection appear∣ed. Thus it appeared to me in what little oppor∣tunity I have had of attending on his public dis∣pensations; and I cannot doubt, but it has much more appeared to you, who have for so many years
<PB N="18" REF="012713_0018_0F8B8D92C1D3D988"/>been favoured with distillings of divine dew, and gentle rain, from his pleasant voice. No less ami∣able and conspicuous, did this divine virtue of pure love and sincere friendship, appear in his more private affairs of life: He shewed a most friendly concern for the good, comfort and wel∣fare of all, wherever he came; even if he was on∣ly a wayfaring man, he was not wanting in shew∣ing a very singular concern for their welfare: so singular was he for this, that it might I suppose be said of him in this, as God said of <HI>Job,</HI> that there was none like him in all the earth, at least none that we know of. Thus he reflected from the divine sun an uncommon beam of singular love; which qualification is the fulfilling of the law: by which he appeared, abundantly endued with that singular disposition, of doing as he would be done by; which our Saviour says is the law and the prophets. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. We may remark another very eminent beam of light he reflected from the <HI>Sun of righ∣teousness</HI> was his <HI>Honesty,</HI> in which as to his pri∣vate affairs, he had, I suppose, the good report of all men; but his <HI>honesty</HI> in public character was most important and most conspicuous; and in this he shone with singular lustre. He was most friendly in his temper and disposition, kind and courteous: but yet he had no friend so near and dear to him as <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>honesty:</HI> he would aban∣don any friend, sooner than his conscience, or in he least deviate from truth and honesty, to which he was so closely attached, and for which he had so great a veneration; that not even the clofest friendship, could bribe him to turn aside from the truth; such light did he reflect from the <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> that he was a star of rare magnitude in this noble qualification.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="012713_0019_0F8B8D938247E0A8"/>
3. To sum up in a word; the light which he reflected from Christ the <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> he imitated his glorious Master in love, in patience, in doing good, and seeking the good both of the souls and bodies of men; giving up much of his worldly interest in his life-time; that by all means he might win some; and at his death, viz. in his last will and testament, having no heirs of his body, he made you the church of Christ his heir, in such a manner, as that you shall, from genera∣tion to generation forever, feel the effects of his propitious bounty; so that although after he had served his generation by the will of God, he fell asleep; yet he has made provision, whereby you his dear people may forever be fed, by the drop∣pings of the sanctuary, from the fruits of his la∣bours. Thus his life and his death were devoted to the good, the service, the well being of the church of Christ. Thus he lived Christ, as he held forth in his last publick labours; and we are in charity bound to believe he is now reaping that <HI>gain,</HI> which in the same subject, he held forth there was to such in <HI>death;</HI> and especially also, as those words appeared to be his support, and the refreshment of his soul, in his last hours under the apprehensions of the near approach of death.</P>
<P N="4">4. What deserves to be here reckoned a reflec∣tion from Christ the <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> and what belongs to the character we are considering, view∣ing him as a <HI>father:</HI> He was a great lover of <HI>li∣berty</HI> as a kind benevolent <HI>father:</HI> though in a publick station; yet he would have all as children free, not as slaves; all tyranny, either in church or state, was an abomination unto him. He was for that true <HI>liberty;</HI> which is, <HI>liberty</HI> without licentious∣ness;
<PB N="20" REF="012713_0020_0F8B8D944AB0F428"/>that <HI>liberty</HI> to which we are called, which is a <HI>liberty</HI> to do good, not to do hurt; not <HI>liberty</HI> for a cloak of maliciousness; but <HI>in love to serve one another,</HI> as it is expressed Gal. 5.13. He did not appear to have any inclination to have any <HI>liberty</HI> to himself, but what he was sincerely willing o∣thers should enjoy the same in common with him. So generous a soul had he, that it was not enough for him to enjoy freedom alone; but he appeared to have a special happiness and satisfaction in others enjoying the same he did himself. The freedom and order of our civil and religious constitution, was very greatly at heart with him.</P>
<P>To say in a word, and to conclude the character of our departed friend; he was one, that many of the beatitudes may with strictness and propriety be predicated of, Meek, merciful, a peace-maker, of whom it is declared, by him that has the disposal of all things, that such shall <HI>inherit the earth, ob∣tain mercy,</HI> and be called the children of God. Thus we have attended to some imperfect hints of the character of him who was dear to us: and therein have viewed our father when he is taken away from us; we should be careful that we sted∣fastly behold him in his examples, wherein he followed Christ, that so we may obtain a double portion of his spirit. We may now attend to some particular address to the mourners. And first to her, who has received the deepest wound by this fore stroke of divine providence, the sorrowful widow. We heartily condole you, when we enter that house, where we used to find our fa∣ther, our friend, our dear brother and companion: what heaviness and grief does it work in us that there we see him no more! And how much more
<PB N="21" REF="012713_0021_0F8B8D9501914A78"/>this must constantly attend you, we can faintly imagin, though not fully conceive! We know he was most near to you; when he sustained, not only all the relations to you ward, that he did to us: but that most near relation of a kind husband; the desire of your eyes, the companion and part∣ner of all your joys; as well as sustained your griefs and burdens. But now you are left alone to bear a manifold burden of grief; and we would wil∣lingly take a part of your grief, and bear it for you. But this we grieve, that it is out of our power: cast thy burdens upon the Lord and he shall sustain them: you must seek to God for com∣fort and consolation, and put your trust in him, who is the God and husband of the widow, and seek for all your consolation there; and may God grant you all comfort and happiness, that is most proper for you while here; and bring you at last to the full fruition of himself, in the world to come.</P>
<P>I must now address myself to the beloved church and congregation of this place.—You, beloved, I trust are more sensible what a great loss you have sustained, than I can describe to you in words. As a faithful and prudent pastor, he was most near to you; as a kind father and un∣dissembled friend, I claim a share with you: here should be our comfort, that when father, and even were it a mother too forsake us, the Lord will take us up, if we trust in him. Psal. 27.10. This should be our hope, that although our <HI>father,</HI> and the chariots and horsmen of Israel, are re∣moved from us; yet God is a father to them that put their trust in him; and he is the Lord of hosts; he is the shepherd of his people; and if he brings
<PB N="22" REF="012713_0022_0F8B8D9655F85FD8"/>us nearer to him, and a more filial dependence up∣on him, then it will do us good; and as our dear friend we hope is a gainer by death, so we shall be gainers by it too. But we feel such a loss, that tho' for him to depart and be with Christ is better for him; yet for us (it seems) it would have been much better, if he might have abode with us. And therefore we can't but cry out with <HI>Elisha</HI> in our text, <HI>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof.</HI> What a great loss is here; to lose such a stind father, and the defensive force of the people!</P>
<P>Beloved, let us take up the mantle of his faith and good examples which he has left us; and so wear it, as that we may appear to be in very deed his sons in all things, wherein he followed Jesus Christ, and as a noble star reflected light from the <HI>Sun of righteousness;</HI> and carry it with us to the <HI>Jor∣dan</HI> of death, to smite the waters thereof, hither, and thither, that we may pass over without any harm or fear of evil.</P>
<P>And my earnest prayer is, that you may find an <HI>Elisha</HI> to succeed, that shall behold your ascended father <HI>Elijah;</HI> and wearing his mantle of paternal bounty, as well as of faith and good examples, may lead you by the hand, and ever maintain in you a filial affection toward him, whose memory deserves forever to be precious with you even from generation to generation.</P>
<P>And, that you may be led and conducted to such an one, accept a few hints of advice from one, who sincerely wishes your welfare, and ear∣nestly prays, that in due time you may have one, that shall fill up the place of your dear deceased pastor.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="012713_0023_0F8B8D96C3FF50C0"/>
You are sensible, that you must look and seek to Him, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift; Him who received gifts, and who has set in his church such great and important gifts and members. Have your eyes and hearts ear∣nestly to him, who alone can give pastors after his own heart. And, in your choice or election, seek not a blazing star, who makes a great shew, and is soon out of sight, by towering in some high flights of learning or disputes, which may prove no more edification to you, than if he spake in an unknown tongue; and most likely if you keep sight of him, will soon discern him directly in a contrary course, from what he but a little before went.</P>
<P>Neither set your hearts on one already in the me∣ridian, which may soon set and fail you: but rather fix upon one that is just rising, which advances with uniform order and lustre, kindly reflecting light from the <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> in simplicity and godly sincerity; or gently distilling doctrine as the dew, and as the small rain upon the tender herb; so as that every spire or tender leaf shall have a portion and refreshment. Not like a sweeping rain that leaves no food, that smothers the low plants, and beats down the grass and ten∣der herb.</P>
<P>Make it a special point, that you chuse a man of honesty, modesty, meckness; or you may be sure he will never wear the mantle of your late departed <HI>Elijah;</HI> not one that looks upon himself of great and extraordinary importance; but one that is meek and lowly of heart, or he will never reflect light from the <HI>Sun of righteousness;</HI> but will think to lead you by the light of sparks of his
<PB N="24" REF="012713_0024_0F8B8D98ED641A18"/>own kindling. And, that you may have all the blessings of one, who shall be a faithful pastor, a wise guide, an able instructor, a prudent ruler in the house of God, a kind and affectionate father, a loving and beloved brother, an honest man, a sincere christian, an undissembled friend, are the sincere wishes and earnest prayers of him, who has no self interest to serve thereby, but only that he may have the same satisfaction and social comfort in him, that he has had in your dear deceased pas∣tor. And beloved, <HI>see that ye fall not out by the way;</HI> but be at peace among yourselves.</P>
<P>We shall now close up with some few words of general <HI>Application</HI> and exhortation, how to con∣sider and improve our great loss. What gloomy thoughts does it raise in us, when we consider, we shall hear his pleasant voice no more? Should we not mourn for our selves? We do not mourn for him, so long as we trust he is a gainer by the change; since he now rests from his labours, and his works do follow him: he has changed a world of trouble, perplexity and grief for an eternal fix∣ed state of (we charitably hope) rest, joy and hap∣piness; where all sorrow and sighing are fled a∣way; where faith is swallowed up in vision; and hope in fruition; where there is the full enjoy∣ment of God and Jesus Christ. Thus we hope our departed friend is triumphing in the realms of uninterrupted bliss and and happiness; and it remains for us to mourn, that we have lost such a father, such a friend, such a dear companion; to bewail the sinfulness of our state, whereby death has taken place and none are suffered to continue by reason thereof. Even the best, the most valu∣able, all must go sooner or later. <HI>The fathers
<PB N="25" REF="012713_0025_0F8B8D99924B22D0"/>where are they; and the prophets, do they live for∣ever?</HI> Even the high priest <HI>Aaron</HI> himself was not suffered to continue by reason of death: <HI>Elijah</HI> who was a man of such eminent worth; must not remain, though he was indeed exempted from death, yet he must go: <HI>Abraham</HI> the friend of God, and <HI>David</HI> the man after God's own heart must die, must like down and sleep in the earth. What doleful havock sin has made of mankind! None escape the dire effects of it. Hence then we should learn to mourn for sin, to dread and hate it, when this is the cause of our being separated from our friends, their being distrained from us by death. What a vile mons∣ter is sin! it makes us need good friends more; and yet scarce have we opportunity to enjoy them before it some how parts us. What can there be that should more be the object of our hatred and in∣dignation? Again, from what we have heard in the consideration of our great loss; we should study to live so as to be ready to follow after, that we might live Christ, so as that when we come to die it may be our gain. We should, in viewing our great loss, keep our eye upon him, and imitate him in all that, wherein he followed the Lord Je∣sus Christ in patience, in meekness, in love, in mercy, in uprightness, in honesty, covet earnestly the best gifts. To what purpose will it be, to reckon up the greatness of our loss, if it be not to strive after the like in ourselves?</P>
<P>And here as we considered our great friend was eminently as a regular star moving uniform in the orb God had placed him; alas! this star is now set, gone out of our hemisphere! But we have taken a
<PB N="26" REF="012713_0026_0F8B8D9BB894D148"/>view of its course; let us walk by the same course, every one moving regularly &amp; stedfastly in our orbs; not like blazing stars or meteors sometimes passing one way and then the reverse, sometimes this way and sometimes that way. This leads to confusion; but move steadily in the orb, and motion God has allotted out for us; study what is duty, what is the mind and will of God, what he points out for us to do, by his word and by his providences; and attend conscienciously thereto. This is the way to honor God, and to have the comfortable evi∣dences of being accepted of him; for them that honor him he will honor. In vain is it to aspire after great things, and things out of our sphere; it will be of no avail to have it to brag of at last, that we have cast out devils in Christ's name; and in his name done many wonderful works, if there be not charity, love and a consciencious regard to the honor of God, a tender fellow-feeling toward the flock of Christ, the children of God, the mem∣bers of Christ's body, all will be in vain. Thus we should walk, with a steady perseverance in duty, minding those things which have a tendency to do good. Our father which we have now lost, maintained a steady course in doing good, in love, meekness and honesty. If all would do so; move regularly in their spheres; what a different face would there be upon things? How happy might the world be to what it is now: surely all conten∣tion and jarring must cease; all would be love and harmony. But it must needs be that offences come; yet wo to that man by whom they come; while blessed are the peace makers; for they shall be called the children of God. And those, that heartily love and delight in peace and truth here,
<PB N="27" REF="012713_0027_0F8B8D9BDC96E0D0"/>have a happy encouragement of enjoying of it to all eternity. But what can the unjust, the disho∣nest, the malicious, the haughty do in heaven? There will be no room for the exercising their ungodly tempers there.</P>
<P>Hence all should be exhorted to live and be∣have so here, as the heavenly inhabitants do. And how great a thing that would be, to live as they do in heaven! In love, uprightness and godly sincerity.</P>
<P>Finally, at least one more consideration demands our notice at this time; for when great and im∣portant pillars are taken away, the whole build∣ing trembles, and is exposed to tumble to ruin.</P>
<P>Surely the removal of so great a pillar is fore∣boding of the vengeance of God being poured out upon us; when the righteous and the merciful man is taken from the evil to come, Isa. 57.1. 2.</P>
<P>Thus, in the old world, no sooner was <HI>Methuse∣lab</HI> gone than the deluge swept away the ungod∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Thus no sooner had <HI>Lot</HI> left <HI>So∣dom;</HI> but they were destroyed by fire and brim∣stone. No sooner was <HI>Josiah</HI> secured in his grave; but the captivity began, which finished the Jewish state. O then let us consider, how shall these threatning aspects be averted? but by an effec∣tual turning unto God, and becoming stedfast in those things, wherein our friend and father was eminent, lovely and excellent. Beloved, let all these considerations awaken us. Let the sense of our great loss, make a great impression on our
<PB N="28" REF="012713_0028_0F8B8D9CAB4DE830"/>hearts, a great change in our conduct, and so a great alteration in the face of things. And may God of his infinite mercy help, now the godly man ceaseth, and the faithful fail from among the children of men.</P>
