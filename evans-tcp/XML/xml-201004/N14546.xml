<HEAD>To the Free and Independant Citi∣zens of the United States of North-America.</HEAD>
<P>THE happy period being arrived, in which we may in peace, take a review of the scenes, through which we have passed, and with calmness and impartiality exam∣ine and judge of past transactions, encourages me to come forward, and to address you, on a subject of infinite im∣portance to myself, and of so much to you, as to excuse me, from the making any previous-apology, on the occa∣sion.—Perhaps I ought rather to make one, for my hav∣ing been so long silent, under the many heavy charges, brought against me, in the public papers, in America.— Neither a want of sufficient proofs, to refute them, or any indifference, as to the opinion of my countrymen, occa∣sioned my silence, but the reflection, that during the rage, and violence of war, and while party prejudices, heats and jealousies, were in their full force, it was by no means the time for a cool, and dispassionate discussion, of any subject, on which, appearances had already prejudiced the minds of the public.</P>
<P>I resolved to improve the first moment, of public peace, and tranquility, to appear, and to plead my cause, at your bar; during near three years of misfortunes, and exile, I have impatiently looked for it; I now flatter myself, that it is arrived, and in that confidence, venture to call your attention to my case.</P>
<P>It is of some importance, to you, to know, if one, who formerly had your confidence, to a great degree, actually betrayed, and deserted you, and was guilty of the frauds, peculation, and treachery, with which he has been charged, or if artful, and designing men, inimical to him, have tak∣en the advantage of his weakness, or imprudence, to charge him with those enormous crimes; to excite a general clamour against him, and from his silence, to infer in the strongest manner, his guilt.—Though I may solicit your examination, of the subject, at this time, under very great dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dventages, yet I am by no means thereby deterred, from
<PB N="4" REF="018438_0003_0FA76A155967F7A0"/>doing it; as yet, you have heard but one side of the ques∣tion, and that at a time, when your situation, made you justly apprehensive, and jealous of danger, from every quarter, and rendered you, as it were, feelingly alive in every pore; at present, when we are happily freed, from the alarms, and dangers of war, you will not refuse, to hear the other part, and thereby become capable, of judging on the whole, with certainty, and with justice, to the accusers, as well as to the accused; which is all I ask, or wish for—unwilling to take up more of your time, than is absolutely necessary, I shall not in this address, recapitu∣late the many surmises, and insinuations, thrown out against me, by my enemies, in the course of their persecutions of me, but confine myself, to the direct charges against me, which are all of them, comprehended under two heads:</P>
<P>First, that I was guilty of fraud, and peculation, in the management, of the public monies, committed to my care; and secondly, that after my return to France, in 1781, I wrote those letters, which were intercepted, and published in New-York, from interested motives, and with the base and treacherous design, to injure my country; having en∣gaged myself in the interest of her enemies.</P>
<P>If on an impartial examination of facts, you shall judge me guilty, of these crimes, nothing that has hitherto been said, or done against me, will be deemed unjust, or too se∣vere; but if on the other hand, you shall, from the most unquestionable facts, and circumstances, find those charges, to be false, and groundless, whatever weakness, or impru∣dence, you may find me justly chargeable with, you will at least, acquit me of any thing criminal, and pronounce me to be <HI>"A man more sinned against, than sining."</HI></P>
<P>My conduct in the early part, of the late contest, and until my leaving America, in April 1776, to go for France, in the character of Commercial, and Political Agent, and Commissioner for the United States, is too well known, to require my referring to any part of it.—The charges against me, originate after that period; previous to it, I had no charge of public monies. I arrived in France, in June 1776, and acted as sole Commercial, and Political Agent, for the United States until the month of December following, when I received a commission, from Congress, appointing Doctor Franklin, Mr. Lee, and myself, their joint Com∣missioners
<PB N="5" REF="018438_0004_0FA76A16285CEA90"/>Plenipotentiary, and I continued to act, in this character, until the first of April 1778, when in obedience to the orders of Congress, I left Paris, on my return to America, and from that period, to the present hour, have not been entrusted with the monies of the public, or with any public employ whatever; it therefore follows, that if frauds, peculation, and embezzlements, were practised, and committed by me, they must have been in, and during that period, that is between April 1776, and April 1778, —and that I must have committed them, in my transac∣tions at Paris, where I constantly resided; the time and place being ascertained, the justice or injustice of this charge, will at once be seen, by an examination, of my re∣ceipts, and disbursements of public monies.—On the 4th of March 1778, I received a positive order, from Congress, to return immediately to America, to acquaint them, with the state of their affairs, in Europe; in the resolution of Congress transmitted and in the letter accompanying of it, to me, this appeared to be, the only motive, and object of my recall.—Though the treaties with France, had been concluded, and signed on the sixth of February preceding, yet they had still been kept secret, and by agreement with the Court of France, were not to be made public, in Eu∣rope, until intelligence should be received, of their being arrived, and published, in America; But several circum∣stances, concur'd at that time, to induce the Court of France, to change their plan, and publicly to announce, to the Court of London, their having entered into Trea∣ties of Commerce, and Alliance, with the United States, and to dispatch, with all possible secrecy, and expedition, the fleet then at Toulon, to America, under the command of the Count D'Estaing; and the Count D'Vergennes, and Dr. Franklin, joined, in advising me, to keep my re∣call, and my intention to return, secret, until the fleet should sail, in which it was proposed, that I should em∣bark.</P>
<P>At this time, most of the contracts, for stores, arms, cloathing, &amp;c. and for ships to transport them to Ameri∣ca, were compleated; the execution of those contracts, had been principally under my direction, but though monies had been advanced, on all of them, the accompts of the contractors, had not been brought in for settlement,
<PB N="6" REF="018438_0005_0FA76A184E84A8D8"/>and it was impossible for me, if I literally complied with the order of Congress, and with the urgent request, of the French Minister, and of Doctor Franklin, to go out in the fleet; to do any thing previously, towards the calling in, and settling the public, or even my private accompts; any attempt that way, would have defeated the secrecy, and dispatch enjoined me—though nothing appeared in the order of Congress, or in any of their letters, which intimated, the least dissatisfaction, with my conduct, or any suspicion of the faithful management, and applica∣tion, of the public monies, yet as I had from the first, the misfortune, to have in Mr. Lee, one of my Colleagues, a most jealous, and artful enemy, and sensible, that many ill offices, had been done me in America, I was extreme∣ly desirous, to put off my return until all the transactions in which I had had, any concern for the public, should be settled, and closed, but finally, I submitted to the advice of Count D'Vergennes, and of Dr. Franklin, and con∣tented myself, with taking from Mr. Grand, the Banker for Congress, an accompt of all the monies, received, or paid out, on accompt of Congress, up to that time, this was all that was in my power to do, and as Mr. Grand, had mentioned in his accompt, the names of the persons, to whom he had paid money, and as I carried out with me, the most honourable testimonials, from his Majesty, from his Minister, and from my colleague, and intimate friend Dr. Franklin, of my zeal, and integrity in the ser∣vice of my country, I had no reason to apprehend, the be∣ing censured, for not having settled, and brought out with me, all the public accompts, and their vouchers, in detail; but on my arrival in Philadelphia, I soon sound, that my enemies, had been, to a certain degree, successful, in poi∣soning the minds of the public by insinuating, that I had become immensely rich, in the service of the public, and consequently that I must have been guilty of undue, and dishonest practices; and though I had been sent for ex∣pressly, to inform Congress, of the state of their affairs, in Europe, and notwithstanding the honourable character, I had sustained, as their Political, and Commercial Agent in Europe, and afterwards as one of their Commissioners Plenipotentiary, I could not obtain an audience, of that body, until after six weeks attendance, and solicitation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="018438_0006_0FA76A19310BE0B0"/>
I then gave them verbally, a faithful detail, of the state of their affairs, in Europe, and laid before them, Mr. Grands accompt of the receipts, and payments of monies, to the time of my leaving Paris; and requested, that if their had been, any charge or insinuation against me, for mismanagement, or neglect, that I might be informed of it, and be permitted to be heard, in my defence.</P>
<P>I was not told of any, and though Congress appeared no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way dissatisfied, with the account, I then gave them, of the state of their affairs, in Europe, and of my own con∣duct, in their service, and though the settlement of the public, as well as of my private accompts, pressed me to return as early as possible, to France, yet I could not ob∣tain any resolution, of Congress, either to approve, or to disapprove, of any part of my conduct, and though I al∣most daily solicited, for a second audience, I did not ob∣tain one, until late in December following.</P>
<P>I then gave them a written narrative of my transactions, from my leaving America in their service, until my recall and return,—Congress then appeared disposed, to take the matter up, and to examine it, and to come to some determination, on the subject, a Committee was appointed to examine the state of their foreign affairs, and into the conduct of their Commissioners, and Agents, and for greater dispatch, the Committee were ordered, to meet every evening, Saturday and Sunday evenings excepted; yet that Committee never condescended to admit me to an audience, or to ask me a single question, on the sub∣ject of their enquiry.—And though I had been sent for expressly, to inform Congress, of the state of their affairs in Europe, yet their Committee, studiously evaded, the giving me an opportunity of laying before them, any in∣formation on the subject, or of explaining any part of my own conduct, while in their service.</P>
<P>During more than fourteen months attendance in Phila∣delphia, I obtained but two audiences from Congress, and none from their Committee, whose proceeding, and report, if indeed they made any, were kept secret from me,—In December 1778, having waited five months in Philadel∣phia, almost daily soliciting Congress to examine my transactions, while in their service, I found that a party determined, on my ruin, had sufficient interest, to prevent
<PB N="8" REF="018438_0007_0FA76A52C645B680"/>all examination, and to bear me down, by the most mor∣tifying delay, and neglect; I therefore resolved to lay my case, before 'my countrymen, and fellow-citizens, but on my first address to them, Congress resolved to give me an audience, and afterward appointed a Committee, as I have before mentioned.</P>
<P>As I flattered myself, that Congress had resolved, to examine, into the state of foreign affairs, and of those transactions, in which I had been a principal actor, and to come to some determination, on the subject, I could not consider myself at liberty, to proceed in publishing the state of my case; in the mean time I was attacked and a∣bused, in the most base and outrageous manner, in the public papers,—I made no reply to the many calumnies, and falsehoods, published by a noted s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribler, his associates and patrons, but earnestly requested, of Congress, and of their Committee, to grant me a hearing, and to do me justice;—but my solicitations were ineffectual, though from December 1778, to August 1779, I wrote more than thirty letters to Congress, humbly petitioning for a public examination, and tryal, yet they never condescended, to take the least notice of my requests:—In private conver∣sation with the members I was told, that the only difficul∣ty lay in my accompts, not being settled; to obviate this, I returned to France, on assurances from Congress, that they had appointed, and impowered a gentleman in France, to audit, and settle all their public accompts; but on my arri∣val in France, in July 1780, and application to him, I found that his power, was so limited, that be declined, acting under it.—I wrote immediately to Congress, solicit∣ing for more ample powers to him, or to some other per∣son, and set myself to put, not only my accompts, but those of my colleagues, and of every one, with whom I had transacted any business, on account of the public, in a state for being audited, and settled; and I passed more than twelve months, at Paris, at a heavy expence, flatter∣ing myself, that as Congress had made no objection, what∣ever, to any part of my conduct, in their service, except my not having settled my accompts, and as my enemies, both in Congress, and out of it, professed to believe, that I was a defaulter, they would not, after the prodigious ex∣pence, of time, and money, which I had been put to, de∣lay
<PB N="9" REF="018438_0008_0FA76A538C902BD8"/>the appointment of an auditor, to examine my ac∣compts, and to ascertain the only point in question, with regard to me; but I heard nothing on the subject, until November 1781, when I received a resolve of Congress, informing me, that by the appointment of a Consul, pro∣vision was made, for the settlement of my accompts; but in a few days after, I met with Mr. Barclay the Consul, who to my extreme surprise, and disappointment, assured me that he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no instructions on the subject; and a few days after, I had the mortification, of learning, that my letters of May, and June preceding, had beed intercepted, and published in New-York, and that the most unfavour∣able construction, had been put on them, both in America, and in France.</P>
<P>This placed me in a situation, in which I believe, but few men, have ever been so unfortunate, as to fall into.</P>
<P>Proscribed in my own country, and in France, and ob∣noxions to the government of this country, I submitted to a tedious exile, in Flanders, where I remained, until the treaty of peace, was concluded, but in the mean time, I transmitted my accompts to Congress, and solicited a set∣tlement, and the payment of the ballance due to me; I also sent duplicates of them to Dr. Franklin, and to Mr. Barclay.</P>
<P>It is now more than eighteen months, since Congress have been in possession of my accompts, it is more than five years, since I had either the money, or any employ∣ment for the public entrusted to my management.</P>
<P>Is it possible that any fraud or embezzlement commit∣ted by me, should still remain undetected? Had I been guilty of any, would not my enemies with all the parti∣culars of my accounts in their power, have pointed them out, and published them instead of charging me general∣ly with being a defaulter for unaccounted millions?—In March 1778, Doctor Frankling assured Congress that he had been an eye witness of my conduct in France, while his colleague, and that I had acted the part of an able, ac∣tive, and fathful minister, and to his knowledge had in various ways rendered great and important services to my county

<P>MY colleague Mr. Deane being recalled by Congress, and no reasons given, that have yet appeared here, it is apprehended to be the effect of some misrepresentation from an enemy or two at Paris, and at Nantz.—I have no doubt, that he will be able clearly to justify himself, but having lived intimately with him, now fifteen months, the greatest part of the time in the same house, and been a constant witness of his public conduct;—I cannot omit giving this testimony, though unasked, in his behalf, that I esteem him, a faithful, active, and able Minister, who to my knowledge, has done in various ways▪ great and important services to his country, whose interests I wish may always be by every one in her employ, as much, and as effectually promoted.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE>.—To charge me with being a defaulter, and with having desra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed my country, of large sums of money, and at the same time, to evade an examination, and settle∣ment of my accompts, by which only the justice, or in∣justice, of the charge, could be ascertained, is a conduct, which needs no comment, nor do I fear to rest my cause on it, and on the testimony, and certificate, of Dr. Frank∣lin,
<PB N="11" REF="018438_0010_0FA76A5501E6D8D0"/>but clear, and convincing as these proofs are, of my innocence, I have a sufficiency of others, independent of the testimony or certificate of any man, or of the conduct of any set of men, whether friendly or inimical to me.— In January 1776, I contracted with the Commercial Com∣mittee, of Congress, to make a voyage to France, and to purchase for the public, goods to the amount of forty thousand pounds sterling,—they engaged to furnish me with that sum in cash, or good bills, and to allow me a five per cent. commission, on the purchase—At the same time the secret Committee, appointed me the Commer∣cial, and Political Agent, for the United States in Europe, and directed me to purchase for them, 100 pieces of brass cannon, and arms, and cloathing, for 25,000 men, and ammunition in proportion, and to procure ships, in Eu∣rope, to transport the whole to America; on these pur∣chases, they also stipulated, to give me five per cent. com∣mission, and to make me a reasonble, and adequate allow∣ance, for any political services, which I might render my country in France.—When we reflect on the situation of our affairs, at that period, it must be acknowledged, that no man was ever charged, with a more important Com∣mission, and when the circumstances of my being igno∣rant of the language, as well as of the manners, and politics of the country, in which I was to execute it, without friend, or patron to advise, to countenance, or to introduce me, and without that best of all patrons, and supporters, a fund adequate to the purpose; when these are taken into consideration, it must also be allowed, that no Commis∣sion of this nature was ever attended with more difficulties and embarrassments.</P>
<P>I left Philadelphia in the month of March 1776, in a brigantine bound to Bordeaux, and such was the situation of our affairs at that time, that she sailed with ballast only, for the want of any thing, to make remittances with in a cargo;—an accident at sea, obliged her to return, and I re-embarked in a sloop, bound to Bermuda, and the whole of the funds, put into my hands to enable me to make the purchases, above mentioned, amounted to 2375<ABBR>l.</ABBR> ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ling in bills of exchange, and an order, to receive the pro∣ceeds of a cargo, in the sloop, consigned to Mr. Pucker, at Bermuda.—The secret Committee, gave me a bill of

<P>Having on my arrival in France deposited in the hands of Mr. Delap, the whole of the effects brought out with me, and having never received any monies on account of Congress, from my engaging in their service to the pre∣sent time, but from the persons above mentioned; it is easy to ascertain if I received more than the above sum on my private account, or for my immediate disbursements for the public. I know of no question that can arise on this subject, except it be on account of the overcharge made against me by Mr. Soulier, which I have explained in my account, and letters before Congress, and referred to Mr. R. Morris to justify my explanation.</P>
<P>Though the funds which I put into Mr. Delap's hands in June 1776, amounted to livres, 73870,14,11. and he received some remittances from Messrs. Livingston, Lew∣is, Alsop, and Morris, over what he paid out on their ac∣count; yet his disbursements on account of Congress, and the sums which I drew on him for on the same ac∣count: So far exceeded the whole, that in December he refused my bills, and on the 31st wrote me as follows: <Q>Time only permits us to inform you, that we have re∣ceived a letter from A. Nesbitt, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of London, re∣turning us protested, 1200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling; David White's bill of 20th of April, at 30 days sight on Serjeant Cham∣bers and Co. 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling; of Margaret Livingston's of 28th May, at 30 days sight, on S. Baker, £ .570 9 sterling; of Ringhold and Hennesly, of the 8th of No∣vember 1775, on Serjeant Chambers and Co. so that the last remittances made us by Messrs. Livingston, Lewis and Alsop, and by Messrs. Willing and Morris,
<PB N="14" REF="018438_0013_0FA76A5742D32118"/>has been all prohibited except two small bills making together 230<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling. Messrs. Livingston, Lewis, and Alsop since remitted us for your account, 800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling in D. Shinger's bill of the 20th of August, at 30 days sight on Ford, Courtoys and Co. of Barcelona, which is likewise returned to us protested. We are sorry for all these disappointments; but in the present situation of affairs, we look on bills as no remittance, for scarce one in ten of them is paid. The bills you forwarded us for acceptance must be returned, or lie by until funds arrive, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I will not take up the time of the public, by attempting to describe the distressed situation in which I found my∣self at that period,—The whole of my scanty funds ex∣pended, and indebt to near ten thousand pounds sterling on account of Congress, for which I had given bills in my private name, and which were refused by the House on which I was directed to value myself, and through whom remittances were to be made to me, nor the advantages at that time taken of our embarrassments to force us into a contract with the Farmers General for a quantity of to∣bacco, to be delivered to them in France at little more than the one half of its then current price.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the Commissioners obtained one million of livres to be advanced them by the Farmers Ge∣neral on these hard terms, and about the same time two millions from the Court, to be paid quarterly in the course of the year 1777. At some future time, I shall en∣ter mutually on the history of our situation at that peri∣od, and of the whole of the negociation in France from my arrival in 1776 to the signing of the treaties of Paris in 1778, and to my recall. At present it is sufficient to observe, that the money then received and promised, gave me as well as my colleagues a temporary relief—that the whole of it was paid into the hands of Mr. Grand, whose account now more than five years since laid before Con∣gress, will shew to whom and to whose orders he repaid it. But if I received of him, as appears from his account, the above sum of livres 69253 7 6, and of the others in the whole, with that sum, livres 148045 16 5, only somewhat less than seven thousand pounds; what must or can be said of those, who for four years since have been
<PB N="15" REF="018438_0014_0FA76A5A10410E78"/>charging me in all your public papers, with being a de∣faulter for unaccounted millions? They could not have been ignorant of the state of the public account so far as I was interested in them, they were on the files of Con∣gress in America, and in the bands of Doctor Franklin in France, open for the inspection of every one, whose in∣terest or curiosity might-excite them to an examination. But what were my disbursements during this term of more than two years on account of the public, and for my time and expences? My account before Congress shew that they amounted to a much larger sum than that which I had received, including my time and expences to Ame∣rica, and during my attendance on Congress, and for my return to France, they amounted to livres 258,164 9 2, or, livres 110,118 12 9 more than I had received, leav∣ing me a creditor for that sum, equal to £ .4817 18 7½ sterling. Mr. Arthur Lee in a letter to Congress of the 1st of June 1778, says, <Q><HI>I find that the expence of living in character, cannot well be less than three thousand pounds sterling a year;</HI></Q> and adds, <Q><HI>if left to themselves, I con∣ceive that most persons will e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceed that sum,</HI></Q> that is, livres 68571 per annum. I was as Mr. Lee expresses it, left to myself; yet from my leaving America in 1776, until my leaving Paris to return to it in 1778, I have not charged but about eighty thousand livres for all my ex∣pences of every kind; the remainder of the liv. 258,164 9 2 was for disbursements on account of Congress, and for my time and subsequent expences, the particulars of which are in my account before Congress.</P>
<P>Mr. William Lee made one journey to Vienna on ac∣count of the public, and Mr. Izard who was at Paris for the education of his children, received while there a com∣mission from Congress to the Court of Tuscany, but ne∣ver went out of Paris, or quitted his family on the busi∣ness of the public. The former of these gentlemen re∣ceived seventy-two thousand livres, and the latter sixty thousand for their private expences; yet these men are among the loudest against me for an extravagant waste of public money.</P>
<P>And permit me here my countrymen and fellow citi∣zens, to request of you, that you will examine for your∣selves, or that if your distance from Philadelphia will not
<PB N="16" REF="018438_0015_0FA76A5B50CC6270"/>permit you to do it, that you will demand of your Dele∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in Congress, an account of all the monies ever re∣mitted to me by Congress, and of all that ever I received on their account,—by this you will be able to form a judg∣ment with sufficient precision, if I am a defaulter for mil∣lions or one of the public creditors. But exclusive of the above ballance due to me, after accounting for all the mo∣nies received by me, I am entitled to a commission of five per cent on goods and military stores purchased by me, agreeable to orders received from Congress to the amount of livres 4756,393 17, which makes the sum of £ .238,445 0 7, including expence of postage. These goods and military stores I purchased previous to the arrival of my colleagues, in consequence of the orders given me by the secret Committee of Congress, and on which I was promised the same commission as was then given to other agents and purchasers, which was uniformly five per cent; for the purchases made jointly with my colleagues, I have not charged any thing, being then in a different capacity, as joint Commissioner Plenipotentiary with them. Thus it appears that instead of being a defaulter, I am a credi∣tor of the public's, and to a large amount; and of all the public creditors, perhaps no one has suffered so much in point of interest, certainly no one so much in point of character.</P>
<P>But of this, I shall take notice on a future occasion. I need not take up any more of your time at present on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subject of my accounts, they have long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce been before Congress, and to them I appeal to justify the general state which I have given of my money transactions for the pub∣lic. I have shewn, and it will appear from them, that from my arrival in France in June 1776, to the Decem∣ber following, when joined by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee, I had had no money or next to none of the public's at any time in my hands; but on the contrary, was at that time in advance for my employers, and that afterwards until my return to America, I did not receive a sum any way equal to my expences and disbursements; and from that period to the present I have not had any public employ, or public money committed to my management. The se∣cond charge against me, is, on account of my having in May and June 1781, wrote my opinion of our public af∣fairs
<PB N="17" REF="018438_0016_0FA76A5BC98E59A0"/>to my friends in America, and advised peace and an accommodation with Great-Britain. I confess that the letters published by Rivington in New-York, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mine, do not materially differ from those which I actually wrote at that time, and which unfortunately for me were inter∣cepted by the enemy, and that they contain the undis∣guised sentiments of my heart at that time, on the then apparent situation of our affairs; but I never yet heard of its being deemed a crime in a free state, for its citizens to give their opinion and advice on public affairs and measures. To suppose me to have been in the interest of the Ministers of this country, and to have wrote those letters to promote their views, is as absurd as to suppose, that I amassed an immense fortune in the service of my country; yet although my well known circumstances and connections at that period, and previous to it, as well as since, demonstrate the absurdity and falshood of such a supposition; yet both the one and the other have been not only supposed, but positively asserted by certain wri∣ters in America, who stick at nothing however extrava∣gant.</P>
<P>I can hardly imagine, notwithstanding the late and pre∣sent prosperous state of our affairs, that any one can have forgot the situation in which they were in 1781, when I wrote those letters, and previous to the surrender of Lord Cornwallis and his army at York. In May and in June 1781, the British forces were in the possession of the whole of our sea coast, from the Cheesapeak southward, and while they ravaged and distressed the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or country, their ships of war and cruisers intercepted almost the whole of our trade and of our supplies; we had no naval force to oppose to theirs, nor any probability at that time of our ally sending to our assistance, a naval force superior to that of the enemy. The army under General Wash∣ington was too weak of itself for any offensive opera∣tions, and Congress had neither money or credit sufficient to put it on a more respectable footing. General Washing∣ton did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scruple at that period to declare, <Q>That with∣out a decidedly superior fleet to that of Great-Britain in America, all opposition to the British force in Ame∣rica would soon be at an end.</Q> All the letters from America were in the same stile; many circumstances, as the time, my own observations and the information I was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="18" REF="018438_0017_0FA76A5D6840BFA0"/>in the way of, led me to conclude, that there was not the least probability of there being a French fleet on our coast that campaign superior to the British. Accidents and circumstances unforeseen at that time, and those extreme∣ly improbable ones, joined to a neglect or breach of or∣ders on the part of the British, gave the French sleet that superiority, which alone decided the fate of Lord Corn∣wallis and of his army at York; had not this event hap∣pened, of which when I wrote there was not the most distant probability, the war must have terminated against us in that campaign. In this I was supported by the una∣nimous opinion of the best judges on the subject then in America,—was it a crime in me to write from Europe to America, in the same stile in which our Generals and leading men wrote to their friends in Europe? My let∣ters have been published, their's have not; this is the sole difference, except the cruel circumstance of mine having been published by the enemy, at a time when our danger was over, and when the publication could serve no other pur∣pose, but to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen. At the time of my writing, every thing conspired to con∣vince me, that France had only her own interest and that of Spain in view, in the war, and that however, it might terminate, she would be very far from consulting our in∣terest, in the peace, persuaded of this, I wrote it, to be my opinion, and for this I have been deemed an enemy, and traitor to France, as well as to the United States.</P>
<P>But have not events in part justified this opinion of mine? You best know, by what intrigues, the French Court prevailed with Congress, to order our Commission∣ers, not to sign any treaty with Great-Britain, without the knowledge, and consent of the Court of Ver∣sailles, and thus to put our future peace, liberty, and safe∣ry absolutely into their power—nor can you I presume be ignorant, that the Court of France, having thus bound us, began to take off the mask, and to take measures with, and to propose terms to the other powers, for excluding us, from the fisheries, and for supporting the extravagant claims of Spain to East-Louisiania, and that our Commis∣sioners, alarmed at this, wisely ventured to break the or∣ders, sent them from Congress, and to sign the prelimina∣ry articles, without either the knowledge, or the consent,
<PB N="19" REF="018438_0018_0FA76A5E0F0B9000"/>of the Ministers at Versailles.—Are not these well known facts, abundantly sufficient to justify me, for having in 1781, entertained suspicions, of the sincerity of France, in her professions of disinterested friendship to the United States?—By our treaty with Great-Britain, we are enti∣tled to a right in her share of the Newfoundland, and No∣va-Scotia fisheries, but has not France wholly excluded us, from any in hers?—Does not France, at this time, encourage, and support Spain, in her claims to the richest, and most extensive, part of the territory, allowed by Great-Britain, in the late treaty, to belong to us? These attempts are not marks of friendship, but are the most un∣equivocal characteristics, of that insidious, interested poli∣cy, which I pointed out in my letters, and warned my friends to be on their gaurd against.—In my letter to Mr. Morris, I gave him my opinion, with respect to the su∣ture state of our commerce, under independant sovereign∣ty, and the grounds, on which I was led to form it, and I shall be happy, if experience (which alone can decide in such cases) proves that my opinion, and reasoning on that subject, were erroneous and ill founded.—Apprehensive at the time, and distressed by the thought, that we must ei∣ther fail in the contest, and in such case, submit to the laws of our conquerors, rendered imperious, and severe from their success, or that if successful ourselves, that in the situation, in which our country must be, on the peace, burthened with heavy taxes, on account of the public debts, contracted by the war, and still heavier, for the future support of independant sovereignty, and at the same time, exposed, to the evils arising from internal factions, and divisions, and from our jarring, and incomparible inter∣ests; that our democratic governments, which we had established in Congress, and in our several States, would not be found to have sufficient energy, and coercion, to establish, and maintain such a degree, of order and of due subordination, as must ever be indispensibly necessary, in all governments, to prevent anarchy, and confusion; and that in such a situation, independant sovereignty, instead of proving a blessing, must become the heaviest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fortune, which could befal us;—strongly impressed by this opin∣ion, I judged it to be my duty, to urge, and press my countrymen, by every argument, in my power, to im∣prove
<PB N="20" REF="018438_0019_0FA76A5EC1B5B2C8"/>that important crisis, and by an accommodation, and re-union with Great-Britain, on equal, safe, and honourable terms, to secure our future peace, liberty and safety, both in∣ternal and external; I then thought that are-union, not sim∣ply on the condition of being replaced, in the state, in which we were previous to 1763 (for which alone Con∣gress in 1774, and afterwards in 1775 petitioned) but on conditions, and terms, every way peferable, to those of being governed solely by laws, of our own enacting, of be∣ing taxed only by our Assemblies, and of enjoying the same commercial privileges, and protection, as other sub∣jects of the British empire are, or may be entitled to; I say, that it was then my opinion, that an accommodation, and re-union on those terms, was to be preferred, to a continuation of the war, to running the risque of its un∣certain issue, and to hazarding the dangerous experiment, of independant sovereignty. This opinion of mine, has been deemed a crime in me, little short of that of high treason.— But it ought to be remembered, that this was my opinion, and that I communicated it, to my friends, at a time, when our prospects, were gloomy and discouraging.— But we now enjoy independant sovereignty and peace, on the most favourable and honourable terms, and have ob∣tained every thing, which we either hoped for, or demand∣ed, and happy indeed should I be, were I certain, that none of the evils, which I apprehended in 1781, were ci∣ther felt, or feared by my countrymen, at this time, in such case, I should be contented to be ridiculed or even pitied, for my weak, and gloomy forebodings in 1781.— But General Washington in his circular letter says, that <Q>It is a question yet to be decided, whether the revolu∣tion, must ultimately be considered, as a blessing, or a curse.—A blessing or a curse, not to the present age alone, for with our fate, will the destiny of unborn millions, be involved.</Q>—I ask, that these expressions, of the General, after the great object of independant sove∣reignty, has been obtained, and ratified, and confirmed to us, by treaties, may be compared, with the expressions, in my letters of 1781, on the same subject, and that my countrymen, will then say, if it was a criminal desertion, of the cause of my country, or if it was an unpardonable weakness, and despondency of mind, in me, at that time,
<PB N="21" REF="018438_0020_0FA76A5F85B7F958"/>to make a question of that which now, when success and peace have secured our independant sovereignty, is by Gen. Washington declared to be still a <HI>question undecided</HI> and doubtful, and that not only so as to the present day, but to future ages. If indeed, the small degree of order, of restraint and of subordination, which has for the last seven years prevailed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our country, be now thrown off, and the legislative and executive power once more return in effect, into the hands of Committees and Conventions; if in place of that subordination to law and government, of those decent, frugal, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuous manners and habits, of that ease, and even affluence in which our fellow-citizens, formerly lived, in peace, and safety, in a word, if instead of those manners, principles, and circumstances, which once marked our character, the reverse, should in future take place, and prevail, under a government too weak to prevent, or remedy the evils; there cannot then remain a question, on the subject; but suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>narchy, and confusion, must ensue, as to render our independance, a curse, and the present, and future age, in America, as unhappy, as any ages, to be met with, in the history of civilized na∣tions, have ever been.</P>
<P>The great end of civil society, is to secure to men, unit∣ed in it, the great blessings of peace, of liberty, and safety, both in their persons, and in their property, and in de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id∣ing what form of government, most effectually answere this great, and beneficent purpose, experience, not theory, must direct us.</P>
<P>This is not a subject, for recluse Philosophers, or subtle Metaphysicians, to decide on, in their closets.—And whenever they have been refer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to, they have given the preference, to Utopian, or ideal and imaginary systems of their own, before those plain and simple on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which expe∣rience has shewn, to be practicable and safe.—But with∣out looking abroad, to profit, by the experience of other nations, our own must now, with the utmost precision and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtainty determine, this great question, as yet undecided, and bring conviction home to every one,—either that our present system of government, is preferable, to that under which we and our ancestors, for more than one century and an half were free, safe and happy; or that it is not.— Our situation previous to the late revolution, must be stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>P. S. I have avoided entering on the subject, of the numerous calumnies, which have been propagated against me, by anonymous writers, it would have been endless, and quite unnecessary, since every thing, which has either been said, or sugges<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed against me, may be reduced to two questions only:</P>
<P>First if I acted fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hfully, and was an honest steward, of the public money, while in the service of my country, and secondly, if the contents of my letters, of May and June 1781, were of such a nature, as to merit the harsh censures, passed on me, in America on their account;—in France I
<PB N="23" REF="018438_0022_0FA76A61110744A8"/>can expect no other, than to be condemned, it is what every one must expect to be, who calls in question, the disinterestedness of the motives of France, in the late war, or who attempts to prevent our country, from becoming virtually dependant on that power;—As to the reports, circulated here, and which may probably reach America, of my being at the levees of the Ministers, and in frequent conference, with them, and that I have acted, an un∣friendly part respecting our commerce, and the like, I can with the greatest truth, and sincerity declare, that there is not the least foundation for them, I have not so much as seen, any of the Ministers, since my arrival in this country, nor have I ever had the least connection, or correspondence with any, either of the present, or late Ministers of this country.—And as to our commerce, I gave my opinion in 1781, in my letter to Mr. Morris, as to the restrictions, which I thought it would fall under, on a peace; if any part of what I then apprehended, has been realized, I am not to blame; I most heartily wish, that no part of it may ever be so, but that experience may shew me, to have been in an error, in what I wrote on that subject.</P>

<P>MY address of the 10th of August has lain by me, to this time, although when I wrote that, my inten∣tion was, as I inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated, to follow it, with a second, yet I did not purpose to do it, so soon, but have been advised by some gentlemen, lately from America, to take notice of certain report<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, circulated in the United States, and in this country, respecting me: they tell me that it has been affirmed, and generally believed, in America, that I am rich, and in the most affluent circumstances, from money made in the service of my country; that I received a pen∣sion, to a large amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, from this government; that I was in∣timate with General Arnold, and that I had done every thing, in my power, since my being in England, in prejudice of our commerce, and in particular, that I had assisted, in the writing of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amphlet, entitled, Observations on the A∣merican Commerce, published by Lord Sheffield.—Now in any other circumstances, than those of the present, I need do nothing more, than to declare, that those reports are totally false and groundless, and call on the authors to produce their evidence, if they have any in support of them; but it seems that there are cases, in which a man must be put to prove simple negatives; every news paper report, tending to calumniate one, already unpopular, be∣come of equal authenticity with <HI>proofs from holy wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI>— I have shewn, that I expended and disbursed more money, on account of Cougress, than ever I received from them, most certainly this is not the way, to grow rich, in an em∣ploy, but I might have found means, by secret understand∣ing, with the agents and contractors for the stores sent out to America, to have ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uired a fortune, to myself, true, but the accompts of those agents and contractors, have, one only of them excepted, been examined and passed by Congress, or their auditors.—The only person, who has not had his accompts passed by Congress, has received their unanimous thanks, for his services rendered them, in the supplies sent out by him; the presumption from this, at least is, that Congress could have no doubt of the integrity and fairness, with which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conducted that af∣fair.—Whence
<PB N="25" REF="018438_0024_0FA76A6286E8B510"/>then could I have accumulated a fortune, in the service of my country? It is true, that had Con∣gress paid me, the balance honestly due me, I should have been at ease in my circumstances, for by that means, I should have received, some compensation, for the heavy losses, which I suffered by the depreciation, but this they have not done;—while in the service of Congress, I en∣gaged in two commercial adventures, I was ordered by the secret Committee, to assume, and act the part of a mer∣chant.—But in both of those, I was unfortunate, in one a total loss, by capture; in the other a failure of the man, to whom I had given the direction of it, left me a great looser by it.—It is delicate and even cruel, for a man, who has been in trade and means, if possible, to return in∣to that line, to expose his private circumstances, in point of fortune, otherways I could give the most convincing proof, that of the moderate fortune, of which I was pos∣sessed in 1774, I am not at this time, master of the one half.—I have not at any time been extravagant, when all the funds of Congress in Europe, were open to me, my accompts will shew, that I lived but in a moderate stile.— I was not in a dissipated, or extravagant line of life, while in Philadelphia, waiting the decision, or orders of Con∣gress; on my return to France, I was obliged to borrow money of Dr. Franklin, and of other friends there, for my support; are these marks, or evidence, of my having made a fortune, in the service of the public? Do they not prove the contrary? But my acquiting myself of one charge, may give some weight, some probability to the other, since if thus reduced, and obliged to borrow for my private expences, at that time, I might the more easily, have been tempted, to accept of a pension from this government.—But Minis∣ters, though attentive to their own interest and that of their friends, and liberal of the public monies, on certain occasions, never have such an overflow of it, as to give it away at hazard, or to those, who cannot render them or their cause, some immediate service.—If every man is to be bought, at a certain price, the purchaser will also esti∣mate, the value of the man, he deals for, and not throw away his money, in the purchase of one, who can be of no kind of use to him; Of what use in 1781, could I have been of, to the British, or to any other Minister? I had no
<PB N="26" REF="018438_0025_0FA76A634603CF68"/>public trust or state secrets which I could betray, had I been so disposed.—My popularity and influence, in the United States, had been destroyed, by the calumnies, published against me, in Philadelphia, and by the neglect and in∣gratitude of Congress, I most certainly could offer nothing to the Minister, and he could expect nothing from me, there did not exist, any foundation, for a contract be∣tween us, if my necessities at that time, might have urged me, to seek for relief, from any quarter, or by any means, still the Minister, to whom I must have applied, would not have parted with the public money, solicited and scrambled for, by so many of his friends and supporters, to one, who had been declaredly and openly his enemy, without some prospect, without even a certainty of an equivalent—I had none to offer, none to propose—what circumstance, what action of mine, from my return to France in 1780, to this hour tends to support this charge, of my being in the pay of this government? I never cor∣responded with any one of the Ministers, or their agents, if they really had any in France.—The Honourable Mr. Walpole with whom I contracted, a very intimate ac∣quaintance, soon after my return to Paris, had ever been in the opposition in Parliament, yet in the Philadelphia papers, I see him mentioned, as being the agent, who en∣gaged me in the service of the British Ministers.—But to render this charge even probable, it ought first to be shewn, at least, that after my return to France, I had it in my power to be of some service to this government, and that I actually performed, or attempted to perform some ser∣vice to it, but neither of these, can be shewn, or any thing tending that way.</P>
<P>My letters of 1781, contained no sentiments which I attempted to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nceal in my conversation with my country∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in France; a convincing proof, that however erroni∣ously I might think and reason at that time, yet that I was sincere, and spoke and wrote without disguise or sinis∣ter view. My letters contained my private opinion, at that time, had not every ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izen of the United States a right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o give hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on what so nearly interested him, on the best o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appeared to him the best measures for securing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and safety of his country? If he has not that right, he is no longer a free citizen, but
<PB N="27" REF="018438_0026_0FA76A6401B5B2C8"/>the slave of arbitrary power, and it matters nothing to him whether this power, by which he is thus enslaved, be lodged in the hands of many tyrants or of one, except that it is generally better to have but one master than ma∣ny. Of what service could my declaring of my senti∣ments at that time be to the British Ministers? I had lost my popularity and influence with my countrymen, and my opinion and arguments were not likely to be attended to, or to have that weight which they might otherwise have been entitled to. But the publication of my letters in New-York, is a strong proof that I was far from being regarded as a friend, or as engaged in the British interest by their Ministers or by their officers. Had not the Count de Grasse unexpectedly arrived on our coast with a superior fleet, Lord Cornwallis and his army, instead of surrendering themselves prisoners of war, would have been victorious, and but for that, and other circumstan∣ces unforeseen and extremely improbable at the time I wrote, the campaign of 1781 must have terminated deci∣sively against us; this was not simply my opinion, it was the opinion of our ablest and most experienced Generals. In this situation had my letters been published, their con∣tents might have had some weight with my countrymen, but to publish them immediately after events had con∣tradicted my predictions, served no purpose but to expose me to ridicule and abuse. Had I been in the service and pay of this government, would its Ministers have taken this effectual measure to destroy my influence with my countrymen, and thereby render it impossible for me to be of any future service to them? Nothing can be more extravagantly absurd than the supposition. But if I was in the service of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> government, why, after the publica∣tion of my letters had drawn on me the resentment of my countrymen, and the epithets of a deserter and betrayer of the interests of my country, did I not venture over to this country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give the Ministers all the information and advice in my power? My countrymen in France and Holland at the time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho were the most zealous for inde∣pendence, and the most severe against Great-Britain and every thing in it, made no scruple of going over to Lon∣don on their private affairs, while I remained in Flanders in so obscure a situation, as to render it impossible for me
<PB N="28" REF="018438_0027_0FA76A64C10F4168"/>to be eitheir of service or prejudice to any one; and dur∣ing eighteen months, neither wrote a single letter to any one in Great-Britain, or received any from thence, except on account of a few books and other trifling articles which I could not procure elsewhere. If from my arrival in France in 1780, to the signing of the preliminary articles, I had any other correspondence in this country, let it be made to appear, I boldly challenge my accusers to pro∣duce the least proof of any; full two months since, it was published in the news-papers of this city, that I had been at Court, and was presented to his Majesty, had an audi∣ence of the Duke of Portland, dined with Mr. Fox, &amp;c. &amp;c. while to this hour I have not even seen his Majesty, or any one of the royal family, except the Prince of Wales at a distance and on horseback, nor have I any greater knowledge of any of the other great personages, with whom it has been assirmed that I am on such terms of intimacy. If it were not so, I could have no interest, no motive to deny or to conceal it.</P>
<P>But the truth is, that the stile of life which my circum∣stances have obliged me to take up, has prevented my forming a numerous acquaintance, either at court or in the city, the former I have never so much as entered, and most probable never shall. Soon after my arrival in Lon∣don, Gen. Arnold called twice on me at my lodgings, and was shewn into my chamber without being announ∣ced, be appeared not to reflect in how different a situation he now was, from that in which he formerly stood, when we were in the habits of the most intimate friendship; I therefore very freely put him in mind of it, and he dis∣continued his visits, and I have not seen or spoke to him for more than five months past.</P>
<P>I my letters of the 10th of June 1781, to Mr. R. Mor∣ris, published in New-York by Rivington, I gave my opi∣nion what the state of our commerce would be on a peace, and on the confirmation of our independant sovereignty, and I gave at large the reasons on which I had formerd that opinion, by an unfortunate accident; the contents of that letter have been made public, and to them I refer; hitherto I have seen nothing to contradict the sentiments I then entertained on this subject, but many things to confirm me in them, though I most sincerely wish that
<PB N="29" REF="018438_0028_0FA76A6733DB0640"/>experience, the infallible test of truth in such subjects, may finally prove them erroneous, and my arguments and conclusions to have been ill founded.—But neither for sometime before, or since my being in this country, has it been in my power, had I been disposed, to do any thing to the prejudice of our commerce, and I can with great sincerity declare, that interest, as well as a disposition in∣dependant of interested motives, will ever lead me to im∣prove every opportunity, to do what little may be in my power, to promote the commerce of my country, on the success of which, its future happiness and prosperity, so greatly depend.</P>
<P>If present or future events justify my apprehensions in my letter to Mr. Morris, am I to blame? Those events do not, and cannot depend on me;—what grounds have we to expect more from Great-Britain, than what other aliens and foreigners are entitled to? Or than what we are indulged with, by other nations, in their West-India possessions?</P>
<P>All the Spanish and Portugueze American ports, are shut against us, and against all the world, the Dutch ports of St. Eustatius and Curacoa, which islands produce noth∣ing, are open without reserve to us, but Surinam and Dema∣rara, productive colonies, have never been but partially open, nothing which could be sent to them from Europe, to any advantage, was allowed to be received from us, nor any thing which Holland had a demand for in Europe, to be taken by us, it has ever been much the same, in the French islands, and we are not by the treaty, entitled to any thing more in future; the protection and government of the West-India possessions, cost the European powers large sums, will they be at this expence, and give other na∣tions, the trade of them?</P>
<P>This nation was the first in Europe which saw its own interest, with respect to commerce, in a true light, and by the navagation act, came to a resolution, to reserve the most certain all the profits of trade, that of the carrying business, to its own subjects.—That act was the corner stone, on which the British commerce and matine rose, and on which it still rests.—Can it be expected, that this government should at this time repeal, or violate that act? Or that it should be dispensed with, in our favour? They
<PB N="30" REF="018438_0029_0FA76A70B45B4A30"/>who expect this, look for what I am convinced will never happen; ever since the existence of the navagation act, all the maritime nations, in Europe, have been adopting measures, in some degree similar, and now when com∣merce has become the first object, with all of them, and is so well understood, they must necessarily pursue the same system.</P>
<P>The armed neutrality was a mere temporary expedient, France furnished her islands with provisions by it, but she lost the commerce of them, for the time, she supplied her∣self, with timber, and naval stores, and manned her sleets by it, but she laid the ax to the root of her navigation and commerce, so long as it existed, and she was so sensible of this, that on the day of signing the preliminaries for peace with Great-Britain, she gave orders to exclude all foreign∣ers from her West-Indies; and the Dutch who expected to gain, lost the most by the armed neutrality; the conse∣quences of it, and the war, into which their republic was drawn by it, will be long and sensibly selt by their com∣merce, perhaps never recovered.</P>
<P>The great object, with Lord Sheffield, is to urge this government, to persevere in a system, which for more than a century past, the nation has never deviated from, and which all the maritime, and commercial nations in Europe, are now coming into.—Can any one complain of his Lord∣ship, on this account? Or suppose that the British govern∣ment, would not have done this, without foreign advice? Without information and counsel given by me? It is too ridiculous to merit any serious observations, or comment on, yet insinuations and reports of this kind, once spread have a most surprising, and lasting impression on the minds of honest, and unsuspecting people, who judging of others by themselves, cannot suspect that any one, can be base and wicked enough, to take up his pen, merely with the view of imposing on them.</P>
