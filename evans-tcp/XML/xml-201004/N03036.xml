<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Had the Favour of your obliging Letter, which was the more welcome, for the Present that accompany'd it. I fully concur with you in Opinion, that our Cause will not receive much prejudice, from the Pamphlet you sent me, intitled, <HI>The Scripture-Bishop examin'd.</HI> For tho' the Author has entertain'd us, with a pompous and plausible Ha∣rangue; and (to do him justice) has done as well as the
<PB N="2" REF="003651_0004_10023C0C47A7E660"/>Subject was capable of; and indeed, made the best Appearance, of any that I know of, who have publick∣ly espoused the same Cause: Yet I think 'twill appear, that he has done little more towards a refutation of the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> than to make a flourishing Shew, by a master∣ly Air of Contempt, by great Words, bold Assertions, and weak Arguments. And I should not know what excuse to make, for his assigning the <HI>same Reasons</HI> to establish his Cause, as are particularly <HI>refuted</HI> in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> without taking any notice of such refutati∣on; and for his wholly overlooking almost all the Arguments in the <HI>second</HI> Conference, in a professed Examination of them; had not <HI>he</HI> himself furnished me with an <HI>Apology.</HI> <Q>Error hath so foul and ugly a Complexion, that it makes it need, and covet a Vizor, to hide it's Deformity; and can only be set forth with false and artificial Colours. The People are to be lulled into an undisturbed Security, and the Errors of the <HI>[Prela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y]</HI> disguised.</Q></P>
<P>He indeed in his <HI>Second</HI> Letter tells us, that <Q>he does not think himself at all obliged, to regard my sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng the Questions in Dispute.</Q> And I grant, that he was under no Obligation, to enter upon the Examination of Arguments, that he could not answer. But if he will assume the Province of an <HI>Examiner,</HI> the World justly expects, that he should at least take some notice, of what he pretends to examine; they will else take liberty to think, notwithstanding his assuming Mein, and his merry Squ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bs at the Dissenters (as he is pleas'd to call us) that the <HI>Dialogue</HI> yet stands its Ground; and that a new Edition of it would be a sufficient Reply to his Invectives. However since he is for the shortest and safest Way, I will endeavour to follow him in his own Path.</P>
<P>I shall not disturb him at present, in his Merriment with the <HI>Platform of Church Discipline,</HI> hoping be∣fore I have done, to make up that Accompt with him once for all; and fully prove to him, the un∣doubted
<PB N="3" REF="003651_0004_10023C0C47A7E660"/>Claim of a particular Church, to choose their own Minister; and that tho' <HI>coming under a Sepa∣ration to</HI> the sacred Service, makes a Man a Minister; yet it gives him no Right <HI>to minister unto a particular Church,</HI> without their Consent. I shall therefore im∣mediately consider, what he has to say in answer to the <HI>Dialogue.</HI></P>
<P>And I am first of all to pay him my Acknowledge∣ments, for such an unexampled Instance of Modesty and Candour, as must not be lightly overlook'd; which is exhibited in the following Words.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Script. Bp. Examin'd, pag. 3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>He begins his Attack with an endeavour to pre∣judice his unwary Reader, by branding a Church remarkable for her Indulgence, to Dissenters of all Denominations, with the hateful Name of Persecu∣tion.— Is it not however, astonishing, that any con∣siderate Man, should furnish his Adversary with a Weapon, wherewith to dispatch himself? This our Author has effectually done: For has not <HI>New-England</HI> been notorious, for her Barbarities and cruel Persecutions? Does▪ she not still continue to persecute honest and well meaning Christians, Mem∣bers of the true Church, by robbing them of their Estates, towards the support of Schismatical Tea∣chers; and does she not yearly imprison their Bo∣dies, for refusing to comply with her wicked and unjust Demands? Again, it will not (I hope) be impertinent, to ask (supposing the Truth of the a∣foresaid Allegation) if the Dissenters ever did suf∣fer such Persecution from the Church of England, as she has suffered from them? &amp;c. — Episcopacy they abolished, murdered two Arch-Bishops, defaced, abused, demolished Churches. The Clergy many thousands in Number, they imprisoned, plundered, ejected &amp;c.— whose Sufferings therefore, must entitle them to the Character of the true Church?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003651_0005_10023C2969DA8210"/>
Here we have the <HI>Church of England</HI> represented in the brightest Colours, for her remarkable Indul∣gence to Dissenters of all Denominations. The <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> are painted as the most black and barbarous Persecutors; and <HI>New England</HI> especially, as being notorious for her Barbarities, and cruel Persecutions; and the <HI>Church of England</HI> by her unheard of Suffer∣ings, entitled to the Character of the true Church. But what Proofs does he give us of all this? What Evidence have we of any one of these Facts, besides the bare Word of a Gentleman, which he may think it unmannerly, for any one to call into Question? But I think it would not have been amiss for him, to have considered his own Rule in this Case, that "unauthorized Assertions deserve no Confuta∣tion"</P>
<P>Persecution is such an unmerciful Violation of all the Laws of Humanity and so diametrically opposite to the Spirit of the Gospel, that nothing can be just∣ly said in its favour, whosoever are chargeable with it. It cannot be painted in too black colours, nor rendred too odious to the World. It may therefore be worth the while, to inquire into the Justice of this Gentleman's Declamation against the Dissenters, and to consider how much his Cause will gain, by the Com∣parison which he provokes us to make.</P>
<P>You can't expect, that I should give a particular relation of all the Persecutions we have suffered from the episcopal Party. This would require several Vo∣lumes in Folio. Some brief Hints may be sufficient, to discover the Modesty of this Gentleman, in the confident Assertions under Consideration.</P>
<P>The first remarkable <HI>Persecution</HI> in this Cause, fell upon that famous Martyr Dr. <HI>Hooper,</HI> who with seve∣ral other eminent Reformers, and afterwards Martyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Protestant Cause, as <HI>Rogers, Latimer, Coverdale, Taylor, Philpot, Bradford,</HI> &amp;c questioned the lawful∣ness of the Habits, then and ever since, imposed upon the Clergy of the Church of England; and was
<PB N="5" REF="003651_0005_10023C2969DA8210"/>therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into Prison, and continued there some Months, in expectation of Death, for refusing a <HI>Bishoprick,</HI> because he could not in Conscience be consecrated in those Vestments; nor be anointed at his Consecration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fox,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atin Book of Martyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 280. <HI>Neal,</HI> Hist. of the Puri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 71.</NOTE></P>
<P>We hear but little more of <HI>Persecution</HI> in this Cause, during the short remainder of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Reign; and one would think 'twere impossible, that it should enter into the Hearts of <HI>Protestants,</HI> to worry one another, in the bloody <HI>Marian</HI> Reign, when they were all passing thro' the Furnace of papal Rage and Fury. But how improbable soever, we have an In∣stance of it in this Reign also. Among the Exiles that fled from the <HI>Smithfield</HI> Flames, a considerable Con∣gregation setled at <HI>Frankford,</HI> were by the Magistrates admitted to a Partnership in the <HI>French Church.</HI> These agreed upon a further Reformation, left off the Use of the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> chose that most excellent Man Mr. <HI>John Knox</HI> for their Pastor, lived quietly, and wor∣shipped God in Peace and Purity; until Dr. <HI>Cox,</HI> and some other Bigots for the English Ceremonies, came among them, strenuously insisted upon the Use of the <HI>Service Book,</HI> disturbed their publick Worship, and (finding they could compass their ends no other way) accused Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> of high Treason against the Emperor, on Account of a Passage in an english Book of his, printed some years before in <HI>England,</HI> wherein he truly observ'd, that <HI>the Emperor was no less an E∣nemy to Christ, than Nero.</HI> By which means Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> was banished the Town, the Congregation broke up, and the remaining, Bigots left to quarrel it out a∣mong themselves, till they became a Scandal to all Men, both <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Papists.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strypes's</HI> Life of <HI>Grindal,</HI> p. 19, 20. <HI>Hist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> of the Trouble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Frankford,</HI> printed 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5</NOTE></P>
<P>These Instances give us a Taste of the Lenity of this Party; but the succeeding Reign of <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003651_0006_10023C2C30EBD1A8"/>affords a more tragical Story; and gives us an odd Idea of the <HI>remarkable Indulgence to Dissenters of all Denominations,</HI> which our Author boasts of.</P>
<P>Upon the Accession of that <HI>Queen</HI> to the Throne, all our Divines that truly hated <HI>Popery,</HI> were for a further Reformation, as Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> proves by many Authorities.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> of the Dissenters, p. 43.</NOTE> But the Queen so loved State and Magnificence in Religion, and was so fond of the Rites and Ceremonies, in which she had been educated, that she would hear nothing of it. But in the first year of her Reign, procured the fatal <HI>Act of Unifor∣mity,</HI> which proved so destructive to the Peace of the Church, and such an Engine of Torture, to so many of the best Protestants in the Nation. Many that were gaping for Promotions, fell in with the Court; but yet such was the general Aversion against these <HI>Rem∣nants of Popery,</HI> as they were then justly called, that four Years after this, Proposals for a further Reforma∣tion were brought into Convocation; and voted by the majority of the Clergy present: but rejected by the majority of one single Voice of a Proxy.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's</HI> Annals. p. 337. <HI>Neal</HI>'s Hist. or the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> From this Time, we are to expect nothing but <HI>Impositions</HI> and <HI>Persecutions,</HI> on account of these scrupled and debated Points.</P>
<P>About a Year after this, Anno 1564, sundry of the <HI>Bishops</HI> meet in London, the London-Ministers are convented before them, and required upon pain of Deprivation, <HI>to promise and subscribe Conformity to the Habits, and likewise to the Rites of the Common-Prayer, the XXXIX Articles; and the Queen's Injunctions.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's</HI> An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 419.</NOTE> Many were for Non-conformity suspended and de∣prived; and themselves and Families brought to ex∣treme Poverty. Now were two of the most eminent Divines in the english Church, <HI>Sampson</HI> Dean of Christ Church, and <HI>Humphreys</HI> President of Magda∣len College <HI>Oxon,</HI> convented and imprisoned for Non-conformity,
<PB N="7" REF="003651_0006_10023C2C30EBD1A8"/><HI>Sampson</HI> deposed, and <HI>Humphreys</HI> afrighted from returning to <HI>Oxford,</HI> tho' his Place was not at their Dispose.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal</HI>'s Hist. of the Purit. p. 208.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next Year <HI>(1565)</HI> was there a new Citation of the London Clergy, who were positively required to subscribe to an absolute Conformity, upon pain of Contempt. These Ministers cried out for Compassion to themselves and Families, saying, <HI>We shall be killed in our Souls, for this Pollution of ours:</HI> but there could be no Compassion for such Criminals; thirty seven of them are at once deprived of their Ministry, and ma∣ny of them reduced to Beggary, tho' the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> himself acknowledged them to be some of the best Preachers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 211.—<HI>Strype</HI>'s Annals, p. 463.</NOTE> Thus are the poor People deprived of the Bread of Life; and a great Part of the Churches shut up, for want of Preachers.</P>
<P>Two Years after (Anno 1567) a Congregation of about a hundred Persons was broken up, the most of them taken and committed to the <HI>Compter,</HI> from thence brought before the <HI>Bishop,</HI> examined, and a great part of them sent to <HI>Bridewel;</HI> where they were kept in strict Durance above a Year, for absenting from their Parish Churches, and for maintaining separate Assem∣blies for Prayer and Preaching, and Administring the Sacraments.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal</HI>'s Hist. of the Purit. p. 242.— <HI>Cotton's</HI> Congreg. Way cleared, p. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>The two following Years, the Eyes of the Court, and of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> were turned another way. They were alarmed with the Confederacy of the <HI>Popish Princes,</HI> to root the Reformation out of Europe; and seem something to overlook the poor <HI>Non-conformists.</HI> But in the Year 1570, the penal Laws were executed to purpose, upon many that were cited to the Spiri∣tual Courts; and after long Attendance and great Charges, suspended or deprived; among whom was the famous Mr. <HI>Axton,</HI> Minister of <HI>Morton Cobbet,</HI> who
<PB N="8" REF="003651_0007_10023C2F967B3408"/>was deprived of his Living; and driven to seek his Bread in another Country: And the memorable Mr. <HI>Thomas Cartwright,</HI> B. D. and Fellow of Trinity Col∣lege <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who was deprived of his Fellowship, and expelled the University for Non-conformity.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal</HI>'s Hist. of the Purit. p. 256, &amp; forward.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the two following Years (1571, 1572.) notwith∣standing the several strong Attempts in <HI>Parliament,</HI> for a further Reformation, and for putting an End to these Persecutions, they were continued with a Wit∣ness. In <HI>June</HI> 1571, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> summoned about a dozen of the chief remaining Ministers, about Lon∣don, that scrupled the Habits and Ceremonies; and suspended them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 280.</NOTE> And not long after, were about a hundred other Ministers deprived, for the same pre∣tended Crime; and two of them were imprisoned a Year and four Months in <HI>Newgate,</HI> for presenting a Petition to the <HI>Parliament</HI> for Relief; and several others deprived, for speaking favourably of the imprisoned Ministers.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype</HI>'s Ann. p. 187. <HI>Neal,</HI> from p. 284, to 296.</NOTE></P>
<P>The very next Year (1573) there was a severe <HI>Persecution</HI> of the <HI>Puritans</HI> (as the Non-conformists were then called) throughout the Kingdom. The <HI>Queen</HI> publishes a Proclamation, that all Offenders a∣gainst the Act of Uniformity, should be severely pu∣nished. In the single Diocese of <HI>Norwich,</HI> were three hundred▪ Ministers suspended: by which we may con∣jecture what Work was made, in the rest of the King∣dom. A Number of Ministers were deprived; and four of the most noted, committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> for re∣fusing to declare, that the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book is, every Part of it, grounded on the Scripture.</HI> New Tests were devised, to ensnare the Consciences both of the Clergy and Laity; by which means, Numbers of each were committed to Prison, Spies were set upon all that came to visit the Prisoners, and bring them Relief; and one eminent Minister (Mr. <HI>Robert John∣son</HI>) died in Prison, in great Poverty and Want.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> fr. p. 304, to 324.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003651_0007_10023C2F967B3408"/>
In the two following Years (1574, 1575) the <HI>Pu∣ritans</HI> had more Rest: and I find them harassed with no new <HI>Persecutions,</HI> besides the breaking up of their Religious Meetings. But the poor <HI>Anabaptists</HI> had a sad Taste of the Clemency of the Times. Twenty-seven of these were taken at publick Worship, nine of them banished, and two burnt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal,</HI> p. 340.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the next Year, were no less than seven Mini∣sters deprived for Non-conformity, in the City of <HI>Nor∣wich;</HI> and considerable Numbers elsewhere, tho' I can't find a particular Account of their Number.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 348</NOTE></P>
<P>In the two following Years (1577, 1578) it appears, that the <HI>Persecution</HI> had made such a scarcity of <HI>Prea∣chers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that in the large and populous Town of <HI>Northampton,</HI> there was not so much as one <HI>Preacher</HI> left. In the County of <HI>Cornwal</HI> were 140 Clergy-men, not one of which was capable of preach∣ing a Sermon. By a Petition to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> from the City of <HI>London,</HI> it appears, that <Q>one half at least of their Churches, are utterly unfurnish'd of preach∣ing Ministers.— That there is scarce a tenth Man of them, that makes Conscience to wait upon his Charge.</Q> By a Supplication from <HI>Cornwal</HI> it ap∣pears, that <Q>there were above the number of four∣score and ten thousand Souls, that for want of the Word of God, were in extream Misery, and ready to perish— That they had about 160 Churches, the greatest part of which were supplied by Men guil∣ty of the grossest Sins, some Fornicators, some A∣dulterers, some Felons bearing the mark in their Hands for said Offence, some Drunkards, some Gamesters &amp;c. — That they had some Ministers, that laboured painfully and faithfully in the Lord's Husbandry: but these Men were not suffered to attend their Callings &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 365, 366.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>In the Years 1580, &amp; 1581, the Sufferings of the Non-conformists were not lessened. The Ministers were
<PB N="10" REF="003651_0008_10023C3E097DFA38"/>shut up in <HI>Newgate,</HI> the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> and other Prisons in and about <HI>London.</HI> And a considerable Number of them are elsewhere imprisoned, upon the same account. Twelve Articles of Impeachment are drawn up against the Justices of the Quarter Sessions, by the enraged <HI>Bishop,</HI> because they had the Courage to move his Lordship, in Favour of the imprisoned Ministers.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal,</HI> p. 372, 379.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Case of the <HI>Puritan</HI> Ministers the two follow∣ing Years (1582, 1583) may be seen from a Petition of the Justices of the Peace for the County of <HI>Essex,</HI> to the Lords of Council. <Q>The painful Ministers of the Word (say they) are marshelled with the worst Malefactors, presented, indicted, arraigned and con∣demned, for Matters, as we presume, of very slen∣der Moment; some for leaving the Holidays unbid∣den, some for singing the Psalms—<HI>nunc Dimittis</HI>—in the Morning; some for turning the Questions con∣cerning Faith, from the Infants, to the God-fathers, which is but YOU for THOU; some for leaving out the Cross in Baptism; some for leaving out the Ring in Marriage, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's</HI> Ann. p. 184.</NOTE></Q> The Justice of these Com∣plaints is manifest, from the several Instances of barba∣rous Severity, transmitted to our Times; particularly the putting to Death of two Ministers, Mr. <HI>Copping</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thacker,</HI> for Non-conformity; and the sus∣pending no less than two hundred thirty three Mini∣sters for not subscribing to the Book of Common Prayer, and of the Ordination of Priests and Deacons, as containing nothing contrary to the Word of God. And a great many others for other Causes, some of whom were Dignitaries in the Church, most of them Graduates in the University; of these some were al∣lowed time, but forty nine were absolutely deprived at once.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 186. <HI>Neal's</HI> Hist. of the Purit. p. 400.</NOTE></P>
<P>One would think that this Year's Severity, in exe∣cuting some, and suspending and depriving such a vast
<PB N="11" REF="003651_0008_10023C3E097DFA38"/>Number of godly and faithful Ministers, might have satiated the violent Appetite of the <HI>Bishops</HI> to <HI>Perse∣cution;</HI> but such a dreadful Scene opens the very next Year (1584) as may well strike the Mind with Hor∣ror: and cannot be justly represented, by the brief Hints to which I have necessarily limited my self, in this Letter. Numbers of Ministers are again suspend∣ed; and notwithstanding their own Petition, the Pe∣tition of their Parishioners, the Petition of the Gen∣tlemen of the several Counties, in their Favour; and the Petition of the Inhabitants of <HI>Malden,</HI> representing, that <Q>since their Ministers had been taken from them, — they had none left, but such as they could prove unfit for that Office— Men of Occupation, serving Men, and the basest of all Sorts, Rioters, Dicers, Drunkards &amp;c.</Q>— and notwithstanding the Petition of the Inhabitants of <HI>Norwich</HI> to the same effect; the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> is so far from mitigating his rigorous Proceedings, that he seeks and obtains a new ecclesi∣astical Commission, by which he and his Brethren are authorized to examine the Ministers upon Oath, of their Opinions and Practices, that the most inward Sentiments of the Mind, and the most private religious Exercises, may not be concealed from these Inquisitors. And such merciless Use was made of this Commission, that the cry of the Sufferers reached up to Heaven. The Lord <HI>Treasurer</HI> separately, the Lords of the <HI>Queen's</HI> Counsel conjunctly, remonstrate to the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> against these Proceedings; A Bill passed in the House of <HI>Commons</HI> against them: but the <HI>Queen</HI> stood by the <HI>Bishops;</HI> and the <HI>Persecutions</HI> go on. Multitude of Ministers are every where suspended, no less than thirty eight by the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in one Visitation. The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> writ to the <HI>Treasurer,</HI> that <HI>he had rather die, or live in Prison all the Days of his Life, than relax the rigour of his Proceedings, by shewing Favour to one.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal's</HI> Hist. of the Purit. from p. 404, to 462.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003651_0009_10023C32572FFD48"/>
In the two following Years (1585, &amp;1586) the <HI>Per∣secution</HI> went on as before, some are suspended and deprived of their Ministry, some cast into Prison; and even some chained with Irons, and continued in hard Durance for a long time: and such a Scarcity of Mi∣nisters is by this means procured, that there were but two thousand Preachers, to serve near ten thousand Parishes. In one County there were but twelve Preachers, to three hundred thirty five Churches.

<P>In the succeeding Year (1587) the Storm continued so heavy from the same Quarter, that of the ninety seven Preaching Ministers, found last Year in the City of <HI>London,</HI> there is now but nineteen resident Preach∣ers, in that great and populous City.</P>
<P>I had thought to have gone on, in a brief annual Representation of these terrible Sufferings of the Non-conformists, further to display episcopal Clemency: but I find the Instances croud so fast upon me, that I must necessarily be too voluminous, if I am any thing particular. I shall therefore content my self, with only laying before you, some of the most horrid and un∣merciful Cruelties of the following Times; and over∣look the common Course of their <HI>remarkable Indulgence to the Dissenters of all Denominations,</HI> by suspending the Ministers, and depriving the People of the Ordi∣nances of Salvation.</P>
<P>The first Instance I shall take notice of, is the un∣exampled Barbarity used towards that great Divine and eminent Christian Mr. <HI>John Udal,</HI> who was ac∣cused of writing a Book, wherein were some just Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lections upon the <HI>Bishops,</HI> for countenancing Profane∣ness
<PB N="13" REF="003651_0009_10023C32572FFD48"/>and Impiety; and for afflicting and molesting those that were truly Religious. For this he is sent to the <HI>Gate-House,</HI> kept close Prisoner, not suffered to have Pen Ink or Paper, or any Body to speak with him; not so much as his Wife was suffered to come to him, nor to speak to him but at a distance. On the 23 of July 1590, he is brought to <HI>Croydon</HI> in Irons: and tho' he never owned, nor could they prove, that he was the Author of the Book; nor was there any Appearance of <HI>Felony</HI> in it, whoever was the Author; he is nevertheless tryed and condemned: Sentence of Death was passed upon him, and Execution openly commanded. And tho' Execution was a while res∣pited, there was no means to obtain his Pardon. Neither the earnest Intercession of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> on his Behalf, nor the Intreaty of all his Friends, would prevail for his Release: But his Death in Prison, by the hard Usage he met with, prevented a more infamous End.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce's</HI> Vind. p. 129, to 138.</NOTE> By which you may see what Justice there was, in the Conclusion of his Address to his Judges: <HI>As the Blood of Abel, so the Blood of Udal will cry to God with a loud Voice; and the righteous Judge of the Land will require it of all that shall be guilty of it.</HI></P>
<P>In this same Year, the celebrated Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> (who had all this while passed through a continued Series of Tribulation) falls again into the Clutches of the High-Commission, with fifteen other Ministers. And tho' all proper Endeavours were used, to get them set at Liberty, or admitted to Bail; neither their own Petition, nor the Intercession of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> for them, would prevail. Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> is kept close Prisoner two Years; and the rest much longer.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal's</HI> Hist. of the Purit. P 519, to 533.</NOTE></P>
<P>About the same time, a Congregation in <HI>London</HI> conven'd for the Worship of God, being found out, are taken, fifty six of them are committed to several
<PB N="14" REF="003651_0010_10023C12024F7DE0"/>Prisons, to keep Company with several eminent Mi∣nisters, who were there before. It appears by one of their Petitions, that there were sixty seven thus con∣fined, besides Women, and besides ten of their Number, that had died of their Hardships. Their Case was most movingly represented, by their Petition to the Coun∣cil, in these words, <Q>The <HI>Praelates</HI> of this Land, have for a long Time dealt most injuriously with us — persecuting, imprisoning and detaining at their Pleasure, our poor Bodies, without any Tryal, Release or Bail: and hitherto without any Cause, either for Error or Crime, directly objected—Some of us, they have kept in close Prison four or five Years, with miserable Usage — others they have cast into Newgate, and laden with as many Irons as they could bear; others into Dungeons and loathsome Goals, among the most facinorous and vile Persons, Where it is lamentable to relate, how many have perished within these five Years; aged Widows, aged Men and young Maidens &amp;c. Where so many as the Infection hath spared, lie in woful Distress, like to follow their Fellows, if speedy Re∣dress be not had. Others of us, have been grie∣vously beaten with Cudgels in Bridewel; and cast into a Place called <HI>little Ease,</HI> for refusing to come to their Chappel Services.</Q> Some of these were after a long Imprisonment, released from their intol∣lerable Sufferings, by being sent into Banishment, and others by being publickly executed as Felons, among whom were Mr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Gray's Inn;</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Greenwood,</HI> a famous and worthy Mini∣ster of the Gospel, who were both hanged at <HI>Tyburn.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal</HI>'s Hist. p 545, to 558. <HI>Pierce,</HI> Vind. p. 144, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>But a very little after this bloody Tradegy, another eminently learned and pious Minister of the Gospel, Mr. <HI>John Penry,</HI> was also crowned with Martyrdom, and joined to the other Souls under the Altar, that <HI>are crying with a loud Voice, How long, Lord, holy and

<P>I might have given you many more Instances of most merciless Cruelties and horrid Barbarities, in this Reign of <HI>Queen Elizabeth:</HI> but I'm perswaded you have by this time a just Idea of the <HI>remarkable In∣dulgence that the Dissenters of all Denominations met with</HI> from the <HI>Church of England.</HI></P>
<P>The Nonconformists entertain'd great Expectati∣ons, that their long and grievous Persecutions under <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI> would have▪ happily terminated, by the Influence of <HI>King James,</HI> who had been brought to his Crown, protected, defended and educated, by the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and who had sundry Times inter∣ceeded for the persecuted Non-conformists, in the Reign of his Predecessor: but they soon discover'd their mistake. For notwithstanding their Petition, signed by a thousand Hands; and notwithstanding this <HI>King's</HI> former Dislike of the Cruelties exercised a∣gainst them, as well as of the <HI>english Service,</HI> which in a Speech to the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI> he <HI>called an evil said Mass in English, that wanted nothing of the Mass but the Liftings;</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood's</HI> Hist. p. 286.</NOTE> They met with the same kind of Treatment in his Reign, as in the preceeding.</P>
<P>In his Speech to his first Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> he professes, <HI>that the Sect of the Puritans or Novellists was not to be suffered, in any well govern'd Commonwealth— He acknowleges the Church of Rome to be our Mother Church, tho' defiled with some Corruptions; That he would be content for his own Part, to meet those of the Roman Church in the Mid-way</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE> This was justly look'd upon as a Cloud, that boded a terrible Storm to the poor <HI>Puritans,</HI> or Non-conformists, and it accordingly fell on them with a Witness.</P>

In the second Year (says a learned and faithful Historian of that Time) after the King's coming into England, <Q>three hundred Ministers were either si∣lenced or deprived of their Benefices, or excommu∣nicated, or cast into Prisons, or forced to leave their own Country.

A Declaration is published, giving Li∣berty for all manner of Sports on the Lord's Day; and the poor Nonconformist-Ministers, that refused to read it publickly, or that spoke against that horrible Profanation of the Sabbath, were every where trodden under Foot; and some of them severely handled.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pierce's</HI> Vind. p. 164, to 167.</NOTE></P>

Private Clergy-men set up <HI>Images</HI> in their Churches, placed their Commu∣nion Table <HI>Altar</HI>-wise, and forced People to the Idolatry of bowing to 'em; pressed their People to confess their Sins; and preached up their own Power of absolving them: if any opposed them, they fell under their Wrath &amp; Fury.

<P>The Instances of these Barbarities are numberless. I must therefore content my self with transcribing a Summary of this matter; as it is represented, by the Author of the <HI>Memoirs of the Church of Scotland,</HI> Part 3. p. 290 &amp;c.</P>
<Q><P>In this <HI>Persecution,</HI> as has been collected from the Accounts both publick and private, above eigh∣teen thousand People have suffered the utmost Extremities, their Enemies could inflict; of which the following Particulars are a part, many of which can be proved even to the Names of the Persons, with the Places of their Abode.</P>
<P>Seventeen hundred have been banished as Slaves to the english Plantations, besides such as were by order of Council, at the beginning of the Persecu∣tion, ordered on pain of Death to leave their Coun∣try, which amounted to eighty seven; and besides seven hundred and fifty banished to <HI>Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land,</HI> to the
<PB N="26" REF="003651_0016_10023C1AD5F9DEA8"/><HI>Isles</HI> of <HI>Lewis, Orkney,</HI> and to other remote Places belonging to <HI>Scotland;</HI> of these two hundred were wilfully and premeditately murdered, by keeping them under Hatches till they were drowned, when the Ship was stranded, and there was time for them to escape.</P>
<P>Eight hundred were out-lawed, as we call it in <HI>England,</HI> about the time of <HI>Pentland</HI> affair; by or∣der of the <HI>High Commission</HI> Court: and fifty five eminent Persons, were panelled, as the <HI>Scots</HI> Laws term it — and were sentenced to be executed, with∣out further Prosecutions, when they should be ta∣ken, as many of them afterwards were; among those were ten or eleven Ministers.</P>
<P>It is impossible to give an Account of those, who perished by unjust and tedious Confinement in Pri∣sons, by the barbarity of mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iless Jaylors or Keep∣ers, Stench of close and horrid Dungeons &amp; Vaults, want of Conveniencies &amp;c.—They who think they have modestly computed the Number of these (for an exact Account cannot be had) tell us, they a∣mount to above three thousand, six hundred.—</P>
<P>Those that have fled from their Country, forced into voluntary Banishment, in <HI>England, Ireland, Holland, Sweden</HI> &amp;c. where they were driven into great distress,— the Number of these has been esteemed by such as think they have made a modest Calculation, at above seven thousand.</P>
<P>Besides these, there were abundance of innocent and pious Sufferers, who were basely murdered by the Soldiers and Persecutors; — being generally killed in cold Blood, without any process of Law civil or military, without any visible Crime, Charge, or Examination; of these, the printed Accounts tell us of seventy eight murdered by particular Persons; and I am well assured there were very many more; and I have heard, that a Person whom I have not met with, has the Names of above four hundred and twenty more: But that Number I dare not avouch.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="003651_0016_10023C1AD5F9DEA8"/>
The Number really executed in the pretended course of Justice,— and who died by the Hangman, is very great; and I am told that three hundred sixty two are to be found upon the several Books of the Justiciary and Council Courts, upon Record, besides what were executed by military Laws as they call them, of which no Record has been kept.</P>
<P>The Number of those who perished thro' Cold, Hunger, and other Distresses, contracted in their Flight into Mountains, Wandrings without Shelter or Harbour, in dreadful Winters &amp;c.—These were many Thousands, and cannot be calculated; but will certainly make up more than the Number of eighteen thousand.</P>
<P>Among these, I say nothing of the Pillage and Spoil of Goods, the turning Women and Children out into the Fields, in Cold and Nakedness, after devouring their Food, and tearing off their Cloaths from their Backs, of which many perished for Want, and by the Extremities of the Weather.</P></Q>
<P>Such as these have been the Trials, those of our Profession have passed thro' from the Episcopalians, in defence of the <HI>divine Institutions,</HI> and of a good Con∣science toward God. And can the Gentleman I op∣pose pretend, that the other Side have ever met with such like Sufferings from us, as I have mentioned a∣bove, that he should so confidently put us upon ma∣king the Comparison? Let the World judge, whe∣ther this ben't a sufficient <HI>Vindication,</HI> of what was but occasionally mentioned in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> and what causelesly put the Gentleman into such a Hear.</P>
<P>Tho' I can't agree with him in supposing, that the Sufferings of any Profession necessarily <HI>intitle them to the Character of the true Church;</HI> nor wou'd I by ripping up old Faults, create fresh Resentments among Parties: Yet I think, what I have said upon this Head, will justify my proposing these Things, as a sufficient Call to <HI>look into the Cause,</HI> for which so ma∣ny excellent Persons have suffered; as well as justly
<PB N="28" REF="003651_0017_10023C45A4EF98D0"/>awaken every one, to an Abhorrence of these execra∣ble Methods of propagating their religious Principles, which I wou'd hope our Adversaries themselves are by this Time heartily ashamed of.</P>
<P>And now let us consider our Author's particular Charges against <HI>us.</HI> <Q>Has not <HI>New-England</HI> (says he) been notorious for her <HI>Barbarities</HI> and cruel <HI>Perse∣cutions?</HI> Does she not yet continue to persecute ho∣nest and well meaning Christians, Members of the true Church, by robbing them of their Estates, to∣wards the Support of Schismatical Teachers? and does she not yearly imprison their Bodies? &amp;c.</Q> To which I answer, if he can make our this Charge by sufficient Evidences, I shall join with him, in bear∣ing my Testimony against these things. For I look upon <HI>Persecution</HI> to be too black and enormous a Crime, to admit of any Apology; and it is full as bad in <HI>New-England,</HI> as any where else.</P>
<P>I freely acknowledge, that in the Infancy of <HI>New-England,</HI> they made some <HI>severe Laws</HI> against certain Seducers, crowding in among them, who threatned no less than the Dissolution of their Government. There were some Severities used in those days, particularly toward a sort of <HI>Quakers,</HI> that were scarce justifiable; neither do we go about to <HI>justify</HI> them: yet, I must observe, that upon a fair State of the Matter, much might be pleaded to <HI>extenuate</HI> those Proceedings, and make them appear abundantly <HI>less</HI> harsh and rigorous, than they are by our Adversaries represented to be. But make the <HI>worst</HI> of them, I believe the Case can never be made a <HI>Parallel</HI> with <HI>that,</HI> our Author would compare it to. For how widely different is the pu∣nishing profane insolent Disturbers of solemn publick Worship, open Deriders and Subverters of the Christian Faith, and factious Despisers of civil Government; how widely different, I say, is this Case from that of punishing orthodox peaceable and faithful Christians, for <HI>mere Nonconformity</HI> to be established Church in some Points of Ceremony and Order!— For it seems,
<PB N="29" REF="003651_0017_10023C45A4EF98D0"/>the <HI>Sectaries</HI> of that Day, against whom those <HI>New-England</HI> Laws were chiefly sharpned, were a more tumultuous and blasphemous Generation, than in af∣ter times. However, there were but few Prosecutions, upon those Laws, before the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> grew sensible of their Error in making them, and soon went into an intire <HI>Toleration</HI> of the various Sectaries crept in amongst them. And when the Revolution came, the <HI>Convention</HI> (in <HI>Massachusetts</HI>) upon that Occasion, unanimously voted, That <HI>any Laws, which might seem — contrary to a due Liberty of Conscience, never should be executed in the Territory</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindication</HI> of <HI>N. E.</HI> against a late <HI>Address</HI> of a Faction there, p. 17, 18.</NOTE>. And since that Time several Laws have been made for the Ease of <HI>Quakers, Anabaptists,</HI> and <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> with Relation to the publick Taxes. So that I know of nothing, that can free our Author (as to the substance of his Crimination) from the guilt of groundless Slander and Calumny.</P>
<P>It is true, that some former Laws of <HI>New-England,</HI> which have had the royal Approbation, and are there∣fore the <HI>King's</HI> Laws, do intitle the Minister, elected by the Majority of the Inhabitants within his Parish, to the Salary agreed upon by them, to be levied by Rate upon 'em all. If the Majority of the Parish be <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> their Minister has a legal claim to the Salary: but if the Majority be of our Perswasion, their Minister in like manner has the Claim. And what Grounds then can there be for this tragical Outcry? Certainly it is not over-modest, for a Clergyman of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> to exclaim after this manner, when it's notorious, that not only the <HI>Tenths</HI> of their Income are paid by all Professions in <HI>England,</HI> to the established Clergy: but that the episcopal Clergy <HI>e∣very where</HI> exact their <HI>Salary,</HI> from those of other Persuasions, where they can legally do it. This is exemplified in <HI>New-York;</HI> and on the West End of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> where the Episcopalians are not above a
<PB N="30" REF="003651_0018_10023C0FA4907D28"/>tenth Part of the People. And thus it is also in <HI>Mary∣land, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>But what makes this Crimination the more extra∣vagant is, that such Regard has been had to the epis∣copal Clergy amongst us, that in <HI>Massachusett</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Governments, wherever there is an epis∣copal Incumbent setled, he is intitled by <HI>Laws</HI> not long since made, to <HI>that Part</HI> of the Tax for the Support of the Ministry, which is paid by the Mem∣bers of <HI>his own</HI> Congregation. And each episcopal Congregation hath power to raise what Tax they please among themselves, for the Support of their Mi∣nister.</P>
<P>And all must acknowlege, that <HI>from the Beginning</HI> our Treatment of <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> coming into these Parts, has been with an exemplary <HI>Candour, Charity</HI> and <HI>Civility.</HI> Many Years passed indeed before the <HI>Church of England</HI> Service or Common Prayer was publickly us'd in the Country: But what was the <HI>Reason?</HI> Because there never was all that while a sufficient Number to form a Congregation, or else they cou'd never find Clergymen to undertake the Cure of their Souls One or other of these was the true Reason. Not, because the <HI>Government</HI> forbad or hin∣der'd their Setting up the <HI>Episcopal Way.</HI> No; <HI>They</HI> have always had that Regard to the Law of christian Forbearance, that they never (as I can learn) gave the least molestation to that Way: altho', it's well known that <HI>New-England</HI> was sought by the first Planters as a Retreat from the Imposition of some Ceremonies in the Church Service. All along, if any appearing to be Men fearing, God, have offer'd to joyn in Worship with the Churches here, they have readily been re∣ceiv'd to Communion in special Ordinances, notwith∣standing their being in Judgment Episcopal. And in later Times, wherever a number in any Place have been desirous to set up the Way of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> no Interruption has been given to their At∣tempts: save what is common to their Neighbours
<PB N="31" REF="003651_0018_10023C0FA4907D28"/>of our own Persuasion, in the Case of setting up a new Congregation.</P>
<P>But let us now turn the Tables, and see how it far'd with <HI>us,</HI> when in an <HI>evil Reign</HI> we lost our Char∣ters, and the Government fell into Episcopal Hands. It may be, our Author, when drawing up his Indict∣ment of <HI>New-England,</HI> was either a Stranger or inad∣vertent to that part of our History, which relates to the doleful Scenes of Confusion, Persecution and Op∣pression, that <HI>New-England</HI> saw in the days of Sir <HI>Ed∣mund Andross,</HI> a Governour of <HI>his own Communion:</HI> who, with four or five of his Council (Men of the <HI>same</HI> Principles) by the most arbitrary Proceedings harrass'd and enslav'd the Country; invading Liberty and Property, and threatning a Desolation of all our Rights and Privileges Civil and Ecclesiastical. Ar∣mies they levy'd, Laws they made, Taxes they rais'd on the People, and did what else they pleas'd, <HI>with∣out the Advice of an Assembly.</HI> Some worthy Persons, having in an humble Address represented this Pro∣ceeding as a Grievance, were committed to the com∣mon Jail for a High Misdemeanour; deny'd the Be∣nefit of the <HI>Hebeas Corpus</HI> Act; try'd out of their County; fin'd exorbitantly (some 20, 30, 50 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>) and oblig'd to pay 160 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for Fees, when the Prosecution would hardly have cost them so many Shillings under a just Administration. And when upon their Trial they claim'd the Privileges of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> they were insulted and scoffingly told, <HI>Those things would not follow them to the Ends of the Earth.—</HI> Their Title to their Lands was absolutely deny'd by the Governour and his Creatures, upon trifling Pretences! So that they who had fairly purchas'd their Lands, and held them in quiet Possession for above fifty Years, were now oblig'd to accept new Deeds or Patents from the Governour, and pay for them a third part of their Va∣lue, in order to ascertain their Titles, or otherwise they would be seiz'd for the Crown.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummer</HI>'s Defence of the <HI>N.

<PB N="32" REF="003651_0019_10023C1E2F638010"/>in like a Tide, and bore down every thing before it. There were <HI>Standing Forces,</HI> to keep the Country in Awe; a Crew, that were ever moving Tumults, and committing insufferable Riots amongst a quiet and peaceable People; and that without Redress upon frequent Complaints. The Governour had said, upon Occasion, That <HI>it wou'd be for the Kings's Interest, for this People to be remov'd, and another introduc'd:</HI> and there were several Things, which made it suspected, that <HI>Sir E</HI> (carrying on secret Intreagues with the Indians) had conducted 7 or 800 of our Soldiers into the Eastern Wilderness in the depth of Winter, on purpose to sacrifice them there. Some of the <HI>princi∣pal Gentlemen</HI> of the Country were imprison'd, bound to the Behaviour, and cruelly squeez'd by the De∣mands of <HI>Cormorant</HI> Messengers and Officers, and all without any Accusation, but meerly upon a Jealousy that they joyn'd in the common Complaint of these Grievances. Some of our old <HI>Magistrates</HI> were put in Jail without any Fault laid to their Charge, and there kept for several Months. Some of our <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> were grievously persecuted; a Process commenc'd against one for a Book publish'd long enough before <HI>Sir E.</HI> arriv'd in <HI>New-England.</HI> — Another accus'd of seditious Preaching, dragg'd out of his County to be try'd, because there (where he was best known) a Pannel could not be got wicked enough to ruine him on the single Testimony of one debauch'd Person, con∣tradicted by he whole Assembly that heard the Ser∣mon. The scrupled Mode of laying the Hand on the Bible in taking an Oath was then impos'd<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willard's</HI> Discourse concerning that Ceremony.</NOTE>; and ma∣ny holy and worthy Men suffer'd for refusing it. The Church-Party demanding the Keys of the South Meet∣ing House in <HI>Boston,</HI> and being refus'd, the Governour threaten'd, <HI>He would presently seize on that House, and all the Meeting Houses in the Country, and hinder the People from contributing the value of Two-pence toward

But this not prevailing, the Consequence was, they thrust themselves into the <HI>South Meeting House;</HI> and there continu'd, until by interrupting that Congregation, often in their <HI>Times,</HI> sometimes in the very <HI>Parts</HI> of their Worship, the whole Town cry'd Shame upon 'em; them they tho't of <HI>building.</HI> Some of our People contributed to∣wards it: — But can the Townsmen of <HI>Boston</HI> tell, at whose Charge the <HI>Land</HI> (part of one of their Burying-places) was purchased?

And had not the ever-memorable REVOLUTION defeated the Purposes of those unhappy Men, very probably <HI>New-England</HI> had soon been a Stage for the same bloody Tragedies, to be acted over, as were seen in our Mother-Country in those days of common Distress to Protestant Dissenters. Thus we have ba∣lanc'd the Account relating to <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> goes on, with a more extended Charge, against the Dissenters <HI>in general.</HI> <Q>Episco∣pacy they abolished, murdered two <HI>Arch-Bishops,</HI> defaced, abused, demolished Churches, the Clergy many thousands in Number, they imprisoned, plun∣dered, ejected, &amp;c.</Q> Let us consider this something particularly. Was <HI>Episcopacy</HI> abolished? Let my Lord <HI>Digby</HI> in his fore-mentioned Speech in the House of <HI>Commons,</HI> furnish us with a Reason for that Conduct: <Q>I (says that noble Lord) find my self wil∣ling to have them passed by (i. e. the Faults in the Petitions against the Bishops, then before the House) especially when I consider, how naturally prone all
<PB N="34" REF="003651_0020_10023C3903B40B38"/>Mankind is, when it finds it self oppressed beyond all Patience, to fly into Extreams for Ease; and in∣deed I do not think any People hath been ever more provoked, than the genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty of <HI>England</HI> of late years, by the Insolencies and Exorbitancies of the Prelates.</Q></P>
<P>But who were the two <HI>Arch-Bishops</HI> they murdered? I suppose he means <HI>Arch Bishop Laud,</HI> and <HI>Arch-Bishop Sharp.</HI> The first of these was the chief <HI>Bou∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eu</HI> and Incendiary, in all those horrible Flames of <HI>Persecution,</HI> by which the Nation was so severely scorch'd; on which account, he was impeached and condemned by the <HI>Parliament,</HI> for his horrible <HI>Bar∣barities</HI> and Oppression; for his Infraction of all our Liberties and Privileges; and for the violations of all Laws, divine and humane. I shall not dispute with this Gentleman, the Justice of his Sentence; nor the Authority by which he fell. But the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are no more accountable for his Death, than they are for all the State-Tryals, that have ever occurred. And as for the second of these <HI>Arch-Bishops,</HI> the perfidious and barbarous Persecutor <HI>Sharp,</HI> he fell a Martyr to his own inhuman Cruelties, by the Hands of enraged Assassins. But were the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> guilty of his Murder? Can this Gentleman prove, that there was so much as one Man, acknowledged by the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that was concerned in his Death<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? There were indeed five Presbyterians put to Death, on the Account of this Murder: but as it was never <HI>proved</HI> against them, so they in some of the last Words that ever they spoke, ventured their Eternity upon their <HI>Innocence.</HI> And who was guilty of their Murder, God will judge. But this Gentleman has doubtless heard of <HI>Matchiavel's</HI> Advice, <HI>Fortiter calumniare, aliquid haerebit.</HI></P>
<P>He next charges us with <HI>defacing, abusing, and de∣molishing Churches.</HI> By <HI>defacing Churches,</HI> he may possibly mean the destroying as Fonts, Organs, Altars, and the like, so <HI>Images,</HI> the Scandalous Images, then
<PB N="35" REF="003651_0020_10023C3903B40B38"/>set up in their <HI>Protestant</HI> Churches; such as that at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which represented God the Father, under the Form of an old Man, towards which an old Wo∣man used to make a Cursey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pierce's</HI> Vindic. p. 202.</NOTE>; and the <HI>Roods,</HI> that is the Images of <HI>Christ</HI> upon the <HI>Cross,</HI> with <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>John</HI> standing by; as also <HI>Images</HI> of other Saints, Tutelaries of the Churches, to which they were dedi∣cated.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 201.</NOTE> That the Churches were thus defaced, is cer∣tain; and the Nonconformists have no Cause to be a∣shamed of the Imputation, had it been done by them. And it must also be acknowleged, that there were other sad Devastations made, in the time of the <HI>Civil Wars;</HI> and who could expect any better, from the Heat of <HI>military</HI> Fury? But it was as much out of the Power of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as of the <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> to prevent this, and all the other amazing Conse∣quences of that intestine War. Let them thank those that gave <HI>Occasion</HI> to the War, for all the Miseries that it brought upon them.</P>
<P>We are also charg'd with <HI>imprisoning, plundering, ejecting the Clergy, many Thousands in number &amp;c.—</HI> Now the true State of that Case is this. As for the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and the <HI>Cathedral</HI> Clergy, they suffer'd, as such, upon the Extirpation of the Hierarchy; which was done by a <HI>conformable</HI> Parlia∣ment; the Members of which were many of them known to be in their Judgment for the ancient mode∣rate Episcopacy, and all of them (a very few only excepted) in Communion with the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> Church and Dissenters compar'd, as to Persecution, p. 35, 28. <HI>Pierce's</HI> Vind. p. 204.</NOTE>.

We do not justify it, but lament it, that several learned and pious Ministers were then turn'd out: tho' they were not <HI>so many</HI> as is pretended by our Adversaries, who have lately stretch'd their Wits and (I fear) their Consciences too, to increase their Number<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pierce's</HI> Vind.

If they were <HI>Thousands,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="003651_0021_10023C086EA29170"/>yet surely not <HI>many</HI> Thousands. It's true, Dr. <HI>Walker,</HI> in his <HI>Attempt</HI> to recover the Names and Sufferings of the sequestred Clergy, guesses that there were <HI>Ten Thousand</HI> Sufferers on the Church-Side; but after all his Blustring, his <HI>List</HI> makes out little more than a <HI>fifth part</HI> of that Number: and Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> (in his Answer to him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Church and Dissenters compar'd. p. 53 &amp;c.</NOTE>) by a fair Computation reduces the Number still lower, and makes it probably fall short of the Number of Nonconformists that suffer'd by the <HI>Act of Uniformity;</HI> instead of so vastly exceeding it, as is oft asserted, and so commonly believ'd.— And then as to <HI>rigorous Treatment,</HI> the Doctor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 57.</NOTE> observes there is this difference very discernible: that the Severities which are most complained of on the Church-Side, were the Effects of <HI>Civil</HI> Discords; whereas the Suf∣ferings on our side were mostly upon a <HI>Religious</HI> Ac∣count, which made them the more cutting. The Parliament (says he) dealt severely with many of the Clergy, it is true: but then they did it not so much because they were <HI>Episcopalians</HI> in their Judgments, as because they oppos'd them in their Practices, and assisted their bitter Enemies. But still many that shew'd a Disposition to live peaceably, remain'd unmolested. Many went on using the Liturgy and Ceremonies, not∣withstanding the rigour of the Times.— Many Epis∣copal Men held their Livings in all those Times, and were never sequestred or ejected, tho' their Livings were of good Value; or if put out of one Living, they soon got into another as good or better<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 44, 68, 71, 81.</NOTE>.

<P>Thus, Sir, you have seen, what Grounds our Author had, to draw up this heavy Impeachment against the Dissenters. And I think you will agree, that we may safely put the Case upon the Issue proposed by him; and leave it to others to determine, which Party are enti∣tled to the <HI>Character of the true Church, by their Suf∣ferings;</HI> and so conclude this historical Debate in his own Words, <HI>Let the World judge, if I have not fairly detected this Gentleman's Partiality, at his first setting out.</HI></P>
<P>HAving thus particularly considered his Charge of <HI>Persecution,</HI> it is Time now to attend upon what he has further to say, in Answer to the <HI>Dia∣logue.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman seems to be startled at the Terms <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Impositions;</HI> which, he tells us, are <HI>Words of direful Import, being feigned and imaginary Scarecrows</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Script. Bp. Exam. p. 4.</NOTE> But why is he thus frighten'd with the Words, when so conversant with what is signified by them? Are there no <HI>Ceremonies</HI> in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> imposed as Terms of Communion? Have there been none kept out of the Church, refused Ad∣mission to sealing Ordinances, and excommunicated <HI>ipso Facto,</HI> by the Canons of that Church, for non-compliance with those Ceremonies? What then can he mean by inquiring, <HI>What are those Laws I fix this odious Brand upon, and call by the Nick Name of Im∣positions?</HI> — But to satisfy him, I'll tell him <HI>what
<PB N="41" REF="003651_0023_10023C3B844B7108"/>Laws</HI> I refer to. — That <HI>Law,</HI> which requires our Acknowlegement of the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> as con∣taining nothing in it repugnant to the Scriptures, up∣on Pain of Excommunication.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canon IV.</NOTE> — That <HI>Law,</HI> that declares us excommunicated <HI>ipso Facto,</HI> if we don't ac∣knowledge, that the Rites and Ceremonies of the <HI>Church of England</HI> are such, as we may with good Conscience approve, use, or subscribe to<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Can.

<P>His curious Panegyrick, upon these <HI>good Orders and Constitutions of the Church,</HI> as he calls 'em, will hardly persuade any rational Man to a good Opinion of 'em, till he can first shew us, by what Authority the <HI>Church of England,</HI> or any other Church under Heaven, can assume the Character of that <HI>one Lawgiver, who only can save or destroy;</HI> and take from us <HI>the Liberty, where∣with Christ has made us free.</HI> Let this Author, if he can, offer one Argument for these <HI>Impositions,</HI> that can't with the same Propriety be urged in favour of the <HI>Spanish Inquisition.</HI> He says, that "enough hath been said, by our own and foreign Divines, to remove the Imputation." And I in Answer assert, that enough hath been said, not only by our own, but by all the
<PB N="42" REF="003651_0024_10023BEBF9F81680"/>most noted foreign Divines, in the beginning of the Reformation, to justify &amp; <HI>fix</HI> the Imputation immove∣ably for ever.</P>
<P>But why are the <HI>foreign Divines</HI> pressed into his Ser∣vice? Can they be supposed to join with him in de∣claring the <HI>non-entity of those unhappy People's Church, that want episcopal Ordination,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Script. Bp. examined, p. 51.</NOTE> and so unchurch themselves and us together, to gratify this Party? No Sir, both the Discipline and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> were very <HI>disagreable</HI> to the most emi∣nent <HI>foreign Divines,</HI> from the Beginning; as appears by their declared Sentiments, and by the many Letters to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to the Bishops and Nobility of <HI>England</HI> and others, against these Things, written by <HI>Calvin, Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lter, Bullinger, Beza, Zan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> and others; which you may see fairly represented in Mr. <HI>Neal</HI>'s History of the <HI>Puritans.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal,</HI> p. 113, 124, 197, 198, 199, 273, 281, &amp; alibi.</NOTE>. Emphatical are the Words of <HI>Beza</HI> and seventeen other Divines, in a Letter dated October 24 1564. who say, <Q>If the Case was theirs, they would not receive the Ministry upon these Conditions (the Terms imposed by the Church of Eng∣land) if it were proferred; much less would they sue for it. As for those who have hitherto compli∣ed, if they are obliged not only to wink at manifest Abuses; but to approve of those Things that ought to be redressed, what Thing else can we advise them to, but that they should retire to a private Life.—As for the <HI>Popish Habits,</HI> those Men that are Authors of their being imposed, do deserve most evil of the Church, and shall verily answer it, at the dreadful Bar of Christ's Judgment<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid</HI> p. 199.</NOTE>.</Q> By which you may see, what Reason this Gentleman has to quote the <HI>foreign Divines</HI> in his Favour; and what Reason, to conclude this remarkable Paragraph, with a Charge upon us, or <HI>continuing and propagating Schism.</HI></P>
<P>I am content, that they bear this Imputation of <HI>Schism,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="003651_0024_10023BEBF9F81680"/>to whom it most properly belongs; whether they, that unchurch all the Protestant Churches but themselves, for want of episcopal Ordination, and that impose those unscriptural and (as themselves confess) unnecessary Institutions upon their Brethren, as Terms of Com∣munion; or they, who peaceably reject these Rem∣nants of Popery, because they cannot conform to 'em, without wounding their Consciences, and sinning a∣gainst God. Whether these things are in themselves lawful or not, which occasion the Division, is not in the Question. They are certainly unlawful to us; because against our Consciences.</P>
<P>For this Gentleman's Diversion, I'll venture to en∣tertain him with a short Story, and leave him to apply it. A serious Gentlewoman was so unhappy, as to think it unlawful to eat <HI>blood Pudding,</HI> a Food which her Husband was greatly delighted in. Her Husband requires her upon Pain of his highest Displeasure, to eat with him, assuring her that it's lawful, tho' not ne∣cessary, for her to do it. She desires to be excused, lets him know that it's against her Conscience, and (she thinks) against the plain Command of God, to eat Blood, promises Observance in every Thing she can oblige him in, consistent with a good Conscience towards God. He insists upon her Conformity, threat∣ens to beat out her Brains; and actually drives her out of the House, for her non-compliance; and so a sad <HI>Schism</HI> is made in the Family. I desire to know, which of 'em was chargeable with the Guilt of this <HI>Schism.</HI></P>
<P>If we consider this Case, with a particular Applicati∣on to <HI>our own</HI> Country, <HI>who</HI> are the <HI>Schismaticks?</HI> They, that have kept close to the <HI>first Principles</HI> of the Coun∣try; and have maintained the Worship of God in pu∣rity and Peace, agreable to the Laws of <HI>God</HI> and the Laws of <HI>the Land,</HI> without imposing their Opinions upon any Man's Conscience? Or they, that are not content with the <HI>Liberty</HI> of bringing in their unscrip∣tural Innovations; but must needs be <HI>obtruding</HI> them as necessary to Salvation, and declaring, with this ve∣ry
<PB N="44" REF="003651_0025_10023C2251AC46D8"/>charitable Gentleman,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scripture Bishop examined, <HI>p 51, 52.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Nonentity</HI> of our Churches, and that the <HI>Difference between us is not a Difference in Circumstantials; but a Priesthood or no Priesthood, a Church or no Church?</HI> If <HI>Schism,</HI> implies making of Divisions and Rents in the Church, I de∣sire this Party would clear themselves of it; or else we must leave the <HI>Brat</HI> at the Door of its proper Father.</P>
<P>Before I dismiss this Head, I can't but take Notice of his so frequently and satyrically giving us the Ap∣pellation of DISSENTERS. But I pray who is it that <HI>dissent</HI> from the original and legal Establishment of the Country, they, or we? It were every whit a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Sense, to call the <HI>German, Dutch, French,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other foreign Churches <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as to give us in <HI>New-England</HI> that Denomination.</P>
<P>OUR Author undertakes <Q>next (as he tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 5.</NOTE>) t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> examine the Reasons (in the <HI>Dialogue</HI>) so chusing Ordination by a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> rather than by <HI>diocesan Bishop.</HI></Q> And he first pretends to an Ex∣amination of <HI>this</HI> Reason of our Opinion, <HI>That ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Jesus Christ has inhibited all Dominion and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣premacy among the Ministers of the Gospel, over one a∣nother &amp;c.</HI> But what does he say to this? What An∣swer does he give, to the several Scriptures cited i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> that in express Terms forbid this im∣pleaded Supremacy among the Ministers of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pel? Not one single Word! He has left the Argu∣ments as he found them, safe in our Hands, with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> implicit Acknowledgement, that their ecclesiastical Supremacy is indefensible.</P>
<P>He proceeds however to manifest his Willingne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to wipe off the Imputation, of <HI>Lording it over God's H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ritage,</HI> from their <HI>Bishops.</HI> But I cannot discover a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Pertinency in his Reasonings. He tells us, <Q>All the
<PB N="45" REF="003651_0025_10023C2251AC46D8"/><HI>Bishops</HI> in the World, except the <HI>Pope,</HI> do disclaim it.</Q> But why is the <HI>Pope</HI> excepted? Don't he dis∣claim it too? Did he ever confess his Guilt? — But whoever disclaim it, I can't think it a sufficient Evi∣dence of Innocence, to plead not Guilty.</P>
<P>He goes on to prove, by a variety of Scriptures, that there is a Power and Authority belonging to the Rulers of the Church; and that the Exercise of that Authori∣ty is not a <HI>Lording it over God's Heritage.</HI> But what is this to the Purpose? Who ever disputed this Autho∣rity, or the lawful Exercise of it?</P>
<P>He moreover assures us, that <Q>the Power and Au∣thority of our <HI>Bishops</HI> is falsely suggested to be <HI>Lording it over God's Heritage,</HI> they have enacted no Laws of their own, that exceed their Commission, and the Apostolical Rule, of having all Things done decently and in Order.</Q> This I confess is to the Purpose; and if he could have given good Evidence of it, 'twould have done our Business effectually. But I suspect, there will remain nothing but his bare Word to support his Cause, when throughly examin'd.</P>
<P>Have they <HI>enacted no Laws of their own, that exceed∣ed their Commission!</HI> But who gave them Commission, to impose any <HI>Laws</HI> at all, upon the Subjects of the Lord Jesus Christ? <HI>The Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our King.</HI> I have already shewn, that they have enacted a great Number of severe <HI>Laws,</HI> which they have enjoined with the greatest Penalties they could annex to 'em. But I still enquire, by what Authority? If the Lord Jesus Christ has given Power to his Church to make <HI>Laws,</HI> every Church have equal Claim to this legisla∣tive Faculty: And how then will this Gentleman justi∣fy the <HI>Reformation?</HI> May not the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> use this Authority, given them by Christ, as well as the Church of <HI>England?</HI> If he answers to this, that the papal Laws are unscriptural, and therefore beyond their Commission: I reply, so are the Laws of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Now, who must be Judge in this Case. If
<PB N="46" REF="003651_0026_10023C24444FA340"/>we are referred to the Church for a Decision, <HI>Protes∣tantism</HI> in general, as well as <HI>Presbytery,</HI> must fall be∣fore this Tryal. And what is worse than this, we must necessarily submit to the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, of the <HI>Armenian, Georgian, Mingrellian</HI> Churches; and in a Word, of all the Churches in the World. For if the Decision belong to the <HI>Church,</HI> it belongs to one Church as well as another; and besure every one will determine in their own Favour. And thus Light and Darkness, Truth and Error, and the most contradicto∣ry Sentiments in the World, must be blended toge∣ther; and every Man must be of every Opinion.—If he appeals to the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to determine this Matter, we are ready to join Issue with him, upon that Foot. But then, who must <HI>interpret</HI> the Scriptures for us, in this Case? If we are allowed the Use of our own Under∣standings, the Scriptures are on our Side the Question. If the <HI>Church</HI> may impose her Interpretations of Scrip∣ture, all the forementioned Difficulties recur. For <HI>every</HI> Church pretends to found her Authority upon the Scriptures. Nor will it do, for this Gentleman to plead, that <HI>other Churches</HI> are in the wrong, and the <HI>Church of England</HI> in the Right. For they will retort the Argument, with as much Justice and as good As∣surance, as he can have. His only Way therefore, to avoid these Consequences, is to produce a Commission for the <HI>Church of England,</HI> EXCLUSIVE of all other Churches, to make these <HI>Laws,</HI> and enforce them; otherwise all Pretences to a <HI>legislative</HI> Authority, will sound very odly, from those that disclaim <HI>Infallibility.</HI></P>
<P>We have this Gentleman's Word for it, that <HI>these Injunctions are falsely suggested, to be Lording it over God's Heritage.</HI> To which I answer; They have of∣ten enough heard, that our Consciences tell us (after the best Enquiry we can make) that they are contra∣ry to the <HI>Laws</HI> of Christ; and yet they are neverthe∣less enjoin'd with all their Penalties. What then can be done? Here is the Authority of <HI>Christ</HI> on the one Hand, and <HI>their</HI> Authority on the other. By the best Light
<PB N="47" REF="003651_0026_10023C24444FA340"/>we can get, to obey them is to disobey the Lord Jesus Christ. If they say, our Consciences are <HI>weak</HI> and er∣ring, it's the same thing: for <HI>to him that esteemeth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean,</HI> Rom. xiv. 14. <HI>He that doubts, is damned, if he eat,</HI> ver. 23. and <HI>by this a weak Conscience is defiled,</HI> 1 Cor. viii. 7. As we can make our appeal to the righteous Judge, before whom we must finally answer for our Conduct, that we sin∣cerely endeavour Obedience to him, in the contested Articles; so we chearfully appeal to the World, whe∣ther it ben't an unjustifiable <HI>Lordship,</HI> thus to endea∣vour <HI>to destroy those, for whom Christ died.</HI>—Who im∣powered them <HI>to judge their Brother, or to set at nought their Brother?</HI> (Rom. xiv. 10.) Or to <HI>put a Stumbling Block, or Occasion to fall, in their Brother's way?</HI> (verse 13.) Is this <HI>to bear the Infirmity of the weak,</HI> (as these Engrossers of all Wisdom are pleased to call as) or is it <HI>to please themselves?</HI> (Rom. xv. 1.) Is this <HI>to receive one another, as Christ also received us, to the Glory of God?</HI> (ver. 7.) — Methinks better Ar∣guments, or less Assurance, would very well become our Tory Friends, in the Case before us.</P>
<P>I am next to consider what Grounds this Author has for all his Banter and Railery<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pag. 6, 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> at the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> for asserting it to be a <HI>natural Right,</HI> for a People to <HI>com∣mit</HI> their most important Affairs, to one that they can <HI>approve;</HI> and that the Imposing their Ministers upon Congregations is a <HI>Lordship,</HI> that the <HI>Apostles</HI> them∣selves would not use, in supplying the Vacancy made by the Death of <HI>Judas;</HI> and in the Election of <HI>Dea∣cons.</HI> To which he answers, <Q>This Gentleman would do well to consider, that we are not now in a State of Nature, but of Grace; and he would find it per∣haps no easy Task, to describe his State of Nature, and what particular Powers Men in that supposed State, have a just Claim to.</Q> I would not willingly overlook this Argument, if I could any ways find
<PB N="48" REF="003651_0027_10023BE42840BBB8"/>out what the Gentleman would prove by it. I can hardly think he means, that all his Party are in <HI>a State of Grace,</HI> in the same sense that the Apostle uses a like Phrase, in <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 14. Because I believe that he himself will own, that there are some few of 'em un∣der the <HI>Dominion of Sin.</HI> But perhaps he may intend (for I can but guess at his Meaning) that the Grace of the Gospel has made void the Law of Nature; and we are no longer to regard the Dictates of it. If thus, he is so unhappy, as to have the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> for his Adversary, in this case, Rom. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. <HI>Do we then make void the Law thro' Faith? God forbid; yea we esta∣blish the Law.</HI> I think all are agreed, that 'tis the mo∣ral Law, or the Law of Nature, that the Apostle re∣fers to, and I never before heard any one call into Question that received Maxim, <HI>The Law of Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Law of God.</HI> But whatever his Meaning may be, I yet insist upon it, that a People have a <HI>natural Right</HI> to chuse their own Minister. For how ignorant soever he would make us, of the State of Nature I plead for, I am sure every one must own, that it's one of the first Dictates of Nature, <HI>to take Care of our Selves;</HI> and that our Care should be proportioned to the Weight and Importance of the Concern before us: Whence it ne∣cessarily follows, that as I have a natural Right to chuse what Food shall be provided for my <HI>Body,</HI> and reject such as is unwholsome or poysonous, in order to the Preservation of my Life, so am I much more concerned to take the like care of my <HI>Soul,</HI> that it be indeed fed with the Food of Life, and not destroy'd o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rendred unhealthy, by the Ignorance, Errors, Scandals or other Insufficiency of my Minister.— Besides, if have a natural Right <HI>to judge for my self,</HI> in the af∣fairs of my eternal safety, and must stand or fall at last by my own Opinion and Conduct, and not by another Man's; I have equally a natural Right to chuse the <HI>Means,</HI> that I think most conducive to my eternal well-being, and cannot be determined by any other Person, against my own Opinion and Conscience.
<PB N="49" REF="003651_0027_10023BE42840BBB8"/>add, if the Power of imposing a Minister upon a Peo∣ple be allow'd to belong to the <HI>Superiour Officers</HI> of any Church, it must be allow'd to belong to the Su∣perior Officers of <HI>every</HI> Church, and the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> may claim it, as well as the Church of <HI>England;</HI> unless the <HI>English Bishops</HI> can shew a Commission, <HI>ex∣clusiue</HI> of all but themselves, to impose their Minister upon a People: and thus they have no Right to refuse Subjection to a <HI>popish Priest</HI> as their Minister, who live in <HI>popish</HI> Countries.</P>
<P>Our Author's Endeavours to prove, that the Apostle <HI>Matthias</HI> was not chosen by the <HI>Suffrages</HI> of the Lai∣ty, are altogether impertinent; for who ever pretend∣ed it? I grant, that an <HI>Apostle</HI> receiv'd his Cha∣racter, <HI>not of Man, nor by Men; but</HI> immediately <HI>by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the Dead.</HI> And yet, the <HI>Suffrage</HI> of the whole visible Church then present (which consisted of but a hundred and twenty Persons, as appears from <HI>Acts</HI> i. 15.) was taken, in supplying the Vacancy made by the Death of <HI>Judas,</HI> not for <HI>chusing an Apostle,</HI> but for <HI>appointing two qualified Persons;</HI> out of which one was to be set apart, by the immediate Voice of Providence, unto that sacred Character: and accordingly we are told, that <HI>they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was Surnamed Justus, and Matthias,</HI> Acts i. 23. Tho' the Character of an <HI>Apostle</HI> made it necessary, that he should have an immediate Call to his Office; yet the whole Christian Church, being concerned and inte∣rested in the Qualifications of this publick Officer, they are all consulted in the Case, and have such a Voice in it, that the Person when appointed, cannot be dis∣agreable to 'em. This is plain Matter of Fact: and this solemn Transaction in the very Infancy of the Chris∣tian Institution, is a <HI>standing Pattern</HI> to the Churches, thro' all succeeding Ages, in that Respect.</P>
<P>And as to the seven <HI>Deacons,</HI> if it be possible that any Thing can be fully and clearly represented by Words, we are certain, that they were chosen by
<PB N="50" REF="003651_0028_10023C01EEC1FC68"/>the Church: <HI>Wherefore Brethren (say the Apostles,) lock ye out among you, seven Men of honest Report, full of the Holy Ghost and Wisdom, whom we may appoint over this Business: and the Saying pleased the whole Multitude; and they CHOSE Stephen, a Man full of Faith and the Holy Ghost, and Philip,</HI> &amp;c. Acts vi. 3, 5. I am surprized to find this Gentleman asserting, <Q>that it doth not at all appear, that the Apostles counted this a Priviledge of the People; but the contrary; because the People claimed no such <HI>Right;</HI> but did it in Obedience to the Apostles.</Q> — But it's certain, whether the People <HI>claimed</HI> that Right or not, it <HI>was</HI> their Right, a <HI>Right</HI> allowed them by the <HI>Holy-Ghost,</HI> under whose Guidance the <HI>Apostles</HI> were in this their Conduct, and by whom the People were not in∣dulged in an unjustifiable Usurpation.—And how does it at all affect the Case, that <Q>the Apostles reserved to themselves the Right of <HI>appointing</HI> these Dea∣cons to their Office?</Q> The Question is not about the <HI>Ordination</HI> (which is all that is meant by the Apostles <HI>appointing</HI> them, as appears from ver. 3. com∣pared with ver. 6.) but about the <HI>Election,</HI> of these Church-Officers. They were <HI>chosen</HI> by the <HI>Multitude,</HI> if the sacred Text may be credited; which is all I plead for. And I mistake, if our Author does not in effect give up the Cause, when he allows that the <Q>nomination of Persons is put on the People, and that this was the Apostolical Practice.</Q> But how he will prove the "practice of the Church of <HI>England</HI> consist∣ent with this," I am at a Loss.</P>
<P>I might further observe, if the original of the Text in <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23. were duely noticed, it will appear, that the People had constantly the Liberty of chusing their Ministers, allowed them by the Apostles themselves. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Which <HI>Beza</HI> in his latin Version, justly renders, <HI>Quum{que} ipsi per Suffragia creassent per singulas Eccl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Presbyteros. And when them had by Votes constituted Presbyters in every Church.</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="003651_0028_10023C01EEC1FC68"/>It can't be deny'd, that the Greek Word in this Text, signifies chusing by lifting up of Hands. Whence it's a necessary Consequence, that this was the Method of chusing Ministers in these Churches, under the Di∣rection of the Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> which therefore ought yet to be retain'd, by all that would follow the Divine Pattern. This it seems, the <HI>Tran∣slators</HI> of our <HI>Bibles</HI> were convinced of. For as we are told by a very learned Man, <Q>Our English Bibles them∣selves, until they had undergone Episcopal Correc∣tion, at this Text, put in the Words <HI>by Election;</HI> and the Margin had this Note, The Apostles did not thrust Pastors into the Church, thro' a lordly Superiority; but chose, and placed them, by the Voice of the Congregation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ratio Disciplinae, <HI>p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>To all which I may add, that all who are acquaint∣ed with the Fathers and ancient Councils, must ac∣knowledge, that in the primitive Church the Exercise of the Ministry depended upon the Election of the People; which was in <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Time, esteemed as a divine Tradition: that Father assures us, <HI>That the Peo∣ple hath the chief Power of chusing worthy Ministers, and refusing the unworthy.</HI> To which he adds, <HI>That it must be received as a divine Tradition, and an Apostolical Observation; and that it was observed among them, and almost in all the Provinces, that for the right Perfor∣mance of Ordination, the neighbouring Bishops meet to∣gether with that Congregation or People, for whom a Ruler is to be ordained; and the Bishop is chosen in the Presence of the People, who have most perfect Knowledge of the Life of every one, and have strictly observed their manner of Conversation.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plebs ipsa maxime habet Potes∣tatem vel eligendi dignos Sacerdotes vel indignos recuf∣andi &amp;c. <HI>Ep.</HI> 68.</NOTE> It would too much swell this Letter, to multiply Quotations of the like Kind. And I can't but flatter my self, that I have already said enough to convince any one,
<PB N="52" REF="003651_0029_10023BDCF0B4A4A8"/>of the gross mistake of our Author, in his confident, Assertion, that <Q>we want such Precedents, as may support the Right of the People, to chuse their Minister.</Q> And yet, I must confess on the other Hand, that our Adversaries do not want Precedents, to support the Imposing their Minister on a People, without their Consent, since the <HI>papal</HI> Usurpations have obtained; tho' they might be at a Loss to find any <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, I think I have fully discharged the Debt, contracted at the Beginning of this Discourse; and obviated this Author's Fleers at the <HI>Platform so Church Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>But we are told, that <Q>we all know that the Rebellion of <HI>Corah</HI> and his Company, was occa∣sioned by <HI>Aaron</HI>'s having the High-Priesthood conferred upon him, which <HI>Corah</HI> endeavoured to obtain for himself, by that popular Tumult</Q>— How I pray, are we affected with this pretty Witti∣cism? Do we pretend to the <HI>High Priesthood,</HI> as <HI>Corah</HI> did? Do we insist that our <HI>Ministry is pro∣perly sacerdotal,</HI> that our <HI>Bishops</HI> succeed to the <HI>High-Priest,</HI> our <HI>Presbyters</HI> to the <HI>Priests,</HI> and our <HI>Deacons</HI> to the <HI>Levites?</HI> Do we professedly thrust Men into the sacred Office, without a divine Appointment, to invade the Province of those Officers, that God him∣self has appointed in his Church, as <HI>Corah</HI> would have done? Does this Gentleman find our Ecclesi∣astical Affairs put into the Hands of <HI>Suffragans, Arch Deacons, Deans, Chancellors, Commissaries, Proctors, Apparitors,</HI> &amp;c. Officers confessedly not of Divine Right? If he can make out these Things a∣gainst us, we will acknowledge the Justice of the Imputation, and have no Recourse to <HI>Novels</HI> or <HI>Coun∣cils,</HI> or other human Warrant: but acknowledge our∣selves <HI>Corahites,</HI> for thrusting Officers into the Church, without a divine Commission, and committing the Work to them, that belongs to the Ministers of Christ, by his own Institution.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="003651_0029_10023BDCF0B4A4A8"/>
A like Answer may be made to his Reasoning from 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 3, 4. against the People's Right to chuse their own Ministers. The Apostle there plainly points at the <HI>Roman Apostacy,</HI> at their <HI>heaping up Teachers</HI> of their own devising, such as would best tickle their <HI>itching Ears,</HI> by forsaking the Truth, and entertaining them with fabulous Doctrines; which has been remarkably fulfilled in that Synagogue of Satan. Let them therefore apply this Text to them∣selves whose Clergy come nearest to the <HI>Roman Hi∣erarchy.</HI> If we have been prompted by our itching Ears, to imitate the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in heaping up to our selves Lords <HI>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans, Prebends, Arch Deacons. Vicars, Curates,</HI> and other such Teachers, that the Scriptures know nothing of, we will own the Gentleman's Charge, that we have no be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Precedent, than the Prediction in the quoted Text. But in the Interim, we may justly despise his groundless Merriment on this Oocasion.</P>
<P>I Will next try, if I can't send that <HI>Spirit</HI> to haunt this Gentleman and his Party, which (p. 10) he says <HI>I have conjured up, and is not in my Power to lay.</HI> The frightful <HI>Hobgoblin</HI> is this Argument, proposed by <HI>Prelaticus</HI> in the Dialogue. — <HI>Ordination by Bi∣shops is certainly of Divine Institution; for Bishops are Presbyters, if they have no higher Character; and therefore upon your own Principles, have Power of Ordination: whereas Ordination by Presbyters is at least questionable; and therefore ours must be allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>be the safest Side.</HI> To which darling Plea of that Party, were several Answers given. They were first shewn, that both the <HI>Baptists</HI> and the <HI>Papists</HI> claim equal Advantage by this Way of arguing. That the <HI>Baptis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> plead, we own their [kind of] <HI>Baptism</HI> is valid, while they deny that Sorinkling an Infant is any <HI>Baptism</HI> at all; and therefore they must be of the safer
<PB N="54" REF="003651_0030_1002024756E0CFC0"/>Side: And that the <HI>Papists</HI> argue after the same Manner, that all own, Salvation may be obtain'd in the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but they deny the Possibility of the Salvation of <HI>Protestants;</HI> and therefore the <HI>Papists</HI> are of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer Side. Unto this our Author under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answer particularly; and his first Answer to the Plea of the <HI>Baptists,</HI> is truly very remarkable.</P>
<P><Q>And whence pray (says he) received he his In∣formation, that the <HI>Church of England</HI> allows the Validity of Baptism, administred by <HI>Baptists?</HI> No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Articles, Canons, and Rubricks of the Church; for they declare the Baptism of <HI>Laick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to be invalid, I by requiring a Lawful Administra∣tor: and notwithstanding the great Pains take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to prove the divine Right of Presbyterian Ordina∣tion, I must still for Want of fuller Conviction level dissenting Teachers of all Denominations, in the same Rank with <HI>Laicks.</HI></Q> — This, I must con∣fess, is plain Dealing. <HI>The Baptism of Laicks is in∣valid. The dissenting Teachers of all Denomination</HI> (that is, all those that want Episcopal Ordination) <HI>are but Laicks:</HI> whence it must be the sad State of all the poor <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>France, Holland, Switser land, Geneva, Germany, Transylvania, Polonia, Bo∣hemia,</HI> &amp;c. as well as <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> to be unbaptized Persons, and (as one of this Author's Brethren expresses it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dodwel,</HI> Ono Priesthood, Chap. xiii. Sect 14.</NOTE> Aliens from God &amp; Christ, Strangers to the Covenant of Promise, and the Com∣mon wealth of Israel. And what makes our Case the more deplorable, is, that it's remediless. For the <HI>foreign Churches</HI> have no Ministers, that are episco∣pally ordained; and consequently cannot obtain <HI>Episcopal Baptism</HI> or <HI>Confirmation;</HI> and the Circum∣stances of the most of us in this Country, are bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little better; for tho' we are favoured with some few <HI>Episcopal Ministers,</HI> yet they are generally such as were (according to this Gentleman's Way of
<PB N="55" REF="003651_0030_1002024756E0CFC0"/>Reasoning) baptized by <HI>Laicks,</HI> whose <HI>Baptism</HI> is therefore null, and they consequently, very unfit to administer the Ordinance to others, who are <HI>unbap∣tized</HI> themselves. Whether this be this Author's own Case, I cannot tell, he having concealed his Name: but every one knows, that it's the Case of the most of his Brethren in this Country, who have been <HI>bap∣tized</HI> zither in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>New England;</HI> And there∣fore, according to his declared Principles, are not in the Church themselves; and besure not capable to admit others into it by <HI>Baptism</HI> For to use his own Words, (p. 48.) <HI>can they baptize, who are not themselves Christians!</HI> They are not only out of the Way of Salvation themselves; but their miserable Hearers are like to perish with them, thro' the Nullity of their Administrations. How much does it therefore concern these Gentlemen, to seek <HI>episco∣pal Baptism,</HI> in order to their being Christians, be∣fore they boast of being the only Ministers in the Country; and before they cast so many famous <HI>Pro∣testant Churches</HI> out of the Fold of Christ; when they themselves are by these damning Principles, in the same unhappy State. Thus you see, Sir, what a fine Train of Consequences follow from the Gentleman's first Answer; and who must pass for <HI>Scurrilous</HI> now!</P>
<P>Let us next consider, whether he has any better Success, in answering the same Plea of the <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> <Q>The Argument of the <HI>Papists</HI> (he tells us) is this, You acknowledge a Possibility of Salvation in our Church, <HI>i. e.</HI> that invincible Ig∣norance joined with true Sincerity, may be an Apology for the Errors of many in it, which we do not acknowledge concerning yours. But pray who is so stupid as not to discover, that this is no Argument, why those who know the Errors and Superstitions of that Church, should go over to it?</Q>—By this Gentleman's Leave, I shall venture to retort the Answer. The Argument of the <HI>High Church</HI> Party, is this, You acknowledge
<PB N="56" REF="003651_0031_100202458E7844F8"/>our Ordination valid, <HI>i. e.</HI> that the invincible Mistakes, join'd with Sincerity, of those who submit to an uninstituted Hierarchy, may be an Apology for their Error in it, which we don't acknowledge concerning yours. But pray who is so stupid as not to discover, that this is no Argument, why those that know the Usurpations of <HI>Prelacy,</HI> their Inva∣sion of the Rights of <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and their unin∣stituted Original, should go over to them? I hope he won't be offended, with the Harshness of the Language, since it's borrowed from himself; and I think he'll be very much put to it, to make any Reply to this Reasoning, that mayn't with the same Justice, be urged in Favour of the <HI>popish</HI> Argument, which he undertakes to answer. He tells us indeed, that <Q>the Dissenters acknowledge <HI>episcopal Ordina∣tion</HI> lawful, and considered by itself safe and se∣cure, they ought therefore to submit to it; because a Deviation from it, cannot be acceptable to Al∣mighty God.</Q>— Which is so far from Truth, that we all believe, and have often enough proved, that the only <HI>Ordination,</HI> either instituted or ex∣emplified in the Scriptures, is by the Imposition of the Hands of a <HI>Presbytery;</HI> and that our Deviation from this, cannot be acceptable to Almighty God. We grant indeed, that their <HI>Ordinations</HI> are lawful, if he intends no more by their being <HI>lawful,</HI> than that they are <HI>not a Nullity;</HI> and that their Clergy are thereby authorized to administer sacred Ordi∣nances. But if he means by their being lawful, that their <HI>Episcopal Ordinations</HI> are such, as are according to the <HI>divine Pattern</HI> and <HI>Institution,</HI> we have ever denied it; and it is what they have never been able to prove. But were even that granted, that <HI>Episco∣pal Ordination</HI> is even in this latter sense lawful, how does that affect the Debate between us? Have we no other Objections against the <HI>Ordinations</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that are sufficient to deter us from going thither for Orders? Were there none
<PB N="57" REF="003651_0031_100202458E7844F8"/>such offered in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> that might have con∣vinced him, that we did not esteem these <HI>Ordina∣tions</HI> safe and secure for us?</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you see that we have no more Cause to be frighted with this Spectre than they have; whoever conjures it up.</P>
<P>I am now to shew you, that we have just Cause of the same Objections against their <HI>Episcopal Ordi∣nation,</HI> as were offered in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> notwithstand∣ing his pretended Answers to 'em. (p. 12-15.) I shall therefore, once more expostulate the matter with them; and consider his Replies, as I pass along.</P>
<P><HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> to acknowledge and submit to a <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> not warranted in the Word of God? To which he answers, No. Well then, he himself being Judge, it is not safest for us to seek Orders from their <HI>Bishops,</HI> till we are convinced of the divine Right of Prelacy. Let him therefore shew us, where this is to be found in the Word of God, and he will effectual∣ly silence our Objections.</P>
<P><HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> for me to solemnly declare at my Ordination, that I am moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon me the Office of a <HI>Deacon;</HI> when I have no Purpose to serve Tables, for which <HI>Deacons</HI> were instituted? To which he answers <Q>With Submissi∣on, we require better Authority than this Gentle∣man's Assertion, that <HI>Deacons</HI> were instituted bare∣ly to serve Tables.</Q> Well! he shall have better Authority, if that will satisfy him, from the very Words of the original Institution. Acts vi. 2, 3. <HI>Then the twelve called the Multitude of the Disciples unto them; and said, It is not Reason that we should leave the Word of God, and SERVE TABLES. Wherefore, Brethren, look ye out among you Seven Men of honest Report, whom we may appoint over THIS BUSINESS.</HI> It is possible, that any Thing can be
<PB N="58" REF="003651_0032_10023C43AF59B440"/>expressed in plainer Terms? Have <HI>Deacons</HI> any o∣ther business appointed them, than to <HI>serve Tables?</HI> Is nor serving of Tables put in direct Opposition to the Ministry of the Word?—But he tells us, that <HI>"Philip Deacon preached and baptized"</HI> Was <HI>Philip</HI> no more than a <HI>Deacon?</HI> Is he not expresly called an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> Acts xxi. 8? Nay, does nor our Au∣thor himself (in p. 28.) allow him to be an <HI>Evangelist</HI> at this very Time? And is it good Reasoning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat because <HI>Philip,</HI> who was once a <HI>Deacon,</HI> did when he became an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> preach and baptize, there∣fore all <HI>Deacons</HI> have Authority to preach and bap∣tize?— But <Q><HI>Ignatius</HI> (says the Gentleman) full as compleat a Judge as this Author, affirms in his E∣pistle to the <HI>Trallians,</HI> that <HI>Deacons</HI> are not Servants of Meats and Drinks <HI>only;</HI> but Ministers of the Church of God.</Q>—I shall not now spend Time to shew the undoubted Evidence, that these pretended Epistles of <HI>Ignatius</HI> are the spurious Offspting of some monkish Impostor: but shall only consider, whether there be any such Thing in his pretended Epistle to the <HI>Trallians,</HI> as that <HI>"Deacons are not Servants of Meats and Drinks</HI> ONLY." no, he plain∣ly says absolutely, they are not Servants of Meat and Drink; and why is ONLY added by our Author, but that if his spurious <HI>Ignatius</HI> had been admitted to speak <HI>his own</HI> Lauguage, he had in express Terms con∣tradicted the Scriptures, and thereby ruined his Credit with those that have a due value for that blessed Book?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some Copies indeed the <HI>negative</HI> Particle in <HI>Ignatius</HI> is left out; which make him <HI>affirm</HI> that Deacons are Ministers of Meats and Cups.

<P><HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> to take upon me the Order of <HI>Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od,</HI> an Order typical of our Lord Jesus Christ, ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in him, and abrogated by him?—Our Au∣thor says <Q>It is very safe to take upon me the Order of <HI>Priesthood,</HI> when duly called, and authoritatively
<PB N="59" REF="003651_0032_10023C43AF59B440"/>sent.</Q>—But it's pity, he did not better understand the Subject he was treating on, when he tells us, <Q>Had this Gentleman been so ingenuous, as to have distinguished, between the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of the <HI>Aaro∣nical</HI> Order, abrogated by our Saviour, and the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lchizedecan,</HI> restored in it's Room, there would be no Difficulty in the Thing.</Q>— That we may set this Matter in a true Light, it mayn't be amiss to con∣sider, what was the proper Work and Business of the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> wherein the Difference between the <HI>Priest∣hood</HI> of <HI>Aaron</HI> and of <HI>Melchizedec</HI> consisted; and in what Respect our Lord Jesus Christ is a <HI>Priest</HI> after the Or∣der of <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> and not after the Order of <HI>Aaron.</HI></P>
<P>We may first then consider, what was the proper Work and Business of the <HI>Priesthood.</HI> And this can't be better described, than in the Apostle's Language, Heb. v 1. <HI>For every high Priest taken from among Men, is ordained for Men, in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins.</HI> And Heb. viii. 3 <HI>For every high Priest is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices.</HI> Whence it's most certain, that every <HI>Priest,</HI> of whatever Order, is strictly and properly a <HI>Sacri∣ficer;</HI> that the very End and Design of the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> was to offer Gifts and Sacrifices; and that the Terms, <HI>Priest</HI> and <HI>Sacrificer,</HI> are synonymous and reciprocal. Whence, when all true Christians are allusively call∣ed <HI>an holy Priesthood,</HI> 'tis on Account of their <HI>offer∣ing spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 5.</P>
<P>And we may consider wherein the Difference be∣tween the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of <HI>Melchizedec</HI> and of <HI>Aaron</HI> con∣sisted. The Distinction between them was not with Relation to <HI>Sacrifices;</HI> the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of both was by these Oblations to lead the Minds, and direct the Faith and Hope of God's People, unto the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> by whom all the faithful of <HI>Adam's</HI> Progeny had their only Prospect of Reconciliation unto God. But it consisted in the special <HI>personal Qualifications,</HI> by which <HI>Melchizedec</HI> had the Preference of <HI>Aaron</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="003651_0033_10023C166634D688"/>He was immediately called to the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> without any external Rites of Consecration, such as were used at <HI>Aaron's</HI> Separation. He was a <HI>King,</HI> as well as <HI>Priest; Aaron</HI> had no regal Dignity. His <HI>Priesthood</HI> was perpetual, as he had not derived it from any other; and as he had no known Father or Mother, Beginning of Days, or End of Life. Whereas the <HI>Aaronical Priesthood</HI> was in a lineal Descent, and the <HI>Priests</HI> themselves were not suffered to continue by reason of Death▪ He was greater than <HI>Abraham:</HI> but the Aaronical Priests, as they were <HI>Abraham's</HI> Posterity, were his Inferiours. These were the special Differ∣ences, between the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of <HI>Melchizedec</HI> and of <HI>Aaron.</HI> And it was in these Respects, that the great <HI>high Priest of our Profession</HI> is said to be after the Order of <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> as may be particularly seen, in the viith Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> The <HI>Priesthood</HI> of <HI>Melchizedec</HI> and of <HI>Aaron</HI> was, in it self considered, in all Respects the same; in the same Manner referred to our Lord Jesus Christ, and terminated in him; though there were some peculiar <HI>personal</HI> Characters belonging to <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> more accommodated to the <HI>Priesthood of Christ,</HI> than were to be found in the Tribe of <HI>Levi:</HI> hence our Lord's <HI>Priesthood</HI> is said to be after his Order. From all which it necessarily fol∣lows, that unless this Gentleman will join with the <HI>Papists,</HI> in pleading for a proper propitiatory <HI>Sa∣crifice,</HI> he cannot with any colour of Reason pretend as he does, that <HI>their Ministry is properly Sacerdotal</HI></P>
<P>He indeed pretends to reason the Case, and says, <Q>Was Jesus Christ a proper <HI>Bishop</HI> over his Church, by Commission from his Father; and are the visible <HI>Bishops</HI> proper <HI>Bishops</HI> of it, by Mission and Com∣mission from him?</Q> then he challenges me to give any good Reason, if I can, <Q>Why by Mission and Commission from Christ, the <HI>high Priest of our Profession,</HI> they are not also proper <HI>Priests.</HI></Q> —To which I answer, one good Reason is, because all the Ministers of Christ have his Mission and Commission
<PB N="61" REF="003651_0033_10023C166634D688"/>to be <HI>Bishops,</HI> but none to be <HI>Priests.</HI> Let him, if he can, shew us any such Commission, and we will yield him the Cause. Another Reason is, because the A∣postle expresly tells us, <HI>Heb.</HI> vii. 24. that Christ has a <HI>Priesthood that cannot pass from one to another.</HI> For so the original Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies; and so it is rendred in the Margin of our <HI>Bibles.</HI> And if his <HI>Priesthood</HI> be of that Kind, that it cannot pass from him to any other, no Person can be a Sharer in it, nor a Successor to it. To which I add this further Reason for it, that tho' Christ hath use for <HI>Bishops</HI> in his Church, he has none for <HI>Priests;</HI> there being no pro∣per <HI>Sacrifices</HI> for such to offer, since he has offered up himself <HI>once for all.</HI>— Thus you see, what little Rea∣son we have, to leave our Scriptural <HI>Ordinations,</HI> to take upon us the Order of <HI>Priesthood</HI> among them. And so I go on to expostulate with him.</P>
<P><HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> to take upon me the solemn Charge of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> and to come under awful Vows to fulfil it; and yet depend upon the <HI>Bishop's Licence</HI> to preach? To which he answers, <Q>And pray where is the Inconsistency, of taking upon one the solemn Charge of the Ministry, and coming under Vows to fulfil it; and yet depending upon the Bishop's Li∣cence?</Q> Why! Is it no Inconsistency, to be under the most solemn and sacred Bonds to preach the Gospel, to be instant in Season and out of Season, and yet to be under contrary Bonds not to preach at all, but as the <HI>Bishop</HI> pleases? Is it no Inconsistency, to be au∣thorized by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by him com∣manded to the Exercise of the Ministry; and yet have no Authority to exercise it at all, till the <HI>Licence</HI> is sealed and paid for? In a Word, either <HI>Episcopal Or∣dination</HI> authorizes and obliges a Minister to preach, or it does not. If it does, <HI>wo to him if he preach not the Gospel,</HI> whether he has any <HI>Licence</HI> or no. If it does not, we have no great Reason to be fond of such <HI>Or∣dinations:</HI> where Authority is <HI>given</HI> with one hand, and in a sort <HI>taken away</HI> with the other.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="003651_0034_10023BDA959C49A0"/>
<HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> to acknowledge our <HI>Bishops</HI> en∣dued with the extraordinary Power of giving the Ho∣ly Ghost, by the Imposition of Hands? It's certain they seem to assume that Power, when they say, <HI>Re∣ceive the Holy-Ghost, for the Office and Work of a Priest in the Church of God now committed to thee, by the Imposition of our Hands.</HI> To which he answers. <Q>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apostles themselves were never endued with the Power of giving the Holy-Ghost.</Q>— And I grant that they were not endued with Power, authorita∣tively and efficiently to give the Holy-Ghost. But then he must grant, that the miraculous Gifts did ac∣company the Imposition of their Hands; and of their only, wherever they went. And the Question is Whethen these extraordinary Gifts do now accompa∣ny the Imposition of our <HI>Bishops</HI> Hands, in Ordinati∣on? For we don't see all our Episcopal Clergy en∣dued with them He answers to this, that <Q>he don't think it can be shewn in any one Instance from Scripture, that the Grace of the Spirit is ascribed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Man, as the Give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it; we therefore truth that God of his Goodness will still convey this Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thro' the Prayers, and by the Imposition of the A∣postles Successors Hands,</Q> to the End of the World. But he has here quite changed the Question, which was not about the <HI>Grace</HI> of the Spirit, but the mira∣culous <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Spirit; which were never receiv∣ed by the Imposition of any Hands, but the <HI>A∣postles</HI> only. And as for the sanctifying Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Spirit, Imposition of Hands was no institute▪ Means of obtaining it; nor do we read that it was ever once communicated by the Imposition of Hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> So that, take it in what sense he pleases, the Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is unwarrantable; and they have neither Precept Example, nor Promise, to found it upon.</P>
<P><HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> solemnly to promise at my Or∣dination, reverently to obey my <HI>Ordinary,</HI> that is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Bishop;</HI> and to swear canonical Obedience to the <HI>Bi∣shop,</HI> as you know has been commonly done? When
<PB N="63" REF="003651_0034_10023BDA959C49A0"/>I am taught to <HI>call no Man Master, but Christ,</HI> Mat. xxiii. 8, 10. To which it's answered, <Q>No Doubt on't, if you intend to perform your Promise; and that in Conformity to God's Command.</Q>—But he would have done well to have told us, what Com∣mand of God this would be a Conformity to. I have shewn him a Command of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>not to call any Man Master,</HI> to which he has made no Reply. And I shall only subjoin, that if not only promising, but <HI>swearing,</HI> not Scriptural, but <HI>canoni∣cal</HI> Obedience, he not to call a Man <HI>Master,</HI> in the sense forbidden in this Text, I know not what is. Truly, Sir, I desire to keep my Conscience free from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Shackles.</P>
<P><HI>Is it the safer Side,</HI> to be ordained to but a Part of the Ministerial Work; and to be deprived of the Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> which belong to a Gospel-Minister, as such, and which he must ac∣count for in the Day of Christ? He answers, <Q><HI>Yes,</HI> much the safest, because in acting otherwise, you act in direct Opposition to the Command of Christ, usurping Powers that in no measure belong to you.</Q> We must wait the Gentleman's Proof of this Asser∣tion. But I hope in the mean Time, that he and his Brethren won't pretend to be the <HI>only</HI> Ministers in the Country, when by his own Confession they have but a Part, and want (as he tells us p. 27) the much greater Part of the Ministry.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you have seen, that how much soever our Author may value himself upon his Performance, and flatter himself that he has convinced the can∣did Reader, that the Reasons in the <HI>Dialogue</HI> for preferring <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ordination, to Ordination by <HI>Bishops,</HI> appear <HI>ill-natured Suggestions</HI> (as he is pleased to express it) and not Substantial Reasons, they yet stand their Ground, against all his Exceptions.</P>
<P><HI>You have seen,</HI> how they of our Profession have from the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the Reformation gone thro' a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elancholy <HI>Series</HI> of Tribulation and <HI>Persecution,</HI> for

You have seen</HI> some of those multiplied Reasons we have, to complain of the Bishops <HI>imposing</HI> their Ceremonies upon us. <HI>You have seen,</HI> that their <HI>Episcopacy</HI> is an Assuming a <HI>Supremacy,</HI> absolutely for∣bidden by our Lord Jesus Christ, among the Ministen of the Gospel; and that it is a proper <HI>Lording it out God's Heritage.</HI> You <HI>have also seen,</HI> what little Rea∣son they have to triumph, upon the trifling Pretence, that <HI>theirs is the safer Side;</HI> unless it be safest to leave the Institutions of Christ, and submit to the Inventi∣ons of <HI>Men;</HI> to <HI>mock</HI> the blessed Spirit of God, in pretending to be <HI>moved by him,</HI> to take upon me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Office, that I never intend to exercise; to assume the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> which under the Gospel-Dispensation does incommunicably belong to the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> to take upon me the most solemn <HI>Vows,</HI> and depend upon another Man's <HI>Pleasure,</HI> whether I shall fulfil o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> violate them; to acknowledge, those extraordinary and miraculous <HI>Apostolical</HI> Qualifications reside in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> English <HI>Bishops,</HI> whereof they are not able to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the least Evidence; to <HI>swear</HI> Subjection to the Bi∣shops, according to the Injunctions of sundry seven uncharitable, and unscriptural Laws or Canons, where I am commanded to acknowledge no <HI>Master,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ, in matters of Conscience and Religion: and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be ordained to but a <HI>Part</HI> of the Ministerial Work, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I am called by God <HI>to the whole,</HI> and must account is the Day of Christ, for the exercise of the <HI>whole</HI> Ministrys Unless, I say, <HI>these Things</HI> make their Side the safest and unless it's the safest, because most <HI>uncharitable,</HI> we have no encouraging Motive to go over to the Church of <HI>England:</HI> who has made our Separation from help safe and just and necessary, by imposing unnecessary, unjust, and unsafe Terms of ministerial Conformity.
<PB N="65" REF="003651_0035_10023C0AA72E6D10"/>I Am at length come to the main Question, <HI>Whe∣ther the Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction be∣long to the</HI> Presbyters?</P>
<P>It seems the irresistible Evidence of this in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> has given such Conviction to our Author, as has forced him to quit the most of those strong Holds, which the Party have constantly endeavoured to defend; and has left him but one only Place of Retreat. <Q>I grant, (says he <HI>p.</HI> 16.) that the Names of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> are used so promiscuously in the New-Testament, as to leave no Distinction of Office. I grant that there are as many <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the first sense of the Word, as <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the most early Churches. I grant, that we can find in the New-Testament no <HI>Presbyter,</HI> who was not a <HI>Bishop,</HI> i. e. called by that Name. I grant, that the Duties and Qualifications of those called <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> in the New-Testament and of those called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are the same, because they are the Duties and Qualifications of the same Church-Officer, called by both these Names.</Q>—One would think, here are concessions enough, to put a perpetual End to this Controversy: and I might take the Advantage now to turn his own Argument, from the <HI>safer Side,</HI> a∣gainst him. — Surely he might with as much security to his Cause, have made <HI>one</HI> Concession more, and <HI>granted</HI> that <HI>all</HI> their Pretences to a <HI>Prelacy</HI> in the Church, and for the Superiority of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> to <HI>Pres∣bytery,</HI> are unscriptural and groundless. However, whether he will make this Concession, or no, we need not I think be in much Pain about the Issue of the Controversy, after he has granted, that the <HI>New Testament</HI> makes no Difference between <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters.</HI> However, he is resolved to hold fast the Conclusion, tho' he has given up the Premises.</P>
<P><Q>But tho' I have grante all this (says he) yet I hope may, and will maintain, that the Powers of those called <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New-Testament, were not the same, with the Powers of those who were
<PB N="66" REF="003651_0036_10023BEE7363F9B0"/>called so afterwards, in an eminent Sense: or in o∣ther Words, that those Church-Officers, who are stiled <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New-Testament, have never received nor exercised the Right of ordaining others; but that this Right was always in the Hands of Officers, superiour to them.</Q>—But how does all this appear? Can he give us any Evi∣dence of it? He tells us, <Q>It's evident from the Churches of <HI>Corinth, Ephosus, Philippi, Thessaloni∣ca, Crete</HI> &amp;c which had in them a Clergy, consist∣ing of several Ministers</Q> And then proceeds with the most scornful Air to inquire, "what Need there was for the <HI>Apostles</HI> to run the Hazard of long Journeys, and dangerous Voyages, for the performing <HI>Ordinations</HI> in these Churches, if the <HI>Elders</HI> already setled there, might have done it without them!—This, I confess, is a short and compendious Way of finishing a Dispute. At this Rate, no Adversary need ever want an Occa∣sion of Triumph. But I must tell this Gentleman, that here is too much in all Reason taken for granted, without any Proof.</P>
<P>He first takes for granted, that the Apostles found these Churches settled with <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Bishops,</HI> when they constituted a Gospel Ministry among them, which is so far from evident, that it is not so much as possible.—The only Account we have of the Apostles constituting <HI>Elders,</HI> in any of the Gertlle Churches, was at <HI>Lystra, Iconium, An∣tioch</HI> in <HI>Pisidia,</HI> and (it seems) <HI>Derbe.</HI> Acts xiv. 21, 23. And it is certain, at their first Visit to those Citles they had no Time to instruct and settle a Ministry a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng them; but were suddennly expelled out of their Coasts, by the Persecution raised against them, as appears from the twelfth and thirteenth Chapters of the Acts. There could therefore be no <HI>Chergy</HI> settled, when they ordained <HI>Elders</HI> there. This Gentleman should at least have given us a single <HI>Instance,</HI> of the <HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siles</HI> travelling to ordain <HI>Elders,</HI> where there was a <HI>Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> already settled, before he had entred
<PB N="67" REF="003651_0036_10023BEE7363F9B0"/>upon his Triumphs: but this, I dare say, is what can never be done. But what Need is there to dispute against such an <HI>inconsistent</HI> Supposal? Was there a <HI>Clergy</HI> consisting of several Ministers (as he asserts) <HI>settled</HI> in these Churches; and yet must the Apostles be supposed to run such Hazards, and endure such Fatigues, to ordain Ministers, where there were enough already ordained; and where they were not wanted?</P>
<P>He again takes it for granted, that the chief or only Errand of the <HI>Apostles</HI> to these Churches, was for <HI>or∣daining Ministers</HI> there.—But was there ever a more chimerical Supposal, when in all their Peregrinati∣ons, we find but one Account of their <HI>Ordaining El∣ders,</HI> in any particular Churches; and tho' it be there said, that they did this in every <HI>Church,</HI> yet it's plain, that it relates only to every Church <HI>there</HI> mentioned, viz <HI>Derbe, Lystra, Iconium</HI> and <HI>Antioch.</HI> As the Apostle tells us, 1 Cor. i 17 that <HI>Christ sent him not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel;</HI> so may it be likewise said, that Christ sent him not to ordain, but to preach the Gospel: that is, <HI>Preaching</HI> was his <HI>principal</HI> Work It appears to have been the usual custom of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> to tarry long enough in a particular Place, to convince them of the Truth of Christianity, and to initiate them in the Faith and Profession of the Gospel; and leave behind them, or send after them the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> to establish them in the Faith, to baptize the new Converts, and to settle the Ministry among them. For these Purposes was <HI>Titus</HI> left at <HI>Crete,</HI> (Titus i. 5.) and <HI>Timothy</HI> sent to most of the Churches where the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> had been, as appears by the several Epistles of that Apostle. To imagine therefore, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> visiting the Churches was peculiarly on the Account of <HI>Ordaining Elders,</HI> is such a groundless surmise as deserves no particular Animadversion.</P>
<P>He further takes for granted, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were properly <HI>Apostles;</HI> and such, had the
<PB N="68" REF="003651_0037_10023BE0DE023870"/>Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction committed to them. But does he bring one Word from <HI>Scripture</HI> to prove it? And may we not therefore (if I may borrow a Phrase from this Gentleman) place this to the Account of a strong <HI>Imagination.</HI></P>
<P>He tells us indeed (p. 18) <Q>that these were then commonly called <HI>Apostles,</HI> as <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Philippi</HI> is called by St.<HI>Paul</HI> himself, <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 25. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, your Apostle</Q> — But what is this to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> are they any where called <HI>Apostles?</HI> If not, how came they by their ordaining Power, which our Author makes peculiar to the <HI>Apostles?</HI></P>
<P>But was <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> really <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Philippi?</HI> How then came the Apostle to write an Epistle to the <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> of that Church by <HI>Epaphroditus?</HI> It's manifest if he was their <HI>Bishop,</HI> he had a Number of others, that were Partners with him, in the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Care of that Church, as appears, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> — Does St. <HI>Paul</HI> him self call him an <HI>Apostle?</HI> What is this but trifling with the Word <HI>Apostle,</HI> which in its natural and genuine Signification implies any <HI>Messenger</HI> whatso∣ever; and in this Sense was applied to <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> in the Text before us, who was the Philippians. <HI>Mes∣senger</HI> to carry their Bounty to the Apostle <HI>Paul.</HI> as appears <HI>Chap.</HI> iv. <HI>ver.</HI> 18. And as this Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a common and unappropriated Sense is used for <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sent,</HI> or a <HI>Messenger</HI> in general (particularly in <HI>John</HI> xiii. 16. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> viii. 23.) so it is remarkable that when it is appropriated to the superiour Officers in the Church, they are never called <HI>Apostles</HI> of any particular <HI>Churches;</HI> but <HI>Apostles of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. And it is necessary from the Nature of the Thing, that they should be so denominated: for they had their <HI>Mission</HI> from Christ, were sent by him; and were therefore HIS <HI>Apostles</HI> or <HI>Messengers;</HI> and not the <HI>Apostles</HI> or <HI>Messengers</HI> of the Churches, from whom they derived neither their Mission, nor Commission. They were Apostles <HI>unto</HI> the Churches; but not A∣postles
<PB N="69" REF="003651_0037_10023BE0DE023870"/><HI>of</HI> them. See 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix 2. To apply this to the Case of <HI>Epaphroditus.</HI> If he was the <HI>Philippians</HI> Apostle or Messenger, to the highest Office in the Christian Church, I enquire, By what Authority did they send him, to the Exercise of a sacred Character, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved only from Christ? But there's no Difficulty to understand, how he might be their <HI>Apostle</HI> or <HI>Mes∣senger,</HI> to carry Money to the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> and to minister to his Wants. Thus, Sir, you see the Fate of this Gentleman's chief Corner-Stone; he having no other Scripture-Foundation, to build his lofty Fabrick upon.</P>
<P>But if he can't engage the <HI>Scripture</HI> in his Service, he'll try what Assistance he can find from <HI>Antiquity.</HI> <Q>If we consult (say he) the ancient Records of the Church, we shall there find, that <HI>James Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem, Mark</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Timothy</HI> of <HI>Ephe∣sus, Titus</HI> of <HI>Crete,</HI> and <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> were all called <HI>Apostles.</HI></Q> But he has been so cautious as not to tell us, where these <HI>ancient Records</HI> are to be found: this were to submit the Case to Examination; and that would have spoiled all We are indeed informed, <Q><HI>Theodoret</HI> observes, that those which we call <HI>Bishops,</HI> the primitive Christians called <HI>Apostles.</HI></Q> But here also his former Cautiousness is retain'd; and we are not informed, where this is to be found in <HI>Theodoret</HI> But suppose these be <HI>Theodoret</HI>'s Words, what would he argue from them? I could also tell him, that his darling <HI>Ignatius</HI> observes, that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> are in the Place of the Council of the Apostles,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ep. to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> and exhorts, to be subject to the <HI>Pres∣byters,</HI> as to the <HI>Apostles</HI> of Jesus Christ our Hope,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ep. to the <HI>Trall.</HI></NOTE> and to reverence the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as the Sanhedrim of God, and College of the <HI>Apostles,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> and to follow the <HI>Presbytery</HI> as the <HI>Apostles</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ep. to the Smyrn.</NOTE> And <HI>Jerom</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">in Gal. i. 1, 19.</NOTE> observes, that all that had seen the Lord, and preached him af∣terwards,

<P>It is also evident, that the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Ordination</HI> did belong to those, who were called <HI>Presbyters, Bishops,</HI> or <HI>Overseers</HI> in the New Testament, from 1 Tim. 4 14. <HI>Neglect not the Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery.</HI> Is not this a plain and full Instance of <HI>Ordination</HI> by <HI>Presbyters?</HI> An Instance, that notwith∣standing all the evasive Arts of our Adversaries, to elude the Force of it, will yet be a continuing War∣rant for <HI>Presbyterian Ordination.</HI>— But our Author tells us (p. 21.) that <Q>it must be remembred, that the Gift that is here affirmed to be conferred on <HI>Timothy,</HI> by the <HI>Hands</HI> of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> in another Place is said to have been given him, by putting on of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Hands,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.6.</Q> This Objection was particularly answered in the <HI>Dialogue.</HI> It was there observed, that the Gift which <HI>Timothy</HI> received by the Imposition of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Hands, was the extraordinary Powers of the Holy Ghost, thus conferred upon the generality of Believers, in the Apostolick Times, by the laying on of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Hands.

<PB N="73" REF="003651_0039_10023BE6F6FA8620"/>it's plain, that this Text must refer to these Minis∣terial Duties pressed upon him; and must imply his Separation to those Duties, at his <HI>Ordination.</HI> But on the contrary, in 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. there are no such <HI>Duties</HI> treated on: but the very following Words to the Text, have a direct reference to these <HI>extraordinary Gifts</HI> of the Holy Ghost. <HI>For God hath no</HI> (ssays the Apostle) <HI>given us the Spirit of Fear; but of POWER, and of Love</HI> &amp;c. Whence it's manifest, that the Impo∣sition of Hands here spoken of, was for <HI>Timothy's</HI> re∣ceiving these <HI>Gifts</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> — Please to look into the <HI>Original</HI> Text, and perhaps you may be of opinion, that it very much favours my Interpreta∣tion. The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, you are sensible, properly signifies to <HI>put new Life into a Fire,</HI> or kindle it again. Now this metaphorical Expression can't, as I conceive, be so properly apply'd to the Gift of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> as to the Gift of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> The former is never (as I remember) compar'd to a <HI>Fire,</HI> but rather to a <HI>Treasure</HI> &amp;c But when Persons received the latter, they were said to be <HI>baptized with Fire,</HI> Matth. iii. 11. Act. ii. 3. So that we are yet left in the secure Pos∣session of the Text under Consideration.</P>
<P>It is further argued by this Author (p. 22) <Q>As the Word <HI>Presbyter</HI> is promiscuously applied to the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves, from hence it will follow, that by the laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Presbytery</HI> here mentioned, may very well be understood the laying on of the Hands of no other than the <HI>A∣postles.</HI></Q>—But how will this agree with the Argument we have been just considering?

Would it suit with St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Modesty and Humility, to arrogate to himself what other Apostles were equally concerned in?</HI> I hope he will give up one of these Arguments, unless he would establish his Cause by Contradictions. I'll
<PB N="74" REF="003651_0040_10023C06193D78B8"/>however suppose with this Gentleman, that the <HI>Pres∣bytery</HI> were all of them <HI>Apostles:</HI> he must nevertheless allow, that they acted in this Affair as a <HI>Presbytery;</HI> and how then will be justify their own Ordinations by a <HI>single Bishop?</HI> Is the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> a <HI>Pres∣bytery?</HI> Supposing him to have the full Power of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> can he find any Warrant from this Text o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any other, to ordain without such a Number of other <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Apostles,</HI> as will make a <HI>Presbytery?</HI> As for the <HI>Presbyters</HI> that lay on Hands with the <HI>Bishop</HI> they either have the Power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> or they have not. If they have, the Dispute is at an End. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not, How are Episcopal Ordinations performed by the Imposition of the Hands of a <HI>Presbytery?</HI> Let the World judge, who keep closest to this sacred Pattern; they whose Ordinations depend upon the Authority of one single Person, or we, who have always the Imposition of the Hands of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> in this so∣lemn Transaction.—Besides, if this <HI>Presbytery</HI> are al∣lowed to be <HI>Apostles,</HI> they acted in this Affair as <HI>Pres∣byters:</HI> and are therefore succeeded by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in the Power of <HI>Ordination.</HI> To say with this Gentle∣man, that <Q><HI>Presbyters</HI> no doubt they were, and perhaps superiour to <HI>Presbyters,</HI></Q> is but a mean begging the Question. His Business was to have proved, that it was not only possible, but certain, that they acted in this Affair in a Character superiour to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> if he would wrest this Text our of our Hands—What Reason can be possibly assigned, why they have here the Denomination of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> if they acted in a superiour Character? Was it on Purpose to lead us into a wrong Apprehension in this Matter? Would our Adversaries have failed of a Tri∣umph from this Text, if this Ordination had been said to be performed by the Imposition of the Hands of a Consistory of <HI>Bishops,</HI> or Officers superiour to <HI>Pres∣byters?</HI></P>
<P>I have already proved, that the Gift received by <HI>Timothy,</HI> by the Imposition of <HI>Paul's</HI> Hands, was not
<PB N="75" REF="003651_0040_10023C06193D78B8"/>his Ordination; and so there is no Room left for the trifling Criticism, we are entertain'd with, from the <HI>greek</HI> Prepositions <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And indeed there is nothing more certain, than that they are frequently in Scripture used promiscuously, and particularly in an Instance exactly parrallel to this before us, in <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 4, 12. where it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the 4th, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the 12th verse; and both intend the same Efficiency, or rather Instrumentality, in produc∣ing the Effect. See also <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 27. and many other Places.</P>
<P>But we are told (p. 23.) that <Q>supposing <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> peculiarly so called, were in this Company, (which doth not appear, nor will the primitive Fa∣thers at all allow) it will only follow from hence, that they may assist (with Officers superiour to themselves) at an <HI>Ordination:</HI> not that they may without such Officers manage this Affair</Q>—But by this Gentleman's Leave, there is more to be supposed, than that there were <HI>Presbyters</HI> in this Company; it is to be supposed, nay it is certain, even from the very Letter of the Text, that they were <HI>all Presbyters,</HI> and acted <HI>as such</HI> at this <HI>Ordination;</HI> and there is nothing but the meer strength of Imagination, to render the contrary Supposal in the least probable. And are we thus to give up plain Texts of Scripture, because Men will imagine that they may mean something else, though they themselves know not what? Is not this to render every Article of Our Religion precarious? However to gratify him, I'll suppose, that these <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> had the <HI>Apostle</HI> at their Head, in <HI>Timothy's</HI> Or∣dination. But that being granted, I yet demand, what Business had their Hands upon <HI>Timothy,</HI> in conferring an <HI>Order,</HI> that they had no Authority to communi∣cate, unless the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Ordination</HI> belongs to 'em? What can be more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, than to allow to <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> all the <HI>ordaining Act,</HI> and yet to deny them the <HI>ordaining Power?</HI> What is <HI>Ordination</HI> but a solemn Dedication or Separation of a suitable Person to God
<PB N="76" REF="003651_0041_10023BF0DEE45B10"/>for the Ministry, by Fasting and Prayer, with Impo∣sition of Hands? And did not the <HI>Presbyters</HI> do all this, in the Case before us? What could a <HI>Bi∣shop</HI> do more? Can he confer the Ministry by a meer Physical Contact?— It is allowed that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have Authority to do every <HI>Act,</HI> that belongs to <HI>Ordi∣nation;</HI> and yet the <HI>Bishop</HI> (it seems) must mono∣polize the <HI>Power</HI> of ordaining to himself. Can there be any Thing more inconsistent!</P>
<P>My Antagonist would fain find some <HI>other</HI> Business for the <HI>Presbyters</HI> Hands on the Head of the Candi∣date; and therefore tells us, <Q>Presbyters may lay on Hands, for the greater Solemnity of the Action, or to give their Consent or Approbation.</Q>—But have we any Scriptural Example of Imposition of Hands, for either of these Purposes? Would it ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Solemnity to the Action, for them to intrude into another Man's Province? Would not their saying <HI>Amen</HI> to the Ordination-Prayer, be sufficient to give their Consent or Approbation? In fine, I would observe, The Apostle evidently lays <HI>Stress</HI> on the Imposition of the Hands of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in <HI>Timothy's</HI> Ordination; he makes mention of it to him as a matter of Importance and eminent Weight. But what rational Account can be given of his placing such an Emphasis on the Imposition of <HI>their</HI> Hands, if their joyning in the Action was of so <HI>little Signifi∣cance,</HI> as is pretended by this Gentleman? I think I have here a fair Occasion, to borrow a Phrase from our Author: <HI>Who would be a Drudge to a Cause, that cannot be supported, without such pitiful shifts as these?</HI></P>
<P>ANother Evidence, that Ordination did belong to those called <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI> in Scripture, may be taken from <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1, 3. where we find <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> set apart to the Exercise of their Mi∣nistry among the Gentiles, only by the Imposition of
<PB N="77" REF="003651_0041_10023BF0DEE45B10"/>the Hands of a <HI>Presbytery.</HI>— That all the usual Acts and Rites of Ordination, as Fasting, Prayer, and Im∣position of Hands, were performed by these <HI>Presby∣ters;</HI> that this was done to separate <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barna∣bas,</HI> to the Work of their Ministry among the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> so much is plainly expressed in the Text. Now I must confess, I know not what <HI>Ordination</HI> is, if Se∣parating Men to the <HI>Exercise</HI> of the Ministry, by Fast∣ing and Prayer, with the laying on of Hands, be not a proper and formal <HI>Ordination.</HI> And that these Or∣dainers were <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and neither <HI>Apostles</HI> nor <HI>Di∣ocesan Bishops,</HI> is not only plain from the Text; but what our Adversaries themselves have acknow∣ledg'd; and my Antagonist evidently allows it.—What Reason then can be given, why this is not a standing Precedent, for <HI>Ordination</HI> by a <HI>Presby∣tery?</HI> — But our Author is loth to give up his Cause; and must therefore say something. <Q>I deny (says he <HI>p.</HI> 23.) that this was an <HI>Ordination</HI> at all; for if this were the <HI>Ordination</HI> of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> it will follow from hence, not only that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have a Right to or∣dain; but also that their Office extended to the or∣daining even <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves, and to give them the Authority which they had in the Church.</Q>—I deny his Consequence. For none pretend, that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were now authoriz'd to the <HI>Apostolate;</HI> they had their immediate &amp; extraordinary <HI>Call</HI> befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But being now, first to preach and settle the Gospel among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> they enter upon that special Exercise of their Ministry, at the ordinary Door of <HI>Ordination.</HI> Which supposal is so far from an Inconsistency, that it is not only exactly agreable to the sacred story in the Text before us; but is also to be esteemed a <HI>Decla∣ration of the Mind of God,</HI> as to the manner of Dedi∣cating Men to the Ministry, among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in all the succeeding Ages of the Church. And accord∣ingly Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> justly supposes, <HI>The Reason of this Ordination was, that the Lord hereby might set

<P>Our Author would fain evade the Force of this Text; and therefore frames several Imaginations to get clear of it. He imagines that this solemn Trans∣action was for the <HI>Benediction</HI> of these Apostles; and gives Instances of Imposition of Hands in <HI>Benedicti∣ons.</HI> (p. 24.)—But then,

</LIST></P>
<P>He goes on to argue, <Q>That this was not a proper <HI>Ordination,</HI> is manifest from hence; because this Rite of imposing Hands, whereby other Ministers were ordained, was never used in making <HI>Apostles.</HI> It was a distinguishing Part of their Character, that they were immediately called and ordained by Christ himself.</Q>—To which I answer, it is general∣ly acknowledg'd, that it was a distinguishing Part of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Character, to be immediately called by Christ himself, and that they could not be ordained to the <HI>Apostolate</HI> by the Imposition of Hands. But what a Pity it is, that this Gentleman could not have <HI>re∣member'd</HI> this? It would have saved him all the Trouble and Pains of his <HI>second Letter.</HI> For how then, I pray, can there be a <HI>Succession</HI> in the <HI>Apostolick Office?</HI> How come the <HI>Bishops</HI> to be <HI>Apostles,</HI> if it be <Q>a distinguishing Part of the Apostles Character,
<PB N="79" REF="003651_0042_10023BF2925154C0"/>to be called and ordained by Christ himself</Q>? Un∣less he can make it appear, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> have this <HI>immediate</HI> Call and Ordination. Thus his Argu∣ments have the ill Luck, to cut one another's Throats; which (to borrow another modest Phrase from this Gentleman) <HI>is no other than usually happens to the Abettors and Maintainers of bad and erroneous Causes.</HI></P>
<P>But let us see, how this Reasoning affects the pre∣sent Case. Allowing that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> could not be ordained to the <HI>Apostolick Office;</HI> allowing that they had an immediate Call to the <HI>Apostolate</HI> before: yet might not they have a <HI>peculiar Separation,</HI> to their Mission among the <HI>Gentiles?</HI> And was it not most agreable, that they should have a most open, and solemn, and known <HI>Dedication</HI> to that Business, a∣gainst which the <HI>Jewish Church</HI> had such strong and rooted Prejudices, as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> xi. 2. and xxi. 20, 25.?—It is observable, This Gentleman himself scruples not to talk of <Q><HI>Occasional Commissions</HI> to execute Apostolical Offices, confer'd on those that were Officers before, such as Prophets, Evangelists, &amp;c (p. 34)</Q> And now I know no Reason why I mayn't as well suppose a like fact, the <HI>occasional Separation</HI> even of those that were <HI>Officers before,</HI> such as <HI>Apostles,</HI> with relation to their new Labours in the <HI>Gentile</HI> World: and yet that occasional <HI>Separation</HI> such, with regard to the <HI>Manner</HI> of performing it, as affords a <HI>permanent Example</HI> to the Church.</P>
<P>The Gentleman has yet a further Answer to give: <Q>Suppose (says he, p 25.) that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were now ordained, what Advantage can the Dis∣senters reap thereby? This was done by an im∣mediate Command of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and conse∣quently can be no Precedent, for those that are not impowered by such a Commission.</Q> Was there not a full Answer given to this Objection in the Di∣alogue? And is it just now to propose it as a <HI>new</HI> Argument, without taking any No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice of the <HI>So∣lution</HI> there given to it? This indeed was his easiest
<PB N="80" REF="003651_0043_10023C26F2249BE0"/>and safest Method: but it won't recommend his In∣genuity, to any observing Person—I might justly here recommend him to the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> for an Answer, and make no other Reply: but that he mayn't com∣plain of Neglect, I add to what was there proposed. If it was from the immediate <HI>Command</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> then surely these <HI>Presbyters</HI> had a good <HI>Warrant</HI> for their Conduct; and the <HI>Precedent</HI> was well founded. Besides, it was necessary from the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Thing, that the <HI>first Examples</HI> of this Kind must be either by the immediate Direction of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> or else meer <HI>human</HI> Inventions. Let him, he can, give us an Account of any <HI>Ordinations</HI> perform∣ed in the <HI>Apostles</HI> Times, that were not directed by immediate Inspiration of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> So that, there be any Reasoning from the <HI>Account</HI> of these Things given us in the New Testament, we ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> justly conclude for <HI>Presbyterian Ordination,</HI> from the Case before us, as founded on Scripture-Institution.</P>
<P>ANother Evidence to prove, that <HI>Ordination</HI> was al∣lowed to and claimed by those called <HI>Presby∣ters</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New Testament, is this. They that have the <HI>principal</HI> and chief Parts of the sact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ministry committed to them, have also a Claim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>inferiour</HI> and subordinate Parts of that Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> And that <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Baptizing</HI> (which all allow to <HI>Presbyters</HI>) are the principal and chief Parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Ministry, appears from the <HI>Commission, Mat.</HI> xxviii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. where these are the only Ministerial Duties, ex∣presly committed even to the Apostles themselve.

Whence it's a necessa∣ry Consequence, that as they have the greater, they have also the less; as they have the principal and chief, they have also the subordinate Work of a Gospel Minister, committed to them. And why did he not see Cause to make some Reply to this Argument? Must we not look at his Silence as an implicit Acknowledgement, that he knew not what to say to it?—But if he can't an∣swer the Argument, he'll try if he can't raise some Objections, against what is proved by it. <Q>This ve∣ry Argument (says he) do the Papists use, to prove the sameness of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> as to Order; for as they say, the highest Act is to make the Bo∣dy and Blood of Christ present.</Q>—And what I pray follows from hence? If the Papists don't argue justly from their Idolatrous <HI>Mass,</HI> is there therefore no just arguing from this <HI>Scripture-Commission?</HI></P>
<P><Q>But pray (says the Gentleman, <HI>p.</HI> 28.) could not <HI>Philip</HI> the Evangelist <HI>baptize</HI> and <HI>preach,</HI> but could not confirm?</Q>—I would entreat him to tell us in the next what he means by <HI>Confirming:</HI> for I can find no more about it in the Scriptures, than about an <HI>apostolick Succession.</HI> I find indeed, in the eighth Chap∣ter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> that <HI>Philip</HI> did preach to the <HI>Sama∣ritans,</HI> and baptized many; but did not pretend to impose Hands upon any in order to their receiving the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost: this was a Power peculiar to the Apostles only; for which
<PB N="82" REF="003651_0044_10023BEA6B1CA6D0"/>Reason <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were sent down to them, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they might receive these extraordinary and miraculous Gifts; and accordingly we read, when the Apostles <HI>laid their Hands on them, they received the Holy Ghost.</HI> ver. 17. But what is this to episcopal <HI>Confirmation?</HI></P>
<P>He goes on <Q>The <HI>Presbyters</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> could feed the Flock, in doing of which no Doubt they <HI>preached</HI> and <HI>baptized:</HI> but it's plain they could not authorize another to do it. If they could, it's a∣mazing to find Persons of a superiour Character sent amongst them, to manage that Affair.</Q> The Gentleman was doubtless very much pleased with this Argument, that it's so often repeated: but was ever any Thing more chimerical? Who were the Persons sent among them, to manage that Affair? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there the least Foundation for these Suppositions, in the Scriptures?—I am ready to suppose, by what I find him saying elsewhere, that he intends by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that <HI>Timothy</HI> was the Person of a superiour Character sent to ordain <HI>Elders</HI> at <HI>Ephesus.</HI>—But this is only founded upon his own Imagination. For the Scrip∣tures are wholly silent about <HI>Timothy's apostoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Character, as well as about his being ever concern∣ed, in ordaining <HI>Elders</HI> at <HI>Ephesus.</HI> So that he might well enough have spared his toothless Satyr, upon this Occasion.—Thus after all he has said, or can say, it yet appears, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are in the Possession of the principal Parts of the Gospel-Mini∣stry. They are authorized by the <HI>Commission,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only to <HI>Baptize,</HI> but to <HI>preach</HI> the Gospel; which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> esteemed the chief and principal Work, that he was sent upon. 1 Cor. i. 17.</P>
<P>It was also made evident, that <HI>Preaching and Baptizing</HI> are the greater Parts of a Minister's Work and that <HI>Ruling</HI> and <HI>Ordaining</HI> must therefore belong to them, who are authorized to the Exercise of these, from 1 Tim. v. 17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour; especially those that labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> From whence it
<PB N="83" REF="003651_0044_10023BEA6B1CA6D0"/>was argued: If they that labour in the Word and Doctrine are especially worthy of double Honour, more than they that rule well, then labouring in Word and Doctrine is a Work superiour to Ruling, and the principal Part of the Ministry. To which he answers <Q>The very Elders who ruled the Church; and over and above that Service, labour'd in preaching the Word, are the Persons counted wor∣thy of double Honour. Here is no Preference given to <HI>Preaching</HI> above <HI>Ruling:</HI> but <HI>Rulers</HI> are commended, for executing the other Parts of the Ministry.</Q>—What! were these <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Preach∣ers</HI> the same sort of Officers? Are the <HI>Rulers only commended, for executing the other Parts of their Mi∣nistry?</HI> Then the Apostle recommended such to double Honour, who were under the general Obli∣gation to preach instantly, in Season and out of Sea∣son; and yet did not labour in Word and Doctrine. And is this credible, that the Apostle should esteem lazy slothful Ministers, worthy of double Honour, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed of any Honour at all? However all must grant, that such Ministers as both <HI>rule well,</HI> and are constant Preachers, are worthy of more Honour, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir non-preaching <HI>Bishops.</HI> And so I think we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose as little in Point of Honour, as we have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Argument, by this Comment upon the Text.</P>
<P>I shall have further Occasion to consider, who were the proper <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in their ordinary Capacity; and to make it evident against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll this Gentleman's Exceptions, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave all the ordinary Powers of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot want Authority for <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdic∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion.</HI> It is therefore needless, to take Notice of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e here says upon that Subject.</P>

THere was this further Argument used in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> to prove, that the Powers both of <HI>Or∣dination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> were inherent in, and claimed by those called <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New-Testament: They that have the <HI>Keys</HI> of the Kingdom of Heaven committed to 'em, have the Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction.</HI> This Pro∣position is self-evident, for all allow that <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> are Exercises of the Power of the <HI>Keys.</HI> And that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have the <HI>Keys</HI> of the Kingdom of Heaven committed to 'em, is what our Adversaries themselves do also in Effect allow All grant them the <HI>Key</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and who the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can deny them the <HI>Key</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> since Christ gave all the <HI>Keys</HI> together, Matt. xvi. 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and John xx. 23.

He gives no single <HI>Key</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Person; but <HI>Keys,</HI> and whatever these <HI>Key</HI> serve for. Now <HI>what Christ has joined together, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may not put asunder.</HI> But our Author found this Ar∣gument too hard for him; and therefore prudently passed it over in Silence. And so we are left in the full and peaceable Possession of the <HI>Keys</HI> both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Discipline;</HI> and how then can b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disown our Authority for <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> I appeal to the World, whether his Silence at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Place is not a fair giving up the Cause. For wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did he pass over this Argument, if he did not find it unanswerable?

<P>IT was further urged in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who are in <HI>Orders</HI> themselves, have according t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the apostolical Constitution, Authority to confer <HI>Or∣ders</HI> upon others; and consequently, <HI>Presbytery</HI> have Power to ordain others to the same Ministry which they themselves have received.

Whence it was enquired, If <HI>Timothy</HI> had Authority to <HI>commit the same Things which he had received, to other faithful Men,</HI> why han't all others in the Ministry, the same Authority? He answers (p. 29) <Q>Because it is not inconsistent with the Nature of the pastoral Office, or to the Gospel, to communicate the intire Power to some Officers; and some Branches of it only to others.</Q> This we have his bare Word for; and it is proved as far as the Word of a Gentleman will go in this Case. But I must needs say, that rational Scripture-Evidence of this would go further with me, than many such Assertions, how positive soever. I find nothing in the Scripture, for thus crumbling the Work of the Ministry into Parts; but on the con∣trary, we are <HI>all</HI> required to <HI>take Heed to our Ministry, and fulfil it.</HI> But he tells us, <Q>We know well that one <HI>Deacon</HI> cannot ordain another, consistent with the Dissenters own Scheme.</Q> —But are <HI>Deacons</HI> themselves in <HI>sacred Orders,</HI> in the Sense now debat∣ed, according to <HI>our own</HI> Scheme? What then is this to the Purpose? Yet I can't help adding, That if <HI>Deacons</HI> may by virtue of their Office <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>baptize,</HI> and make their <HI>Pulpit Prayers</HI> too (ac∣cording to the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Practice) I know of no Im∣propriety there wou'd be in asserting their Right also to <HI>ordain:</HI> because he that may do the greater, may certainly do the lesser, — as before. And truly to be free, I should look upon Ordination performed by a Church of England <HI>Deacon,</HI> to have <HI>Validity,</HI> as tru∣ly as Ordination by a <HI>Prelate.</HI> But now according to <HI>our</HI> Scheme, the <HI>Deacons</HI> have no Authority by vir∣tue of their Office to <HI>preach</HI> or <HI>baptize,</HI> or preside and lead in the <HI>publick Worship.</HI> It wou'd be absurd therefore to suppose a Power in <HI>them,</HI> of giving Or∣der, when the performing publick <HI>Prayers,</HI> and ad∣ministring solemn <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>Charges</HI> in the Name of Christ, belong to the Work of Ordination. Whereas there's nothing in the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Thing, that ne∣cessarily
<PB N="86" REF="003651_0046_10023BF669AFE3E8"/>precludes <HI>Presbyters</HI> from the Right of Or∣daining; who are by their Office authoriz'd to perform the several Actions that belong to Ordinati∣on. This, I doubt not, wou'd appear very plain to our Opponents, if they cou'd but once disingage themselves from their singular Fancy about an <HI>autho∣ritative external Commission</HI> or Delegation of Power, and consider <HI>Ordination</HI> in the Light we do, as a <HI>ministerial declarative</HI> and <HI>dedicating</HI> Act. They wou'd then see there is some Weight in Bp. <HI>Usher's</HI> Maxim, <HI>Ordinis est ordinare.</HI>—In Reply to what I had further argued, our Author subjoins, <Q>Al∣tho' <HI>Bishops</HI> do consecrate <HI>Arch-Bishops,</HI> it will not follow that <HI>Presbyters</HI> should ordain <HI>Presby∣ters;</HI> and the Reason is plain, because <HI>Presbyters</HI> are not at all impowered, in the New Testament, to perform this Work.</Q>—But he should have remembred, that this is the very Case in Question; and therefore was it self to be proved, and not brought as an Argument. He, and I, have both appealed to the World, as to the Truth of this Assertion. The World is now to judge, whether it is not fully made appear from the New Testament, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are impowered to perform this Work. And I also appeal to the World, whether this ben't a good Evidence of <HI>Presbyters</HI> Authority to or∣dain, that they <HI>have all the Powers</HI> committed to them in the New Testament, that belong to any ordinary Ministers of the Gospel; as I have already proved, and hope to make further Evident, not∣withstanding all he can say to the contrary.—He con∣cludes this Head with saying, <Q>Neither do we allow of Inferiors consecrating Superiors, as this Writer wou'd disinginuosly insinuate: For all Bishops have originally equal Power; tho' a primacy of Order is granted to some by general Consent <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Upon which I must be free to say, <HI>This Gentle∣man</HI> certainly acts the disingenuous part, rather than I: For he <HI>denies,</HI> that in the Church of Eng∣land
<PB N="87" REF="003651_0046_10023BF669AFE3E8"/><HI>Inferiours</HI> consecrate <HI>Superiours,</HI> and yet at the same time in Effect <HI>acknowledges</HI> it, by confess∣ing that <HI>Bishops</HI> do consecrate <HI>Arch-Bishops,</HI> and that Arch-Bishops have a <HI>primacy of Order;</HI> which I think sufficiently speaks them <HI>Superiours.</HI>—I said nothing about Imparity of <HI>Power:</HI> and yet, I believe our Author wou'd find it difficult to persuade the World, that <HI>Arch-Bishops</HI> in <HI>England</HI> have not a <HI>Primacy</HI> of Power, as well as Order; Else why are the Bishops oblig'd to take an Oath of <HI>Canonical O∣bedience</HI> to them?—But still it wou'd not hurt my Argument, if I shou'd allow him his Episcopal Parity. For if <HI>Bishops</HI> may ordain their <HI>Equals,</HI> there's the same Reason to allow <HI>Presbyters</HI> to do the like. Bishop <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> tells us <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 306.</NOTE>, <Q><HI>Tertullian</HI> makes the Government of the Church to lie in a <HI>Con∣sessus Ordinis,</HI> which (says he) I know not other∣wise to render, than by a <HI>Bench of Presbyters;</HI> because <HI>only they</HI> were said <HI>in ordinem cooptari,</HI> who were made <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and <HI>not those</HI> who were promoted to a <HI>higher Degree</HI> in the Church. By the way (he adds) we may observe the Original of the name of <HI>Holy-Orders</HI> in the Church; not as the Papists, and others following them, as tho' it noted any thing <HI>inherent</HI> by way of (I know not what) <HI>Character</HI> in the Person; but because the Persons ordained were thereby admitted <HI>in Or∣dinem,</HI> among the number of Church-Officers. So there was <HI>Ordo Senatorum, Ordo Sacerdotum</HI> &amp;c. among the Romans.—From hence the use of the Word came into the Church; and thence Ordina∣tion, <HI>ex vi Vocis,</HI> imports no more than a solemn Admission into this Order of Presbyters—And the Collation of Orders (says he <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 273.</NOTE>) doth come from the power of Order, and not meerly from the power of Jurisdiction.— <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 276.</NOTE> Those that are for Ordinations only by a <HI>superior</HI> Order in the Church, <HI>acknow∣ledging</HI>

And truly <HI>so great stranger</HI> was this Doctrine even there from the time of the Reformation for many Years that the King's <HI>'Professor</HI> at <HI>Oxford</HI> branded <HI>Lard</HI> with publick Infamy for asserting the <HI>Divine</HI> Right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Episcopacy.</HI>—By the way then we may learn what Opinion the <HI>Reformers</HI> would have had of many in our Times, who boast themselves <HI>true Sons</HI> of the Church of England, and yet are Zealots for an <HI>is famous unchurching</HI> Principle.</P>
<P>I come now to our Author.</P>
<P>HE would in the next Place (p. 30.) insinuate, that <Q>all the Churches of the <HI>Ausburg</HI> Con∣fession, those of <HI>Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Hun∣gary, Transylvania</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI></Q> are all under <HI>Episcopal</HI> Government. But were this Representa∣tion as just as it is unjust, what would it be to his Purpose? Is there any one of these Churches, that derive the <HI>Succession</HI> of their Ministry, from <HI>episcopal Ordination?</HI> Was not the <HI>Reformation</HI> carried on by <HI>Presbyters</HI> amongst them all? And even in tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Countries where they now have <HI>nominal</HI> Bishops were not their <HI>first</HI> Bishops after the Reformation ordained by <HI>Presbyters?</HI> Did not <HI>Bugenhagius</HI> a <HI>Pres∣byter</HI> ordain the first seven Superintendents, or <HI>Bi∣shops:</HI> in <HI>Denmark?</HI> And the like may be said of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who therefore by our Author's Plan are in
<PB N="89" REF="003651_0047_10023BDE93C975D0"/>no better Case, than if they had no <HI>Bishops</HI> at all. But the worst on't is, that this Gentleman's Story is false in Fact. Hear Bishop <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> upon the Matter. <Q>In <HI>Sweeden</HI> (says he) there is one <HI>Arch-Bi∣shop</HI> and seven <HI>Bishops;</HI> and so in <HI>Denmark,</HI> though not with so great Authority. In <HI>Holstein, Pomeren, Mecklenburgh, Brunswick, Lunenburgh, Bremen, Oldenburgh, East Friezland, Hessen, Saxony,</HI> and the upper Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Protestant Imperi∣al Cities, Church-Government is in the Hands of <HI>Superintendants.</HI> In the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> they had <HI>In∣spectores</HI> and <HI>Praepositi,</HI> over which was the eccle∣siastical Consistory — And so they have their <HI>Praepo∣siti</HI> in <HI>Wetteraw, Hessen,</HI> and <HI>Anhalt.</HI> In <HI>Transyl∣vania, Polonia, &amp; Bohemia,</HI> they have their <HI>Seniores,</HI> enjoying the same power with ancient Bishops</Q> [who, according to this learned Writer, were but <HI>prudential</HI> Officers, having only for more convenient <HI>Order</HI> a Presidency over the ecclesiastical Senate, or Presbytery in their respective Churches.] <Q>All these (he assures us) acknowledge no such Thing, as the <HI>Divine</HI> Right of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> but stiffly maintain <HI>Jerome's</HI> Opinion, of the primitive <HI>Equa∣lity</HI> of Gospel-Ministers.</Q> Thus he. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Iren.</HI> p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> [By the way I shou'd be glad our Author wou'd inquire and inform me whether these Superintendents or Bishops in the foreign Churches at this Day have a Metropo∣litan or <HI>Episcopal Consecration.</HI>] And does not my Antagonist know, that besides the Church of <HI>North Britain,</HI> there are a very considerable Number of our Profession in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and together with these, the <HI>Belgick</HI> Churches, the remains of the reformed <HI>French</HI> Churches, the Churches of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> which have no <HI>Bishops,</HI> neither Name nor Thing.

The positive Laws of God are all Sacrosanct, especially those he hath ordain'd for Government; and he will in no wise excuse the wilful Neglect of them; but every such Transgression against the Polity of the Christian Theocracy, let the Number of the Offenders be never so great, shall receive a just Recompence of Reward.</Q> Thus you see, how he charitably Damns all the foreign <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> by the Lump, and consigns them over to eternal Ruin.—To what amazing Lengths will High-Church Biggotry carry Men!

<P>I Have hitherto been considering the Gentleman's Answers to our Arguments, for the divine Right of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination:</HI> we are now to see, what Evidence he can bring for <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy;</HI> and it might reasonably have been expected, he should have a very strong Foundation to build his Super∣structure upon, since no less than the very Being of the Church and our Eternal Safety do (according to him) absolutely depend upon it. But when I read this Letter, I am surprized to find, that he does not so much as pretend to found his Cause upon Scripture-Evidence; nor offer at any one Argument, that <HI>Prelacy</HI> was established in the Church by <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles.</HI> His whole Business is, to answer such Objections, as he is pleased to throw in his own Way, while he professedly <HI>omits particularly An∣swering the Dialogue,</HI> for these Reasons: <Q>First, be∣cause Part of it has been already considered; se∣condly, because (he tells us) I have placed my Antagonist's Argument in so indifferrent a Light, that he thinks himself not at all obliged, to regard my stating the Questions in Dispute.</Q> p. 31. —This is a Method truly artful enough, to amuse his Reader; and I think safe enough for us, let him im∣pute his Neglect of the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> to what Cause he pleases.</P>
<P>The Method be proposes to gain his Point by, is to prove four <HI>Propositions;</HI> the Performance of which is next under Consideration.</P>
<P>His first <HI>Proposition</HI> is <Q>That the Apostles had properly <HI>Successors,</HI> in the <HI>Essentials</HI> of the <HI>aposto∣lick Office.</HI></Q> (<HI>p.</HI> 32.) Well! suppose this were granted to him, what Consequence would he draw from it? The Question would still recur, who are these <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles?</HI> Were they <HI>Pres∣byters,</HI> or <HI>Diocesan Bishops?</HI>—I shall here take Op∣portunity, to discharge my Debt to this Author; and
<PB N="92" REF="003651_0049_10023BFF75F7A0C8"/>to shew him, that notwithstanding his frivolous Ob∣jections in his first Letter, the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their ordi∣nary Capacity were but <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and consequent∣ly this <HI>Succession</HI> (if it be allowed him) is a <HI>Succession</HI> of <HI>Presbyters.</HI> They are <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and not <HI>Dioces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Bishops,</HI> that are still vested with the <HI>apostolick</HI> Character.

If by their im∣mediate Call they were endued with some extraor∣dinary Powers; yet in their ordinary Capacity, they are never represented otherwise in the New-Testa∣ment, than as <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And let this Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n frame what Imaginations he pleases, about this Matters the <HI>Scripture-Account</HI> of it is most to be depende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon. He tells us indeed (p. 19) that <Q>it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not appear, that they are no other than <HI>Presbyters</HI> — For tho' a superiour <HI>Order</HI> does frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> presuppose and include all it's relative in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <HI>Orders;</HI> yet in no Case does the contrary Obtain being unnatural, and so irrational.</Q>— But it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> appear, that they were <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and let him, he can, make it appear, that they were (in the ordinary Capacity) any <HI>more</HI> than so. To suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it <HI>possible,</HI> that they might be more than so, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arguing; but begging the Question. By the far Way of reasoning, I can prove them to be every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Pope.</HI> It is but supposing our Author arguing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Succession</HI> in the <HI>Papacy,</HI> and the Conclusion wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as naturally follow.

For does a <HI>Doctor</HI> write himself <HI>Batchellor,</HI> a Serjeant at Law write himself <HI>Barrister,</HI> or a <HI>Duke</HI> style himself <HI>Marquess,</HI> as the <HI>Apostles</HI> write themselves <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the quoted Texts? In a Word, the supposal of a <HI>Succession</HI> in the <HI>Apostolick Office</HI> won't serve his Turn, inasmuch as <HI>Presbyters</HI> have the only just Claim to a <HI>Succession</HI> from the <HI>Apostles.</HI> And if the <HI>Apostles</HI> had properly <HI>Successors,</HI> in the <HI>Essentials</HI> of the <HI>A∣postolick Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> (as he says they had) they were no other than <HI>Presbyters.</HI> He can find no Mention of any others to succed them, in all the New Testa∣ment.</P>
<P>But it's Time to consider, whether there be any Truth in this <HI>Proposition,</HI> upon which his whole Cause depends. How does it appear, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> had properly <HI>Successors</HI> in the <HI>Essentials</HI> of the <HI>Apostolick Office?</HI> Why, our Author asserts it, nay he has pro∣mised to prove it; and is not that sufficient? At present, he has Leisure for no more, than to answer some Objections against it: and we must have Pa∣tience to wait for the Proof of it, till some better Opportunity.</P>
<P>He tells us, <Q>All my Adversary's Arguments will be fully considered, if I can give a clear and satisfactory Answer to this Question. Whether the extraordinary Priviledge of working <HI>Miracles,</HI> and being <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> which the Apostles were blessed with, were <HI>Essential</HI> to the <HI>Apostolick Office?</HI> I deny they were; and my Adversary affirms the contrary.</Q> But by his Leave, I must tell him, that my Arguments are not all answered, till he has replied to what was urged in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> from the <HI>unlimited</HI> Commission of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="94" REF="003651_0050_10023BFB1FC7DD40"/><HI>Apostles;</HI> and reconciled that small inconsistency, of their <HI>Bishops</HI> having an <HI>universal Charge</HI> (as the <HI>A∣postles</HI> had) and yet being <HI>fixed</HI> Pastors of a <HI>particu∣lar Diocess.</HI> For this was one Argument, particular∣ly insisted upon, in the <HI>Dialogue.</HI> But since he is (as he tells us) for reducing the Debate, into as short a Compass as possible; and is pleased to neglect what he is not willing to answer; let us see how he performs what he has undertaken.</P>
<P>He first attempts to help out his Cause by explain∣ing the <HI>Question;</HI> and tells us (p. 33.) <Q>In order to give a clear Answer to this <HI>Question,</HI> I will suppose, that by <HI>Essential,</HI> this Gentleman understands something that was <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apostolick Office;</HI> and what distinguishes it from all others</Q>— But I must tell him, he has quite <HI>Mistaken</HI> my Meaning; and given a very <HI>wrong</HI> Explication of the Word <HI>Essential.</HI> It is <HI>Essential</HI> to a <HI>Brute,</HI> to have a sen∣sitive Soul; but then it is not <HI>peculiar</HI> to a Brute, nor what distinguishes it from all others: For I think this Gentleman has one too. It is <HI>Essential</HI> to a <HI>Man,</HI> to be a reasonable Creature; but not <HI>peculiar</HI> to him: there are other rational Beings in the Creati∣on. It is <HI>Essential</HI> to a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britian,</HI> that he be a Protestant; but not <HI>peculiar</HI> to him. I am willing to believe my Antagonist to be one too. And a hundred like Instances, might be given him.—But what I intend, by these Things being <HI>Essential</HI> to the <HI>Apostolick Office,</HI> is, that they are so <HI>necessary,</HI> that none could be <HI>Apostles</HI> without them; not that they were all of them <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> The Apostles were indeed blessed with some miraculous Gifts, which were <HI>peculiar</HI> to them; such as the Holy Ghost's being given by the Imposition of their Hands, which was not only necessary to every <HI>Apostle,</HI> upon which Account the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> calls these Gifts thus communicated, <HI>the Signs of an Apostle,</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 12. but they were also such Powers, as none but they were ever endued with. The like
<PB N="95" REF="003651_0050_10023BFB1FC7DD40"/>may be said of the <HI>Apostles</HI> being <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection of Christ.</HI> For tho' many others as well as they, were capable of witnessing to this Fact, yet they were not peculiarly commissioned, and sent a∣bout the World to be <HI>Evidences</HI> of it: and therefore are not (I think) in the New Testament denominated WITNESSES of the <HI>Resurrection</HI> in such a pecu∣liar Manner as the <HI>Apostles</HI> are. But it can't be said of all the extraordinary Qualifications, that were <HI>Essential</HI> to the <HI>Apostleship,</HI> that they were thus <HI>pe∣culiar</HI> to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> It was <HI>Essential,</HI> for Instance, to the very Being of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> that he had a certain Knowledge of that great Fact, upon which Christi∣anity so much depends; that Christ risen was <HI>what</HI> he <HI>had heard, what he had seen with his Eyes, what he had looked upon; and his Hands had handled,</HI> 1 John i. 8. Wherefore it was a necessary Qualifica∣tion, when an <HI>Apostle</HI> was chosen in the Place of <HI>Judas,</HI> that he should be one, <HI>that had companied with the eleven Apostles, all the Time that the Lord Jesus went in and out amongst them, beginning from the Baptism of John, to the same Day, that he was taken up from them, in order to his being a Witness with them of his Resurrection.</HI> Acts. i. 21, 22. And in like manner, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is caught up to the third Heavens, that he might by a sight of Christ be furnished for a <HI>Witness</HI> of his <HI>Resurrection,</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 2. compared with <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 17. and <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 17, 18. But then there were <HI>five hundred</HI> besides these, that had seen Christ after his Resurrection. 1 Cor. xv. 6. So also it was Essential to an <HI>Apostle,</HI> that he should have the <HI>miraculous Gifts</HI> of the Holy Ghost, to <HI>confirm</HI> his Testimony of the <HI>Resurrection of Christ,</HI> to Jews and Infidels, who would not receive this for Truth, upon Men's bare Word, without this Seal of Heaven to confirm it; as is largely proved in the <HI>Dialogue:</HI> and yet it is manifest, that the most, if not all the Christians, wherever the Apostles went, had these
<PB N="96" REF="003651_0051_10023C526C9C41F0"/>miraculous Gifts, as well as they, tho' not in so great a Degree.</P>
<P>It is fully sufficient to my Purpose, that these Qua∣lifications were <HI>Essentially</HI> necessary to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> whether they were <HI>peculiar</HI> to them or not. It is enough, that they could not be <HI>Apostles</HI> without them. Let us but see their <HI>Bishops</HI> endued with these Qua∣lifications, and thus furnished to be sent about the World, to be <HI>Witnesses</HI> of <HI>Christ's Resurrection,</HI> and I will allow them to be properly <HI>Successors</HI> in the <HI>Apostolick Office.</HI> But in the mean Time, in vain does this Author plead, that it's evident, <Q>that these extraordinary Gifts we are speaking of, were so far from being <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> that many Men were endued with them, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad no share at all in the Ministry.</Q> In vain does he urge, that <Q>if the <HI>Essentials</HI> of the <HI>Apostolick Office</HI> consisted in their being <HI>Witnesses</HI> of <HI>Christ's Resurrection,</HI> and the extraordinary Assistances of the Holy Ghost, then the <HI>Seventy Disciples,</HI> who had the extraordinary Assistances of the Holy Ghost and were <HI>Witnesses</HI> of <HI>Christ's Resurrection,</HI> were Apostles; and the five hundred Brethren, by whom he was seen at one Time, were <HI>Apostles.</HI></Q> For who ever pretended, that these Things were <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> or that they were <HI>the Essentials</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Apostolick Office? It suffices that they were <HI>Essential</HI> to the <HI>Apostleship,</HI> which is a quite different Thing. That was what I undertook to prove, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I think have made abundantly evident, in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> to which I refer you for Satisfaction. But what has my Antagonist advanced against this? Has he said one Word to prove, that any can be <HI>Apostles</HI> without this? No! that was to attempt an Impossiblity. Thus has he stumbled at the Thre∣shold. Thus has he left the Arguments as he found them, untouch't by any Thing he has said. And thus also would I leave his first <HI>Proposition,</HI> were it not for one or two Things that occur under it, that may
<PB N="97" REF="003651_0051_10023C526C9C41F0"/>possibly be thought worthy of Notice. Particularly</P>
<P>He quotes <HI>Matth.</HI> xxviii. 20. to prove, that the <HI>Apostolick Office</HI> was to continue for ever in the Church.—But does that Text say any Thing about the <HI>Apostolick Office?</HI> That the <HI>Apostles</HI> were, in their <HI>Successors,</HI> to continue to the End of the World, is indeed manifest from that Text. But then the Question is, <HI>how</HI> are they succeeded? In their <HI>ex∣traordinary,</HI> or in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity? If the former, let their imaginary <HI>Successors</HI> shew us those extraordinary Qualifications, that were Essentially necessary to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and we will acknowledge their <HI>Apostolick</HI> Character. If the latter, I have al∣ready proved, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are their proper <HI>Suc∣cessors;</HI> and he has not shewn us, nor can be shew us, that any but <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are by divine Appointment to succeed them, in either Capacity.</P>
<P>Another Thing that I could not lightly pass over, is his evading my Answer to the Arguments, brought from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii 28. and <HI>Eph</HI> iv. 11. <Q>This Gentle∣man (says he) would fain know, how it appears, that <HI>Apostles</HI> are permanently set in the Church, and to continue till Christ comes: when <HI>Prophets, Evangelists, Miracles, Gifts of Healing,</HI> and <HI>Di∣versity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongues,</HI> are confessedly temporary —I answer, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these were not so many distinct Offices, they are only several Denominations, conferred on those Officers, that were in the Church before.</Q> Now, were this granted, what is it to the Purpose? Were not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, as well as <HI>Apostles,</HI> said to be <HI>set in the Church;</HI> and given for the perfecting the Saints, in the Text then under Consideration? Was not the fame Permanence predicated of these Offices and Gifts, or (if he please) Denominations; as of the <HI>Apostles?</HI> Let him therefore shew us <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Evangelists;</HI> let him shew us <HI>Miracles, Gifts of Heal∣ing,</HI> and <HI>Diversity of Tongues,</HI> in their <HI>Bishops,</HI> and I'll allow 'em to be <HI>Apostles.</HI>—But I must neverthe∣less
<PB N="98" REF="003651_0052_10023CB0C00C0A08"/>tell him, that this Notion of his, that these Gifts and Offices resided in the same Person, and that (as he too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldly asserts) <Q>the Work of an <HI>Evangelist, Prophet</HI> &amp;c. was common to every Minister,</Q> is as false as it is impertinent; and is expresly contra∣dicted by the <HI>Apostle</HI> himself, in the very following Words to those now considered, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 29, 30. <HI>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all Work∣ers of Miracles? Have all the Gifts of Healing? Do all speak with Tongues? Do all Interpret?</HI> No! if we may believe the <HI>Apostle</HI> in the 27th verse of the same Chapter, tho' these all belong <HI>to the Body of Christ, they are all Members in particular.</HI> So that either the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> or this Gentleman is cer∣tainly in a Mistake.</P>
<P>Thus I have particularly considered his first <HI>Pro∣position,</HI> upon which lies all the Stress of his whole Fabrick; and shewn that it is neither pertinent to his Purpose, nor true in Fact: and the rest of his Per∣formance must therefore necessarily be a Castle in the Air, his Foundation being wholly taken away.</P>
<P>I might indeed have taken a shorter Method with this Gentleman; and put him upon the utter Sub∣version of this <HI>Proposition</HI> with his own Hand. For if it be (as he tells us it is, in <HI>p.</HI> 24) <Q>a distinguishing Part of an <HI>Apostle's</HI> Character, that he be immedi∣ately called and ordained by Christ himself,</Q> it is evident to Demonstration, that none can be vested with that Character, but what have that immediate Call and Ordination. And what then becomes of his <HI>Succession,</HI> in the <HI>Essentials</HI> of the <HI>Apostolick Office?</HI> unless he pretends, that their <HI>Bishops</HI> are thus <HI>imme∣diately called,</HI> and ordained by Christ himself. It might be worthy of this Gentleman's Pains, to make Peace between these two jarring Propositions, That <HI>it's a distinguishing Part of an Apostle's Character, that he be immediately called and ordained by Christ himself:</HI> and yet that <HI>the Apostles have properly Suc∣cessors,
<PB N="99" REF="003651_0052_10023CB0C00C0A08"/>in the Essentials of the Apostolick Office.</HI> This certainly deserves Re-consideration.</P>
<P>HIs Second <HI>Proposition</HI> is (<HI>p.</HI> 35.) <Q>That it is not contrary to the Nature of the pastoral Office, or to the Gospel, to communicate the entire Pow∣ers to some Officers; and some Branches of it only to others." — But how does this appear? In this Opinion I am confirmed (says the Gentle∣man) because the Scripture supposes it may be done; and has left the Communicating the several Gifts, to the Discretion of the Ordainers, to distri∣bute them, as they find the Persons to be ordained, qualified to receive them.</Q>—The Scripture ap∣pealed to in this Case, is <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 6, 7, 8. <Q>Where (he tells us) the differing Branches of the pastor∣al Office are placed, not in the same, but differing Persons, <HI>Prophesying</HI> in one, <HI>Teaching</HI> in another, <HI>Exhorting</HI> in a third, <HI>Ministring</HI> in another, <HI>Ruling</HI> in another, according as they are qualified.</Q>—What a pity it is that this Gentleman has no better Me∣mory? It was but in the very last Page we were told that <Q>the Work of an Evangelist, PROPHET &amp;c. was common to every Minister.</Q> But now, when he has another Turn to serve, <Q>The differing Branches of the pastoral Office are placed, not in the same, but differing Persons; PROPHESYING in one, TEACHING in another &amp;c.</Q>—But the Truth on't is, that as he greatly mistook, in the for∣mer Part of his Contradiction, so is he in no less a Mistake, in the Application of the Text be∣fore us. For —</P>
<P>In the first Place, what if the <HI>Gifts</HI> here enume∣rated, were not any of them, <HI>Branches</HI> of the ordi∣nary <HI>pastoral Office</HI> at all; but <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Holy Ghost, extraordinarily, and occasionally communicated, for the Service of the Church in it's <HI>Infant</HI>-State? How
<PB N="100" REF="003651_0053_10023C763B5331E0"/>will it then help his Cause? I think he won't argue from those extraordinary Dispensations, to the ordinary standing Ministry in the Church. For those came not by their Authority, from the grand Com∣mission; but by immediate Inspiration. And that the Text before us did refer to <HI>Gifts</HI> thus immediately communicated, seems manifest to me; because we find the very same Enumeration of <HI>Gifts</HI> in 1 Cor. xii. 28. where the Apostle is professedly treating of the extraordinary Charismata, through that and the two immediately succeeding Chapters. And it's remark∣able that in both Places, the Consideration of these <HI>Gifts</HI> is introduced in the same Manner; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed in the same View, by an Argument from the <HI>Members of the Body</HI> natural, to these Members of the mystical Body of Christ: that in neither Case, any Member has Cause to despise another; because they belong to the <HI>same Body.</HI> Now then, if it be a good Rule, to <HI>compare Scripture with Scripture;</HI> and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make the Scripture it's own Interpreter, this Text it nothing to our Author's Purpose. I may add to this that one of the <HI>Gifts</HI> in this Enumeration, (the <HI>Gift of Prophecy</HI> I mean) is by all acknowledged, to be by immediate Inspiration; and I can see no Reason, why the others that are without Distinction joined with it in the Text, are not so too—Moreover, there are two of these <HI>Gifts,</HI> that certainly have no special Reference to any <HI>Office</HI> at all, viz. <HI>Giving,</HI> and <HI>Shew∣ing Mercy;</HI> which cannot be supposed to be appro∣priated to any particular Order of Christians: but it's certain, Men may by immediate Inspiration be excited and inclined to these Duties, as is exemplifi∣ed, <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 32. and then they are properly <HI>Gifts,</HI> as called in the Text; but why the rest of these <HI>Gifts</HI> must necessarily be distinct and separate <HI>Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the Christian Church, when these, that are without any Distinction, class'd with them in the same Enumerati∣on, have no Relation to any <HI>Office</HI> at all, I can see no Colour of Reason.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="003651_0053_10023C763B5331E0"/>But being willing to oblige this Gentleman as far as I can, I will even suppose, that these <HI>Gifts</HI> were not, all of them, given by immediate Inspiration; and that they were not in the same, but different Persons; he is not able to prove notwithstanding, above one of these, to belong to the ordinary <HI>pasto∣ral Office.—Prophesying</HI> must be allowed to be an ex∣traordinary <HI>Gift;</HI> and why mayn't the <HI>Ministry</HI> here mentioned, refer to <HI>Deacons,</HI> as it is called in the original <HI>the Deaconship?</HI> The <HI>Teaching</HI> refer to <HI>Catechists,</HI> the <HI>Exhorting</HI> to ordinary <HI>Pastors,</HI> the <HI>Ruling▪</HI> to <HI>Ruling Elders?</HI> His supposal, that they all belong to the ordinary <HI>pastoral Office,</HI> is altogether groundless. And I think my Interpretation of these Words is much more natural and easy, than that he has given.—If any object, against my making the <HI>Teachers</HI> to be <HI>Catechists,</HI> I must observe to 'em, that there certainly was such a sort of Instructor in the Apostles Times.</P>
<P>Hence th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Complaint of the Apostle, that <HI>those who for the Time ought to be</HI> TEACHERS, <HI>needed to be taught again, which be the first Principles of the Oracles of God, Heb.</HI> v. 12. From which Text it's apparent, that there were such <HI>Teachers</HI> in the Church, <HI>whose Business</HI> was to teach others which be the <HI>first Principles</HI> of the Oracles of God; i. e. in other Words, who were <HI>Catechists.</HI></P>
<P>He goes on to argue: <Q>That our Saviour founded his Church in an <HI>Imparity,</HI> both of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> must (I think) be acknowledged, if the <HI>twelve Apostles</HI> were superiour both in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> to the <HI>seventy Disciples.</HI></Q>—The Gentle∣man will be pleased to pardon me, that I cannot se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Consequence follow from his Premises. If it be supposed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were <HI>superiour</HI> both in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> to the <HI>seventy Disciples,</HI> it won't follow, that our Saviour founded his Church upon that Imparity; because the <HI>Christian Church</HI> was not founded at all, at the Time when these were
<PB N="102" REF="003651_0054_10023C699A3EC000"/>sent forth: but the <HI>Seventy's</HI> Commission expired before the <HI>Christian Church</HI> had any Being. The Argument may therefore be justly inverted. For i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>twelve Apostles</HI> were indeed <HI>superiour</HI> both in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> to the <HI>seventy Disciples,</HI> it appears that our Saviour did not found his Church upon an <HI>Imparity</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power;</HI> because he did not under the Gospel-Dispensation renew the Commissi∣on of the <HI>seventy,</HI> as he did the Commission of the <HI>Twelve.</HI> If it be supposed that there was an <HI>Impa∣rity</HI> in that their temporary Mission; yet our Savi∣our did not design that <HI>Imparity</HI> should continue after the <HI>Christian Church</HI> was founded; for the <HI>Se∣venty's</HI> Commission was then wholly dropt, and renewed no more. There was but one of these <HI>Or∣ders</HI> continued, as Ministers of the Christian Church.</P>
<P>I have, I think, made it clearly evident in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> that there was no <HI>Christian Church</HI> ex∣isting, when the <HI>seventy Disciples</HI> were sent upon their occasional Errand; that our Saviour himself and his Disciples, were Members of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church and actually submitted to all the Ordinances of it: but the <HI>Christian Church</HI> being founded upon his Resurrection, there could be no <HI>Ministers,</HI> nor in∣deed <HI>Members</HI> of this Church, before it had a Being, and that the Aposte assures us, that the <HI>New-Testament</HI> (and certainly then the new Dispensation therein revealed) depended upon the Death of the <HI>Testator,</HI> Heb. ix. 16, 17. <HI>For where a Testament is, there m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of Necessity be the Death of the Testator; otherwise it is of no Strength at all, while the Testator liveth.</HI> To which, my Antagonist has not seen Cause to give any Answer. To this I may add, that the <HI>Christian Church</HI> was founded, upon the Subversion of the <HI>legal Dispensation;</HI> which was principally to type and shadow forth Christ's Death and could not therefore be done away, till what was thereby pre∣figured was accomplished, in his Resurrection.—More∣over, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Gentleman's own Concession, it is
<PB N="103" REF="003651_0054_10023C699A3EC000"/>impossi∣ble the <HI>Seventy</HI> could be Ministers of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> without a new Commission: for he himself tells us <HI>(p. 36.)</HI> that <Q>the <HI>seventy</HI> were only sent before our Lord's Face, into the Cities and Places, whither he himself would come, (<HI>Luke</HI> x. 1.) to prepare the People for his Reception.</Q>—Is it so? How then came they to be <HI>Ministers</HI> in the <HI>Christian Church?</HI> Were they only <HI>sent before our Lord's Face?</HI> Then certainly they had neither Mission nor Com∣mission, after his Resurrection. Were they only sent where <HI>our Lord himself would come?</HI> Then their Mission was over, when he himself had been in the Places, whither he sent them. And before they could not from this limited Commission have any Ministry in the <HI>Gentile Churches.</HI> For this Author owns that <Q>after they Return'd to our Lord; and gave him an Account of their Success, in the Ex∣ecution of that Office, they were <HI>never once mentioned again.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Though my Antagonist did not think it proper in this Place, to make any Remarks, upon what was said upon this Subject in the <HI>Dialogue;</HI> yet before he has finished his Discourse, he tells us (p. 48.) <Q>He can't help being concerned for the Author, and his critical Inspectors; and reminds them of <HI>John</HI> iv. 1, 2. <HI>When therefore the Lord knew, how the</HI> Pharisees <HI>had heard, that</HI> Jesus <HI>had made and bap∣tized more Disciples than</HI> John, (<HI>tho'</HI> Jesus <HI>him∣self baptized not; but his Disciples.</HI>)—Whence he triumphs "What! did they <HI>baptize,</HI> who were not themselves <HI>Christians?</HI> I desire to know, if they were not Members of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> at what Time they were initiated.</Q>— But who ever said, that they were not themselves <HI>Christians?</HI> They might be <HI>Christians,</HI> and savingly united to Christ, during the continuance of the <HI>Jewish Church</HI>-State, and before the <HI>Christian Church</HI> had it's Ex∣istence. And as to his second Question, I answer, they
<PB N="104" REF="003651_0055_10023C6E99C59C48"/>belonged to the <HI>Christian Church</HI> immediately, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as there was such a Church; but not before.</P>
<P>Thus you see, that his Argument labours of a <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sequitur,</HI> if it be even supposed that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were <HI>Superiour,</HI> both in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> to the <HI>seventy Disciples.</HI> But if that also should prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mistake, what will become of his Cause? And that it will do so is certain from this Consideration, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there was no special Business, no peculiar Office, committed to the <HI>Twelve,</HI> that distinguished them from the <HI>Seventy;</HI> and therefore they could not by that Commission, be <HI>Superiour</HI> in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> This Gentleman undertakes to prove the contrary But <HI>allowing</HI> all that he asserts; allowing that the <HI>Twelve</HI> were ordained to be with our Lord, and were his constant Attendants; allowing, that the <HI>Twelve</HI> were by Commission to preach to all the Jews, the <HI>Seventy</HI> only to the Places where ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord would come; allowing, that the Inauguration of the <HI>Seventy</HI> was not so solemn as that of the Twelve; allowing, that the <HI>Twelve</HI> were distin∣guished by the Name of <HI>Apostles,</HI> the <HI>Seventy</HI> only called <HI>Disciples:</HI> and allowing that the <HI>Apostles</HI> are constantly called the <HI>Twelve,</HI> whereas had they been all equal, they must have been <HI>eighty two</HI> allowing, I say, all this (tho' it be a great deal more than is true) all the Preference thereby allowed to the <HI>Twelve,</HI> is only in <HI>Honour,</HI> not in <HI>Order</HI> They have no distinct <HI>Office,</HI> they have no distinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Errand</HI> in that Mission. In a Word, they have n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> distinct <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction;</HI> and therefore what ever Superiority is supposed, will make nothing to the Purpose.</P>
<P>HE next proceeds, to examine the Reasoning in the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> from the grand Ministerial <HI>Com∣mission;</HI> But has according to his usual Method, dis∣covered
<PB N="105" REF="003651_0055_10023C6E99C59C48"/>his Prudence, in overlooking the Arguments there offered; and in contesting with imaginary Objections, of his own framing. <Q>Supposing (says he, <HI>p</HI> 37.) what this Author contends for, that this was the <HI>Commission,</HI> by virtue of which the Apostles ordained their Successors in the Ministry: Supposing (I say) that this was the full <HI>Commissi∣on</HI> of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> all the Ends of it might be an∣swered, by their appointing different <HI>Orders,</HI> for different <HI>Offices</HI> in the Church: nor will it at all follow, that this is the <HI>Commission</HI> of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in such Sense, as that they are impowered by it to ordain others, because the <HI>Apostles</HI> were.</Q>—But he should have carried his Supposals a little further; and not only supposed, that this was the full <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>Apostles:</HI> but that it was the <HI>only Commission,</HI> by which all the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel are autho∣rized, to the Exercise of their Ministry; and the <HI>only Commission</HI> by which the Gospel-Ministry is to con∣tinue, and Christ's promised Presence secured to them, unto the End of the World. And then it would follow, that <HI>they</HI> were impowered by this <HI>Commission,</HI> to <HI>ordain</HI> others, because the <HI>Apostles</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere; whatever this Author thinks of it. I therefore once more provoke him, to answer the Arguments in the <HI>Dialogue.</HI> If <HI>Presbyters</HI> are not included in the <HI>Com∣mission,</HI> whence have they their Existence? If they are included in this only <HI>Commission</HI> to the Ministry, whence are their Superiours? Since the <HI>Commission</HI> is but one, there can be but one <HI>Order</HI> by virtue of that <HI>Commission.</HI> If <HI>Bishops</HI> are the <HI>Apostles Successors,</HI> and have in this <HI>Commission</HI> the Promise of Christ's perpe∣tual Presence, there are no <HI>Presbyters</HI> inferiour to them; If <HI>Presbyters</HI> are the Subjects of this Promise, there are no <HI>Bishops</HI> superiour to them: If both are includ∣ed, they have both the same <HI>Order,</HI> and have both the same Authority. He tells us indeed (<HI>p.</HI> 38.) <Q>that the <HI>Apostles</HI> by virtue of this very <HI>Com∣mission,</HI> might have appointed some Persons to <HI>bap∣tize,</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="003651_0056_10023C7810C0BA10"/>others only to <HI>teach;</HI> and others indued with all these Powers.</Q>—That is, tho' the Lord Jesus Christ himself has given <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Powers,</HI> committe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Work</HI> of the Gospel-Ministry, without Differ∣ence or Distinction, to every <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel yet the <HI>Apostles</HI> might by virtue of the same <HI>Commissi∣on,</HI> by which this was done, appoint some to the Exercise of all these <HI>Powers;</HI> and others to be Part of them. Or in other Words, they might by virtue of this <HI>Commission,</HI> vacate the <HI>Commission</HI> it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and change the Purport and Tenour of it.</P>
<P>I would gladly know of this Gentleman, whether <HI>Presbyters</HI> are authorized at all by this <HI>Commission,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not. If they are, where is the limiting Clause, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which they are barred the Exercise of all the <HI>Powers</HI> that are thereby communicated? If they are not, where is there any Promise of their continued Succe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sion; or of Christ's gracious Presence with them?</P>
<P>But he insinuates, that there is no Ground to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that this was the <HI>Apostles</HI> full <HI>Commission;</HI> and tell us, that <Q>their Direction and <HI>Commission</HI> to orda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>might be</HI> given them afterwards, by the Holy Ghost.</Q>—And are all his high Pretences dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dled to this at last, <HI>It might be So?</HI> He is verily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sanguine to suppose, that we will allow for Fact, whatever he can imagine <HI>might be:</HI> some Evidence of this is therefore wanting, to establish his Cause <Q>He desires to know, by what <HI>Commission, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> did ordain <HI>Presbyters.</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can't discover (he tells us) that it was by virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>grand Commission.</HI></Q> And in Answer, I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sire to know also, by <HI>what Commission</HI> they acted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not by the <HI>grand Commission.</HI> If they had any other let him produce it; and that will end the Debate but if none can be produced, his shortsightedne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in making Discoveries carries no Conviction with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But if this Supposal was granted him, it would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far from serviceable, that it would intirely subvert h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> whole Scheme. Be it supposed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="107" REF="003651_0056_10023C7810C0BA10"/>not <HI>ordain</HI> by virtue of the <HI>grand Commission,</HI> without the immediate Directions of the Holy Ghost, it will then necessarily follow, that their <HI>Bishops</HI> can't <HI>or∣dain,</HI> by virtue of the <HI>grand Commission,</HI> without the <HI>like Directions</HI> of the Holy Ghost; for I think he won't pretend, that they have greater Authority than the <HI>Apostles</HI> had. Let 'em then wait for a <HI>new Commission,</HI> or for immediate Inspiration, before they pretend to monopolize the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Ordination,</HI> to themselves. I can't foresee, how he will get clear of this Difficulty.</P>
<P>And now he tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 39.) he'll give a Solu∣tion to the Question, If <HI>Presbyters</HI> are not in the <HI>Commission,</HI> whence have they their Existence? <Q>He answers, from the Will of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> declar∣ed about them.—And it is as much for the good of the Christian Church, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> (who acted by the same Spirit) should declare the <HI>Com∣mission</HI> of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as that our Lord himself should.</Q>—But I demand, what is the Will of the <HI>Apostles</HI> declared about them? Where is this <HI>Com∣mission,</HI> that the <HI>Apostles</HI> have given to <HI>Presbyters?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s there any Thing any where declared about them, or any <HI>Commission</HI> given to 'em, that abridges them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Exercise of all the <HI>Powers,</HI> granted by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rand Commission?</HI> Are they any where considered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Inferiour Order in the Church? He would have done well to have shewn us, where this Decla∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion of the Apostles Will might be found. If there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any <HI>Commission</HI> at all, that secures to <HI>Presbyters</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinuance in the Church, distinct from the <HI>Commissi∣on</HI> under Consideration, I should be glad to know there to find it.</P>
<P>We are next entertain'd with very diverting In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrogations. <Q>If <HI>Presbyters</HI> were impowered by this <HI>Commission</HI> to ordain, (says the Gentleman) how came they in several Churches, to be restrained by the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves; and denied the Exercise of this Right, immediately after this <HI>Commission</HI> was
<PB N="108" REF="003651_0057_10023C9F31D59568"/>given them?</Q>—Here he is at the old Sport again of proposing his own Imaginations for Matters of Fact without the least shadow of Proof to support them. But I must tell him, that I have no Disposition to Philosophise upon the golden Tooth. It's Time e∣nough to consider his Questions, when he can prove the Facts. In the Interim, I hope his Argument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be harmless enough, while they are only th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Product of his own Fancy. And the same may be said, with Respect to <HI>the constant disapproving, con∣demning, and denying the Right of Presbyters t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ordain, in the primitive Church.</HI> We cannot tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Word in this Case. The contrary to his Suppo∣sals, is notoriously true. And I again challeng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Author, to produce so much as one single clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and full Proof, from the first Ages of the Church that <HI>Bishops</HI> were then esteemed to be <HI>by Divi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Right,</HI> and Order superiour to <HI>Presbyters.</HI> But of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more hereafter.</P>
<P>ANd now we are come to his <HI>third</HI> Proposition, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chief thing intended. (<HI>p.</HI> 40.) He is now to prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <Q>that the <HI>Apostles</HI> did thus divide the <HI>pastoral Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and ordain'd some to the whole Power, such as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now denominate <HI>Bishops;</HI> others to Part of it onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as we call <HI>Presbyters</HI>—Bishops, were <HI>Timot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Titus, Epaphroditus</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="109" REF="003651_0057_10023C9F31D59568"/>Does their Cause admit of no Evidence, that we must always be put off with bare Assertions and Suppo∣sitions? Has he proved, or can he prove, that <HI>Timothy</HI> ever ordain'd any <HI>Presbyters</HI> at <HI>Ephesus</HI> at all? I'm sure the Scriptures are altogether silent as to this Matter. Much less then can he prove, that he did this, when there were <HI>Presbyters</HI> already settled there. It is to carry his Imaginations a great deal too far, to suppose, because <HI>Timothy</HI> has Directions about ordaining, that therefore he was to ordain <HI>Elders</HI> at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> when it does not appear, that he was so much as resident at <HI>Ephesus</HI> On the contrary, it appears manifest to me, that <HI>Timothy</HI> never was <HI>Bi∣shop of Ephesus,</HI> or resident there, from the very Text commonly brought to prove that he was, 1 Tim. i. 3. <HI>For this End, I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia</HI> &amp;c.

And as to <HI>Titus,</HI> how is it proved, that there were <HI>Presbyters</HI> settled at <HI>Crete,</HI> before he was left at that Island! All the Evidence of this is, that this Gen∣tleman <HI>supposes</HI> it; and therefore it <HI>must</HI> be so? But why is <HI>Titus</HI> left at <HI>Crete</HI> to ordain Elders in every City, if they had Elders already ordained, and were already supply'd? However, were it even supposed, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were actually improved in ordaining <HI>Elders</HI> in those Churches, where there were <HI>Presbyters</HI> already settled, there might be great Want of the superiour <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> of these ex∣traordinary Persons, in that infant State of the Church; even tho' the <HI>Presbyters</HI> were of the same <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> with them.</P>
<P>But since <HI>Scripture</HI>-Evidence fails, he appeals to <HI>Antiquity;</HI> and assures us (<HI>p.</HI> 41.) that <Q>this was the Opinion of the primitive <HI>Fathers,</HI> who unani∣mously agree, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> made <HI>Timothy Bishop of Ephesus,</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> of <HI>Crete.</HI></Q> To prove which, he quotes <HI>Eusebius</HI> Lib. 3. c. 4. and names St. <HI>Jerom, Isidore, Theodoret, Sedulius</HI> &amp;c.

He goes on in these Words <Q>And the Fathers of the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> including <HI>Timothy</HI> in the Number, reckon twenty seven Bishops of <HI>Ephesus</HI> to their Time.</Q> I have often met with this Testimony; to prove <HI>Timothy</HI> to have been Bishop of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> but I never yet read it without surprise, that any Man should have the Face to produce it, as the Testimony of the <HI>Fathers of this Council;</HI> when nothing is more plain than that 'tis the Testimony only of <HI>Leontius,</HI> a single Member of that, Council, who was actually Convicted of a gross mistake before this very Council in the <HI>main Point</HI> for which he offer'd these words. Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet's</HI> Thoughts upon this head are worth transcribing; but for Bre∣vity I shall only refer you to the Place (<HI>Ireni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> pag. 302.) from whence you will learn that my Antago∣nist is guilty of a gross Misrepresentation. I think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerns him to free himself of this Charge, and if he can't do it, fairly to retract his Mistake.— But sup∣pose it the unanimous voice of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> that <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were <HI>Bishops,</HI> the one of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and the other of <HI>Crete;</HI> will it therefore follow, that the, <HI>primitive Fathers</HI> esteemed them <HI>superiour</HI> to <HI>Presbyters?</HI> Don't this Author grant (<HI>p.</HI> 16.) that <Q>the Duties and Qualifications of those called <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New Testament, and those called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are the same.</Q> And it is but suppos∣ing, that the <HI>primitive Fathers</HI> used the Word <HI>Bishop,</HI> in the same Sense that the Scriptures do; and all these great Appearances from <HI>Antiquity,</HI> would va∣nish into nothing, had all the <HI>Fathers</HI> proclaimed it with one Voice. And if we can find those very <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> by him cited, speaking as plain as can be ex∣pressed by Words, that a <HI>Presbyter</HI> is the same with a <HI>Bishop</HI> by divine Appointment, his Cause surely cannot be much strengthned, by this appeal to Antiquity. Let him then read <HI>Jerom's</HI> Epistle to <HI>Evagrius,</HI> and his Commentary upon <HI>Titus;</HI> and he will find him not only asserting, but largely
<PB N="113" REF="003651_0059_10023C8296EF8948"/>proving, the Identity of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter.</HI> Let him read <HI>Primasius</HI> upon 1 Tim. iii and he will find him there asserting, that <HI>Bishop and Presbyter are the same Degree.</HI> Let him read <HI>Theodoret</HI> upon the same Chapter and he will tell him, that <HI>of old, they called the same Men both Bishops and Presbyters.</HI> And let him read <HI>Sedulius</HI> on Tit. i and he will find him asserting the Identity of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> both Name and Office. Thus has he been helped out with the Authority of the Fathers.</P>
<P>I have been forced already to outdo my intended Brevity: and shall not spend Time, in partic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly examining h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discourse about the Character of <HI>Evan∣gelists.</HI> He agrees, that <HI>they were Missionaries, travel∣ling to convert Infidels;</HI> and consequently, that they must be furnished with Gifts, Graces and Powers, adapted to that Service. He agrees, that <HI>Timothy</HI> had the Work of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> committed to him. And therefore I would fain know, if <HI>Timothy</HI> was a <HI>Mis∣sionary,</HI> travelling to convert Infidels (which is his own Description of an <HI>Evangelist</HI>) how he could be a <HI>fixed Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ephesus!</HI>— But here is something of a peculiar Nature asserted by him, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Deacons</HI> may be <HI>Evangelists;</HI> and yet he owns that it's the Work of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> to <HI>preach the Word, be instant in Season and out of Season, to reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering and doctrine.</HI> And is this the Work of a <HI>Deacon?</HI> If we look to their original Institution it <HI>Acts</HI> vi. we find them appointed only to <HI>serve Tables</HI> (as I observed before) that so others might attend upon the Word of God, and not be forced to leave it. If we look to the Qualifications, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> thought necessary for 'em, in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. where he is purposely, and distinctly de∣scribing them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is no Mention of their <HI>preaching.</HI> How then may they be <HI>Evangelists?</HI> or which is all one by this Gentleman's Account of the Matter, how are they <HI>Preachers?</HI> Let him, if he can, produce any better Argument for it, than this: There was
<PB N="114" REF="003651_0060_10023C5B8D0FB060"/>one <HI>Deacon,</HI> who <HI>afterwards</HI> became an <HI>Evangelist:</HI> therefore all <HI>Deacons,</HI> while such, are <HI>Evangelists.</HI></P>
<P>I Have already considered the Gentleman's Appeal to <HI>Antiquity,</HI> to prove the <HI>Episcopacy</HI> of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> (which he comes over with again, <HI>p.</HI> 43.) and may therefore securely leave him to erect his Trophies, and carry on his Triumphs, on Account of his imaginary Victory. For I will allow him, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were <HI>Bishops,</HI> vested with all the Powers, that he himself supposes belong to those call∣ed <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the New-Testament: I will grant also, that such <HI>Bishops</HI> as these were fixed, in more than some of the Churches, in the Days of the <HI>Apos∣tles:</HI> But it is his Business to prove, that these <HI>Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> were, according to the <HI>primitive Fathers,</HI> of an Or∣der <HI>superiour</HI> to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and universally held to be so <HI>by Divine Right.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Gentleman perhaps will accuse me of Neglect, if I pass over some remarkable Passages he has in <HI>page</HI> 44.—One is that, <Q>And in these (the primitive Fathers) there is such a constancy and unanimity, that even St. <HI>Jerom</HI> himself, (who was born near 250 years after the Apostles, and is the chief Person in all that time whom the Presbyterians cite for any purpose of theirs) traces up Episcopacy to the very <HI>Apostles;</HI> and makes it of their Institu∣tion.</Q> This Gentleman surely could not but know, if he ever read any thing on the Presbyterian side of the Question, that <HI>Jerom</HI> is not <HI>the chief Person</HI> they cite in their Cause. They have much greater depen∣dance upon more primitive Writers, and as frequently quote <HI>Clemens Romanus, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Ire∣naeus.</HI> And notwithstanding the <HI>Constancy and Unani∣mity</HI> he speaks of, he has not seen good to bring one passage from either of these <HI>Fathers</HI> of the first and second Centuries: nor dare he venture the Controversy
<PB N="115" REF="003651_0060_10023C5B8D0FB060"/>upon their <HI>Judgment,</HI> or <HI>Account of facts.</HI> What he here says of <HI>Jerom,</HI> that <HI>he traces up Episcopacy to the very Apostles, and makes it their Institution,</HI> is (to give it the softest) name, a palpable mistake if we may be∣lieve <HI>Jerom</HI> himself, whose opinion of this matter I shall give you in his own words. "<HI>And before there were parties in Religion by the Devil's instinct, and it was said among the People, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>I am of</HI> Apol∣los, <HI>I of</HI> Cephas, <HI>the Churches were govern'd by the common Council of Presbyters. But after every one tho't those he baptized to be rather his, than Christ's, it was determined in the whole World, that one of the Presby∣ters should be set above the rest, to whom all the care of the Church should belong, and the seeds of Division taken away. If</HI> ANY ONE SHOULD THINK IT OUR OPI∣NION AND NOT THAT OF THE SCRIPTURES, <HI>that Bishops and Presbyter are the same, and that one is the name of Age and the other of Office, let him read &amp;c.</HI>— And here he quotes most of those very Texts, which are urged by Presbyterians, to prove it the Doctrine of the Scripture, that Bishop &amp; Presbyter are the same. Having done which, he adds, "<HI>These things are alledg∣ed, that we might shew that among the Ancients, the Pres∣byters were the same with Bishops; but by</HI> LITTLE AND LITTLE <HI>the whole care was devolved on one, that the Seeds of dissention might be plucked up. As therefore the Presbyters know, that</HI> BY THE CUSTOM OF THE CHURCH, <HI>they are subject to him who is the President; so let the</HI> BISHOPS KNOW, THAT THEY ARE ABOVE PRESBYTERS MORE BY THE CUSTOM OF THE CHURCH, THAN THE REAL APPOINTMENT OF THE LORD, <HI>and that they ought to rule the Church in com∣mon—</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hieron.</HI> Comment. in Tit. Tom 9. pag. 103. Eras. Edit.</NOTE> I might fill several pages with quotations of a like import. His whole Epistle to <HI>Evagr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> is a vindication of the <HI>Divine Parity</HI> of Bishop and Presby∣ter; nor does he more fully and plainly express him∣self in any one thing, than that Episcopacy was not of

<P>Our Author goes on, <Q>And in the very place where he most exalts Presbyters, he excepts Ordi∣nation as a Work always peculiar to Bishops.</Q> This is not a fair Representation. The words are, <HI>Quid enim fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it excepta ordinatione Episcopus, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Presbyter nonfaciat? What except Ordination does a Bishop, that a Presbyter may not do?</HI> 'Tis readily ac∣knowledg'd, <HI>Jerom</HI> here speaks of Ordination as the appropriate work of Bishops: But does he say, it was <HI>always</HI> thus? no such thing: so far from it, that in this very Epistle, he mentions <HI>Timothy</HI> as a <HI>Scripture</HI> Instance of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination,</HI> and argues here from the <HI>parity</HI> of Bishops and Presbyters according to Divine Institution. So that unless we should suppose this learned Father so very forgetful, as to be guilty of a gross self-contradiction within a few lines, it can∣not be imagined he is here to be understood as mean∣ing, that Ordination was <HI>always</HI> the peculiar work of Bishops in distinction from Presbyters. Nay, in the very Paragraph in which these words are found, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e speaks of Episcopacy as the Custom of <HI>After-times,</HI> and fallen into as a <HI>Remedy against Schisin</HI> So that when in this passage he <HI>appropriates</HI> Ordination to Bishops, he speaks only of the <HI>prevailing Custom</HI> in his day, not of any <HI>Apostolic Institution;</HI> for this is what he had expresly disclaimed.</P>
<P>Our Author having thus misrepresented the opinion of <HI>Jerom,</HI> its no wonder, in the next words, he should do the same by Mr. <HI>Baxter.</HI> He brings him in <Q>own∣ing thus much at least, that there were fix'd Bishops in the days of one of the Apostles; that neither the Apostles nor any of their Disciples, nor any Christian or Heretick in the World, spoke or wrote a word against Episcopacy till long after it was ge∣nerally settled in the Churches.</Q> Words to this purpose, I grant, are to be found in Mr. <HI>Baxter:</HI> But here lies the fallacy. This Gentleman is writing in
<PB N="117" REF="003651_0061_1002024A976F0218"/>favour of the Episcopacy of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and would make his Readers believe, Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> had assert∣ed the universal prevalence of <HI>this Species</HI> of Ecclesi∣astical Government; Whereas this is so far from the Truth, that this <HI>great Man</HI> really tho't <HI>Diocesan</HI> Epis∣copacy utterly subversive of <HI>Parochial,</HI> which he not only affirms to be the only <HI>Scriptural</HI> and <HI>primitive</HI> Episcopacy; but has wrote a large Volume<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Treatise of Episcopacy.</NOTE> to prove it, in opposition to that of the <HI>Church of England:</HI> Nor has his Treatise upon this Head ever yet received a just Answer, neither do I think it ever can.</P>
<P>He concludes this Paragraph with a Challenge, <Q>to instance any Christian Church for 1500 Years with∣out Presbyters and Deacons subordinate to their Bishop.</Q> In answer whereto, I pitch upon <HI>every Church,</HI> within the two first Centuries, throughout the Christian World, that we know any thing of, as In∣stances; and return back the Challenge, defying this Gentleman to produce, within the limits of this time, upon genuine Authority, one single Church, that had in it Presbyters in Subordination to their Bishop, <HI>after the manner of the Church of</HI> Eng∣land. And I challenge him yet further, to produce, if he can, only a single instance, within the same term, of <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordination: which I the rather insist upon, because he makes this <HI>essential</HI> to the validity of Gospel Administrations. Nor, unless he be able to bring an instance of <HI>this kind</HI> of Ordination, will he have much reason to boast of the <HI>unanimity</HI> of the primitive Fathers on this Point: and much less to make any further use of that trite saying of <HI>Vincentius Lirinensis,</HI> which without the least appearance of truth, he cites in his Cause.</P>

ANd now I must submit to be catechized by him, and to answer such Questions as he is pleased to pro∣pose. But I must observe to him, that they are the very same Questions, upon which the <HI>Protestants</HI> are chal∣lenged by the <HI>Papists,</HI> the Change of Character being only supposed; and the same Answer will serve in both Cases. It is queried; (<HI>p.</HI> 44)</P>
<P N="1">1. When the episcopal <HI>Usurpation</HI> began?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It began in <HI>Diotrephes,</HI> and increased as <HI>Antichrist</HI> grew in Stature.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where it began, whether in a particular Church, or few Churches at first; or all at once, thro' the universal Church?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Just where <HI>Antichrist</HI> was born, and nou∣rished.</P>
<P N="3">3. If it began in particular Churches, how, or by what Steps, it made it's Progress all over the Christian Churches?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It did <HI>eat as does a Canker,</HI> gradually and insensibly; and the <HI>Enemy scattered the Tares, while Men Slept.</HI>—But what means this Enquiry? Is it impossible that this should obtain, unless <HI>we</HI> can tell the particular Steps by which it advanced? Is it not evident to all the World, that <HI>Popery</HI> it self did get the Ascendant, over almost all the Churches? And must we not believe our Senses in a plain Matter of Fact, unless we can assign the particular <HI>Methods,</HI> by which it came to pass?</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether it can be supposed, that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> then living, could be all, or most of them, ignorant of the Powers belonging to them of original Right?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The first <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was but a <HI>classical Pre∣sidency,</HI> without any Pretence of <HI>Superiority</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power;</HI> whence the <HI>Encroachments</HI> were made <HI>insensibly,</HI> and without Observation. This Question is therefore nothing to the Purpose. And the same Answer serves for the 5th and 6th Question.</P>
<P N="7">7. How can it be accounted for, that there should be no Mention, or fuller Relation, of so great an
<PB N="119" REF="003651_0062_10023C8531F7DAD8"/><HI>Usurpation,</HI> to be found in Record, in ecclesiastical History?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We have an Account in ecclesiastical Histo∣ry, how from <HI>Episcopus Praeses,</HI> there arose <HI>Episcopus Princeps;</HI> and how from the Moderator of a Classical Assembly, the Hierarchy advanced by Degrees, till the <HI>Pope</HI> was mounted upon the <HI>Seven headed Beast.</HI> Just as Purgatory, Image-Worship, and Invocation of Saints, were gradually advanced in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I'll transcribe for this Gentle∣man's Satisfaction, and leave him to apply, Part of an Answer made to these Demands from the Roman Catholicks. <Q>When <HI>Arius, Nestorius,</HI> and such like Hereticks arose, they violently broke out of the Church; and forsook all Communion. And when <HI>Mahomet</HI> came from without, he visibly assaulted all Christianity. But the <HI>Papacy</HI> bred silently, as a Gangreen in the Church within; that <HI>Cocka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice</HI> was long a hatching in the Shell, before it did appear. It was a secret Departure from the Truth, caused by Errors stollen into the Church, <HI>sensim sine Sensu,</HI> insensibly and unawares. Whence ap∣pears the Difference between open Heresy and clandestine Apostacy; the one is easy to be known, because it works openly, in the Day; the other hard to be discovered, because it makes it's ap∣proaches only in the Night.</Q>—Thus I have an∣swered his Questions. And if he' thinks the Answers bear too hard upon the <HI>episcopal Usurpation,</HI> I can't help it; he himself is the Occasion of it. But it must be remembred, that as he says nothing of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in general in his Questions, neither do I in my An∣swers. 'Tis of the <HI>Usurpation,</HI> that we are now treating.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="003651_0063_10023C86E65C7AF8"/>
I Am now again called upon to consider his Argu∣ments from <HI>Antiquity.</HI> "Had this Gentleman (says he, <HI>p.</HI> 45.) <Q>been a little more inquisitive, and not (depending upon the Authority of others) neglected examining the Epistles of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> an <HI>Apostolick Father,</HI> he might have met with one asserting the <HI>Superiority</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> by divine Right. To omit the plain and manifest Distinction he makes between them in every one of his Epistles, hear what he says, in that to the <HI>Philadelphians</HI> "For as many as are of God, and of Jesus Christ, are also with their <HI>Bishop.</HI> Again, There is but one Flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and but one Cup in the Unity of his Blood, one Altar, as also there is one <HI>Bishop.</HI> He compares the <HI>Bishop</HI> to the Father, in his Epistle to the <HI>Trallians.</HI> In his Epistle to the <HI>Magnesians,</HI> he exhorts them to reverence the <HI>Bishop,</HI> according to the Power of God the Father.</Q>—Our Author is so quick Sighted, it seems, as to find <HI>Ignatius</HI> here asserting the <HI>Superiority</HI> of Bishops to Presbyters, by <HI>Divine Right.</HI> But I think there is nothing more plainly discoverable than the direct contrary to this, even from those very Passages, now in view For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If <HI>Ignatius</HI> intends no more by <HI>Bishop,</HI> but a <HI>Congregational Bishop,</HI> or which is all one, but a meer <HI>Presbyter</HI> both in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> I think his Patronage can be of but little Service to our Adversaries. And this appears manifest, from this Gentleman's own Concessions. For he grants, that <Q><HI>Presbyters</HI> are those Church-Officers, that are called <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New Testament,</Q> <HI>p.</HI> 16. Now if <HI>Ignatius</HI> was an <HI>Apostolical Father</HI> (as he calls him) what Reason can be given, why he did not use the Word <HI>Bishop</HI> in the same Sense, that the Apostles used it? My Antagonist grants <Q>that the Duties and Qualifications of those called <HI>Bishops</HI> in the New Testament, and of those called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are the same.</Q> And why are not the Duties and Qualifi∣cations
<PB N="121" REF="003651_0063_10023C86E65C7AF8"/>of those called <HI>Bishops</HI> by <HI>Ignatius,</HI> and those called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> the same? Verily 'twould tempt one to think so, when we find him speaking of <HI>their coming all into one Place;</HI> asserting <HI>that he that com∣eth not to the same Place, is proud and condemneth him∣self;</HI> and exhorting <HI>all to come together, as into the Temple of God, as unto one Altar.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ep. to the Ephes. Voss. Edit.</NOTE> When we find him asserting, that there is <HI>one Altar, as also one Bi∣shop, with the Presbytery and the Deacons my fellow-Servants.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ep. to the Philad.</NOTE> Exhorting that <HI>none manage any Church-Affair, without the Bishop;</HI> and affirming, that <HI>it is not lawful without the Bishop, either to baptize, or to make love Feasts</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ep. to Smyrn.</NOTE> and also exhorting <HI>Polycarp, Bi∣shop</HI> of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to <HI>keep frequent Congregations, to en∣quire after all by Name; and not despise Men-Servants and Maid Servants.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ep. to Polycarp.</NOTE> From all which it is evident to Demonstration, that <HI>Ignatius's Bishop</HI> had the Charge of but a single Congregation; and that all sacred Ordinances were administred by him only. If it be demanded, Who then were the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> by him so often mentioned? I answer, They were <HI>Ru∣ling Elders.</HI> For tho' they are often consider'd in these Epistles, as being concern'd in Government, yet never as having any Authority to <HI>preach,</HI> or ad∣minister the <HI>Sacraments.</HI> Nay, we are expresly told, that <HI>it is not lawful to baptize without the Bishop,</HI> as was observed before.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppose after all, that there was in <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Time, a Difference made between <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Pres∣byters:</HI> Was it a Difference in <HI>Order?</HI> Were there any superiour <HI>Powers</HI> pretended to by Divine Right? Nothing of this is to be found in all his Epistles. I grant, that the Name <HI>Bishop</HI> was in the early Ages of the Church, appropriated to the Chief <HI>Presbyter,</HI> who was made the Constant <HI>Moderator</HI> of their <HI>Pres∣byteries;</HI> but without any Pretence of claim to a
<PB N="122" REF="003651_0064_10023C9A3A23F8E0"/><HI>superiority</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Power,</HI> above the other Mi∣nisters of the World. And what is this to the Case in Hand?</P>
<P>I have all along considered these Epistles of <HI>Igna∣tius,</HI> as genuine; (which we have Reason to wish they were;) because I was willing to allow the utmost Force of this Gentleman's Arguments. Tho', it has been abundantly proved by many learned Men, that they are all spurious, or vilely interpolated: The Evi∣dence of this is at our Author's Service, when he'll be pleased to call for it. And thus I have passed the Pikes of <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Epistles; and have given a suffi∣cient Answer to all this Gentleman's fine Flourishes, about the <HI>Necessity of depending upon the Fathers, is a simple Matter of Fact:</HI> For it would have been soon enough for his pathetical Harangue, when he had first proved from the truly <HI>primitive Fathers,</HI> not that there were then <HI>Bishops</HI> in the Church (this is acknowledged on both Sides) But that these w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>superiour</HI> to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> upon the foot of a <HI>Divine Right,</HI> universally professed.</P>
<P>However, he has here one Thing more, I will bestow some Observations upon. I had adduc'd several <HI>Canons,</HI> agreed on at the 4th, Council of <HI>Carthage;</HI> Upon which the Gentleman observes (<HI>p.</HI> 47.) <Q>And what then? therefore Prebyters can ordain! no such thing.</Q> If he had cast the slightest glance on that part of the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> he might have seen, that those <HI>Canons</HI> were bro't, not to prove Ordination by Presbyters, but that there was not in that day "so great a distance between Bishops and Presbyters, as there is now; and that nothing was done without the mutual concurrence of the Presby∣ters with their President": which stands validly col∣lected from those Canons, notwithstanding his remark. But perhaps my Opponent wanted an Opportunity to introduce that Apostolical Canon (as 'tis call'd) <HI>"Let a Bishop be ordained by two or three Bishops, a Priest by one Bishop, and so likewise a Deacon";</HI> and to let us know
<PB N="123" REF="003651_0064_10023C9A3A23F8E0"/>that he tho't it, <HI>"a very instructive Canon".</HI> I'll present him with a few more of those Canons, and leave it with him to determine, whether they are not full as <HI>Apostolical,</HI> if not quite so <HI>instructive.</HI> Can. 2. <HI>If any Bishop or Presbyter, besides what our Lord has appoint∣ed for Sacrifice, shall offer upon the Altar any other things, as Honey, or Milk &amp;c. let him be deposed. Ex∣cepting Ears of Corn, or Grapes, 'tis not lawful to offer any thing upon the Altar, save only Oyl for the holy Lamps, and incense in time of divine Oblation.</HI> Can. 13. <HI>He that hath been twice married after Baptism, or hath had a Concubine, cannot be a Bishop or Presbyter, or at all in the Catalogue of the Priesthood.</HI> Can. 19. <HI>Of those who were single Persons, when they were made Clergymen, we command that only Readers and Singers may take Wives.</HI> Can. 23. <HI>If any Bishop has made use of the Princes of this World, and by their influence has got into the Church, let him be deposed, and all that communicate with him.</HI> Can. 64. <HI>If any one of the Clergy or Laity shall take from the holy Church, either Wax or Oyl, let him be se∣parated, and add a fifth part to what he took away.</HI> Can. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. <HI>If any one has a Devil, he may not be made a Clergyman, nor may he pray with the faithful, &amp;c.</HI> These are all of them as truly <HI>Apostolical</HI> Canons, as that which this Gentleman has tho't fit to produce; and if he does not think they are <HI>instructive</HI> ones, he must allow us to guess at the reason, and chuse whe∣ther we will pay any greater regard to that which he calls the first in order among them.</P>
<P>I shall take leave upon this occasion to desire this Gentleman's Resolution of one or two Questions, viz. Whether the <HI>twenty third</HI> among the Apostolical Ca∣nons, be not of as good Authority as the <HI>first?</HI> And if it be, whether there be not just the same reason, that <HI>all the Bishops in England should at once be deposed, and all in Communion with them,</HI> as that Presbyterians should submit to Episcopal Ordination? And if the <HI>thirteenth</HI> and <HI>nineteenth</HI> Canons are of any validity, whether most of the Clergy of the establish'd Church,
<PB N="124" REF="003651_0065_10023CA137FB6008"/>do not stand as much condemned by them, as others do by the <HI>first?</HI></P>
<P>I shall only add, 'tis a shameful piece of Conduct in those of the <HI>Church,</HI> who call upon us to express our Regards to such of those Canons, as they think favour their Cause; while at the same time they treat most of these very Canons with the utmost practical Contempt. Let them lead in a punctual observance of them all, and then we may possibly think them serious, when they recommend some of them to our Consideration.</P>
<P>WE now come to his last <HI>Proposition.</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 48.) <Q>That, supposing all the Arguments urged in De∣fence of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination,</HI> were incontesta∣bly true; yet modern <HI>Presbyterian Ordination</HI> must be null and void." In Proof of which he tells us, 'Tis too well known to require Proof, that the true state of the Controversy, between us and the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> depends upon the State of the Mi∣nisterial Office, at the Time of the Reformation. —The Question is not, whether such as were called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in the Times of the New Testa∣ment, had the Power of Ordination: but the Question we are concerned about is this, whether such as were called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> at the Time of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> had the Power of Ordination.</Q> That they had not, he supposes evident; because <Q><HI>Bi∣shops</HI> alone were some hundred Years before the <HI>Reformation,</HI> invested with the Power of Ordina∣tion.</Q> But then the Question recurs, What were these <HI>Bishops?</HI> Were they by <HI>Divine Right superiour</HI> to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or not? If they were, let him prove it. If they were not, the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Ordination</HI> was <HI>all this while</HI> in the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> whether they exercised it or not. If these <HI>Bishops</HI> had the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Ordination</HI> themselves, the <HI>Presbyters</HI> ordained by them <HI>receiv∣ed
<PB N="125" REF="003651_0065_10023CA137FB6008"/>all</HI> the Authority <HI>appointed by Christ</HI> and <HI>his Apos∣tles,</HI> to those of their Order: and consequently had the Power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> according to the original Institution, <HI>inherent</HI> in them; by what <HI>Usurpation</HI> soever they were kept from the <HI>Exercise</HI> of it. Cer∣tain it is, that the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves, among whom was the <HI>Succession</HI> of Bishops he pleads for, did not pretend to the <HI>divine</HI> Right of Episcopacy; They supposed Bishop and Presbyter to be the <HI>same Order</HI> by original Right: and therefore their <HI>Presbyters</HI> were by their own Principles, ordained to all the Powers that belonged to <HI>Bishops</HI> This our Author himself reminds us of, <HI>p.</HI> 27. <Q>This very Argument (says he) do the Papists use, to prove the Sameness of Bishops and Presbyters, as to Order.</Q> Now then if Presbyters were of the same Order with Bishops, not only by Divine Institution, but even in the Opinion of their <HI>Ordainers,</HI> what will become of the Gentle∣man's Reasoning under this Proposition. And this was the Opinion of the <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> every where, at the Time of the <HI>Reformation:</HI> not only the foreign Churches, who carried on the <HI>Reformation</HI> without their <HI>Bishops;</HI> but even in <HI>England</HI> it self; as may be seen at large, in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to the first Volume of Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Reformation;</HI> and in the eighth Chapter of Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renicum. Among a Number of Questions proposed by the <HI>King,</HI> to be answered by some select Divines, this was one;</P>
<P>"Whether <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Priests</HI> were first, and if the <HI>Priests</HI> were first, then the <HI>Priest</HI> made the <HI>Bishop?</HI>—To which <HI>Arch-Bishop Cranmer</HI> made Answer,</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> were at one Time: and were not two Things; but both one Office, in the beginning of Christ's Religion.</Q> —And the <HI>Bishop</HI> of St. <HI>Asaph, Ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby, Redman,</HI> and <HI>Cox,</HI> were all of the same Opinion with the <HI>Arch-Bishop.</HI> And indeed, this was the constant sense of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in this Matter, for a long Time after the
<PB N="126" REF="003651_0066_10023CB25FF7AF70"/><HI>Reformation.</HI> The first Person, that ventured publickly to assert the <HI>divine</HI> Right of Episcopacy, was <HI>Dr. Bancroft,</HI> then Chaplain to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> in a Sermon at <HI>Paul's Cross,</HI> Jan. 12. 1588. He declared, that <Q>the <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>England</HI> were a distinct Order from <HI>Priests,</HI> and had Superiority over them <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> and directly from God.</Q> This made a great Noise, and gave great Offence to many of the Clergy. Sir <HI>Francis Knolles,</HI> Treasurer of the Queen's Houshold, had this much at Heart; and supposed, that <HI>if the Bishops were not under go∣vernours, to her Majesty, of the Clergy, but superiour Governours over their Brethren, by God's Ordinance; it will then follow, that her Majesty is not superiour Governours over her Clergy.</HI> He writ to the learned Dr. <HI>Raynolds</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> for his Opinion of <HI>Bancroft's</HI> Doctrine, who largely and learnedly refuted it. And <HI>Arch-Bishop Whitgift</HI> himself (notwithstanding his imperial and lordly Behaviour) said, He rather wished, than believed it to be true (<HI>Neal</HI>'s Hist of Purit <HI>p.</HI> 494.) Such an <HI>upstart</HI> Doctrine is the <HI>divine</HI> Right of <HI>Epis∣copacy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have distinctly considered all the Argu∣ments for <HI>Prelacy,</HI> advanced by this Author: and must leave it to your Judgment, whether it be not a full and sufficient Answer; and whether we have not Cause (notwithstanding <Q>the Inferences of a severe Aspect and harsh Sound,</Q> which this Gen∣tleman would draw from our <HI>Ordinations</HI>) to comfort our selves, with the Expectation of Christ's promised Presence with us, in the faithful Discharge of our Ministry; and of his Blessing upon his Ordinances by us administred.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was some time after the foregoing Piece was in the Printer's hand, that we were saluted with <HI>another Answer</HI> to the <HI>Dia∣logue</HI> between <HI>Prelaticus</HI> and <HI>Elutherius,</HI> bearing the Title of <HI>ELEUTHERIUS ENERVATUS</HI> &amp;c. Now indeed I can't b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be of Opinion, that impartial Judges will apprehend, that <HI>Eluthe∣rius</HI> in the preceeding <HI>Vindication</HI> has anticipated the greatest part of what is necessary to be offer'd in Defence of his Dialogue against this new Assault. However, that the Gentlemen concern'd therein, might not complain of any Neglect, nor have the Oppor∣tunity of glorying (as their manner is) "in a Book <HI>never answer'd,</HI>" a little Pains have been bestow'd in some Remarks on their Perfor∣mance, which are exhibited to the Publick in the following Pages.</P>
<P>It was thought convenient, that the Replications to both the Epis∣copal Answers should be publish'd under one Cover. But by reason of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Distance from the Press, we could not expect sea∣sonably to receive his Reply to this other Answer. Therefore T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e taken the Liberty to stand his <HI>Second</HI> in this Polemick Engage∣ment: tho' conscious, I've need to make an Apology for my Offici∣ousness, in appearing (unask'd) in the Defence of <HI>ONE,</HI> who needs no Assistant.</P>
<P>I hope, the Gentlemen I oppose, will not be offended at the Free∣dom and Warmth of Expression I've sometimes us'd; since it is but in <HI>Imitation</HI> of their own Language. I've in that Respect chosen to deal with them in <HI>their own</HI> Way, to the End they may more readily be convinc'd of the Abuses and Follies of <HI>their</HI> Way of handling the Controversy, and learn to set a better Example for the future. For if these <HI>Episcopal</HI> Advocates ever serve Religion, or their Cause, by the Method and Manner of Writing they've gone into, I shall be one among ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that evill be very greatly mistaken.</P>

<HEAD>PART I. Remarks on the <HI>Dialogue</HI> between <HI>Euseb.</HI> &amp; <HI>Eleuth.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Sect. I.</HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Compiler (shall I call him?) or the Publisher of this new Work, is pleas'd to subscribe himself by the specious Name of PHILALETHES, <HI>a Friend to Truth:</HI> and if that be his <HI>just</HI> Character, we may not be allow'd to doubt but that, when he feels the force of <HI>Truth,</HI> he will shew himself open to Conviction. Tho' if we should critically examine the <HI>hectoring Preface</HI> to his Performance, I fear whether there wou'd not be found some dark Omens of a <HI>contrary</HI> Complexion upon him, in several invidious Turns he has on the <HI>Editor</HI> of the Dialogue between <HI>Prelaticus</HI> and <HI>Elutherius,</HI> and in the <HI>secret History</HI> he gives us of the LAY∣MAN'S <HI>Letters</HI> to the suppos'd Rev. <HI>Author.</HI> They serve to give us a Specimen of his Veracity, and a Taste of his Kindness to his <HI>Quondam Friends.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman (<HI>pag.</HI> 4.) makes a mighty Stir about an innocent Passage of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s, that one woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a'tho't lay much out of his Way at present: and like a zealous Lover of Truth, very decently taxes him of <HI>a notorious Fals∣hood;</HI> appealing to the <HI>Layman's</HI> Letters for Evidence; which are to be consider'd in the Sequel. Observe in the mean time, <HI>Elutherius's</HI> Words are easily capable of being
<PB N="2" REF="003651_0068_10023CA4CABE07D0"/>reconcil'd to Truth, by an obvious Distinction. The Pas∣sage is in the 54th page of his <HI>Dialogue;</HI> <Q>I'm sure (says he) I have no Eyes, if the truly <HI>primitive Fathers</HI> are not all with one Voice in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Scheme. And I desire any of your Party to bring so much as one of them, that declares <HI>Episcopacy</HI> to be of <HI>Divine Right</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> supe∣riour to Presbytery; within the first three hundred Years after Christ. <HI>This Demand</HI> has been often repeated; but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answered.</HI></Q> Now the force of the Objection lies against these <HI>last Words:</HI> By which, no Person of Candour and Capacity cou'd understand him to mean any other than that this <HI>Demand</HI> was never answered <HI>really</HI> and <HI>satisfactorily;</HI> whatever has been attempted or <HI>"pretended in Answer to it."</HI> And, as it happen'd, <HI>Elutherius's</HI> Observation was back'd with the Judgment of two very learned <HI>Antiquaries,</HI> Di∣vines of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> whose Words this Gentle∣man here artfully passes over in Silence; doubtless that he might <HI>"bluster with the greater Assurance,"</HI> and cry out of <HI>" notorious Falshood</HI> and <HI>amazing Confidence"</HI> with the more Advantage. Verily I suspect this was <HI>"design'd for Amusing the Vulgar: "</HI> and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems as if he was resolv'd to begin, as well as <Q><HI>wind up, with Triumph, tho' at the Expence of his Integrity</HI></Q> and Modesty.</P>
<P>This Gentleman here brings in Mr. SAGE'S <HI>Vindication</HI> of the Principles <HI>of the Cyprian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck Age,</HI> as a wonderful Perform∣ance; which gives me a fair Occasion to refer the Rea∣der to the several <HI>Answers,</HI> made to that Author, by Mr. <HI>Jameson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lauder</HI> &amp;c, and I will take the Opportunity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>peat the just Censure passed on that Book, by an eminent Divine of the Episcopal Communion. <Q>It were not a diffi∣cult Task (says he) to shew, that there are in <HI>the Vindi∣cation of the Principles of the Cyprianick Age</HI> a great many FORCED and DISTORTED Quorations out of ancient and modern Authors, for Episcopacy in his Acception of it.</Q> Dr. EDWARDS; <HI>Remains,</HI> p. 275.</P>
<P>In the next place, I observe, <HI>Philalethes</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 5.) brings in Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> as a Champion for <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> To which it were Answer Enough, to say, if he has a <HI>Richard Hooker</HI> to boast of, we have a <HI>Thomas Hooker</HI> to match him. <HI>The Survey of Church Discipline,</HI> wears, for ought I see, as <HI>venerable</HI> a hoary Head, as the <HI>Ecclesiastical Polity.</HI> But what I wou'd especially remark is, That it appears to me a very <HI>odd</HI> point of conduct in this Gentleman to alledge his Episcopal HOOKER'S <HI>Ecclesi∣astical
<PB N="3" REF="003651_0068_10023CA4CABE07D0"/>Polity,</HI> and glory in it as a Book "<HI>above an hundred Years</HI> old, <HI>yet never answered;</HI>" when, if he has ever red it with any Care, he cou'd not but be sensible, that this his applauded Author never declares himself for the <HI>unalterable Divine Institution</HI> of any one particular Form of Church-Go∣vernment: but holds that all our Forms of Government are equally practicable; no one being of Divine Right, in that nature as to <HI>exclude</HI> another. I acknowledge him a Friend to Episcopacy: but far from being a Patron of <HI>this Gentleman</HI>'s Cause, the <HI>immutable Divine Right</HI> and indispensable <HI>Necessity</HI> of Prelacy, as a <HI>distinct Order</HI> superiour to Presbytery, and over a Plurality of Cities and Churches. Here's surely a stumble at the very Threshold. An unlucky Accident!—But that it mayn't be said I impose on the credulous Reader, I'll give him the sense of two Episcopal Divines upon the Politi∣cian: The one is Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> who says (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 394.) <Q>They who will please but to consult the <HI>third</HI> Book of learned and judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker's</HI> Ecclesiastical Polity, may see the MUTABILITY of the Form of Church Go∣vernment largely asserted, and <HI>fully proved.</HI></Q>—My other Witness is Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> whose words are (<HI>Remains,</HI> p. 257.) <Q>The judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> holds, that <HI>Episcopacy</HI> may be ABROGATED: and consequently is not of Divine and A∣postolical Right, but is the Political Institution of the Church.</Q>—Now, if these be the Principles, that Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> defends (as our Adversary says) <Q><HI>with such strength of Reason and clear Evidence, that nothing but Obstinacy can withstand;</HI></Q> I must have Leave very much to wonder what sort of Metal those Gentleman's Forheads are made of, that dare in Contradiction to their admired <HI>judicious</HI> HOOKER, assert <HI>Diocesan Prelacy</HI> as the <HI>invariable</HI> Form of Church Go∣vernment by <HI>Divine</HI> Institution. "<HI>On this Account</HI> (to allude to this Writer's own Remark) <Q><HI>it is justly thought, by some in∣genious Men, a needless Waste of Time and Labour, to give new Answers and Replies to such Objections, as have been so fully answered</HI></Q>— by Presbyterians, and so effectually su∣perseded even by that learned Episcoparian. <Q><HI>But yet for the Satisfaction of some, that may be stumbled, upon reading this doughty Performance</HI></Q> of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> it may be of Ser∣vice to bestow a few Remarks upon the principal Contents of the <HI>Dialogue</HI> he has fram'd between <HI>Eusebius</HI> &amp; <HI>Eleutherius.</HI></P>
<P>I pass over his Lady's merry Squibs; as also I shall several other Impertinencies, in the Course of his Conference, and confine my self chiefly to matter of Argument.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003651_0069_10023CA671BD8158"/>
<HI>Sect.</HI> II. Whether <HI>Elutherius's</HI> Inquiry, either into the Scrip∣tures or Antiquity, <Q><HI>has been too superficial, to find out any thing of Truth</HI></Q> in the present Controversy, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> insinu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (<HI>p.</HI> 8.) may safely be left to the Opinion of indifferent Judges, upon their Perusal of his VINDICATION. But I'm sure this Gentleman shows, that <HI>his</HI> Inquiry into Antiquity, as well as sacred History, has been very <HI>superficial,</HI> when he chal∣lenges us, to <Q><HI>shew that it is agreable to the Practice of any good Christians in the first and purest Age of the Church, is form Parties, and separate Communions &amp;c.</HI></Q> He seems is have forgot there was such a Text in the Bible, as that, Gal ii. 11,—14. And did he never read what Mr <HI>Chillingworth</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s observ'd, (<HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lig. Prot.</HI> p. 228.) <Q>Divers time it hath hap∣pened, as in the Case of <HI>Chrysostom</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> particular <HI>Men,</HI> and particular <HI>Churches,</HI> have upon an overvalued Difference, either renounced Communion <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tually,</HI> or one of them separated from the other; and yet both have continued Members of the Catholick Church.</Q> Or did he never meet with that Passage in Bp. <HI>Hall</HI> (Works <HI>p.</HI> 520.) <Q>Let the Malicious prattle what they will; with <HI>some of ours</HI> [i. e. our Sects] the Controversie is not about any solid <HI>Limbs</HI> of the Christian <HI>Faith,</HI> but only of the very <HI>Skin;</HI> with some <HI>others,</HI> not about the Skin, but the <HI>Garment</HI> rather; nor about the Garment itself neither, but of the very <HI>Hem.</HI>—Controversies, that will easily admit of a Reconciliation.— Our Differences [i. e. the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> among Protestants] are no greater, than were those of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> among the HOLY Fathers of the Church, whose Quarrels notwithstanding are not so odiously blazoned by Posterity. I let pass the private <HI>Scoldings</HI> of the Ancients, not without some unpleasing (I had almost said misbeseeming) Tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness I had rather set before your Eyes (for good Lucke sake) those <HI>publique</HI> Altercations of the <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> which afterward shut up in a blessed Concord. What Quarrels arose at the Council of <HI>Ephesus</HI> between <HI>Cyril</HI> of Alexandria, and <HI>John</HI> of Antioch? The <HI>Churches</HI> under both stuck not to counter-thunder <HI>Anathemaes</HI> one against another—The Flame of their Rage almost drew the Christian <HI>World</HI> to Parties.</Q> — Then follows an Account of a hot Quarrel between the Roman and the Eastern Churches, happily heal'd by <HI>Athanasius.</HI> Whereupon the pious Bishop cries out, <Q>Nei∣ther would it speed otherwise with us, if some <HI>Athanasius</HI> from Heaven would but joyn our Hands together. Oh if
<PB N="5" REF="003651_0069_10023CA671BD8158"/>once — a <HI>Synod</HI> were call'd (as general as might) where∣in both parts freely and modesty might lay forth their Opi∣nions, and — common Terms agreed upon —; how <HI>easily</HI> then, how <HI>happily</HI> might these grievous Stirs be quickly pacified?</Q>—This is a sufficient Reply to <HI>Eus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hius's De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d.</HI> And as for what he says in his warm <HI>Declamation</HI> a∣gainst <HI>"the despised Party of Presbyterians, for forming separate Communions"</HI> &amp;c. I answer, the Stone which he hurls, hap∣pens not to come out of <HI>David</HI>'s Sling, and will do little Exe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution upon us. 'Tis rather like the Stone that <HI>Achilles</HI> is said to have flung at a dead Skull, which rebounding, struck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot his own Eye.
<Q><L>— Rediit lapis ultor ab esse,</L>

The hard Invective recoils in <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s face.

I doubt not <HI>Elutherius</HI> will be able easily to vindicate the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Separate Communions here or any where. Let this Writer take the pains to read judi∣cious HOOKLR'S <HI>Ecclesiastical Polity</HI> now: I claim in my Turn to recommend it to him. And let him, if he pleases, read Bp. STILLINGFLEET'S <HI>Unreasonableness of Separation</HI> too (to say nothing of his <HI>Irenicum</HI>) another Book he gravely "<HI>re∣commends to our Perusal; which,</HI> he says (<HI>p.</HI> II.) <HI>has to his knowledge convinced more than one of our dissenting Teachers.</HI>" Well, however, I commend even this also back to himself,
<PB N="6" REF="003651_0070_10023CB4F5EC6D98"/>for a more critical and serious Perusal. And I venture to chal∣lenge him, upon the Principles of these his own applauded Authors, to vindicate his <HI>Episcopal Separation.</HI> Surely this Writer exposes the Partiality of his Judgment, or else shews a very small Attention to the Merits of the Controversy between him and us, strangely forgetting <HI>what Part</HI> of the World he's in, while he thus presses into his Service, in <HI>New England,</HI> at all Adventures, <HI>Books</HI> that were evidently calculated for quite a different Meridian. <HI>Ex Vipera Theriacam,</HI> is one re∣markable point of Physick: and it may be no less excellent a Method in Controversy to turn our Adversary's own Authors against himself; as the best Antidote, sure, that can be, against the Poison he diffuses. And I might presently prepare a suffici∣ent Potion, to make him heartily sick, and cure him of his Boasting. It's manifest, They are chiefly <HI>Topical</HI> Arguments, those learned Episcoparian Writers make Use of, against the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Separation in <HI>England;</HI> and are easily accommodable, to the Service of our Cause, against the New England <HI>Episcopal</HI> Separatists. The Foundation-Prin∣ciple with the <HI>Ecclesiastical Politician</HI> is that (<HI>p.</HI> 89, 90) <Q>The <HI>Necessity</HI> of Polity and Regiment in <HI>all Churches</HI> may be held, <HI>without</HI> holding ANY ONE certain Form to be <HI>necessary</HI> in them all:—Seeing the general Principles [and Rules of Scriptures] are such, as <HI>do not</HI> particularly pre∣scribe <HI>any one;</HI> but <HI>sundry</HI> may EQUALLY <HI>be consonant</HI> to the general Axiomes of the <HI>Scripture.</HI></Q>— And Dr. <HI>Stil∣lingfleet</HI> is in full Concurrence with him. This is the very Spirit and Soul of his <HI>Irenicum;</HI> and however the <HI>Doctor</HI> might afterwards appear to some to have alter'd his Judgment, yet in this main Point (as well as some others) I see n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that he <HI>cary'd</HI> at all from himself: nor does he seem willing it shou'd be tho't indeed he had <HI>in any Thing</HI> contradicted his <HI>Irenicum,</HI> in his later Writings. So much seems to me plainly imploy'd in those Words of his, speaking of himself in the 3d Person, (<HI>Pref.</HI> to Unreas. of <HI>Sep.</HI> Edit. 2. <HI>p.</HI> 72.) <Q>But after all this, WHEREIN is it that he hath thus contradicted himself? Is it in the point of <HI>Separation?</HI>—No.</Q> Then he tran∣scribes several Particulars out of his <HI>Irenicum,</HI> exactly quadrat∣ing with Mr <HI>Hooker's</HI> Judgment: and subjoyns this approving Clause; <Q>Allow but these three <HI>Conclusions,</HI> and defend the present Separation if you can.</Q>—Now the same say I with equal Assurance, unto the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Separatists in <HI>New England.</HI> And I will add in the Words of Dr. STILLING∣FLEET
<PB N="7" REF="003651_0070_10023CB4F5EC6D98"/>(<HI>Ubi supra,</HI> p. 77.) <Q>If a <HI>Council</HI> cou'd be called of all the <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> in <HI>Christendom,</HI> we shou'd not doubt of their Determination of the <HI>Unlawfulness</HI> of the <HI>present Separation,</HI></Q> i. e of Eusebius and Company. Upon the whole we see, these Gentlemen must certainly read Books with a very distorted Eye, who think it proper to recommend <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> to us in <HI>New England;</HI> as if they had made a Coat to fit their Moon in all her Changes, or con∣triv'd a Dial for them to serve all Meridians. And by the way, I can't help making the Reflection; how little the <HI>Ingenuity</HI> of these Gentlemen is to be depended on, with re∣gard to the <HI>Fathers;</HI> what poor Encouragement we have to take Things upon <HI>Trust</HI> from these Men with Relation to <HI>An∣tiquity:</HI> who will venture to vouch <HI>modern</HI> Authors at this random-rate; making them speak what they never thought or dreamt, and espouse a Cause, which by their Scheme of Principles it appears, must needs have been their Abhorence.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> III. In Return now to what our Reverend <HI>Eusebius</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers next (<HI>pag.</HI> 9, 10, and 11.) on the head of <HI>Separation</HI> still, all I need to do, is to execute the <HI>Lex Talionis</HI> upon him, and transcribe his own Words, with a little different Turn. Indeed I had done it; following his Train of Reasoning, and adopting much of his Language: which Kind of Answer I thought sufficient—<HI>ad hominem;</HI> and I found the Words run as smoothly from my Pen as his. But for Brevity I omit the whole; yet think fit to subjoyn this obvious Remark: It must needs look very <HI>simple</HI> in this Writer, and make him bear an <HI>odd Figure</HI> in Controversy, to use such a way of arguing against <HI>Elutherius,</HI> which how specious soever might readily be turn'd <HI>against himself,</HI> and that with greater Advantage! Since <HI>Elutherius</HI> never was a professed Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and so never made a formal Separation from it: whereas the Gentleman, <HI>Eusebius</HI> is suppos'd to personate, was once an ordain'd Presbyter in one of the <HI>New England</HI> Churches, and has in the most open and solemn manner vo∣luntarily renounc'd their Communion; which Conduct of his, how he will be able to clear from the Guilt of <HI>Schism,</HI> upon the Principles of his admir'd Authors, I must confess my self at a Loss. — I shall add here; Certainly it can't be thought but that impartial Men will allow Presbyterian Or∣dinations in <HI>New England</HI> to have as much <HI>Validity,</HI> as is al∣low'd to Ordinations in the <HI>Scottish,</HI> and <HI>foreign</HI> Churches of
<PB N="8" REF="003651_0071_10023C8C64DAE408"/>the Presbyterian Persuasion, who are <HI>without Bishops,</HI> both Name and Thing; and this, of <HI>Choice,</HI> not of <HI>Necessity.</HI> I think truly we stand upon <HI>equal</HI> Terms with them: and that <HI>we</HI> have as good Pretensions to the Charity of our Episcopal Brethren, as they. And if so, I now send this Writer to his beloved <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> to learn Charity and Prudence from their <HI>Example;</HI> who, I believe, he will never once find so rash as to contest the Validity of Presbyterian Ordinations in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or among the Protestants <HI>abroad.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> (p. 122.) having laid down this general Observation, That <Q>Matters of Ecclesiastical Polity, as being of a <HI>farre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Nature &amp; Quality [i. e. than Things necessary] are not so <HI>strictly</HI> and <HI>everlastingly</HI> commaunded in Scripture, but that — Much which it <HI>hath taught,</HI> may become <HI>unrequi∣site,</HI> sometime because we <HI>need not</HI> use it, sometimes also because we cannot: —he proceeds to say, 'In which res∣pect, for <HI>mine own</HI> part, altho' I see that certain <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> the SCOTTISH especially &amp; the FRENCH, have not that which <HI>best</HI> agreeth with the sacred Scripture, I mean the Government that is by <HI>Bishops,</HI> inasmuch as both those <HI>Churches</HI> are falne under a <HI>different</HI> kinde of Regiment, which to <HI>remedy,</HI> it is for the one <HI>altogether too late,</HI> and too <HI>soon</HI> for the other during their present Affliction, this their <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect</HI> I had rather lament in such Case, than <HI>exagitate,</HI></Q> that is, than raise a Dispute and Disturbance about it. Observe, the want of Bishops, he calls a <HI>Defect,</HI> and <HI>Imperfection;</HI> but does not make it an <HI>Essential</HI> Defect, a <HI>fundamental</HI> Imperfection, such as destroy'd the true Church-State, &amp; must by all means be supply'd or repair'd: No, says he, to <HI>remedy</HI> it, is ALTOGETHER TOO LATE for the one, and as much TOO SOON for the other. Now one of these, I doubt, is the true Case of <HI>New England</HI> at this Day: and I am in∣clin'd to think, Judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> would say, it is the <HI>former;</HI> and judging our <HI>Defect,</HI> in regard of Bishops, <HI>"an irreme∣diable Error,"</HI> would determine it best to <HI>lament</HI> in such Case, rather than <HI>exagitate,</HI> as is the manner of his pretended Followers and Admirers. But verily till they prove our Ec∣clesiastical Methods "contrary to the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI>" and "repugnant to the general Axioms of holy <HI>Scripture</HI>" (which they can never do) they can plead no Warrant from Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> to <HI>exagitate,</HI> contend, and oppose the settled Orders in these Churches. Neither do I think, they can fetch any Au∣thority or Countenance from <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s other celebrated <HI>Au∣thor.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="003651_0071_10023C8C64DAE408"/>For tho' I find Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> (in his <HI>Unreas.</HI> of <HI>Sep.</HI>) often mentioning <HI>New England,</HI> yet never once that I have observ'd, does he say any thing that has the Appearance of condemning our Ordinations as invalid, or our Churches as not true and good. —And now as for the <HI>Letters</HI> annexed to that Treatise of the Doctor's, wrote by famous <HI>Presbyterians</HI> abroad, which this <HI>Gentleman</HI> boasts of as <Q><HI>condemning the English Separatists,</HI></Q> let this (to omit all other Remarks) for the present be accepted as Fact; I however put it to his Con∣science, whether he thinks the <HI>Authors</HI> of those Letters meant to condemn the Churches in <HI>New England;</HI> or whether even the <HI>Principles</HI> there laid down, will in any manner reach this End. For my part I gladly appeal to those very <HI>Letters,</HI> for the Vindication of <HI>our</HI> Churches: and I dare this Writer to bring <HI>his</HI> late Separation from us upon a <HI>Trial</HI> by those Letters.</P>
<P>As to Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> let this Gentleman read his <HI>Discourse of Episcopacy;</HI> where he may inform himself of the Principle which retain'd that Excellent Divine in the Episcopal Commu∣nion: and he'll find the Doctor's <HI>Example</HI> of Charity and Moderation as well operates against <HI>him,</HI> for <HI>"falling in with the Separation"</HI> in New England, as his <HI>Arguments</HI> make for <HI>us,</HI> upon the head of Ministerial Parity; which are such, as this Writer I doubt will never be able to answer.</P>
<P>"<HI>The Opinion of the</HI> Old <HI>Nonconformists in our own Nation</HI>" is next bro't against us (<HI>p.</HI> 12) Upon which I need make no other Reply to our Author, but that I believe the World will think <HI>Eusebius</HI> had done well to have <HI>imitated</HI> the Example of those <Q><HI>old honest Nonconformist Ministers</HI> (as he calls 'em) <HI>in submitting to Lay-Communion, when he resign'd his Cure,</HI></Q> rather than to submit unto Reordination, and <Q><HI>run into the Errors of the Separatists.</HI></Q> If this sort of Reasoning has any force, it has as much in my Application of it, as in our Author's: Or if it be esteem'd Cant, and not Arguing, he has taught it me. But for a just Account of the Opinion and Practice of the Old Nonconformists, and a full Answer to the Argument bro't on this head, I refer to Dr. RULE'S <HI>Rational Defence,</HI> where <Q>the Case of the Separation is truly stated, and the Blame laid where it ought to be,</Q> in <HI>Answer</HI> to Dr. STILLINGFLEET'S <HI>Unreasonableness of Separation,</HI> which is there consider'd Paragraph by Paragraph, and intirely con∣futed.—However I wou'd subjoyn here one Observation; and this is, That if the old honest <HI>Nonconformist</HI> Ministers
<PB N="10" REF="003651_0072_10023C8FB00B1668"/>were against the <HI>Separation;</HI> just as much, I believe, were the old honest <HI>Conformist</HI> Puritans (which made the Body of the Clergy at first) against the unalterable <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> and absolute <HI>Necessity</HI> of the Hierarchy and Ceremonies of the Church of England.— <HI>Jam ergo sumus pares.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> IV. <HI>Eusebius</HI> proceeds to some Remarks on the <HI>Suffer∣ings</HI> of the <HI>Nonconformists.</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 13, 14, 15.) And for an An∣swer, I might commend him to <HI>Elutherius's</HI> VINDICATION; where he may find both History and Argument upon this head, Enough, I hope, to silence his Exclamations for the future.</P>
<P>Though, I can't but express my Admiration, that this <HI>Gen∣tleman</HI> should <HI>"have the face"</HI> to say that he <HI>"might insist on the Guilt of the Sufferers, and the Justice of the Government;"</HI> and to insinuate as if we were for <HI>"making Saints of Malefac∣tors;"</HI> and to talk of <Q><HI>the Event's proving since, what the Government then saw of the Tendency of Nonconforming Practices</HI></Q> &amp;c. This (by the Connection) appears de∣sign'd for a Slur on the way of the old nonconformable Puritans, or <HI>first Dissenters;</HI> whose Memory this <HI>Gentleman</HI> just now express'd some Respect for, by calling them <Q><HI>the old</HI> HONEST <HI>Nonconformist Ministers.</HI></Q> But, if in this he has spoken otherwise than he thought, and intended <Q><HI>no∣thing but Palaver and Complement</HI></Q> to serve a present Turn, I shall not however say to him, as he to <HI>Elutherius</HI> in another Case (<HI>p.</HI> 17.) <HI>"Pray retract it: "</HI> No, but I patiently let him stand condemn'd out of his own Mouth, guilty of a pal∣pable Self-Contradiction.— And as for his Reflections on the Sufferers <HI>after the Restoration,</HI> which are so full of Calumny and Abuse; what other Answer do they deserve, but that, <HI>Increpet te Dominus!</HI></P>
<P>He has rak'd together all the Instances of Wickedness, he cou'd easily think of: But <HI>who</HI> must pass for the Cri∣minals! Was it indeed the <HI>nonconforming Practices, that brought the Nation into the Confusion,</HI> he speaks of, <HI>with the Subversion of all Government civil and ecclesiastical!</HI> No; it was Tyranny in the State, and Persecution in the Church, that drove Things to those Extremities. <HI>The Event</HI> serves but to <HI>prove</HI> the Mis∣chief of Impositions, and the destructive Tendency of Episcopal Bigotry and Rigour, and arbitrary Government. The inglo∣rious Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the First is now sufficiently unveil∣ed; they were <HI>his</HI> arbitrary and illegal <HI>Practices,</HI> that bro't on the lamentable Series of Events, refer'd to: and the

We are told by Mr. <HI>Bennet</HI> (Historical Account &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 39. <Q>This is to be observ'd, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Cathe∣dralists</HI> had made themselves so <HI>obnoxious to the Parliament and the People,</HI> by <HI>their Affectation of Dominion over their Consciences in the last Convocation;</HI> and by the <HI>manifest In∣crease of Superstition, and encouragement of Superconformity, and a verging towards Popery,</HI> under the Direction of Arch Bp. <HI>Laud:</HI> that they cou'd not stand their Ground, even in a Parliament where there was scarce a Man but who was in full Communion with the Establish'd Church; and all this <HI>above a Year</HI> before the <HI>War</HI> was attempted, and before there was any such thing as a <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI> Church in <HI>England:</HI> And <HI>those</HI> who the year after <HI>manag'd the War, and headed the Armies upon the Account of Liberty, against the tyrannical Incroachment of the King and his Ministers, were Members of the</HI> Establish'd <HI>Church; as those were, who made the</HI> like <HI>noble Stand at the</HI> REVOLUTION.</Q> Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> tells us, <Q>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> was dis∣satisfy'd with the Courses some of the <HI>Bishops</HI> had follow'd, <HI>before</HI> the Troubles began; and cou'd not but impute their <HI>first Rise</HI> to the Provocations that had been given by them.

Further, WHO were those men that were so <HI>great Incendiaries in the troublesome Times, and dur∣ing the Usurpation promoted the Persecution of the poor Remains of the Royal and Church Party?</HI> Does he point to those <HI>Episcopal</HI> Clergymen, that actually bore Arms in the King's Service against the Parliament, and were (as Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> says) fa∣mous for fighting and plundering the Country! or those that (as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> observes) cou'd not forbear printing and preach∣ing Satyrs on the Times, and provoking the Government to Severity!—And when he speaks of some who <HI>solemnly swore to the League and Covenant, which horrid Impiety</HI> (he says) <HI>was truly the Cause of their after-Misery;</HI> Does he allude to those blessed Times (3 or 4 Years before the Civil War) when Arch bishop <HI>Laud</HI> was busy in <HI>swearing</HI> Clergy and Lai∣ty to <HI>Canonical</HI> Obedience and Superconformity, by the famous <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at ra-Oath:</HI> the End of which was to support the Hi∣erarchy, Engaging all Persons in a Vow <HI>never to alter it;</HI> and the imposing of which gave such a general Alarm and Disgust to the Nation?

But it may be I have been <HI>out,</HI> in every one of my Constructions; and the <HI>Gentleman</HI> was all this while levelling at the poor <HI>Dissenters.</HI> Be it so! We are then to understand him as speaking of the Dissenters, when he tells us (p. 15.) "<HI>All of them had the offer of keeping their Livings, tho' they were stolen, on Condition they would swear Fidelity to the King, and Obedience to the Laws, and under Oath</HI> renounce the <HI>impious League and Covenant.</HI>"— Merciful Dispensation, to suffer the continuance of those Quondam-Rebels, even <HI>all of</HI> them, in <HI>stoln</HI> Livings; and this, when <HI>they had too long</HI> already <HI>kept the right Owners out,</HI> and upon such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy Conditions!</HI> And if these were <HI>all</HI> the Conditions offer'd 'em, it's more merciful still, &amp; truly very wonderful, that none of those, who had been <HI>irregular Intruders,</HI> shou'd be requir'd to submit to <HI>Reordination,</HI> by Episcopal Hands!

We may justly claim as much Liberty and Privilege certainly as any <HI>Provincial</HI> Churches: and our Ad∣versaries concede, that the Power of all Provinces is equal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Orig, Draught,</HI> p. 151, 2.</NOTE>. As a Consequence of which, it must be granted, where some general Council or national Synod has not interpos'd its Au∣thority, every Provincial Church is left to regulate their own Affairs according to their best Prudence, without any Obli∣gation to Uniformity with other Churches in all Ceremonies. As judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> observes (<HI>Eccl. Pol.</HI> p. 160.) <Q>Churches are rather in this Case like <HI>divers Families,</HI> than like divers <HI>Servants</HI> of one Family; because <HI>every Church,</HI> the state whereof is <HI>independent</HI> [i. e. as a Church] upon any other [Church] hath Authoritie to appoint Orders <HI>for it self</HI> in Things indifferent,</Q> or variable; among which he con∣stantly reckons the Form of Church-Government. Dr. <HI>Still∣ingfleet</HI> allows of <Q>the Separation or distinct Communion of <HI>whole Churches</HI> from each other.</Q> And he tells us (<HI>Misch.</HI> of <HI>Sep.</HI> p. 16—19.) <Q>The true Notion of a <HI>Church</HI> is no more than of <HI>a Society of Men united together for their Order and Government according to the Rules of the Christian Religion.</HI>— Every Church thus Constituted (says he) we do assert to have a just Right of governing <HI>it self,</HI> and of reforming Errors in Doctrine and Corruptions in Worship. On which Ground, we are acquitted from the Imputation of <HI>Schism,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="003651_0075_10023C7100A35C50"/>in the Separation from the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; for we only resume our just Rights.</Q>—Now the same say I in Defence of <HI>New England,</HI> with regard to our Variation from the E∣piscopal Church. And whereas Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> (Unreas. of <HI>Sep.</HI> p. 147, 8.) distinguishes and says, <Q>By <HI>Separation</HI> I do not understand a meer Difference as to the way of Worship, which the Members of the <HI>foreign</HI> Churches are <HI>here</HI> per∣mitted to enjoy: For <HI>they</HI> do not <HI>break off</HI> from the <HI>Com∣munion</HI> of <HI>our</HI> Churches;—They never departed from ours, but only <HI>continue</HI> in the Communion of <HI>their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Churches:</Q> The like I say in behalf of the Body of the People in <HI>New England;</HI> They don't <HI>break off from the Communion of the</HI> Episcopal <HI>Church,</HI> but <HI>only continue in the Communion of</HI> their own <HI>Churches.</HI> We are therefore, by the avow'd Principles of this great Champion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Cause, acquitted from the Guilt of <HI>Schism,</HI> yea of <HI>Se∣paration.</HI> <Q>For (as he argue, <HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 156.) a Man is not said to <HI>separate</HI> from <HI>every</HI> Church, where he <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bears</HI> or <HI>ceases</HI> to have Communion; but only from <HI>that</HI> Church, with which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>oblig'd</HI> to hold Communion [being a <HI>Member</HI> of it] and yet withdraws from it.</Q>—This now shows at <HI>whose</HI> Door, according to him, the Charge of <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Se∣paration</HI> must lie, whether <HI>ours,</HI> or our <HI>Episcopal</HI> Brethren's. And if these new Separatists have such a Value for this Doc∣tor's Judgment, let them hear how he concludes upon the Matter (<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 240, 1.) <Q>I cannot yet see, by all that hath been said, how those that break the <HI>established Order</HI> in a <HI>Church,</HI> wherein all the <HI>Substantials of Religion</HI> are acknow∣ledged to be <HI>sound,</HI> and set up particular independent <HI>Churches</HI> in <HI>Opposition</HI> to it, can acquit themselves from the Guilt of SCHISM, how great and intolerable soever it be thought.</Q> — Now it's most evident from the whole Tenour of the Doctor's Writings, that notwithstanding our particular way of Worship and Form of Church-Government, he holds us in the Roll of the Churches of God, which have all the <HI>Substantials</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> in them. He often speaks of the <HI>New England Churches;</HI> and his <HI>Definition</HI> of a Church belongs to ours. And the <HI>Arguments</HI> he makes use of against Separation, are equally applicable by us against our Epis∣copal Separatists. Sure I am, the <HI>Unreasonableness of Separati∣on</HI> falls heavily upon these <HI>New England</HI> Dissenters. For I'm confident, they can't object to us either of those Things, which the Doctor says may be the just Reasons of a <HI>Separation,</HI> viz.
<PB N="17" REF="003651_0075_10023C7100A35C50"/><Q><HI>heinous Error</HI> in Doctrine, or <HI>idolatrous</HI> Practice in Wor∣ship, or <HI>Tyranny</HI> over the Consciences of Men; which yet he observes (<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 221.) may not be such as to destroy <HI>true Baptism,</HI> and therefore consistent with the <HI>Essentials</HI> of a <HI>Church.</HI></Q> We are then <HI>true Churches,</HI> according to him: and <HI>pure</HI> Churches too; free from the <HI>Causes of</HI> a justifiable Separation. I may with the highest Justice now give our separating Brethren the <HI>Doctor's</HI> Words (<HI>Ibid</HI> p. 217, 8.) <Q>There can be no way left to justify the <HI>Separation</HI> from our Church, but to prove, either that our <HI>Worship</HI> is <HI>idolatrous,</HI> or that our <HI>Doctrine</HI> is <HI>false,</HI> or that our <HI>Ceremonies</HI> are made <HI>necessary</HI> to <HI>Salvation:</HI> which are all so remote from any Colour of <HI>Truth,</HI> that none of our Adversaries have yet had the <HI>Hardiness</HI> to undertake it. —And I earnestly desire our <HI>Brethren,</HI> as they love their own Souls, and wou'd avoid the Guilt of so great a Sin, impartially and without Prejudice to consider that Passage of <HI>Irenaeus</HI> (quoted by the <HI>Dr.</HI> Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 212, 3.) and how <HI>parallel</HI> it is with their own Case who <HI>separate</HI> from us, and set up other Churches in <HI>Opposition</HI> to ours, which yet they acknowledge to be very <HI>orthodox,</HI> and to agree with them in the <HI>same Doctrine</HI> and the <HI>same Sacraments.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I might indeed address <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his <HI>own</HI> Language (p. 17.) <Q><HI>After so much plainly confessed, of the safety of our Communion, pray justify your self in leaving it, and using so much Pains to asperse a good and excellent Church,</HI></Q>—and so on to the end of the Paragraph. It is remarkable how <HI>unlucky</HI> this Gentle∣man is continually in the Choice of his Arguments, as well as Authors; which do but serve in the End to hit himself, and lash his own Error. And all the Revenge I care at present to take upon him for his <HI>hard Speeches,</HI> in the Close of that Paragraph, is this, <HI>Medice! cura te ipsum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VI. Now for the <HI>Presbyterian Objections,</HI> relating to Oaths, Subscriptions, Licences &amp;c. if (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> informs us, <HI>p.</HI> 18.) <Q>they have been <HI>solidly answered, especially by Mr.</HI> Hooker <HI>and Bp.</HI> Hoadley,</Q> I have this to remark upon it, that those Objections have been as solidly <HI>supported</HI> and de∣fended by Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mod, Nonconf.</HI> in 3 Vol. against <HI>Ollyffe</HI> and <HI>Hoadly.</HI></NOTE>, and others; who have also largely set forth the Objections that <HI>"affect Lay Communion."</HI></P>
<P>And now since this <HI>Gentleman</HI> has call'd in a new Advocate
<PB N="18" REF="003651_0076_10023C54D66B3648"/>for his Cause, Bp. <HI>Hoadly;</HI> I take Leave to put him upon trying how he can justify the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Separation in New Eng∣land, by <HI>that Author</HI>'s Principles, as exhibited in his Writ∣ings, even in his Controversy with Dr. <HI>Calamy.</HI></P>
<P>I pass over <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s mean Reflections on <HI>Elutherius</HI> (p. 19.) which serve only to give us? Picture of himself, and to point out "<HI>the Cause of his</HI> own <HI>Misfortune." Mutato Nomine de se Fabula narratur.</HI> Sure he had now forgot the Admonition given him but a little before (<HI>p.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.) <Q>Attalus <HI>told</HI> Eusebius, <HI>these Invectives carry nothing of Argument, and it were better to return to the Purpose.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon what he offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s next (<HI>p.</HI> 20, 21.) all I have Occasion to do, is again to <HI>retort,</HI> and put him to solve his own Diffi∣culties. This Gentleman's <Q><HI>own Confessions, which I have already remark'd, shew that he himself does not think</HI> but that there may be HONEST <HI>Nonconformist Ministers: and if he might have remain'd</HI> an HONEST Nonconformist Mini∣ster, or <HI>a good Christian in the Communion of our Churches, what cou'd constrain him to</HI> desert <HI>it?</HI></Q>—The Point of <HI>Subjection</HI> to Ecclesiastical Laws, I leave him to dispute with <HI>Elutherius,</HI> who sufficiently answers what he has here suggested on that head. VINDIC. p. 41, 45.— I might go on in our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Language (tho' it grates me, to repeat after him the Words of <HI>Crimination;</HI> I do it not in a way of Charge, but only to let him see how he likes his own opprobrious Language at <HI>second hand</HI>) and might say to him, as he to <HI>Elutherius;</HI>—<Q><HI>Since you were required to give Adoration to none but the true God</HI>—&amp;c. <HI>what cou'd make you uneasy and discontented, but your own</HI> EVIL, RESTLESS, AMBITIOUS <HI>Spirit? The Constitution of our Church has been sufficiently justify'd by Men of greater Sense and Abilities than you or I, and 'tis enough to refer you to those ingenious and learned Treatises</HI></Q>— But I'm e'en sick of transcribing such insipid and nauseous Stuff.</P>
<P>I will now relieve the Reader, and my self, with an enter∣taining and apposite Passage out of pious Bp. <HI>Hall</HI>'s Works (<HI>p.</HI> 516, 7.) <Q>It is an heavy Crime (says he) wherewith we are charged by the Romanists, That we are <HI>fallen off from the Catholick Church,</HI> that we have <HI>rent the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emless Coat of Christ;</HI> — whereof if we were indeed guilty, how unwor∣thy were we to <HI>breath</HI> in this Air? But we call Heaven and Earth to Record, how unjustly this Calumny is cast upon us, yea, we protest before God and Men, that the Envy of this
<PB N="19" REF="003651_0076_10023C54D66B3648"/>so foul a <HI>Crimination</HI> lights most justly upon the Heads of the <HI>Accusers.</HI> May it please you to hear a short <HI>Apologue:</HI> A certain Man invited to a <HI>Feast</HI> one or two of his Friends; entertained them bountifully; They sat together lovingly, they are together, and were merry one with another: In the <HI>second Course</HI> (as the Custome is) the Master offereth them <HI>Wine,</HI> sets before them an <HI>Apple;</HI> now a <HI>Worme</HI> had somewhat eaten the Apple, and a <HI>Spider</HI> by Chance had fallen into the Cup; <HI>The</HI> GUEST <HI>sees and balks it:</HI> The MASTER urgeth him, Why do you not eat, quoth he, why drink you not? <HI>I dare not, saith the</HI> OTHER, <HI>'tis not safe to do either; seest thou not this Vermine in the Cup, and that in the Apple?</HI> Tush, saith the MASTER, what so great matter is this? It was I, that set this before thee; it was I, that began to thee in the other; Drink it, eat it, at least for my sake. <HI>But, suffer me first</HI> (<HI>replies the</HI> GUEST) <HI>to take out this Spider, to cut out this Worme; the Wine, the Apple likes me well enough; the Spider, the Worme, I cannot away with.</HI> AWAY with such overnice and curious Com∣panions (quoth HE againe) FY upon thee, thou ungrate∣ful Fellow, that dost so little regard my Friendship, so contemn my Cheere: And with that, <HI>in a Rage,</HI> throws the Platters and Pots in the very Face of his Guest, and <HI>thrusts him out of doors all wounded.</HI> Tell me now, I beseech you, worthy Auditors, <HI>whether</HI> of these <HI>violates</HI> the Laws of Hospitality? I dare say you have easily <HI>applied</HI> it before me.—We have willingly departed from the Communion of their <HI>Errors;</HI> from the Communion of the <HI>Church</HI> we have <HI>not</HI> departed. Let <HI>them</HI> but cast away [the <HI>Spider</HI> in the Cup, the <HI>Worme</HI> in the Apple; what else be they, but <HI>Superstition</HI> in their Worship, rotten and un∣wholesome <HI>Traditions—? with out these,</HI> the Religion pleaseth us well: let them not thrust upon us] their <HI>Soul-slaying Traditions,</HI> we will communicate with them in the Right of <HI>one and the same Church,</HI> and remaine so <HI>for ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I think now the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s instructive Apologue tallies very well with <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s diverting Fable of the <HI>Blood-Pudding</HI> (VINDIC. p. 43.) and serves to give Countenance to it; how∣ever ludicrous an Aspect it may have in so serious an Argu∣ment. The <HI>Moral</HI> of both is the same, and the Application easy. This now is sufficient to justify the Nonconformists against <HI>"all malepert Opposers."</HI> And what was <HI>before</HI> offer'd <Q><HI>is full Enough,</HI> Eusebius (I give you back your own Words, <HI>p</HI> 21.)
<PB N="20" REF="003651_0077_10023C5E03397080"/><HI>to shew that you was no ways constrain'd by the force of rati∣onal Arguments, as you pretend, to leave the Communion of the Church,</HI> in which you were once a Pastor, <HI>and joyn with Dissenters: which is as much as I have undertaken, in order to refute the whole Argument of your Dialogue.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VII. A short Interlude happens next. The Debate between <HI>Eusebius</HI> and <HI>Elutherius</HI> being now interrupted, we have <HI>Philalethes</HI> taking a Turn in the controversial Conversa∣tion (<HI>p.</HI> 22, 23.) But I must beg this Gentleman's Pardon, if I observe, his Head seems, like <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s, to have grown <HI>giddy,</HI> upon their Voyage for Episcopal Orders: <HI>which</HI> makes him stumble too on plain Ground; he also forgets what Part of the World he's now in, and that all Arguments don't alike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute every Climate.</P>
<P>We'll for once allow him his Plea, <Q><HI>That the Church of Christ has Power to make Orders and Rules, for Regulating its Discipline, and prescribing how her Clergy shall be admitted</HI> &amp;c.</Q> But what's this to the present Purpose? Or what Advantage will he get by it? I beg this <HI>Gentleman</HI> to inform me, <HI>what</HI> Church of Christ it is, that has interpos'd her Authority to make <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> for us in <HI>New England.</HI> He well knows, that the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> is limited, and do's not extend to the <HI>Plantations:</HI> So that we lie <HI>without</HI> the Pale of the <HI>establish'd</HI> national Church. He well knows also, that in several of these Charter-Government, the Civil Powers have given their highest Countenance, by reasonable Laws and Orders, to the Ministry and Discipline of the <HI>New England</HI> Churches: and have not our Province-Laws receiv'd the <HI>Royal</HI> Sanction! If there be any thing then in <HI>his Plea,</HI> that affects the Controversy before us, it will turn out in <HI>our</HI> favour: and he must be oblig'd to relinquish the Pretence. I may borrow some of the Words of Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> and apply them to the Occasion: <Q>This Argument therefore must be quitted; and they who will defend the <HI>present Se∣paration,</HI> must return to the <HI>old Principles</HI> of the <HI>Separatists,</HI> if they will justifie their own <HI>Practices.</HI> And so I find Mr. <HI>Philalethes</HI> is forced to do: for discerning that the Pretence of" Church-Power and Establishments "wou'd not hold of it self, he adds more Weight to it,</Q> and calls in the Help of <HI>Jus Divinum,</HI> which <Q>comes home to the Business, and brings us to the old Point of defending the <HI>Calling of our Ministry.</HI></Q> [Unreas. of <HI>Sep.</HI> p. 118.] — The
<PB N="21" REF="003651_0077_10023C5E03397080"/>Gentleman takes Sanctuary in his <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> the sole Refuge left him: And "<HI>a Couple of</HI> LETTERS <HI>written by a dear Friend of</HI>" Philalethes, which he <HI>"seems to be much charm'd with,"</HI> are here <HI>"held out,"</HI> and applauded, as containing Wonders, even <Q><HI>clear Proofs that the original Government of the Church was Episcopal,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (p. 23.) I shall reserve the Conside∣ration of <HI>them</HI> to their proper Place: and must now attend to the <HI>Conference</HI> between <HI>Eusebius</HI> and <HI>Elutherius,</HI> which revives afresh, and proceeds a little further upon the Business in hand.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VIII. Here (p. 24.) we find <HI>Eusebius</HI> undertaking to <Q><HI>examine the most weighty Arguments of</HI> Elutherius in his Dia∣logue, <HI>against the Episcopal Constitution, and in Justification of of the Presbyterian Scheme.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The first Argument he pitches on, is what <HI>Elutherius</HI> occa∣sionally suggested (<HI>Dial.</HI> p. 5.) That <Q><HI>a Prelate at best is but a human Creature, and not of Christ's Appointing.</HI></Q> This indeed was design'd more immediately against the <HI>Lordship</HI> and Jurisdiction of the Bishops. But <HI>Eusebius</HI> (p. 26.) says <Q><HI>Tis certain it was design'd for a Slur upon Episcopal</HI> ORDINATION;</Q> and makes a mighty Improvement of the harmless Passage, insinuating, as if <HI>Elutherius</HI> intended to argue, that <Q><HI>a Bishop or Prelate can have no Power to</HI> Ordain; <HI>because being a mere</HI> humane <HI>Creature himself, he can't make a</HI> Divine <HI>one,</HI> i. e. <HI>a Minister of Jesus Christ.</HI> Upon which he exclaims, <HI>If</HI> Eleu∣therius <HI>strikes thus high, he will</HI> UNDO <HI>us all,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Now in Answer to these Remarks, I'll attempt two Things—</P>
<P N="1">1. To point out several <HI>Senses,</HI> in which <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Propo∣sition may be safely understood, and in which it must be ac∣knowledg'd to be <HI>true.</HI></P>
<P>Here let it be observ'd, the Prelate spoken of is of the <HI>English</HI> Stamp, a <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishop; and now I say, <HI>this</HI> Prelate at best is but a human Creature, as deriving his whole Power from <HI>human</HI> Constitutions, having no external Jurisdiction but what he derives from the <HI>State,</HI> &amp; dependent upon the <HI>Crown</HI> for his very Being. The Apostle says, <HI>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World:</HI> So I may say of Prelacy, <HI>We know</HI> it <HI>is nothing in the World,</HI> in point of Divine Right. Just as our Author (I hope) would say of the Romish <HI>Papacy,</HI> it is at best a mere human Creature; so say we of English <HI>Prelacy:</HI> which is ma∣nifestly founded upon, and directed and limited by the Laws of the Nation. Some of the best Defenders of Episcopacy have
<PB N="22" REF="003651_0078_10023C609C9F7038"/>acknowledg'd, there's no such Thing as a strictly <HI>Diocesan</HI> Pre∣late to be found in <HI>Scripture:</HI> and if this Prelatical Power be not from the Laws of God, it must derive from the Civil Magistrate and Laws of the State. <Q>And indeed what is it (as one observes) that the Civil Magistrate may not do in the making of a Prelate in the Church of <HI>England?</HI> He may <HI>elect</HI> the Person, and does so in Reality; for he nominates authoritatively. He may <HI>multiply</HI> Bishops <HI>ad libitum;</HI> and if he pleases, may appoint one in every Parish. He may also <HI>delegate</HI> the Ecclesiastical <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> to whom he pleases: for the <HI>Lay-Chancellors,</HI> who judicially excom∣municate or absolve, have their Commission to do it from the <HI>King,</HI> not from the Bishop; and in some places the E∣piscopal Jurisdiction is reserved to a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> as in the <HI>Peculiars,</HI> they have in divers Parts of <HI>England:</HI> A certain Proof, that the Bishop's Jurisdiction is only by human Right. Lastly, the Civil Magistrate may also <HI>depose</HI> and deprive Bishops, when they see just Cause: and this Power has been so lately exerted, that it needs no further Proof. I would fain know whether the <HI>deprived Bishops</HI> were not divested of <HI>all</HI> Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. That which induces me to mention this is, I find the Defenders of the Hierarchy confidently assert, that <HI>there can be but one Bishop</HI> in one Church at the same time: therefore if the former were <HI>not divested of their Power,</HI> I see not how the succeeding Incumbents <HI>could have any</HI> by their own Rule; and so <HI>their Ordinations</HI> would be <HI>null,</HI> if the <HI>others</HI> be <HI>valid.</HI> To say, that the depriv'd Prelates had the <HI>Power</HI> still, but were re∣strained from the Exercise of it, would be to confront the Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> [in the Case of the Bishops depos'd at the Revolution] which says expresly, they are deprived of <HI>their Office,</HI> and distinguishes betwixt being <HI>suspended</HI> from the <HI>Exercise</HI> of their Office, and being <HI>deprived</HI> of the <HI>Office</HI> it self.—Upon the whole matter I think it is clear enough, that the English Prelacy is a <HI>meer Creature</HI> of the <HI>Civil Ma∣gistrate,</HI> who may make every <HI>Parson</HI> of a Parish a <HI>Bishop,</HI> if he pleases; their whole Power (as distinct from Presbyters) being founded upon the Laws of the Land.</Q> — Thus the learned Mr. <HI>Tong,</HI> in his ingenious Defence of Mr. <HI>H's En∣quiry</HI> (p. 53, to 60.) where this grand Point is largely argu'd, and Objections answer'd.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will tend more to <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Conviction, if I produce one of his <HI>own Authors.</HI> This therefore I will do,
<PB N="23" REF="003651_0078_10023C609C9F7038"/>and I pitch upon Bp. <HI>Hoadly;</HI> who in his elaborate. Argu∣ment on the Case of the <HI>depriv'd Bishops,</HI> upon the glorious Revolution (see Bp. of <HI>Bang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI>'s PRESERVATIVE, p. 9. &amp;c. p. 33, &amp;c.) furnishes us with a fair Key (very nigh the same with that of Mr. <HI>Tong</HI>) to that mystical Passage of <HI>Elutherius.</HI> He has learnedly demonstrated, that the Bishops <HI>Right</HI> of executing their Office ariseth from an <HI>human</HI> Original, i. e. the <HI>Nomination</HI> of the Civil Magistrate. <Q>This Nomination (says he) is vested in the <HI>Crown</HI> by the <HI>Laws:</HI> and is ultimately resolv'd into the supreme Authority of the <HI>Nation:</HI> Consequently, therefore, what is <HI>given,</HI> may be <HI>taken away,</HI> by the <HI>same Authority</HI> &amp;c." And it's remarkable "The words of the <HI>Act</HI> (says he) declare them [i. e. the <HI>Bishops</HI> deprived] to be <HI>depriv'd</HI> from their OFFICES, as well as their Dignities" &amp;c.— And therefore it was "A <HI>total</HI> Deprivation, and made them <HI>cease to be Bishops,</HI> as to any RIGHT (properly so called) of executing their Offices.</Q> Now my Remark upon it is, That this plainly argues an <HI>English Prelate</HI> in Effect to be (in <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s terrible Lan∣guage) <HI>at best but a human Creature;</HI> It shows, that Prelacy is in the Eye of the Civil Magistrate, and in Fact and Practice, but an accidental human Creation only. This is a Conclusion, that seems to me to follow from the Premises, as naturally and clearly as Light from the Sun. However at least it ap∣pears evident "beyond the Possibility of a Reply"(to use a High Church Phrase) that an English Prelate at the <HI>worst,</HI> that is, a <HI>depriv'd Bishop,</HI> is even at the best but a human Crea∣ture; unable, if he has any <HI>latent</HI> Power, to put it in Ex∣ercise, or perform any regular and (and in the Eye of the Law) valid Act of Authority, in point of Ordination or Jurisdiction. And <HI>if so,</HI> I fear me, this STRIKES HIGH indeed, and casts an odious Reflection somewhere, even upon <HI>Ordi∣nations.</HI> Now let <HI>Eusebius</HI> turn the Fury of his severe Resent∣ments from <HI>Elutherius,</HI> and fall foul on his own Advocate the Bishop, for "<HI>designing to cast a</HI> SLUR <HI>upon Ordinations,</HI> upon <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordinations" too (which it verily seems he has done in fact) and that the blackest of Slurs, upon some of 'em; even "the infamous Blot of <HI>Usurpation</HI> without a true Right."</P>
<P>But further I will lay before <HI>Eusebius</HI> one Consideration, that may serve as an <HI>Argumentum ad hominem,</HI> upon the Point we have in hand. I conclude, this Gentleman himself will confess, that an English <HI>Prelate</HI> is at best but a mere <HI>human Creature,</HI> if it can be prov'd he has no authentick <HI>Episcopal
<PB N="24" REF="003651_0079_10023C574D55D568"/>Consecration;</HI> which it will appear, upon <HI>his</HI> Principles, no Bishop in <HI>England</HI> at this day has a just Claim to, if it can be made out, that there has been a <HI>Breach</HI> of regular <HI>Suc∣cession</HI> at any time, evident and notorious. Now that there was in fact such a <HI>Breach,</HI> even at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> I vouch in an <HI>Episcopal Author</HI> for my Witness; whose Authority, Argument and Advice may have some Weight with this Gentleman. See a LETTER <HI>to the Rev.</HI> Mr. PEERS, <HI>Vicar of</HI> Faringdon, <HI>By a</HI> CLERGYMAN (<HI>London,</HI> printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1716.) Of which one informs us, "It deservedly met with good Acceptance from the World." There you will find the fol∣lowing Paragraphs. (<HI>p.</HI> 43. and onwards.) <Q>We have been taught, I know, to assert the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordina∣tion, in a <HI>Succession</HI> from the Apostles: but if that is to be done at all, it shou'd be done with <HI>Caution,</HI> even in our Sermons, but never in Print, because that <HI>Succession</HI> must be deriv'd thro' the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, which has been divided into great <HI>Schisms,</HI> and at last was so <HI>corrupted,</HI> so chang'd from the Model of Christ and his Apostles, that we were forc'd to <HI>separate</HI> from her. And when we did so, <HI>how</HI> was the <HI>Succession</HI> preserv'd!— Perhaps you have not read this Part of our History, and therefore I'll set down a Passage or two from Bp. BURNET'S <HI>History of the Reformation,</HI> with my own Observations, which you may peruse at your Leasure.</Q> I shall for Brevity leave out the historical Passages he quotes at large, yet referring to the Places, where he says they may be found; <HI>Vol.</HI> II. <HI>Fol.</HI> 378, 396, 402, 403. — And only give you in Parentheses, what is necessary to clear the <HI>Clergyman</HI>'s Observations upon 'em, which are these. He says (<HI>p.</HI> 48.) <Q>Having quoted Bp. <HI>Burnet</HI> pretty largely on the Case, you may expect I shou'd set down <HI>his Opinion</HI> of it; but truly, his <HI>Lordship</HI> seems to <HI>give up the Point,</HI> and rather excuses it from the Confusion the Church was then in, than offers at a plain Vindication. However, upon the whole, 'tis plain, our <HI>Reformers</HI> were under some <HI>Difficulties</HI> in this Affair of the <HI>Consecration</HI> [viz. of Archbishop <HI>Parker;</HI> the See of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> being vacant by the Death of Card, <HI>Pool,</HI> as also were some other Sees, at Queen <HI>Elisabeth</HI>'s Accession] Otherwise the first Commission [or Warrant for <HI>Parker</HI>'s Consecration] wou'd not have been directed to three Bishops, who had <HI>forfeited their Sees</HI> by an Act of Parlia∣ment pass'd that very Year, Or (upon their re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>using to
<PB N="25" REF="003651_0079_10023C574D55D568"/>act) the <HI>second,</HI> to one <HI>quondam</HI> Bishop (whom they <HI>never restor'd</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Coverdale.</HI> He refus'd it; being <HI>disaffected</HI> to be Ceremonies and Habits: and it's remarkable, he attended the <HI>Consecration</HI> only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>plain black COAT.</HI></NOTE>) two Bishops <HI>elect,</HI> and two <HI>Suffragans:</HI> [the two <HI>old Bishops,</HI> the only ones, with <HI>Sees,</HI> named in the Commission, had <HI>no manner of Share</HI> in the Consecration; only one of the <HI>Suffragans</HI> assisted, who, as the Case then stood (says the Bp.) I am afraid cou'd have no Power to do it.] Especially, if we further observe, That in the <HI>Letters Patents</HI> for the Con∣secration of the first Bishops, the QUEEN, <HI>for avoiding all Ambiguity, and Questions, that might be objected against the same; hath, by her</HI> SUPREME <HI>Power and Authority,</HI> DIS∣PENSED <HI>with all Causes and doubt of any</HI> IMPERFECTION <HI>or</HI> DISABILITY, <HI>that can, or may, be objected to it.</HI> This, as the <HI>Statute</HI> says, was <HI>a Caution which had not been us'd in Letters Patents of the same Nature;</HI> and therefore may give one Reason to suspect, that the <HI>Legality</HI> of the Proceeding was not so clear, as one cou'd wish it: and this Suspicion is confirm'd by the Act of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which pass'd in the Eighth Year of her Reign, <HI>Declaring all the Consecrations, that had been since the Queen's Accession,</HI> VALID;</Q> <HI>any Matter</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thing, that can, or may, be objected to the Contrary, notwith∣standing;</HI> <Q>— PROVIDED, <HI>that no Person</HI> &amp;c. — This Proviso refers to the <HI>Statute</HI> of the 5th of Q <HI>Eliz.</HI> cap. 1. By which, all Archbishops, and Bishops, are empower'd to tender the <HI>Oath of Supremacy</HI> —. So that the <HI>Parliament,</HI> tho' they <HI>confirm'd</HI> the Bishops in their Sees; yet not con∣firming, but on the Contrary, excepting, and vacating those <HI>Acts</HI> of theirs which regarded the Liberty and Pro∣perty of a third Person, have virtually <HI>declar'd,</HI> that they did <HI>not</HI> look upon 'em as <HI>good</HI> Bishops before this Act pass'd; for if they had been, these <HI>Tenders</HI> of the <HI>Oath,</HI> which they made <HI>as Bishops,</HI> and under the Sanction of an Act of Par∣liament, wou'd have been <HI>valid.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Besides (as he goes on to observe) if we put our Cause on the Foot of a <HI>Divine</HI> Commission, will not the <HI>Sectaries</HI> retort upon us, That either the <HI>Popish</HI> Bishops had a Divine Commission, or they had none: If they <HI>had,</HI> how cou'd they be <HI>depriv'd</HI> of it, even by an Act of Parliament; and consequently, what Right had <HI>those</HI> who <HI>succeeded</HI> them? If they had <HI>not,</HI> how came <HI>we</HI> by it, who claim under their
<PB N="26" REF="003651_0080_10023C63D08199E8"/>Consecrations? So that I think, instead of insisting <HI>loudly</HI> on our <HI>Divine Right,</HI> as you and other <HI>indiscreet</HI> Men have done; we had better let that Matter pass over in <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lence</HI> (unless now and then we introduce it in the <HI>Pulpit</HI>) and rest upon our <HI>National, Legal</HI> Establishment, which will serve our Turn as well.</Q>— The <HI>Clergyman</HI> concludes his Letter, with a just Reprehension to Mr. <HI>Peers</HI> (which is ap∣plicable perhaps to many others of his Brethren) saying, <Q>I cou'd not forbear letting you know, that I think <HI>weak</HI> Arguments <HI>betray</HI> the Cause they are brought to support, and that our Church has <HI>suffer'd</HI> (and unless more Care be taken in the Choice of <HI>our Champions,</HI> is likely to suffer) more by the <HI>Folly</HI> of its <HI>Friends,</HI> than by the Malice of its Enemies.</Q>— Now, I appeal to <HI>Eusebius,</HI> whether the mani∣fest Defect of <HI>Canonical Ordination</HI> in <HI>Parker</HI>'s Case, as it is repre∣sented by the <HI>Clergyman,</HI> do's not infer a Breach of regular <HI>Succession:</HI> and if the Legality of all the following Conse∣crations depended entirely on <HI>Parker</HI>'s, who then from a private Clergyman was promoted to the Archiepiscopal See of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> I leave <HI>Eusebius</HI> to draw the Consequence: Expecting he will cry out, Verily this Gentleman STRIKES HIGH with a Witness, I had almost said, with a Vengeance: <HI>higher still</HI> than even Bp. <HI>Hoadly;</HI> the Bp. as high as the <HI>Revolution,</HI> but this Clergyman as high as the very REFORMATION, <HI>and will</HI> UNDO <HI>us all</HI> indeed.— Ay, that he will, <HI>Eusebius,</HI> if your darling Principles be true: but as WE <HI>have not so learn'd Christ,</HI> the Reformation shines yet gloriously in <HI>our</HI> Eyes, and the Succession is still secure and good. And truly You must be oblig'd to <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Principles, to make out the Validity of your Episcopal Ordinations: Or I doubt, there remains not a <HI>good Bishop</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> but they must all be voted <HI>at the best mere human Creatures,</HI> upon your own Plan. Thus we have seen <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s terrible UNDOING Position confirm'd in <HI>two Senses,</HI> which it fairly admits of; the one Consideration was of a <HI>Political,</HI> the other of an <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Nature</P>
<P>There is <HI>another Sense</HI> I will now mention, which the Position may also be taken in, and in which it must be acknowledg'd undoubtedly true; and that is, a <HI>Prelate,</HI> consider'd RESPEC∣TIVELY, or <HI>Relatively,</HI> is but <HI>a human Creature:</HI> First, re∣spectively to <HI>Eusebius</HI> himself; Secondly, to <HI>us</HI> in <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>Will <HI>Eusebius</HI> dare to say, A Prelate in Relation to <HI>him</HI> is any thing more than a mere human Creature, without all <HI>Power to ordain!</HI> For how <HI>Divine</HI> soever a Bp. be simply in him∣self,
<PB N="27" REF="003651_0080_10023C63D08199E8"/>yet <HI>Respectively</HI> he is at best but a <HI>human</HI> Creature, and can't pretend to work the MIRACLE of transforming an <HI>unbaptiz'd Laick</HI> into a <HI>Christian Minister.</HI> That's a moral Impossibility!</P>
<P>I take this Opportunity to invite <HI>Eusebius,</HI> with his Fraternity, to a more serious Reflection upon their own <HI>real State,</HI> in point of <HI>visible Christianity:</HI> and beg he will for Charity sake give Satisfaction to some Scruples, a solution to certain Diffi∣culties, arising on that head.— Sir, I solemnly put the Question, Can you upon your professed Principles make out an authentick Claim (<HI>foro Ecclesiae</HI>) to the Character of <HI>Christian?</HI> I insist on a generous and direct Answer. Pray, do your self Justice, upon this Occasion; and let the <HI>Secret</HI> come abroad, if you have ever received any <HI>other</HI> than <HI>Lay-Baptism.</HI> For if <HI>not,</HI> I must have Leave to doubt, the <HI>Bishop's Hand</HI> has no such miraculous Virtue, as to supply the ESSENTIAL <HI>Defect</HI> in that Case. Certainly, my Friend, if as a <HI>Christian Professor</HI> you are of a LAY-<HI>Extract,</HI> you can't as a <HI>Christian Minister</HI> challenge any higher Original. You may well look on your self still, notwithstanding your Episcopal Orders, but <HI>a pretending Laick,</HI> as much as before. Surely you must needs receive Conviction by this, that <HI>Respectively</HI> to You, at least a <HI>Prelate is at best but a human Creature:</HI> for it was impossible for him to make a <HI>Divine</HI> one of <HI>You;</HI> I mean, of one in your <HI>Circumstances;</HI> a mere <HI>human</HI> Creature, without <HI>Episcopal</HI> Baptism. Read now, and apply to your self what you find pertinent to your Case, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.17—23.</P>
<P>It remains, that we consider the <HI>Prelates</HI> in Relation to <HI>us,</HI> the Ministers and Churches of <HI>New England.</HI> I premise this Observation, That a <HI>Prelate</HI> is a relative Term, and (as one expresses it) <HI>always connotes a</HI> BISHOPRICK, <HI>as his Charge and Cure.</HI> The Prelate's Power is limited, and none is <HI>Bishop of another Man's Diocese,</HI> nor can the Bi∣shops display their Power in such Parts even of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as are <HI>exempted</HI> by Law from Prelatical Jurisdiction, and govern'd by Courts held by dignify'd <HI>Presbyters.</HI> The Bp. (notwithstanding his specious Title of <HI>chief</HI> Governor) passes but for a mere <HI>human Creature</HI> in the <HI>Peculiars:</HI> and why shou'd he pass for any other among us in <HI>New-England,</HI> who are at least as much privileg'd as they! Certainly the <HI>Regal</HI> Authority, having the Right of <HI>Nomination,</HI> has equal Pretences to the Right of <HI>Suspension:</HI> the same Authority that gives the <HI>Power</HI> of external Jurisdiction, may lay what <HI>Re∣striction</HI> is thought fit, on the <HI>Exercise</HI> of it, either total or
<PB N="28" REF="003651_0081_10023C7BA94863D0"/>partial, &amp; <HI>exempt</HI> any part of the King's Dominions there from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow such has been the ROYAL GRACE to <HI>New England</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Particular, that we are indulg'd with the great and IN∣ESTIMABLE. Privilege of an INTIRE EXEMPTION from <HI>Episcopal</HI> Impositions, by the excellent Establishment, Charter and Laws, we are under. So that altho' in a <HI>Civil</HI> Consi∣deration we are <HI>dependent</HI> Provinces, and gladly will ever remain so (loyal to the Crown, and dutiful to the Mother-Kingdom) yet we are (in fact and right) independent <HI>Churches;</HI> by the Royal Indulgence, resign'd to a perfect Liberty in <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Regards. Surely the Prelates are all in Effect DEPRIV'D <HI>Bishops,</HI> as to <HI>us;</HI> depriv'd by a most sufficient Authority, to all Intents and Purposes. But if I am so very <HI>unhappy</HI> as to have been mistaken, I desire <HI>Eusebius</HI> to be so kind, as to set me right, and inform us WHOSE <HI>Diocese</HI> we pertain to, that we may be no longer ignorant <HI>who</HI> is our Bp. Will he undertake to decide the grand Dispute at this day between the Bp. of <HI>London,</HI> and the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury!</HI> For my own part, I know of no Act of Parliament, that vests the Title in the Bp. of <HI>London;</HI> without which, his Claim is merely presumptive. But it may be, this Gentleman will think it his wisest way, to say, we are as yet only subject to the <HI>Archiepiscopal</HI> Jurisdiction, like the Peculiars in <HI>England.</HI> Well, to this it's answered, <Q><HI>They are no otherwise under it</HI> (and consequently <HI>we</HI> are no more under it) <HI>than even the</HI> BI∣SHOPS <HI>are: and the prelatical Party themselves acknowledge, that Archbishops are but of Human Institution.</HI></Q> We may therefore without all hazard, conclude, that a <HI>Prelate</HI> is at best but a human Creature <HI>Respectively,</HI> &amp; in Relation to us Whether you look upon him in a Legal or an Ecclesiastical Consideration, he is unto <HI>us,</HI> I say, <HI>at best a more human Creature.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole then, what has this Writer got by his noisy Bustle and Outcry against that hurtless Passage of <HI>Elutherius!</HI> Here indeed we have <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Master-Objection, and what he values himself most upon; or to allude to a Phrase of his own, <HI>"triumphs upon, as the foundation of the finest Flou∣rishes in his Dialogues."</HI> But I flatter my self, the Flowers are cropt and spoil'd, and his Triumphs at an End.</P>
<P>I come now to the other Thing I had in View.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am to do Justice to <HI>Elutherius,</HI> in giving the <HI>true Sense</HI> of the Passage under Consideration, as intended by <HI>him:</HI> which alone wou'd have suffic'd presently to dissipate the furious Storm rais'd upon this slight Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003651_0081_10023C7BA94863D0"/>
And as I observ'd before, this Passage, as it stands in the Dialogue, has evidently an immediate Relation to the Bishop's <HI>Jurisdiction.</HI> 'Tis level'd against the <HI>Constitution,</HI> and Frame of the English Hierarchy in general; but more particularly against the <Q><HI>imposing</HI> of their Minister (as the manner is) upon a Congregation, without the <HI>People</HI>'s Consent: which <HI>Elutherius</HI> thinks an unsufferable <HI>Lordship</HI> over them. And therefore says, I care not to be set over a People in this <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> manner.—I cannot but complain of the <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> &amp;c.— Nor do I find any Warrant for the Ecclesi∣astical Authority exercis'd over both Ministers and People in the Bishop's <HI>Name.</HI> If there be— shew it me; if not, you'l allow me to <HI>refuse your Hierarchy</HI> &amp;c.</Q> (Dial. p. 6, 7.) These are his express Words: and you see, they apparently respect Things <HI>consequential</HI> to Ordination. And as it unlucki∣ly happens, <HI>Eusebius</HI> himself brings in the <HI>Passage</HI> he cavils at, expresly under the head of <Q><HI>what</HI> Eleutherius <HI>has said against the Episcopal</HI> CONSTITUTION,</Q> (p. 24) yet quickly forget∣ing this, and resolv'd upon a perverse Comment, he after∣wards treats the disputed Sentence as <HI>particularly</HI> referring to ORDINATION, and has the Front to say to <HI>Elutherius</HI> (p. 26.) <Q><HI>It is</HI> CERTAIN, <HI>You design'd a Slur upon our Ordination among your vulgar Readers, by your unfair Insinuation, when you call a Prelate a human Creature, and your Ordinations such as are according to Christ</HI>'s <HI>Institution,</HI> p. 9. <HI>as though ours were not so.</HI></Q> This, however, is a Consequence far fetcht, <HI>"as any one may see with half an Eye,"</HI> comparing <HI>pages</HI> 5th &amp; 9th: For at that Distance the two <HI>Premises</HI> stand, from which he makes up his formidable <HI>Conclusion.</HI></P>
<P>Well! Nevertheless, to give him the fairest Play he can desire, I will for once suppose <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Words to come in under the head of <HI>Ordination,</HI> as an Objection against the <HI>Epis∣copal</HI> Way. But what mighty Use will our Adversary be able to make of this Concession, in Prejudice to the Argument in hand! Why, let this Gentleman put <HI>his own</HI> uncouth and ill-natur'd sense upon the Words so apply'd, and then it will furnish out a little <HI>Rant</HI> upon <HI>Elutherius.</HI> But certainly a small Degree of <HI>Candour</HI> (that friendly Candour we all upon Occasion need some Assistance from, and none perhaps more than <HI>Eusebius</HI> and I) wou'd have taught this Gentleman to pit the <HI>favourable Construction,</HI> which he knew well enough the Words wou'd admit of, and cou'd not rationally think a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> other was intended. Yet observe, when <HI>Elutherius</HI> says,
<PB N="30" REF="003651_0082_10023CBD43242F18"/><HI>"a Prelate is at best but a human Creature,"</HI> this Gentleman will have him intend to divest the Bp. of his whole <HI>ministerial</HI> Character, and leave him without the common Powers of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> Verily He might as well have infer'd, that he meant, a Prelate is not a <HI>Christian,</HI> any more than a Divine: or truly he might as well have infer'd, he meant to insinuate, that a Bp. is a <HI>Fool;</HI> for so still he wou'd be <HI>a human Creature.</HI> — But I'm asham'd of his trifling Cavils, and his <Q><HI>unfair Insinuation, which cou'd not be design'd for any thing but a</HI> SLUR <HI>upon</HI> Elutherius, <HI>among his vulgar Readers.</HI></Q> He well enough knew, however the Words may sound, Nothing more was really intended by 'em, than that <Q><HI>Prelacy it self is not of Divine Appointment, but of human Invention</HI></Q>: and he saw it so explain'd by <HI>Elutherius</HI> himself, in those very Terms. (<HI>Dial.</HI> p. 7.) This Gentleman could have distinguish'd, if he had pleas'd, between the <HI>Person</HI> and the <HI>Character:</HI> or rather between the constitutive Character of <HI>Minister,</HI> and the accumula∣tive Character of <HI>Prelate.</HI> The first is <HI>from Heaven:</HI> the second is <HI>of the Earth.</HI> Prelates, <HI>as such,</HI> Elutherius denies to be of a <HI>Divine</HI> Make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but yet consider'd in another Light, i. e. as <HI>Ministers,</HI> he denies not their being of Christ's appointing.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>Eusebius</HI> at length do's him the Justice, to make a Distinction, and bring him in saying, <Q><HI>I never deny'd Bishops the power of ordaining as</HI> PRESBYTERS, <HI>but only as Prelates.</HI></Q> Truly it was a Thing too notorious to be dissem∣bled, that <HI>Elutherius</HI> has never once seem'd to call in Question the <HI>Validity</HI> of a Bishop's Ordination, i. e. of Ordination by a Bishop in <HI>Conjunction with other Presbyters.</HI> All that he dis∣putes, is the <HI>Necessity</HI> of a <HI>Prelate</HI> in Ordination, and the <HI>Re∣gularity</HI> of the English <HI>Episcopal Manner</HI> of Ordination, taken in all its <HI>Circumstances,</HI> as he has set them forth at large. (<HI>Dial.</HI> p. 8, 9.) And the very <HI>worst</HI> he can be suppos'd to aim at, was (as he expresses himself, <HI>Ibid.</HI>) <Q><HI>the assigning Reasons why he esteem'd</HI> Presbyterian <HI>Ordination every way</HI> preferable <HI>to Ordination by Bishops.</HI></Q> Now certainly, so far as <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordination is attended with Circumstances IRRE∣GULAR and UNSCRIPTURAL, <HI>"the want of Christ</HI>'s <HI>Appoint∣ment,"</HI> with respect to those Things, might fairly be ob∣jected in Plea against it, and be assign'd as a Reason for re∣fusing Ordination in <HI>that Manner,</HI> and "<HI>seeking Ordination</HI> (as he has expressed it) <HI>where all these Abuses may be regulated.</HI>" And this the <HI>rather,</HI> since in the present agreable Posture of Affairs, as the Door of publick Liberty stands open to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣testant
<PB N="31" REF="003651_0082_10023CBD43242F18"/>Dissenters at home, so the <HI>Anti-Prelatical</HI> Way is the <HI>primitive</HI> &amp; <HI>prevailing</HI> Way of <HI>New England,</HI> ESTABLISH'D by ancient Custom, general Agreement, and the Recom∣mendation of Civil Authority; which gives as good a Sanction to it, as the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Way has in the Mother-Country. <HI>Pre∣latical</HI> Ordination is "a <HI>Deviation from a settled Method, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ful in our Judgment, without a Necessity for such a Deviation.</HI>" I bor∣row the Language from Bp. <HI>Hoadly;</HI> and if there be any Strength in the Argument, as he applies it against Dr. <HI>Cala∣my,</HI> it must be allow'd to have the same Force in my Ap∣plication of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against <HI>Eusebius.</HI> I will also borrow a few Words from Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> (Mod. None. <HI>P.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 425.) who having spoken of the unwarrantable Clogs attending Episcopal Ordination, takes Occasion to say; <Q>In that respect, I sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t stick to declare, that I no more approve of the Method of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than of the Method even of the <HI>Brownists.</HI> I no more think, that a Separation to the Office of the Ministry, <HI>with such Clogs</HI> superadded, is <HI>approved of God, regular, and warranted by Scripture,</HI> than I do, that a Separation to the Office, <HI>without any Concern</HI> of Ministers, is so, where their Judgment and Help can be had.</Q> The <HI>superadded Engagements</HI> on the one side, are as bad as the <HI>Omission</HI> on the other: and as little <HI>dispensable</HI> in our Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> IX. <HI>Eusebius</HI> shews a remarkable Confidence (not to say, Baseness) by insinuating again, notwithstanding the Dis∣tinction and Caution before given him, as if <HI>Elutherius</HI> really intended to deny the <HI>Validity</HI> of <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordinations; "<HI>Which</HI> (says he, <HI>p.</HI> 26.) <HI>you would fain</HI> NULL." Verily one wou'd think, this Gentleman was so <HI>possess'd</HI> with the <HI>Nullity</HI> of <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI> Ordination, that it has strange Effects upon him; his Brain seems addl'd, and he talks as if he could not muse upon any thing, but <HI>Nullity,</HI> NULLITY! The Word sounds in his Ears continually, in the manner of an <HI>Echo;</HI> and he fancies he hears it from all Quarters, on every Occasion. As <HI>Ill-will</HI> is is always <HI>jealous,</HI> he imagins his Opponent must needs be haunted with the same evil <HI>nullifying</HI> Spirit, as himself. —Again, COMMISSION, SUCCESSION, LAY-DERIVATION, are Ecclesiastical Terms of Art and Cant, <HI>favorite</HI> and <HI>familiar</HI> Terms (I doubt not) with this Gentleman. Upon which I must recall to his Mind a beautiful and pertinent Period of his own (p. 14) <Q>YOU LOVE TO HARP <HI>upon those Things, that you think will move People's Affections to</HI> OUTRUN THEIR REASON.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003651_0083_10023CB883272CB8"/>
<HI>Eusebius</HI> (p. 26.) with a formidable <HI>Dilemma</HI> pushes at us: but we don't feel our selves at all go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d by either of its hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. As for <HI>his</HI> Presbyters, let 'em shift for themselves: Our Concern is to vindicate our own. And we are not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond, we confess, of an uninterrupted <HI>Line</HI> of <HI>Succession,</HI> nor much scar'd at the Consequences of a Breach in the Chain. We are not afraid of <HI>"pretending to a Commission to begin a new Succession,"</HI> sufficient to the Purpose, whether it be <HI>immediate</HI> or only mediate, if there were Occasion. This Gentleman, I believe, labours of some Confusion in his Thoughts about the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Ordination,</HI> and has not learn'd yet the necessary Distinction between <HI>Com∣mission</HI> and <HI>Investiture;</HI> which are certainly very different Things. To help his Understanding a little, I will illustrate the Matter by a familiar Case of the like Nature. The <HI>Mas∣sachusetts</HI> Explanatory Charter gives to our House of <HI>Repre∣sentatives</HI> the Power of <HI>chusing</HI> a SPEAKER, and to the <HI>Governor</HI> the Power of <HI>approbating</HI> him: yet neither the E∣lection nor the Approbation do's properly <HI>constitute</HI> or make him Speaker; but it's the <HI>King,</HI> who does this, by the <HI>Char∣ter,</HI> as his Instrument. The King appoints the Officer: They only design the Person. The King gives the <HI>Commission:</HI> They only the <HI>Investiture.</HI> The Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion gives the <HI>Power:</HI> and the Investiture leads on the regular <HI>Exercise</HI> of it. Now 'tis the same in the Case before us. The <HI>People</HI> chuse, and the <HI>Presbytery</HI> approbate by solemn Rites and publick Actions: thus the consenting Candidate becomes regularly invested, and introduc'd into the Exercise of those Powers, which are given to Ministers by the Gospel, the fundamental <HI>Charter of</HI> the Church. The sacred Scriptures are the Minister's Letters of <HI>Credence,</HI> which give him all his Authority. Hence Dr. <HI>Stilling∣fleet</HI> observes; <Q>The Pastors of the Church ought to be receiv'd but according to that Power and Authority, which their CREDENTIALS, viz. the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> do CONVEY to them.</Q> (<HI>Rat. Acco. Prot. Relig.</HI> p. 260.) Let <HI>Eusebius</HI> read also what his judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> (Eccl. Pol. <HI>p.</HI> 331, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) has offer'd in Confutation of the Allegorical Argument taken from a STOLEN SEAL; which is so commonly bro't against <HI>Presby∣terian</HI> Baptism and Orders, to prove them <HI>null,</HI> and us quilty of <HI>Forgery</HI> and <HI>Sacrilege.</HI> What will <HI>Eusebius</HI> make of those Remarks of the Ecclesiastical Politician; (p. 332.) <Q>That God hath committed the <HI>Minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rie</HI> of Baptisme unto <HI>special</HI> Men, it is for ORDER'S sake in his Church, and not to the End that <HI>their Authoritie</HI> might give <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> or add <HI>Force</HI> to the
<PB N="33" REF="003651_0083_10023CB883272CB8"/>Sacrament if selfe.</Q> (p. 333.) The Worke of <HI>external Ministerie</HI> "in Baptisme is <HI>onely</HI> a <HI>Preeminence</HI> of <HI>Honor.</HI>"—He defines Ordination (<HI>p.</HI> 124.) "a solemn Admittance." And (<HI>p.</HI> 435.) he observes, <Q>That the <HI>onely</HI> true and proper Act of <HI>Ordina∣tion</HI> is, to INVEST Men with that Power which doth make them Ministers, by <HI>consecrating</HI> their Persons to God and his Service in holy Things.— They are by virtue thereof <HI>bequeathed</HI> unto God, <HI>severed</HI> and <HI>sanctified</HI> to be imployed in his Service. (<HI>p.</HI> 434.)— Which Men, thereunto assign∣ed, doe hold their Authoritie from <HI>God</HI> (Who should give them their Commission, but HE?) whether they be such as Himselfe immediately or as the CHURCH <HI>in his Name in∣vesteth.</HI> (p. 410.)—And he observes (<HI>p.</HI> 322.) <HI>External Cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umstances,</HI> even in the <HI>highest</HI> and <HI>holiest</HI> Actions, are but the <HI>lesser Things of the Law</HI> (Matth. 23.23.) where∣unto those Actions themselves being compared are the <HI>greater;</HI> and therefore as the greater are of such Importance that they <HI>must be done,</HI> so in that Extremitie before supposed [in Cases of Necessity] if our <HI>Acount</HI> of the <HI>lesser</HI> which are <HI>not to be omitted,</HI> should cause Omission of that which is <HI>more</HI> to be <HI>accounted</HI> of, were not this our <HI>strict</HI> Obedience to Christ's Institution touching <HI>Mint</HI> and <HI>Commin,</HI> a <HI>Dis∣obedience</HI> to his Institution concerning <HI>Love?</HI>— AWAY with these <HI>mercilesse</HI> and <HI>bloodie</HI> Sentences! Let them never bee found standing in the Books and Writings of a <HI>Christian</HI> Man: They <HI>savour not of</HI> CHRIST, nor of his most gracious and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke Spirit, but under Colour of <HI>exact</HI> O∣bedience they nourish <HI>Crueltie</HI> and <HI>Hardness</HI> of Heart.</Q> Now let this be apply'd to the Case we are upon; and I think it sufficient to solve all the Difficulties about <HI>beginning a new Succession</HI> &amp;c. I shall add here that Passage of Mr. <HI>Chilling∣worth</HI> (Relig of Prof. p. 354.) <Q>There is no Repugnance in the Terms, but that there might be a true Church after <HI>Luther,</HI> though there was <HI>none</HI> for some <HI>Ages</HI> before. For it does not appear (says he) that the <HI>Generation</HI> of Churches is <HI>univocal;</HI> that nothing but a <HI>Church</HI> can possibly beget a <HI>Church.</HI>— For a <HI>false</HI> Church may preserve the MEANS — of raising a <HI>true</HI> Church; I mean the Integrity and Authority of the WORD of God with Men.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Eusebius</HI> go's on; <Q><HI>The most of you indeed have so mingled your Succession from Episcopacy, with</HI> LAY-DERIVATIONS, <HI>by uniting with the Independents, that 'tis hard to say, what Foundation you now stand upon.</HI></Q> Well, what then! Surely we have no
<PB N="34" REF="003651_0084_10023CC36CA97CA8"/>more Reason to be afraid, than <HI>himself,</HI> of the terrible Con∣sequence of these <HI>Lay-Derivations,</HI> which he supposes have been mingled with our Succession from Episcopacy. I answer him, in his own Words (p. 42) <HI>"This would be but a Gingle, if you did suppose so, and not at all serve you."</HI> Eusebius's LAY-DERIVATIONS make a pleasant Chime with the Bishop's LAY-DEPRIVATIONS, we heard of before: and as it happens, the Words vary but in one trifling <HI>Letter.</HI> Now when this Gen∣tleman will undertake to defend the <HI>latter,</HI> and ward off its evil Consequences; I believe I shall be able, on the same or as good Grounds, easily to defend the <HI>former,</HI> and hold up a Shield against its formidable Train of Consequences, how tra∣gically soever they are represented. For, methinks, the Con∣sequences will come out pretty much the same, and equally affect the Business of Ordination.—And if he could prove, that we have in fact so mingled our Succession from Episcopacy with Lay-Derivations, as he says, the Gingle <HI>would not serve him,</HI> nor do I know how it would hurt us. In short, when <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> will undertake to prove, he is a true <HI>Christian,</HI> notwithstand∣ing his <HI>Lay-Baptism,</HI> I will attempt to prove, I am a true <HI>Mi∣nister</HI> of Christ, notwithstanding any <HI>Lay-Derivation,</HI> possible in my Case, <HI>"by uniting with the Independents."</HI> Truly, I fear, this Gentleman and his Fraternity, have <HI>mingled,</HI> shall I say? or defiled their <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> to <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> in as bad a sense as we have our <HI>Succession</HI> from it, <HI>with Lay-Derivations.</HI> What a foul Mix∣ture is <HI>Lay Baptism</HI> and <HI>Apostolical Ordination!</HI> Is not this a mingling Heaven and Earth together! I may return him his own Language, <Q><HI>It is hard to say, what Foundation you now stand on; and you might have justified your selves better upon</HI> INDEPENDENT <HI>Principles: but only you are something too late; having all of you for some time past agreed to set the Laity aside, as having no Part or Lot in this Affair; so that having asserted the Right of Ordination</HI> to be, not in the People, nor in <HI>the Presbytery,</HI> but wholly and only in the Bishop, <HI>by Christ</HI>'s <HI>Insti∣tution, you have nulled all Lay-Ordinations,</HI></Q> and therefore all Lay-Baptisms; the Consequence of which is, you have fairly null'd <HI>your own</HI> Ordination, tho' done by an <HI>Episcopal</HI> Hand. For your <HI>Lay-Baptism</HI> was an Error in the first Concoction, that cou'd not be mended in the second. The application of an <HI>Episcopal Hand</HI> has not yet the virtue of such a sovereign <HI>Alte∣rative,</HI> as by any secret Operation, to change your moral Constitution, and cure your old Distemperature.—Certainly an <HI>unbapti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Minister</HI> is as odd a Concrete, as gross a Solecism,
<PB N="35" REF="003651_0084_10023CC36CA97CA8"/>as can readily be thought of. You had better verily have stuck to your <HI>Independent</HI> Principles: you wou'd then have stood on a surer Foundation, than the fruitless subsequent Act of Episcopal Ordination, which can't confirm a Nullity.</P>
<P>And now, if you wou'd know how we can justify our selves upon INDEPENDENT <HI>Principles,</HI> I might refer you to almost all the celebrated <HI>Authors,</HI> that have wrote in Defence of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> Episcopal as well as others; whom you will find leaning very much to Independent Principles, and defending the Reformation upon this grand Principle of the Independents. That <HI>the Body of the Faithful have all Ecclesiastical Power lodg'd with them, in the last Resort, for the Security &amp; Preservation of the Church.</HI> But perhaps it may contribute more to <HI>this Gentleman</HI>'s Satis∣faction and Conviction, if I can produce something to the purpose out of the <HI>Authors</HI> he himself has alledg'd against us in the present Dispute. Let him please then to consult his own (shall I say? or rather our) applauded STIL∣LINGFLEET In his <HI>Rational Account of the Protestant Religion,</HI> he has many Passages to our Purpose. I shall single out these few. See <HI>Pag.</HI> 53, 54. <Q>A <HI>Church</HI>— is only a <HI>Combination</HI> of Men together, upon the <HI>belief</HI> of such a <HI>Doctrine</HI> as <HI>neces∣sary</HI> to <HI>Salvation;</HI> and for the <HI>Performance</HI> of those <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> which are <HI>suitable</HI> thereto.— We must <HI>distinguish</HI> those Things in the Catholick Church, which give its <HI>Being,</HI> from those Things which are the proper <HI>Acts</HI> of it, as the Catholick Church. As to this <HI>latter,</HI> the solemn <HI>Worship</HI> of God in the way prescribed by him, is necessary; in order to which there must be supposed lawful OFFICERS set in the Church, and <HI>Sacraments</HI> duly administred: But THESE, I say, are rather the EXERCISE of the COMMUNI∣ON of the Catholick Church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than that which gives it its BEING; which is, the <HI>Belief</HI> of that <HI>Religion,</HI> whereupon its <HI>Substance</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> depends; and as long as a <HI>Church</HI> retains <HI>this,</HI> it keeps its <HI>Being,</HI> though the <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Per∣fection</HI> of it depends upon the due Exercise of all <HI>Acts</HI> of Communion in it.— Whatsoever <HI>Church</HI> imposeth the <HI>Belief</HI> of OTHER things <HI>as necessary to Salvation,</HI> which were not so <HI>antecedently</HI> necessary to the <HI>Being</HI> of the Catho∣lick Church, doth, as much as in it lies, BREAK the <HI>Unity</HI> of it; and those <HI>Churches,</HI> who desire to preserve its <HI>Unity,</HI> are bound thereby <HI>not to have Communion</HI> with it so long as it doth so.</Q> — These now are right Reformation-Principles: and who does not see that these are the very
<PB N="36" REF="003651_0085_10023CBAE3C1E288"/>Spirit of Independentism! I am one that happens to be <Q><HI>united with the Independents,</HI></Q> and shou'd know their Principles. If the Harmony between the Doctor and us be call'd upon Trial, I appeal to the Judgment of Mr. LOWTH, a zealous <HI>Episcopalian.</HI> "The immediate Result of this arguing, says he upon these Passages (Letter to Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> p. 67.) is <Q>—That a Man may be a <HI>Christian,</HI> and not a <HI>Church-Member:</HI> That the <HI>Being</HI> of the Church is not necessary to <HI>Salvation;</HI> That the Church is a <HI>subsequent Combination</HI> for Acts of <HI>Worship:</HI> That <HI>Church Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs</HI> are not of the <HI>Essence</HI> of the Church: — That <HI>Schism,</HI> which is a Breach of the Churches Union, do's not relate to <HI>Church Officers,</HI> in their Church <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Canons</HI></Q> &amp;c. These are some of the Opinions he fastens upon the Doctor; and con∣cludes with observing to him, <Q>Hereby you give support and Countenance to the many <HI>Sectaries</HI> among us.</Q> Certainly he do's so to the <HI>Independents,</HI> whom this his Episcopal Ad∣versary mentions in particular.</P>
<P>The next Author I shall quote, is judicious HOOKER. Let us first attend his Description of the Church. <Q>Seeing that <HI>the Church</HI> (says he, <HI>Eccl. Pol.</HI> p. 367.) is a Name which Art hath given to the <HI>Professors of true Religion;</HI> as they which will define a <HI>Man,</HI> are to passe by those Qua∣lities wherein one Man doth excell another, and to take onely those <HI>essential</HI> Properties, whereby a Man doth differ from Creatures of other kinds: So he that will teach <HI>what</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> is, shall never rightly performe the Worke where∣about hee goeth, till in <HI>Matter of Religion</HI> hee touch that <HI>Difference,</HI> which severeth the <HI>Churches Religion</HI> from Theirs, who are <HI>not</HI> the Church. — Whereupon, because the <HI>onely Object,</HI> which separa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> ours from other Religions, is <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in whom none but the Church doth believe, and whom none but the Church doth worship, wee find that accordingly the <HI>Apostles</HI> doe every-where dis∣tinguish hereby the Church from Infidels and from Jews; accounting <HI>them which call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> to bee his <HI>Church.</HI> If we goe lower, we shall but adde unto this certaine casuall and variable <HI>Accidents,</HI> which are not properly of the <HI>Being,</HI> but make onely for the <HI>happier</HI> and <HI>better</HI> Being of the Church</Q> &amp;c. If I mistake not, a great Deal to our Purpose is comprehended in this significant Period: but I forbear Remarks. And now I undertake to vindicate our Ordinations, howsoever we may have "mingled our Succession
<PB N="37" REF="003651_0085_10023CBAE3C1E288"/>from Episcopacy with <HI>Lay-derivations,</HI>" upon the same or as good Principles, as judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> has justify'd <HI>Lay-Baptisms</HI> upon. It may not be amiss to transcribe a few Passages of his upon that Head, for the Entertainment of this Gentleman and the Information of our <HI>"Vulgar Readers."</HI> (See <HI>Eccl. Pol.</HI> p. 327 &amp;c.) <Q>If Baptisme (says he) seriously be administred in the same <HI>Element,</HI> and with the same <HI>Forme of Words,</HI> which Christ's Institution teacheth, <HI>there is</HI> NO OTHER DEFECT in the World, that can make it <HI>frustrate,</HI> or deprive it of the Nature of a <HI>true</HI> Sacrament. — <HI>Are not many Things</HI> FIRM, <HI>being done,</HI> altho' in <HI>part</HI> done <HI>otherwise</HI> than positive <HI>Rigor</HI> and <HI>Strictnesse</HI> did require? <HI>Nature,</HI> as much as is possible, inclineth unto VALIDITIES and <HI>Preservations.</HI> Dissolutions and NULLITIES of things <HI>done</HI> are not only not favoured, but <HI>hated,</HI> when either urg'd without Cause, or extended beyond their Reach: if therefore at any time it come to passe, that in <HI>teaching</HI> publikely or privately, in delivering this blessed <HI>Sacrament</HI></Q> [of Baptism; he might as well by parity of Reason have added, in delivering the Sa∣crament of the holy <HI>Supper,</HI> and in <HI>ordaining</HI> Persons to the Ministry] <Q>some <HI>unsanctified Hand</HI> contrarie to Christ's sup∣posed Ordinance do <HI>intrude</HI> it selfe to execute that, where∣upon the Lawes of God and his Church have <HI>deputed others;</HI> Which of these <HI>two Opinions</HI> seemeth more agreable with <HI>Equity?</HI> OURS, that disallow what is done amisse, yet make NOT the FORCE of the <HI>Word and Sacraments,</HI> much lesse their NATURE and very Substance to DEPEND <HI>on the Minister</HI>'s AUTHORITIE <HI>and</HI> CALLING; or else THEIRS which <HI>def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, disannull,</HI> and <HI>annihilate</HI> both, in respect of that one onely <HI>personall Defect;</HI> there being not any Law of God, which saith, that if the Minister bee incompetent [thro' want of Calling] his Word shall be <HI>no</HI> Word, his Baptisme <HI>no</HI> Baptisme?</Q> — He adds (speaking of the <HI>Sepa∣ratists</HI>) <Q>Such are their FUMBLING SHIFTS to inclose the <HI>Minister</HI>'s VOCATION within the Compasse of some <HI>essential</HI> Part of the Sacrament. A Thing that CAN NEVER STAND with <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>sincere</HI> Construction.— The Fruit of Baptisme dependeth onely on the Covenant which God hath made,</Q> &amp;c. I cou'd gladly take the Pains to copy over much more: but this must suffice. And now I put it to all impartial Readers to say, WHO it is, that in the Judgment of admired HOOKER <HI>"runs into the Error of the Separatists"</HI> in the point of NUL∣LITY, <HI>Elutherius,</HI> or <HI>Eusebius!</HI> And in Charity to <HI>Eusebius,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="003651_0086_1002024C2B0D1288"/>I once more beseech him to read and study the <HI>Ecclesiastical Polity;</HI> not doubting but he will find very much there, to the Confusion of his darling Scheme, and to the Reproach of his late <HI>unaccountable</HI> Separation.</P>
<P>I take Leave now to recommend to him another of his own applauded Authors, I mean <HI>Bp.</HI> HOADLY. Pray, let <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> consult this learned <HI>Prelate</HI>'s Book before mention'd; his famous PRESERVATIVE <HI>against the Principles and Practices of the</HI> NONJURORS <HI>both in Church and State:</HI> and if he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> meet with nothing there to confound his Schismatical Scheme, and justify <HI>Independent Principles,</HI> I will undertake to cite E∣nough for the Purpose, when call'd upon: For I doubt not, a very Stripling may do somewhat in this Cause, like <HI>David's</HI> cutting off the insulting <HI>Philistine's</HI> head with his <HI>own Sword.</HI> In the Interim, will he be pleas'd to accept of a few select Passages, which may suffice for the present! And let him try what he can make of 'em. The Bishop, in his <HI>Preface,</HI> speaking of the <HI>Subject</HI> of his following Papers (made up of three parts) says;—<Q>The <HI>Third</HI> concerns the very VITALS <HI>of true Religion;</HI> and is, in Truth, the <HI>Cause</HI> between JESUS CHRIST, and <HI>Those,</HI> who, professing them∣selves his <HI>Followers</HI> and his <HI>Ministers,</HI> substitute <HI>themselves</HI> in HIS Place, and assume the <HI>Authority</HI> of their great <HI>Legislat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and <HI>Judge.</HI>—The <HI>greatest Satisfaction</HI> I have— is, in declaring to all <HI>Christians</HI> their <HI>Right,</HI> to look into the <HI>Gospel</HI> themselves; to depend upon CHRIST alone for their <HI>Religion,</HI> and upon his <HI>final Determination</HI> alone, for their <HI>Salvation▪</HI> and, in the mean while, to esteem it <HI>a small Matter, to be judged of Man</HI>'s <HI>Judgment:</HI> Well knowing, that NOTHING but THIS <HI>wide</HI> and <HI>strong Foundation</HI> well laid, can effec∣tually guard against those <HI>Schemes,</HI> and <HI>Platforms,</HI> of a SUPERSTITIOUS TYRANNY, which may to some appear <HI>harmless</HI> at first; but from which in <HI>Truth,</HI> the whole <HI>Dreadful Fabrick</HI> of POP<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RY hath by <HI>Degrees,</HI> grown up to its full Strength and Maturity.</Q>— In the Book it self (<HI>Pag.</HI> 75, to 81.) the Bishop says; <Q>I do not love, I confess so much as to repeat the <HI>principal Branches</HI> of their <HI>beloved Scheme</HI> [i. e. of <HI>Church-Power,</HI> and <HI>Sacerdotal Privileges</HI>] They are so different (whence soever they come) from the Voice of the <HI>Gospel.</HI>— When they wou'd alarm you (as their FELLOW-LABOURERS, the <HI>Papists,</HI> do) by telling you, that you cannot hope for the <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD, but in the strictest Communion with <HI>their Church</HI> (which is the
<PB N="39" REF="003651_0086_1002024C2B0D1288"/><HI>true</HI> Church of <HI>England,</HI> governed by <HI>Bishops</HI> in a <HI>Regular Succession</HI>) that God hath himself hung your <HI>Salvation</HI> upon <HI>this Nicety;</HI> that he dispenseth none of his <HI>Favours</HI> or <HI>Graces,</HI> but by the hands of <HI>Themselves,</HI> and their subordinate <HI>Priests;</HI> that you cannot be <HI>authoritatively</HI> Blessed, or <HI>releas'd</HI> from your Sins, but by <HI>Them,</HI> who are the <HI>Regular Priests;</HI> that <HI>Churches,</HI> under <HI>other Bishops</HI> [i. e. other than those in a <HI>Regular Succession</HI>] are <HI>Schismatical Conventicles,</HI> made up of <HI>Excommunicated</HI> Persons, both <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity;</HI> out of God's Church, as well as out of his Favour: I say, when such <HI>Arguments</HI> as these are urged, you need only have Recourse to a <HI>general Answer</HI> to this whole Heap of <HI>Scan∣dal</HI> and <HI>Defamation,</HI> upon the <HI>Will</HI> of God, the <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ; and the <HI>Church,</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in particular? You may tell them securely, that you have not so understood the <HI>Nature</HI> of that <HI>God,</HI> who is your Governor and Judge; that you have not so <HI>learn't Christ,</HI> or the Design of his Gospel; or, even, the Foundation of this particular part of his Church, reform'd and establish'd in <HI>England.</HI> The following <HI>Arguments</HI> will justify you: which therefore ought to be frequently in the Thoughts of <HI>All,</HI> who have any Value for the most important Points.</Q></P>
<Q><P><HI>God</HI> is just, and equal, and good: and, as sure as He is so, He cannot put the Salvation and Happiness of <HI>any Man,</HI> upon what He himself hath put it out of the Power of <HI>any Man</HI> upon Earth, to be intirely satisfied in.</P>
<P>It hath not pleased God, in his <HI>Providence,</HI> to keep up any Proof of the <HI>least Probability,</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> POSSIBILITY, of a <HI>Regular Uninterrupted Succession.</HI> But there is a great Appear∣ance, and humanely speaking, a <HI>Certainty</HI> of the Contrary; that this <HI>Succession</HI> hath been often <HI>interrupted:</HI> especially in the Opinion of THOSE, who maintain all <HI>Lay-Baptisms,</HI> and all Offices performed by Persons, that either have been <HI>irregularly ordained,</HI> or have <HI>forged</HI> their Pretensions to Ordi∣nation, to be more NULLITIES: there having been cer∣tainly a <HI>great Number</HI> of such like Instances.</P>
<P>Amongst <HI>our selves</HI> particularly, the <HI>Case</HI> will admit of another <HI>Argument;</HI>—It is very well known that, ever since the <HI>Reformation,</HI> there hath been a Regular <HI>Succession</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> kept up, certainly in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and probably in <HI>England</HI> also, by the Church of ROME.—It is as well known, that several of the first <HI>Protestant Bishops</HI> were named by the <HI>Lay-Power,</HI> as <HI>Successors</HI> to <HI>Bishops,</HI> who were deprived solely
<PB N="40" REF="003651_0087_10023C65878ED850"/>by that <HI>Lay-Power.</HI> Nor can there be any <HI>Regular Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ssion</HI> in the <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> but what must come down from <HI>those</HI> Bishops; whom yet our <HI>Adversaries</HI> must <HI>deny</HI> to have been <HI>Bishops,</HI> upon the Account of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>Lay Deprivations.</HI></P>
<P>Ask our <HI>Adversaries</HI> therefore, first, What shou'd we have done, upon <HI>their</HI> Principles, for any Degree of <HI>Reformation?</HI> — To have it from any <HI>Hands</HI> but theirs [the <HI>Popish</HI> Bi∣shops and Clergy] will, I fear, upon <HI>their</HI> [High Church] Principles, give a <HI>Nullity</HI> to the whole: As this cannot be done, without setting up <HI>Altar</HI> against <HI>Altar,</HI> and one <HI>Suc∣cession</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> against <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>Ask them, how we shall decide the Matter (not between <HI>our selves</HI> and <HI>them,</HI> but) between their MUCH DEARER Friends, the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> — I have never heard yet, that this <HI>present Popish</HI> Church, in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> hath been condemn'd by our <HI>Adversaries,</HI> as NO <HI>Church,</HI> and all its <HI>Ordinances</HI> declared NULL; and its <HI>Suc∣cession,</HI> irregular or insignificant. And yet, upon <HI>their</HI> Prin∣ciples, if the Appointment of <HI>Romish Bishops</HI> here be <HI>Regular;</HI> there cannot be <HI>Another,</HI> in <HI>Opposition</HI> to it, <HI>Regular</HI> like∣wise. If the <HI>Popish</HI> Church here, be a <HI>Church;</HI> then, these new Protestant <HI>Churches</HI> cannot be truly so, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Advocates</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> therefore, are so wise, as to turn these Principles of some <HI>profess'd Protestants</HI> to their own Account; and delude many weak Minds, of such as have been first deluded by our <HI>Nonjurors.</HI>—All this may, methinks (as he goes on, <HI>p.</HI> 87, 88.) serve to alarm our <HI>Ad∣versaries,</HI> upon <HI>their own Principles,</HI> about the Danger, <HI>their own Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is in, by <HI>their way of Proceeding.</HI> And perhaps <HI>They,</HI> who seem to have but a very <HI>faint Notion</HI> of the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> any farther than they suppose them to go, hand in hand, with <HI>their own</HI> particular <HI>Sect,</HI> and Church, may receive the first. Impression and Suspicion of <HI>their</HI> being <HI>mistaken,</HI> from this manifest <HI>Tendency</HI> of their <HI>own</HI> Principles, to <HI>unchurch</HI> Them∣selves; and to reflect back upon their own <HI>People</HI> and <HI>Clergy,</HI> that <HI>Excommunication</HI> and <HI>Damnation,</HI> which they are so freely dispensing abroad, all around them.</P>
<P>And as I am sure (says he, <HI>p.</HI> 98.) that it is <HI>upright</HI> and <HI>honest,</HI> to speak thus plainly; and to inculcate this upon <HI>You:</HI> So I am as sure, it is the only certain Method of preventing, or expelling the POISON of <HI>Those,</HI> who are <HI>gone out from us, because they were not of us.</HI></P></Q>

Thus the very Bishop, that <HI>Eusebius</HI> just now made his <HI>Ap¦peal</HI> to, has turn'd all his own Artillery against him and his Party: and verily they had need have Backs of Steel, as well as Faces of Brass, to bear such a scourge, and stand it out after so severe a whipping. The Bishop, you see, has laid down <HI>Premises,</HI> and drawn <HI>Conclusions,</HI> which <HI>strike</HI> as <HI>high,</HI> and as deep too, as that hated Passage of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s; at which this Gentleman started, &amp; made the fearful Exclamation, "<HI>Eluthe∣rius</HI> will UNDO US ALL." I may surely return him his own words (<HI>p.</HI> 27.) and let him see how he likes them, coming from <HI>my</HI> hand: <Q><HI>You have</HI> NULL'D <HI>all</HI> LAY-<HI>Ordinations, and such as</HI> DERIVE <HI>from them; and pray look into that Affair a little critically, and see if this be not your</HI> OWN <HI>Case.— You see what must be your own Fate;</HI></Q> upon submitting the present Dispute to the Decision of your chosen Episcopal Umpire. Well, I commit <HI>Eusebius</HI> to the Mercy of the BISHOP: and if he thinks, that HIS <HI>tender Mercies are cruel,</HI> let him blame himself for so ill-judg'd an Appeal; in which his intemperate Zeal certainly outran his Wit.</P>
<P>In the Language of this celebrated <HI>Bishop</HI> (who, I must observe by the way, seems to have alter'd his Judgment in these Ecclesiastical matters, since he manag'd his Controversy with Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> against the Dissenters) I go on, and under his Authority, I venture to accuse <HI>Eusebius</HI> and his Party, <Q>Not merely of a <HI>Heresy</HI> against <HI>Charity,</HI> as they do the DONA∣TISTS, who had only just the SAME <HI>Uncharitableness,</HI> of adhe∣ring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Consequences of their own Principles; But, of a <HI>Heresy</HI> even against the very <HI>Possibility,</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of Things; or of holding that, which throws Men out of the Favour of God, which way soever they act.</Q> But I must resign these anomalous Episcopalians to the <HI>Bishop</HI> himself, for the <HI>making out</HI> this Accusation; which he does at large, in too many Pages to be here recited. (See PRESERV. <HI>p.</HI> 89, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this Part of <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Argument; because if he be spoil'd of the <HI>main</HI> piece of his Armour, we may safely leave him to work all his other Engines, as he pleaseth.</P>
<P>I might fairly now withdraw my hand from the Table, and venture the Rest of our Author's Dialogue, with his Friend's Letters annex'd, to try their Fortune. For, after what has been now offer'd, let them advance a thousand specious <HI>Pretences</HI> for the immutable <HI>Divine Right</HI> and absolute perpetual <HI>Necessity</HI> of the supreme Order of <HI>Bishops;</HI> let them quote what <HI>Precedents,</HI> and
<PB N="42" REF="003651_0088_10023C9C01A7DFB8"/><HI>Testimonies,</HI> they please, of Men after the <HI>Apostles,</HI> tho' never so <HI>pious,</HI> or great; and let 'em bring what consequential Ar∣guings, they will, from the Example of the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves: their own Bishop HOADLY (<HI>Preserv.</HI> p. 93.) has taught us to say to our Readers, <HI>If they amuse you with that</HI> POWER, <HI>which our Saviour lodg'd with his</HI> APOSTLES, <HI>You may answer securely, That it is impossible for</HI> you <HI>to depend upon</HI> THIS <HI>Right, in</HI> THEM, <HI>as any thing</HI> Certain, <HI>till they prove to you, that Every Thing spoken to the</HI> Apostles, <HI>belongs to</HI> Bishops <HI>in all Ages of the</HI> Church. <Q>It is therefore (says he, <HI>p.</HI> 101.) your <HI>Duty,</HI> your <HI>Pri∣vilege,</HI> and your <HI>Interest,</HI> to observe <HI>Those</HI> Passages in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> in which the <HI>Genius,</HI> and <HI>great Design,</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> is <HI>purposely</HI> express'd; and <HI>Those</HI> in which it is <HI>pur∣posely</HI> and expresly declared, upon <HI>what Sort</HI> of Things <HI>Christ</HI> will acquit, or condemn You, at the last Day. — These will be your safe and unmoveable <HI>Retreat.</HI> And whilst you adhere to <HI>Them,</HI> you will ever be sure, that not the least <HI>Tittle</HI> of your Salvation, or Damnation, depends upon the <HI>Will</HI> of weak <HI>Men;</HI> but <HI>all</HI> upon <HI>God</HI> and <HI>your selves:</HI> that <HI>Human Benedictions, Human Absolutions, Human De∣nunciations, Human Excommunications,</HI> have nothing to do with the <HI>Favour</HI> or <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD. — Therefore, <HI>Stand fast in that</HI> LIBERTY, <HI>with which</HI> God and Christ <HI>have made you free.</HI></Q> I shall here borrow but one Word more from the Bishop (<HI>p.</HI> 86.) <Q>Let this be apply'd to all LIKE <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses;</HI> and it will be a CERTAIN <HI>Rule</HI> to go by.</Q> So I leave <HI>Eusebius</HI> to wrangle it out with his <HI>Right Rev.</HI> FATHER, on the present Argument: and pass on to the remaining Parts of the <HI>Dialogue</HI> before us</P>
<P>But having so enlarg'd on what has first offer'd, I am oblig'd to make short Work with the Rest▪ I had taken the Pains indeed to go thro' the whole, with particular and large Re∣marks on such Passages, as at first appear'd to me not <HI>coincident</HI> with any Thing in the <HI>other Gentleman</HI>'s Answer, call'd, <HI>The Scripture-Bishop Examin'd:</HI> But upon a Review of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s VINDICATION, now come from the Press, I find <HI>that</HI> Part of my Performance very much superseded; and his <HI>Vin∣dication</HI> will, in most Things that remain, serve for a suffici∣ent Reply, as well to his new Adversary; being easily applica∣ble, by every intelligent Reader to that End.

<P><PB N="43" REF="003651_0088_10023C9C01A7DFB8"/>
<HI>Sect.</HI> X. For the Case of <HI>Timo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI>'s Ordination by the <HI>Laying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the hands of the Presbytery,</HI> which Eusebius brings under Consideration (<HI>pag.</HI> 27.) I refer you to the <HI>Vindication;</HI> where you'l find all the Reply, that needs to be made. See VINDI∣CATION, <HI>pag.</HI> 70, to 76,— Only upon Occasion of a Passage <HI>Eusebius</HI> has (in <HI>pag.</HI> 30.) I will just offer one Request to him; which is, That he wou'd please to adjust the affair of <HI>Presbyters</HI> joyning with the Prelate in <HI>Ordination,</HI> a little more exactly, and inform us precisely what is the Nature of that ASSIST∣ANCE, he says, they give him in <HI>Ordaining.</HI> For not a little may depend upon the true stating of that critical Point.</P>
<P>So for the Case of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI>'s Separation by the Laying on of the hands of certain Prophets and Teachers, which <HI>Eusebius</HI> brings next into Debate (<HI>p.</HI> 32.) You will find the specious Flourishes here intirely spoil'd, if you look into <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s VINDICATION, where he has given a full Answer to the Question, "<HI>What were they ordain'd</HI> to"? and a Solution to the pretended <HI>"Self-Contradiction."</HI> See VINDI∣CATION, <HI>pag.</HI> 76, to 80. — Only, because <HI>Eusebius</HI> denies that this was indeed any <HI>Ordination</HI> at all, I will just give him the Hint, That in this he contradicts some of the <HI>Fathers;</HI> St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> for instance, who asserts, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Antioch</HI> ORDAINED to the APOSTLESHIP, and that this is the sense of <HI>Acts</HI> 13. And he as well contradicts Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> Dr. <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> and others. Mr. <HI>Ollyffe,</HI> in his Controversy with Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> pleads this Text in favour of <HI>Reordination:</HI> which I wonder <HI>Eusebius</HI> for his own sake shou'd forget.— Bishop <HI>Taylor</HI> (in his <HI>Clerus Domini,</HI> p. 54.) speaking of <HI>Paul,</HI> says, <Q>He had the special Honour to be <HI>chosen</HI> in an Extraordinary Way: yet he also had something of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> too; for in an <HI>extraordinary manner</HI> he was sent to be ORDAINED in an <HI>ordinary Ministery.</HI>— His <HI>Designation</HI> was as <HI>immediate,</HI> as that of the eleven Apostles, though his ORDINATION was not. — <HI>Saul</HI> upon his ORDINATION changed his Name, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> He is first called <HI>Paul,</HI> Act. 13.9.— Let me add, I wou'd fain have <HI>Eusebius</HI> give us one single Reason, why <HI>Paul</HI> might not be properly <HI>ordain'd,</HI> as well as <HI>Timothy;</HI> if he supposes there was no <HI>essential Difference</HI> between them: and if <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordain'd by the Laying on of the hands of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> why not as well <HI>any other</HI> of the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Order, by the same hands? But whether he'll allow it to be a proper <HI>Ordination,</HI> in his peculiar Sense of the matter, or no; Here's certainly a <HI>Precedent</HI> for all that <HI>we</HI> mean by <HI>Ordina∣tion.</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="003651_0089_10023CA8F3E2C6A0"/>Here's an Instance of acknowledg'd Presbyters <HI>separat∣ing</HI> Persons to the work of the Ministry, and <HI>sending them forth.</HI> Now had our Adversaries as plain and evident a Scriptural Instance of an undisputed <HI>Prelate's Separating</HI> an <HI>Apostle</HI> in the like Case, very probably they wou'd have triumph'd in it, as an incontestible <HI>standing Precedent</HI> for Episcopal Ordination. In the <HI>Consecration of Bishops,</HI> this Fact is alledg'd as an <HI>Example</HI> (but how pertinently!) which shews the Sense of the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XI. In the next place, we are entertain'd with a Debate upon the <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as infer'd from the <HI>promif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous</HI> Use of the Words; (<HI>Pag.</HI> 34, to 38.) But the Cavils and Objections here offer'd by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> were sufficiently obviated in <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Dialogue; or if not, they are now fully answered, in his Defence of it. See VINDI∣CATION, <HI>pag.</HI> 65, to 70. And <HI>pag.</HI> 91—93.</P>
<P>However, by the way, I will offer a Request to <HI>Eusebius:</HI> Whereas he observes (<HI>p.</HI> 34.) <Q><HI>The word</HI> Bishop <HI>has for more than</HI> 1600 <HI>years been us'd in a</HI> more <HI>restrained Sense, than in the New Testament;</HI></Q> I beg he wou'd please to inform us of the exact <HI>Date</HI> of this Restriction, and the precise <HI>Degree</HI> of it. For a clear Decision of these <HI>two Cases</HI> is absolutely necessary to the support of his Cause; Because too <HI>late</HI> a Restraint, or a Restraint only of the <HI>Name,</HI> or of a little of the <HI>Power,</HI> won't suffice for the Foundation of a Disparity of <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>And I observe, whereas he tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 35.) <Q><HI>At first —the Imparity was sufficiently distinguish'd, by the superior Order's being call'd by a Name appropriate thereto,</HI> viz. Apostle, <HI>which never was us'd in Common, as the other Names were;</HI></Q> Nevertheless (I say) the Distinction is <HI>not</HI> sufficiently signify'd, if this Name <HI>Apostle</HI> was <HI>never</HI> given, in the appropriate Sense of the word, to <HI>some</HI> that he supposes to be of that superior Order. The Occasion of my mentioning this is, It's remarkable, that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Timothy,</HI> joyning together in several Epistles, <HI>Paul</HI> in the Superscription assumes to himself the style of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> but leaves out <HI>Timothy</HI>'s apostolical Character. Now, I pray the Reason. Must we not fetch it from that Scripture, <HI>Are all Apostles? Are all Evangelists?</HI>— I add, Neither was the Imparity sufficiently distinguish'd, altho' the name <HI>Apostle</HI> might never be us'd in Common; BECAUSE the Word <HI>Evan∣gelist</HI> was certainly us'd <HI>as little</HI> in Common; and yet our Adversaries plead, that <HI>Evangelists</HI> were not a <HI>distinct Order.</HI> Much less will it appear, that the Imparity was sufficient∣ly
<PB N="45" REF="003651_0089_10023CA8F3E2C6A0"/>notify'd, if the Name <HI>Apostle</HI> was sometimes apply'd in a <HI>common</HI> Sense, to such as it does not appear were of that superior Order he speaks of, I mean of the same Class with the <HI>Twelve.</HI> If <HI>Silas</HI> be any where honour'd with the Title of <HI>Apostle,</HI> it must be meant only in a <HI>common</HI> Sense: for we read, he was only one of the <HI>chief Men among the Brethren,</HI> and distinguish'd from <HI>the Apostles,</HI> when this Appellation is us'd in its appropri∣ate Sense, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.22.—If <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> or <HI>Titus</HI> are call'd <HI>Apostles,</HI> 'tis only as they were Messengers of the Churches. And if <HI>Timothy</HI> was an Apostle, I demand that <HI>Eusebius</HI> shew us in him <HI>the Signs of an Apostle.</HI>—In fine, I observe We are not sufficiently inform'd, That what <HI>Superiority</HI> or In∣fluence the Apostles, <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; the <HI>Twelve,</HI> appear to have had over Pastors and Churches, was the Result strictly of their <HI>Commission-Power,</HI> and not rather of some peculiar <HI>inspired Gifts,</HI> which gave them a Preheminence. So that their <HI>Example</HI> is not sufficient to establish the Doctrine of a <HI>standing,</HI> Imparity. And then supposing a perpetual Imparity admitted, what must it be? An Imparity of <HI>Order,</HI> or of <HI>Degree</HI> only? It's obser∣vable, Mr. HOOKER (<HI>Pol.</HI> p 417.) says, <Q>The whole Bodie of the Church being divided into <HI>Laitie</HI> and <HI>Cleargie,</HI> the Clear∣gie are either <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Deacons.</HI></Q> So again (p. 421.) <Q>All whom the Church did ordain, were either to serve as <HI>Presbyters</HI> or as <HI>Deacons.</HI></Q> Tho' he is of Opinion (as he expresses it, <HI>p.</HI> 419.) <Q>Of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> some were <HI>greater,</HI> some <HI>lesse</HI> in power, and that by our Saviour's own Appointment.</Q> He makes <Q>the <HI>Apostles</HI> peculiar Charge to be <HI>this,</HI> to publish the Gospell of Christ unto <HI>all Nations,</HI> &amp; to <HI>deliver</HI> them his Or∣dinances received by <HI>immediate Revelation from Himselfe.</HI> Which Preeminence excepted (says he) to all other Offices and Duties incident into their Order, it was in them to ordaine and consecrate whomsoever they thought meete</Q> &amp;c. He tells us (p. 421.) <Q><HI>Evangelists</HI> were <HI>Presbyters</HI> of principall Suffi∣ciencie, whom the Apostles sent abroad, and used as Agents in Ecclesiastical Affairs, wheresoever they saw need. <HI>Ana∣nias, Apollos,</HI> TIMOTHY were <HI>thus</HI> imployed.— Finally, <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> what other were they than <HI>Presbyters</HI> also? Howbeit <HI>setled</HI> in some <HI>certaine Charge,</HI> and <HI>thereby</HI> differing from <HI>Evangelists.</HI></Q> And he uses that peculiar Phrase else-where (<HI>p.</HI> 436.) "<HI>Bishops,</HI>—and OTHER <HI>Presbyters.</HI>" So that, upon the whole, it is plain, Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> makes them all <HI>radically</HI> and essentially <HI>one Order;</HI> not different <HI>Species</HI> of Ministers, having <HI>essentially diverse</HI> Rights, Powers and Businesses,
<PB N="46" REF="003651_0090_10023C73A0653680"/>but fundamentally one and the same Order of Ministers; tho' with some. Variation as to <HI>Degrees,</HI> and <HI>Ways</HI> of exercising their <HI>common</HI> Rights and Powers, yet this merely for <HI>Order</HI>'s sake. The Distinction between Bishops and other <HI>Presbyters,</HI> he calls it a <HI>"Difference of Pastors":</HI> and only supposes <Q><HI>It ought to be, when they grow to any great Multitude,</HI></Q> (p. 125. which implies, that this <HI>Difference of Pastors</HI> is not absolute∣ly, in all Cases, necessary. And he has these remarkable words (<HI>p.</HI> 124) <Q>Where the <HI>Clergy</HI> are any <HI>great Multitude,</HI> ORDER doth necessarily require that by DEGREES they be <HI>distinguished.</HI></Q>— Now a mere <HI>gradual</HI> Difference, in such a Case, between Ministers for <HI>Order</HI>'s sake, perhaps few <HI>Non∣conformists</HI> wou'd oppose; and it's certain, the Body of 'em express'd their Consent to this, when they offer'd to admit <HI>And bishop</HI> USHER'S <HI>Reduction of Episcopacy.</HI> Upon this Occasion I'll give you the sentiments of the late learned Mr. <HI>Simon Browne</HI> (Sermon upon <HI>Ordination,</HI> p. 59.) speaking of <HI>Titus,</HI> he says, <Q><HI>General</HI> Work was his <HI>principal</HI> Work; not as an Officer <HI>essentially</HI> different from other Presbyters, but as an <HI>It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rant</HI> Minister &amp;c.— And if such a <HI>general</HI> Officer were still employ'd in <HI>Ordinations,</HI> and his Work esteem'd more honorable than that of <HI>fix'd</HI> Pastors, and he in <HI>that Sense</HI> superior to 'em, whilst their <HI>Original</HI> Power of ordain∣ing, when chosen out to this Service, were acknowledg'd, I know None that wou'd so far run counter to <HI>Apostolical Practice,</HI> as to quarrel with this Office.</Q>— I add; So much wou'd be consented to, by the Generality of Noncon∣formists, I believe, for Peace-sake at least: altho' we do not hold a <HI>Superiority</HI> in some Ministers over others to be of standing Obligation by any Divine <HI>Institution;</HI> nor indeed do we see the <HI>same Necessity</HI> of it <HI>now,</HI> as there might be in the <HI>Infancy</HI> of the Church; much less of a Superiority in the nature and degree of that <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> the <HI>Reasons</HI> whereof ceased with their Persons, and which therefore must be acknowledg'd purely <HI>temporary.</HI> A Priority of Order may be allow'd: but a Primacy of Sovereignty we look upon as an intolerable Usurpation.</P>
<P><HI>Eus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bius</HI> has another remarkable Passage (<HI>p.</HI> 36.) <Q><HI>We have no Reason</HI> (says he) <HI>to complain for want of a clear and plain Dispersation in all necessary points of Fath and Practice: — and especially in this matter</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Now here's (1) a <HI>Concession</HI> to the Fulness and Perspicuity of Scripture, that su∣persedes the Necessity of <HI>traditional</HI> Light, in matters funda∣mental;
<PB N="47" REF="003651_0090_10023C73A0653680"/>which confounds the great Argument of the two <HI>Letters</HI> annex'd. (2) Here's an <HI>Implication,</HI> that <HI>Episcopacy</HI> is one of those <HI>fundamental</HI> matters; in which he contradicts all his own Authors. (3) Here's an <HI>Assertion,</HI> that in this matter the Truth <HI>is sufficiently clear</HI> from the Scripture; which is confuted by the long Controversy about Episcopacy, between learned and good Men on both sides— But he adds a qua∣lifying Proviso, to compleat the Farce: <HI>"If Men will open their Eyes."</HI> He had e'en as good have said, If Men wou'd but see with <HI>his</HI> Eyes. But then He must lend us his Glasses to help our Sight: Yet alas, such is our Misfortune, all Men can't see thro' the same Spectacles.— To his Question <HI>(Ibid.)</HI> <Q><HI>Seeing there was then a superior Order,</HI> viz. <HI>Apostles, why might not the Church afterwards appropriate the Word— Bishop— to that Order</HI></Q> &amp;c I answer
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) They <HI>might not do</HI> it, because afterwards there was in fact <HI>no</HI> superior Order, to appropriate it to. If he says, there was, I must observe, 'tis <HI>gratis dictum,</HI> he has not yet <HI>prov'd</HI> it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) They <HI>need not</HI> do it,— upon the <HI>Reason,</HI> he assigns.</ITEM>
</LIST>
For I argue; <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> had those CRITERIONS of <HI>Apostles,</HI> which he mentions (viz. <Q><HI>immediate Mission, and</HI> other <HI>Things peculiar to their Persons,</HI></Q>) or they had not. If <HI>not,</HI> then how do's he prove <HI>Them</HI> to be of the supreme Order? (For will he not grant, that <HI>immediate Mis∣sion</HI> was an essential stroke in the Character of an <HI>Apostle!</HI>) But if he says they had, the Fact remains to be prov'd; nor will it afford any Consequence to his Purpose. I add, It seems strange to suppose, there shou'd be need of <HI>distinguishing the first Planters,</HI> when they were <HI>dead,</HI> and not when alive.— It seems strange, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and others, shou'd be call'd <HI>Apostles,</HI> while the <HI>Twelve</HI> were living, and yet after∣wards (as they must do, by his way of representing the matter) <HI>lose</HI> that honorable Name, the <HI>sole</HI> Name appropriate to the superior Order, and sink down to a Name (that of <HI>Bishops</HI>) common to the <HI>inferior</HI> Order — <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Observation (<HI>p.</HI> 37.) upon <HI>Act.</HI> 1.20. is very frivolous and weak; since he allows the Word <HI>Bishop</HI> to be us'd at first in Common. And then, at the <HI>same time</HI> the Apostolick Office, it's observable, was call'd <HI>Diaconia,</HI> ver. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—To put any Colour on his Argu∣ment here, he must first prove, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> in Reality had their <Q><HI>Successors, in the chief Government of the Church in its settled State;</HI></Q> we shan't quarrel with him about the <HI>Name,</HI> if he proves the <HI>Thing</HI>— The <HI>Fathers</HI> using the Name <HI>Bishop</HI> in a sense distinct from that of Presbyter, will never
<PB N="48" REF="003651_0091_10023C58F7431458"/>prove a superiority of <HI>Order;</HI> much less such a superiority <HI>Jure Divino.</HI>—Further, as to what he observes on the Word <HI>Im∣perator</HI> (ibid.) it's obvious, that he has here very much misrepresented <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Design in his <HI>Dialogue,</HI> p. 14. The Scope of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s <HI>Argument</HI> there was to prove, that <HI>this Example</HI> is not a <HI>Parallel</HI> to the Case under Consideration. For to make it so, it ought to have had in it <HI>two</HI> Terms, <HI>General</HI> and <HI>Monarch,</HI> apply'd promiscuously to two <HI>distinct Officers</HI> at the same time. Whereas, says <HI>Elutherius</HI> (ibid.) <Q>There never was, nor cou'd be, without the Confusion of Lan∣guage, a promiscuous Use of <HI>Monarch</HI> and <HI>General,</HI> AS we find there was of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter.</HI></Q>—And then, in this Case of the <HI>single</HI> Name (<HI>Imperator,</HI> or Commander) tho' suppos'd to be <HI>at the same time</HI> promiscuously given to a <HI>General</HI> and a <HI>Monarch,</HI> there might be an easy Distinction of them notwithstanding, by reason of the two <HI>different Species</HI> of Government and Business, <HI>Military</HI> and <HI>Civil:</HI> Whereas in the Case of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> the sort of <HI>Government,</HI> as to both, is <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> and indeed their <HI>whole Work</HI> the same; which is what <HI>Elutherius</HI> in his Dialogue proceeds to prove by several Scripture-Arguments. — So that <HI>Eusebius</HI> certainly cou'd have little Temptation to glory in so small a Criticism, as he has offer'd: and I think rather it's <HI>his</HI> Answer that appears <HI>"Shuffling and impertinent."</HI>—In a following Passage, he gives me Occasion to renew my Demand of the exact <HI>Date</HI> abovementioned: Else if we shou'd multiply Instances to our Purpose without Number, whether out of Scripture or Antiquity, he wou'd still shuffle us off with that trifling Reply, <HI>"Your Instances are all more ancient."</HI> Pray let him tell us what Century, and what Part of that Century, we must fix upon. One would think, such an <HI>important Fact,</HI> as that of <HI>appropriating a Name,</HI> which had long been apply'd in Common, especially if it was <HI>universal</HI> matter of Fact, done by publick agreement, must needs have some famous <HI>Witnesses</HI> to it in History (according to the Episcopal way of reasoning) from whence the precise <HI>Year and Day</HI> of the re∣markable Event might easily be collected. I wish to see a fair Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XII. In the next place (<HI>p.</HI> 39.) <HI>Eusebius</HI> taxes <HI>Eluthe∣rius</HI>'s Dialogue of a <HI>"false Representation,"</HI> with respect to <Q>the SOLE <HI>Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction united in the Bishop</HI></Q> &amp;c. Now it were enough, for Answer, to refer him
<PB N="49" REF="003651_0091_10023C58F7431458"/>to the <HI>Letters</HI> our Author himself has publish'd, which make the <HI>very same</HI> Representation. See <HI>Page</HI> 100. where the <HI>governing Powers</HI> and the <HI>Power of Ordination</HI> are put on the <HI>same Foot</HI> without any Distinction; and <HI>governing</HI> Powers are appropri∣ated to the Bishop, in <HI>Exclusion</HI> of all <HI>Partners.</HI> But I will refer him to a greater Authority; I mean Bishop <HI>Bilson,</HI> who in his <HI>Perpetual Government of Christ</HI>'s <HI>Church</HI> (p. 317.) speaks more fully to <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Purpose; expresly denying <HI>Presbyters</HI> <Q>the publick Use of the Keys, and affirming, that <HI>this</HI> the Church of Christ allowed always, and ONLY, to Bishops.</Q> For a further Refutation of <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Distinction of <HI>subordinate</HI> and <HI>chief</HI> Governments, I refer to the well-known Case of Mr. <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.— Elutherius</HI> certainly <HI>stated the matter right;</HI> and this Gentleman has offered nothing but a <HI>fanciful Distinction,</HI> without any Authority to support it: so his <HI>Charge</HI> of Mis∣representation, by force of its own Weight falls to the Ground, but rebounds on himself.</P>
<P>Next follows a Dispute about <HI>who are Successors to the Apostles,</HI> p. 40; to 44. And here <HI>Eusebius</HI> has expos'd himself by a Com∣plication of unhappy <HI>Blunders,</HI> as they appear to me, whereby he has in effect overthrown his whole Cause; which might easily be shewn, but that I am not willing to swell these Papers to a needless Length. For I think <HI>Elutherius</HI> has said E∣nough in Answer to what is offer'd here by way of Argument, in his VINDICATION. <HI>p.</HI> 91 to 103. However I will present <HI>Eusebius</HI> with some borrow'd Scraps, from Episcopal Hands, for him to chew upon. The first is a Saying of the excellent Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> I have met with somewhere in his Book of <HI>the Religion of Protestants.</HI> <Q>The <HI>Apostles</HI> (says he) by laying the Foundations of the Church, were to be the <HI>Foundations</HI> of it: and accordingly are so called in Scrip∣ture. And <HI>therefore,</HI> as in a Building it is <HI>incongruous</HI> that Foundations shou'd <HI>succeed</HI> Foundations; so it may be in the Church, that any <HI>other</HI> Apostles shou'd succeed the FIRST.</Q> — To which I shall add that of pious Bishop HALL (<HI>Works</HI> p. 331.) <Q>These Tooles which serve for the <HI>Foun∣dation,</HI> are not of use for the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> Yea, the great Master-Builder chose those workmen for the <HI>first Stones,</HI> which he <HI>meant not</HI> to imploy in the <HI>Walls.</HI> Do we not see <HI>all</HI> Christ's first Agents EXTRAORDINARY; <HI>Apostles, Evangelists</HI> &amp;c. — What Church ever since boasted of such <HI>Founders?</HI> — Why shou'd God <HI>begin</HI> with those He meant <HI>not to continue;</HI> but to shew us we may not always looke for one
<PB N="50" REF="003651_0092_10023C680CE963B0"/>Face of Things?</Q> — So again (pag. 552.) <Q>We may not either have or expect now in the Church <HI>that Ministery,</HI> which Christ set: <HI>Where</HI> are our <HI>Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists?</HI> If we must always looke for the <HI>very same Administration</HI> of the Church, which our Saviour <HI>left,</HI> why doe we not challenge those <HI>extraordinary Functions?</HI> Doe we not rather thinke, since it pleased him to <HI>begin</HI> with those Offices which shou'd <HI>not continue,</HI> that herein he purposely intended to <HI>teach</HI> us, That if we have the same heavenly <HI>Business done,</HI> we shou'd not be <HI>too curious</HI> in the Circum∣stances of the <HI>Persons?</HI></Q> — I now leave <HI>Eusebius</HI> to contest the Point with Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> and Mr <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> whether there was any proper <HI>Succession</HI> to the <HI>Apostolick Office.</HI> Let him laugh now, if he pleases, at <Q><HI>the Apostles double Capacity, which help'd</HI> those great Authors to such <HI>fine Distinctions:</HI> and let him <HI>vapour</HI> over the Bishop's <HI>Conclusion,</HI></Q> as he has done (<HI>p.</HI> 30.) over that of <HI>Elutherius, "being both equally ridiculous,"</HI> and to pass in <HI>his</HI> Account, no doubt, for <HI>"mere Whims of their own Brain."</HI> I shall now add a word or two by way of <HI>Request.</HI> I desire this Gentleman to inform me, Whether the <HI>Apostles</HI> Superintendency did not extend over <HI>all Churches,</HI> and over <HI>Bishops,</HI> as well as Presbyters? And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> they be that are their Successors in this <HI>universal</HI> Superinten∣dency? Or was this an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Power, not design'd for Continuance? I desire he will be punctual in answering me to this: for if he says, The <HI>Apostles</HI> Superintendency, as <HI>universally</HI> exercis'd, was <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and limited to their Persons, I wou'd fain have my Turn to laugh at a <HI>fine Distincti∣on,</HI> that will ruin his Cause; Or if he chooses to say, without any Distinction, That their universal Superintendency was an <HI>ordinary</HI> and continuing Power, I shall still have the Pleasure of seeing him confound his own Scheme, by setting up a <HI>fourth</HI> Officer in the Church, <HI>Paramount</HI> to the other Three, which can be nothing inferior to a POPE.— Another <HI>Request</HI> I have to make, is this: If Apostolical <HI>Superintendency</HI> be the sole Prerogative of <HI>Bishops,</HI> and such as necessarily bespeaks them a distinct and superior Order in the Church, then I beg <HI>Eusebius,</HI> who is such a mighty Solver of Difficulties, and yet such a Hater of fine Distinctions, to inform me, How we may reconcile the <HI>Practice</HI> of his <HI>own Church</HI> with this <HI>Scheme.</HI> Pray, Sir, be so good as to tell me what <HI>sacred</HI> Order your <HI>Lay-Chancellors</HI> belong to; who, tho' it may be pretended they hold their spiritual Courts in the Name of the Bishop,
<PB N="51" REF="003651_0092_10023C680CE963B0"/>yet do receive their Commission from the King, and act <HI>without the Bishop,</HI> and can bid <HI>Defiance</HI> to him upon Occasion. Bishop <HI>Bedel's</HI> Case for that.— And then, pray let me know, whether those <HI>Deans</HI> are Apostolical Superintendents; who, especi∣ally in the <HI>Peculiars,</HI> by Law possess and exercise a separate Jurisdiction over Clergy and Laity, without the least Subor∣dination to the Bishop. Certainly, <HI>Eusebius,</HI> I may on this Occasion with a good Grace return you your own Words, (<HI>p.</HI> 43.) and say, <Q><HI>It is your Business to look out a regular Au∣thority for them, independent of the Bishops; for your All that is dear, depends upon it.</HI></Q> Assure your self, so long as the <HI>Usurpations</HI> of your <HI>Lay-Chancellors</HI> and your independent <HI>Deans</HI> are continu'd, it's a vain thing to wrangle about the Imparity of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters.</HI> Let your <HI>Episcopacy</HI> be made the same in <HI>Practice,</HI> as it is represented in Theory: Else all your artful Reasonings must pass for impertinent Paralo∣gisms, and Amusements for the Ignorant. Surely now you must on your very <HI>own</HI> Principles acknowledge, that <HI>your Pre∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> in the practical and complex Notion of it (in which it shou'd always be consider'd) as comprehending those <HI>ano∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lous Officers</HI> and a Shoal of other <HI>inferiour Usurpers</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">They that have the Curiosity to know more particularly the Names Powers and Practices of the numerous Body of <HI>English Ecclesiasticks,</HI> may consult two Pamphlets published among us: The one intitled <HI>A brief Account of the Revenues, Pomp, and State of the Bishops and other Clergy in the Church of</HI> England; printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1725. The other <HI>A brief View of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</HI>—Addressed to Sir N Cur∣zon Bar. &amp;c. London printed and Boston repr. 1733.</NOTE> who are <HI>integral</HI> parts of the Episcopal hierarchy, is at the best but a mere <HI>human Creature.</HI></P>
<P>To use your own Language (<HI>p.</HI> 41) <Q><HI>Pray contrice now how one and the same Commission cou'd make the Apostles Superinten∣dents, and their Successors</HI> (your Bishops) <HI>not Superintendents.</HI>—<HI>I don't wonder you seem puzzled.</HI></Q> Consider well before you answer: and let me beseech you to try if you can reduce the <HI>Parallel</HI> you so incomparably speculate upon (<HI>p.</HI> 43. &amp;c 44.) <HI>"to the Case before us."</HI> Pray, Sir, tell me, Does your LAY-CHANCELLOR, and do's your DEAN, <Q><HI>receive Authority to act in Christ's Name, from the Power confer'd by Christ upon the Bishop, for their Work of</HI> governing <HI>Presbyters?</HI></Q> Or do they derive their Power from human Laws and Customs?
<PB N="52" REF="003651_0093_10023CABF67471E8"/>If they receive their Commission from any but the <HI>Bishop,</HI> you may then apply to these <HI>human-Creature-Governors</HI> those Words of yours, in which <Q><HI>you design'd a Slur upon our Ordinations among your vulgar Readers,</HI></Q> as being perform'd without a Bishop, even those your Words (<HI>p.</HI> 44.) <Q><HI>Without which Power and Authority in the Bishop, the most solemn Ordinations</HI> (or Commissions, if you please, to <HI>Lay-Chancellors,</HI> &amp;c. given) <HI>by unauthorized Hands, wou'd be of no more Effect, than a for∣mal Commission signed by</HI> John of Styles <HI>appointing</HI> Tom of Nokes <HI>Justice of the Peace</HI></Q> So I cry Quittance: and dis∣miss you, to enjoy the sweet Satisfaction of your own Specula∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XIII. In the next place (<HI>p.</HI> 44 to 47.) we have a Dispute about the State of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> whether settled under a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Form of Government, or a <HI>Pre∣latical.</HI> But the Sum of what <HI>Eusebius</HI> offers here is only Conjectures and Surmises, mere <HI>"Whims of his own Brain"</HI> His Argument is, Such a Thing <HI>"might be"</HI>— <Q><HI>I see nothing that forbids;</HI></Q> Therefore it was. Truly if he takes the Liberty thus to make one Postulate after another, without any rational Grounds, and to assert what he pleases, he may e'en conclude what he lists; <HI>Quidlibet ex quolibet.</HI> There's no Bound to such a Disputant.—All that I need to do here, is to desire the Reader to turn to the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> which this Gentle∣man pretends to answer, and see whether all his rare Suppo∣sitions and strong Assertions amount to any Thing of a just Reply to <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Objections and Reasonings there. <HI>Vid.</HI> DIAL. pag. 10, 11, 12. and p. 45, to 48. — And then, if you want any further Satisfaction, look into the VINDICATI∣ON. (p. 108, <HI>to</HI> 113.) Only I must crave Leave to put a <HI>Re∣quest</HI> to the Gentleman, which is, That he wou'd inform us particularly what he <HI>means</HI> by that critical Passage (<HI>p.</HI> 47.) "Paul <HI>was himself their Bishop or Superintendent;</HI>" and shew us what <HI>Force</HI> he thinks it bears in the present Argument. It looks truly as if it were like to prove a Bone of Contention between us.</P>
<P>I pass to observe; we have next (from <HI>p.</HI> 48, to 53) a De∣bate upon that noted Text, <HI>Matth.</HI> 20.25, 26. which <HI>Eluthe∣rius</HI> in his Dialogue (<HI>p.</HI> 6, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) had urg'd, as carrying in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Prohibition of all <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Supremacy</HI> among the Mi∣nisters of the Gospel.— Now the main Thing, which <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> offers in Reply to this Argument is, That <Q><HI>if we will
<PB N="53" REF="003651_0093_10023CABF67471E8"/>but allow</HI> Bishops <HI>to have a lawful Claim to so much Authority, as the</HI> Apostles <HI>exercis'd (who it can't be suppos'd were so wicked, as to take upon themselves a forbidden Authority) he will contend for no more in their behalf as Christ</HI>'s <HI>Ministers. This,</HI> say's he, <HI>will sufficiently preserve their Supremacy</HI> &amp;c—<HI>The Bishops may keep their Mitres, and all the Authority they now enjoy in our Church.</HI></Q> Well, to cut short the Dispute, I will for once grant this Gentleman the whole of his Demand, viz. That <HI>Bishops</HI> shall have <HI>as much</HI> Authority (and <HI>no more</HI>) as the <HI>Apostles</HI> exercis'd. But then it will be a Question, <HI>What</HI> was that Authority the Apostles exercis'd? Did they exercise any <HI>Coercive</HI> Authority in matters of Religion? It seems they expresly disclaim it, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.24 — Did they exercise a <HI>Temporal</HI> Authority, a <HI>secular</HI> Dominion over their Brethren? It seems they renounce it, in saying, <HI>Our Weapons are not carnal.</HI> Did they hold Episcopal <HI>Courts,</HI> and practise such Forms of <HI>Discipline,</HI> as are in the <HI>spiritual Courts</HI> of this Age? <Q>Where, instead of the Discipline instituted by Christ, the Church-Offender is carry'd from Court to Court at intole∣rable Charges, subjected to heavy Fines, exorbitant Fees, or Imprisonment &amp;c.</Q> These Objections <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Di∣alogue had laid in this Gentleman's way: and I presume he had an Eye to these in that guarded Expression, <Q><HI>So much Au∣thority as the Apostles exercised, we will contend for no more in the Bishops behalf</HI> AS <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Ministers.</HI></Q> Now I put it to him to say, whether the Authority of the Prelacy, in those Points a∣bovemention'd, be not <HI>more</HI> than what the <HI>Apostles</HI> exercis'd; and whether such as exercise this Authority, do not do it <HI>as Christ's Ministers:</HI> and how they that <HI>as Christ</HI>'s <HI>Ministers</HI> do exercise <HI>more</HI> Authority, than the <HI>Apostles</HI> did, can be justi∣fy'd in being <HI>so wicked as to take upon themselves a forbidden Authority:</HI> For if <Q><HI>this Instruction of our Lord</HI> (in <HI>Matth.</HI> 20.) <HI>was intended</HI> (as he says) <HI>to direct the Conduct of his Ministers</HI></Q> and if <HI>"the Apostles have set an Example to their Followers;"</HI> Then certainly the <HI>secular</HI> Authority of the Bishops, and the Authority of the <HI>spiritual Courts,</HI> is a <HI>forbidden Authority;</HI> and they must be <HI>wicked,</HI> who take it upon them. Now, Eusebius, pray be plain and honest, and don't <HI>shuff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le in your Answer. It is your Business</HI> to prove this <HI>a regular Authority,</HI> and vindicate the Bishops Temporal Authority and spiritual Courts: <HI>for</HI> (to return you your own Words again) <HI>your All that's dear de∣pends upon it.</HI> — Whether that Text forbids all Inequali∣ty among Ministers, or not, this must be acknowledg'd, it forbids
<PB N="54" REF="003651_0094_10023C6C01BDE470"/>them the use of <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>temporal</HI> Power at least; I say, the <HI>Use,</HI> as well as the <HI>Abuse,</HI> of such kind of Power, is forbidden in those Words of Christ, <HI>Among you it shall not be so.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Remark (<HI>p.</HI> 52.) <Q><HI>which he speaks by way of</HI> Negation, <HI>not Prohibition,</HI></Q> 'tis a groundless Distinction. For the Apostles in part explain'd our Lord's Intention, when they said, <HI>It is not Reason, that we shou'd leave the word of God and serve Tables.</HI> Much less Reason is there that Bishops shou'd leave the word of God, to serve as <HI>Lord Treasurers,</HI> as some of 'em have done, or to serve in <HI>Parliament,</HI> as they all (but one) do. I see no possible means to reconcile their Practice to that of the Apostles, <HI>who gave themselves continually to Prayer and to the Ministry of the Word:</HI> nor is their Conduct reconcilable to the Duty charg'd on Bishop TIMOTHY; <HI>Neglect not the Gift that is in Thee; Meditate on these Things; give thy self</HI> WHOLLY <HI>to them; Preach the Word, be instant in Season, out of Season. Endure Hardness, as a good Soldier of Jesus Christ: No Man that warteth, intangleth himself with the Affairs of this Life.</HI> These Divine Precepts and Prohibitions necessarily cashier the Bishop of his <HI>Court-Employments,</HI> and <HI>secular Lordship.</HI> As for their criminal Lording in <HI>Spirituals,</HI> I refer to <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s VINDICATION, (<HI>page</HI> 4, <HI>to</HI> 47.) both for history &amp; argument.</P>
<P><HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Construction of that Passage, <HI>He that is chief</HI> &amp;c. is against the whole Stream of Protestant Writers; who con∣stantly apply this Text in Opposition to the usurped Supre∣macy of <HI>Rome:</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> do's so in particular. But <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Construction of it (<HI>p.</HI> 49.) is fairly reconcilable with <HI>Peter's</HI> Supremacy among the Apostles, and makes as much for a <HI>Pope,</HI> as for a <HI>Prelate.</HI> And by his way of arguing in <HI>page</HI> 52d for ought I see, the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> may <HI>keep his Crown,</HI> as well as any other Prelate his <HI>Mitre,</HI> and <HI>all the Authority spiritual and temporal he now enjoys in the World.</HI> If the Bishops of <HI>En∣gland</HI> are "<HI>Lords</HI> by the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Courtesy</HI>" (as he observes <HI>p.</HI> 53.) I subjoyn, the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> is more than that by the Courtesy of <HI>many</HI> Kings, and once was so even of <HI>our own</HI> for many Ages. In which Remarks, <Q><HI>my Aim is to discover</HI> this Gentleman's <HI>Mistake by what is call'd</HI> REDUCTIO <HI>ad</HI> AB∣SURDUM;</Q> and to caution him, that he be not found at last in the Tents of <HI>Rome,</HI> whither his Argument has so pal∣pable and direct a Tendency.— It puts me in Mind of a remarkable admonitory Passage in a Letter of Bishop HALL'S to (Archbishop) LAUD: <Q>God crieth (says he) with <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> WHO <HI>is on my Side? Who?</HI> Look at last out of your Win∣dow
<PB N="55" REF="003651_0094_10023C6C01BDE470"/>to Him, and in a resolute Courage cast down the <HI>Jez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bel,</HI> that hath bewitched you.</Q></P>
<P>It's hardly worth while to make any Observations on <HI>Eu∣sebius</HI>'s learned Management of the Argument (<HI>page</HI> 50, 51.) where he is <HI>"trying the matter in another Light."</HI> For as to the Doctrine asserted by <HI>Elutherius</HI> (Dial. <HI>p.</HI> 38.) <Q>That the Christian Church being founded on Christ'. <HI>Resurrection,</HI> there cou'd be no <HI>Ministers</HI> nor indeed <HI>Members</HI> of this Church, before it had a Being;</Q> He has the Happiness to be able <HI>to</HI> produce good Episcopal Authorities for it. Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> is fully in the Opinion: See <HI>Irenicum,</HI> p. 210,—218—So Bishop <HI>Lloyd</HI> (Serm. on <HI>Act.</HI> 2.42.) tells us, <Q>That the Disciples, when Christ administred the Supper to them, were not then in Orders, but were <HI>Laymen;</HI> for (says he) it was before our Lord's <HI>Death,</HI> and he did not <HI>ordain</HI> them till after his <HI>Resurrection.</HI></Q>—This is enough to shew that Elutherius's Doctrine is no peculiar <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Tenet: and therefore whatever Conclusions <HI>Eusebius</HI> pretends to draw from it, they can no more be turn'd to the Prejudice of our Cause, than of his own.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone thro' the <HI>Dialogue</HI> betwen <HI>Eusebius &amp; Elu∣therius;</HI> bestowing all the Remarks, that cou'd be tho't needful: and must say upon the whole, I believe, every judicious and un∣prejudic'd Reader will easily concur with me in this Reflection, That <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Conference has very little answer'd the <HI>Title</HI> given it; for ELUTHERIUS appears as yet in sound Health and Vigour, free from all perceivable Symptoms of ENERVATION: and need be in no <HI>Haste</HI> to fly this redoubted Champion.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XIV. I observe, <HI>Philalethes</HI> is sensible (by what he says in the <HI>Close,</HI> p. 53.) that <HI>Eusebius</HI> had made many <HI>Omissions</HI> in his Examination of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Dialogue (only <HI>nibbling</HI> at a few Passages here and there) and therefore for a further An∣swer to it, refers his Friend <HI>Attalus</HI> to the LETTERS <HI>he had lent him.</HI>—But what need of those Letters to satisfy <HI>Attalus,</HI> when <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Arguments in the Conference had so satisfactorily solv'd all his Scruples, and pour'd in upon him such irresistible Conviction; as to engage him instantly in the Resolution of <HI>"returning to his Parish-Church"</HI> without any more Adoe, and to transport him suddenly into the Height of Bigotry!—Truly it looks, I must profess, very <HI>odd</HI> and ridiculous, to make the Conference shut up with so surprizing an <HI>Epilogue.</HI> Nor wou'd I give a Fig for a Thousand such
<PB N="56" REF="003651_0095_10023C9242218840"/>hasty and passionate Converts; immediately commencing un∣charitable Zealots, inspir'd with the narrow and hot Spirit of a <HI>Party:</HI> altho' <HI>Eusebius</HI> (it seems) <Q><HI>thinks his Pains well recompenc'd by this Resolution of</HI> Attalus, <HI>his old Friend</HI></Q>—Well, I leave 'em now to lay their Heads sweetly together, and please themselves, like true Lovers of Christian Peace and Charity, with railing at Dissenters, and uniting in the common Cry of the furious Herd, <HI>Better a Papist, than a Presbyterian!</HI></P>
<P>I find but one Thing further, that deserves any Notice; and that is an OBSERVATION <HI>Philalethes</HI> merrily suggests by way of Banter (<HI>p</HI> 54) which yet some may think is in <HI>part</HI> too true to make a Jest of. The Gentleman here seems indeed to have struck upon one of the cardinal Distempers of his Church's Constitution; namely, SIMPLE <HI>Presbyters,</HI> stript of the useful ministerial Powers of Ordination and Government, to furnish <HI>dignify'd Officers</HI> with an <HI>overgrown</HI> Power, of little Significance to the main Ends of the Ministry, and comparatively <HI>useless,</HI> as being stretcht to an extravagant Extent, "beyond the Sphere of human Activity," and in∣cumber'd too with Abundance of civil Avocations. Verily we look on this part of the Constitution, SIMPLE <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as exceptionable almost as any Thing in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> For, as to <HI>Bishops,</HI> i. e. such in whom those Powers of ordain∣ing Ministers, and governing the Church, are united; let us but have <HI>Plenty</HI> enough of 'em (a Bishop to every Parish, if they will) and we are content: Or if they must be more <HI>general</HI> Officers, we cou'd yet submit to them upon Occasion; provided their Episcopacy be duly limited, so as to be a mere <HI>Presidency of Order,</HI> and to leave the other Presbyters in full Possession of the Powers inherent in their Pastoral Office.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Prelates,</HI> our Adversaries plead for, are quite of a different Cast; inviron'd with such peculiar Cir∣cumstances, as make them obnoxious to great Exceptions: and truly the <HI>whole Model</HI> of their beloved Hierarchy appears to me in such an unproportion'd and disjoynted Condition, as exposes it to just and insuperable Objections. Suffer me to give you a brief <HI>View</HI> of it, according to the best Accounts I can obtain. Without descending to every Particularity, take these general Hints</P>
<P>You must observe then, in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the DEACONS leaving their proper Work of <HI>serving Tables,</HI> do for a short Season officiate as a kind of <HI>Half-Priests;</HI> being admitted to <HI>baptize,</HI> as well as <HI>preach,</HI> by the Bishop's Li∣cence,
<PB N="57" REF="003651_0095_10023C9242218840"/>but excluded from consecrating the <HI>Eucharist:</HI> And the PARISH-PRIESTS, are in point of Power and Practice, little more than <HI>Half-Ministers;</HI> having no Hand in the Business of <HI>Ordination,</HI> subject to the <HI>Impositions</HI> of Superiors in matters of <HI>Government,</HI> and debar'd all <HI>publick</HI> and formal Exercise of Ecclesiastical <HI>Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>Again observe, Here the <HI>Presbyters</HI> are held to be all <HI>Jure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ativo</HI> on a <HI>Level,</HI> in regard of ministerial Power, as being of one and the same Order: yet there are RECTORS, or Par∣sons of Parishes, that have other Presbyters in <HI>Subordination to</HI> them, as their <HI>Curates</HI> or Deputies, who are <HI>de facto</HI> con∣troul'd by their Masters at pleasure, and allow'd to do no∣thing of Importance without their Leave. And there are ARCH-DEACONS, so called, tho' not of the Order of Deacons, but <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who hold their <HI>Courts,</HI> and are Superinten∣dents over the inferior Clergy in their respective Districts.</P>
<P>Observe again, Here the <HI>Bishops</HI> are asserted to be all of one Order and equal Authority; yet <HI>Two</HI> of these, possessing <HI>Metropolitan</HI> Sees, are named ARCH-BISHOPS, and the rest of the Prelates at their Consecration take a solemn OATH OF DUE OBEDIENCE to them, in their respective Provinces. One is <HI>Primate of England;</HI> the other of <HI>all England.</HI></P>
<P>Again, here <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> are doctrinally held to be two <HI>different</HI> Orders: and yet are practically <HI>blended</HI> toge∣er in several Respects. For in the Church of <HI>England</HI> there are <HI>Presbyters</HI> having Government over Presbyters; as in the Case of the <HI>Cathedral</HI> DEAN who claims and exercises Jurisdictions, in certain Points, uncontroulable by the <HI>Bishops;</HI> and in the Case of <HI>Arch-Deacons,</HI> "who act (so Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> observes) as <HI>Bishops,</HI> without Controul." Yet neither of these is of the <HI>Order,</HI> to which <HI>that kind</HI> of Government (I mean the Government of the <HI>Clergy</HI>) is pretended to be appropri∣ated. — I omit subordinate <HI>Officials, Commissaries,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yea, here are Some of the very LAITY exercising <HI>Episcopal</HI> Powers over the inferior <HI>sacred Orders;</HI> and even the <HI>Rectors</HI> of Parishes, tho' claiming something of <HI>Pastoral</HI> Authority, must with an implicit Faith obey the spiritual <HI>Courts,</HI> under the Con∣duct of those irregular Ecclesiasticks: who were never heard of in <HI>Antiquity,</HI> about which our Adversaries so loudly din us in the Ear continually, but are of <HI>novel</HI> Invention.</P>
<P>Here the BISHOPS have the Honour to be <HI>temporal Princes,</HI> Members of the House of <HI>Lords;</HI> but are scarce any better than mere <HI>titular</HI> Administrators of Church-Discipline: tho'
<PB N="58" REF="003651_0096_10023C7D72962A30"/>pretended to be <HI>sole Pastors</HI> of large Diocesses, at least the <HI>chief Governors;</HI> yet seem really to stand for little more than <HI>Cyphers,</HI> in the Ecclesiastical Courts.— Here are CHANCEL∣LORS, mercinary <HI>Laymen,</HI> yet <HI>spiritual Lords;</HI> having in fact the Power of Excommunication, and Absolution (two of the most important Branches of Ecclesiastical Judgment) lodged in their hands; exclusive of the <HI>Parochial</HI> Clergy, and (as it seems) unaccountable to their <HI>Diocesans:</HI> and the Forms of Proceeding in their Courts are such (so Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> complains) as have in a great measure enervated all Church-Discipline. And further here are EXEMPT <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in the Quality of <HI>Deans,</HI> practising <HI>Episcopal</HI> Authority (tho' in Contradiction to their Principle, says Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI>) independent on the Bi∣shops, in the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CULIARS (so called) which are evidently <HI>Imperium in Imperio.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, the KING is according to our <HI>English</HI> Constitution the sole Fountain of all Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical: and <HI>Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, and other ecclesiastical Persons, have</HI> NO MANNER <HI>of Jurisdiction, but</HI> BY <HI>and under the King</HI>'s <HI>Majesty;</HI> who is supreme Head of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in Contradistinction to the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and is final Judge of Controversies <HI>in all Things and Causes spiritual.</HI></P>
<P>This is a summary, and I think true State of Matters of Fact in the establish'd <HI>National</HI> Church. And who now can forbear admiring the goodly Order, the rare Symmetry, Har∣mony and Consistence in this Ecclesiastical Oeconomy! What other than a <HI>Golden</HI> Foundation must this beautiful and noble Superstructure be thought to stand upon! No Wonder, we hear the venerable Hierarchy so often glory'd in, as the <HI>best constituted</HI> in the World. Nor need any man wonder, that when this incomparable Constitution became well establish'd and secure, it was thought fit to <HI>expunge</HI> that remarkable Passage in some ancient Editions of the Liturgy, as grown an <HI>unnecessary</HI> and <HI>obsol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te</HI> Article of Prayer; which however, because I wou'd not abruptly dismiss our Episcopal <HI>Dialogue,</HI> without the Decency of an agreable Conclusion, and I can think of none better at present, I shall take Liberty to repeat (as still hope I may with Propriety, and shall with Seri∣ousness do) on this Occasion:— <Q><HI>From the Tyranny of the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>and from all his detestable Enormities, Good Lord! deliver us.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>PART II. Remarks on</HI> Two <HI>LETTERS,</HI> in Defence of the Episcopal Government of the Church.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> I. <SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen I was perusing these Letters, and came to that <HI>Marginal</HI> Note the Author gives us (<HI>p.</HI> 87.) I cou'd not help admiring at the Conduct of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> in palming them on the World, as "<HI>written by a</HI> LAYMAN": Unless by a Figure, he intended to transfer this Character to <HI>a dear Friend of his,</HI> who doubtless was mightily pleas'd with that shrewd OBSERVATION in the Close of the <HI>Dialogue</HI> (offer'd as a Consequence upon <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Argument) That the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church must be <HI>mere human Creatures,</HI> if their <HI>Bishops</HI> at best be but such. (<HI>p.</HI> 54) — I take Occasion to say here, That <HI>his Flirt</HI> at the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> (as I take it) in the following Words, <Q><HI>Since all their Power is derived from such Creatures, it must be merely human still, and not of Christ's appointing;</HI></Q> This, I say, being but obscure as to the Reference, and not expresly level'd at <HI>us,</HI> it escap'd my Notice at first; and I now forgive it, since he makes so light of a <HI>Lay</HI>-Character, and appears so willing to share with us in the <HI>Odium</HI> of a Lay-Derivation.</P>
<P>I find little of solid Argument, in these Letters, that's new, and not already obviated in the foregoing Papers. However, that my Rev. Brother <HI>Layman</HI> may have no Colour for Complaint of being treated as <HI>"too contemptible a Person to be our Adver∣sary in this Controversy,"</HI> I will consider the principal Contents of his Letters; which being made publick without any particu∣lar Direction, every one may claim a Right to make what Return he thinks fit unto them.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> Letter, we perceive, had an <HI>Answer</HI> made unto it by the Gentleman it was sent to in <HI>Manuscript;</HI> which, I'm humbly of Opinion, it wou'd have been but a piece of
<PB N="60" REF="003651_0097_10023C7FCD9CAA38"/>common Justice in Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> to have publish'd at the same time, or else to have suppress'd his <HI>second</HI> Letter, in Reply thereto. Nevertheless, we will follow him in his own Path, and e'en take Things as we find them.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> II. I am glad to find this Gentleman declaring (<HI>p.</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) <Q><HI>We agreed upon the holy</HI> SCRIPTURES <HI>for the</HI> RULE, <HI>by which this Controversy should be</HI> DECIDED:</Q> and cannot but highly approve the <HI>Caution</HI> he expresses and inculcates, <Q><HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st mistak∣ing that for the</HI> SENSE <HI>of this Rule, which is</HI> NOT, <HI>we set up</HI> OUR OWN <HI>Schemes and Imaginations, instead of the Divine Appointments.</HI></Q> To prevent this, he lays down <HI>two Rules</HI> for the <HI>right interpreting</HI> of Scripture.</P>
<P>His <HI>first</HI> Rule, i. e. <HI>"Comparing one Passage with another"</HI> &amp;c. is not only a very <HI>just</HI> and <HI>reasonable</HI> one (as he says) but the most effectual and satisfactory. This is the Rule with all true <HI>Protestants:</HI> by this Method the Reformers confounded the Papists, and in this Way the primitive Fathers were wont to confute Hereticks. And if in this way the Cause of the <HI>New England</HI> Churches cannot be supported, we are willing to lose it. Bishop <HI>Jewel</HI> quotes <HI>Ambrose,</HI> saying, <Q><HI>Interrogemus</HI> Pe∣trum; <HI>Interrogemus</HI> Paulum; <HI>si Verum volumus invenire</HI></Q> Let us hear and compare what <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> say, if we wou'd find out the Truth.— <HI>"Scripture is the Interpreter of it self,"</HI> says <HI>Chrysostom.</HI> This was also the Judgment of an older Father than these, I mean <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> <Q><HI>The lawful and securest Exposition of Scripture,</HI> saith he, <HI>is according to the Scriptures themselves.</HI></Q> (Vid. Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> Remains. <HI>p.</HI> 131.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> III. As for our Author's <HI>other</HI> Rule (<HI>p.</HI> 58.) <Q><HI>That in doubtful Cases we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> chuse that Interpretation of Scripture, which is most agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd unanimous Sense and Practice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI></Q> I shall offer the following Remarks upon it: which will be a full answer to all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he has advanc'd in support thereof.</P>
<P>In the first place, let it be observ'd: If we are in <HI>doubtful</HI> Cases to form our Judgment by the Sense and Practice of the Church <HI>from the Beginning,</HI> this <HI>second</HI> Rule appears to me <HI>coincident</HI> with the first: for <HI>the Beginning</HI> must take in the Times of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles;</HI> which the <HI>Scriptures</HI> only give us an authen∣tick and sufficient Account of. There are no Interpretations of Scripture, <HI>out</HI> of Scripture, truly from the <HI>Beginning,</HI> that I know of: and therefore none necessary to be believ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="61" REF="003651_0097_10023C7FCD9CAA38"/>giving us the genuine Sense of Scripture. If the <HI>Beginning</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st be taken into the Account, we may well stop at the <HI>Scrip∣tures;</HI> which deliver to us the fullest and truest Reports of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at.</HI> Yet if there be any <HI>Tradi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> Interpretations of Scrip∣ture, let 'em be produc'd, and prov'd to be of <HI>Apostolical</HI> De∣rivation: We are ready to receive the Sense of Scrip∣ture, upon the Authority of true <HI>Original</HI> Tradition. But where is this to be found, save in the <HI>Bible</HI> it self! If then we must recur to the <HI>Beginning</HI> (without which indeed it were absurd, to pretend to the <HI>universal</HI> Sense of the Church) by Consequence we must content our selves with the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> as the ONLY Rule to judge by in all Controversies of Religion, arising among such as believe the Scriptures: <Q>and those that cannot <HI>thus</HI> be ended (i. e. by Scripture, without the Help of Fathers and Traditions) are not necessary to be believed, one way or other.</Q> So determines the learned <HI>Chillingworth.</HI> (Relig. of Prot. <HI>p.</HI> 102.) <Q>And our Reason hereof <HI>(says he)</HI> is convincing; Because nothing can challenge our Belief, but what hath descended to us from CHRIST by <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Universal</HI> Tradition: Now NOTHING but <HI>Scripture</HI> hath <HI>thus</HI> descended to us; Therefore nothing but Scrip∣ture can challenge our Belief.</Q></P>
<P>This now destroys Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s specious Pretence of <Q><HI>the primitive Church</HI>'s being <HI>a</HI> SAFE WITNESS, <HI>in what Sense the Apostles wou'd have themselves to be understood.</HI></Q> For here∣in He goes upon the Supposition of two Things, neither of which are to be granted as undoubtedly true.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> it supposes that the <HI>primitive</HI> Church <HI>certainly know,</HI> and <HI>unanimously agreed,</HI> in what Sense the Apostles wou'd have the obscure places in their Writings to be understood. Where∣as in fact there appears no such <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Judgment among the <HI>Ancients,</HI> as to the Meaning of Scripture in doubtful places, nor <HI>Harmony</HI> of Sense and Practice in many Matters relating to the Church, it's Worship, Discipline, and Government. Whatever <Q><HI>Advantages</HI> (as our Author insinuates) <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y were under, not to mistake the Apostles Meaning, above us at this Distance</HI></Q>: yet it must be acknowledg'd, that the <HI>Fathers</HI> differ'd among themselves about the Interpretation of many Texts of Scripture, and in as important Points as those dis∣puted among <HI>Protestants</HI></P>
<P>In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed Point of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> if the Fathers be con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>d as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of Scripture, either there was no uni∣versal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is manifestly in favour of
<PB N="62" REF="003651_0098_10023C9519F06D38"/><HI>Presbyterian</HI> Parity. I am free to challenge Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> to produce the <HI>universal Consent</HI> of ancient Commentaries, for his Doctrine of the <HI>Divine Right</HI> of Bishops, a an <HI>Order</HI> superior to Presbyters, and <HI>esteem'd</HI> a FUNDAMENTAL of <HI>Religion;</HI> as (<HI>p.</HI> 84) he says it was in those primitive Times: For I'm persuaded, he'll be hard put to it, to advance so much as the <HI>Shadow</HI> of a single Testimony to it in any ancient <HI>Expo∣sitor.</HI> So great and absolute a <HI>Stranger</HI> is this wild Opinion to all <HI>Antiquity.</HI></P>
<P>And if we consider the Fathers as <HI>Witnesses</HI> to Matters of Practice, tho' it is not to be deny'd, that those who lived in or nigh the Apostles Time, were the most likely Persons to know the Truth of Facts, and the most proper to report them, and might as Historians challenge a common Credit with us, in Case it were evident, that their Care to <HI>inform themselves</HI> a∣right was equal to their Opportunities, and that they <HI>agreed</HI> in their Reports, and that their <HI>Writings</HI> have been deliver'd down to us, in their original <HI>Purity</HI> and Integrity, without material Depravations, Losses and Defects: which is <HI>another</HI> Supposition, the Gentleman builds upon; for how else can the <HI>primitive Church</HI> be pleaded as a <HI>safe Witness!</HI> Yet what say judicious Inquirers, on these Heads? <Q>We plainly see, (says Dr. EDWARDS, in his Discourse concerning the <HI>Fathers,</HI> p. 136.) that some of the ancient Writers were <HI>not diligent</HI> enough in enquiring into the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>exact</HI> Accounts of Things; but instead of that contented themselves with a <HI>superficial</HI> Notice of them, and were <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>areless,</HI> and took Things upon <HI>Trust.</HI> Wherefore (says he) tho' there is nothing more common than to make use of the <HI>Fathers</HI> Names and Testimonies, yet we have Reason to conclude that nothing is more uncertain and preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious.</Q></P>
<P>This will appear in a more convincing Light, if we consi∣der <HI>thro' whose hands</HI> the Fathers Writings have come down to us; even such as have used their utmost Art to make them speak the Language of <HI>Rome.</HI> And therefore none are louder in boasting of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> as their Witnesses, than the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctors; because having taken such Care to make the Fa∣thers <HI>their own,</HI> they think they may safely shroud themselves under their Authority.</P>
<P>Hear those just Remarks of good Bishop HALL (<HI>Works</HI> p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>18▪) upon <Q><HI>the Grounds of the</HI> Papists <HI>Confidence in appeal∣ing to the Fathers.</HI>— Our Adversaries (says he) knowing of themselves (that which <HI>Tertul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian</HI> saith of all Heresies)
<PB N="63" REF="003651_0098_10023C9519F06D38"/>That if Appeale be made to the sacred Bench of <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles,</HI> they cannot stand; <HI>remove</HI> the Suit of Religion <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tily,</HI> into the Court of the <HI>Fathers.</HI>— There be two things, that give them heart in this Provocation: One, the <HI>Bastardy</HI> of false Fathers; the other, the <HI>Corruption</HI> of the true. What a Flourish doe they make with <HI>usurp∣ed Names?</HI> Whom wou'd it not amaze, to see the frequent Citations of the <HI>Apostles</HI> own Canons, Constitutions, Litur∣gies, Masses,— Epistles decretall, of <HI>Clemens,</HI> — and an hundred other Bishop holy and ancient: Most whereof have crept out of the <HI>Vatican</HI> or <HI>Cloysters:</HI>— that I may say nothing of those <HI>infinite</HI> Writings, which either Ignorance, or Wilfulness, hath fathered upon <HI>every</HI> of the Fathers.— This <HI>Fraud</HI> is more easily avoided.— Most Danger is in the secret <HI>Corruption</HI> of the true and acknow∣ledged Issue of those gracious Parents; whom through dose and crafty handling, the, have induced to <HI>belye</HI> those that begot them, and to <HI>betray</HI> their Fathers, either with <HI>Silence,</HI> or <HI>false</HI> Evidence. Plainly, how are the <HI>honoured Volumes</HI> of faithful <HI>Antiquity,</HI> BLURRED, INTERLINED, ALTERED DEPRAVED, by subtile Treachery; and made to speak what they meant not?— Hence those Fathers are some-where <HI>not</HI> OURS: what Wonder? While they are <HI>not</HI> THEMSELUES.</Q> — <HI>Hinc Origo Mali. Hinc <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lachrymae.</HI> And now after all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Labours to restore the Fathers to their primitive Purity, by conferring various Copies &amp;c. and notwithstanding all the Fidelity and Care us'd by our Translators, that "<HI>have taken so much la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dable Pains of late to make 'em speak</HI> ENGLISH," it remains uncertain whether any of those Writings are all-over <HI>genuine,</HI> and free from <HI>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious</HI> Words and Passages: So that here is no possible <HI>Sure-Footing.</HI></P>
<P>But admit they be genuine and of good Credit; yet where is the <HI>Consent</HI> of Antiquity, so much talk'd of! Was there a perfect Uniformity of <HI>Practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> among the primitive Churches? It appears not in the <HI>Histories</HI> of those Times.

<P>But, again, supposing these ancient Authors in their Ac∣counts of Facts, reported nothing of a Variety of Principles and Practices in the primitive Church; yet how do's this give us
<PB N="64" REF="003651_0099_10023C97AA805348"/><HI>Assurance</HI> of an actual Uniformity, or prove any Tradition Apostolical by <HI>the universal and unanimous Suffrage</HI> of the Church of God from <HI>the Beginning!</HI> For Worthy Bishop HALL complains, not only that the ancient <HI>Witnesses</HI> have been cor∣rupted, but <HI>some of them purged to</HI> DEATH.

We have been robbed of the Records of the first Times of Christi∣anity, whereof <HI>scarce any Footsteps</HI> do remain." And else∣where (Pref. to <HI>Antiq. Apostol.</HI>) he laments "<HI>the irrepa∣rable Loss</HI> of the primitive Records, which the Injury of Time hath deprived us of; the <HI>Substance</HI> being gone, and little left us but the SHELL and CARCASE.</Q> — Now if this be the Case, I cannot but wonder that any Persons of good Sense and Judgment can allow themselves to talk of the <HI>universal Consent</HI> of Antiquity, the <HI>unanimous Suffrage</HI> of the primitive Church &amp;c. and make that a Standard of Ortho∣doxy, which is but a mere <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opian</HI> Fancy, a visionary Illusi∣on, and no Reality. The Suffrage of the primitive Church in any Case must necessarily be very <HI>defective</HI> and <HI>imperfect,</HI> if so much of the ancient Records are lost, that we have no∣thing left us but the <HI>Shell</HI> and <HI>Carcase.</HI> And here, by the Way, it is a good Observation of Dr. EDWARDS (<HI>Rem.</HI> p. 139.) <Q>Perhaps it is by the particular and over-ruling <HI>Providence</HI> of God, that there are so few ancient Writings left, that there∣by the <HI>Authority of the holy Scriptures</HI> may be more attended to and relied upon by us.</Q> To which I will add that of the eminent Archbishop TILLOTSON (<HI>Rule of Faith,</HI> Fol.

<P>Upon the whole, I cannot but sincerely joyn with Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> in putting my self under the Conduct of those sacred Texts, <HI>Jer</HI> 6.16 <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.8.— <HI>Ask for the old Paths— Go thy way forth by the Footsteps of the Flock.</HI> But I differ from him exceedingly, when he thinks, that <Q><HI>God seems</HI> here <HI>to point out</HI> his second <HI>Rule to us</HI>;</Q> i.e. To <HI>take the primitive C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urch for a safe Witness, in what Sense the Apostles wou'd have themselves to be understood,</HI> in doubtful places of Scripture▪ For this wou'd be a setting up human Tradition, to ascertain the Sense of Divine Writt: which is quite opposite to the Scope and Spirit of those Texts; and sets the Old Testament against the New, which tells us how our <HI>Saviour</HI> dealt severely with the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> on this very head; their imposing the Traditions of <HI>the Elders,</HI> and <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI> He corrects their <HI>Traditional Interpretations</HI> of the Law, by referring 'em to the <HI>original</HI> Institution and Practice, as recorded in Scripture. <HI>It was not so from the Beginning,</HI> says He: <HI>Search the Scriptures.</HI>— That now is <HI>asking for the old Paths;</HI> Inquiring out God's Ways, published by <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets.</HI> (Compare <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.17. and 18.15 and <HI>Mal</HI> 2.8.) That's <HI>going forth by the Footsteps of the Flock;</HI> attending to the Examples of the <HI>holy Patriarchs,</HI> and others, graced with ho∣nourable Testimonies in <HI>Scripture-Story;</HI> and being <HI>Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</HI>— Yet this must be taken with a <HI>Limitation:</HI> such as that the <HI>Apostle</HI> makes in propounding himself for a Pattern; 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 11.1. <HI>Be ye Followers of me, even as I also am of</HI> CHRIST. He adds, <HI>Now I praise you, Brethren, that you remember me</HI> (my Doctrine, as well as Example) <HI>in all things, and keep the</HI> ORDINANCES, <HI>as I delivered them to you.— For I have received of the</HI> LORD, <HI>that which also I delivered unto you.</HI> (Compare <HI>Chap.</HI> 15.2.) Here then is our Rule, <HI>to follow them who follow</HI> CHRIST; and they are said to be <HI>Followers of Christ,</HI> who <HI>keep the Ordi∣nances,</HI> which the APOSTLES <HI>receiv'd of the Lord,</HI> and have <HI>delivered unto us,</HI> i. e. in their inspir'd Writings. This is the <HI>true Tradition,</HI> which we may safely follow: This, the <HI>Stan∣dard,</HI> to which we must reduce our Belief and Practice in Re∣ligion; and not entertain the Doctrine or Example of others, whether Ancients or Moderns, without bringing 'em to <HI>this</HI> sacred Test, the <HI>written</HI> Tradition of the Apostles. The <HI>Papists</HI> indeed are for an <HI>Oral</HI> Tradition; and by this Means they
<PB N="64" REF="003651_0100_10023CAE600FA058"/>stamp all their <HI>novel</HI> Opinions and Practices, with the vene∣rable Name of <HI>Antiquity.</HI> Agreably Bishop JEWEL observes, <Q>There is no Toy so <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>fabulous,</HI> but they are able by their Cunning to bring it <HI>lineally,</HI> either from <HI>Christ,</HI> or his <HI>Apostles,</HI> or from one or other of the ancient <HI>Fathers.</HI></Q> Those <HI>Traditional</HI> Doctors, it's well known, have been the notorious <HI>Corrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> of Religion. <HI>Tradition</HI> was the grand Cry of the ancient <HI>Hereticks:</HI> This was the constant Cant of the <HI>Pharisees;</HI> and has been the Pretext made use of in every Age, to colour over the Whims of those that wou'd be <HI>wise above what is written.</HI> I am sorry to hear any <HI>Protestants</HI> joyn∣ing with <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> in this Noise and Din about the <HI>Tradition of the Elders,</HI> the <HI>Suffrage of the primitive Church;</HI> as if the Voice of Antiquiry were necessary to settle the Sense and supply the Defects of Scripture, and Orthodoxy were to be determin'd by Votes. Mr. <HI>Layman's</HI> Primitive Church a <HI>safe Witness,</HI> is but another Phrase for the Popish <HI>Oral Tradition;</HI> for tho' it be <HI>written</HI> now, it was but <HI>Oral</HI> a good while: and so the Arguments of <HI>Protestants</HI> against that Point of <HI>Popery,</HI> may in a great measure be turn'd against him. For my part, I am not for professing the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion upon <HI>Popish</HI> Principles: and shou'd be asham'd of any Opinion, that can't be defended but upon a Principle, that disgraces the Scrip∣ture, reflects on the Wisdom and Sovereignty of Christ, as Lawgiver to his Church, and tends to overset the <HI>main Pillar of the Reformation;</HI> For I look on the Protestant Cause to stand on this <HI>Basis,</HI> That <HI>the word of Christ is the only Rule of Faith, which every Man is at Liberty to judge of for himself.</HI> And I must freely confess, I had rather mistake in some Things of <HI>lesser</HI> Consequence (for I am in no Danger of falling into any <HI>damnable Heresies</HI>) in the way of <HI>a sincere resolute Adhe∣rence to the Word of Christ as my</HI> ONLY <HI>Rule;</HI> than resign my Reason and Conscience to the Conduct of ancient <HI>Fathers,</HI> and receive their Dictates with an implicit Faith and Obedi∣ence, under the fond Notion of their being SAFE <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Apostles meaning in doubtful Cases. The BIBLE is the Religion of <HI>Protestants;</HI> If this be the Ground of our Faith, and Model of our Worship and Practice, our Religion will be <HI>Divine,</HI> and we shall truly walk in the <HI>old Paths, the good Way,</HI> the Way of Safety and Happiness: Whereas, so far as we build on <HI>Traditions</HI> of Men, our Faith will be but <HI>human,</HI> our Reli∣gion <HI>vain,</HI> and our Path full of Snares.

S <HI>Cyprian</HI> saith, <HI>Si ad Divinae Traditionis Caput &amp; Originem revertamur, cessat Error humanus:</HI> If we returne to the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Origi∣nal</HI> of the heavenly <HI>Tradition</HI> (which is the <HI>Word of God</HI>) all human Error giveth place.</Q> And elsewhere (<HI>Ser.</HI> on 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.11.) the Bishop utters himself in the Language of a true Protestant, in some very pertinent Observations; which I shall take the Pleasure to transcribe, and are highly worth the Readers Attention. He observes; <Q>Christ saith, <HI>All Things which I have heard of my Father, I have delivered unto you:</HI> — and, whereas the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Sadduces</HI> had moved the Questions of Divorcement, and the Resurrecti∣on, he never had Recourse unto the RABBINES, but al∣waies to the WORD of the Lord.— <HI>Basil</HI> doth say, That that Man, which dareth <HI>put to or take away</HI> any thing <HI>from</HI> the Scriptures of God, is either <HI>a feeble Christian,</HI> or a notable <HI>arrogant Fellow.</HI> To put to the Word of God the <HI>Inventions of Men,</HI> what other Thing may it seem, than to mingle <HI>new Wine,</HI> not with old Wine, but with Wine that is <HI>dead,</HI> and with <HI>Lees</HI> or <HI>Dreggs?</HI> and to joyne <HI>Light</HI> with <HI>Darkness,</HI> a wild <HI>Beast</HI> with a <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>Man</HI> with God? — For although very much by the Judgment of all Men is to be given to the <HI>Fathers,</HI> yet were they Men, and might <HI>erre.</HI> Truely, to speak nothing else of them, they did oftentimes VERY <HI>ill agree</HI> among themselves about VERY <HI>great</HI> and <HI>weighty</HI> Matters. But the <HI>Word of God</HI> is sure and firme, and certaine, and appointed for every Time. — O if the Word of the Lord might be heard, among so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamours, and in so great a hurly burly: If we wou'd suffer <HI>God himself</HI> to sit as <HI>Judge</HI> in his owne Case, the Matter wou'd be passed over with lesse Tumult a great deale, and more easily might we agree about the whole Matter. Wherefore, if <HI>all</HI> the Worship of God, <HI>all</HI> Godlinesse, <HI>all</HI> Religion, be to be sought out of the <HI>Word of God:</HI> If the Institutions of <HI>Men</HI> have miserably PER∣VERTED <HI>all Things</HI> in <HI>all Times;</HI> let us, my Brethren, unto whome the Office of <HI>Teaching</HI> is alotted, consider how DANGEROUS a thing it is to <HI>speak more:</HI> and let all, who will be, and will have themselves accounted to be
<PB N="66" REF="003651_0101_10023CD847BB2428"/><HI>Christians,</HI> remember how DANG<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ROUS a thing it is to <HI>be∣lieve</HI> MORE. Let us not be wedded too much to oar <HI>owne Wit:</HI> let us not be wedded too much to the <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Forefathers.</HI> — When wee shall be placed before that dreadful Judgement-Seate, when all Things shall burne, and the Angels of God shall tremble, to what <HI>Fathers,</HI> to what Decrees of our <HI>Forefathers,</HI> shall we Wretches then <HI>appeale?</HI> Wee shall then have Refuge to CHRIST <HI>alone;</HI> then shall wee use the <HI>Aide</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> of Christ alone. Wherefore let us not be of so secure a Minde in so great a Matter: Our Life, our Soul, our Salvation, is the Thing in hand.</Q> Thus in the <HI>Sermon.</HI> And the Bishop in his <HI>Defence</HI> of it against Dr. <HI>Cole</HI>'s Exceptions (<HI>Reply,</HI> p. 44) addresses himself to him in that pathetick manner: <Q>O Master Doctour, let us lay aside all Selfe-Will and Con∣tention, and have Recourse <HI>only</HI> unto the <HI>Truth,</HI> that God hath revealed to us in his holy <HI>Word.</HI> For <HI>thereby</HI> shall ye be able to <HI>know</HI> whether the <HI>Church</HI> doe <HI>right,</HI> or no. And <HI>thereby</HI> shall ye be able to <HI>reforme</HI> her, if she happen to do amiss. For it is possible the <HI>Church</HI> may erre; but it is <HI>not</HI> possible the <HI>Scriptures</HI> may erre. And the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of God have <HI>Authority</HI> to reforme the <HI>Church;</HI> but I never heard that the <HI>Church</HI> hath Authority to reforme the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> — To conclude (says he) like as the Errours of the <HI>Clocke</HI> be revealed by the constant Course of the <HI>Sunne;</HI> even so the Errours of the <HI>Church</HI> are revealed by the ever∣lasting and infallible <HI>Word</HI> of God.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> gives me Occasion, by what he says (<HI>p.</HI> 88.) to inquire of him, Whether he thinks he can <HI>as heartily joyn with</HI> this Rev. Protestant <HI>Father, as</HI> I <HI>do?</HI> And whether he will say, and how he can make it appear, that <HI>"These Passages are not at all inconsistent with his way of Reasoning"?</HI> And he gives me occasion to inquire of him also, Whether he thinks, when Bp. <HI>Jewel</HI> was for trying the Protestant Cause <HI>only</HI> by the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and so vehemently declin'd the Authority of the <HI>Fathers</HI> (not without some Reflections on their Memory, as sometimes <HI>very ill</HI> agreeing among themselves, and that about <HI>very weighty</HI> Matters, &amp;c.) the secret <HI>Reason</HI> at the Bottom was, <HI>"Because he was afraid of their Authority"?</HI> — That he was <HI>not</HI> so in Reality, is evident from his <HI>Controversial</HI> Pieces, against the <HI>Popish</HI> Opinions, which are full of Quotations from the <HI>Fa∣thers.</HI> The <HI>true</HI> Reason then must be, <HI>not</HI> because he distrust∣ed his Cause, and was <HI>afraid,</HI> but because he had a <HI>mean</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="003651_0101_10023CD847BB2428"/>Opinion, of <HI>the Authority of the Fathers</HI> in any important reli∣gious Disputes. He was upon <HI>Principle</HI> against TRADITION, as a <HI>uncertain, unsafe,</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI> thing, to be set up for a <HI>Rule</HI> in interpreting of Scripture. And therefore, when he controverts with the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctors on the Foot of <HI>Tradition,</HI> it is not to be understood as done of <HI>Choice,</HI> as thinking it the best Method to issue the Controversy; but only of <HI>Constraint,</HI> and with a View to quell their deceitful <HI>Vaunts</HI> of Antiquity, by beating them at their <HI>own Weapons▪</HI> Now just the same <HI>Principle</HI> and the same <HI>View</HI> are <HI>Protestant Dissenters</HI> govern'd by, in the Episcopal Controversies. If they decline the Au∣thority of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> it is because they think it contrary to the natural Fitness and Reason of Things, to refer a <HI>Divine</HI> Cause to <HI>human</HI> Arbitration, and set up a <HI>fallible Judge</HI> to determine for them in Matters of <HI>Conscience.</HI> However, they have sometimes submitted to contest the Points in Debate, on the Foot of <HI>Tradition,</HI> but then their principal View herein has been to <HI>confront</HI> their Adversaries, in the way of an <HI>Ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss to their avow'd Principles,</HI> commonly term'd <HI>Argumentum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minem:</HI> which is an Argument drawn from an <HI>indirect</HI> and <HI>insufficient Medium,</HI> it the Opinion of him that uses it, not af∣fecting the <HI>Merits</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Cause; but design'd chiefly to <HI>silence;</HI> the Opposer, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvince him that there is a <HI>Necessity</HI> of put∣ting the Dispute on a <HI>different</HI> Issue.— In this way much has been done, to baffle our Episcopal Adversaries, by a variety of Hands; who have exerted themselves to good Purpose, on one Occasion and another: Such as <HI>Owen, Baxter, Boyse, Pierce,</HI> and others among the Dissenters; <HI>Jameson, Lauder, Anderson,</HI> and others among the <HI>Scottish</HI> Ministers; with <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> and <HI>Edwards,</HI> among the Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines: Not to mention any Essays, that have been written in <HI>New England.</HI> All which Writers, if they don't prove, that we have the justest Pretensions to Antiquity for our Hypothesis, yet do demon∣strate thus much, That our Adversaries Boasts of "PLAIN <HI>Testimonies to the Divine Right of Episcopacy, as an Order superior to Presbytery,</HI> and of <HI>the Government of the Church by a Succession of Bishops from the Apostles</HI> being a NOTORIOUS, UNIVERSAL, and GLARING <HI>matter of Fact,</HI>" are but vain Boasts of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣guine Persons, that <HI>have not had Opportunity to ripen their S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dies in Antiquity,</HI> or <HI>have never had Impartiality enough to look</HI> into and examine Things as they ought. However, at least, the numerous Controversial Writings of so many <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>pious</HI> Men on both sides of the Question, must needs be allow'd
<PB N="68" REF="003651_0102_10023CC7ACCCA0C0"/>by modest Persons, certainly to demonstrate <HI>this,</HI> That it is <HI>a difficult Thing to come at the true Sense of the Fathers,</HI> even <HI>to an industrious and teachable Inquirer,</HI> and that it's next to impossible <HI>for unlearned Men to become acquainted with it;</HI> notwithstanding our <HI>Author</HI>'s Insinuations to the contrary, <HI>p.</HI> 87.— This Gen∣tleman observes (<HI>p.</HI> 91.) That <Q><HI>setting his</HI> Postulata <HI>aside</HI> (which shall be mention'd by'n'by) <HI>we may w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngle on upon</HI> SCRIPTURE <HI>without End: My Design in them</HI> (says he, to his Adversary, <HI>p.</HI> 92.) <HI>was to fix you, that we might come to a fair Stating of the Case, and bring the Matter to a short Issue: But that wou'd not serve your Turn; you was of the Mind to play a little longer upon the Identity of Names and Ambiguity of Words.</HI></Q> Now, for my part, I can't apprebend Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> cou'd have any other View himself than <HI>this,</HI> in diverting the Scent, and carrying us into the Wood of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> which is as full of Windings, and Darkness, and Ambiguity, as he can suppose the <HI>Scripture</HI> is; and therefore, for ought I see, he <HI>may wrangle on upon</HI> Fathers (as he says we may upon Scripture) <HI>without End,</HI> and notwithstanding his gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring Pretence of <HI>bringing the Matter to a short Issue</HI> by his <HI>Postulata, on which</HI> (he say) <HI>the Life of the Controversy as to Scripture,</HI> and I may add with equal Reason as to <HI>Fathers</HI> too, <HI>depends,</HI> he may wander these seven Years in the Mazes of Antiquity; and be never the nearer his <HI>short Issue.</HI> This will appear in the Sequel.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> IV. I propose now, under a distinct Head, to col∣lect and consider the more specious <HI>Pleas</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has offer'd, to justify his <HI>Appeal</HI> to the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and support the <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Tradition;</HI> which are deliver'd in the form of De∣clamation and Invective.</P>
<P>I observe, this Gentleman once and again makes doleful Outcries against us, as if by rejecting the Authority of the Fathers in the present Dispute we did a Thing, that <Q><HI>very much weakens the Common Cause of Christianity, destroys all historical Faith, shocks even the Scriptures themselves, and brings our Bibles into Contempt;</HI> as if therein we <HI>join'd with all the</HI> DEISTS <HI>and</HI> INFIDELS <HI>in the Kingdom,</HI> were <HI>serving their Turn, and justifying their Infidelity, or at least giving them a great Handle against us, to laugh at us, and ridicule our Religion</HI> &amp;c. (Compare <HI>pag.</HI> 72, 73, 80, 81.) Thus he <HI>sets us out in all the odious Colours he cou'd think of, and meerly riots upon our Infirmities,</HI> as if we were <HI>a Company of Knaves,
<PB N="69" REF="003651_0102_10023CC7ACCCA0C0"/>or a Pack of Fools. I am sure, any indifferent Person with half Eye may see, that herein he treats us injuriously.</HI></Q> Have we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> just Provocation to retort upon him, in his own Words (<HI>p.</HI> 81.) <Q>Why shou'd you thus delight to <HI>walk in the Counsel of the Ungodly, and sit in the Seat of the Scorner!</HI></Q> Do's Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> think to run us down with a <HI>railing Accusa∣tion,</HI> and to gain his Point by mere Dint of Slander! I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le Inclination to recriminate: or else I wou'd expostulate with him in his own Language <HI>(mutatis mutandis)</HI> <Q><HI>How comes it to pass, that</HI> PAPISTS <HI>are so mightily pleas'd to hear the Christian Fathers</HI> cry'd up for Oracles, <HI>by those who pre∣tend to be</HI> Protestants? <HI>Is it not because you are herein serving their Turn, and justifying their</HI> Conduct in laying aside the Scriptures, and in stead of them substituting the Fathers for their Guide in matters of Faith; <HI>or at least giving an Handle, to it! Methinks I should not love to be of their Company, in any thing that shou'd bring the Bible into Disgrace, and undermine it once the whole Foundation of</HI> the reformed Religion, <HI>as it seems to me</HI> an implicit Faith in the <HI>Fathers,</HI> as <HI>safe Witnesses, in what Sense the Apostles wou'd have themselves to be understood, has a Tendency to do.</HI> — But I forbear.</Q> And had rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sign this Gentleman to the Castigations of the learned CHIL∣LINGWORTH, for whose Judgment he has express'd a profound Respect. The Apostle thought it the best Expedient in dealing with the Men of <HI>Crete,</HI> to alledge against 'em their <HI>own</HI> Poet, whom he calls a <HI>Prophet:</HI> I propose to take the like Method, and may justly expect this Gentleman will submit to the Cor∣rection of his <HI>own</HI> Episcopal Author.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> says to his Adversary (<HI>p.</HI> 80.) <Q><HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣sure you, that I as tenaciously adhere to the holy Scriptures for my Rule, and the</HI> ONLY <HI>Rule of my Faith, as you or any one of your Persuasion whatsoever."</HI> But then he says (<HI>p.</HI> 59.) <HI>In doubtful Cases, it is my bounden Duty to follow the Footsteps of the Flock of Christ;</HI> that is, <HI>taking the primitive Church for a safe Witness, in what Sense the Apostles, wou'd have them∣selves understood,</HI> to chuse her as <HI>the best Guide to lead</HI> me <HI>to the Sense and Meaning of Scripture. This</HI> (says he <HI>p.</HI> 84.) <HI>is what we contend for.</HI></Q> And he tells his Adversary (<HI>p.</HI> 89.) <Q><HI>After all your Endeavours to deface the Fathers, I cannot part with my Rule;</HI></Q> i. e. to make them his Guide in interpreting doubtful places of Scripture.— Thus the Gentleman, I see, has learnt the exact Language of <HI>Rome:</HI> for that is the <HI>Popish</HI> Shibboleth, <HI>The Scripture a perfect Rule, yet not
<PB N="70" REF="003651_0103_10023CE5C96BFCC0"/>excluding Tradition;</HI> which they make come in as an <HI>Interpre∣ter of Obscurities in the Faith,</HI> and a necessary <HI>Guide to the Sense and Meaning of the Rule.</HI> 'Tis just the Talk of this Gentleman; <HI>The Scriptures his only</HI> RULE, <HI>and the Fathers his</HI> GUIDE <HI>in doubtful Cases.</HI></P>
<P>Now will he hear Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> and yield to his Cen∣sure! Turn to his learned Book of the <HI>Religion of Protestants</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 47.) Where, in Answer to the Popish Plea aforesaid, he thus delivers his Thoughts. Here <Q>we have direct <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys-play;</HI> a thing given with one hand, and taken away with the other.—<HI>We acknowledge</HI> (say you) <HI>Scripture to be a perfect Rule; — only we deny that it excludes unwritten Tra∣dition.</HI> As if you shou'd have said, We <HI>acknowledge</HI> it to be a perfect Rule,— only we <HI>deny</HI> it to be a perfect Rule. Either therefore you must revoke your Acknowledgement, or retract your Retraction of it; for both cannot possi∣bly stand together. For if you will stand to what you have granted, That <HI>Scripture is a perfect Rule;</HI>— you must then grant it both so <HI>Compleat,</HI> that it needs no <HI>Addition,</HI> and so EVIDENT, that it needs no INTERPRETATION: for both these Properties are requisite to a <HI>perfect Rule.</HI></Q> — It follows (<HI>p.</HI> 49.) <Q>When <HI>Protestants</HI> affirm against Papists, That <HI>Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith,</HI>— their Mean∣ing is, that the Scripture to them which presuppose it Di∣vine, and a Rule of Faith, as Papists and Protestants do, contains all the material Objects of Faith, is a <HI>compleat</HI> and <HI>total,</HI> and not onely an imperfect and a partial Rule.</Q> In the same page, he condemns the popish Doctrine of <HI>Traditions not excluded,</HI> as <Q>a DISPARAGEMENT to the Scripture's being a <HI>perfect Rule."</HI>— He has those Passages (<HI>p.</HI> 50.) "The <HI>Interpretations</HI> of obscure places of Scripture, which without question the <HI>Apostles</HI> taught the primitive Christians, are WHOLLY LOST; there remains no Certainty scarce of <HI>any one.</HI>— The <HI>Scripture</HI> is the <HI>only Rule</HI> to judge <HI>Con∣troversies</HI> by. Every Man is to judge for himself with the <HI>Judgment of Discretion</HI> &amp;c." He says elsewhere (<HI>p.</HI> 102.) We conceive, as the APOSTLES <HI>Persons,</HI> while they were living, were the only <HI>Judges</HI> of Controversies, so THEIR <HI>Writings,</HI> now they are dead, are the ONLY <HI>Rule</HI> for <HI>us</HI> to judge them by.</Q> Observe it, Here lies the Difference between our <HI>Layman</HI> and Mr. <HI>Chillingworth:</HI> The <HI>Layman</HI> says, The <HI>Scriptures</HI> are his <HI>only Rule</HI> of Faith; but in doubt∣ful Cases the <HI>Sense</HI> of the primitive <HI>Fathers</HI> must be his <HI>Guide.</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="003651_0103_10023CE5C96BFCC0"/>Whereas Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> in direct Opposition plainly says, The Scripture is the ONLY <HI>Rule</HI> to judge even CONTROVERSIES by, and that every Man is to judge <HI>for himself.</HI>— What without a <HI>Guide!</HI> Yes; for so says Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> (p. 51.) <Q>My Request is, that you will permit <HI>Scripture</HI> to have the Properties of a <HI>Rule;</HI> that is, to be <HI>fit</HI> to direct <HI>every one,</HI> that will make the best Use of it, to that <HI>End</HI> for which it was ordained: and that is as much as we need desire.

<P>Well, but Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> perhaps will say, "This is <HI>not at all inconsistent with my way of reasoning:</HI>" for I only speak of <HI>doubtful</HI> Cases, where we have <HI>not</HI> a <HI>plain Rule;</HI> there, I say, the <HI>Fathers must be my Guide.</HI> Now hear Mr. <HI>Chilling∣worth</HI> again (<HI>p.</HI> 74) <Q>If you speak of <HI>plain</HI> Places (and in <HI>such,</HI> ALL <HI>Things</HI> NECESSARY <HI>are contained,</HI> says he) we are sufficiently <HI>certain</HI> of the Meaning of them, neither need they any <HI>Interpreter.</HI> If of <HI>obscure</HI> and difficult Places, we confess we are <HI>uncertain</HI> of the Sense of many of them: But then, we say, there is no <HI>Necessity</HI> we should be <HI>certain.</HI> For if <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Will</HI> had been we shou'd have <HI>understood</HI> him more <HI>certainly,</HI> He wou'd have spoken more <HI>plainly.</HI></Q>— Up∣on which the Consequence naturally arises, It never was <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Will,</HI> that we shou'd take the <HI>Fathers</HI> for <HI>safe Witnesses</HI> to the Sense of Scripture, or authentick Interpreters of doubtful Places; and so their Belief and Practice, an authoriz'd Standard to all Posterity.— And whereas Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> says (<HI>p.</HI> 59.) <Q><HI>I shou'd</HI> EXTREMELY ENDANGER <HI>my self, if I forsake the ancient Paths, to follow new Devices,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

Now
<PB N="72" REF="003651_0104_10023CD24C5BB628"/>in the Points <HI>controverted</HI> among PROTESTANTS, he hath <HI>not so dealt</HI> with us; therefore he hath <HI>not</HI> laid any <HI>such Obligation</HI> upon us.

<P>Let it be added here: To set up the <HI>Fathers</HI> for Interpre∣ters of Scripture, from <HI>whose Sense</HI> we SHOULD <HI>not</HI> depart; however Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> may daub and disguise the matter by calling 'em only <HI>safe Witnesses</HI> to the Apostles Meaning; it is nevertheless in Effect to make their Traditions our <HI>Rule of Faith,</HI> to make them the <HI>Judges of Controversies</HI> in Religion, and advance 'em to the <HI>Papal</HI> Chair. <Q>To require, that <HI>their Interpretations</HI> of any <HI>Law of Christ</HI> should be <HI>obey'd,</HI> as the true and genuine, seem they to <HI>our</HI> Understanding never so dissonant from it, is to require indeed that <HI>their Interpretations</HI> should be the LAWS. 'Tis to make the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Lawmaker</HI> both mere STALES, and to set up the <HI>Interpreters</HI> in CHRIST'S stead: 'tis a <HI>Dethroning</HI> Christ from his Dominion over Mens <HI>Consciences,</HI></Q> and a making our selves the <HI>Servants of Men.</HI> To receive the Judgment of the Primi∣tive Church with an implicit Faith, is not to obey the <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ, but "only the <HI>Interpreter.</HI>" This is just <Q>as if I should pretend to submit to the Laws of the King of <HI>England,</HI> but should indeed resolve to obey them in <HI>that Sense</HI> which the King of <HI>France</HI> should put upon them, whatsoever it were;" in which Case, "I presume every understanding Man would say, that I did indeed <HI>obey</HI> the King of <HI>France,</HI> and not the King of <HI>England.</HI></Q> These are the Thoughts of Mr. CHILLINGWORTH.

<P>Well, but Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> perhaps will say; If there be no absolute <HI>Obligation</HI> to receive Traditional Interpretations, yet at least you must allow the Fathers to be <Q><HI>the safest and best Guides</HI> to the Sense of Scripture in doubtful Cases, as being <HI>under much better Advantages not to mistake, than we at this Distance.</HI></Q> I have said something to this before: But now let Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> speak. (See his Book, <HI>p.</HI> 137.) <Q>Who can doubt but the <HI>primitive</HI> Christians, to whom the Epistles of the <HI>Apostles</HI> were written, either of themselves understood, or were instructed by the Apostles touching the Sense of the <HI>obscure</HI> places of them? These TRADITIVE <HI>Interpretations,</HI> had they been <HI>written</HI> and <HI>dispersed,</HI> as the <HI>Scriptures</HI> were, had without question been <HI>preserved,</HI> as the Scriptures are: But to shew how excellent a KEEPER of the <HI>Tradition,</HI> the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath been, or even the CATHOLICK <HI>Church,</HI> for want of writing <HI>They are</HI> ALL LOST, nay, were lost within a <HI>few</HI> Ages after Christ: So that if we consult the ANCIENT <HI>Interpreters</HI> [N.

If so, this at once destroys the Credit of Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s SAFE WITNESSES and BEST GUIDES. And pray, <HI>who</HI> is't now that reflects on the <HI>Catholic Church,</HI> and ex∣poses the <HI>good old Fathers,</HI> as if there were <HI>no Faith in what they say!</HI> Where's the <HI>glorious</HI> UNITY, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> boasts of, among the primitive Fathers; and on which <HI>the Authority of those venerable Martyrs and Confessors</HI> so depends! You see, they are not only <HI>"some of our Persuasion"</HI> (as he insinuates, <HI>p.</HI> 72.) that undervalue the Authority of ancient Interpretations and Traditions. No, we have the good Company of some of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Persuasion: the great CHILLINGWORTH, for In∣stance. And if we shou'd represent the Fathers as being some of 'em "<HI>ignorant Men,</HI> or <HI>guilty of pious Frauds,</HI>" neither shou'd we be alone in this. For hear what the Episcopal Mr. <HI>Sprint</HI> says, (<HI>Necess. of Conform.</HI> p. 91.) <Q>Touching the <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> of the Church, some being <HI>simple,</HI> and of small Capacitie, and shallow Judgment, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> saith, receiv∣ed <HI>Traditions</HI> without any <HI>searching</HI> of Writings, as out of <HI>bare Report.</HI> Such one was <HI>Papias,</HI> the hearer of St. <HI>John,</HI> and Companion of <HI>Policarp,</HI> who in this <HI>Simplicity</HI> broached <HI>fabulous</HI> Doctrine of the <HI>Chiliast</HI> Error: by whom <HI>Irenaeus,</HI>

For, by the way, I must observe, even <HI>he</HI> takes upon him to use a pretty deal of Freedom with the <HI>good old Fathers,</HI> in the midst of his apologetical Harangue; particularly in conceding, that some of the <HI>"erroneous Tenets"</HI> held by them may pass for "VERY BAD <HI>Mistakes,</HI>" and that they might be MISLED <HI>into them;</HI>" That they <Q><HI>might fall into unjustifiable</HI> BROILS and <HI>Contentions about</HI> SMALL <HI>and circumstantial Matters;</HI></Q> That <Q><HI>particular Churches might have</HI> DIFFERENT <HI>Usages, for which they might</HI> ZEALOUSLY <HI>and perhaps</HI> TRULY <HI>plead Apostolical Tradition</HI></Q> &amp;c.

Or if they might TRULY plead <HI>opposite</HI> apostolic Traditions to support contrary Practices, this infers a gross Reflection (as upon the English <HI>Act of</HI> UNIFORMITY, which at this rate may pass for an <HI>unapostolical</HI> and unnecessary Act; so in special) on those primitive <HI>Fathers,</HI> who with so much unchristian Heat contended for <HI>Uniformity,</HI> in small Matters, even to <HI>Excommunication</HI> of such as differ'd from them. And then, might any of the venerable Fathers fall into VERY BAD <HI>Mistakes,</HI> and <HI>be</HI> MISLED <HI>into 'em too;</HI> what a Reflection is this upon them, as <HI>ignorant Men,</HI> and of weak Capacity!

<P>I fix then on what he calls <Q><HI>the</HI> CHILIAST <HI>Notion, of Christ's personal Reign with the Saints on Earth, a thousand Years</HI></Q> &amp;c.

It seems, some learned <HI>Episcopal</HI> Antiquaries are of another Mind▪ For what is that, we read in Dr. EDWARDS'S <HI>Discourse concerning the Fathers!</HI> (Remains, <HI>p.</HI> 28.) <Q>The Tradition concerning the <HI>Millennium,</HI> i. e. the personal Reigning of Christ upon Earth a thousand Years &amp;c. was derived from St. <HI>John,</HI> if we will believe <HI>Papias,</HI> one of the Ancients, a Disciple of St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist.

<PB N="77" REF="003651_0106_10023CDD50186838"/>this Opinion was grounded on <HI>such Authority,</HI> it be∣came the GENERAL and UNIVERSAL <HI>Belief</HI> of the Christi∣ans that came afterwards, yea, of the <HI>most</HI> EMINENT of the <HI>Fathers."</HI>—So Bishop MORTON (<HI>Prot. Appeal.</HI> p. 510.) The Error of the <HI>Millenarit</HI> (says he) our Adversaries have acknowledged to have been both ancient and GENERAL, and defended by primitive Fathers, and that without either <HI>notorious Beginning</HI> or <HI>public Resistance.</HI>" And he tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 664.) "The Error of the <HI>Chiliasts</HI> continued THREE HUNDRED Years;</Q> that is, successively from the time of <HI>Papias,</HI> who was contemporary with the Apostle <HI>John.</HI> (<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 324.)—So Archbishop TILLOTSON (Fol. Vol. 1. p. 730.) observes, <Q>The Tradition of the <HI>Chiliasts</HI> was the Persuasion of ALL orthodox Christians in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s Time;</Q> who flourish'd in the middle of the <HI>2d</HI> Century.— Now, it may be, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will return upon me, These Passages give us only the Opinion of the <HI>Moderns</HI> on the Case: But my Demand was, <Q>Is the <HI>Chiliast</HI>-Notion <HI>asserted by any of the Fathers</HI> themselves to have been the <HI>universal Doctrine in those Days?</HI></Q> Well, to this the Answer is still <HI>affirma∣tive.</HI> The Mouth of <HI>two Witnesses</HI> may suffice, for Evidence, both of which liv'd in the next Age after the Apostles. I shall take my Account from Mr. CHILLINGWORTH. (<HI>Relig. Prot.</HI> p. 309.) <Q>It appears manifestly out of this Book of IRENAEUS (Lib. 3. <HI>adv Haer.</HI>) that the Doctrine of the <HI>Chiliasts</HI> was in <HI>his</HI> Judgment <HI>Apostolique</HI> Tradition, <HI>as also</HI> it was <HI>esteemed</HI> (for ought appears to the Contrary) by ALL the <HI>Doctors,</HI> and <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Martyrs</HI> of or about <HI>his</HI> Time; for ALL that spake of it, or whose Judgments in the point are any way recorded, are <HI>for</HI> it: and JUSTIN MARTYR (In Dial. cum <HI>Tryphon.</HI>) professeth, that ALL <HI>good and orthodox Christians of his Time believed it;</HI> and those that did not, he reckons among <HI>Heretiques.</HI></Q> Will any one now deny, the Doctrine was <HI>universal!</HI></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has another Question behind; <HI>Did any of the Fathers plead for the</HI> Chiliast <HI>Notion as an</HI> ESSENTIAL <HI>Doc∣trine of Christianity?</HI> I answer, <HI>Judge you</HI> by the Account of <HI>Justin</HI> above given: He manifestly esteem'd it a Doctrine of such Importance, That <HI>those who did not believe it, he reckon'd a∣mong</HI> HERETICKS. I shall add, in the Words of <HI>A. Bp.</HI> TIL∣LOTSON (<HI>Vol.</HI> 1. p. 732.) <Q>It is not material to my Purpose, whether or no <HI>Justin</HI> look'd upon this as a Point <HI>necessary</HI> to Salvation, so long as it is evident that he looked upon it
<PB N="78" REF="003651_0107_10023CD3F5E8ACA8"/>as a <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> and Part of the <HI>Christian Doctrine.</HI> And yet, it seems, he thought it a Point of <HI>more than ordinary</HI> Importance, because he joyns it with the Doctrine of the RESURRECTION, and says that it was <HI>not disowned by any but those who also denied the Resurrection.</HI></Q> He expresly says of the Disowners of this Doctrine, <Q>Of <HI>these</HI> who are called indeed Christians, but are <HI>atheistical</HI> and <HI>impious Hereticks,</HI> I have shewed, that they teach in all Points blasphemous, atheistical and absurd Things &amp;c. (<HI>Dial.</HI> cum. <HI>Tryph.</HI> p. 306. Edit. <HI>Lut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> 1615.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears, the Doctrine of the <HI>Millennium</HI> was in <HI>Justin</HI>'s time <HI>Universally</HI> believ'd by the Orthodox, and held to be <HI>Apostolical,</HI> and such as deny'd it deem'd <HI>Heretical.</HI> Upon the whole take this Observation, in the <HI>Archbishop's</HI> Words (<HI>p.</HI> 730.) <Q>If notwithstanding the <HI>Persuasion</HI> of <HI>that Age,</HI> that this Doctrine was descended to them from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> it was <HI>not</HI> really so descended; Then the <HI>Persuasion</HI> of Christians in <HI>any</HI> Age, that a Doctrine was brought down to them from the Apostles, is no <HI>Demonstration</HI> that it was so. —The natural <HI>Consequence</HI> (of the <HI>Premises</HI>) is this (says he) That the Mistake of ONE <HI>simple</HI> and <HI>credulous</HI> Man may in an Age or two give Occasion to the <HI>universal</HI> Enter∣tainment of a Doctrine, <HI>as</HI> descended down to them from <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> when there was <HI>no such Matter.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Apply this now to the Point in Controversy, the Case of <HI>E∣piscopacy.</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 90.) says, "<HI>he thinks it</HI> HARD, <HI>if we can't allow, that the</HI> Fathers <HI>knew whether the Church was govern'd by Bishops, or not.</HI>" I must confess, it seems so: but then it must be added, We think it <HI>hard</HI> too, if we mayn't be allow'd to judge, whether the Fathers <HI>do testify,</HI> in fact, the Church was govern'd by Bishops, or not. And supposing the Fathers do testify in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> we think it <HI>hard</HI> again, if we mayn't be allow'd to judge, whether the Bishops of the primitive Church were of the same <HI>Spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> with those in the modern Church, or not And if it shou'd appear, that in the <HI>3d</HI> or 4th Age they were the same, yet we think it still <HI>hard,</HI> we mayn't be allow'd to judge, whether these Bishops were then held to be of <HI>Divine</HI> Right, or not: And if of Divine Right, whether they founded their Opinion upon <HI>Scripture,</HI> or <HI>Tradi∣tion.</HI> Now if they built upon <HI>Scripture,</HI> we think it <HI>hard,</HI> that their Opinion shou'd be urg'd as a Rule to us, and that we mayn't be allow'd to see with our own Eyes, and judge for our selves on the Sense of Scripture. But, if upon <HI>Tradition,</HI> then
<PB N="79" REF="003651_0107_10023CD3F5E8ACA8"/>think it <HI>hard</HI> again, to be born down with an Authority, that has so many just Prejudices lying against it. As Dr. STIL∣LINGFLEET says (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 317.) <Q>How can we fix upon the Testimony of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> as any thing <HI>certain</HI> or <HI>impartial</HI> in this Case; when it hath been found so <HI>evidently</HI> PARTIAL in a Case of <HI>less</HI> Concernment, than this is! A <HI>Witness,</HI> that hath once <HI>betrayed</HI> his <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in the open Court, will HARDLY have his <HI>Evidence</HI> taken in a Case of Mo∣ment, especially when the Cause must stand or fall according to his single Testimony. For my part (says the Dr.) I see not how any Man, that would see <HI>Reason</HI> for what he doth, can <HI>adhere</HI> to the Church for an unquestionable <HI>Tradition</HI> received from the <HI>Apostles;</HI> WHEN in the Case of keeping <HI>Easter</HI> (a Case wherein they had all the Advan∣tages imaginable, in order to knowing the Certainty of the Thing in question among them) there was yet so much <HI>un∣reasonable Heat</HI> shewed on both sides, and such <HI>Confidence</HI> that on either side their Tradition was <HI>Apostolical:</HI></Q> I add, WHEN in the Case of the <HI>Chiliast</HI>-Notion, there was the fairest Appearance of an <HI>authentick</HI> Tradition from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> some Texts of <HI>Scripture</HI> seeming to <HI>favour</HI> the Opinion, a very <HI>early</HI> Entertainment of it, an <HI>universal</HI> Suffrage for it, and a <HI>long</HI> Duration thereof thro' the Course of Three Centuries (all which <HI>flagrantly appears matter of fact</HI>) yet all this while, if we may believe the Church in Ages following (for at present I am not concern'd to deliver my own private Thoughts on the Subject) the <HI>Millenary</HI> Opinion was <HI>erroneous,</HI> and the Tradition has been almost as universally condemn'd for <HI>Apocryphal,</HI> as once it was receiv'd for <HI>Canonical.</HI> Now, why may not we suppose, the Tradition pleaded in behalf of the distinct Order and the Divine Right of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> has as little of Truth in its Foundation? <Q>This Notion being once started (as Dr. <HI>Ca∣lamy</HI> observes, <HI>Mod Non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> I. 181.) the Fathers may be easily suppos'd to have taken it <HI>from one another,</HI> as they did the <HI>Chiliastical</HI> Opinion; while yet there might not be any better Ground to ascribe it to an <HI>Apostolical</HI> Original, than there was as to that Opinion which prevail'd so generally for several Centuries</Q> If Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will not allow the <HI>Suffrage</HI> of the primitive Church to be a solid Proof in one Case; I think I may with equal Modesty refuse it in the other: Especially since I find one of his own <HI>Episcopal</HI> Au∣thors crying up the Tradition in this Case of <HI>Chylias<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and in one other Case, as being most probable, next to that of the
<PB N="80" REF="003651_0108_10023D13F6709988"/>Canon of Scripture, and this alone excepted, without a Rival. The famous Mr. CHILLINGWORTH (<HI>p.</HI> 102.) has these words; <Q>The <HI>Apostles</HI> Writings are the <HI>only</HI> Rule for us to judge <HI>Con∣troversies</HI> by; There being NOTHING <HI>unwritten,</HI> which can go in upon <HI>half so fair Cards,</HI> for the Title of <HI>Apostolike</HI> Tradition, as these Things, which by the Confession of both sides are <HI>not</HI> so: I mean <HI>the Doctrine of the</HI> MILLE∣NARIES, and <HI>of the Necessity of the Eucharist for Infants.</HI></Q> Again, hear what he says (<HI>p.</HI> 136.) <Q>To deal ingenuously with You and the World, I am not such an Idolater of S. <HI>Austin,</HI> as to think all his Sentences are Oracles; and par∣ticularly in this thing, that whatsoever was practised or held by the <HI>universal</HI> Church of <HI>his</HI> Time, must needs have come from the <HI>Apostles.</HI> Though, considering the <HI>Nearness</HI> of his Time to the Apostles, I think it a good probable Way, and therefore am apt enough to follow it, when I see no Reason to the contrary. Yet, I profess, I must have better Satis∣faction, before I can induce my self to hold it <HI>certain;</HI>— because by the Church <HI>universal</HI> of some Time, and the Church <HI>universal</HI> of other Times, I see plain <HI>Contradictions</HI> held and practised: Both which could not come from the <HI>Apostles;</HI> for then the Apostles had been Teachers of <HI>Fals∣hood.</HI>—I instance in the Doctrine of the <HI>Millenaries,</HI> and the Eucharist's Necessity for <HI>Infants:</HI> both which Doctrines have been taught by the CONSENT of the eminent <HI>Fathers</HI> of some Ages, without any <HI>Opposition</HI> from any of their Contempo∣raries; and were delivered by them, not as <HI>Doctors,</HI> but as WITNESSES, not as their own Opinions, but as APOSTO∣LICK <HI>Traditions:</HI> — And <HI>(yet)</HI> that the contrary Doc∣trines were <HI>Catholique</HI> at some other Time, I believe you will not think it needful for me to prove.</Q></P>
<P>So again (<HI>p.</HI> 261.) <Q>Though some Protestants confess some of your Doctrine is <HI>Ancient:</HI> yet this is <HI>Nothing,</HI> so long as it is evident, even by the Confession of all Sides, that <HI>many Errors,</HI> I instance in that of the <HI>Millenaries,</HI> and the Commu∣nicating of <HI>Infants,</HI> were more ancient. Not any Antiquity therefore, unless it be <HI>Absolute</HI> and <HI>Primitive,</HI> is a certain Sign of true Doctrine.</Q> (See also CHILL. <HI>Answ. to Pref. p.</HI> 11.)</P>
<P>This now, I think, subverts the Foundation of Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI>'s Argument from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> in the case of <HI>Episcopacy:</HI> and particularly invalidates the Argument <HI>a Minori,</HI> which he so insists upon in both Letters; I mean, his Objection from
<PB N="81" REF="003651_0108_10023D13F6709988"/><HI>parallel</HI> Cases, in which (he says) we plead the Sense and Practice of Antiquity, to support our Opinion, and yet (says he) <Q><HI>the Testimonies of the primitive Church in those Cases are not so ancient, clear and frequent, as for interpreting of Scripture in favour of Episcopacy.</HI>" Particularly he says (<HI>p</HI> 69.) "<HI>We have much more ancient, clear and frequent Testimonies, in favour of Episcopacy, than can be produced in the Cause of</HI> Infant-Bap∣tisme: <HI>For there is no Father</HI> (says he) <HI>that gives a full clear and incontestible Testimony for</HI> Infant Baptisme, <HI>before St.</HI> Cy∣prian, <HI>who lived</HI> 150 <HI>Years after the Apostles</HI></Q> &amp;c. Well now, supposing this to be Fact, I ask the Gentleman, whether he thinks the Authority of <HI>Cyprian</HI> and the Church in his day, to be a sufficient Ground for interpreting doubtful Texts of Scripture in favour of <HI>Infant Baptism,</HI> and for refelling those <HI>Arguments against it,</HI> to be bro't out of Scripture, which he says (<HI>p.</HI> 68.) are <HI>"as strong, as any we can bring against Episco∣pacy?"</HI> To this, if he will be consistent with himself, he must answer in the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> — But then again I must observe, if he will be still consistent with himself, he must also think, the Authority of <HI>Cyprian</HI> and the Church in his Day is a sufficient Ground for interpreting the Scripture in favour of <HI>Communi∣cating Infants:</HI> which yet I trust Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will allow to be an <HI>Error,</HI> but I hope will not number it among his <Q>LITTLE TRIFLING <HI>Instances</HI> of Mistakes and Errors.</Q></P>
<P>I think proper to take a particular Notice of it, tho' he omits it in his Catalogue of <HI>"worst Things."</HI> <Q>That Infants were ad∣mitted to the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Supper</HI> in those early Ages of the Church, is known to all that are acquainted with Ecclesiastical History,</Q> says an anonymous Episcopal Writer. (LIVES <HI>of the primitive Fathers, p.</HI> 592.) He adds (<HI>p.</HI> 607.) <Q>That it was so in the <HI>third</HI> Century, appears by the Account St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> gives us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — And that this was not only practis'd in St. <HI>Austin</HI>'s time, but also deem'd <HI>necessary to the Salvation of Infants,</HI> as well as Baptism, is manifest by what he tells us in his first Book, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— The Practice continued to the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great at the Beginning of the <HI>9th</HI> Century; as is prov'd by Bp. TAYLOR, in his Treatise call'd, <HI>The worthy Commu∣nicant.</HI> Ch. 3. §. 2.</Q>— Bp. MORTON (<HI>Prot. Appeal.</HI> p. 510.) observes, That this Practice <Q>continued in the Church for 600 Years; the <HI>first Author,</HI> or <HI>visible Resister</HI> whereof (says he) our Adversaries cannot name in continuance of <HI>so many hundred Years.</HI></Q> I shall add that of Mr. CHILLINGWORTH, (<HI>Answ.</HI> to <HI>Pref.</HI> p. 11.) <Q><HI>S. Augustine,</HI> I am sure, held the <HI>Commu∣nicating
<PB N="82" REF="003651_0109_10023CE848EABAE8"/>of Infants</HI> as much <HI>Apostolique</HI> Tradition, as the <HI>Baptizing</HI> them. So again, he says (<HI>p.</HI> 135.) "It was a Practice of the whole Church in S. <HI>Austine's</HI> time, and e∣steemed an <HI>Apostolique</HI> Tradition, even by S. <HI>Austine</HI> him∣self, <HI>That the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>charist should be administred to Infants:</HI> Tell me, Sir, I beseech you (says he to his Adversary) Had it been insolent Madness to dispute against this Practice, or had it not? If it <HI>had,</HI> how insolent and mad are <HI>you,</HI> that have not only disputed against it, but utterly <HI>abolyshed</HI> it?</Q> — I will supply the other part of the Dilemma, and say; If it had <HI>not,</HI> then how intolerably <HI>partial</HI> and abusive are you, to plead that Authority for <HI>Infant-Baptism,</HI> or in any Case, which you scruple not your self to reject in the Case of <HI>In∣fant-Communicating,</HI> and in many other Cases?—How weak and simple too, to build on an Authority, as a <HI>certain</HI> or <HI>safe</HI> Ground for Belief, which may support <HI>Falshood,</HI> as well as Truth? — If Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will not be try'd by <HI>Austin</HI>'s Judgment, who (according to the Episcopal way of arguing) must needs be allow'd to know well enough, what was the Opinion and Practice of the Church in an Age or two before him, I know not why he should plead the Authority of <HI>Cyprian:</HI> Or if he will not submit to the Authority of <HI>Cyprian</HI> in one Case, I think he unqualifies himself to plead it in any other. If the <HI>Communicating of Infants</HI> was a Custom of the Church in the <HI>Cyprianick</HI> Age, and held to be of <HI>Apostolick</HI> Original, and of <HI>necessity</HI> to Salvation, as it certainly was by <HI>Austin,</HI> and probably by <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and all the Doctors for those 600 Years in which it is known to have been practised; How can Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> consistently to himself, disown that ancient Usage! What! (to turn upon him his own Argument (<HI>p.</HI> 86.) <Q><HI>Were all those Fathers a Pack of Knaves, that he should have no Faith in what they say! Would he be willing to be treated so himself! Nay, Do's he treat the Heathen Historians so inju∣riously! Why then must the poor Christian Fathers be disbelieved!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Or how can he reject the <HI>Chiliast</HI> Notion, as an Error, when it was so <HI>early</HI> receiv'd, as <HI>Apostolical,</HI> and held as a matter of <HI>Faith</HI> for the Space of <HI>three Centuries:</HI> and yet at the same Time urge those very Considerations in favour of his beloved Episcopacy! I will return Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> his own Argument, (<HI>p.</HI> 69.) apply'd to <HI>this</HI> Case. <Q>If <HI>the Fathers of the first and best Ages are on the Side of the</HI> CHILIAST Opinion (as we have been told they are) <HI>I can't with all the Witts I have, devise, Why the Witness of the Fathers of the primitive Church
<PB N="83" REF="003651_0109_10023CE848EABAE8"/>should not as well be called in, and be allowed as good Evidence, to justify our interpreting the Scriptures, in favour of</HI> the CHYLIAST Doctrine, <HI>as of Episcopacy;</HI> Especially seeing <HI>we have much more ancient, clear, and frequent Testimonies of the primitive Church, for interpreting of Scripture in favour of</HI> Chyliasm, than <HI>can be produced in the Cause</HI> of the Divine Right and fundamental Necessity of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> as an Or∣der superior to Presbytery: <HI>For there is no Father, that gives a full clear and incontestible Testimony for this,</HI> at least <HI>before St.</HI> CYPRIAN (if we shou'd allow that he do's it) <HI>who lived</HI> 150 <HI>Years after the Apostles. Whereas how clear and full in the Cause of</HI> Chyliasm <HI>is</HI> IRENAEUS, <HI>who lived in the very next Age to them; and</HI> JUSTIN MARTYR, who liv'd and wrote an hundred Years before <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and but fifty after St. <HI>John,</HI> the last surviving Apostle; and above all, PAPIAS, <HI>who lived in the Apostles Times,</HI> and said he receiv'd the <HI>Chyliasti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Tradition from the Mouth of the Apostle <HI>John</HI> himself! So <HI>full and express is the whole Cur∣rent of Antiquity,</HI> in favour of <HI>Chyliasm, that it seems to me</HI> (according to Mr. <HI>Layman's</HI> way of thinking) <HI>that</HI> NO HONEST <HI>Man can question, but that it had the universal Witness of the Church of God, even from the Beginning:</HI> and yet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> ventures to rank this Notion among the <HI>Errors</HI> of the Fathers. <HI>For which Reason, I can't help being persuaded, that there never was a Time in the primitive Church,</HI> for some Centuries after the Apostles, <HI>but that if</HI> Mr. Layman <HI>had lived in it, and obstinately persisted in his</HI> Anti-Chyliast <HI>Opinion, he would have been ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sured and cast out of the universal Church, for a</HI> HERETIC, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I have exactly follow'd the Gentleman's Train of Reasoning: and now, whether it be thought Logick, or So∣phistry, I'm sure the Argument is as pertinent to my Case, and as good in my Application of it, as in Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s. Yea, I have not merely quitted with him, but he fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s in my Debt: for I have this great <HI>Advantage</HI> above him, that the Idea of <HI>Chyliasm</HI> has been settled and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>form; whereas the Notion of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> has been various and indeterminate. <HI>Bishop</HI> is an equivocal Word; acknowledged by Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> to be pro∣miscuously us'd in Scripture, and in <HI>Clemens,</HI> the first Christian Writer: and it is very disputable, whether it was not so us'd, by all the Writers of the <HI>2d</HI> Century at least: So that, al∣lowing the Fathers do assert the Divine Right of <HI>Bishops,</HI> yet (in them there may be only the <HI>Nomen,</HI> not the <HI>Sensus Neminis,</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="003651_0110_10023CEA0BDA2630"/>according to modern Conceptions of Episcopacy; and) the Possibility of their meaning only <HI>Parochial</HI> Bishops do's exceed∣ingly weaken the Argument from primitive Testimonies, for the Divine Right of <HI>Diocesan</HI> Prelates. Whereas now the <HI>Chy∣liasm</HI> of the Ancients has a known fix'd and unvarying Idea; So that here the Fathers Testimonies are in a <HI>plain</HI> Case: which Consideration must necessarily cast the Balance in fa∣vour of <HI>my</HI> Point, and give a greater Weight and Force to Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Argument as I apply it, than as he uses it. The confessed Ambiguity of the word <HI>Bishop,</HI> makes his Argument against me possibly a mere <HI>Fallacy:</HI> Nevertheless the same Argument, as I use it against him, he must grant to be cer∣tain <HI>Demonstration;</HI> being in a Case where there's no such Ambiguity acknowleg'd. But still with what Logick or with what Charity, the harsh <HI>Conclusion,</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has dictated to me, may be drawn, I must leave with indifferent Judges to say. My Design was only an <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem;</HI> and it's well if it don't prove an <HI>Argumentum ad Ignorantiam,</HI> beyond Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Skill to refute, without destroying his own Cause at the same time.</P>
<P>After all, it may be, our <HI>Lay-Adversary</HI> will tell me, I have been arguing only in the <HI>Evasive</HI> Way, and that he expected I wou'd speak more directly to the Point, in refuting his grand Charge against us, as <HI>joyning with</HI> DEISTS <HI>and</HI> INFI∣DELS, <HI>destroying all historical Faith, and shocking even the Scrip∣tures themselves,</HI> while we reject the Testimony of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in favour of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> which (as he says) hath as good Evi∣dence from human Testimony, as the CANON OF SCRIPTURE. His Words are (<HI>p.</HI> 72.) <Q><HI>I know of no external Evidence of the Canon of the Scriptures, besides the Testimony of the Church. What Evidence, for Instance, have we, that the Epistle of St.</HI> James, <HI>or Revelation of St</HI> John, <HI>were written by the Apostles, whose Names they bear, and were receiv'd for canonical Scripture, besides the Testimony of those very Men, who are likewise Witnesses to the Apostolical and Divine Original of</HI> Episcopal <HI>Government?— And</HI> (he says <HI>p.</HI> 81.) "<HI>if they are not to be depended upon, when they bear Testimony to</HI> Episcopacy, <HI>why shou'd we depend on them,</HI> when they bear <HI>Testimony to the Canon of Scripture?</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the Argument, that embolden'd the Gentleman to <HI>fall foul of</HI> his <HI>good old</HI> Friends and <HI>Fathers,</HI> as <HI>joyning with all the Deists and Infidels in the Kingdom, to bring the Bible into Disgrace, by treating the primitive Fathers with so much Con∣tempt.</HI> But, upon the calmest Consideration it appears to me
<PB N="85" REF="003651_0110_10023CEA0BDA2630"/>at best only an <HI>Argumentum ad Passiones,</HI> an Address to the Readers Passions, rather than their Judgment; or in <HI>Eu∣sebius's</HI> Dialect, an Argument adapted to <HI>move People's Af∣fections to outrun their Reason.</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> it seems, was re∣solv'd to do Business; and therefore, to alarm Men's Fears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e couples <HI>Dissenters</HI> and <HI>Deists</HI> together, and puts <HI>Christianity</HI> and <HI>Episcopacy</HI> on the same foot, both to stand or fall toge∣ther. If he can't convince the rational Inquirer, he'll try to stumble the Ignorant, to scare the Credulous, and cheat the Unwary into <HI>his</HI> Belief, by terrible and odious Represen∣tations of <HI>our</HI> Opinion. Sure he has drank at <HI>Lesly</HI>'s Cistern, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ckt up <HI>Dodwel</HI>'s Vomit, whom Bp. <HI>Burnet</HI> scrupled not to call <HI>the Corrupter of our Faith and Church.</HI> His Declamatory Strains on this Occasion exhibit the true Reveries of those <HI>non-juring Schismaticks,</HI> that have been wont to supply by <HI>Rant,</HI> what they wanted of Reason, and to scatter their <HI>spiritual Ter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> over the Nation, when they could not by rational Argu∣ments support a sinking Cause. But let us a little consider the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mendous Objection: and I doubt not, it will appear to every intelligent Reader transparent Sophistry. The following Re∣marks may suffice to guard our Cause against so weak an Attack.</P>
<P>I observe, first, The Gentleman argues upon an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> which he knows we cannot grant him; That the primitive <HI>Fathers</HI> do, in fact, bear their <HI>Testimony</HI> to <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> in his Acceptation of it. We don't deny (as we judge) the primi∣tive Episcopacy; but only that of the modern Stamp, which we think a Stranger to the best and purest Antiquity. Here then Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> is guilty of the Sophism, call'd <HI>Petitio Prin∣tipii.</HI> He charges us as being in a Confederacy with <HI>Deists</HI> (to bring the Scriptures into Disgrace, which have no other ex∣ternal Evidence (says he) but the Testimony of the Fathers) <HI>Because</HI> we reject the <HI>Testimony</HI> which the Fathers bear to <HI>Dio∣cesan</HI> Episcopacy: Whereas it is one great Point in Contest, whether the Fathers <HI>do</HI> give their Attestation to <HI>this Species</HI> of Episcopacy. We dispute it: but do's our rejecting <HI>his</HI> Con∣struction of the Fathers, prove our <HI>treating them with Con∣tempt!</HI> It's true, we cannot but have a hearty Contempt for the <HI>Pretended</HI> Testimonies from the Fathers, alledg'd in the Cause of Diocesan Episcopacy, as wholly <HI>impertinent:</HI> and yet at the same time we may highly honour their <HI>Real</HI> Testimo∣nies to the Canon of Scripture.</P>
<P>But then, admitting the Fathers probably speak of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> in Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Acceptation of it, will he (dare he!) pretend,
<PB N="86" REF="003651_0111_10023CF88F76FC00"/>that the Testimonies in that Case are as <HI>full</HI> and <HI>unanimous, clear</HI> and <HI>strong,</HI> as for the Canon of Scripture? Is the Tradi∣tion sufficiently testify'd to be universal, original and un∣interrupted, in one Case, as well as the other? If not, 'tis no criminal Partiality, nor any Contempt of the Fathers, to reject a <HI>defective</HI> Testimony, while we accept their fuller and clearer Suffrage in another Case.</P>
<P>But then again, supposing that the <HI>Fathers</HI> had given the <HI>fullest</HI> and <HI>plainest</HI> Testimonies to Episcopacy, as to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s <HI>Existence</HI> in their Day; yet what Evidence would that afford of an un∣interrupted <HI>Succession</HI> of Bishops to this Day? Without which, I doubt, our Author's Cause will finally miscarry, and his Argument signify just nothing. According to the common Doctrine of our Adversaries, all that are not in the true <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> of Succession from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> are but <HI>Lay-Impostors:</HI> And now will he pretend, that there is as good Evidence of an <HI>unbroken Line</HI> of Bishops, and Presbyters Episcopally ordain'd, as we have of genuine and true Scriptures! How easy a mat∣ter were it, for particular Churches to be impos'd upon with forged Orders, or uncanonical Consecrations; whereby the Line would certainly be violated! But how impossible were it, to obtrude a false Bible on the whole Church of God! And when some have attempted to forge Books of Scripture and father 'em on some Apostle, how easily has the Cheat been detected! Now, that in Fact there have been repeated Brea∣ches of regular Succession, seems to be past all Controversy. Bishop HOADLY (<HI>Preserv.</HI> p. 78.) observes; <Q>This <HI>regular uninterrupted Succession</HI> of Persons qualified and regularly or∣dained, is a matter <HI>impossible</HI> to be proved: Nay, the <HI>Con∣trary</HI> is more than probable, upon all <HI>historical Evidence.</HI></Q> But that we have the true Canon of Scripture, I hope, Mr <HI>Lay∣man</HI> will allow to be capable of Demonstration by the best historical and rational Evidence A Succession of true Bibles is a thousand times more evident, than a Succession of true Bishops. And to insinuate, that we have no surer Evidence of genuine Scriptures, than can be produced for a right Line of Episcopacy, verily it is one of the <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yest Lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> upon Christianity, that can easily be imagined.</P>
<P>But then further, supposing this Line of Succession demon∣strable, even up to the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and that they are full and clear in their Testimonies for Episcopacy, as <HI>universal matter of Fact</HI> in their Times; yet he that argues from Fact to <HI>Right</HI> in this Case, is a mere Sophister: For this is to suppose an Im∣possibility
<PB N="87" REF="003651_0111_10023CF88F76FC00"/>of <HI>Innovations</HI> in the primitive Church, or at least a Certainty of their Freedom from <HI>Changes</HI> and <HI>Corruptions,</HI> which is contrary to all Accounts of those Times, and will appear highly improbable, if we reflect on the usual Tempers and Prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions of Mankind. But then it will be said, The Fathers testify to the <HI>Right,</HI> as well as Fact. I reply, This is as easily deny'd, as affirm'd; and we think, no sufficient Proof has yet appear'd. However, upon Supposition of Proof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l it remains a Doubt, whether mere human Testimony to the Divine Right of Episcopacy is sufficient to bind it on the Conscience, as a matter of Necessity to be believ'd &amp; practis'd. The <HI>Divine Right</HI> can be infer'd only from <HI>Scripture:</HI> if it be not <HI>evident</HI> from thence, it can never be made evident. And if the Divine Institution of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> must be fetcht from Scripture, then it will be necessary, in the <HI>first</HI> place, to prove the Apostolick Original of the <HI>Scriptures:</HI> without which it will be intirely out of our Power to prove the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of Episcopacy. But then, when we are satisfy'd of the Truth in this great Point, it follows in the Nature and Reason of Things, that we must now take the <HI>Divine Book</HI> for our <HI>only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of Faith. The universal uncontroul'd Tradition, in the Case of the sacred Canon, carries a rational Probability, that may justly beget in us an Esteem for the Bible, and put us upon examining its Contents: and when by viewing the inter∣nal Evidences of its Divine Original, we become so satisfy'd of that, as to take it for the Word of God; we are now of Consequence to judge and try all other <HI>Traditions,</HI> of a religi∣ous Reference, <HI>by this Rule,</HI> and not the Rule <HI>by them.</HI> And we must say, when we judge of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Tradition, by the Rule of <HI>Scripture,</HI> we can discern no evident <HI>Characters of Divinity</HI> upon it, to indicate an <HI>Apostolick Original;</HI> and there∣fore cannot but vote the Pretence of Divine Right, a mere Imposture.</P>
<P>In fine, allowing the Divine Right of Bishops to be held by some of the Fathers, yet (to return Mr <HI>Layman</HI> a Question or two of his own) "<HI>Do any of them assert this to be the</HI> UNIVERSAL <HI>Doctrine of the Church in those Days? Or do they plead for it as an</HI> ESSENTIAL <HI>Doctrine of Christianity?</HI> Perhaps I may safely answer (as he in another Case) NO, <HI>not a word of this.</HI> Whereas now, the Divine Right and the uninterrupted Succession of Episcopacy are <HI>fundamental</HI> Points with Men of Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Principles: who tell us, that such as are not in professed Unity and Communion with <HI>their Church,</HI> govern'd by
<PB N="88" REF="003651_0112_10023D169A24A468"/><HI>Bishops</HI> in a regular <HI>Succession,</HI> are out of Christ's <HI>Church</HI> and out of his <HI>Covenant,</HI> out of the <HI>Favour</HI> of God, and out of the Way to <HI>Salvation.</HI> Herein, I think, they tour very high above all the soaring Strains of the most hyperbolical Wri∣ter in Antiquity: or at least they can't produce the <HI>universal Suffrage</HI> of the primitive Fathers, to confirm these wild and rampant Imaginations. Sad wou'd it be for us, if the Truth of Christianity had no better Evidence, than the Truth of this strange Doctrine. Will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretend, that the vene∣rable ancient Doctors and Confessors, who seal'd with their Blood a Testimony to the Gospel of Christ, have left their Testimony to this <HI>high Rant</HI> in favour of Episcopacy! I dare say, tho' we despise this from our hearts, yet we don't herein reject the <HI>unanimous Suffrage</HI> of the primitive Church. Should it appear, that one or two Fathers have asserted the Divine Right of Episcopacy, as an Essential Doctrine of Christianity, let this be thrown into the List of "<HI>their</HI> NOSTRUMS, or <HI>private Opinions,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Layman (p.</HI> 83.) observes, <HI>They might have, as well as other Men:</HI>" and in which I hope, we may safely venture to differ from them. I trust, we are as <HI>strictly tenacious,</HI> as Mr. Layman, <HI>of all those great Truths, which all Christendom in those days agreed upon to be the Essentials of Religion:</HI> But then, when he ranks <HI>Episcopacy</HI> among these <HI>Essentials,</HI> we think he departs from the current Sense of Antiquity; and that this <HI>favorite Tenet</HI> of his is far from being one of those Points, which <HI>all Christendom</HI> in those days <HI>agreed</HI> upon. For ought I see then we may renounce Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s ESSENTIAL Doctrine; and yet retain a sufficient Respect for the primitive Church, and <HI>pay a</HI> just <HI>Deference to the universal Suffrage of those venerable Martyrs and Confessors, who are Witnesses to the Divine Original of the holy Oracles.</HI> It is therefore an intolerable Insult, and abusive Sophistry in this Gentleman, to represent us (first) as <HI>treating the primitive Fathers with Contempt,</HI> merely because we slight his pretend∣ed Testimonies from Antiquity in relation to Diocesan <HI>Episco∣pacy:</HI> and (then) as <HI>joyning with</HI> DEISTS and ATHEISTS, in undermining Christianity; because there is <HI>no external Evi∣dence of the Canon of the several Books of Scripture, that he knows of, besides the Testimony of those good Men, whom</HI> (as he will have it) <HI>we treat with so much Contempt.</HI> This is the mighty Argument, he urges in Support of his Charge: but there's as little Reason in his Plea, as of Charity in his Accusation. It seems to me, there's Abundance of Fallacy in this way of arguing.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="003651_0112_10023D169A24A468"/>
I would inquire of Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> Whether he will main∣tain, that God has hung the Salvation of Men's Souls upon this Nicety of knowing the <HI>exact Canonical</HI> Scripture receiv'd by the Fathers, or upon our having a <HI>complete Sett</HI> of the seve∣ral Books of Scripture? For if not, why does he make such a Stir with his <HI>external Evidence of the Canon of the several Books!</HI> Again, I have to inquire of him, how far he thinks the <HI>Testimony</HI> of the primitive Fathers may serve as an <HI>external Evidence</HI> to satisfy <HI>us,</HI> that we have pure and genuine Scrip∣tures, the true and intire Canon, without Mutilation, or Cor∣ruption? And how he'll make it appear, that their Testimony is the <HI>only</HI> external Evidence? Or if so, whether this external Evidence is <HI>absolutely necessary,</HI> that no other kind of Evidence will suffice without this? And whether he thinks, we can't have a rational <HI>Conviction</HI> of the <HI>Divine Authority</HI> of the Scrip∣tures, without any Regard to, or Knowledge of this Evidence from the Testimony of the Fathers?</P>
<P>I desire Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> to favour me with a just Reply to these Queries; the Resolution whereof seems to be of some Importance in the present Controversy. I am apt to think, it would help to <HI>ripen his Studies</HI> on these Points, if he would please to con∣sult the learned CHILLINGWORTH'S <HI>Protestant Religion.</HI>—In special I recommend to him these Parts of the Book, which I have had particularly in my Eye.

<P>And whereas Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> makes <HI>Episcopacy</HI> a parallel Case with that of Christ's <HI>Divinity</HI> (p. 90, 91.) insinuating, by his way of arguing, as if they were both <Q>DOUBT∣FUL <HI>Cases, in which we must come at the Sense of Scripture,</HI> by consulting <HI>the ancient Fathers,</HI> as <HI>faithful Witnesses to the Matters of Fact, whether the Church was govern'd by Bishops or not, and whether the eternal Divinity of the Son of God was taught or not;</HI></Q> I'm sure, this is to give a great Advantage to <HI>Arian</HI> Hereticks.

<P>Do's Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> think, the TRADITION of the Fathers may be safely depended on, as the <HI>Rule of Faith,</HI> or (in other Words) a just measure by which we may judge what we are assent to, as the Doctrine of Christ, and what not; when the <HI>Apostle</HI> in his old Age, after long Experience and Observation, finding how little the Understandings and Memories of Chris∣tians were to be trusted, and how Tradition was already <HI>cor∣rupted</HI> in so weighty a Point, as the Divinity of Christ, tho't i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary for him to <HI>write,</HI> on purpose <HI>that they might be∣lieve that Jesus is the Son of God.</HI> Joh. 20.31 —Will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretend, that the Doctrine of Christ's Divinity is con∣vey'd down to us by Traditionary Interpretations in the Books of the Fathers, more <HI>plainly</HI> and <HI>clearly,</HI> than it is in the A∣postolical Writings!

The word <HI>Servant,</HI> I suppose, retains its ancient <HI>honest</HI> meaning; but <HI>Knave</HI> is become a Term of <HI>Reproach,</HI> an ignominious Cha∣racter: Now I'm something at a Loss how to apply this part of the Parallel, whether to his <HI>Bishop</HI> or his <HI>Presbyter;</HI> being both degenerated from their original and innocent Mean∣ing: which makes me inclin'd to think his Instance <HI>not</HI> a fit <HI>Parallel.</HI> And I think so for another Reason; Because the words <HI>Knave</HI> and <HI>Servant</HI> were never, that I know of, pro∣miscuously as'd (as he pretends the words <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> are in Scripture) in an indifferent Application to two different Sorts of Persons at the same time.— I observe further, This his second Postularum is founded in an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> which do's not appear evidently true, That the Word <HI>Bishop</HI> chang'd its Sense in the <HI>Next Age.</HI> However I shall not stand at present on a <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chronism</HI> here; but will for Argument's sake suppose it a just state of Fact. Nevertheless, the Question rises, Whether the Fathers held their <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the <HI>new</HI> Sense of the Word, to be of <HI>Divine Right?</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> I doubt not, will be of Opinion, They did so. But then unhappily for him it falls out, since Words may <HI>vary</HI> their Sense in different Ages, we are consequently left at an <HI>Uncertainty</HI> what they meant by a <HI>Divine Right.</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> I suppose, will understand by it a Right of <HI>Duty</HI> or Obligation, by virtue of a positive <HI>Institu∣tion</HI> of Christ: But the <HI>Fathers</HI> might mean by it only a Right of lawful <HI>Liberty,</HI> by virtue of the Divine <HI>Permission</HI> (they apprehending no express Prohibition in the Case) and by virtue of the generall Rules of pursuing <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Unity,</HI> to which Ends they might think their invented <HI>Episcopacy</HI> a Means adapted: and it's well known, they were wont to stamp any thing with the Names of <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Apostolical,</HI> that they thought had a Tendency to those excellent Ends. So that these Phrases, <HI>Divine Right</HI> and <HI>Apostolical Tradition,</HI> as used by the Fathers, do manifestly carry as much <HI>Ambiguity</HI> with them, as the word <HI>Bishop</HI> in Scripture.</P>
<P>And then another Difficulty is▪ <HI>what</HI> was the <HI>new Sense,</HI> in which the Fathers apply'd the Word <HI>Bishop,</HI> after the appro∣priating of the Name to some special Persons in the Ministry; whether it denoted at first a different <HI>Order,</HI> or only a different <HI>Degree</HI> in the same Order; whether it denoted a <HI>Superiority of Power</HI> over the Presbyters, and an Exclusion of them from the Government of the Church, or only a mere <HI>Presidency,</HI> a
<PB N="97" REF="003651_0116_10023CF061AF94B8"/>Priority of one for Order's sake above the rest, still preserving an Equality of Power. I think the latter is more probably the true State of the Case. But Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> looking thro' the false Prospective of modern Usage, thinks the Name <HI>Bishop</HI> meant the same Thing in the primitive Church, as now in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Just as the <HI>Papists,</HI> whenever the Word <HI>Missa</HI> occurs in ancient Fathers, presently imagine it intends the same Thing, as it now thro' Custom signifies, since it has been ap∣propriated to that which they call the <HI>Sacrifice of the Altar.</HI> <Q>Whereas the Name at first (says Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> Irenic. <HI>p.</HI> 238) was taken only for the publick Service of the Church, so called from the Dismission of the People after it with an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, Missa est:</HI> but in process of Time the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> engross'd the Name <HI>Missa</HI> to its self; and when the Sacrifice of the Altar came up among the Papists, it was appropriated to that: For though they innovated <HI>Things</HI> never so much, yet it hath been alwaies the Policy of that Church not to innovate <HI>Names,</HI> that so the Incaute∣lous might be better deceived with a Pretence of <HI>Antiquity;</HI> and thus under the anciently simple name of <HI>Missa,</HI> lies at this day couched <HI>a Mass</HI> of Errours.</Q>—And I find Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> (p. 261.) making that Observation; <Q>They (i. e. among Protestants) that confess some of your (the <HI>Papal</HI>) Doctrins to have been the Doctrin of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> may be mistaken, being <HI>abused</HI> by many Words and Phras∣es of the Fathers, which may have the <HI>Roman</HI> Sound, when they are farr from the Sense. Some of them I am sure are so</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> —Of the same Stamp is the Argument for modern English Episcopacy, from the Use of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Bishop in Antiquity: for tho' the Name we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay allow to bear a somewhat <HI>different</HI> Sense in early <HI>Antiquity,</HI> from what it does in <HI>Scripture,</HI> yet its ancient Sense among the Fathers might differ still <HI>more</HI> from the modern Acceptation of it. Tho' the Name be retain'd, yet the Nature of the <HI>present</HI> Episcopacy may vastly differ from, if not be quite re∣pugnant to, the <HI>ancient</HI> Episcopacy.— I don't therefore at present see how my Cause will be hurt, tho' I shou'd grant Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> his two first <HI>Postulata.</HI></P>
<P>His THIRD and last <HI>Postulatum</HI> is, <Q><HI>That we can no more conclude, because the same Persons in Scripture, were called</HI> Bi∣shops <HI>and</HI> Presbyters, <HI>that there was no such Subordination of Officers, as we contend for; Than we can conclude, because the same Persons in Scripture were called</HI> Apostles, Presbyters, <HI>and</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="003651_0117_10023CEE401001A8"/>Deacons, <HI>(as certainly they were) that therefore there was no such Subordination of</HI> Deacons <HI>to</HI> Presbyters, <HI>and of</HI> Presbyters <HI>to</HI> Apostles, <HI>as you allow there was.</HI></Q> This Postulatum is founded on several <HI>Hypotheses,</HI> either of which will bear a Dis∣pute; and therefore must not pass for a self-evident Proposition.</P>
<P N="1">1. It supposes, That there was the <HI>same Subordination</HI> of <HI>Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>byters</HI> to <HI>Apostles,</HI> as of <HI>Deacons</HI> to <HI>Presbyters:</HI> Whereas in the latter Case there was manifestly a Difference of <HI>Order;</HI> but whether so in the former, is not clear, and out of question. The Apostolical Preeminence might result merely from their inspir'd Gifts and peculiar Circumstances; without a Superi∣ority of Order, and Commission-Powers essentially divers from those of Presbyters.</P>
<P N="2">2. It supposes, That there is in <HI>Scripture</HI> the <HI>same promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nous</HI> Use of the Words <HI>Apostles, Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> as of the Words <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters;</HI> which I see no Light at present to grant: For tho' we find the <HI>Apostles</HI> of Christ and the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Churches sometimes called <HI>Deacons</HI> (this Word in such Case being us'd in its general Signification, <HI>Ser∣vants</HI>) Yet where do we find any Persons, that were <HI>Deacons</HI> (in the restrained Sense of the Word, as meaning those special Officers so denominated; I say, where do we find <HI>Deacons</HI>) in Scripture called <HI>Apostles</HI> of Christ or <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Churches? Whereas in the Case of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> there was a mutual Interchange: the Application of the Names was <HI>reciprocal.</HI> This makes a vast Difference, and I think quite destroys Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Argument</P>
<P N="3">3. It is here supposed, That those whom after-times appro∣priated the Name <HI>Bishop</HI> to, were in fact and right <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as an Order distinct from those call'd <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> in Scripture, and having a Superiority of Power and Government over them. This Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> affirms: but I deny; and must wait for his Proofs.</P>
<P>I shall now beg Leave in my Turn to lay down a few <HI>Postu∣latums;</HI> which I desire Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> to grant me, or else give some Reason why they may not be admitted.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the <HI>same Name</HI> may happen to signify <HI>different Officers</HI> in several Ages As for Instance, the name <HI>Governour,</HI> in the former times of <HI>New England</HI> imported an Officer, acting as <HI>President</HI> or Moderator, with the power only of a CASTING <HI>Vote,</HI> in the General Court: Whereas, since the Change of the Constitution by a new Charter, the same Name <HI>Governour</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="003651_0117_10023CEE401001A8"/>denotes a Person representing the King's Majesty, and having a NEGATIVE Voice in all Acts of Assembly.</P>
<P N="2">II. That therefore the <HI>Contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce</HI> of the Application of a <HI>Name,</HI> does not hinder but that the Officer, to whom it is apply'd (tho' in appearance the <HI>same,</HI> having always been at the head of Affairs) may in Reality be <HI>very different</HI> (in regard of an Accumulation of new and essentially diverse Powers) from what the Officer, going under that Name, was in former Ages. So it may probably have been with the Name <HI>Bishop,</HI> in the Christian Church, which is chang'd from its ancient Significa∣tion, and carries with it a quite different Idea now, from what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had in early Antiquity: as much, it seems, as the word <HI>Missa, Priest,</HI> and other Names used by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffer in Sense now, from their original Meaning, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st introduc'd in the primitive Church. Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s that Observation (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 263.) <Q>It is a common Mistake to think that the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel succeed by way of Correspondence and Analogy to the <HI>Priests</HI> under the Law; which Mistake hath been the Foundation and O∣riginal of many Errors. For when in the primitive Church, the Name of <HI>Priests</HI> came to be attributed to Gospel Ministers from a fair Compliance (as was thought then) of the <HI>Christians</HI> only to the <HI>Name</HI> used both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> in process of time, Corruptions increasing in the Church, those <HI>Names</HI> that were used by the Christians by way of <HI>Analogy</HI> and Accomodation, brought in the <HI>Things</HI> themselves primarily intended by those Names: So by the metaphorical names of <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Alt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> at last came up the <HI>Sacrifice of the Mass;</HI> without which, they thought the names of <HI>Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> and <HI>Altar</HI> were insignificant. — It is easie to observe (says he, <HI>p</HI> 237.) that nothing hath been a more fruitful Mother of <HI>Mistakes</HI> and Errours, than the looking upon the Practice of the primitive Church through the Glass of <HI>our own</HI> Customs: Especially when under the <HI>same Name</HI> (as it is very often seen) something very <HI>different</HI> from what was primarily intended by the use of the Word, is set forth to us. It were no difficult Task to multiply Exam∣ples in this kind; wherein Men meeting with the <HI>same Names,</HI> do apprehend the <HI>same Things</HI> by them, which they <HI>now</HI> through Custom signifie, without taking notice of any <HI>Altera∣tion</HI> in the Things themselves signified by those Names.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. That we can no more conclude, because there was some Difference made between <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the primitive
<PB N="100" REF="003651_0118_10023CFD2D9DC7B8"/>Church, after the Apostles times, that there was <HI>such a Subor∣dination</HI> between them, as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> contends for; than we can conclude, because some Bishops in Antiquity were distin∣guish'd with an <HI>Archiepiscopal</HI> Dignity, that therefore there was and ought to be a <HI>Subordination</HI> of one Bishop to another; or because the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> was anciently vested with a <HI>Patri∣archal</HI> Primacy, that therefore there was and ought to be a <HI>Pope,</HI> as Christ's Vicar, sitting Monarch in the Church, Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> paramount to all other Bishops: which are Things, I suppose he will not allow.— It's a pertinent Remark of Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI>'s (Irenic. <HI>p.</HI> 252.) <Q>We read not of any Command, that in the <HI>San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edrin</HI> one should have some Peculiarity of <HI>Honour</HI> above the rest; this Men's natural Reason would prompt them to, by reason of a necessary Priority of <HI>Order</HI> in some above others: But yet all Order is not <HI>Power,</HI> nor all Power <HI>juridical,</HI> nor all juridical Power a <HI>sole</HI> Power: therefore it is a meer <HI>Pa∣ralogism</HI> in any, from <HI>Order</HI> to infer <HI>Power;</HI> or from a delega∣ted Power by <HI>Consent,</HI> to infer a juridical Power by <HI>Divine Right;</HI> or lastly, from a Power in <HI>common with</HI> others, to deduce a Power <HI>excluding</HI> others.</Q> — All which, I think, they are guilty of, who would establish <HI>modern Episcopacy</HI> by Inferences from the mere Name and Preeminence of <HI>Bishops</HI> in the primitive Church, or would defend the <HI>Papal Supremacy</HI> by Arguments from the ancient <HI>Primacy of Order</HI> and honourable <HI>Titles,</HI> by which the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> was distinguish'd among the Fathers. They stand on an equal Foot; therefore I joyn the two Cases</P>
<P><HI>My Design in these</HI> Postulates <HI>is to fix</HI> our Lay-writer, who seems very much <HI>of the Mind</HI> (notwithstanding his contrary Pretences) <HI>to play upon the Identity of Names and Ambiguity of Words.</HI> He tells us, that we <HI>may wrangle on upon Scripture with∣out End, if we set aside his</HI> Postulata: and yet in Defiance to his <HI>Postulata,</HI> he carries the <HI>impertinent Wrangle</HI> into the <HI>Tra∣ditionary</HI> Part of the Controversy; and has scarce <HI>any thing worth mentioning,</HI> to offer in his Cause, out of Antiquity, <HI>besides the Use of Names, and Words,</HI> and Phrases, that have the EPIS∣COPAL <HI>Sound,</HI> but as used by the Fathers are very distant from the <HI>modern Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</HI> I may justly return him some of his own Language, adapted to my purpose (<HI>p.</HI> 91, &amp;c.) <Q><HI>Here you did mighty well to pass by</HI> your own POSTULATA, <HI>because you knew well crouch where the Shoe pinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; and that the Life of the Controver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y as to</HI> Fathers <HI>depends on them: for set them aside, and you may</HI> WRANGLE <HI>on upon</HI> Fathers and Traditions
<PB N="101" REF="003651_0118_10023CFD2D9DC7B8"/><HI>without End; whch is what you seem to delight in,</HI> at least as much as we. <HI>If you had taken</HI> a just <HI>Notice of</HI> your own <HI>Postu∣lata, it would have spoiled,</HI> and perhaps prevented, most <HI>of your pretty Remarks</HI> upon Antiquity. <HI>Pray, Sir, let us act like Men, and not always be Children. We must wholly leave con∣tending about Terms.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It's worthy of Notice, what Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> says (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 239.) <Q><HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> then must be accurately <HI>distinguished,</HI> and the Sense of the Names must neither be fetched from the <HI>Custome</HI> now used, nor from the <HI>Etimologie</HI> of the Word, but from the undoubted Practice of <HI>Apostolical</HI> Times, if that can be made appear what it was.</Q> —And the <HI>Dr.</HI> observes (<HI>p.</HI> 321.) <Q>As to matters of <HI>Faith,</HI> we have <HI>Archimedes</HI> his <HI>Postulatum</HI> granted us for that, a Place to fix our faith on, though the World be moved out of its place, I mean the <HI>undoubted</HI> WORD <HI>of God:</HI> but as to matters of <HI>Fact</HI> not clear∣ly revealed in Scripture, <HI>no Certainty</HI> can be had of them, from the hovering Light of <HI>unconstant</HI> TRADITION,—in many things <HI>repugnant</HI> to its self.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VII. Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> having gone thro' his <HI>Postulata,</HI> upon the <HI>Design of fixing us, that we might come to a fair stating of the Case, and bring the Matter to a short Issue,</HI> proceeds to lay down this COROLLARY upon the whole (<HI>p.</HI> 60.) <Q><HI>From whence I gather</HI> (says he) <HI>That we must wholly leave contending about Terms, and that the</HI> QUESTION <HI>between us must be this, Whe∣ther the</HI> APOSTLES <HI>did not appoint in</HI> EACH CHURCH, <HI>a</HI> PRE∣SIDENT <HI>or</HI> GOVERNOR <HI>superior to, and with Jurisdiction over the</HI> PRESBYTERS <HI>or</HI> BISHOPS <HI>and</HI> DEACONS, <HI>who were Officers of</HI> THAT <HI>Church, as well as the</HI> PEOPLE <HI>under them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I must profess, the Gentleman took a wise Method, to guard himself, by prefacing his Question with a <HI>Caution</HI> against con∣tending about <HI>Terms;</HI> for he has, in this pretended <HI>fair</HI> State of the Case, made use of such <HI>ambiguous</HI> Terms and Phrases, as without a distinct Explication of them it's impossible to bring the Controversy to an Issue, but we must still be entangled with <HI>Logomachies.</HI> For my part I desire to understand, and to be understood: I hate, and I scorn a mere <HI>Strife of Words.</HI> And did I not think the <HI>Merits of the Cause</HI> were really affected by the <HI>Ambiguities,</HI> I find here, I should be far from picking a Quarrel with <HI>Terms:</HI> but I think, some he has used on this Occasion, are of too doubtful a Signification, to pass without a Definition. To avoid the Appearance of captious Wrangling. I'll but single out <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> Expressions.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="003651_0119_10023D199EC1C398"/>
Thus, when he speaks of the <HI>Apostles appointing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> CHURCH, it's a Question that enters into the Heart of the Controversy, <HI>What</HI> CHURCH <HI>is here to be understood?</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> knows, this Word has various Significations, and is of as uncertain a Sound, as the Word <HI>Bishop.</HI> I inquire then, what Notion he has of the primitive Churches, in each of which he says the Apostles ap∣pointed a President <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were they of the <HI>Diocesan,</HI> or the <HI>Pa∣rochial</HI> Form? By a PAROCHIAL Church, I suppose, is usu∣ally understood, A <HI>particular Society or fixed Congregation of neigh∣bour-Christians, combined for personal Communion, &amp; mutual Edification, in the Observance of Divine Ordinances, of publick Worship &amp; Discipline, administred by</HI> stated Presbyters or Bishops (one or more) <HI>resident among them.</HI> But by a DIOCESAN Church I suppose is usually understood, <HI>A Plurality of these Parochial Congregations, united under one General Officer, of the highest Order in the sacred Ministry, having the sole Power of Ordination, and Eccl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siastical Government within a certain District.</HI> If I mistake in my Definitions, I shall willingly submit to Correction. Now I desire the favour of Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> to say <HI>which</HI> of these different <HI>Species,</HI> he intended in the Question before us: or if neither, then to give a <HI>Third.</HI> If he speaks of the <HI>Parochial</HI> Church, we shall not be fond of contending with him; provided he do's not make it <HI>essential</HI> to a Church, to have subordinate Presbyters in it. But if he speaks of a <HI>Diocesan</HI> Church, I desire to be resolv'd in these Inquiries, Whether it was <HI>limited</HI> originally by the <HI>Apostles</HI> to a particu∣lar <HI>City;</HI> or took a wider Compass, and extended to a <HI>Multi∣tude</HI> of Cities and Towns, according to the Model of these Times? And whether he holds this <HI>Diocesan</HI> Church to be a Church of the <HI>lowest Order;</HI> so that Parochial Congregati∣ons are <HI>no Churches,</HI> but only <HI>Parts</HI> of the Church individuated by one <HI>Diocesan</HI> Pastor?</P>
<P>An other Expression I must remark upon, is that, wherein he <HI>characterizes</HI> the <HI>Officer,</HI> in Question: <Q><HI>Whether the Apostles did not appoint in each Church a</HI> PRESIDENT, <HI>or</HI> GOVERNOR <HI>superior to, and with</HI> JURISDICTION <HI>over the Presbyters</HI> &amp;c.</Q> The word <HI>President</HI> is equivocal, serving for very different Notions; and tho', for any thing in the Notation of the Word, it may have the same Idea with the Term <HI>Governor,</HI> yet in modern Use it signifies only a <HI>chief Manager</HI> or <HI>Director,</HI> as the <HI>President</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Council,</HI> whose Office is to propose Busi∣ness at the Council-Table, &amp; report — Now had Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> used but this single Term, I should have thought he meant nothing more than a <HI>Moderator</HI> in the Council of Presbyters:
<PB N="103" REF="003651_0119_10023D199EC1C398"/>And indeed he tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 101.) <Q><HI>That this is</HI> ALL <HI>he contends for,</HI> in behalf of Bishops, <HI>supposing them fixed in that Office, and no publick Acts of Government be done by the Presbytery without them at the head of Affairs.</HI></Q> But this seems to me, to appear all <HI>Jest,</HI> when I consider what follows in the Question, by way of Explanation; — "<HI>a President, or</HI> GOVERNOR (says he) <HI>superiour to, and having</HI> JURISDICTION, <HI>over the Presby∣ters</HI>" &amp;c. I must confess, this looks to me a very odd sort of <HI>Moderator!</HI> If his <HI>President</HI> must be such a <HI>Governor,</HI> he do's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> amuze us, when he says, a <HI>Moderator</HI> is all he contends for. The Gentleman appears plainly to contend for a <HI>Governor</HI> with <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over Presbyters. The word <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> sounds high; it may comprehend all Acts of Government, <HI>Legislative, Judicial,</HI> and <HI>Executive:</HI> I know not whether he meant all; or if not all, which did he mean? If he can soften down the Words <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> to a Sense consistent with the Idea of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> I shall be glad. 'Tis pity, he could to better define the Episcopacy he contends for. He leaves it at miserable Uncertainties.</P>
<P>In fine, I observe, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> in the Question having men¦tion'd the <HI>Presbyters or Bishops and Deacons,</HI> brings in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Phrase, "<HI>the People</HI> UNDER <HI>them.</HI>" Now I desire to know, in what Sense and how far he will allow the <HI>People</HI> to be UNDER the <HI>Presbyters or Bishops,</HI> by Apostolical Appoint∣ment. Have the <HI>Parish-Priests</HI> in the Church of <HI>England</HI> the Government of the People, the Power of the <HI>Church-Keys,</HI> in the full Degree, as the <HI>Apostles</HI> left it to the Presbyters of particular Churches? Did the Apostles leave the Presbyters <HI>Assistants</HI> in Discipline, and in possession of a proper Church-Government over the People as <HI>Assessors</HI> with the <HI>Prelates?</HI> And are the <HI>Parsons</HI> in the Church of England Governors in every Parish, under their respective Diocesans, as <HI>Presidents</HI> or <HI>Moderators?</HI> Or are the Diocesans <HI>sole</HI> Governors, exclusive of the Parish-Presbyters? By what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> says (p. 100.) <HI>The governing Powers and Power of Ordination</HI> are by Divine Ap∣pointment vested only in the <HI>Prelates,</HI> exclusive of all <HI>Part∣ners:</HI> <Q><HI>When</HI> Timothy <HI>and</HI> Titus <HI>are represented as being invest∣ed with them, and no mention is made of any that were</HI> PART∣NERS <HI>with them</HI> (says he) <HI>we can't justly presume, that any where in those Churches had those Powers.</HI></Q> And yet almost in the same breath (<HI>p.</HI> 101.) he says, <Q><HI>If you will allow them to have been</HI> MODERATORS <HI>of the Presbyteries, that is all we contend for</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Here seems to me to be a Contradiction
<PB N="104" REF="003651_0120_10023D1CA4566610"/>in Terms: I shall wish to see how the Gentleman will recon¦cile these two Passages, in appearance so inconsistent. Ti then we can't possibly understand what it is he contends for and his <HI>Question thus stated</HI> leaves us as much in the Dark as ever. I must beg him to define what the <HI>Power</HI> of his PRESBYTERS or <HI>Bishops</HI> is in their respective Churches, or how the People are <HI>under them:</HI> whether in any other Sense than as they are <HI>under the</HI> DEACONS. And I must intreat him more clearly to define the Power of his <HI>President</HI> or <HI>Gover∣nor,</HI> and tell us what is that <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over the Bishops and Deacons, which he attributes to the said Officer.</P>
<P>But after all this, perhaps we've been talking only of a mere <HI>Phantasm;</HI> a <HI>President</HI> that exists but in Imagination: for we must observe, in <HI>England</HI> it is not one <HI>Prelate,</HI> but one <HI>Lay-man,</HI> a <HI>Chancellor</HI> that is eminently this <HI>President,</HI> who has in his hand the Power of the Keys, and manages the Business of Court-trials; the <HI>Prelate</HI> seldom or not at all medling with it, and the <HI>Parochial</HI> Bishops intirely excluded from it, being but as <HI>Criers</HI> to publish the Sentences of the <HI>Lay-Chancellor.</HI></P>
<P>And truly I must observe, the Gentleman leaves us at a loss, whether by his <HI>President</HI> or Governor over the Presbyters, he does not actually mean this <HI>Lay-Chancellor:</HI> for in his Definiti∣on he omits telling us, whether the Officer appointed by the Apostles to exercise Jurisdiction over the Presbyters, was one so much as in <HI>sacred Orders.</HI> But if it seem too captions, to except at his Definition on this Account, and tho' we should suppose he meant such a President as is in Orders; yet there's another Exception, which I can't see how he will avoid the force of: and this is, That he has left us at Uncertainty whe∣ther his <HI>President</HI> must be of a superior <HI>Order</HI> to the Presby∣ters; and may not be an Officer in the Nature of an <HI>Arch∣bishop,</HI> of the same Order with the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops,</HI> tho' above them in <HI>Degree:</HI> for I hope the Gentleman will allow an <HI>Archbishop</HI> in the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be "<HI>a President or Governor superior to and with Jurisdiction</HI> (in some Sense) <HI>over the Presbyters or Bishops,</HI>" since he has so many transcendent <HI>Prerogatives,</HI> and the <HI>Prelates</HI> are oblig'd at their Consecration to take an <HI>Oath of due</HI> OBEDIENCE <HI>to him.</HI> Or perhaps Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s President may be the <HI>Archdeacon</HI> (an acknowledg'd mere Presbyter) or the <HI>Dean</HI> (still a Presbyter;) either of which (and the latter especially, in the <HI>Peculiars</HI>) is an Officer to whom his Description, said down in the Question, agrees ex∣actly;
<PB N="105" REF="003651_0120_10023D1CA4566610"/>—<HI>"a President or Governor superior to and with Juris∣diction over the Presbyters",</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus the Gentleman has put us to some Trouble, by his floating so in Ambiguities, to search out his Meaning. And now if I have been so happy as to hit upon his true Meaning, in either of the Instances above, I must desire to be inform'd how it appears, that <HI>the Apostles did appoint in each Church,</HI> such <HI>a Pre∣sident or Governor,</HI> whether Chancellor, Dean, Arch-deacon, or Arch-bishop. Was this the <HI>State of Things, while the Church was yet in her Embryo &amp; first Rudiments?</HI> Or did Things arrive to this Pass <HI>afterwards, when the State of the Church became more ripe and settled?</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretends (p. 61.) to <Q><HI>confine himself,</HI> in his Inquiries, <HI>to what Intimations we have of the Constitution of those Churches, which were grown into Form, and seem to have been settled in Scripture-times.</HI></Q> And a dear Friend of his, the <HI>Dialogist</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 23.) boasts of these his <HI>Letters,</HI> as ex∣hibiting <Q><HI>clear Proofs, that the</HI> SAME FORM <HI>of Government</HI> NOW <HI>in the Church of</HI> ENGLAND, <HI>has obtained from the</HI> APOSTLES <HI>Days.</HI></Q> Hence then we must conclude, if Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has prov'd any thing, he has prov'd the Divine Right of <HI>Archbishops, Arch-deacons, Deans,</HI> and <HI>Lay-Chancellors,</HI> as ap∣pointed by the Apostles, when the Churches were bro't into Form, <HI>Presidents or Governors over the Presbyters;</HI> for such they are according to the present Model of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and do as Governors enter as much into the Essence of the Constitution, for ought I see, as the <HI>Diocesan Prelates.</HI> For which Reason, if it should be reply'd by Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> that he pretends not to prove the Divine Institution of <HI>Chancellors, Deans,</HI> &amp;c. I can't help expressing my Astonishment at the strange Assurance of his Friend, who would bear us in hand, <HI>That in these</HI> Letters <HI>we shall find clear Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss, that the Original Government of the Church was Episcopal</HI> (i. e. after the manner of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so he must mean, for it follows) <HI>and that the</HI> SAME <HI>Form we</HI> NOW <HI>have in our Church, has ob∣tained in all Ages and Places, from the Apostles Days unto our own Times.</HI>" A Saying this, which it will be hard for the greatest Wit to invent a Parallel to, for the <HI>amazing Confidence</HI> it betrays; and <HI>could I hope by any means to escape the merciless L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh of this confident</HI> Dialogist (to borrow some pretty Phrases of his own, <HI>p.</HI> 3, 4.) I would a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> too, for the <HI>notorious Falshood; if a Man of such Fidelity as he can be guilty of such a Crime.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, notwithstanding the Uncertainty of Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI>'s Language in the Question, where by <HI>President or Gover∣nor</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="003651_0121_10023CECA90874A0"/>appointed by the Apostles in each Church, may be indiffe∣rently understood either of the <HI>soremention'd</HI> governing Offi∣cers in his Church; yet I am rather prone to conjecture, <HI>he</HI> intended the <HI>Diocesan Bishop</HI> or <HI>Prelate:</HI> and accordingly I shall <HI>de futuro</HI> so understand him.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VIII. Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> having <Q><HI>thus stated the Question, proceeds now to consider what Light the holy</HI> Scriptures, <HI>interpreted by the forementioned Rules, give us for the Resolution of it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here the Gentleman premises (<HI>p.</HI> 61.) That he <HI>shall wholly</HI> <Q><HI>wave the Consideration of the State of Things, while Christ was upon Earth, — and before the Churches were brought into Form, while they were intirely under the Guidance of Inspira∣tion.—And will confine himself to what Intimations we have of the Constitution of those Churches, which were grown into Form, and seem to have been settled in Scripture-times.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Well, and what is the <HI>Account</HI> he has gathered up of these Churches in their mature and settled State? Truly it appears to me but a jumbl'd Business. However, I will set his Report in as fair a Light, as I can: and make some Remarks, but as <HI>briefly</HI> as well as may be; for the Discussion of the Point, with relation to Scripture-Arguments, has been done so particular∣ly and fully by <HI>Elutherius</HI> in his <HI>Vindication,</HI> that I have but lit∣tle Room left me for any Reflections here. However, I will just offer a few Observations.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gentleman tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 62.) <Q><HI>As to</HI> PRESBYTERS, <HI>We find, that when the</HI> Apostles <HI>had converted any considerable Number in a City, they left 'em under the Guidance of Them;</HI> Ordaining ELDERS in every City (<HI>Church,</HI> it should be) <HI>Act</HI> 14.23.</Q>—What do's the Gentleman mean by <HI>Guidance?</HI> It should seem, he intends <HI>Pastoral Care.</HI> Hence he has that Phrase (<HI>p</HI> 63.) <HI>"They were at first taken</HI> CARE <HI>of by Presby∣ters:"</HI> and alledges in Proof <Q><HI>that Exhortation to the Elders of</HI> Ephesus, Act. 20.17. <HI>Take Heed to the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers, or Bishops.</HI></Q> Now, when the Churches had attain'd to this State of Things, methinks they were sufficiently <HI>ripen'd,</HI> and <HI>grown into Form;</HI> a Form very happy, and which the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> by long Experience find as effectual to the good and holy Ends of Church Societies, as the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Form ever was, in its most flourishing State.—And by the way, we have here a very notable <HI>Concession</HI> from our Lay-Adversary; That the <HI>A∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stles</HI> constituted <HI>Presbyters,</HI> with an Episcopal <HI>Care</HI> of the
<PB N="107" REF="003651_0121_10023CECA90874A0"/>Churches, <HI>before</HI> he pretends there were any fixed <HI>Prelates</HI> ap∣pointed by them. Here then we are agreed, That the Christian Churches were at <HI>first</HI> under the Guidance and Care of <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops, without</HI> a fixed <HI>President</HI> at their head: and now I might with good Advantage turn against him his own Argument from the <HI>safer Side</HI> (p. 114, 15) and in Imita∣tion of him say; He allows <HI>Presbyters</HI> to have been appoint∣ed by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and that the Churches were at first com∣mitted to their <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Guidance</HI> as the <HI>Bishops</HI> of them, with∣out any fixed <HI>President</HI> over them; This <HI>he</HI> allows: <HI>whereas</HI> we <HI>dispute</HI> the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Appointment of his <HI>fixed</HI> PRESIDENT, <HI>with Arguments, at least of very considerable Weight.</HI> From this <HI>we satisfy our selves, that</HI> our <HI>Side of the Question is the safer; and in such a Case</HI> (he tells us) <HI>the safest Side is to be chosen.</HI></P>
<P>But, to go on,</P>
<P N="2">2. I observe, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 63.) <Q><HI>It seems to be the Case every where, That the Christians of a</HI> CITY <HI>were called a</HI> CHURCH, <HI>how many Congregations soever they made</HI>:</Q> and of this he appears to be grown to an Assurance, by that time he had got to <HI>pag.</HI> 94.—Thus, it seems, we have an Answer already to one of the Questions, I just now put to him. But the other Question waits to be resolv'd: and agreable to it, I will here indulge my inquisitive Humour so far as to ask Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> Whether when the Christians of a <HI>City</HI> were multiply'd so as to make several Assemblies under the Care of stated <HI>Rectors,</HI> we are now to look on the Church as <HI>ripen'd</HI> and <HI>grown into Form?</HI> Cou'd it be a <HI>proper Church,</HI> while un∣der the Guidance of the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops,</HI> without a <HI>fixed President</HI> at the head of Affairs? <HI>If so,</HI> I think the <HI>Presbyte∣rian</HI> Cause (as might easily be shewn) will receive no small Advantage from this Concession. But <HI>if not,</HI> then I pray what must be the State of the <HI>Liturgick</HI> Congregations in <HI>New-England?</HI> At this Rate I see not how it can be allow'd, there is so much as one <HI>true Church,</HI> among all those of the <HI>Prela∣tical</HI> Persuasion here. Well may they (as they affect to do) call themselves <HI>the Church of</HI> ENGLAND: for <HI>that</HI> they are, if a <HI>Church</HI> in any Sense. THERE resides their <HI>fixed President;</HI> if they have any at all in a special Relation to <HI>them:</HI> and <HI>there</HI> only, if any where, have these new-fangl'd Separatists their <HI>Church-Existence.</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Principle, for ought I see, destroys the Being of <HI>Parish-Churches:</HI> for, be there ever so many <HI>Parishes</HI> in a <HI>Diocese,</HI> or <HI>Bishoprick,</HI> they all make but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one Church.</HI> 'Tis then but by a hard <HI>Cata<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hresis,</HI> that he can call his Congre∣gation
<PB N="108" REF="003651_0122_10020255A03AFA00"/>a <HI>Parish-Church;</HI> it being at best but a <HI>part</HI> of a Church, and having its essential constitutive <HI>Head</HI> a thousand Leagues off. Sad! if the "<HI>Head must answer for the Faults of the Body.</HI> p. 66.</P>
<P>And, by the way, if <HI>the word</HI> Church <HI>in Scripture was gene∣rally used to signify the Christians of a</HI> CITY; <HI>if it was in Scripture-times the Case every where</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> says) <HI>That the Christians of a</HI> CITY <HI>were called a</HI> CHURCH; Then, I must beseech him to let me know, how he can reconcile the Form and Practice of <HI>his own</HI> Church to this Principle. It seems an unconscionable Stretch of the Line, beyond all Scripture-Bounds, to draw it round a <HI>Multitude</HI> of Cities and Towns, as in <HI>England;</HI> and much more to extend it from thence to the very <HI>Ends</HI> of the Earth. In this Respect <HI>London,</HI> I think, may almost vie with <HI>Rome:</HI> and truly it seems to me as consistent with Scripture-Institution, to unite the universal Church under one Oecumenical Patriarch as to attempt the Coalition of innume∣rable Christians in widely distant Countries under one Prelate or Primate. What Distinction is there, to make this lawful and the other not? — But I pray, <HI>when, how,</HI> and by what <HI>Rule</HI> or <HI>Reason</HI> was the ALTERATION from the approv'd Custom in Scripture-Times bro't about? This mighty Change, from the Church and Bishop of a <HI>City,</HI> to the Church and Bishop of a <HI>Province,</HI> a <HI>County,</HI> or large Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of Ground, contain∣ing <HI>many</HI> Cities and Towns, and Hundreds of Congregations, must needs (I conclude) pass with Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> if he abide by his avow'd Principles, for an <HI>Anti-Scriptural,</HI> and therefore an <HI>Anti-Christian</HI> Innovation: And surely he must be able from History to give us some Account of its Rise and Progress: for, can it be imagin'd, there shou'd be no visible Traces left of this Innovation? Could it possibly be introduced (according to the Episcopal way of reasoning) <HI>without much Opposition,</HI> and <HI>Complaint,</HI> especially from the <HI>degraded</HI> City-Bishops? Can this be thought, when Government is so nice and tender a Point with Men? And What! did <HI>no Tongue or Pen rise up in Defence</HI> of the City-Churches? Is it to be dream'd, that this Encroach∣ment upon their fundamental Rights, this Invasion of their undoubted Privileges, shou'd be tamely submitted to, without any Noise or Contradiction? And however it came on, it shou'd seem, it must be a comparatively <HI>modern</HI> Innovation. For do you judge, it cou'd possibly come up in the Days of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> or <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> or even <HI>Cyprian;</HI> who must needs have had a clear Knowledge of the original Constitution of the Christian Churches, and cou'd not be mistaken about it, since
<PB N="109" REF="003651_0122_10020255A03AFA00"/>they liv'd so nigh to <HI>Scripture-Times!</HI> Surely those good Men, those holy Martyrs, cou'd never be consenting to so manifest a <HI>Deviation</HI> from the sacred Apostolick Model of Church Go∣vernment. They cou'd never have a Hand in pulling down the <HI>City-Presidents,</HI> set up by the Apostles for Conservators of Peace, Unity, and Order in the City-Churches; when the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and Congregations under them must certainly be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to fall a Sacrifice to Strife, Debate, and Disorder, without the Presence of their respective <HI>Governor:</HI> at the head of Affairs among them; and when indeed these <HI>Presidents</HI> themselves, having once got the humour of Usurpation, wou'd under Colour of prudential Reasons for enlarging their Bishop∣rick, be apt to indulge the Lust of Dominion, and Monopoly, which is ever insatiable and knows no Bounds: And by this unhappy Means the Christian World wou'd be fill'd with con∣tinual Animosities and Emulations, the fruit which is Confu∣sion, most opposite to the grand professed End of Prelacy. Upon such Considerations as these, I must needs be of Opinion, That none of the good old Fathers joyn'd in this Conspiracy, to dissolve the <HI>City-Church-State,</HI> and abolish that <HI>City-Episcopacy,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> says was settled <HI>every where</HI> in Scripture-times, and which I suppose it is he speaks of (<HI>p.</HI> 112.) where he celebrates <Q><HI>Episcopacy</HI> as <HI>a wise Appointment of the Apostles under the Guidance of the Holy Ghost, being in the nature of the Thing</HI> (says he) <HI>the most likely Form of Government, to prevent Divisions and Disorders:</HI></Q> and adds, <Q><HI>It is apparent from the whole face of Ecclesiastical History, that not Episcopacy</HI></Q> [no besure, not this CITY-Episcopacy, much less PARISH-Epis∣copacy] <Q><HI>but Opposition to it, and</HI> USURPATION OVER <HI>it, have been the Cause of those horrid Convulsions,</HI></Q> which the Christian World has often groaned under. Happy were it for Christendom, if all Papal Tyrants and Protestant Usurpers in the Churches every where had their extended Territories crumbled into just Divisions, and Episcopacy were reduc'd within the ancient modest Bounds of a <HI>Town</HI> or City at most. Will not Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> joyn in the Wish for a Return of <HI>Scripture-Times,</HI> when there were <HI>City-Churches</HI> and <HI>City-Bishops</HI> every where, and when therefore a Prelate of <HI>modern Figure</HI> wou'd have appear'd a prodigious Sight! — But I must go on to observe,</P>
<P N="3">3. Our Author (<HI>p</HI> 63.) says, <Q><HI>The Churches were at first taken Care of by Presbyters, still under the Government of the Apostles, as appears from the Epistles to the</HI> Corinthians</Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="003651_0123_10023D051D727F78"/>
Since he has mentioned the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> it leads me to make one Observation, which may perhaps be of some Direction to us in forming a Judgment, as to the Truth of Mr. <HI>Layman's</HI> Maxim, That in Scripture-times a Church consisted of <HI>all</HI> the Christians of a <HI>City,</HI> how many Congregations soever they made. Now, if it be supposed, that there was a Plurality of Christian Congregations in the City of <HI>Corinth,</HI> then we may naturally be led to apply to them that Passage in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.34. where the Apostle prohibits <HI>their Women's speaking in the</HI> CHURCHES. It seems to intimate a <HI>Number</HI> of Churches in that City, if there be any Weight in that Observation, <Q>That it is not to be thought, he would <HI>particularly</HI> have mention∣ed <HI>their</HI> Women, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, if he had not meant the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Corinth,</HI> where they were likest to usurp that Authority.</Q> It has been often asserted by our Adversaries with Confidence, that it doth not once fail, That where Churches are mention'd in the <HI>Plural,</HI> they are the Churches of a <HI>Province;</HI> not of a <HI>City:</HI> But it seems, here it fails for once.</P>
<P>I will suppose then, that there were <HI>Parish-Churches</HI> in the City of <HI>Corinth:</HI> and I have Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Authority for it, That when the Epistles to them were written, they were under <HI>the Care of Presbyters,</HI> without a fixed President. But, says he, "<HI>still under the Government of the</HI> APOSTLES" 'Tis granted, the Apostles might superintend the Churches every where. The Direction and Influence of inspired Apostles seem'd very needful in the Infant-State of the Church; and they continu∣ally travel'd about, doing Good, confirming the Souls of the Disciples, planting and establishing of Churches. But yet, were the Churches, that had only <HI>Presbyters</HI> or Bishops, without a fix'd Governor, any MORE <HI>under the Government of the Apostles,</HI> than other Churches, where these fix'd Governors are pre∣tended to be in place? Were not these fix'd <HI>Presidents</HI> as much under their superintendency, as the Presbyters? Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> says (<HI>p.</HI> 65.) <Q><HI>I am sure no Bishop in</HI> England <HI>pre∣tends to more Authority over the Clergy and People of his Diocess, than the Epistles of St.</HI> Paul <HI>give to</HI> Timothy <HI>&amp;</HI> Titus:</Q> what Truth there may be in this, I will not stay to examine; tho' I believe, the Gentleman would be hard put to it to make it out: However, I must return him this Observation. That I am sure many a <HI>Presbyter</HI> in <HI>England</HI> has no greater Marks upon him of Subjection to his Bishop, than do appear on <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> to the Apostle <HI>Paul:</HI> at least these Prelates appear in as
<PB N="111" REF="003651_0123_10023D051D727F78"/>much Subordination to and Dependency upon this Apostle, as the Presbyters of <HI>Corinth;</HI> which may easily be made evident, by comparing the several Epistles to them respectively. But whether they were <HI>equally</HI> so, or not; yet if <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> notwithstanding their prelatical Character, were at all <HI>"still under the Government of the Apostles,"</HI> it suffices to my Purpose, and proves the Vanity of this Objection in the Case of the <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I observe, Mr. Layman adds a Limitation, <Q><HI>They were at first taken Care of by Presbyters,</HI> TILL <HI>such Time as they</HI> (i. e. the Apostles) <HI>finding their Work too great, and their Charges too extensive for themselves, appointed fixed Governors, or Presidents over both Clergy and People of each City, as St.</HI> Jerom <HI>says, to prevent Schisms,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Here the Gentleman seems to intimate, that the Apostles kept the Government of the Churches in their own hands, and manag'd it themselves, as long as they cou'd; but at last thro' the Exigence of the Case, and as a Remedy to Schisms, not so well prevented by <HI>their own</HI> Government, they at length threw it up, and out of Necessity appointed <HI>fixed Governors</HI> over the Clergy &amp; People in <HI>their own Room.</HI> I wish he wou'd give as the Scripture-Account of this Fact; for I can't let it pass for <HI>a notorious, universal, glaring matter of Fact.</HI> Nor can I let <HI>Jerom</HI> stand for a Witness to it; methinks he liv'd too <HI>late</HI> to be an Evidence in the Case: neither indeed do I know, that he has pretended to be one. The Passage out of this Father, alledg'd by our Author, I'm of Opinion (notwithstanding what he has offer'd, <HI>p.</HI> 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 7.) had no Reference to the <HI>Apostles</HI> Times: and I think I have very good Reason on my side, when I consider Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s Arguments on this head (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 279, 80.) to which I refer Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> for a Solution of the main Difficul∣ty he has started.</P>
<P>And as to the Notion of the Apostles appointing <HI>fixed Pre∣sidents</HI> over the Clergy, in their <HI>own Time,</HI> will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> please to accept Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s Judgment in the Case, after he had <HI>ripen'd his Studies</HI> in Antiquity (<HI>Unreas. of Sep.</HI> p. 269.) where he observes; <Q>In the <HI>Preface</HI> before <HI>the Book</HI> of <HI>Ordination,</HI> it is said, That <HI>it is evident— that from the A∣postles Time there have been these Orders</HI> &amp;c. What is the Reason that they express it thus, FROM <HI>the Apostles Time,</HI> rather than IN <HI>the Apostles Time,</HI> but that they believed, while the <HI>Apostles</HI> LIVED, <HI>They</HI> managed the Affairs of Go∣vernment <HI>themselves:</HI> — While the <HI>Apostles</HI> lived, it is
<PB N="112" REF="003651_0124_10023D2966988228"/>probable there were no <HI>fixed Bishops,</HI> or but few: But as they went off, so they came to be setled in the several Churches.</Q>—The Dr. indeed appears for <HI>unsetl'd</HI> Governors besides the Apostles in their Life-time; such as <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus:</HI> But thinks there were no <HI>fixed</HI> Bishops, or but few. So then, it seems, 'tis doubtful whether during the Apostolic Age the Churches had any such fixed Governors at all; but continu'd all that while under the <HI>Guidance</HI> of the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Parish-Bishops;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s fixed <HI>Presidents</HI> came in <HI>after</HI> the Apostles time. The Presidency then in Scripture-times, for ought I can learn, was an <HI>unfixed Itinerant</HI> Thing; this is the best, that Scripture-Example can be pleaded for: and over this, it shou'd seem, there was the Presidency of the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves. Surely, whether it was a fixed or unfixed Presi∣dency, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will allow, that the Apostles reserv'd to themselves the same Power of Superintendency they had, while the Churches were under the <HI>Presbyters</HI> only. I ask this Gentleman to tell me plainly, whether his suppos'd <HI>fixed Go∣vernors</HI> were the Apostles <HI>Successors, in codem Gradu,</HI> upon an exact <HI>Par</HI> with them: or were they their <HI>Substitutes,</HI> Delegates, and Representatives? In short, were they <HI>supreme</HI> Governors, or only <HI>Sub</HI>-Governors? A direct Answer to this plain short Question will perhaps go a great way towards deciding the pre∣sent Controversy. If he says, they were the <HI>former,</HI> I think it will be inconsistent with all the Accounts of Fact we have in Scripture: and if he says, they were the <HI>latter,</HI> then I doubt no Argument can be drawn to his Purpose; for the <HI>Deputies,</HI> we may rationally think▪ ceased with their <HI>Principals,</HI> and cou'd have no <HI>Successors.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, shou'd we allow there were actually <HI>fixed</HI> Presi∣dents in the Apostles times, yet it must be remembred, They were but <HI>City</HI>-Presidents, and <HI>fixed</HI> within those narrow Bounds; and where it happen'd there was but one Congregation in a City, there cou'd be but a <HI>Parish</HI> President. And I can't de∣vise at present, how any Argument can be drawn from either of these Presidents, in favour of modern Episcopacy; which, whether it be consider'd as <HI>National, Provincial,</HI> or only <HI>Diocesan,</HI> is a vast Remove from the <HI>ancient</HI> Episcopacy. If we shou'd own Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Presidents, as appointed by the Apostles; yet a <HI>Diocesan</HI> over <HI>many</HI> Cities, an <HI>Archbishop</HI> over a whole <HI>Province,</HI> and a <HI>Primate</HI> over all <HI>England,</HI> must be ac∣knowledg'd to be beside Scripture-Institution &amp; Example; un∣less <HI>Peter's</HI> Supremacy among the Apostles be pleaded. Here
<PB N="113" REF="003651_0124_10023D2966988228"/>is one Usurpation upon the back of another; the <HI>Diocesans</HI> usurp the Rights of the <HI>City</HI>-Bishops; and the <HI>Archbishops</HI> usurp again from them; and for ought I know, the first <HI>Pri∣mate</HI> usurps upon the other; and in many Episcopal Countries the <HI>Pope</HI> usurps from <HI>Metropolitans</HI> and <HI>Patriarchs:</HI> and for ought appears, the <HI>Pope</HI> may watch over his extensive Charge, as easily as an english Primate or Prelate over his. For, as one observes, "As the <HI>Bishop</HI> can do all by the <HI>Parochial</HI> Clergy, for Word and Sacraments, and by <HI>Chancellors, Archdeacons</HI> &amp;c. for his Discipline, such as it is; and as the <HI>Primate</HI> can rule a <HI>na∣tional Church</HI> by his and the Bishops <HI>Courts:</HI> So can the <HI>Pope</HI> rule the Church Catholick (whithersoever scattered over the whole Earth) by <HI>Cardinals, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Bishops,</HI> by his <HI>Legate,</HI> and other Officers of his Appointment". And I challenge Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> to shew any essential Difference in these two Cases.</P>
<P N="5">5. I observe, our Author attempts to illustrate and confirm his preceeding Remarks, by a Variety of <HI>Examples,</HI> or Instan∣ces of particular Churches so form'd and settled, as he had represented the Case, in Scripture-times.</P>
<P>And here (<HI>p.</HI> 64) he begins with JERUSALEM, the Mother-Church, of which he will have St. <HI>James</HI> to be the first Bishop. But it seems to me, to lie as an insuperable Prejudice against this Opinion, That the <HI>Apostles</HI> did for a great number of Years (if Antiquity gives us a true Report) make <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the place of their usual <HI>Residence,</HI> after their Travels resorting thither as their head-quarters; one or other of them gene∣rally being on the Spot: So that the Apostles having that Church almost continually under their own Eye, it superseded all Occasion for a fixed President, and defeats all Pretences therefore of <HI>James</HI>'s being the first Bishop there. However, I will consider what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has to say upon the head.</P>
<P>I observe, to put a Colour on this Notion, he quotes several Scriptures, <HI>Act.</HI> 15.19. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 21.18. Yet he <Q><HI>pretends not an undoubted Conclusion from Scripture for it</HI> (as he ob∣serves to us, <HI>p.</HI> 98.) <HI>but only this, That seeing the most ancient Writers from the beginning have constantly asserted him to be the first Bishop of</HI> Jerusalem, —<HI>those Texts should be under∣stood in that Sense.</HI></Q> And the Gentleman appears very angry at <HI>Elutherius</HI> for calling this a <HI>Whimsical Plea,</HI> as hereby re∣flecting upon "<HI>all Antiquity,</HI> which <HI>with one Voice says, that St.</HI> James <HI>was the first Bishop of</HI> Jerusalem". But I take leave on this Occasion to remind Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> of his own <HI>Postulate:</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="003651_0125_10023CD5A8D5FEA8"/>for if the <HI>same Word may be us'd in different Senses, in different Ages,</HI> he should first have shewn us, that the Word <HI>Bishop</HI> was used in the <HI>same</HI> Sense by the <HI>Fathers</HI> from the Begin∣ning, as it bears in the <HI>present</HI> Age: But the Gentleman has with his own kind hand confounded any Pretence of this nature. For he himself has told us (<HI>p.</HI> 68.) That <Q><HI>the Word</HI> Bishop <HI>was</HI> but <HI>by</HI> DEGREES <HI>appropriated to the first Order</HI>:</Q> and he has fix'd the Date of this Fact after the Time of the first Writer among the Christian Fathers, if I understand him right; for having quoted <HI>Clemens,</HI> he says (<HI>p.</HI> 106.) <Q><HI>The Words,</HI> Bishop <HI>and</HI> Presbyter, <HI>were</HI> NOT YET <HI>fixed to signifie the different Orders.</HI></Q> I'm aware indeed, the Gen∣tleman may reply, That this refers only to the Time of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ment</HI>'s writing his Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians;</HI> which he has, per∣haps with some artful Design, placed <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 67. But I am of Opinion, it may as well be apply'd to the Period of his Life; and that for this Reason, because if the best Accounts may be credited, that <HI>Father</HI> died within about seven, eight, or nine years after his writing this Epistle: For <HI>Chronolo∣gists,</HI> I suppose generally, place his <HI>Death</HI> about the begin∣ning of the <HI>second</HI> Century; some in the <HI>second</HI> Year thereof; tho' others place it in the last Year of the <HI>first</HI> Century: And some of the best Chronological Authors date his <HI>Epistle</HI> Anno 93, which was but <HI>two</HI> years after his being chosen Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI> (Compare <HI>Calvisius</HI> and <HI>Isaacson.</HI>) We may then very rationally conclude, that the <HI>Synonimous Use of the Words</HI> Bishop <HI>and</HI> Presbyter continu'd at least to the End of the first Age.</P>
<P>And from hence I draw this Inference, in Contradiction to Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> That if <HI>James</HI> was <HI>from the Beginning</HI> call'd Bi∣shop of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> yet here's a Course of fifty years (the fa∣mous Council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in which he is represented by our Author <HI>acting as a Governor or Superintendent,</HI> being <HI>A. D.</HI> 52▪) in all which Time <HI>James</HI> certainly was not called <HI>Bishop</HI> in the <HI>modern</HI> Sense of the Word (which Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> must intend, when he says, St. <HI>James</HI> was call'd Bishop of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> or else he's guilty of the grossest Fallacy) and therefore it is an abusive Imposition (since the <HI>Usus loquendi</HI> is of such material Consideration, in the Construction of <HI>Words,</HI> which by Tract of Time often lose their original Sense, that an Argument can't safely be built merely upon a perpetual Harmony of Lan∣guage) I say, it's therefore an Imposition on the Reader, to tell him, <Q><HI>That the most ancient Writers from the</HI> BEGINNING <HI>have</HI> CONSTANTLY <HI>asserted St.</HI> James <HI>to be the first Bishop of</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="003651_0125_10023CD5A8D5FEA8"/>Jerusalem.</Q> So that, for ought I see, if <HI>Elutherius</HI> call'd this a <HI>chimerical Notion,</HI> he did not <HI>miscall</HI> it; and if he <HI>made himself merry with it,</HI> it was far from being (as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> wou'd have it) <HI>with every little Reason.</HI> I would ask the Gen∣tleman, whether this St. <HI>James</HI> was an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or not? If he <HI>affirms;</HI> I must needs be of the Opinion, that, an Apostle a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed City Bishop,</HI> is truly a very ridiculous <HI>Chimera,</HI> a perfect Castle in the Air. And if he <HI>denies;</HI> then it will follow, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who was <HI>not</HI> an <HI>Apostle,</HI> presided in the grand Council at <HI>Jerusalem, "giving Sentence</HI> (according to Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> p. 64.) <HI>and therein acting as a Governor or Superintendent,</HI>" over an As∣sembly of <HI>Apostles:</HI> and if this be not a <HI>Chimerical Notion,</HI> I must confess my self a Stranger to common Sense, and to the meaning of common Language. — Further, I observe, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> makes St. <HI>James</HI> a <HI>Bishop</HI> with a <HI>Presbytery</HI> about him. <Q><HI>The Apostle</HI> Paul (says he, <HI>ibid.</HI>) <HI>returning to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.18. <HI>is said,</HI> to go in unto <HI>James</HI> and the Elders, i. e. <HI>his Presbytery being present.</HI></Q> It seems then, even after the Church there was <HI>grown into Form,</HI> the <HI>Presbyters</HI> were not ex∣cluded from all Interest in consiliary and judicial Proceedings, but were at least what <HI>Ignatius</HI> (Ep. ad <HI>Trall.</HI>) calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <HI>Jerom</HI> calls <HI>Senatus Ecclesiae,</HI> a Bench of Assistants, and in a Sort Assessors with the Bishop, assumed <HI>in partem So∣licitudinis &amp; Regiminis.</HI> It appears too, the Bishop's Diocess was not so big, but that ALL <HI>the Elders,</HI> or stated Presbyters (tho' there were even several Congregations) might conveni∣ently meet in a Body, for Consultation, and Management of Affairs of common Concernment, together with their President. Surely one might be tempted by this Reflection to think, St. <HI>James</HI> was not really (however nominally) a Bishop in the <HI>hierarchick</HI>-Sense, but rather a <HI>Congregational</HI> Bishop; or at most but a President of the <HI>Classical</HI> Stamp, the <HI>Moderator</HI> of an Assembly of Elders: The Presbyterians will consent with one Voice, I doubt not, to an Episcopacy of this kind. But so much for the first Instance of Episcopal Government. Only I will just observe, it will be worth while for Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> to inquire how these <HI>Presbyteries</HI> (which, I know, even some <HI>Epis∣copalians</HI> say, continu'd in the Church for above three Centuries) came to be <HI>abolish'd.</HI></P>
<P>The next Instance is CRETE. <Q><HI>The Epistle of St.</HI> Paul <HI>to</HI> Titus (says Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> p. 64.) <HI>seems</HI> plainly <HI>to fix him there with governing Powers,</HI></Q>—over <HI>the People of that Church.</HI> So again, p. 99. <Q><HI>There are very plain Intimations in the Epistle to</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="003651_0126_1002025E440B00F0"/>Titus, <HI>of</HI> his <HI>being fixed Governor of the Church of</HI> Creet: — <HI>a Matter of Fact seconded with the universal Suffrage of Antiquity.</HI></Q> I think rather, by the <HI>Scripture</HI>-Account of <HI>Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> which challenges the first Consideration with us, there's more to be said for his being Bishop of <HI>Corinth,</HI> than of <HI>Crete.</HI> However, to pass that, methinks his being <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Crete</HI> must not pass for a <HI>glaring</HI> Fact, if we only consider an Observation Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> himself has made, which seems to spoil all the Evi∣dence in this <HI>second</HI> Instance: for he remarks (<HI>p.</HI> 64.) <Q><HI>One special part of</HI> Titus<HI>'s Business was to</HI> ordain Elders in EVERY CITY, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5.</Q> I perceive then there were more Cities than one in <HI>Crete:</HI> 'tis indeed the largest and most celebrated Island on the Coast or <HI>Greece,</HI> and was in times past a conside∣rable Kingdom; now known by the name of <HI>Candia,</HI> but sometimes call'd <HI>Hecato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>polis,</HI> from its containing an <HI>hundred Cities.</HI> Therefore if (according to what we heard just now from Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>) the Christians of a <HI>City</HI> made a <HI>Church,</HI> and fixed Presidents or Governors were appointed over the People of <HI>each City;</HI> Then it's a rational and necessary Consequence, that <HI>Titus</HI> was not one of the fixed Governors, this Gentleman is contending for, i. e. a <HI>City-Bishop:</HI> but if Governor at all in <HI>Crete,</HI> must be a <HI>Provincial</HI> Governor, a supreme President over the Bishops of many Cities (for <HI>Titus</HI> was to ordain Pres∣byters or Bishops in <HI>every City</HI>) which makes him at least an <HI>Archbishop,</HI> or <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mate.</HI> This certainly must needs be his Rela∣tion to <HI>Crete;</HI> if he was in any Sense a fixed Governor there: he could have no fixed Relation to that Island upon Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI>'s Plan of <HI>City</HI>-Episcopacy. I desire the Gentleman to solve this Difficulty, in his next. Were the Bishops in every City subordinate to <HI>Titus,</HI> as a common Governor over all? Or was he limited to one City? Or how was it? If he was <HI>limited,</HI> with what Propriety could he be call'd Bishop of <HI>Crete?</HI> unless there was but <HI>one Church</HI> in the whole Island; which indeed is what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> supposes, when he uses the Phrase <HI>"That Church",</HI> and again "<HI>the Church of</HI> Creet:" but this is Language, I believe, he won't find in all Antiquity. <HI>Doro∣theus</HI> calls him only <HI>Bishop</HI> IN <HI>Crete:</HI> but <HI>Eusebius</HI> speaks of him as "<HI>Over the</HI> CHURCHES <HI>of</HI> Crete", <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And if he was <HI>not</HI> limited, but had an extensive and equal Power over all the Cities, and their Bishops, neither could he in that Case be properly call'd <HI>Bishop</HI> of Crete; for his extensive Power speaks him rather a <HI>Metropolitan</HI> or <HI>Primate.</HI> And truly I believe, there may a much better Shew of Argument be ad∣vanced,
<PB N="117" REF="003651_0126_1002025E440B00F0"/>both out of Scripture &amp; Antiquity, for his being a Provin∣cial <HI>Primate,</HI> than a <HI>City-Prelate.</HI> Hear what the learned <HI>Nicolson</HI> says to this purpose (<HI>Apology</HI> for Church of <HI>Engl.</HI> p. 62, 3.) <Q>What more decent among Church-governours, than that some be Superiours, some Subordinate? — Even among the Twelve were there not <HI>Chief</HI> Apostles?—For <HI>Peter, James,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> are called <HI>Pillars.</HI>— Thus it is with their Successors the <HI>Bishops:</HI> they are all <HI>pares Potestate;</HI> in the Power, he that is at <HI>Eugubium,</HI> is as great as he at <HI>Rome</HI> &amp;c. But yet for all this, one Bishop may be set in a <HI>higher Degree</HI> than another, and one set <HI>over</HI> another.— What was <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Timothy?</HI> were they not more than ordinary Bishops? <HI>Titus</HI> had the Charge over the whole Isle of <HI>Crete,</HI> in which there were <HI>seven</HI> Bishops besides. (<HI>Miraeus</HI> lib. 4 de Notitia <HI>Episc.</HI> pag. 181.) This was <HI>Paul</HI>'s Companion, saith <HI>Chrysos∣tome</HI> (Hom. 1. <HI>in Titum</HI>) that was <HI>approved;</HI> otherwise <HI>Paul</HI> would not have committed unto him an <HI>whole Island,</HI> and the Trial and Judgment of <HI>so many Bishops.</HI> To <HI>Timothy,</HI> if we believe <HI>Theodoret</HI> and other Ancients, was committed all <HI>Asia</HI> the lesse; in which were questionless instituted by the Apostles <HI>many Bishops.</HI> Of the last Example there may be some Scruple; of the first there can be <HI>no Doubt</HI> to any one that lists not to be <HI>contentious.</HI></Q> Thus he. — So then Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> and his Brother <HI>Dialogist</HI> (if I may safely bor∣row some <HI>Words</HI> from their Preface or Introduction, p. 3.) <HI>have fair Warning given</HI> them, <HI>what they must pass for</HI> in the Opinion of one of their own <HI>Club,</HI> viz CONTENTIOUS <HI>Dunces</HI> and <HI>Bigots, if they presume irreverently to differ from</HI> the learned <HI>Nicol∣son</HI>'s Judgment. If therefore I might be thought worthy to be of Council to them, I would humbly advise, That they talk no more of <HI>Titus</HI> as a <HI>mere</HI> Bishop, but as a <HI>more than ordinary</HI> Bishop, i. e. in Ecclesiastical Style, an <HI>Arch-bishop</HI> or <HI>Primate.</HI> I doubt not, the Gentlemen will presently be <HI>"aware of my Trap":</HI> and I believe, I have 'em pretty fast, let <HI>Titus</HI>'s Cha∣racter and Title be "AS <HI>what it will.</HI>"</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Layman's</HI> next Instance is EPHESUS; of which <HI>Church</HI> he pretends <HI>Timothy was the fixed Governor.</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 65.) You see, still the Gentleman carries on his <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> that <HI>the Christians of a</HI> CITY <HI>made a</HI> CHURCH: Well then, let the Christians at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> how many Congregations soever they compos'd, pass for <HI>a Church.</HI> But will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> say, <HI>Timothy</HI> was only Bishop of a <HI>City-Church?</HI> You've heard what the aforesaid Episcopal <HI>Apologist</HI> says, "To <HI>Timothy if we believe</HI> Theodoret
<PB N="118" REF="003651_0127_100202A6D1C92960"/><HI>and other Ancients,</HI> was <HI>committed all</HI> Asia <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sse; in which were many Bishops.</HI> I then return Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> his own words (<HI>p.</HI> 68.) <Q><HI>That it was Fact, we have the Witness of</HI> Theodoret, <HI>an</HI> APPROVED <HI>ancient Writer.</HI></Q> Will he now accept the Testimony of that <HI>approv'd Writer</HI> to this matter of Fact! If he refuses, with what face can he expect, others shou'd pay any Deference to that Father's Authority? But if he com∣plies, I doubt it will turn out badly for his Cause, which I am apt to think must sink and fatally miscarry, if TIMOTHY'S spe∣cial Relation to EPHESUS, as <HI>fixed President</HI> or Bishop there∣of, be given up, which is the grand Plea made use of in De∣fence of Prelacy. I argue upon it, Either <HI>Timothy</HI> was the fixed Governor of the <HI>Ephesian</HI> City-Church, or he was not: which will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> now upon second Tho'ts chuse to do; deny, or affirm? If the Gentleman, convinc'd by <HI>Theodoret</HI>'s Tes∣timony, sees fit to retract his former Opinion, and now denies <HI>Timothy</HI>'s fixed Relation to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> as Bishop of that City, he will then spoil the fairest Flourishes in his Letters, on the Scripture-Argument, and I doubt must never afterwards bring the Epistles to <HI>Timothy</HI> into this Controversy, which have hitherto been the main Supports of his Cause. But if he chu∣ses to adhere to his own Opinion, and insists upon <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Relation to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> as Bishop of that <HI>City</HI> only, then I say, still his Cause seems in equal Danger; for if he presumes to deny a matter of Fact, witness'd by THEODORET, celebrated by himself as an <HI>approv'd ancient Writer,</HI> he at once confounds the whole Authority of <HI>Tradition,</HI> and must never more open his Lips in vain Boasts of <HI>glaring Fact,</HI> the <HI>Sense of the primitive Church,</HI> and <HI>Suffrage of the good old Fathers.</HI> — I think, here is <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ylla</HI> and <HI>Chary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dis:</HI> and I can't but pity the Gentleman in his critical Situation, while Danger looks him in the face, which way soever he turns. Let him take Care, that to avoid the <HI>Gulf,</HI> he don't run himself on the <HI>Rock,</HI> and split.</P>
<P>But further, I have a different kind of Argument to offer. Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has made a Concession (<HI>p.</HI> 63.) <Q><HI>That in the Church at</HI> Ephesus <HI>there were many Elders or Bishops; and that at first it was taken Care of by</HI> Presbyters (as the Case seems to be every where else) <HI>still under the Government of the</HI> A∣postles, <HI>till such Time as they</HI> saw fit to <HI>appoint fixed Governors</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Now, by all that I can find in Scripture, the <HI>Ephe∣sian</HI> Church was never taken out of that first State; but re∣main'd thro' Scripture-times taken Care of by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> still under the Inspection of the Apostle <HI>John</HI> in particular. There's
<PB N="119" REF="003651_0127_100202A6D1C92960"/>a general Consent of History, that this Apostle had his proper Home at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> &amp; that there he died just before the Close of the first, or upon the Commencement of the second Century, when he was about 90 years old; tho' some say, he liv'd to 120, which must bring him nigh 30 years into the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> Century. Now if that Apostle usually resided at <HI>Ephesus</HI> all his days, it super∣seded the Necessity of a fixed Governor there; whatever there was elsewhere. Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 63.) gives this as the <HI>Reason</HI> of the Apostles appointing fixed Governors in any place, <Q><HI>They finding their Work too great, and their Charger too extensive for themselves.</HI></Q> But this is a Reason, that cou'd very little af∣fect the Case of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> which the Apostle <HI>John</HI> cou'd easily superintend, it being his Home. I find an Episcopal Author observing; <Q>When the APOSTLES <HI>departed</HI> from any Church, which they had planted, in that <HI>then</HI> they appointed a <HI>Bi∣shop.</HI> For while <HI>They</HI> remain'd <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI> the Place, there was no such <HI>Need;</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> supplying the Wants of those Churches with their Presence, Letters and Messengers. But when they were <HI>finally</HI> to forgo <HI>those Parts,</HI> then they <HI>began</HI> to provide for the Necessity and Security of that Church by settling <HI>Episcopal</HI> Power.</Q> (<HI>Nicols.</HI> Apol. <HI>p.</HI> 57, 8.) Indeed the <HI>Apologist</HI> makes this Remark in relation to the Case of <HI>Timothy;</HI> who, he thinks it probable, was made Bishop, when <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Miletum.</HI> Therefore it follows; <Q>St. <HI>Paul</HI> at this time was to take his Leave of the Churches at <HI>Asia;</HI> he saith it plainly (<HI>Acts</HI> 20.25.) That <HI>they shou'd see his face no more:</HI> most probable then it is, that at this time he left <HI>Timothy</HI> to supply his place a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ephesus.</HI></Q> Nay, but verily it seems much more probable, in my humble Opinion, that he did <HI>not</HI> leave <HI>Timothy</HI> to supply his place; there being manifestly <HI>no Occasion</HI> for it, in as much as they had the Apostle <HI>John</HI> so much among them, and <HI>saw his Face</HI> very frequently, who was certainly sufficient to supply the place of the Apostle <HI>Paul.</HI> If it be Fact, that St. <HI>John</HI> had his Residence chiefly at <HI>Ephe∣sus,</HI> then I presume to turn that Remark of the <HI>Bishop</HI> (for so I take him to have been) I say, to turn the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s own Ob∣servation against himself; <HI>For</HI> (says he) <HI>while they</HI> (i. e. any of the Apostles) <HI>remain'd in or near any place, where a Church was planted, there was no such Need for appointing a Bishop; the Apostles supplying the Wants of those Churches with their Presence</HI> &amp;c. Now according to this, how improbable is it, that <HI>Timo∣thy</HI> shou'd be made <HI>stated Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> when there was <HI>no such Need</HI> for one there, and such abundant Occasion for
<PB N="120" REF="003651_0128_10023CDF0E2F6C88"/>him at the same time in other places, in or nigh which there was no <HI>Apostle</HI> remaining! And if the Apostle <HI>John</HI>'s residing there be a Consideration that argues the Improbability of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being fixed Bishop there, during <HI>his</HI> Life; then it necessarily infers, that probably he <HI>never</HI> was so at all, if it be true, what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 103.) insinuates, That St <HI>John</HI> outlived <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
<P>I will now briefly compare some of the <HI>Probabilities,</HI> on either Side of the present Question. As to <HI>Timothy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI> observes (p. 65.) <Q><HI>The Apostle's writing to him once and again, as concerned chiefly at</HI> Ephesus, <HI>plainly intimates, that there was a fixed Relation between him and that Church.</HI></Q> This is the best he has to say, for <HI>Timothy.</HI> But there's much more of Probability in the Apostle <HI>John</HI>'s Case. Chronologists tell us, St. <HI>John</HI> wrote and publish'd his Gospel at <HI>Ephesus;</HI> some dat∣ing it <HI>A. D.</HI> 69. tho' others much later.

<P>I'm aware, it will be objected, that St. <HI>John</HI> inscrib'd his Letter for the <HI>Ephesine</HI> Church, <HI>Unto the</HI> ANGEL <HI>of the Church of Ephesus.</HI> But surely this cou'd not intend <HI>Timothy;</HI> if Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Observation be just (<HI>p.</HI> 103.) <Q><HI>That</HI> Timothy <HI>shou'd be living, when the Epistles of St.</HI> John <HI>were written seems to be a groundless Guess.</HI></Q> Nor need this <HI>Angel</HI> intend any one of Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s fixed Presidents; as it were easy to make appear, were it worth while to enter into the Argument.—I think, the Gentleman has set himself in a very odd Light, by first intro∣ducing his Plea, from these <HI>Angels</HI> of the Churches, with that Remark (<HI>p.</HI> 66.) <Q><HI>Who in the</HI> Revelations <HI>are called</HI> Angels, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccording to the</HI> PROPHETICAL <HI>Style of that</HI> MYSTERIOUS <HI>Book;</HI></Q> and then after a warm Debate upon the Subject, closing up his Reasonings with that sanguine Reflection <HI>(p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.)</HI> <Q><HI>It seems to me, I must confess, unaccountable, that any shou'd go about to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lude so</HI> PLAIN <HI>a Case,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

<PB N="121" REF="003651_0128_10023CDF0E2F6C88"/>Church, and tell us who succeeded <HI>Timothy</HI> in his Bishoprick; that we may know the <HI>Name</HI> of this <HI>Angel,</HI> that <HI>John</HI> wrote to: it may have a happy Tendency to settle the Dispute. Let us therefore have this <HI>plain Case</HI> well attested by the <HI>unani∣mous Suffrage</HI> of primitive Writers: for we are as little dispos'd, as himself, to be put off with <HI>groundless Guesses,</HI> or the single Opinions of <HI>private Doctors.</HI> Indeed (as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> ob∣serves, <HI>Irenic</HI> p. 321.) <Q>The main Difficulty lies in the im∣mediate <HI>Succession</HI> to the Apostles: — the main Seat of the Controversy lies there, whether the <HI>Apostles</HI> upon their <HI>withdrawing</HI> from the Government of Churches, did substi∣tute <HI>single</HI> Persons to succeed them or no; So that unless <HI>that</HI> be cleared, the very <HI>Deed</HI> of <HI>Gift</HI> is questioned.</Q> And what the <HI>Dr.</HI> says concerning ROME, that famous City, where one wou'd think the Succession shou'd be clear, if any where, may, I fear, with equal Reason be apply'd to EPHESUS; "<HI>Here the Succession is as</HI> MUDDY <HI>as the</HI> Tiber <HI>it self.</HI>" Let Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> purge and clarify the foul Stream of Succession; or we shall make bold to slight his <HI>Quotations</HI> from <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> (p. 101.) as foreign to the purpose. But thus much for the first Objection.</P>
<P>I'm aware of another Objection against what I have advanc∣ed, relating to the <HI>Ephesian</HI> Church's remaining thro' Scrip∣ture-times in the Care of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> under the Inspection of the Apostle <HI>John;</HI> It may be said, that St. <HI>John</HI> as an <HI>Apostle,</HI> being oblig'd to be much in <HI>travelling,</HI> for the Propagation of the Gospel, must necessarily be often <HI>absent;</HI> which made a <HI>fixed Governor</HI> at <HI>Ephesus</HI> absolutely requisite. But to this I an∣swer, (1.) It is to be observ'd, that not the <HI>occasional</HI> Absence, but the <HI>final</HI> Withdraw of an <HI>Apostle</HI> from any Place, is pretend∣ed to be the Reason or Occasion of a Prelate or <HI>fixed President</HI>'s being appointed. And then (2.) I answer, This Objection car∣ries as much Force in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Case, as <HI>John</HI>'s: for it is appa∣rent, that <HI>Timothy</HI> was an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> acknow∣ledges (<HI>p.</HI> 65.) That "<HI>Evangelists were indeed</HI> ITINERANT <HI>Officers.</HI>" Now, if <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being an <HI>itinerant</HI> Officer is thought not inconsistent with his being a particular <HI>fixed Go∣vernor</HI> of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> much less can it be imagin'd, that <HI>John</HI>'s being an <HI>itinerant</HI> Officer shou'd be inconsistent with his retain∣ing a general <HI>Apostolical</HI> Superintendency over the Church there, in common with the other <HI>Asiatick</HI> Churches; which, if we believe what Antiquity reports, the Apostle <HI>John</HI> govern'd to his dying Day.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="003651_0129_10023CCD804A7680"/>
Indeed it's a common, and I think, a material Objection, brought against <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being Bishop of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> That he was an EVANGELIST: But Mr. Layman <HI>(ubi supra)</HI> answers, <HI><Q>To say this, is to say nothing to the Purpose, because that Office might be exercised by any Order of Officers,</Q></HI> even Deacons: "<HI>One of the 7 Deacons</HI> (says he) <HI>being an Evangelist.</HI>" But to say <HI>this,</HI> I'm sure, is to say nothing to the Purpose: he him∣self has given us a <HI>Key</HI> to that Case, and has taught us by a following Passage (compar'd with what he has said, <HI>p.</HI> 62.) to argue upon it; <HI>What if</HI> PHILIP were a <HI>Deacon</HI> (fixed in that Relation to a particular Church) this do's <HI>not at all hinder but that, having stood some time a Candidate for further Preferment in the Church, and by behaving well in inferior Affairs purchased to himself a good Degree, he might</HI> AT LENGTH <HI>be ordered by the Apostles, to do the Work of an</HI> EVANGELIST, and become an <HI>iti∣nerant Officer.</HI></P>
<P>But were <HI>Evangelists</HI> (as this Gentleman affirms) <HI>indeed itine∣rant Officers?</HI> How then cou'd <HI>Timothy</HI> be the <HI>fixed Governor</HI> of a City-Church? An <HI>itinerant</HI> Officer, in a fixed Relation to a <HI>particular</HI> Church, seems to me a palpable Inconsistency: Here's <HI>"a Combination of Ideas"</HI> indeed, which I want Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Skill to reconcile to the Notions of common Sense. Yet if that must not pass for an Inconsistency, I'm sure: must, An <HI>itinerant Preacher</HI> a <HI>fixed Pastor</HI> at the same time: But Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> is confident, <Q><HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> might <HI>take up a fixed Residence</HI> in their respective Churches, <HI>and yet withal do the Work of an Evangelist among the unchristianized People there and in the Places adjacent.</HI></Q> — I'm as confident then, the <HI>Prelates</HI> of those Times must have fewer Incumbran∣ces, notwithstanding their <HI>"great Metropolitical Churches,"</HI> and it shou'd seem, must have more Zeal, than our <HI>modern</HI> Prelates: who appear readier to go upon some Civil Embassy to foreign Courts, than upon the Gospel-Message to <HI>unchristianized People;</HI> so far from this (if we are rightly inform'd) that they can hardly find the Heart, or seldom get Leasure, to preach the Gospel even <HI>at home,</HI> to their own People. Further I observe, the Gentleman says, They were ORDERED &amp;c. Now it's uncer∣tain whether he do's not use this Word in the same Sense, as <HI>his Church</HI> do's in the Book of <HI>Ordination,</HI> where the Ordaining of Ministers is call'd the ORDERING of them. If so, then I perceive, the <HI>Work of an</HI> EVANGELIST is by <HI>Apostolical</HI> Ap∣pointment a Work that <HI>Prelates</HI> are ordered or ordained to. I wish truly I cou'd see our <HI>English Bishops</HI> engaging Heart and
<PB N="123" REF="003651_0129_10023CCD804A7680"/>Hand in this part of their Work. So I shou'd hope, they wou'd do their glorious Master much greater and better Ser∣vice, than by attending <HI>Parliaments</HI> and <HI>Court-Affairs.</HI> At least If they shou'd send out their <HI>Delegates,</HI> to gospelize the <HI>Pagan</HI> Parts of his Majesty's Dominions, I'm sure, it wou'd be a noble Attempt, and they might hereby do more Service to the Kingdom of Christ, than by sending their <HI>Missionantes</HI> into foreign Parts <HI>already</HI> gospelized, where they can find in many places only small Parcels of <HI>factious</HI> Persons to preach to, and must spend their Zeal in setting up <HI>Liturgical</HI> Assemblies on the Foundations of <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Division.</HI></P>
<P>However, as to the Point, <Q><HI>that the Office of</HI> EVANGELISTS <HI>might be exercised by</HI> any Order <HI>of Officers,</HI> even DEACONS,</Q> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> happens herein to differ from his judicious HOOK∣ER, who tells us (<HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l. Pol.</HI> p. 421.) That <Q><HI>Evangelists</HI> were <HI>Presbyters;</HI></Q> and therefore their Office was incompatible to <HI>Deacons,</HI> who are another and lower Order. Yet were they such Presbyters, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou'd not be <HI>Pastors</HI> at the same time; which (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he) <Q>were Presbyters also, howbeit <HI>setled in some certain</HI> Charge, and thereby <HI>differing</HI> from <HI>Evangelists;</HI> whom the Apostles sent <HI>abroad,</HI> and used as <HI>Agents</HI> in Ecclesiastical Affairs, wheresoever they saw Need:</Q> And it's remarkable, he names <HI>Timothy</HI> among them who "<HI>were</HI> THUS <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yed.</HI>"</P>
<P>I know not whether Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> may not be of Opinion, that the Prelates of his Church are properly <HI>Evangelists,</HI> as much as <HI>Timothy;</HI> and will interpret that Text to the Purpose, <HI>He</HI> GAVE <HI>some Apostles and some Prophets, and some Evangelists,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for the Work of the Ministry,</HI> TILL <HI>we all come in the Unity of the Faith.</HI> — If this be his Opinion, I will repeat to him that apposite Passage of his beloved CHILLING WORTH'S (<HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lig.

<PB N="124" REF="003651_0130_10023CCFAC236870"/>the Work of Evangelists</HI> was an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Thing in their Case. Well, if so I desire then to be inform'd upon what <HI>Reasons</HI> he suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that their Office, as <HI>Evangelists,</HI> was <HI>extra∣ordinary,</HI> any more than their Office as <HI>Presidents.</HI> For ought I know, he may by such a Concession in the former Case, take an effectual Method to break the Neck of <HI>Episcopa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y;</HI> at least, of the <HI>Arguments</HI> for it, from the Instances of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, I don't remember, that Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> all this while has told us, whether <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> when be∣come <HI>fixed▪ Presidents,</HI> were advanc'd to an ORDER <HI>distinct</HI> from and <HI>superior</HI> to the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops.</HI> So that, for ought I can discern, his <HI>Presidents</HI> may be ranked with <HI>Metropolitans, Primates, Patriarchs;</HI> who are acknowledg'd to be only <HI>Gra∣dus in Episcopatu:</HI> and I'm persuaded <HI>no Bishop</HI> or <HI>fixed President in Scripture-times pretended to more Authority over the Clergy of his Diocess, than</HI> Custom <HI>gives to</HI> Metropolitans and Patriarchs, over the <HI>Prelates</HI> in their respective Provinces or Districts; not∣withstanding their <HI>Primacy</HI> or <HI>Patriarchate</HI> is founded purely upon View of <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Order.</HI> Do's Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretend his <HI>fixed Presidents</HI> in Scripture-times were <HI>superior</HI> to, and had <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over the Presbyters? I find Episcopal Writers not scrupling, in the Case of <HI>Archbishops,</HI> to ascribe to them. <Q><HI>a Me∣tropolitical</HI> JURISDICTION;</Q> and I find the learned Apologist (<HI>Nicol.</HI> p. 100.) saying <Q>It was established from the beginning, that in all Provinces there shou'd be <HI>one</HI> CHIEF <HI>Bishop,</HI> which from the Mother-City was called a <HI>Metropolitan;</HI> to <HI>whom</HI> all the other <HI>Bishops</HI> shou'd be SUBJECT, and <HI>to</HI> HIM <HI>ac∣comptable.</HI> — For Discipline can never be well administred among them that have an <HI>equal</HI> Power. (It follows, <HI>p.</HI> 101.) <HI>His Office</HI> was to call the rest of the Bishops of the Province to the <HI>Synods;</HI> — in which <HI>he</HI> sat as <HI>President,</HI> and the rest might not proceed to do any thing <HI>without Consulting him:</HI> When they assembled but once a Year, <HI>many Causes</HI> that did abide no Delay, were committed by them to the <HI>Metro∣politan</HI> hearing the Judgment. To him then lay <HI>App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ales.</HI></Q> The same Author (<HI>p.</HI> 64.) to justify the Right and Prehemi∣nence of <HI>Metropolitans,</HI> afterwards call'd <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> alleges the <HI>35th</HI> of the <HI>Apostolical Canons:</HI> which says <Q>The Bishops of every Nation must know <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Chiefest, the First, the <HI>Primate;</HI> and willeth him to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as HEAD among the <HI>Bishops</HI> of that Province: who in the <HI>Afri∣can</HI> Council is call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q> And he informs us (<HI>p.</HI> 67.) That those <HI>Primates,</HI> as they <Q>could call <HI>Synods</HI> through their
<PB N="125" REF="003651_0130_10023CCFAC236870"/>whole Province, so cou'd PUNISH any <HI>Bishop</HI> or Church-man or other under them.</Q> I find Bishop JEWEL (<HI>Reply,</HI> p. 111.) observing; <Q><HI>Gregory</HI> found this fault in the Bishop of <HI>Salonae,</HI> that being within the <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> of his Province, he was <HI>consecrate</HI> without <HI>his Knowledge;</HI> and he writes of the Bishops within his Charge, in those terms, <HI>Episcopi</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I, <HI>Episcopi m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i</HI> COMMISSI: <HI>My</HI> Bishops; Bishops within my <HI>Cure.</HI></Q> Thus it seems, the Power of <HI>Primates,</HI> above the rest of their Order, ran pretty high; and may I not safely say, there is <HI>no Bishop in</HI> England, <HI>pretends to more Authority over the Clergy of his Diocess?</HI> Or do <HI>the Epistles of St.</HI> Paul <HI>give more Au∣thority to</HI> Timothy <HI>and</HI> Titus? What tho' the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church at <HI>Ephesus</HI> "is <HI>represented exercising Jurisdiction there</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> insinuates, <HI>p.</HI> 67.) <HI>in examining into the Preten∣sions of those,</HI> Who say they are Apostles, and are not! <HI>What</HI> if <HI>all this can amount to no less, than that he was ecclesiastical Governor there!</HI> Do's it necessarily infer, that Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s fixed Presidents are of a superior <HI>Order</HI> to <HI>Presbyters?</HI> Verily there's no such Consequence: for we see, in the Case of <HI>Primates,</HI> a <HI>gradual</HI> Difference between Officers of the <HI>same Rank:</HI> and that a <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over <HI>Prelates,</HI> equal perhaps to what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> claims for his <HI>fixed Presidents,</HI> in point of Government, has ex∣isted, without the <HI>Primates</HI> being of a <HI>distinct</HI> and <HI>higher</HI> Order. Now, why may not the Difference, that Antiquity seems to make between <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Prelates,</HI> be accounted for in the like manner? Why mayn't <HI>Prelacy,</HI> as well as <HI>Primacy,</HI> be tho't an Advancement, not in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> but only in <HI>Degree?</HI> To this perhaps Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will answer, That the <HI>Scriptures</HI> make the Difference between fixed <HI>Presidents</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> not merely gradual, but plainly ESSENTIAL; inasmuch as they tell us, that at <HI>Ephesus</HI> and <HI>Crete</HI> the <HI>governing</HI> Powers and Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> were <HI>appropriated</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus:</HI> for he argues (<HI>p.</HI> 100.) <Q><HI>When</HI> THEY <HI>are mention'd as being invest∣ed with them, and</HI> NO MENTION <HI>is made of any that were</HI> PARTNERS <HI>with them; we can't justly presume, that any others in those Churches had those Powers.</HI></Q> But to this Objec∣tion I reply; It's easy to solve and dissipate the seeming Dif∣ficulty here, by an impartial View of a <HI>parallel</HI> Case, we have in Scripture: I mean that of our Saviour's delivering the KEYS <HI>to</HI> Peter. <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.18, 19. <HI>I say unto</HI> THEE, <HI>That thou art</HI> PETER, <HI>and upon this</HI> ROCK <HI>will I build my Church: — and I will give unto</HI> THEE <HI>the Keys</HI> of the Kingdom of Heaven; and <HI>whatsoever</HI> THOU <HI>shalt bind</HI> &amp;c. Pray let Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="003651_0131_10023CE220D136F0"/>consider now: Do not the <HI>Keys</HI> here imply the <HI>governing Power; and the Power of Ordination?</HI> Is not PETER <HI>represented as invested with them? And no Mention made here of any that were Partners with him?</HI> But will he argue in this Case, <HI>We there∣fore can't justly presume, that any others in the Church had those Pow∣ers,</HI> or whatever is meant by the <HI>Keys?</HI> Surely no rational <HI>Protestant</HI> cou'd refrain crying FY upon his Argument, apply'd to this parallel Case! However, Protestants are not backward to allow <HI>Peter</HI> a Primacy of Order (as 'tis call'd) or rather a Priority for Order's sake. Agreably Bishop JEWEL (<HI>ubi supra,</HI> p. 226.) observes, <Q>St. <HI>Peter</HI> in the old Fathers is diversly called, the <HI>First,</HI> the <HI>Chiefe,</HI> the <HI>Top,</HI> the <HI>high Honour</HI> of the Apostles; and in <HI>Eusebius</HI> and St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and PRINCEPS <HI>Apostolorum:</HI> the word <HI>Princeps</HI> (says the Bishop) is not alwaies taken for <HI>Prince,</HI> or Governor endued with <HI>Power,</HI> but often times for the <HI>first</HI> Man, or <HI>best</HI> of the Company. In this Sense <HI>Cicero</HI> saith, <HI>Philosophorum princeps Aristippus.</HI> So is St. <HI>Peter</HI> called <HI>Princeps Apostolorum.</HI></Q> Yet, I can't but think, if <HI>Timothy or Titus</HI> had been call'd in Scrip∣ture <HI>Princeps Episcoporum,</HI> our Lay-Adversary wou'd have pro∣duced this, as an indisputable Evidence of his being a <HI>fixed Pre∣sident</HI> and having <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI>— Nay, had it been said, that to <HI>Timothy</HI> was committed the Care of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and to <HI>Titus</HI> the Care of <HI>Crete,</HI> he wou'd probably have built a triumphant Argument upon it, for their being <HI>sole Governors</HI> of those Places. But I will produce a <HI>parallel</HI> Case, in which there may be as much Colour for the like Argument; and yet when examin'd, it will be found far from carrying uncontroulable Evidence with it. <HI>Paul</HI> says <HI>(Gal. 2.7, 8.) The Gospel of the Uncircumcision was committed unto</HI> ME, <HI>as the Gos∣pel of the Circumcision was unto</HI> PETER: <HI>For he that wrought ef∣fectually in</HI> Peter <HI>to the Apostleship of the Circumcision, the same was mighty in</HI> Me <HI>towards the Gentiles.</HI> Shall we now think (however the <HI>Text</HI> may seem to favour such an Opinion) that <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> divided the whole World between them? One being the Apostle of the <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and the other of the <HI>Un∣circumcision.</HI> Shall we understand it <HI>Exclusively</HI> of others? What! were there no Apostles but <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul?</HI> Were the rest all <HI>dead?</HI> Or were they all <HI>degraded</HI> from their Office, that none of 'em shou'd be admitted <HI>Partners</HI> with <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul?</HI> Or had they all done like <HI>Demas,</HI> who <HI>having loved this present World, forsook</HI> Paul, and retir'd from publick Service?

Finally, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> brings in the Case of the seven Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 66.) and prosecutes his Argument upon it, <HI>p.</HI> 100. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have touch'd on this before: and shall now only observe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or two Things further. The Gentleman founds his Argu∣ment chiefly on a METAPHOR ("<HI>the metaphorical Title of</HI> An∣gel," <HI>p.</HI> 103.) which he wou'd laugh at in any body else; and which is the more wonderful in him, because he has tol'd us (<HI>p.</HI> 84.) <HI>"That every</HI> ALLEGORICAL <HI>Gloss of a Father is not to (be taken for an Interpretation."</HI> Why then will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> himself go to <HI>allegorizing,</HI> and harp so much on a <HI>metaphorical</HI> Title! I may return him his own Reflection (<HI>p.</HI> 102.) <HI>"This "sure deserves no Answer, but</HI> only <HI>shews how necessitous your Case is, that you are so ready to catch at every Twig."</HI> And after all the <HI>"Bluster"</HI> he has made with Arguments and Testimonies, for these Angels being single <HI>Governors, Heads, Superintendents, exercising Jurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. he at last shuts up the Debate in a very modest manner. (<HI>p.</HI> 103 first <HI>Paragr.</HI>) And I shall not be backward to allow him the whole of the WHAT <HI>he contends for,</HI> as he represents it there, if I understand his <HI>Terms</HI> right: for the Gentleman seems to delight in an <HI>equivocal</HI> Stile; that I am forc'd often to guess at his Meaning. If by <HI>"Clergymen"</HI> he
<PB N="128" REF="003651_0132_10023D1F0EEBEE58"/>intends PRESBYTERS or Bishops, and DEACONS, I see no Harm in conceding, that there might be <Q><HI>more than Seven in each Church.</HI></Q> If by the Clergymen's <Q><HI>having the</HI> CARE <HI>of these Churches</HI></Q> he intends having the <HI>whole</HI> Care belonging to their respective Offices; we are willing to allow, that the DEACONS had the <HI>Secular</HI> Care, and the PRESBYTERS the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pi∣ritual</HI> and <HI>Past<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral</HI> Care. I see no Hurt to my Cause, in grant∣ing that the <HI>Asian</HI> Churches, when the Apostle <HI>John</HI> wrote to them, were <HI>"taken Care of by Presbyters",</HI> or (as his Expression is <HI>p.</HI> 62.) "<HI>were left under the</HI> GUIDANCE <HI>of them.</HI>" And I think, I may safely indulge him in his Opinion, <Q><HI>That</HI> ONE <HI>had a</HI> PREEMINENCE <HI>or</HI> PRECEDENCY <HI>to the rest</HI></Q> provided he affixes the <HI>same Ideas</HI> to these ambiguous Terms, which they carry with them when apply'd in some common Cases; as that of the <HI>Parson,</HI> in relation his <HI>Curates;</HI> and that of the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Bishops</HI> of his Province: in both which Cases, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> doubtless will hold <HI>a Preeminence or Precedency of one to the rest,</HI> yet without a Difference of <HI>Order,</HI> or substantially diverse Powers. But if this be all that the Gentleman <HI>contends for,</HI> I think in truth he contends to little purpose; unless it be to the purpose of <HI>serving</HI> his Adversary's Cause, and <HI>betraying</HI> his own.</P>
<P>Thus, I have examin'd (more largely indeed than I at first intended) those <HI>Scripture</HI>-Arguments, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has offer'd in favour of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Form of Government; and which, he says (<HI>p.</HI> 68.) he <HI>"can't but esteem incontestible Evidences."</HI> But if any unbias'd judicious Reader will have the <HI>same Esteem</HI> of 'em, after what has been said in Answer, I shall much wonder.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> IX. Upon the whole, I observe, "<HI>The Case of the Epis∣copacy of</HI> TIMOTHY <HI>and</HI> TITUS," is what my Lay-brother seems to think the <HI>plainest</HI> in <HI>Scripture,</HI> and here indeed lies his main Strength: But after all he has said, even this is far from a <HI>plain Case.</HI> The Gentleman himself appears to have <HI>lower'd</HI> his Esteem of his own Arguments, on this head, by that time he had writ on to the middle of his second Letter: For there (<HI>p.</HI> 99.) we find him speaking of 'em in more modest and dif∣fident Terms. The <HI>incontestible Evidence</HI> now dwindles away to a <HI>"Probability,"</HI> tho' (as he thinks) <HI>"a very strong"</HI> one; Yet still, I observe, it is but such a Probability <HI>"advanced at":</HI> And we all know, a <HI>very strong Probability,</HI> yea a <HI>thousand</HI> of the strongest Probabilities, are not inconsistent with the <HI>Possibility,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="003651_0132_10023D1F0EEBEE58"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay nor with even some <HI>Probabilities</HI> too, of the <HI>Contrary;</HI> and therefore can never amount to a <HI>conclusive</HI> Argument.</P>
<P>In the present Case, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> himself, as much Noise as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e makes with his <HI>incontestible Evidences</HI> for Episcopacy from Scripture, yet makes a Concession (<HI>p.</HI> 90.) That <Q><HI>some Texts seem to favour the contrary Opinion.</HI></Q> His calling in the Help of the Fathers indeed shews, he do's not think his Scripture-Argu∣ments in themselves fully <HI>demonstrative.</HI> Nay, even with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elp, in the plainest Case too, that of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etends not to strict Demonstration. His Words are (<HI>p.</HI> 99.) <Q><HI>When a Probability from Scripture, of such a Matter of Fact, is seconded by the universal Suffrage of Antiquity; it seems to me, to amount almost to a Demonstration.</HI></Q> The Gentleman, I con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, is not to be discommended for his Modesty and Caution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere. It only <HI>seems</HI> to him, to amount <HI>almost</HI> to a Demonstra∣tion; so that (make the best of it) it amounts but to a <HI>Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ability</HI> at last. But now surely something more than a <HI>faint</HI> Demonstration, or a <HI>strong</HI> Probability, is requisite to support so heavy a Weight, as this Gentleman's Doctrine (<HI>p.</HI> 84.) where he ranks <HI>Episcopacy</HI> among the <Q><HI>great</HI> ESSENTIALS <HI>of Religi∣on, about which there was always a glorious Unity among the Fathers;</HI></Q> nay, and challenges us to <Q><HI>Name the Church or Age of those primitive Times, wherein it was not esteemed a</HI> FUN∣DAMENTAL <HI>of Religion.</HI></Q> Sure I may exclaim in the Lan∣guage of his Brother <HI>Dialogist,</HI> and with greater Truth and Justice, (<HI>p.</HI> 4.) <HI>"O amazing Confidence! to say no worse."</HI> Do's this Gentleman consider what a <HI>Fundamental</HI> is! I advise him to consult the learned <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> upon the Doctrine of <HI>Fun∣damentals.</HI> (Prot. Relig. <HI>passim.</HI>) I will just give a Hint or two of that great Man's Judgment. He lays it down as a <HI>Postulatum,</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 133.) <Q>That the Knowledge of <HI>Fundamentals</HI> is drawn from SCRIPTURE.— I cannot know (says he) any Doc∣trine to be a <HI>Divine</HI> and supernatural Truth, or a <HI>true Part</HI> of Christianity, but ONLY <HI>Because</HI> the SCRIPTURE sayes so, which is all true: Therefore, much more can I not know it to be a <HI>Fundamental</HI> Truth." He observes (<HI>p.</HI> 20.) "Ve∣rities in Scripture, written <HI>because</HI> they were <HI>necessary</HI> to be∣lieved, are those <HI>only,</HI> which constitute the <HI>Covenant</HI> between God and Man in Christ. But he puts "matters of <HI>Policy</HI> and <HI>Oeconomy</HI> in the rank of Things evidently not <HI>intrinsecal</HI> to the Covenant, &amp; not <HI>in themselves</HI> necessary to be believed, but only by <HI>Accident,</HI> because they were written.—Tho' all which is <HI>necessary,</HI> be <HI>plain</HI> in <HI>Scripture;</HI> yet all which is plain,
<PB N="130" REF="003651_0133_10023D06D9DBFAD8"/>is not therefore written because it was necessary: for what Necessity, that I shou'd know <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>left his Cleak at Troas!</HI></Q> Again (<HI>p.</HI> 36.) <Q>A <HI>sure Note</HI> of a Point <HI>not necessary</HI> is, when <HI>Scripture</HI> may, with so great Probability, be alledged on both sides, that Men of <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>upright</HI> Hearts go some one way, and some another.</Q> — So (<HI>Pref.</HI> Sect 31, 33.) Those <Q>Truths are <HI>fundamental,</HI> which are EVIDENTLY delivered in <HI>Scripture,</HI> and COMMANDED to be <HI>preached</HI> to all Men: Those <HI>not</HI> fundamental, which are <HI>obsoure.</HI></Q> Now let the learned <HI>Layman</HI> reduce his Doctrine, of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> a <HI>Funda∣mental,</HI> to this Standard. Here's a short plain Test: Is Dio∣cesan Episcopacy <HI>evidently delivered in Scripture?</HI> No; for then Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> cou'd not with any Propriety have rank'd it a∣mong those <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubtful Cases,</HI> which need the Help of his 2d <HI>Rule</HI> for right interpreting of Scripture, <HI>the Sense and Practice of the primitive Fathers.</HI> And if Scripture, even <HI>interpreted by the Help of the Fathers,</HI> did afford <HI>incontestible Evidences,</HI> how comes it, the Point is so <HI>controverted</HI> among good Protestants? This is, ac∣cording to Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> one very sure <HI>Criterium</HI> of an <HI>ob∣scure</HI> Point. (<HI>Pref.</HI> Sect. 31.) <Q>There is no more <HI>certain Sign</HI> (says he) that a Point is <HI>not evident,</HI> than that <HI>honest</HI> and un∣derstanding and indifferent Men, and such as give them∣selves Liberty of Judgment, after a mature Consideration of the Matter, <HI>differ</HI> about it.</Q> And will any one have the Impudence, to say, That no <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>understanding</HI> Men can <HI>differ</HI> about this Point of <HI>Episcopacy!</HI> I now come across that bold and severe Passage of Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 70.) <Q><HI>It seems to me</HI> (says he) <HI>No</HI> HONEST <HI>Man, who knows any thing of the matter,</HI> CAN <HI>question, but that</HI> WE <HI>have the</HI> UNIVERSAL <HI>Wit∣ness of the Church of God, in every</HI> PLACE, <HI>and every</HI> AGE <HI>of the ancient Times, even from the Beginning,</HI> INTIRELY <HI>on</HI> OUR <HI>side of the Question.</HI></Q>— Still I must exclaim, with his Bro∣ther Dialogist, <HI>"O amazing Confidence! to say no worse."</HI> Pardon me, if I presume to put Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Judgment into the Scale against Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Opinion. <HI>HE (ubi supra)</HI> speaking of <Q>the <HI>obscure</HI> and <HI>controverted</HI> Questions of Religion, such as may with <HI>Probability</HI> be disputed on both sides,</Q> immediately subjoyns, <Q>SUCH <HI>are the Disputes of Protestants;</HI> — GOOD <HI>Men, and</HI> LOVERS <HI>of</HI> TRUTH, <HI>of all Sides</HI></Q> — Apply this to the Disputes between <HI>Episcopal</HI> and <HI>Antiepiscopal</HI> Protestants. Behold now the catholick Spirit and unbias'd Charity of the excellent <HI>Chillingworth!</HI> According to him there may be <HI>good Men</HI> and <HI>Lovers of Truth</HI> even among <HI>Presbyterians.</HI> Here's a
<PB N="131" REF="003651_0133_10023D06D9DBFAD8"/>just and generous Return to my Friend <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s handsome Expressions of Charity and Candour in his <HI>Dialogue;</HI> where he professes a <HI>high Value for the Church of</HI> England <HI>as a Protes∣tant Church,</HI> and <HI>a just Veneration for the Learning and Piety of some of her Bishops, and shews a Forwardness to embrace</HI> Prelaticus, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Episcopal Priest, as a truly Christian Minister, of the same Body of Christ</HI> with himself. But the Spirit, his Adversaries manifest, is quite the Reverse. All that One of them <HI>(Script.

And if our Adversaries can't produce <HI>Letters Patents</HI> from HEAVEN, to establish the Authority and Divine Right of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> Judgment must be given in our favour, and we be left to enjoy the Liberty, we claim by Divine Right.</P>
<P>But, says Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 99.) <Q><HI>Such an Evidence we have as the nature of the Thing will bear; and as much as we could reasonably expect, supposing it were so; as much as is sufficient to satisfie a wise and good Man. In a word, as much at least, as Men generally think sufficient to justifie their Belief of a great many things of this Nature,</HI></Q> &amp;c. But I answer, Supposing there were such Evidence really, as amounts to a fair and strong <HI>Probability;</HI> yet how do's this infer the indispensable <HI>Necessity</HI> of Episcopacy, and an <HI>Obligation</HI> to receive it as a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Christianity? Is a mere <HI>Probability</HI> Foundation sufficient to build an Article of <HI>Faith</HI> upon? Is the <HI>Evidence,</HI> upon which we believe a great many things of a <HI>trifling</HI> Concernment to us, sufficient to establish a <HI>Divine Institution?</HI> Or is the Evidence, upon which we may safely ground our Belief and Practice, in the <HI>Circumstantials &amp; Ceremonials</HI> of Religion, <HI>as much as is suffi∣cient to justify</HI> our Faith and Practice, in the GREAT ESSENTI∣ALS <HI>of Religion,</HI> under which head Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> annumerates <HI>Episcopacy!</HI> Is a thing of <HI>this Nature</HI> (i. e. according to this Gentleman, a thing necessary, a thing <HI>fundamental,</HI> a <HI>great Essen∣tial</HI> of Religion) to be receiv'd upon a mere <HI>probable</HI> Evidence, that will but suffice to <HI>justify our Belief of a great many things of</HI> a slight and indifferent <HI>Nature!</HI> If there be but <HI>a Probability from Scripture,</HI> what tho' it be <HI>seconded with the universal Suffrage of Antiquity!</HI> Is this <HI>sufficient Evidence</HI> for a FUNDAMENTAL <HI>of Religion?</HI> or can that be justly esteemed a Fundamental, which has no better Evidence, no stronger Motives of Credibility at∣tending it? According to Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> there are especi∣ally these Requisites to a <HI>Fundamental,</HI> That it be a <HI>necessary</HI> Truth, <HI>intrinsecal</HI> to the Covenant of Grace, <HI>evidently</HI> delivered in <HI>Scripture,</HI> and <HI>commanded</HI> to be <HI>preached</HI> to all Men; as in some Passages before ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. If this now be the Case, I must intreat our penetrating <HI>Layman</HI> to demonstrate to us, that <HI>E∣piscopacy</HI> has these Marks of a <HI>Fundamental</HI> upon it; and parti∣cularly to point us to the <HI>Scripture,</HI> where his Doctrine of
<PB N="133" REF="003651_0134_10023D089A2CF168"/>Prelacy <HI>Jure Divino</HI> is <HI>commanded</HI> to be <HI>preach'd</HI> to all Men: Or if in all his Researches into the first and purest <HI>Antiquity,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie has discover'd any <HI>Traditional</HI> Evidence of such a Command, I shou'd be glad he'd help us to it. Else this wild and novel Device, of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> a FUNDAMENTAL, will turn out a mere Trick to amuze the Unlearned, and deceive the Simple.</P>
<P>In short, when I reflect on this Gentleman's Conduct, I'm sur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riz'd at the <HI>Inconsistency</HI> of it. He makes that Pretension (<HI>p.</HI> 89.) <Q><HI>I build as much (nay</HI> MORE) <HI>on my first Rule of Interpreting of Scripture by Scripture, as on this second of Interpreting Scripture by the Help of the Fathers;</HI></Q> and yet immediately adds (so forget∣ful is he) <Q><HI>But after all your Endeavours to deface the Fathers, I cannot part with my Rule</HI></Q> (as if the Fathers were his <HI>only</HI> Rule) <Q><HI>but do still think, That the Matters of Fact, which im∣mediately ollow'd</HI> AFTER <HI>the Scriptures, are the</HI> BEST <HI>Guide in coming at the Sense of them in doubtful Cases:</HI></Q> and his manage∣ment of the Dispute in the present Case, is very much of a piece with this Declaration; the chief Run of his Arguments be∣ing on the foot of <HI>Tradition.</HI> He pretends (<HI>p.</HI> 58.) to disclaim the sense of the <HI>primitive Church</HI> under the Notion of <HI>a Rule of Faith;</HI> and yet at the same time attempts formally to prove a <HI>Fun∣damental</HI> of Christianity by the Testimonies of the <HI>Fathers;</HI> under the Notion indeed of <HI>Witnesses</HI> to the Meaning of the Rule: but this, in <HI>such</HI> a Case, is as much against the Grain, with all true <HI>Protestants,</HI> and in particular with Mr. <HI>Chilling∣worth,</HI> as is possible. This learned Man says (<HI>Prot. Relig.</HI> p. 196.) <Q>May it please you now at last, to take Notice, that by <HI>Fun∣damental,</HI> we mean <HI>all and only that which is</HI> NECESSARY.</Q> And the whole Current of his admirable Book takes its Rise from this one grand Principle, That <HI>all things necessary to Salva∣tion are</HI> EVIDENTLY <HI>contained in Scripture.</HI> And what he means by this Phrase <HI>(evidently contained in Scripture)</HI> so often used by him, we may collect from that Passage (<HI>p.</HI> 82.) <Q>The <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> is a <HI>sufficient Rule,</HI> for those to judge by, that believe it to be the Word of God, what they are to believe, and what not;— I say, sufficiently <HI>perfect,</HI> and sufficiently <HI>intelligible,</HI> in things necessary, to <HI>all</HI> that have Understanding, whether they be <HI>Learned</HI> or <HI>Unlearned</HI> And my Reason hereof (says he) is convincing and Demonstrative; because NOTHING is <HI>necessary</HI> to be believed, but what is <HI>plainly</HI> re∣vealed. For to say, that when a place of <HI>Scripture,</HI> by rea∣son of <HI>ambiguous</HI> Terms, lies <HI>indifferent</HI> between divers Senses, whereof one is true, and the other is false, God <HI>obliges</HI> Men
<PB N="134" REF="003651_0135_10023D005C0BE2C8"/>under pain of <HI>Damnation,</HI> not to mistake thro' human Frail∣ty, is to make God a <HI>Tyrant;</HI> and to say, that like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> he gives no Straw, and requires Brick; that he reaps, where he sows not</Q> &amp;c.—Nay, but Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will say, God has provided us with <HI>Guides,</HI> even the <HI>Fathers,</HI> to interpret to us the Sense of Scripture in doubtful places. To this I an∣swer again in the Language of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> (ibid.) <Q>You still run upon a <HI>false Supposition;</HI> That God hath ap∣pointed some <HI>Judge</HI> of all <HI>Controversies,</HI> that may happen a∣mong Christians, about the Sense of <HI>obscure</HI> Texts of Scrip∣ture: whereas He hath left every one to his <HI>Liberty</HI> here∣in, in those words of St. <HI>Paul, Quisque abundet suo Sensu,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> And he says (<HI>p.</HI> 74) <Q>This we know, that none is fit to pro∣nounce for all the World a judicial definitive <HI>obliging</HI> Sen∣tence in Controversies of <HI>Religion,</HI> but only such a Man, or such a Society of Men, as is <HI>authorized</HI> thereto by GOD. But we are able to demonstrate, that it hath <HI>not</HI> been the Pleasure of God to give any Man, or Society of Men, any such Authority. And therefore, though we wish heartily that all Controversies were ended, as we do that all Sin were abolisht, yet we have little Hope of the one, or the other, till the World be ended: And in the mean while, think it best to content our selves with, and to persuade others unto an <HI>Unity of Charity,</HI> and <HI>mutual Toleration;</HI> seeing God hath au∣thorized no Man to force all Men to <HI>Unity of Opinion.</HI></Q>— Words worthy to be engraven in <HI>Letters of</HI> GOLD!</P>
<P>If it be thus, why will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> talk so much of the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and go about to <HI>force all Men to Unity of Opinion,</HI> by setting up the <HI>unanimous Suffrage of the primitive Church,</HI> for a decisive Rule in doubtful Cases! At least why will he attempt to establish a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion on the Credit of their Judgment and Practice! Let our <HI>Layman</HI> take the Rebuke from that learned Hand, I have so often turn'd against him (<HI>Chill.</HI> p 242.) <Q>You bring in the Sentence of St. <HI>Cyprian;</HI> but, Why, in a Controversie of <HI>Faith,</HI> do you cite any thing, which is confessed on all hands, <HI>not</HI> to be a <HI>Rule of Faith!</HI> So (<HI>p.</HI> 266, 7.) Neither are <HI>Optatus</HI> his Sayings <HI>Rules of Faith,</HI> and therefore not <HI>fit</HI> to determine <HI>Controversies</HI> of Faith. — No Antiquity less than <HI>Apostolical,</HI> is a <HI>certain Note</HI> of Truth.</Q> If our Lay Adversary then will have <HI>Epis∣copacy</HI> to be a Matter of <HI>Faith,</HI> a <HI>great Essential</HI> of Religion, let him not refer us to <HI>Antiquity</HI> and the <HI>Fathers</HI> for Evidence: Or, if he will adhere to the <HI>Fathers</HI> in this Dispute, and cite
<PB N="135" REF="003651_0135_10023D005C0BE2C8"/>any <HI>thing which is not a Rule of Faith, and not fit to determine Controversies of Faith</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> says) let him then renounce his Notion of <HI>Episcopacy</HI>'s being a matter of <HI>Faith,</HI> a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion. I freely leave it to his Option, which to do: and if he can fairly get clear of this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> he shall be <HI>mihi magnus Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>I'm aware, it may be objected to me; But has not Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> himself publish'd, <HI>The Apostolical Institution of</HI> Epis∣copacy <HI>demonstrated!</HI> Yes, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> in his Letters menti∣on's it in this remarkable Passage (<HI>p.</HI> 86.) <Q><HI>As to Mr.</HI> Chil∣lingworth, <HI>if you have any Value for his Judgment, pray read his</HI> Demonstration of Episcopacy, <HI>which never yet was answered nor never will.</HI></Q> Well, upon his Motion, I have review'd that short Work; and I find it nothing at all to Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Purpose. For what do we read there? Truly not one Word of Episcopacy a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion! Not one Word of Episcopacy a <HI>distinct</HI> ORDER from <HI>Presbyters!</HI> Not one Word of Bishops having the <HI>sole</HI> Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Government!</HI> Not one Word in favour of <HI>Episcopal Government,</HI> but upon this <HI>Proviso,</HI> that it be "<HI>abstracted from</HI> ALL <HI>Accidentals</HI>"! And what this Expression may couch in it, he has resign'd to our own Conjectures. Nay, and when Episcopal Government is stript of <HI>all Accidentals,</HI> the upshot of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Demon∣stration, is, <Q>That it is not REPUGNANT <HI>to the Government left in the Churches by the Apostles; that it is</HI> not FORBID∣DEN, that it is not AGAINST <HI>the Apostles Doctrine and the Will of Christ:</HI></Q> All which are very lean and diminutive Ex∣pressions; and only import, that he thought <HI>some kind</HI> of Epis∣copacy <HI>lawful:</HI> which is little (if any thing) more than even <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have granted; some of whom have been for <HI>Bi∣shops,</HI> taken <HI>sano Sensu,</HI> as well as he. What an unaccoun∣table Folly then was it, to alledge Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s <HI>Demon∣stration,</HI> which makes little or nothing for Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Cause!</P>
<P>It's observable, Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> might perhaps consistently enough improve the Fathers in arguing for <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> because this was not a <HI>Fundamental</HI> or a matter of <HI>Faith</HI> with him, but merely a matter of <HI>Opinion,</HI> and <HI>extrinsecal</HI> to the Covenant of Grace; as he sometimes distinguishes. Whereas Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> makes Use of the <HI>Fathers</HI> to prove a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion; in which the <HI>Demonstration</HI> can be of no possible Service to him.</P>
<P>And now whereas Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> boasts, <HI>It never yet was answer'd, nor never will be;</HI> I believe <HI>we</HI> cou'd crack too of Books on our side, that never were answer'd, and (to
<PB N="136" REF="003651_0136_10023CF2C97708E0"/>speak modestly) <HI>it may be</HI> never will: but all the Reffection I chuse to make, is, That he happens in this Assertion to be agregiously <HI>mistaken.</HI> For, altho' that celebrated Piece can be of little Service to the Cause of Episcopacy <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> and much less to the <HI>English</HI> Prelacy, loaded as it is with a vast Aggregation of ACCIDENTALS, that Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> wou'd have thrown away; Yet such Use and such mighty Vaunts have been made of that small Performance (unworthy of the <HI>Au∣thor,</HI> and very short of its specious <HI>Title</HI>) as that several learn∣ed Pens have wrote Answers to it. It falls out, I have two of 'em by me; some Strictures by Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and a more labour'd Reply by Mr. <HI>Lander,</HI> who has taken the Pains to go through the <HI>Demonstration</HI> Paragraph by Paragraph, remarking upon every Line and Word of it, and giving a compleat Con∣futation to it.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd now to vindicate Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> and <HI>Elutheri∣us,</HI> from a Misrepresentation of the one, and an Accusation of the other, which Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> advances in the Words following the forequoted Passage (<HI>p.</HI> 86, 7.) <Q><HI>What you cite from</HI> Mr. Chil∣lingworth <HI>about some Fathers and Councils contradicting others, is evidently spoken concerning the latter &amp; corrupt Times of Popery, and not of the first &amp; purest Ages: and therefore is nothing to your Pur∣pose, but is fallaciously introduced</HI></Q> Sure I am, our Lay-Au∣thor never read Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Religion of Protestants, or else has a very bold Forhead, thus to play the old <HI>Jesuitical</HI> Game, by shifting off his Words with a feigned <HI>Distinction</HI> of Traditions. Did he imagine, by the thinnest Sophism, to cast a Mist before our Eyes! No, we have seen, Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Challenge is <HI>indefinite,</HI> to Traditions of the <HI>first,</HI> as well as later Ages, and of the <HI>purest,</HI> as well as corrupter Times. Save in that single Point, the <HI>Canon of Scripture,</HI> he challenges all Mankind to produce <HI>any other</HI> Instance of Tradition truly <HI>original, universal,</HI> and <HI>perpetual.</HI> He traces Tradition up to <Q><HI>the Times of the Apostles and our Saviour himself</HI> (p. 75) and demands, if there be ANY <HI>Interpretation of</HI> ANY <HI>Scripture, from the Apostles delivered down from hand to hand, and from age to age</HI></Q> And to let us know how fully he was resolv'd in this Point, he says to his Adversary (<HI>p.</HI> 138.) <Q>WE ARE PERSWADED, that you CANNOT of ANY Thing make it appear, that <HI>it is Tradition,</HI> but ONLY the Canon of Scripture.</Q> What could be spoken plainer, or uttered more peremptorily!</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> cited the <HI>Place,</HI> where we might find the Passages that <HI>Elutherius</HI> quoted from <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> we should
<PB N="137" REF="003651_0136_10023CF2C97708E0"/>be better able to judge upon the truth of his Charge, That <HI>"they are fallaciously introduced."</HI> However, I believe, I can ness pretty nigh whereabouts our Friend was; and in turn∣ing over the Leaves, I fix my Thumb on <HI>Page</HI> 335th. (Chap. II. <HI>Sect.</HI> 56.) where he has these Words; <Q>The BIBLE, I say, the <HI>Bible</HI> ONLY, is the Religion of <HI>Protestants!</HI> WHATSOEVER ELSE, besides IT, and the <HI>plain, irrefragable, indubitable</HI> Consequences of IT, well may they hold as a matter of <HI>OPINION;</HI> but as matter of <HI>FAITH</HI> and RELI∣GION, neither CAN they with <HI>Coherence</HI> to their <HI>own Grounds</HI> believe it <HI>themselves,</HI> nor require the Belief of it of <HI>others,</HI> without <HI>most high</HI> and MOST SCHISMATICAL <HI>Presumption.</HI> I, for my part, after a <HI>long</HI> and (as I verily believe and hope) <HI>impartial</HI> SEARCH of the <HI>true Way</HI> to eternal <HI>Hap∣piness,</HI> do profess plainly, That I <HI>cannot find</HI> ANY REST <HI>for the Sole of my Foot,</HI> but upon THIS ROCK ONLY. I see plainly and with <HI>mine own Eyes,</HI> that there are Popes a∣gainst Popes, Councels against Councels [and not only so, but as he adds] <HI>some</HI> FATHERS against <HI>others,</HI> the <HI>same</HI> FATHERS against <HI>themselves,</HI> a CONSENT of <HI>Fathers</HI> of <HI>one Age</HI> against a CONSENT of <HI>Fathers of another</HI> Age, the CHURCH of one Age against the CHURCH of another Age. TRADITIVE INTERPRETATIONS of Scripture are <HI>pretended,</HI> but there are few or NONE to be <HI>found:</HI> No <HI>Tradition,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> can derive it self from the FOUNTAIN; but may be plainly prov'd, either to have been <HI>brought in,</HI> in such an Age AFTER <HI>Christ,</HI> or that in such an Age, it was <HI>not</HI> in. In a word, there is no <HI>sufficient Certainty</HI> but of <HI>Scripture</HI> ONLY, for any CONSIDERING <HI>Man</HI> to build upon. THIS therefore, and <HI>This</HI> ONLY, I have REASON to <HI>believe.</HI></Q> — I have thus recited the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssage at large, that Readers who have not the Book, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e capable of giving their Opinion upon it, and judging be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>een Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> and <HI>Elutherius.</HI> I leave it now to every equal and intelligent Reader, and even to Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> him∣self upon second Thoughts, to say, Whether here is not as <HI>absolute</HI> a <HI>Renunciation</HI> of all <HI>Traditions</HI> in <HI>every</HI> Age, and in <HI>very</HI> Point, save that one of the Canon of <HI>Scripture,</HI> as could easily be expressed in human Language! And therefore, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink, this Gentleman is bound now in common Equity, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <HI>Adversary</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> to appear in open Court with a humble <HI>Retraxit.</HI> And indeed, I think, Justice to <HI>his own</HI> Reputation too obliges him to confess <HI>himself</HI> guilty,
<PB N="138" REF="003651_0137_10023CF52466E4B8"/>both of the <HI>Impertinency,</HI> and the <HI>Fallacy,</HI> he has charged inju∣riously upon <HI>Elutherius.</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge, Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> on some Occasions ex∣presses a Reverence for <HI>Antiquity</HI> and <HI>Tradition:</HI> but then it is Antiquity no less than <HI>Apostolical;</HI> it is Tradition truly <HI>Origi∣nal,</HI> derived thro' <HI>the Church of</HI> ALL <HI>Ages</HI> (says he, <HI>p</HI> 65.) and <Q>that <HI>Succession</HI> of Christians, which takes in <HI>Christ</HI> himself and his <HI>Apostles.</HI> Prove your Doctrine (says he) by <HI>such</HI> a Tradition, and we will yield</Q> This truly is (in Mr. <HI>Lay∣man's</HI> Language, <HI>p.</HI> 99.) <Q><HI>Evidence, as much as is sufficient to satisfie a wise and good Man.</HI></Q> For this originates with the <HI>Scripture,</HI> begins at the very <HI>first</HI> Times of the Church: and if any Tradition <HI>evidently</HI> takes its Rise <HI>there,</HI> we stand ready to receive it; Yea, if that be the Case, we shall be content without examining into the Monuments of subsequent Anti∣quity. As Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> says (<HI>p.</HI> 84.) <Q>How shall a Man possibly be able to know, whether the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath had a <HI>perpetual Succession</HI> of visible Professors, which held <HI>al∣ways</HI> the same Doctrine which they <HI>now</HI> hold, without holding any thing to the contrary: unless he hath <HI>first</HI> ex∣amined, what was the Doctrine of the Church in the FIRST Age, what in the <HI>second</HI> &amp;c? And whether this be not a more difficult Work, than to STAY at the FIRST <HI>Age,</HI> and to examine the Church by the <HI>Conformity</HI> of her Doc∣trine with the Doctrine of the <HI>first</HI> Age, every Man of ordinary Understanding may judge.</Q> Hear also what he says, (<HI>p.</HI> 80.) <Q>Believe then the <HI>Consent</HI> of Christians, which are now, and have been ever since Christ in the World, that we ought to <HI>believe</HI> CHRIST; but learn of us, what Christ said. (ye) which <HI>contradict</HI> and <HI>damn</HI> all other parts of <HI>Christendom.</HI> Why, I beseech you? Surely, if they were not at all, and could not teach me any thing, I would <HI>more easily</HI> perswade my self, that I were <HI>not to believe in Christ,</HI> than that I should <HI>learn any thing</HI> concerning him, FROM ANY OTHER than THEM <HI>by whom</HI> I believed in him: at least, than that I should learn his Religion from you; who, with <HI>forging</HI> so many false Stories, and <HI>false Authors,</HI> have taken a fair Way to make the faith of all Stories questionable:—who make a Profession of <HI>cor∣rupting</HI> all sorts of Authors; a ready Course to make it <HI>justly questionable</HI> whether ANY <HI>remain uncorrupted.</HI> For, if you take this Authority upon you, upon the <HI>Six</HI> Ages last past, HOW SHALL WE KNOW, that the Church of <HI>that
<PB N="139" REF="003651_0137_10023CF52466E4B8"/>Time</HI> did not usurp the <HI>same</HI> Authority upon the <HI>Authors</HI> of the <HI>Six</HI> last Ages BEFORE THEM, and so upwards, un∣til we come to Christ himself?</Q>—It's remarkable, what be observes (<HI>p.</HI> 261.) <Q><HI>Not any Antiquity</HI> therefore, unless it be ABSOLUTE and PRIMITIVE, is a <HI>certain</HI> Sign of a <HI>true</HI> Doctrine. For if <HI>the Church</HI> were obnoxious to <HI>Corruption,</HI> as we pretend it was: <HI>who</HI> can possibly <HI>warrant</HI> as, that Part of this Corruption might not get in, and prevail in the 5th or 4th or 3d or 2d Age? Especially seeing the Apostles assure us, that the <HI>Mystery of Iniquity</HI> was <HI>working,</HI> tho' more secretly, even in <HI>their</HI> Times. If any Man ask, How could it become <HI>universal</HI> in so <HI>short</HI> a Time? Let him tell me how the Error of the <HI>Millenaries,</HI> and the <HI>Com∣municating</HI> of <HI>Infants,</HI> became <HI>so</HI> SOON <HI>universal:</HI> and then he shall acknowledge, what was <HI>done</HI> in some, was <HI>possible</HI> in others.</Q></P>
<P>Here now, I can't but observe, Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> has by these few Lines given a home Thrust to his own <HI>Demonstration of Episcopacy.</HI> Like <HI>Samson,</HI> he has himself crush'd the Pillars, this Structure of his leans upon, and shaken it down on his head. And thus, at one Blast he has torn up the whole Foundation of Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s plausible Discourse (<HI>p.</HI> 71, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) on <Q><HI>Episcopacy an universal Matter of</HI> FACT; <HI>it's not being possible the Fathers shou'd mistake about it; nor imaginable that those holy Martyrs wou'd on purpose transmit a Lie to Posterity, without any Temptation.</HI></Q> I am sure, they had as little <HI>Temptation</HI> in the Case of Communi∣cating <HI>Infants,</HI> as in that of Dioces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Episcopacy;</HI> and it was as evidently an <HI>universal matter of Fact;</HI> and being <HI>esteemed a Divine Appointment,</HI> it was <HI>as much a Doctrinal Article, as Episcopacy.</HI> What Mr. Layman says upon a Comparison of <HI>Infant-Baptism</HI> and Episcopacy (<HI>p.</HI> 113.) I may with greater Truth say of <HI>Infant-Communicating</HI> and Episcopacy, <HI>"I can't see but that they stand upon equal Grounds."</HI> And I hope Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will not <HI>call my turning his Argument against himself impertinent:</HI> for <HI>I can't but think it very pertinent;</HI> and if he can find any <HI>Salvo at all to offer in Answer to it,</HI> I'm persuaded, it must be an <HI>exceeding lame</HI> one, a poor <HI>Come-off. In short, I think that the Use I have made of his Reasoning, will remain pertinent, till he can show,</HI> that <HI>there are stronger, clearer and earlier Testimonies for</HI> the immutable Divine Right and indispensable Necessity of <HI>Epis∣copacy,</HI> as a superior Order to Presbytery, than of <HI>Infant-Com∣municating: But this I think he can't be so vain as to pretend to.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="003651_0138_10023D20F46665F0"/>
One wou'd expect plain Testimonies in the Case of the Epis∣copacy of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> if in any Case at all. Some Pre∣tists indeed have been so satisfy'd of this, as to lay the whole Stress of the Controversy on this single Case: and 'tis with a special View to this, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> made that Remark, <Q><HI>Evi∣dence we have, as much as is sufficient to satisfie a wise and good Man.</HI></Q> We see then by the way, what <HI>Presbyterians</HI> must pass for in his Account, <HI>Fools</HI> or <HI>Knaves;</HI> but so must some even of his <HI>own Church</HI> too, as it happens; for there have been <HI>E∣piscopalians,</HI> that never cou'd be satisfy'd with the Evidence in this Case. I shall only instance in the learned Dr. <HI>Whithy,</HI> who ingenuously gives us his Thoughts in these Words (<HI>Pref.</HI> Com. in <HI>Tit</HI>) <Q>As to the great Controversy, whether <HI>Timo∣thy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were indeed made <HI>Bishops,</HI> the one of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> the other of <HI>Crete;</HI> I confess, I can find NOTHING of this matter in <HI>any</HI> Writer of the <HI>first three Centuries,</HI> nor any <HI>In∣timation</HI> that they bore that <HI>Name."</HI>— He subjoyns, "I confess, that these <HI>two Instances</HI> absolutely taken, afford us <HI>no</HI> convincing Evidence for a settled <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy.</HI></Q>— What Considence then do's it bewray, in Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> to bear us in hand, That <Q><HI>the Episcopacy of</HI> Timothy <HI>and</HI> Titus <HI>is a matter of Fact,</HI> wherein <HI>the Probability from Scripture is secended with the universal Suffrage of Antiquity!</HI></Q></P>
<P>In fine, supposing this Case were ever so clear in Antiquity, and supposing that Episcopacy was held by the primitive Church a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion (as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretends) yet I say still, what signifies <HI>the universal Suffrage of Antiquity,</HI> in relation to <HI>the great Essentials of Religion,</HI> if the <HI>Scripture</HI> is silent or obscure? How bold a Charge of <HI>Insufficiency</HI> is it, up∣on the <HI>Scripture,</HI> to hold one of the <HI>great Essentials</HI> of the Gos∣pel <HI>not evidently</HI> revealed in the <HI>Bible,</HI> but depending for its Cer∣tainty upon <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Traditions!</HI> It's a just Remark of Dr. <HI>Stillingstret</HI>'s (Irenic. <HI>p.</HI> 198.) <Q>Whatever is done with an Opi∣nion of the <HI>Necessity</HI> of doing it, <HI>destroys</HI> the Scripture's <HI>Per∣fection,</HI> if it be not <HI>contained</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> as he expresses himself be∣fore, " not <HI>fully</HI> laid down) in it: for that were to make it an <HI>imperfect</HI> Rule; and in this Sense every <HI>Additio perficiens</HI> is <HI>Additio corrumpens."</HI>—And he observes (<HI>p.</HI> 114.) "A just Ground of Separation is any thing which either directly or consequentially doth <HI>destroy</HI> any <HI>fundamental</HI> Article of Christian Faith: which may as well be done by <HI>adding</HI> to fundamental Articles, as by plain denying them. And my reason is this: because the very <HI>Ratio</HI> of a fundamental
<PB N="141" REF="003651_0138_10023D20F46665F0"/>Article doth imply, not only its <HI>Necessity</HI> to be believed and practised, but likewise its <HI>Sufficiency</HI> as to the <HI>End</HI> for which it is called fundamental.—Now he that <HI>adds</HI> any thing to be believed or done as <HI>fundamental,</HI> that is, <HI>necessary to Sal∣vation,</HI> doth thereby <HI>destroy</HI> the <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of those former Articles in order to Salvation; for if <HI>they</HI> be sufficient, how can any <HI>new</HI> ones be necessary?</Q> The same learned Hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bserves (<HI>p.</HI> 152, 3.) <Q>Supposing that <HI>Apostolical</HI> Practice be sufficiently attested by the following Ages,—tho' the matter of Fact be evidenced, yet the <HI>obligatory</HI> nature of that Fact must depend on <HI>Scripture.</HI>—And supposing any Form of Government <HI>in its self necessary,</HI> and that <HI>Necessity</HI> not de∣termined by a Law in the <HI>Word of God,</HI> the Scripture is thereby apparently argued to be <HI>insufficient</HI> for its End; for then <HI>deficit in necessarits.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Besides, as Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> (Relig. of Prot. <HI>p.</HI> 136.) says, <Q>Who can <HI>warrant</HI> us, that the <HI>universal Traditions</HI> of the Church were all <HI>Apostolical?</HI> Seeing, in that famous place for Traditions, in <HI>Tertullian,</HI> Quicunque Traditor, <HI>Any Au∣thor whatsoever is Founder good enough for them.</HI> And who can secure us that humane Inventions, and such as came <HI>à quocun∣que Traditore,</HI> might not in a <HI>short</HI> time gain the Reputation of <HI>Apostolique!</HI> Seeing the Direction then was, <HI>Pracepta Majorum</HI> APOSTOLICAS <HI>Traditiones quisque existimat.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Will Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> after this, think to establish his Episcopacy upon the Credit of Apostolic <HI>Tradition,</HI> confirming and inter∣preting the Scripture! Let him then never more alledge Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> as an Advocate for his Cause: I'm sure, 'tis such as that learned Protestant will by no means patronize.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> X. It remains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to take some Notice of those <HI>Quo∣tations,</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has offered, from the <HI>Fathers;</HI> which, he thinks, are <HI>plain Testimonies</HI> to his Purpose, and give great Light into the present Controversy.</P>
<P>Only I will first offer some Remarks on what he premises, in that occasional Passage (<HI>p.</HI> 105.) <Q><HI>As for Dr.</HI> Stillingfleet, <HI>it is very well known, that when he wrote his</HI> Irenicum, <HI>he was but a young Man, and had not ripened his Studies in Antiquity, and also that long after in his Treatise of the</HI> Mischief [I suppose he meant, <HI>The Unreasonableness</HI>] of Separation, <HI>especially in the</HI> Preface <HI>to it, he does in Effect at least, retract what he had written before. So that you have no Reason so loudly to boast of him.</HI></Q>—As to the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s writing his <HI>Irenicum,</HI> when he
<PB N="142" REF="003651_0139_10023D0B1D7C7640"/>was but a <HI>young</HI> Man, take the Remark made by one of his Contemporaries, the learned and judicious Mr. <HI>Howe</HI> (Letter upon Occasion of the <HI>Dr's Mischief of Separation,</HI> p. 32.) <Q>To say the truth, the Gravity and Seriousness wherewith that Book was written, appears to have so little of the <HI>Youth</HI> in it, in comparison of the Jocularity and sportful Humour of some of his latter Writings, when he hath been discussing the most weighty and important Cases of Conscience, that it seems as a Prodigy in Nature, and that he began his Life at the wrong End; that he was old in his Youth, and reserv∣ed his <HI>Puerility</HI> to his more grown Age.</Q>—Mr. <HI>Howe</HI> further says; <Q>I conceive, one may safely take it for grant∣ed, his Intention was not to retract the <HI>whole</HI> Book. How∣ever, his Retractation cannot make that which was <HI>true,</HI> be∣come <HI>false.</HI> The <HI>Reason of Things</HI> is sullen, and will not al∣ter to serve Men's Conveniences.</Q>—Perhaps indeed the <HI>Dr.</HI> really had <HI>chang'd his Opinion in some Things:</HI> yet I observe, he himself do's not positively affirm he had, but speaks with Caution, hypothetically (<HI>Pref,</HI> Unr. Sep. <HI>p.</HI> 76.) <Q>IF any thing in the following <HI>Treatise,</HI> be found different from the Sense of that Book</Q> &amp;c. Nevertheless he appears <HI>loth</HI> it shou'd be thought, he had alter'd his Judgment in some of the most material Points; as appears by that Expression I quoted before, (<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 72.) <Q>But after all this, wherein is it that he hath contradicted himself?</Q> I must say, if the <HI>Dr.</HI> had really chang'd his Opinion in any matters of Importance, he wou'd have shewn more of Ingenuity, by being frank and express in his Retractations, and descending to Particulars, than he has done, while he leaves us in the Dark, by lurking in Generals.

We depend not on his <HI>Authority</HI> (says Mr. <HI>Howe</HI>) but on the <HI>Reasons</HI> he alledged, which if they were fallacious, he shou'd have shewed <HI>wherein,</HI> and answer'd his own Reasons.</Q>—But since he hath not done this, I rather take it for an Argument, that the <HI>Dr.</HI> look'd on his <HI>I∣renicum,</HI> in the Substance and main Design of it, to stand good
<PB N="143" REF="003651_0139_10023D0B1D7C7640"/>still; and that in the grand Points his Judgment really con∣tinu'd the <HI>same.</HI> A Controversy indeed has been manag'd in Print, on this very Question, Whether Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> has in his latter Writings given the World sufficient Evidence of the Change of his Judgment, as to the Points of <HI>Church-Power</HI> in general, and <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in particular? between the Doctor, and Mr. <HI>Lowth,</HI> a noted <HI>Episcopal</HI> Divine. It happens, I have by me a large <HI>Letter</HI> of his to the <HI>Dr.</HI> (printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1687.) therein he professedly examines his latter Writings (particularly the <HI>Unreas. of Sep.</HI>) and brings them in for Evidence a∣gainst him. He observes, as to one important Point and mother, nearly touching the Episcopal Controversies (<HI>p.</HI> 80.) <Q>It appears, that <HI>That</HI> was not one of those Points, concern∣ing which <HI>Dr.</HI> St. <HI>saw Reason to alter his Judgment in</HI> 20 Years time.</Q> He charges him with making "the Church of <HI>England</HI> a <HI>Parliament</HI>-Church:" and tells him, his <Q><HI>Definition</HI> of it is much at the same as <HI>Socrates</HI> defin'd a Man, <HI>Homo est Ani∣mal bipes, implume. Diogenes's</HI> Jackdaw was as good a Man, when he had pluckt his Feathers off.</Q> He charges him with holding that <Q>an Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> is sufficient to constitute <HI>true Pastors;</HI> which (says he) <HI>savours</HI> too much of the <HI>old Vessel.</HI></Q> But to omit other Passages, he concludes with this, <Q>And in the last place, You have made NO Satisfaction <HI>at all</HI> to the Church of God, for that <HI>Irenicum</HI>-Doctrine, which equals the <HI>Presbyter</HI> with the <HI>Bishop.</HI> There is <HI>not</HI> ANY Thing LIKE <HI>Amends</HI> for it in ALL your Writings, that I have met with. It is true, You often speak of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> as the most <HI>ancient Government derivable from the Apostles:</HI> But you have <HI>not any where</HI> asserted it in the Number of those <HI>Institutions</HI> and <HI>Practices Apostolical, which are</HI> PERPETUAL <HI>and</HI> IMMUTABLE; and <HI>until</HI> you say THIS, <HI>all</HI> you can say <HI>besides,</HI> is to NO <HI>Purpose.</HI> The <HI>Bishop</HI> is notwithstanding, at the Mercy of your <HI>Prince</HI> or your <HI>Presbyters,</HI> when their Pru∣dence sees fit to degrade and depose him: There is <HI>no more Obligation</HI> to continue the distinct Order of <HI>Bishops,</HI> than that Order of <HI>Widows,</HI> in the Epistle to <HI>Timothy.</HI> And thus (Sir) I have shew'd, that you have not made due Satisfaction for those Errors in your <HI>Irenicum,</HI> concerning the <HI>Power of the Church in general,</HI> and the <HI>Constitution of our Church in parti∣cular.</HI></Q> How fitly may I hereupon return Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> his own Remark! <Q><HI>So that you have no Reason so loudly to boast of</HI> Dr. Stillingfleet.</Q> For ought I see, he remains <HI>ours,</HI> nigh as much as ever: We have Mr. <HI>Lowth</HI>'s Authority for it, That
<PB N="144" REF="003651_0140_10023D23ABCD2668"/>the <HI>Dr.</HI> at least has <HI>said nothing to the Purpose</HI> effectual against us. And I cannot but look upon it, as reflecting a Lustre on the <HI>Presbyterial</HI> Cause, That so great a Man, as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> first wrote very much in <HI>favour</HI> of it, when <HI>young;</HI> and then <HI>a long time after,</HI> when he had <HI>ripen'd his Studies in Antiquity,</HI> cou'd find <HI>Nothing</HI> to write in <HI>Opposition</HI> to it, that a zealous and pene∣trating <HI>Episcopalian</HI> wou'd reckon effectual <HI>to the purpose.</HI> Be∣sure Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> had more Wit, than to go our <HI>Layman</HI>'s Lengths: nor indeed has he gone much (if any thing) further, in the point of Episcopacy, than Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> who founds his whole Demonstration on a mere Presumption, and whose Episcopacy stript of <HI>all Accidentals</HI> wou'd be little more than <HI>Titular,</HI> or a <HI>Presidency</HI> of Order.</P>
<P>And now I observe, That if what Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> has ad∣vanced, might truly be said to be <HI>to no Purpose,</HI> then I'm sure, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Quotations from Antiquity may modestly enough be call'd <HI>Impertinent:</HI> while it appears, they say nothing de∣terminately of the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Episcopacy, pleaded for; nor of an <HI>original inviolable</HI> Right; much less of a <HI>fundamental Ne∣cessity,</HI> in order to <HI>Salvation.</HI> As for my own part, I frankly confess, it wou'd have made but very little Impression upon me, if every one of his <HI>Testimonies</HI> had expresly and fully vouch'd for such an <HI>Episcopacy;</HI> since he has been so far from proving from <HI>Scripture</HI> its <HI>Necessity,</HI> or even its <HI>Existence</HI> in Scrip∣ture-times. The mere Sense or Practice of the primitive Church, without evident <HI>Scripture-Authority</HI> to back it, I can never persuade my self, has Weight sufficient to determine my Belief or Practice of any Thing, as of unalterable <HI>Divine Insti∣tion,</HI> much less as one of the <HI>great Essentials of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>But supposing, Antiquity were an adequate Rule; yet nothing short of the <HI>unanimous</HI> or at least <HI>general</HI> Suffrage of Antiquity is sufficient (even according to Mr <HI>Layman</HI>) to satisfy a ratio∣nal Inquirer: but which Way can we come at this, with any <HI>Certainty!</HI> Can we safely trust to the Opinion and Report of 4 or 5 <HI>Fathers</HI> living in several distant Ages, be they ever so pious and learned, concerning <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> far remote from them, when we are left ignorant of their <HI>Veuchers,</HI> upon the Credit of which the Validity of their Testimonies depends!</P>
<P>However, supposing that in this Way we cou'd have the universal Sense and Practice of the primitive Church fully ascer∣tained to us, so as to <HI>satisfy every wise and good Man;</HI> yet of what Service will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Witnesses be to his Cause, if after all it be found, <HI>they</HI> say nothing to give Light into the
<PB N="145" REF="003651_0140_10023D23ABCD2668"/>present Question, or at least nothing decisive, to <HI>his</HI> Purpose! And I am free to declare, that according to my best Appre∣hension there is not a <HI>single Hint,</HI> in all his Train of Testimo∣nies, clearly asserting <HI>Diocesan</HI> Episcopacy, as of <HI>Divine</HI> Right, an <HI>Order</HI> superior to Presbyters, of <HI>perpetual</HI> and <HI>universal</HI> Obli∣gation, a <HI>great Essential</HI> of Religion, and of <HI>fundamental</HI> Neces∣sity; much less proving the Doctrine he advances, to be the genuine <HI>Interpretation</HI> of Scripture, in this disputed Case, by the <HI>unanimous Suffrage</HI> of the primitive Church: all which really belongs to the <HI>Thesis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has attempted to defend, tho' he was pleas'd very artfully to <HI>leave out</HI> a great part of it in his stating of the <HI>Question.</HI>—I cannot but wonder how the Gen∣tleman cou'd be <HI>so vain as to pretend</HI> DEMONSTRATION, to boast of <HI>incontestible Evidences,</HI> and <HI>duro Ore</HI> to talk of a <HI>notorious universal and glaring matter of Fact;</HI> when his Evidences (all laid together) do not amount to so much as a <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>strong</HI> PROBABILITY! Upon a careful Examination of these <HI>Testi∣monies</HI> from the Fathers, I find them either <HI>aliene</HI> to the Point in hand, or <HI>contrary</HI> to Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Side of the Question, or at least <HI>unequal</HI> to the Design he produces them upon.</P>
<P>No one of his Witnesses singly, nor all of 'em collectively, do so much as make it appear probable, That Episcopacy of the modern <HI>Diocesan</HI> Kind <HI>(de facto) universally</HI> prevail'd in the pri∣mitive Church from the <HI>Beginning,</HI> or even in <HI>their</HI> Day; much less, that <HI>(de jure)</HI> in their Opinion <HI>this</HI> Form of Government, and <HI>no other,</HI> was for ever to be us'd in the Church; and still much less, that Episcopacy was esteem'd a <HI>Fundamental of Reli∣gion</HI> by every Church and Age of those primitive Times. I might easily demonstrate this, but that it seems needless; and I think, since Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has handed to us his Quotations so <HI>naked,</HI> with little or nothing of Comment or Improvement upon 'em, I may safely venture to let 'em stand just as they are, without any Remarks of mine upon 'em Indeed I had taken the Pains to go thro' a distinct and particular Examination of them: but upon second Thoughts, for the Reason just hinted, and because I wou'd not unnecessarily add to the Lenth of this Work (which has run out to an Extent already very much ex∣ceeding my first Intentions) I chuse almost wholly to drop that part of my Performance, as well as the Remarks I've made on a Variety of incidental Passages in Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Letters.</P>
<P>Only I will in short observe thus much: That whereas this Gentleman acknowledges, under his first head of Testimonies, from <HI>Glemens</HI> (p. 106.) "<HI>The words</HI> Bishop &amp; Presbyter <HI>were</HI> NOT
<PB N="146" REF="003651_0141_10023D26BB994B30"/>YET <HI>fixed to signifie the different</HI> ORDERS,"I think he has by this one Concession invalidated, if not <HI>all</HI> his Evidences, yet some of the earliest of 'em; I mean those from <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s E∣pistles, who was contemporary with <HI>Clemens,</HI> and wrote much about the same Time: for which Cause it may justly be pre∣sumed, let <HI>Ignatius</HI> mention <HI>Bishops, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> whether 16 or 1600 times, his mentioning those <HI>distinct Names</HI> is no Argument that he speaks of <HI>three distinct Orders.</HI> Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI> tells us, <HI>that</HI> <Q>Ignatius <HI>wrote first after the Scriptures were finished</HI> A. D. 101.</Q> Whether he means, that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> were then finish'd, or that <HI>Ignatius</HI> then wrote, is uncertain. If the latter be his Meaning, it serves to shorten the Space be∣tween <HI>Clement</HI>'s writing, and <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s: or if the former, still we know, that <HI>Ignatius</HI> died within a very few Years after Scrip∣ture-times, and therefore the Date of his writing can't vary much, nor be very distant from that of <HI>Clement</HI>'s. We read in <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s History (<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 14.) That <HI>Clemens</HI> wrote his E∣pistle from <HI>Rome,</HI> of which he became Bishop in the <HI>12th</HI> Year of <HI>Domitian</HI>'s Reign: who, as some Chronologists tell us, was created Emperor <HI>A. D.</HI> 81; tho' others say, <HI>Anno</HI> 83. So that we must conclude, <HI>Clemens</HI> wrote his Epistle in or after the Year 93. if not after 95. at which time the words <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> it's confess'd <HI>were not yet fixed to signifie the different Or∣ders.</HI> And if this Change was effected at the time of <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s writing, then it must have been effected either in <HI>Clement</HI>'s Time, or <HI>presently after.</HI> But now (to make use of Mr. <HI>Chil∣lingworth</HI>'s way of arguing, in his <HI>Demonstration</HI>) between <HI>Cle∣mens</HI> and <HI>this presently after, there was not Time enough for so great an Alteration: and therefore there was no such Alteration, as is pre∣tended,</HI> in <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Time. And therefore the words <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> being confessed to remain synonimously us'd so long in the Church, must be granted also <HI>not</HI> to signify <HI>different Or∣ders</HI> in the Epistles of <HI>Ignatius: Quod erat demonstrandum</HI>— However, since this Gentleman declares his Opinion (<HI>p.</HI> 70.) <Q>That <HI>St.</HI> Ignatius <HI>is as</HI> CLEAR <HI>and</HI> FULL <HI>for the Episcopal Go∣vernment, as Words</HI> CAN <HI>express,</HI></Q> then doubtless he'll easi∣ly he able to prove from <HI>Ignatius,</HI> that Bishops, when ad∣vanc'd above the Order of Presbyters, had a <HI>new Consecration;</HI> That they had the <HI>sole</HI> Power of <HI>Ordination;</HI> and that they had <HI>such</HI> kind of <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over Presbyters, as is attributed to our <HI>English Prelacy.</HI> Sure I am, It is of great Importance to his Cause, that he inform us how the <HI>"Case stood as to these matters of Fact,"</HI> in that Father's day, being <HI>"immediately after Scrip∣ture-Tines:"</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="003651_0141_10023D26BB994B30"/>and that he give us some Evidence, that <HI>Igna∣tius</HI> held this Episcopacy a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion. I hope therefore, and I demand of him, that in his next he will fa∣vour us with some of his <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>full</HI> Proofs, under each of these heads. In the mean time, I shall think it no Presumpti∣on, to call his Quotations from <HI>Ignatius</HI> impertinent, as being perfectly consistent with <HI>the words</HI> Bishop <HI>and</HI> Presbyter <HI>not be∣ing yet fixed to signify different</HI> ORDERS.</P>
<P>Truly, I believe, Mr. <HI>Lyman</HI> will find it hard to prove, that his fixed Presidents or Bishops at first had any more Power over Presbyters, than modern <HI>Parso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of Parishes in <HI>England</HI> have over their <HI>Curates,</HI> who yet are not of a distinct Order. And tho' in Process of Time these <HI>Parochial</HI> Bishops might extend their Influence beyond the Limits of a single Congre∣gation, and even a City; yet he will find it difficult to prove, that for several Centuries they claim'd any thing beyond the <HI>Metropolitical</HI> Preeminence, which imports no other Superiority but what is held consistent with Episcopal Parity, and an Iden∣tity of Order. And I can't but observe here, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 112.) <HI>"Episcopacy was truly appointed a Remedy against Schism":</HI> which is a Concession, that seems to me to give a fatal Wound to his Cause. For if that was the Case, it must be acknowledg'd, that as the <HI>End</HI> of the Appointment certainly specifies the <HI>Na∣ture</HI> of the Episcopacy, by Consequence this makes the ancient Bishop a mere President for Order's sake; not an Ecclesiasti∣cal <HI>Monarch,</HI> but a <HI>Moderator,</HI> only <HI>Primus inter pares:</HI> Such as <HI>Peter</HI> is suppos'd to have been among the <HI>Apostles.</HI> And if it can be prov'd, that even <HI>Cyprian,</HI> the latest of his 5 Witnesses, meant nothing more by Episcopacy, than this <HI>Primacy of Order,</HI> I trust Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will freely excuse me from offering any particular Reflections on his other Testimonies of a prior Date, as being indeed altogether needless.</P>
<P>Now, among a Variety of other Quotations, that might easily be made from <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Writings, I shall single o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one remarkable Passage, which is full to my purpose, and stands in that very Discourse, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 112.) recommends to us to "<HI>read,</HI> St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s excellent Tract <HI>De unitate Ecclesiae.</HI>" The Words I refer to, are these: <HI>Loquitur Dominus ad</HI> Petrum; Ego tibi dico, <HI>inquit,</HI> quia tu es <HI>Petrus,</HI> &amp; super istam <HI>Pe∣tram</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Et iterum eidem post Resurrectionem suam dicit;</HI> Pasce Oves meas. <HI>Super Unum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>edifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siam suam.

Pag. 77. <HI>Ed.</HI> Fell. <HI>Amst.</HI> 1700.</P>
<P>The Occasion of <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s writing his Discourse <HI>of the Unity of the Church,</HI> was the Schisms made by setting up of <HI>Anti-Bishops,</HI> or one Bishop in Opposition to another, which Case happen'd both in <HI>Rome</HI> &amp; <HI>Carthage.</HI> The main Drift hereof (as an <HI>Episcopal</HI> Author represents it) is <Q>to shew the horrid Impiety of rebelling against the duely and canonically E∣lected and Ordain'd and Orthodox Bishop of any particular Church, or separating from him, or setting up as an Anti∣bishop in Opposition to him: and his first and chiefest Ar∣gument is, That our Lord founded his Church on St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and thereby instituted Episcopal Government.</Q>—The Truth is, <HI>Cyprian</HI> in his Writings very frequently alledges <HI>Peter</HI> as the first and great Example of the Episcopal Dignity, and founds the Subjection of the Presbytery to one Bishop chiefly, if not only, on that Scripture, <HI>Tu es</HI> Petrus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He do's so par∣ticularly in the Passage cited by Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> from <HI>Epist.</HI> 33. and the Quotation I have made, serves for a Commentary on that: but I'm confident, neither of'em affords any Testimony to the Cause this Gentleman is defending.</P>
<P>It seems to me, if <HI>Cyprian</HI> had believ'd Episcopacy to be by Divine Institution a Superior <HI>Order</HI> to Presbytery, he would never have contented himself with alledging this Scripture, <HI>Tu es Petrus;</HI> when he was so warmly engag'd in Defence of the Episcopal Honour, against some <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who he thought had made a bold Invasion upon it.</P>
<P>In the Passage I've quoted, we have these Things observ'd to us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cyprian</HI> says, <Q>Our Lord speaks to Peter, <HI>I say unto</HI> THEE, <HI>That thou art</HI> Peter, <HI>and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto</HI> THEE <HI>the Keys of the Kingdom of Hea∣ven</HI> &amp;c. And again to the same Person, he saith after his Resurrection, <HI>Feed my S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep.</HI> On ONE Man he builds his Church.</Q></P>
<P>This is <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s great Argument for <HI>one Bishop</HI> to a Church. The Scope of it, consider'd in its relation to the Case he wrote upon, must be this; That, as among the twelve Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> was <HI>First</HI> &amp; Chief, so among the Rulers of every Church there must be <HI>one Chief.</HI> He e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idently makes the College of
<PB N="149" REF="003651_0142_10023D0CB853FBA0"/>Apostles, and the Presbytery of a Church, <HI>parallel</HI> Cases; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unds the Preeminence of one Church-Ruler above the rest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the Example of <HI>Peter</HI>'s Precedency to the rest of the A∣postles. From whence it's obvious, <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Judgment was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, That all <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or Pastors and Teachers, are <HI>Succes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> to the APOSTLES, in those ordinary Powers given them, which wou'd be necessary for the settled State of the Church: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t still, that <HI>One</HI> among those, in every Church, shou'd have <HI>Precedency</HI> to the rest, as <HI>Peter</HI> among the Twelve.</P>
<P>Now it's well known (as I have observ'd before) that the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athers attributed a Sort of <HI>Primacy</HI> to the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> cal∣ing him the <HI>Chief,</HI> the <HI>Top,</HI> the <HI>high Honour</HI> of the Apostles, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(Dux, Praeses)</HI> and PRINCEPS <HI>Apostol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>um:</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appears, <HI>Cyprian</HI> look'd upon <HI>Peter,</HI> as holding the <HI>Primatus,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he place of <HI>President</HI> or <HI>Chairman</HI> among the Apostles; and <HI>be Church</HI> being <HI>built on the Foundation of the Apostles,</HI> among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom <HI>Peter</HI> was <HI>Chief,</HI> he seems to speak of him as in a Sense the <HI>Corner-Stone;</HI> observing, <Q>Christ said to him, <HI>Thou art</HI> Pe∣ter, <HI>and on this Rock will I build my Church:</HI> He buildeth his Church on ONE.</Q> We may well think, that <HI>Cyprian</HI> un∣derstood not the <HI>Apostles</HI> to be the <HI>Foundation,</HI> but as <HI>made Use of</HI> by Christ in <HI>building</HI> his Church: much less that he look'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Peter</HI> to be the <HI>sole</HI> Foundation, in that Sense, <HI>exclusively</HI> of the other Apostles; but only consider'd him, as the <HI>first</HI> Stone at the <HI>head of the Corner,</HI> as it were, or rather the chief <HI>Master-builder.</HI> Thus <HI>Tertullian</HI> understood those words to <HI>Peter</HI> (De <HI>Pud.</HI> c. 21.) <HI>In ipso Ecclesia extruct a est,</HI> id est, PER <HI>ipsum;</HI> The Church was built upon him, that is, <HI>by</HI> him.—And this Eminency of <HI>Peter, Cyprian</HI> makes the Pattern and Plea for the Episcopal Dignity, or Precedency of <HI>One,</HI> to the rest of the Rulers, in every Church. His words, in the Passage quoted by Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> and as translated by him, are these, <Q><HI>Our Lord being about to</HI> CONSTITUTE <HI>the</HI> EPISCOPAL HONOUR, <HI>and the frame of his Church, said to</HI> Peter, <HI>Thou art</HI> Peter <HI>&amp;c. from which the Ordination of Bishops, and Constitution of the Church does descend, through the Courses of Successions and Times; that the Church should be built upon the Bishops,</HI></Q> &amp;c. You see by these Words, <HI>Cyprian</HI> makes the <HI>Episcopal Honour,</HI> which he pleads for, to <HI>commence</HI> in the Person of the Apostle <HI>Peter;</HI> Here's the Origin of the Episcopal Preeminence, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Father. But what did <HI>Cyprian</HI> mean by this same <HI>Epis∣copal Honour,</HI> which originated in <HI>Peter?</HI> Shall we understand it, as the <HI>Papists</HI> do, of the <HI>Romish Supremacy,</HI> the universal Empire
<PB N="150" REF="003651_0143_10023D10AA43F240"/>of the POPE! Whom they hold Successor to the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> in the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and Head of all Bishops through the Church Catholick. Or shall we understand it, as Protestant <HI>Prelatist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> do, of <HI>Diocesan</HI> Episcopacy, the Government of Prelates ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Clergy in particular Churches! Sure I am, there's as little Shew of Reason for the latter, as the former: both Construc∣tions carry a Load of Absurdity with them. I desire Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI> to read judicious <HI>Hooke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Thoughts on the <HI>Popish</HI> Plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (<HI>Ser.</HI> 1. <HI>on part of</HI> Jude, <HI>Sect.</HI> 14.) and to let me know <HI>how far,</HI> he thinks, that Answer to the <HI>Papal</HI> Argument fails of being a just Reply to his <HI>own</HI> Argument for <HI>Prelacy,</HI> as grounded on the Words of <HI>Cyprian.</HI></P>
<P>This Language of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> Episcopal <HI>Honour,</HI> puts me in mind of those Passages in the <HI>Ecclesiastical Polity,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Hock∣er</HI> observes, <Q>That the Worke of <HI>external Ministerie</HI> in Bap∣tism is onely a <HI>Preeminence of</HI> HONOUR; and that it is onely for ORDER's sake in his Church, that God hath committed the <HI>Ministerie</HI> of <HI>Baptism</HI></Q> [he might by parity of Reason have added all other external Ministeries] "to <HI>special</HI> Men &amp;c. And if the <HI>Episcopal Honour</HI> did commence in <HI>Peter,</HI> as we know; none but <HI>Papists</HI> that allow <HI>him</HI> any thing more than a Priority of <HI>Order</HI> among the Apostles; so consequently it must be acknow∣ledg'd, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piscopal Honour</HI> that <HI>Cyprian</HI> pleads for, can mean nothing different, nothing transcendent to that. Surely M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Layman</HI> can't with any face plead <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Authority for any other episcopal Honour, than what corresponds to <HI>Peter</HI>'s Prima∣cy among the Apostles. Plainly, according to this Father, the Bishop is to his Presbytery, what <HI>Peter</HI> was to the Apostles; who is by <HI>Eusebius</HI> called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Prolocutor</HI> among the Apostles; and by other Fathers the Name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is frequently given him, which (says Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> Irenic. <HI>p.</HI> 214.) imports no more than <HI>Praesultor in Chorea,</HI> he that led the Dance among the Disciples. The Bi∣shops then, whose Honour <HI>Cyprian</HI> holds to be founded in the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> were but <HI>Coryplai,</HI> Arch-Bishops, or leading Pres∣byters, having a Priority or Precedency to the rest. This is the utmost we can rationally suppose intended by <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Episco∣pal Honour. Some Resemblances of it there may be in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> as in the Dignity of the <HI>Parson</HI> above his Curates; in that of the <HI>Dean,</HI> who is Head of the Chapter in Cathedral Churches; in that of other <HI>Dignitaries,</HI> above the inferior Clergy; or in that of the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> who is Ordinary to all the Bishops of his Province. I doubt not, one or other of
<PB N="151" REF="003651_0143_10023D10AA43F240"/>these Cases reaches the whole meaning of the <HI>Cyprianic</HI> Episco∣pal Honour; which most certainly was such as that Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld not destructive of Parity. For we must observe,</P>
<P N="2">2. It follows in my Quotation from <HI>Cyprian;</HI> <Q>Altho' to all the Apostles Christ gave EQUAL POWER, when he said, <HI>As the Father hath sent Me, so send I You, Receive ye the holy Ghost: If ye remit to any one his Sins, they shall be remitted,</HI> &amp;c. The SAME as <HI>Peter</HI> was, were even the other Apostles also, being EQUAL Partners both in <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI></Q></P>
<P>You see, <HI>Cyprian</HI> puts all the Apostles on a Level, as of one Order and Office; and allows no one a Superiority of Power, or essentially diverse Dignity, above the rest. What shall we make then of the <HI>Episcopal Honour,</HI> he supposes <HI>constituted, when Christ said,</HI> Thou art <HI>Peter; from whence by the Turns of Times and Successions the Appointment of Bishops hath run on?</HI> It's most evident, <HI>Cyprian</HI> holds the Apostles to be all <HI>Pares Aposto∣latu,</HI> equal in Apostolic Honour and Power; and therefore by the <HI>Episcopal Honour</HI> instituted in <HI>Peter,</HI> he must intend something consistent with the <HI>Parity</HI> he asserts: and therefore he must intend a mere Priority, Precedency, or Presidency of Order; such as is commonly practis'd in a Society of Equals, where <HI>One</HI> has something of Preeminence allow'd him, for the better Re∣gulation of Proceedings, and avoiding of Confusion I know, <HI>Cyprian</HI> says, "The Bishop has the <HI>sublime Top</HI> of the Priesthood": But this means no more than the Fathers intended, when they call'd <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Top,</HI> the <HI>high Honour,</HI> and <HI>Head</HI> of the Apostles: still asserting an Equality in Power, and Identity of Order; and therefore holding <HI>Peter</HI>'s Primacy to be but a Presidency, for Unity and Concord's sake. Of this Nature, by Consequence, very apparently and necessarily must be the <HI>Episcopal Honour,</HI> which <HI>Cyprian</HI> pleads for as <HI>descending</HI> to future Times. For <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> being the <HI>Example</HI> and first Instance of Episcopal Honour, what Prerogative <HI>he</HI> had above the rest of the Apostles, THIS and <HI>no more</HI> may the <HI>Bishop</HI> claim above the other Presbyters in his Church. Hence it appears to me demonstrated, beyond the power of Contradiction, That <HI>Cyprian</HI> believ'd the <HI>Parity</HI> of Bishops and Presbyters, as alike succeeding to the Apostles; Knowing nothing of a distinct Order of <HI>simple</HI> Presbyters (as in the Church of <HI>England</HI>) subordinate to Bishops by Divine In∣stitution.</P>
<P>It is the most glaring Absurdity, to suppose that our Lord those Words, <HI>Tu es Petrus,</HI> instituted an Imparity of Order mong the Apostles; and if not among the Apostles, then a
<PB N="152" REF="003651_0144_10023D02A2A4A318"/>(by that Argument) among the ordinary Ministers of the Gos∣pel: And unless Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will fix this Absurdity on <HI>Cypri∣an</HI> (which indeed wou'd be but to expose himself) let him never more attempt to prove <HI>Diccesan</HI> Episcopacy from any such Tes∣timonies of that Father. I'm as much mistaken, as possible in any thing, if the very Quotation he has bro't against us from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> taken in a comparative View together with that I've produc'd, do's not give as dangerous a Blow to the <HI>Prelacy</HI> he defends, as almost any thing that can be fetcht from Antiquity, or Scripture. I shall therefore without the least Anxiety, wait to see what artful Shifts he will invent, to salve a lame and wounded Cause.—And go on now to observe,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cyprian</HI> adds, <Q>Yet to declare <HI>Unity,</HI> the Lord by his Authority disposed the Original of the same Unity, begin∣ning of <HI>One.</HI>—The Beginning proceeds from <HI>Unity,</HI> to shew the Church <HI>One.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Father urges it as an Argument against <HI>Anti-Bishops,</HI> That the Church was at first built on ONE, <HI>Tu es Petrus.</HI> It's a celebrated Maxim of his in this Tract, <HI>Episcopatus est unus enjus a singulis in solidum pars tenetur.</HI> This one Episcopate he makes to begin in <HI>Peter,</HI> and from him (it seems) communicated, and branched forth. He says (<HI>Ep</HI> 43. p. 229.) <HI>Deus unus, &amp; Christus unus, &amp; una Eccle∣sia, &amp; Cathedra una super</HI> Petrum <HI>Domini voce fundata.</HI> <Q>God is one, and Christ is one, and there is one Church, &amp; <HI>one Chair</HI> founded on <HI>Peter</HI> by the Voice of the Lord.</Q> From hence he collects, there ought to be but <HI>our Bisbop</HI> in a Church. <HI>The Beginning arises from Unity, to declare the Church is one:</HI> And by the Tenor of his Discourse <HI>De Unitate Ecclesiae, Cyprian</HI> thought that <HI>one Episcopate</HI> was not only design'd as an Emblem of <HI>one Church,</HI> but also as a <HI>Means</HI> to promote Unity, Order and Con∣cord in the Church. His main Scope is, That for the avoid∣ing of Schisms and Confusions there must be one Bishop in a Church. With that View, as <HI>Peter</HI> was set over the rest of the Apostles, so in every Church there ought to be one Bishop, ac∣cording to <HI>Cyprian.</HI> But now to <HI>that End</HI> it is sufficient, if the Bishop be only a <HI>Moderator,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> was: and therefore at most <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Bishop can mean no more than a <HI>fixed</HI> Moderator; which is reconcilable with Ministerial Parity, and far distant from Ecclesiastical Monarchy. This is clearly evident from the <HI>Analogy of Difference,</HI> between <HI>Peter</HI> and the Apostles, and the <HI>Bisbop</HI> and his Presbyters.</P>
<P>I might now illustrate and confirm <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Testimony, by
<PB N="153" REF="003651_0144_10023D02A2A4A318"/>many similar Passages in other of the Fathers. But to omit all others, I shall place an Asterism on a Passage of <HI>Jerom</HI> that seems very parallel; who tho' a stiff Defender of the <HI>Equality</HI> of Bishops and Presbyters in Scripture-times, yet Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will have it (so he says, p. 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) that <Q><HI>generally speaking no Father has</HI> STRONGER EXPRESSTONS <HI>for the Imparity of them, than he:</HI></Q> To which I have a sufficient Reply made ready to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, in this Observation of his own (p. 112.) <Q><HI>It's very un∣fair to set a single Passage or unguarded Expression of an Author, against the general Current of his Writings.</HI></Q> Waving all other Remarks, I come to the Quotation from <HI>Jerom,</HI> which seems to me a good Illustration upon that from <HI>Cyprian.</HI></P>
<P>His Words are these; <HI>At dices,</HI> Super PETRUM fundatur Ecclesia: <HI>Licet id ipsum in alio loco super</HI> OMNES <HI>Apostolos fiat, &amp; cuncti Claves Regni Coclorum accipiant, &amp; ex aquo super eos Ecclesia fortitudo so∣lidetur: Tamen propterea inter Duodecim</HI> UNUS <HI>cligitur, ut</HI> CA∣PITE <HI>constituto,</HI> SCHISMATIS <HI>tellatur Occasio,</HI> &amp;c. (Hieron adv. <HI>Jovin.</HI> l. 1.) He is in that place hotly contending for the Ho∣nour of the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> and commends him above the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> because <HI>Peter</HI> was a marry'd Man, but <HI>John</HI> a Virgin. In the Warmth of Debate, <HI>Jerom</HI> raises this Objection against himself; "But you will say, <HI>The Church is founded upon</HI> Peter": to which he replies; <Q>Albeit in another place the very <HI>same</HI> is done upon ALL the Apostles, and all receive the <HI>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and on them EQUALLY the Firmness of the Church is established: Nevertheless among the <HI>Twelve</HI> ONE is chosen out, for this End, That a HEAD be∣ing constituted, Occasion of SCHISM may be taken away. <HI>But why was not</HI> John, <HI>being a Virgin, chosen?</HI> Seniority had the Preeminence given to it; because <HI>Peter</HI> was a Man in Years: that a mere Youth, and one but a Boy almost, shou'd not be preferred above Men advanc'd in Life</Q> Up∣on which I remark, in the words of Bishop <HI>Jewel</HI> (Reply, <HI>p.</HI> 190.) <Q>St. <HI>Hierome</HI> agreeth thorowly with St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> That <HI>for avoiding of Schisms, one high Priest, that is to say, one Bishop, was by good Policie appointed</HI> &amp;c— To the like purpose St. <HI>Hierome</HI> writeth upon the Epistle unto <HI>Titus</HI> (cap. 1.) <HI>These Things have I spoken, to the Intent to shew, That in old time</HI> Priests <HI>and</HI> Bishops <HI>were all one: but that in Processe and by De∣grees the whole Charge was brought unto one Man, that the Oc∣casions of Dissensions might be rooted out.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus, in the Judgment of Bishop <HI>Jewel,</HI> there was an Agree∣ment of Thoughts, between <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Jerom,</HI> as to the Rise,
<PB N="154" REF="003651_0145_10023D2B1A271568"/>Nature, and End of the ancient Episcopacy. They both make it <HI>design'd</HI> as a <HI>politick</HI> means for the Prevention of <HI>Schisms</HI> and Distensions: they both make <HI>one</HI> single Person the Subject or Recipient of it: They both make <HI>Peter</HI>'s Preeminence among the Apostles the <HI>Exemplar,</HI> which after-ages took Copy from: <HI>Cyprian</HI> makes the Bishop but <HI>summus Sacerdos,</HI> the <HI>Chief</HI> of the Order of <HI>Priests</HI> or Presbyters, and <HI>Jerom</HI> asserts the actual <HI>E∣quality</HI> of Bishops and Presbyters in <HI>old time.</HI> And therefore, it is a rational and necessary Inference upon the whole, That the ancient Episcopacy was at first, both in Intention and Fact, but a <HI>Moderatorship,</HI> or Presidency of Order: and tho' by <HI>Degrees</HI> almost the <HI>whole</HI> Pastoral <HI>Charge</HI> might come at Length to be devolv'd on the Priest, call'd <HI>Episcopus,</HI> or Bishop, by way of Eminence; Yet this was consider'd only as a lawful Expe∣dient for the Good of the Church, and never pretended to be founded on a <HI>Divine Right</HI> in the <HI>Bisbop,</HI> by virtue of any <HI>distinct Commission,</HI> to a Superiority of <HI>Power</HI> over the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as an <HI>inferior Order</HI> by Christ's Institution: the <HI>Presbyters</HI> being only under a prudential <HI>Restriction</HI> in the Exercise of those Powers, which <HI>Jure originali</HI> they stood intitled to in common with the Bishop. Consider the Case of <HI>Peter,</HI> as Head of the Apostles, and it gives you an exact Idea of the <HI>Cyprianic</HI> Bishop.</P>
<P>Now, to sum up my Argument: If the <HI>Episcopal Honour</HI> was instituted in the Apostle <HI>Peter;</HI> and Bishops have no Right to any more Power over Presbyters, than <HI>he</HI> had over the rest of his Brethren: And if the rest of the Apostles were the <HI>same that</HI> Peter <HI>was, endued all with equal Fellowship, both of Honour and Power;</HI> but <HI>he</HI> chosen out, as a <HI>President,</HI> and appointed the First and Chief, for <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Order</HI>'s sake; Then it is clearly the Judgment of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> that the Difference between Bishops and Presbyters is not <HI>specifick,</HI> but only <HI>gradual,</HI> and consistent with the Sameness of Order. And by Consequence Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI> is guilty of a gross Imposition upon the unlearned Reader, and an equal Abuse of that good Father; when he vouches him as a <HI>Witness</HI> in the Cause of <HI>modern</HI> Prelacy, which differs from the <HI>ancient</HI> Episcopacy <HI>toto Coelo,</HI> the whole Heavens over.—Will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretend to know what was the primitive Episcopa∣cy, better than <HI>Cyprian!</HI> who (as himself observes, <HI>p.</HI> 108.) <Q><HI>lived within</HI> 150 <HI>Years after the Apostles,</HI> A. D. 250. <HI>and know as well what they appointed, as we do what was done in</HI> Queen Elisabeth's <HI>Days.</HI></Q> Will this Gentleman face down <HI>the good old Father,</HI> That Bishops are by divine Right a superior <HI>Order</HI> to Presbyters, having <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over them; and attempt too
<PB N="155" REF="003651_0145_10023D2B1A271568"/>to support his Tenet with numerous Arguments from <HI>Scripture,</HI> and Citations even from <HI>Cyprian</HI> himself! when yet that learn∣ed Father knew no better Scripture-Argument for Episcopacy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han <HI>Tu es Petrus,</HI> and evidently makes the <HI>Episcopal Honour</HI> nothing more than <HI>Peter</HI>'s Primacy, and therefore only a Pre∣sidency, not subversive of Parity: in which he has the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrence of <HI>Jerom,</HI> and I doubt not the <HI>general Suffrage of An∣tiquity.</HI> I will then presume to retort on Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> in his own words (<HI>p.</HI> 98, 9.) which I may repeat with as much Truth the deliver'd them, and they carry as good force of Argument in my Application of 'em, as in his: <Q><HI>All Antiquity with one Voice say, it was so; You do but say, and not prove, that it was not so: Their Authority is, I think, as good as yours; and in∣deed at least as much better, as they lived nearer those Times than you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having thus disarmed our <HI>Lay-Adversary</HI> of all Pleas from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> the Witness he so loudly boasted of, I think I have done enough to abate his Confidence in <HI>Antiquity,</HI> and to vin∣dicate my Friend <HI>Elutherius</HI> from the abusive Charge of <HI>noto∣rious Falshood</HI> bro't against him, in relation thereto, as hinted in the beginning of these Papers. <HI>Cyprian</HI> being remov'd out of the way, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Specimen of Collections loses its Strength and Terror: his whole <HI>Nubes Testium,</HI> exhal'd from Antiquity, dissolves and vanishes, without shooting out any Lightnings or Arrows to do us Harm.</P>
<P>I shou'd have proceeded now to vindicate the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Allegations from <HI>Antiquity,</HI> against the Exceptions and Cavils of Mr. <HI>Layman.</HI> (p. 109, &amp; <HI>alibi.</HI>) But after the foregoing Re∣flections, I think it needless, and am willing to let them have their Fate: Because, tho' <HI>we</HI> had not so much as one con∣clusive Argument from Antiquity, still if <HI>be</HI> can advance none on <HI>his</HI> side better, than what he has offer'd in his <HI>small Specimen,</HI> out Cause will be in no great Hazard. Besides, the <HI>Onus prohandi</HI> lies on the affirmative Side.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will no more object to us (as in <HI>p.</HI> 109.) <HI>"You produce</HI> Jerom, <HI>a comparatively modern Father";</HI> since what I have alledg'd from him, is but a parallel Passage to that from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> which I trust Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will enumerate among <HI>"the Testimonies of genuine Antiquity."</HI></P>
<P>I hope too, that Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will no more object to us (as in <HI>p.</HI> 97.) That they are only <HI>"some warm unguarded Expressions,</HI> wherein <HI>Jerom</HI> may <HI>seem to degrade Bishops into a Parity with Pres∣byters";</HI> since it appears, there was such a Harmony between that
<PB N="156" REF="003651_0146_10023D0F0E07B878"/>Father and the so much magnify'd <HI>Cyprian,</HI> in their Sentiments about the ancient Episcopacy. It is not <HI>Jerom</HI> alone, who tells us that Presbyters are <HI>loco Apostolorum,</HI> in the Apostles stead: but as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> observes (<HI>Ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nic</HI> p. 308.) <Q>Even <HI>Cyprian</HI> who pleads so much for Obedience to the Bishops as they were then constituted in the Church, yet speaks often of his <HI>Compresbyteri</HI> (Fellow-Presbyters) and in his Epistle to <HI>Florentius Pupianus</HI> who had reproached him, speaking of those words of Christ, <HI>He that heareth you, heareth me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Qui dicit ad Apostolos, ac per hoe ad omnes Praepositos qui A∣postolis vicaria Ordinatione succedunt</HI> (Ep. 69. <HI>Ed.</HI> Pamel. <HI>s.</HI> 4.) where he attributes Apostolical Succession to all that were <HI>Praepositi,</HI></Q> which Name [tho' Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> citing the same Passage, p. 108. appropriates it to <HI>Bisbots,</HI> yet Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> observes, it) <Q>implies not the Relation to <HI>Presbyters</HI> as over them, but to the <HI>People,</HI> and is therefore common both to <HI>Bisbops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters;</HI> for so afterwards he speaks, <HI>Nec Fra∣ternitas habuerit Episcopum, nec Plebs Praepositum,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole I observe, The Testimony of one single Bi∣shop against the Imparity of Order between Bishops and Pres∣byters, by Divine Institution, is of more Importance and Va∣lidity than Ten for it; in as much as it is rational to suppose, that none will object against the Authority they are in, or de∣tract from it, but such as make more Conscience of the Truth, than of their own Honour and Interest.</P>
<P>And (in Mr. <HI>Tong</HI>'s words) <Q>I wou'd lay down this, as a just Remark upon these Proofs out of Antiquity, That <HI>one</HI> Passage which expresly tell us, <HI>what kind of Superiority</HI> Bi∣shops had in primitive times over Presbyters, and <HI>how they came by it,</HI> is of <HI>more Value</HI> in this Controversy, than a <HI>Score</HI> that barely mention that Superiority: the one speaks di∣rectly to the Question, the other not. We acknowledge those whom the Fathers call Bishops, had some kind of Su∣periority, over those called Presbyters; and it is a vain thing for Persons to sweat and toil, in proving that which we never deny, but will grant them at the first Demand, but the Controversy turning upon this very Hinge, whether it was a Superiority of <HI>Order</HI> by <HI>Divine</HI> Institution, those An∣cients that speak purposely to this Point, are the most proper Evidences in this Cause.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XI. I shall now finish with some Remarks on Mr. <HI>Lay∣man</HI>'s Manner of <HI>concluding</HI> his LETTERS; that is, with an
<PB N="157" REF="003651_0146_10023D0F0E07B878"/>Exhortation to <HI>Charity,</HI> a <HI>Vying</HI> with us on that head, and a Testimony against the <HI>unreasonably severe and hot Expressions</HI> of uncharitable Writers, on either side. (<HI>p.</HI> 76. and 114.)</P>
<P>I heartily joyn with him in the Recommendation of <HI>Charity, Meekness, and Moderation, which so become Christians.</HI> But I wish the Gentleman had been more <HI>consistent</HI> with himself: for in the very same Breath, while he applauds and urges Charity and Moderation, he exposes himself as miserably defective in these Christian Virtues: and while he pretends to be <HI>"sorry if any of the Church shou'd, at any time, treat any of us with Indecency,"</HI> he at the same time falls soul of us, in a most indecent manner, taxing our <HI>"Ministry &amp; Sacraments</HI> as <HI>at least</HI> EXTREMELY <HI>irre∣gular"</HI> (p. 114.) and implicitly pronouncing us "HERETICKS and SCHISMATICKS, worthy to be <HI>cast out of the universal Church"</HI> (p. 71.) yet he has the face to boast (p. 76.) <Q><HI>We have at least as much Charity for you, as you have for us; for you think us to be as much out of the Way, as we think you are:</HI></Q> But this the Gentleman himself confutes, by his own Plea from the <HI>safer Side</HI> (p. 115.) where he observes, <Q><HI>You allow our Orders to be good, our Bishops being at least Presbyters; whereas we dispute yours—: and if your Presbyters are not Bisbops, it is certain they are but</HI> LAYMEN, <HI>and therefore cannot ordain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I leave every one to judge, who it is that errs most on the censorious &amp; damning side. I think truly this Gentleman seems to breath very much the Spirit of the old <HI>Donatists,</HI> so infamous in the primitive Church for their <HI>stingy narrow</HI> Principles, and the <HI>edious</HI> Practices of <HI>Re-baptizing</HI> the Proselytes to their Party, as being no Christians before, and <HI>Re-ordaining</HI> of Ministers that came over to them, as being no Ministers before; <HI>Confining</HI> the true Church to their <HI>own Communion,</HI> and <HI>unchurching</HI> all the other Churches of the Christian World. If St. <HI>Austin</HI> cou'd lift up his Voice from the Grave, how wou'd he thunder at these Episcopal <HI>Donatists!</HI> Yet it may be <HI>they wou'd not be per∣suaded, tho' one shou'd</HI> even <HI>rise from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>I conclude with those excellent Remarks of the catholick and charitable Mr. <HI>Chilling worth.</HI> <Q>The <HI>over-valuing</HI> of the Dif∣ferences among Christians (says he, <HI>Relig.
