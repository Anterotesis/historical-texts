<MILESTONE N="4"/> And having assembled

<MILESTONE N="5"/> but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And when they were come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the Kingdom to Israel?
<MILESTONE N="7"/> But he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But ye shall receive power, the Holy Ghost being come upon you, and shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> and to the uttermost part of the earth. And having spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.

<MILESTONE N="11"/> This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall come, as ye have seen him going into heaven.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey.</P>

<MILESTONE N="17"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joel</HI> ii. 28.@</NOTE> And it shall come to pass in the last days, faith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see vi∣sions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
<PB N="10" REF="046352_0009_102109E1D19E7B98"/>And in those days I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and upon my handmaids,

<MILESTONE N="22"/> Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man pointed out to you of God, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as your∣selves also know:
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Him, being delivered by the determinate council and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands, have crucified and slain:
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was not possible that he should be held under it.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> For David speak∣eth concerning him,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xvi. 8.@</NOTE> I have seen the Lord al∣ways before my face, for he is on my right-hand, that I may not be moved.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue exulteth; yea, and my flesh shall rest in hope.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy by thy countenance.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> Men <HI>and</HI> brethren, I may say to you freely of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is a∣mong us to this day.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Therefore being a prophet,
<PB N="12" REF="046352_0011_102109E740426800"/>and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, That of the fruit
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxxxix. 4, &amp;c.@</NOTE> of his loins <HI>one</HI> should sit on his throne,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> He foreseeing <HI>this,</HI> spake of the resurrection of Christ, That his soul was not left in Hades,
<MILESTONE N="32"/> neither did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God hath raised up, whereof all we are wit∣nesses.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> Being therefore exalted by the right-hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> For David is not as∣scended into the heavens; but he saith himself,
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> cx. 1.@</NOTE> The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right-hand,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> Until I make thine enemies thy foot∣stool.
<MILESTONE N="36"/> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, That God hath made this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</P>
<P>And hearing <HI>this,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="37"/> they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Bre∣thren,
<MILESTONE N="38"/> what shall we do? And Peter said, Re∣pent,
<PB N="13" REF="046352_0012_102109E9DA65E770"/>and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus, for the remission of Sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> For the Promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.
<MILESTONE N="41"/> Then they, gladly re∣ceiving his word, were baptized; and there were added <HI>to them</HI> that day about three thousand souls. And they continued steadfast in the teaching of the apo∣stles,
<MILESTONE N="42"/> and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.
<MILESTONE N="43"/> And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles. And all that believed were together,
<MILESTONE N="44"/> and had all things common,
<MILESTONE N="45"/> And sold their possessions and goods,
<PB N="14" REF="046352_0013_102109F0078D74D8"/>and divided them to all,
<MILESTONE N="46"/> as any one had need. And continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking the bread at home, they partook of their food with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God,
<MILESTONE N="47"/> and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were saved.</P>

<MILESTONE N="3"/> And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold till the next day:

<MILESTONE N="5"/> And on the morrow were gathered together at Jerusalem their rulers,

<MILESTONE N="7"/> And having set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name,

<P>And seeing the boldness of Peter and John,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and understanding that they were illiterate and un∣educated men, they marvelled, and took know∣ledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. And beholding the man who had been healed standing with them,

<MILESTONE N="17"/> Yet that it spread no farther among the people, let us severely threaten them, that they speak no more to any man in this name.

<MILESTONE N="5"/> but to God. And Ananias hearing these words, fell down and expired; and great fear came on all that heard these things.
<PB N="23" REF="046352_0022_10210A0AA84036E8"/>And the young men rising up,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> wound him up, and carrying <HI>him</HI> out,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> came in. And Pe∣ter said to her, Tell me, if ye sold the land for so much?
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And she said, Yea, for so much. And Peter said to her, Why have ye agreed together, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of them that have buried thy h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>are</HI> at the door,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> and shall carry thee out. And immediately she fell at his feet and expired; and the young men coming in, found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>ead, and carrying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> buried her by her husband. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sear came upon all the church, and upon all that heard these things.</P>
<P>And many signs and wonders were wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico: And none of the rest durst join themselves to them;
<MILESTONE N="13"/> but the people magnified them,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And the more were multitudes, both of men and women believing, added to the Lord:)
<MILESTONE N="15"/> So that they brought out the sick along the streets, and laid <HI>them</HI> on beds and couches, that even the shadow of Peter coming by, might overshadow some of them.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And multitudes also of the cities round about, came together to Jerusalem,
<PB N="24" REF="046352_0023_10210A0C71037470"/>bringing persons sick and troubled by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</P>
<P>But the high priest arising,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> and all that were with him, which was the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with zeal,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them into the common prison.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But an an∣gel of the Lord opened the prison-doors, by night, and leading them out,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> said, Go, stand and speak in the temple the words of this life.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And hearing this, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, called together the council, even the whole senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> to have them brought. But when the officers came, they found them not in the prison; and returning they said,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Truly we found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing before the doors; but having opened <HI>them,</HI> we found no man within.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> When the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> what this should be? Then came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. Then the captain going with the officers brought them,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And having brought them, they set <HI>them</HI> before the council.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And the high priest asked them, Did not we strictly command you, Not to teach in this name? And so, ye have filled Jerusa∣lem with your doctrine, and would bring the
<PB N="25" REF="046352_0024_10210A0FA23314C8"/>blood of this man upon us.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> Then Peter and the <HI>other</HI> apostles answering said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging <HI>him</HI> on a tree.
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Him hath God exalted, a Prince and a Savi∣our, with his right-hand, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> And we are witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> When they heard this, they were cut <HI>to the heart,</HI> and took counsel to slay them.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> But a certain Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honour by all the people, rising up in the council, ordered, to put the men out a little space:
<MILESTONE N="35"/> And said to them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, what ye are about to do, touching these men.
<MILESTONE N="36"/> For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred, who was slain, and all who hearkened to him,
<PB N="26" REF="046352_0025_10210A144CD700A8"/>were scattered and came to nothing.
<MILESTONE N="37"/> After this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the in∣rolment, and drew away much people after him; he also perished, and all who had hearkened unto him, were dispersed.
<MILESTONE N="38"/> And now I say to you. Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men,
<MILESTONE N="39"/> it will come to nought. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, <HI>and take heed</HI> lest ye be found even fighting against God.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> And to him they agreed. And having called the apostles, and scourged <HI>them,</HI> they charged <HI>them</HI> not to speak in the name of Jesus,
<MILESTONE N="41"/> and dismissed them. And they de∣parted from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
<MILESTONE N="42"/> And they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ daily, in the temple, and from house to house.</P>

In answer to this accusation, rehearsing as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Articles of his historical Creed, he speaks of GOD with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>high Reverence, and a grateful Sense of a long Series of Acts of Good∣ness to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and of <HI>Moses</HI> with great Respect, on account of his important and honourable Employments under GOD: Of the Temple with Regard, as being built to the Honour of God; yet not with such Superstition as the <HI>Jews;</HI> putting them in Mind, That no Temple could comprehend GOD—And he was going on, no Doubt, when he was interrupted by their Clamour, to speak to the last Point, The Destruction of the Temple, and the Change of the Law by <HI>Christ. Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken</HI>—The Sum of his Discourse is this; I acknowledge the Glory of GOD revealed to the Fathers, ver. 2; the Calling of <HI>Moses;</HI> ver. 34, &amp;c. the Dignity of the Law, ver 8, 38, 44; the Holiness of <HI>this place,</HI> ver. 7, 45, 47. And indeed the Law is more antient than the Temple; the Promise more antient than the Law. For GOD shewed himself the GOD of <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> and their Children freely (ver. 2. &amp;c. 9. &amp;c. 17, &amp;c. 32, 34, 35.) and they shewed Faith and Obedi∣ence to GOD. (ver. 4, 20. &amp;c. 23.) particularly by their Regard for the Law, (ver. 8.) and the promised Land, (ver. 16.) Meantime GOD, never confined his Presence to this one Place or to the Obser∣vers of the Law. For He hath been acceptably worshipped, before the Law was given, or the Temple built, and out of this Land, (ver. 2. 19, 33, 44.) And that our Fathers and their Posterity were not tied down to this Land, their various Sojournings (ver 4, &amp;c. 14, 29, 44.) and Exile (ver. 43.) shew. But you and your Fathers have always been evil; (ver. 9.) have withstood <HI>Moses,</HI> (ver. 25, &amp;c. 39, &amp;c.) have despised the Land, (ver. 39.) forsaken GOD, (ver. 40, &amp;c.) superstitiously honoured the Temple, (ver. 48.) resisted GOD and his Spirit, (ver. 50.) killed the Prophets and the <HI>Messiah</HI> Him∣self, (ver. 51.) and kept not the Law, for which ye contend ver. 53.) Therefore GOD is not bound to you; much less to you alone. And truly this solemn Testimony of <HI>Stephen</HI> is most worthy of his Character, as <HI>a man full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith and power:</HI> in which tho' he does not advance so many regular Propositions, con∣tradictory to those of his Adversaries, yet he closely and nervously answers them all. Nor can we doubt but he would, from these Premisses, have drawn Inferences touching the Destruction of the Temple, the Abrogation of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law, the Punishment of that rebellious People: and above all, touching <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> had not his Discourse been interrupted by the Cla∣mours of the Multitude, stopping their Ears, and rushing upon him. <HI>Men, brethren, and fathers</HI>—All who are here present whether ye are my Equals in Years, or of more advanced Age.

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>And at that time there arose a great persecution against the Church which was in Jerusalem. And they were all dispersed thro' the countries of Judea and
<MILESTONE N="1"/> <PB N="37" REF="046352_0036_10210A3221C9A498"/>Samaria,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> except the apostles. And devout men bu∣ried Stephen,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> and made lamentation over him. But Saul made havock of the church, entering into every house, and hauling men and women, committed <HI>them</HI> to prison.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Therefore they that were dispersed went every where, preaching the word.</P>
<P>And Philip coming down to a city of Samaria,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> prea∣ched Christ to them.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And the people with one accord gave heed to the things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that had them, and many sick of the palsy and lame were healed.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And there was great joy in that city. But a certain man,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> named Simon, had been before in the city, using magic, and astonishing the Samari∣tans,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> saying, that he was some great one. To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> This man is the great power of God. They gave heed to him, because he had a long time astonish∣ed them with witchcraft.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> But when they believed Philip, preaching the things of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he continued with Philip,
<PB N="38" REF="046352_0037_10210A3579942878"/>and was astonished, beholding the signs and mighty miracles which were done.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And the apostles who were at Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had receiv∣ed the word of God, sent to them Peter and John: Who being come down,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they had been bapti∣zed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And Simon seeing that thro' laying on of the hands of the apostles the Holy Ghost was given,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> offered them money,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought to pur∣chase the gift of God with money.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Thou hast nei∣ther part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> For I see thou
<PB N="39" REF="046352_0038_10210A3A49763DC0"/>art in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity. And Simon answering said,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken, may come upon me.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> They then having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned toward Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</P>
<P>And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> saying, Arise, and go toward the south by the way leading down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And lo! an Ethiopian, an eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> read the prophet Isaiah. Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> And Philip running to him, heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
<MILESTONE N="31"/> And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me? And he desired Philip to come up,
<MILESTONE N="32"/> The portion of scripture which he was reading was this,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> liii, 7.@</NOTE> He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before
<PB N="40" REF="046352_0039_10210A3BD183CB90"/>his shearer,
<MILESTONE N="33"/> so he opened not his mouth. In his hu∣miliation his judgment was taken away; and who shall declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> And the eunuch answering Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> or of some other man? Then Philip open∣ing his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached Jesus to him.
<MILESTONE N="36"/> And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said, Behold, water: what hindereth me to be bapti∣zed?
<MILESTONE N="37"/> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
<MILESTONE N="38"/> And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Cesarea.</P>

<MILESTONE N="3"/> he drew near Damascus; and suddenly there shone about him a light from heaven. And falling to the earth,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> he heard a voice saying to him,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. <HI>It is</HI> hard for thee to kick against the goads.

<MILESTONE N="8"/> but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought <HI>him</HI> into Damascus.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And he was three days
<PB N="42" REF="046352_0041_10210A43F1EB4FE8"/>without sight,

<MILESTONE N="11"/> Behold I <HI>am here,</HI> Lord. And the Lord <HI>said</HI> to him, Arise, go into the street called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas, for <HI>one</HI> named Saul of Tarsus;
<MILESTONE N="12"/> for behold, he is praying. And he hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he may recover his sight.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And here also he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> But the Lord said unto him, Go: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before nations and kings,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> and the children of Israel. For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And Ananias went and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Bro∣ther Saul, the Lord hath sent me, Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, that thou mayst reco∣ver thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately as it were scales fell from his eyes,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> and he recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized. And having received food he was strengthened.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And he was certain days with the disciples in Damas∣cus:
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And straight-way he preached Jesus in the synagogues,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> that he is the Son of God. But all that
<PB N="43" REF="046352_0042_10210A4580BFE8E8"/>heard were amazed, and said, Is not this he who de∣stroyed those that call on this name in Jerusalem? And came hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?
<MILESTONE N="22"/> But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> proving that this is the Christ. And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But their lying in wait was known by Saul: and they guarded the gates day and night to kill him.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Then the disciples taking him by night,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> let <HI>him</HI> down the wall in a basket. And coming to Jerusalem, he endeavoured to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> But Barnabas taking him, brought <HI>him</HI> to the apostles, and declared to them, How he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> in the name of Jesus, And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem. And preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> he spake and disputed with the Hellenists: but they attempted to kill him:
<MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Which</HI> the brethren knowing, brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Then the church through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria had peace: and being built up, and walking in the fear of God, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, <HI>was</HI> multiplied.</P>
<P>And as Peter passed through all <HI>parts,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="32"/> he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> And he found

<MILESTONE N="34"/> being ill of a palsy. And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> And he arose immediately, And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw <HI>him,</HI> and turned to the Lord.</P>
<P>Now there was at Joppa,
<MILESTONE N="36"/> a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did.
<MILESTONE N="37"/> And in those days she was sick and died; whom having washed, they laid in an upper chamber. And Lydda being near Joppa,

<MILESTONE N="39"/> Then Peter arose and went with them; whom being come, they brought into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made, while she was with them.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> But Peter having put them all out, kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> And there was a certain man in Cesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that called the Italian band,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> A devout <HI>man,</HI> and fearing God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> He saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And looking steadfastly on him, and being affrighted, he said, What is it, Sir? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And now send men to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> whose house is by the sea. And when the angel who spake to him was departed, he called
<PB N="46" REF="046352_0045_10210A4EBA30A6F8"/>two of his houshould-servants, and a devout soldier, of them that waited on him continually:
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And having declared all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> On the morrow, as they journeyed and drew nigh to the city, Peter went up on the house-top,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> to pray, about the sixth hour. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, And saw heaven opened,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> and a certain vessel like a great sheet, tied at the four corners, descending, and let down on the earth:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Wherein were all four-footed creatures, and creeping things of the earth,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and fowls of the air. And a voice came to him,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Rise, Peter, kill and eat. But Peter said, In no wise, Lord: for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And the voice <HI>came</HI> to him again, the second time, what God hath pu∣rified,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> call not thou common. This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again to heaven. Now while Peter doubted in himself,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> what the vi∣sion he had seen should mean, behold the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired out Simon's
<PB N="47" REF="046352_0046_10210A505DEE0878"/>house,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> stood at the gate. And calling asked, Whether Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there? While Peter was musing on the vision,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> the Spirit said to him,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Behold, men seek thee. Arise there∣fore and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing;
<MILESTONE N="21"/> for I have sent them. Then Peter going down to the men, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: for what cause are ye come? And they said,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Cornelius a centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear words from thee.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And he invited them in and lodged <HI>them.</HI> And the next day, rising up, he went away with them; and certain brethren from Joppa went with him.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And the day follow∣ing they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and near friends.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> And as Peter was com∣ing in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet▪
<MILESTONE N="26"/> worshipped <HI>him.</HI> But Peter raised him up,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> saying, Arise: I myself also am a man. And as he talked with him, he went in and found ma∣ny come together.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And he said to them, Ye know it is unlawful for a Jew to join with or come to one of another nation; but God hath shewed me,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> to call no man common or unclean. There∣fore being sent for, I came without gain-saying.
<PB N="48" REF="046352_0047_102107AD851FD038"/>I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me?
<MILESTONE N="30"/> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> And said, Corne∣lius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are re∣membred before God.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea, who being come,
<MILESTONE N="33"/> shall speak to thee. Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee by God.</P>
<P>Then Peter opening <HI>his</HI> mouth,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> said, I perceive of a truth that God is not a respecter of persons: But in every nation,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness,
<MILESTONE N="36"/> is accepted by him. <HI>This
<PB N="49" REF="046352_0048_10210A521F0B3848"/>is</HI> the word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching the glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ;
<MILESTONE N="37"/> He is Lord of all. Ye know the word which was published through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preach∣ed:
<MILESTONE N="38"/> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil;
<MILESTONE N="39"/> for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom yet they slew,
<MILESTONE N="40"/> having hanged <HI>him</HI> on a tree. Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
<MILESTONE N="41"/> (Not to all the people, but to witnesses, chosen before of God, <HI>even</HI> to us, who did eat and drink with him) after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us,
<MILESTONE N="42"/> to proclaim to the people, and to testify, that it is he who is ordained by
<PB N="50" REF="046352_0049_10210A59F3AA2A70"/>God the Judge of the living and the dead.
<MILESTONE N="43"/> To him give all the prophets witness, that every one who believeth in him, receiveth forgiveness of sins through his name.</P>
<P>While Peter was yet speaking these words,
<MILESTONE N="44"/> the Holy Ghost fell on all that were hearing the word. And the believers of the circumcision,
<MILESTONE N="45"/> as many as came with Peter, were amazed, that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Gentiles also.
<MILESTONE N="46"/> For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God.
<MILESTONE N="47"/> Then Peter answered, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, even as we?
<MILESTONE N="48"/> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they prayed him to tarry certain days.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="046352_0051_10210A5E80E05D80"/>when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that could withstand God?
<MILESTONE N="18"/> When they heard these things, they were quiet, and glorified God, saying, Then God hath given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life.</P>
<P>Now they who had been dispersed by the distress which arose about Stephen,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> travelled as far as Phe∣nicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews only.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who coming into Anti∣och, spake to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them;
<MILESTONE N="21"/> and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. And tidings of these things came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem,

<MILESTONE N="24"/> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Then went he to Tarsus to seek Saul, and having found him, he brought him to Antioch.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> And a whole year they assembled them∣selves with the church, and taught a considerable multitude: and the disciples were first called Chris∣tians at Antioch.</P>
<P>In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> <MILESTONE N="28"/> And one of them, named Agabus rising up, signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine through all the world; which also came to pass under Claudius Cesar.

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> About that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And he
<PB N="54" REF="046352_0053_10210A667B7AF590"/>slew James the Brother of John, with the sword. And perceiving it pleased the Jews,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> he proceeded to take Peter also: (Then were the days of unleaven∣ed bread.)
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Whom having apprehended, he put him in prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him forth to the people after the passover.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> So Peter was kept in the prison; but continual prayer was made to God by the church for him.</P>
<P>And when Herod was about to bring him forth,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldi∣ers, bound with two chains, and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And behold, an angel of the Lord stood over him, and light shined in the house: and smiting Peter on the side he waked him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And the angel said to him, Gird thyself and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he said to him, Throw thy garment about thee, and follow me.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And going out, he followed him. And he knew not that it was real which was done by the angel,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> but thought he saw a vision. When they had passed thro' the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: and going out, they went on through one street; and immediately the
<PB N="55" REF="046352_0054_10210A688131D4F8"/>angel departed from him.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and <HI>from</HI> all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And having considered, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together praying.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> named Rhoda. And knowing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but running in,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> told <HI>them,</HI> that Peter stood before the gate. And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed, it was so. Then they said, It is his angel. But Peter continued knocking.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And opening <HI>the door,</HI> they saw him,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> and were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand, to be silent, declared to them, How the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Shew these things to James and to the brethren. And going out he went to another place. Now when it was day,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> there was no small stir among the soldiers,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> What was become of Peter? And He∣rod having sought for him, and not found <HI>him,</HI> ex∣amined the keepers, and commanded <HI>them</HI> to be put
<PB N="56" REF="046352_0055_10210A6ACEF32DD0"/>to death.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And death. And going down from Judea to Cesarea, he abode <HI>there.</HI> And he was highly incensed against them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and having gained Blastus, the king's chamberlain, sued for peace; because their country was nourished by the king's <HI>country.</HI></P>
<P>And on a set day,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Herod arrayed in royal apparel, and sitting on his throne, made an oration to them. And the people shouted,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> <HI>It is</HI> the voice of a god, and not of a man.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not glory to God; And being eaten by worms,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> he expired. But the word of God grew and multiplied.</P>
<P>And Barnabas and Saul,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> having fulfilled their service, returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, surnamed Mark.</P>

<MILESTONE N="3"/> Then having fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent <HI>them</HI> away,

<MILESTONE N="6"/> Being aware <HI>of it,</HI> they fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia and the country round about,

<MILESTONE N="12"/> And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> which was before their city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, and with the multitude would have sacrificed.

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> But certain men coming down from Judea taught the brethren, Except ye be circumcised, after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had had no small contention and debate with them,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> they deter∣mined,
<PB N="67" REF="046352_0066_10210A8C16C0EBB0"/>that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them, should go up to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem about this question.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great Joy to all the brethren.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And being come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles and elders; and they declared all things which God had done with them.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> But there rose up, <HI>said they,</HI> certain of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed, saying. That we ought to circumcise them, and command them to keep the law of Moses.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And the apostles and elders came together, to consider of this matter.</P>
<P>And after much debate Peter rose up and said to them,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Brethren, ye know that God long ago made choice among us, that the Gentiles should by my mouth hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knoweth the heart,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> bare them wit∣ness, giving the Holy Ghost to them also, even as to us;
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And put no difference between us and them,
<PB N="68" REF="046352_0067_10210A8DE02055B0"/>purifying their hearts by faith.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
<MILESTONE N="11"/> But we believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we shall be saved even as they.</P>
<P>Then all the multitude kept silence,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and hearkened to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought by them among the Gentiles.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And when they held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Simon hath declared, how God at first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a peo∣ple for his name.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And to this agree the words of the prophets,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> as it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Amos</HI> ix. 11.@</NOTE> After this I will return and build again the fallen tabernacle of David; I will build again the ruins thereof, and will set it up,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> That the residue of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles on whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doth these things. Known unto God are all his works from eternity.<MILESTONE N="18"/> <PB N="69" REF="046352_0068_10210A906EFB5800"/>
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Wherefore I judge, That we trouble not them who from among the Gentiles turn to God.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But that we write to them, to abstain from things offered to idols, and fornication, and things strangled and blood.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> For Moses hath of old time them that preach him in every city, being read in the syna∣gogues every sabbath-day.</P>
<P>Then it seemed good to the apostles and elders with the whole church,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, Judas, furnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Writing thus by their hand, The apostles, and elders, and the brethren salute the brethren who are of the Gentiles, in Anti∣och,
<PB N="70" REF="046352_0069_10210A9375947DE0"/><MILESTONE N="24"/> and Syria, and Cilicia. Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who came from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, saying, <HI>Ye must</HI> be circumcised, and keep the law, whom we commanded not;
<MILESTONE N="25"/> It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send to you chosen men, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, Men that have hazarded their lives,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will also tell <HI>you</HI> the same things by mouth.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, that no further burden be laid upon you than these necessary things,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> To abstain from meats offered to Idols and blood, and things
<PB N="71" REF="046352_0070_10210A9847401828"/>strangled and fornication; from which keeping yourselves ye will do well. Fare ye well.</P>
<P>So being dismissed they came to Antioch,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> and having assembled the multitude, they delivered the the epistle:
<MILESTONE N="31"/> <HI>Which</HI> having read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> And Judas and Silas, being them∣selves also prophets, exhorted and confirmed the brethren with many words.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> And after they had tarried a space, they were dismissed with peace by the brethren to the apostles.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> But it seemed good to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilas to remain there.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> Paul also and Barnabas abode in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also the word of the Lord.</P>
<P>And after certain days Paul said to Barnabas,
<MILESTONE N="36"/> Let us go again and visit the brethren in every city, where we have preached the word of the Lord, <HI>and see</HI> how they do.
<MILESTONE N="37"/> And Barnabas counselled to take with them John,
<MILESTONE N="38"/> surnamed Mark. But Paul thought it not right to take with them him, who had de∣parted from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> And there was a sharp contention, so that they parted from each
<PB N="72" REF="046352_0071_10210A99F9C8D8C0"/>other; and Barnabas taking Mark with him, sailed away to Cyprus;
<MILESTONE N="40"/> but Paul having chosen Silas, departed, being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God.
<MILESTONE N="41"/> And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</P>

<MILESTONE N="20"/> they said, These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city,
<PB N="75" REF="046352_0074_10210AA0BAF9F238"/>And teach customs,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> which it is not lawful for us, being Romans,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> to receive, neither to observe. And the multitude rose up together against them; and the pretors tearing off their garments, commanded to beat <HI>them</HI> with rods.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast <HI>them</HI> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Who hav∣ing received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> and secured their feet in the stocks. But at midnight Paul and Silas having prayed, sung an hymn to God:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immedi∣ately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And the jailor awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing the prisoners were fled.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm; for we are all here. Then he called for lights,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> and sprang in, and tremb∣ling,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l down before Paul and Silas. And having
<PB N="76" REF="046352_0075_10210AA6EE73B940"/>brought them out he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
<MILESTONE N="31"/> And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy houshold.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> And they spake the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> And taking them that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> he and all his houshold. And having brought them up into his house, he set a table before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with his whole family.</P>
<P>And when it was day,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> the pretors sent the serjeant, saying,
<MILESTONE N="36"/> Let those men go. And the jailor told Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart,
<MILESTONE N="37"/> and go in peace. But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publickly, uncondemned, and have cast us into prison, who are Romans: and do they now thrust us out privately? Nay verily: but let them come themselves and conduct us out.
<MILESTONE N="38"/> And the serjeants reported these words to the pretors; and they were afraid when they heard that they were Ro∣mans.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> And they came and comforted them: and con∣ducting <HI>them</HI> out, requested that they would depart from the city.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> And coming out of the prison, they entered in∣to

<P>And having journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And Paul, according to his custom, went into them, and three sabbath-days discoursed with them from the scriptures;
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Open∣ing <HI>them</HI> and evincing, That Christ ought to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that this is the Christ, <HI>even</HI> Jesus, whom I declare unto you.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And some of them believed, and were joined to Paul and Silas, and a great number of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the principal women. But the Jews who believed not,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> filled with zeal, taking to them some of the mean and profligate fel∣lows, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making a mob, set all the city in an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, sought to bring
<MILESTONE N="1"/> <PB N="78" REF="046352_0077_10210AB3A81B5580"/>them out to the people.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying aloud, These men, that have turned the world upside down,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> are come hither also: Whom Jason hath privately received: and all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, that there is another king,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> <HI>one</HI> Jesus. And they alarmed the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> However having taken security of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.</P>
<P>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> who coming <HI>thither,</HI> went into the synagogue of the Jews.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> These were more ingenuous than those of Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, <HI>and</HI> daily searching the scriptures,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> whether those things were so? There∣fore many of them believed, and of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea also, they came thither likewise,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> and stirred up the multitude. Then the brethren sent away Paul immediately, to go as it were to the sea; but Silas and Timothy continued there.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and having received an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him with all speed, they departed.</P>
<P>Now,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him, see∣ing the city wholly given to idolatry.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> He there∣fore discoursed in the synagogue to the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market-place daily to those whom he met with.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Then some of the
<PB N="79" REF="046352_0078_10210AAC6EB18590"/>Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him: and some said, What would this babler say? Others, He seemeth to be a proclaimer of strange gods; because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine <HI>is,</HI> which is spoken by thee? For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears;
<MILESTONE N="20"/> we would therefore know, what these things mean? (For all the Athenians,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> and the strangers sojourning there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling or hearing some new thing.)</P>
<P>Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that ye are great∣ly
<PB N="80" REF="046352_0079_10210A54714F98A0"/>addicted to the worship of invisible powers.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> For as I passed along and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar, on which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: him therefore whom ye worship without knowing him, I proclaim unto you.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> God who made the world and all things therein, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwel∣leth not in temples made with hands:
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed any thing, he himself giving to all life, and breath, and all things.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> And he hath made of one blood the whole nation of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation:
<PB N="81" REF="046352_0080_10210AB6A3026700"/>That they might seek God,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain likewise of your own poets have said, For we are also his off∣spring.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think the God-head is like gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and contrivance of man. The times of ignorance,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> indeed, God overlooked; but he now commandeth all men every where to
<PB N="82" REF="046352_0081_10210AB949697068"/>repent.
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by the man whom he hath ordained, <HI>whereof</HI> he hath given as∣surance to all <HI>men,</HI> in that he hath raised him from the dead.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked: but others said, We will hear thee again concerning this.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> So Paul departed from among them.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> Howbeit, some clave to him and believed: among whom <HI>was</HI> even Di∣onysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Da∣maris, and others with them</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> After these things, Paul departing from Athens, came to Corinth.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And finding a certain Jew na∣med Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome) he went to them.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And as he was of the same trade, he abode with them and wrought, for they were
<PB N="83" REF="046352_0082_10210ABB859D1A70"/>tent-makers by trade.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and Greeks.</P>
<P>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But when they set themselves in opposition and blasphemed, he shook his raiment and said to them, Your blood <HI>is</HI> upon your own head; I am pure: from hence∣forth I will go to the Gentiles.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And going thence he went into the house of one named Justus, <HI>one</HI> that worshipped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And Crispus the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Then the Lord said to Paul by a vision, in the night, Fear not, but speak and hold not thy peace:
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much
<PB N="84" REF="046352_0083_10210ABD590964B0"/>people in this city.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</P>
<P>But when Gallio was proconful of Achaia,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> the Jews made an assault with one consent upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat, Saying, This <HI>fellow</HI> persuadeth men to worship God contra∣ry to the law.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> <MILESTONE N="14"/> And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice, or wicked licentiousness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye <HI>to it;</HI> for I will be no judge of these matters.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And he drove them away from the judg∣ment-seat.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Then they all took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.</P>
<P>And Paul still continued many days;
<MILESTONE N="18"/> and <HI>then</HI> taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria,
<PB N="85" REF="046352_0084_102107ABDFE490E8"/>and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shaved his head at Cenchrea;
<MILESTONE N="19"/> for he had a vow. And he came to Ephesus and left them there; but he him∣self going into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But though they intreated <HI>him</HI> to tarry long∣er with them,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> he consented not: But took his leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem, but I will return to you again,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> if God will. And he set sail from Ephesus. And landing at Cesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch. And having spent some time <HI>there,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="23"/> he departed and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.</P>
<P>Now a certain Jew,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Apollos by name, born at Alex∣andria, an eloquent man, mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> And he spake boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla
<PB N="86" REF="046352_0085_10210AC890333398"/>hearing him, took him to their house, and explained to him the way of God more perfectly.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And when he was desirous to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who being come thither, greatly helped through grace them that had believed.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> For he earnestly debated with the Jews in publick, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Now while Apolles was at Corinth, Paul hav∣ing passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost, since ye believed? And they said to him, Nay, we have not so much as heard, Whether there be any Holy Ghost.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> He said to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is, on Jesus. And hearing <HI>this,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="5"/> they were baptized in the name of
<PB N="87" REF="046352_0086_10210ACA48E505F8"/>the Lord Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And Paul laying <HI>his</HI> hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And they were in all about twelve men.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And going into the synagogue, he spake boldly, for three months discoursing and per∣suading the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when some were hardened and believed not,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> but spake reproachfully of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</P>
<P>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Paul,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them. And some of the vagabond Jews,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish chief priest,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> who did this. But the evil spirit answering said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
<PB N="88" REF="046352_0087_10210ACCFA86A2B0"/>know;
<MILESTONE N="16"/> but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them, and getting the mastery of them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And this was known to all both Jews and Greeks dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> And many of those who believed came, confessing and openly declaring their deeds.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Many also of those who had practised curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all men, and they computed the value of them,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> and found it fifty thousand <HI>pieces</HI> of silver. So powerfully did the word of God grow and prevail.</P>
<P>After these things were ended,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Paul purposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must see Rome also.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> And having sent two of those who ministred to him, Timotheus and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself staid in Asia for a season.
<PB N="89" REF="046352_0088_10210AD2CE9D4988"/>And about that time there arose no small tumult con∣cerning the way.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> <MILESTONE N="24"/> For a man named Demetrius, a silver-smith, who made silver shrines of Diana, pro∣cured no small gain to the artificers:
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Whom having gathered together, with the workmen employed in such things, he said, Sirs, ye know that our main∣tenance arises from this occupation.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> But ye see and hear, that not at Ephesus only, but almost through all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned aside much people; saying, that they are not gods, which are made with hands:
<MILESTONE N="27"/> So that there is danger not only that this our craft should come into disgrace, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And hearing <HI>this,</HI> they were filled with rage, and cried out, saying, Great <HI>is</HI> Diana of the Ephesians,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one ac∣cord into the theatre, dragging with them Caius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's fellow-travel∣lers.
<PB N="90" REF="046352_0089_10210BE17733C278"/><MILESTONE N="30"/> And when Paul would have gone in to the peo∣ple,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> the disciples would not suffer him. And some al∣so of the principal Officers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired, that he would not venture himself into the theatre.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was con∣fused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.

<MILESTONE N="34"/> one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about two hours, Great <HI>is</HI> Diana of the Ephesians.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> But the register, having pacified the people, said, Ye men of Ephesus what man is there who knoweth not, that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana, and of the <HI>image</HI> which fell down from Jupiter?
<MILESTONE N="36"/> Seeing then these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet,

<MILESTONE N="38"/> If then Demetrius and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are held, and there are proconsuls; let them implead one another.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determin∣ed in a lawful assembly.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> And indeed we are in dan∣ger to be questioned for sedition, concerning this day; there being no cause, whereby we can account for this concourse.

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> And after the tumult was ceased, Paul having called the disciples to him, and exhorted <HI>them,</HI> de∣parted to go into Macedonia.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And having gone through those parts, and exhorted them with much discourse,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> he came into Greece. And having abode <HI>there</HI> three months, an ambush being laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail into Syria, he de∣termined to return thro' Macedonia.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And there ac∣companied him to Asia Sopater of Berea, and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Caius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> These going before, staid for us at Troas. And we set sail for Philippi after the days of unleaven∣ed bread,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And on the first day of the week, when we were met together to break bread.
<PB N="92" REF="046352_0091_10210AD5D511A188"/>Paul being to depart on the morrow, preached to them,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> and continued his discourse till midnight. And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And a certain young man, named Eutychus, sitting in the window, fell into a deep sleep: and as Paul still continued his discourse, being overpowered with sleep, he fell down from the third story,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> and was taken up dead. And Paul went down and fell on him; and taking <HI>him</HI> in his arms, said,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Be not troubled; for his life is in him. And going up again, and having broken bread, he con∣versed long with them, even till break of day, and so departed.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> But we going be∣fore into the ship, sailed to Assos, where we were to take up Paul; for so he had appointed, Being him∣self to go on foot.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And when he met us at Assos, we took him up and came to Mitylene.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And sailing thence, we came the following day over-against Chios, and the next <HI>day</HI> we touched at Samos, and having tarried at Trogyllium, the day after came to Miletus. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he hasted, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="046352_0092_10210AD963229930"/>
<P>And sending to Ephesus from Miletus,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> he called thither the elders of the church.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> And when they were come to him, he said to them, Ye know in what manner I have conversed among you, all the time from the first day I came into Asia,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befel me through the ambushes of the Jews: <HI>And</HI> that I have with-held nothing which was profi∣table,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> but have preached to you, and taught you, publickly and from house to house:
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jerus Christ.</P>
<P>And now being bound by the Spirit,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> I go to Jerusa∣lem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the holy Ghost testifieth to me in every city,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> <PB N="94" REF="046352_0093_10210ADB330222D0"/>saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life precious to myself, so I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> to testify the gospel of the grace of God. And now I know that ye all among whom I have conver∣sed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Wherefore I take you to record this day,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> that I <HI>am</HI> pure from the blood of all <HI>men:</HI> For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the council of God.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the whole flock, in which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will en∣ter in among you,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> not sparing the flock. Yea, from among yourselves men will arise, speaking per∣verse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> remembering that for three years,
<PB N="95" REF="046352_0094_10210ADF1EA7EA68"/>I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.</P>
<P>And now,
<MILESTONE N="32"/> brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> I have coveted no man's silver, or gold,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> or apparel. Yea, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, that he him∣self said,
<MILESTONE N="36"/> It is happier to give than to receive. And having said these things, he kneeled down, and pray∣ed with them all.
<MILESTONE N="37"/> And they all wept sore, and fall∣ing on Paul's neck kissed him,
<MILESTONE N="38"/> Sorrowing most for that word which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> And when we were torn away from them, and had set sail, we ran with a strait course to Coos, and the next day to Rhodes,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> and thence to Patara. And finding a ship passing over to Phenicia, we went a∣board and set sail.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And coming within sight of Cy∣prus, and leaving <HI>it</HI> on the left-hand, we sailed to Sy∣ria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to un∣load her burden.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days, who told Paul by the Spirit, Not to go up to Jerusalem.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> But when we had finished these days, we departed and went our way; and they all at∣tended us out of the city, with their wives and chil∣dren: and kneeling down on the sea-shore we prayed. And having embraced each other we took ship,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> and they returned home.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And having finished <HI>our</HI> voy∣age, we came from Tyre to Ptolemais, and saluting the brethren,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> we abode with them one day. And the next day, we departed and came to Cesarea; and en∣tering into the house of Philip the Evangelist, who
<PB N="97" REF="046352_0096_10210AE6EE349D00"/>was <HI>one</HI> of the seven,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> we abode with him. And he had four daughters, virgins, who were prophetesses. And as we tarried many days,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> a certain prophet named Agabus,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> came down from Judea. And coming to us, he took up Paul's girdle, and binding his own feet and hands, said, Thus faith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver <HI>him</HI> into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard these things,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> both we, and they of the place, besought him, not to go up to Jerusalem. But Paul answered,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> What mean ye, weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</P>
<P>And after these days,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And <HI>some</HI> of the disciples also from Cesarea went with us, and brought us to
<PB N="98" REF="046352_0097_10210AE8ADBF4208"/>one Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</P>
<P>And when we were come up to Jerusalem,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> the brethren received us gladly.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> And the next day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. And having saluted them,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> he gave them a particular account of those things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And having heard <HI>it,</HI> they glorified God, and said to him, Thou seest, bro∣ther, how many thousands of believing Jews there are, and they are all zealous for the law.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, telling them, not to circumcise <HI>their</HI> chil∣dren,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> nor to walk after the customs. What is it there∣fore? The multitude must needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Therefore do this that we say to thee: there are with us four men, who
<PB N="99" REF="046352_0098_10210AF011C1CAA8"/>have a vow on them:
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Take them and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know, that there is nothing of those things which they have heard of thee; but <HI>that</HI> thou thyself walkest orderly, keeping the law.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and determined, that they should observe no such thing; save only that they keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> and from fornication. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till the offering should be offered for every one of them.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And when the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia seeing him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude, and laid hands on him, Crying out,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Men of Israel, help! This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: yea and hath even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this
<PB N="100" REF="046352_0099_10210AF29223D838"/>holy place.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> And the whole city was moved, and the people ran together; and laying hold on Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.</P>
<P>And as they went about to kill him,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> word came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> Who immediately took soldiers and cen∣turions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded <HI>him</HI> to be bound with two chains, and enquired, Who he was, and what he had done! But some among the multitude cried out one thing,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> some another; and when he could not know the cer∣tainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> But when he came upon the stairs,
<PB N="101" REF="046352_0100_10210AF611BF6560"/>he was borne of the soldiers, through the violence of the multitude.
<MILESTONE N="36"/> For the throng of people followed after crying,
<MILESTONE N="37"/> Away with him. And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he said to the tribune, May I speak to thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
<MILESTONE N="38"/> Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out four thousand murtherers into the wilderness?
<MILESTONE N="39"/> But Paul said, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee give me leave to speak to the people.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> And when he had given leave, Paul standing on the stairs, waved <HI>his</HI> hand to the people: and a great silence being made, he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, Brethren, and fathers, hear ye now my defence unto you.</P>

<PB N="102" REF="046352_0101_10210AFAF633F618"/>this day.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and wo∣men:
<MILESTONE N="5"/> As likewise the high priest is my witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damas∣cus; to bring them who were there bound to Jerusa∣lem to be punished.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But as I journeyed and drew near to Damascus, about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> why persecutest thou me? And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> whom thou persecutest. And they that were with me saw the light, and were terrified; but they did not hear the voice of him that spake to me. And I said,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise, and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed thee to do.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And as I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand by them that were with me, I came into Damascus. And one Ananias,
<PB N="103" REF="046352_0102_10210AFCA02074F0"/>a devout man according to the law,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt <HI>there,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Coming to me, stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And he said, the God of our fathers hath chosen thee, to know his will, and see that Just one, and hear the voice of his mouth.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> For thou shalt be his witness to all men,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> of what thou hast seen and heard. And now, why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance; And saw him saying to me,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Make haste and depart quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not re∣ceive thy testimony concerning me.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> I also was standing by, and consenting, and kept the garments of them that slew him.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> But he
<PB N="104" REF="046352_0103_10210AFEEFDDD860"/>said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far off to the Gentiles.</P>
<P>And they heard him to this word,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> and <HI>then</HI> lifted up their voice and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live. And as they cried out,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> and rent their garments, and cast dust into the air,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they cried so against him.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman even uncondemned?
<MILESTONE N="26"/> The cen∣turion hearing <HI>it,</HI> went and told the tribune, say∣ing, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Then the Tribune came and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And the tribune answered, I purchased this freedom with a great sum of money. And Paul said,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> But I was <HI>free</HI>-born. Then they who were going to examine him, immediately departed
<PB N="105" REF="046352_0104_10210B0472FD6FB0"/>from him: and the tribune was afraid, after he knew he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</P>
<P>And on the morrow,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> desiring to know the cer∣tainty, what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from <HI>his</HI> bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come; and bring∣ing Paul down, set him before them.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> And Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God till this day.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And Ananias the high priest commanded them that stood by, to smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul to him,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> God is about to smite thee, thou whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me accordingly to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
<MILESTONE N="4"/> But they that stood by,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> said, Revilest thou God's high priest? Then said Paul, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest; for it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxii. 28.@</NOTE> Thou shalt not
<PB N="106" REF="046352_0105_10210B06221BBC38"/>revile the ruler of thy people.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But Paul perceiving that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question. And when he had said this,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> there arose a contention between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> For the Sadducees say, there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And there was a great clamour: and the Scribes of the Pharisees side arising, contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> let us not fight against God. And as a great disturbance arose, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and pluck him from among them, and bring him into the castle.</P>
<P>And the night following,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> the Lord standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem,
<PB N="107" REF="046352_0106_10210B07B1BA25F8"/>so thou must testify at Rome also.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And when it was day, some of the Jews entering into a conspi∣racy, bound themselves by a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink, till they had killed Paul.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And they were more than forty, who had made this confederacy.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves by a solemn curse, not to taste any thing, till we have killed Paul.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would more accurately know the things concern∣ing him: and we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> But Paul's sister's son, hearing of <HI>their</HI> lying in wait, came, and entering into the cas∣tle,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> told Paul. And Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said, Conduct this young man to the tribune;
<MILESTONE N="18"/> for he hath something to tell him. So he took and brought him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner, calling me to him, desired me, to bring this young man to thee, who hath some∣thing to tell thee.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And the tribune taking him by the hand, and going aside privately, asked, What is it that thou hast to tell me?
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would enquire something concerning him more accurately.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> But do not yield to them; for there are more than forty
<PB N="108" REF="046352_0107_10210B0A477E9C10"/>of them lie in wait, who have bound themselves with a curse, neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, expecting a promise from thee.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> So the tribune dismissed the young man, having charged <HI>him.</HI> Tell no man, that thou hast discovered these things to me.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And having called to him two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And provide beasts, to set Paul upon, and conduct <HI>him</HI> safe to Felix the governor.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> And he wrote a letter after this man∣ner, Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Gover∣nor Felix,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> greeting. As this man was seized by the Jews,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> and about to be killed by them, I came with the soldiery and rescued him, having learned, that he was a Roman.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before their council:
<MILESTONE N="29"/> Whom I found to be accu∣sed concerning questions of their law, but to be charged with nothing worthy of death or of bonds. And when it was shewn me,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> that an ambush was about to be laid for the man by the Jews, I imme∣diately sent <HI>him</HI> to thee, commanding his accusers also to say before thee what they have against him. Farewel.</P>
<P>The soldiers therefore taking Paul,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> as it was commanded them, brought <HI>him</HI> by night to Anti∣patris.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> On the morrow they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:
<MILESTONE N="33"/> Who en∣tering into Cesarea, and delivering the letter to the governor,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> presented Paul also before him, And having read <HI>it,</HI> he asked of what province he was?
<PB N="109" REF="046352_0108_10210B10DCF06E98"/>And being informed that he was of Cilicia,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> And after five days, Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, <HI>named</HI> Tertullus; who appeared before the governor against Paul.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And he being called, Tertullus began to accuse <HI>him,</HI> saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by thy prudence always, and in all places,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> We accept <HI>it,</HI> most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> But that I may not trouble thee far∣ther, I beseech thee of thy clemency to hear us a few words.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring leader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Who hath also attempted to pro∣fane the temple; whom we seized and would have judged according to our law.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Commanding his accusers to come to thee, whereby thou mayst thyself, on examination, take knowledge of all these things, of which we ac∣cuse him.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</P>
<P>Then Paul,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> after the governor had made a sign to him to speak, answered, Knowing thou hast been for
<PB N="110" REF="046352_0109_10210B1269FAEED8"/>several years a judge to this nation, I chearfully an∣swer for myself:
<MILESTONE N="11"/> As thou mayst know, that it is but twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem. And they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> nor making an insurrection among the multitude, either in the synagogues, or in the city.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Nor can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets;
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Having hope in God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust, which they themselves also expect.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And for this cause do I also
<PB N="111" REF="046352_0110_10210B14E0B638C8"/>exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Now after se∣veral years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purifying in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult:
<MILESTONE N="19"/> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought to have been present before thee, and to accuse <HI>me,</HI> if they had any thing against me.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Or let these themselves say, what crime they found in me, when I stood before the council, Unless <HI>it be</HI> concerning this one word,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> that I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ch. xxiii. 6.@</NOTE> I am called in question by you this day.</P>
<P>And when Felix heard these things,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately in∣formed concerning this way, when Lysias the tribune cometh down, I will take full cognisance of your af∣fair.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And he commanded the centurion to keep him, and let <HI>him</HI> have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from ministring to him.</P>
<P>And after some days,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Felix coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> And as he rea∣soned concerning justice, temperance, and the judg∣ment
<PB N="112" REF="046352_0111_10210B18716B3308"/>to come, Felix being terrified, answered, Go thy way for this time: when I have a convenient sea∣son,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> I will afterwards call for thee. And he hoped also that money would have been given him by Paul; therefore he sent for him the oftener, and discoursed with him.

<P>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem. Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> ap∣peared before him against Paul, and besought him, Begging favour against him,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> that he would send for
<PB N="113" REF="046352_0112_10210B1A25BD8F60"/>him to Jerusalem, lying in wait to kill him by the way.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> But Festus answered, That Paul was kept at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart <HI>thither</HI> shortly.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Therefore let those of you, said he, who are able, go down with me and accuse the man, if there be any <HI>wickedness</HI> in him.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Cesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment-seat, he commanded Paul to be brought. And when he was come,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem, stood round about <HI>him,</HI> bring∣ing many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove:
<MILESTONE N="8"/> While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I offended at all.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> But Festus, desiring to gratify the Jews, an∣swered Paul, and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Then said Paul, I am standing at Ce∣sar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou also very well knowest.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> For if indeed I have done wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death. I refuse not to die: but if there is nothing of the things whereof they accuse me, no man can give me up to
<PB N="114" REF="046352_0113_10210B1CD43E1930"/>them.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou ap∣pealed to Cesar? To Cesar shalt thou go.</P>
<P>And after certain days,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> king Agrippa and Ber∣nice came to Cesarea,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> to salute Festus. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared the case of Paul to the king, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews appeared before <HI>me,</HI> desiring judgment against him.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans, to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have liberty to make his defence, touch∣ing the crime laid to his charge.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay sat on the judgment-seat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed;
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But had certain questions against him, relating to their own religious worship, and about one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul af∣firmed
<PB N="115" REF="046352_0114_10210B1E6EE82DC0"/>to be alive.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And as I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked, If he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters?
<MILESTONE N="21"/> But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</P>
<P>And on the morrow,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp, and were entered into the place of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Fes∣tus,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Paul was brought forth. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all ye who are present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusa∣lem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live any longer.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had himself appealed to the Emperor, I determined to send him:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Of whom I have nothing certain to write to <HI>my</HI> lord: wherefore I have brought him before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination taken, I may have somewhat to write.

<MILESTONE N="13"/> At mid∣day, O king, I saw in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round me and them that journeyed with me.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <HI>It is</HI> hard for thee to kick against the goads.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> But rise and stand upon thy feet; for
<PB N="118" REF="046352_0117_10210B26873D7C30"/>I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to ordain thee a minister and a witness, both of the things which thou hast seen, and of those in which I will appear to thee,

<MILESTONE N="18"/> to whom I now send thee, To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive through faith which is in me, forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> From that time, 'O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the hea∣venly vision,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But first to them at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and <HI>then</HI> to the Centiles I declared, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.

<MILESTONE N="24"/> And as he was thus m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k∣ing his desence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad.

<MILESTONE N="26"/> For the king knoweth of these things; to whom also I speak with freedom; for I am persuad∣ed none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> King Agrippa, Be∣lievest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said unto Paul,

<P>And as he said this,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> the king rose up, and the go∣vernor; and Bernice, and they that sat with them. And as they were going away,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> they speak one to another, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death,

<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>And when it was determined, to sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and certain other prisoners, to a centurion named Julius, of the Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an cohort. And going aboard a ship of Adramyttium,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> that was to sail by the coasts of Asia, we set fail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. And the next day we reached Sidon.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted <HI>him</HI> to go to <HI>his</HI> friends, to take refreshment.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And setting sail from thence, we failed under Cyprus, because the winds were con∣trary.
<PB N="121" REF="046352_0120_10210B30AA158F40"/><MILESTONE N="5"/> And having sailed through the sea of Cilicia, and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <HI>a city</HI> of Lycia. And the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria there,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> bound for Italy,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> put us on board of it. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were scarce come over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> over against Salmone. And passing it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called the Fair Havens, near which was the city La∣séa.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And as much time was spent, and sail∣ing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Paul exhorted <HI>them,</HI> Saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with injury and much damage, not only to the lading and the ship, but also to our lives.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> But the centurion regarded the mas∣ter and the owner of the vessel, more than the things which were spoken by Paul.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And as the haven was not convenient to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence also, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter <HI>there, which is</HI> an haven of Crete looking to the south-west and north-west.</P>
<P>And as the south-wind blew gently,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed an∣chor,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> and sailed on close by Crete. But not long af∣ter there arose against it a tempestuous wind named
<MILESTONE N="1"/> <PB N="122" REF="046352_0121_10210B3244A894C8"/>Euroclydon.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And the ship being caught, and not able to bear up against the wind, we let <HI>her</HI> drive. And running under a certain island called Clauda,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> we were hardly able to get masters of the boat: Which having taken up,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> they used helps, under∣girding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quick-sands, they struck fail, and so were driven.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> And as we were in an exceeding great storm, the next day they lightened the ship. And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> <MILESTONE N="20"/> And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on <HI>us,</HI> all hope of our being saved was now taken away.</P>
<P>But after long abstinence,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Paul standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and <HI>so</HI> have avoided this injury and loss.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Yet now I exhort you to be of good courage; for there shall be no loss of <HI>any</HI> life among you,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> but of the ship <HI>only.</HI> For there stood by me this night an angel of the God, whose I am,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be presented before Cesar: and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
<PB N="123" REF="046352_0122_10210B34AB28FEF8"/>Wherefore,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Sirs, take courage: for I trust in God, that it shall be even as it hath been spoken to me. But we must be cast on a certain island.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> And when the fourteenth night was come,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about mid∣night the sailors suspected, that they drew nigh some land.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And sounding, they found twenty fa∣thoms; and having gone a little farther, sounding again,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> they found fifteen fathoms. And fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. But when the sailors were attempting to flee out of the ship,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to carry out anchors out of the foreship,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Paul said to the cen∣turion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship,
<MILESTONE N="32"/> ye cannot be saved. Then the soldiers cut
<PB N="124" REF="046352_0123_10210B3951E84250"/>off the ropes of the boat,
<MILESTONE N="33"/> and let it fall off. And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> Therefore I exhort you to take food: for this is for your preservation; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. And having spoken thus,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all; and having bro∣ken <HI>it,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="36"/> he began to eat. Then were they all en∣couraged,
<MILESTONE N="37"/> and they also took meat. And we were in the ship in all, two hundred and seventy∣six souls.
<MILESTONE N="38"/> And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a shore, into which they were minded, if possible,
<MILESTONE N="40"/> to thrust the ship: And having taken up the anchors, they committed <HI>it</HI> to the sea, at the same time loosing the rudder-bands, and hoist∣ing up the stay-sail to the wind, they made for the shore.
<MILESTONE N="41"/> But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a-ground; and the fore∣part sticking fast, remained immoveable, but the
<PB N="125" REF="046352_0124_10210B3BC9516FE0"/>hinder part was broken by the force of the waves. And the counsel of the soldiers was to kill the pri∣soners,
<MILESTONE N="42"/> lest any one should swim away and escape. But the centurion,
<MILESTONE N="43"/> being desirous to save Paul, hindred them from their purpose, and command∣ed those that could swim, throwing themselves <HI>into the sea,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="44"/> first to get away to land. And the rest, some on boards, and some on <HI>broken pieces</HI> of the ship; and so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> And being escaped, we then knew, that the island was called Mélita.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And the Barbarians shewed us uncommon kindness; for having kind∣led a fire, they brought us all to <HI>it,</HI> because of the present rain,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> and because of the cold. Now as Paul was gathering a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming from the heat, fastened upon his hand.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And when the Barbarians saw the venomous animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, Doubtless this man is a
<PB N="126" REF="046352_0125_10210B3E5AF78C98"/>murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, vengeance hath not suffered to live.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> But having shaken off the venomous animal into the fire, he suf∣fered no harm.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> However they expected, that he would have swollen, or suddenly fallen down dead: but after having waited a considerable time, seeing no mischief befal him, they changed their minds, and said, he was a god.</P>
<P>And near that place was the estate of the chief man of the island,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> named Publius, who receiving us into his house, entertained us courteously three days.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Now the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and bloody flux; to whom Paul went in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him and heal∣ed him.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And when this was done, the rest also in the island, who had disorders, came and were healed,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Who likewise honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary.</P>
<P>And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> which had wintered in the island, whose
<PB N="127" REF="046352_0126_10210B407180C678"/>sign was Castor and Pollux.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And arriving at Syra∣cuse,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> we tarried <HI>there</HI> three days, Whence coast∣ing round, we came to Rhegium, and the south wind rising after one day, we came the next to Putéoli:
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Where finding brethren, we were intreat∣ed to tarry with them seven days, and so we went toward Rome.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And the brethren having heard of us, came out thence to meet us, <HI>some</HI> as far as Appii Forum, and <HI>others</HI> to the Three Taverns, whom, when Paul saw he thanked God and took courage.</P>
<P>And when we were come to Rome,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with the soldier that kept him.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And after three days, he called the chief of the Jews together. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet have I been deliver∣ed a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Who having examined me, were will∣ing to have released <HI>me,</HI> because there was no cause of death in me,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But when the Jews opposed <HI>it,</HI> I was constrained to appeal to Cesar; not that I had
<PB N="128" REF="046352_0127_10210B43875388B8"/>any thing to accuse my nation of.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> For this cause therefore have I intreated to see and speak with you; for <HI>it is</HI> on account of the hope of Israel, <HI>that</HI> I am bound with this chain.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea con∣cerning thee, nor hath any of the brethren coming hither,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> related or spoken any evil of thee. But we defire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for con∣cerning this sect, we know, that it is every where spoken against.</P>
<P>And having appointed him a day,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded, testify∣ing the kingdom of God, and persuading them con∣cerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> from morning till evening. And some believed the things that were spoken, and some be∣lieved not.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> And not agreeing with each other, they brake up the assembly, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Saying,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> vi. 9, &amp;c. <HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 14. <HI>John</HI> xii. 40.@</NOTE> Go to this people and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not under∣stand,
<PB N="129" REF="046352_0128_10210B4673141C60"/>and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For the heart of this people is waxed gross,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <HI>their</HI> eyes, and hear with <HI>their</HI> ears, and understand with <HI>their</HI> hearts, and should be converted and I should heal them.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debating with each other.</P>
<P>And he continued two whole years in his own hired house,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> and received all that came to him, Preaching the kingdom of God,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> and teaching the things that relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, no man forbidding him.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES ON ST. PAUL's Epistle to the ROMANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>MANY of the Writings of the New Testament are written in the Form of Epistles. Such are not only those of St. <HI>Paul, James, Peter, Jude,</HI> but also both the Treatises of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and all the Writings of St. <HI>John.</HI> Nay, we have seven Epistles herein, which the LORD <HI>Jesus</HI> Himself sent by the Hand of <HI>John</HI> to the seven Churches: Yea, the whole <HI>Revelation</HI> is no other than an Epistle from Him.</P>
<P>Concerning the Epistles of St <HI>Paul,</HI> we may observe he writes in a very different Manner, to those Churches which he had planted himself, and to those <HI>who had not seen</HI> his <HI>face in the flesh.</HI> In his Letters to the former, a loving or sharp Familiarity appears, as their Behaviour was more or less suitable to the Gospel, To the latter, he proposes the pure, unmixt Gospel, in a more general and abstract Manner.</P>
<P>As to the Time wherein he wrote his Epistles, it is probable he wrote, about the Year of <HI>Christ</HI> according to the common Reckoning:

<P>As to the General Epistles, it seems St. <HI>James</HI> wrote a little be∣fore his Death, which was A. D. 63 St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who was martyr'd in the Year 67, wrote his latter Epistle a little before his Death, and

<P>To express the Design and Contents of this Epistle, a little more at large. The Apostle labours throughout, to fix in those to whom he writes, a deep Sense of the Excellency of the Gospel, and to engage them to act suitably to it. For this Purpose, after a general Salutation, (ch.i. 1-7.) and Profession of his Affection for them (ver. 8. 15.) he declares he shall not be ashamed openly to maintain the Gospel at <HI>Rome,</HI> seeing it is the powerful Instrument of Salvation, both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by Means of Faith. (ver 16, 17.) And in order to demonstrate this, he shews,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the World greatly needed such a Dispensation, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being in a most abandoned State; (ver. 18-32.) and the <HI>Jews,</HI> though condemning others, being themselves no better: (ch. ii. 1-29.) As, notwithstanding some Cavils, which he obviates, (ch. iii. 1-8.) their own Scriptures testify. (9-19.) So that all were under a Necessity of seeking Justification by this Method. (20-31.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David</HI> themselves sought Justification, by Faith, and not by Works, (ch. iv. 1-25.)</P>
<P N="3">3. That all who believe are brought into so happy a State, as turns the greatest Afflictions into Matter of Joy. (ch. v. 1-11.)</P>
<P N="4">4. That the evils brought on Mankind by <HI>Adam,</HI> are abundantly recompensed to all that believe in <HI>Christ.</HI> (12-21.)</P>
<P N="5">5. That far from dissolving the Obligations to practical Holi∣ness, the Gospel increases them by peculiar Obligations, (ch. vi. 1-23.)</P>
<P>In order to convince them of these Things the more deeply, and to remove their Fondness for the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law, now they were <HI>married to Christ</HI> by Faith in him, (ch vii. 1-6.) he shews how un∣able the Motives of the Law were to produce that Holiness, which Believers obtain, by a living Faith in the Gospel; (ch. v.i. 7-25. viii. 1, 2.) and then gives a more particular View of those Things, which rendered the Gospel effectual to this great End. (ver 3-39.)</P>
<P>That even the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> if they believed, should have a Share in these Blessings; and that the <HI>Jews,</HI> if they believed not, should be excluded from them, being a Point of great Importance, the Apostle bestows the 9th, 10th, and 11th Chapters in settling it. He begins the 9th Chapter by expressing his tender Love and high Esteem for the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, (ver. 1-5.) and then shews,</P>
<P N="1">1. That GOD's rejecting great Part of the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> yea, and of <HI>Isaac</HI> too, was undeniable Fact (6-13.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That GOD had not chosen them to such peculiar Privileges, for any Kind of Goodness either in them or their Fathers (14-24.)</P>
<P N="3">3. That his accepting the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and rejecting many of the <HI>Jews,</HI> had been foretold both by <HI>Hosea</HI> and <HI>Isaiah.</HI> (ver. 25-33.)</P>
<P N="4">4. That GOD had offered Salvation to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> on the same Terms, though the <HI>Jews</HI> had rejected it. (ch. x. 1.-21.)</P>
<P N="5">5. That though the Rejection of <HI>Israel</HI> for their Obstinacy was General, yet it was not Total: there being still a Remnant among them who did embrace the Gospel. (ch. xi. 1-10.)</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Rejection of the rest was not Final, but in the End <HI>all Israel should be saved.</HI> (ver. 11-31.)</P>
<P N="7">7. That mean time even their Obstinacy and Rejection served to display the unsearchable Wisdom and Love of GOD. (ver. 32-36.)</P>
<PB N="133" REF="046352_0132_10210B50CDF5FD68"/>
<P>The Rest of the Epistle contains practical Instructions and Exhor∣tations He particularly urges, 1. An entire Consecration of them∣selves to GOD, and a Care to glorify Him by a faithful Improvement of their several Talents: (ch. xii 1-11.) 2. Devotion, Patience, Hospitality, mutual Sympathy, Humility, Peace, and Meekness; (ver. 12-21.) 3. Obedience to Magistrates, Justice in all its Bran∣ches, Love the fulfilling of the Law, and universal Holiness: (ch. xiii. 1-14.) 4. Mutual Candor between those who differed in Judg∣ment, touching the Observance of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law; (ch. xiv. 1-23. xv. 1-17.) in enforcing which he is led to mention the Extent of his own Labours, and his Purpose of visiting the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the mean Time recommending himself to their Prayers, (ver. 18-33.) And after many Salutations, (ch. xvi. 1-16) and a Caution against those who caused Divisions, he concludes with a suitable Blessing and Doxology. (v. 17-27.)</P>

<MILESTONE N="3"/> Concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was of the seed of David,
<PB N="134" REF="046352_0133_10210B52D0650968"/>according to the flesh;
<MILESTONE N="4"/> <HI>But</HI> declared the Son of God with Power, according to the spirit of holi∣ness,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> by the resurrection from the dead; By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedi∣ence to the faith in all nations for his name, Among whom are ye also,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> the called of Jesus Christ:
<MILESTONE N="7"/> To all that are in Rome, <HI>who are</HI> beloved of God, called <HI>and</HI> holy, Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>First,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> I thank my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, that your faith is spoken of through
<PB N="135" REF="046352_0134_10210B54B18206C8"/>the whole world.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how incessantly I make mention of you,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Always requesting in my prayers to come unto you, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that ye may be established,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> That is, to be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you
<PB N="136" REF="046352_0135_10210B59A9AE1AE0"/>and me.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you, (though I have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> I am a debtor both to the Greeks and the Barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Therefore, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are at Rome.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> For I am not ashamed of the gos∣pel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, both to the Jew and to the Gentile.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For the righteousness of God is
<PB N="137" REF="046352_0136_10210B5CBA843598"/>revealed therein from faith to faith; as it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hab.</HI> ii. 4.@</NOTE> The just shall live by faith.</P>
<P>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who detain the truth in unrighteousness.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For what
<PB N="138" REF="046352_0137_10210B5EDD673CA8"/>is to be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <HI>it</HI> to them.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> For those things of him which are invisible, both his eternal power and God head, are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by the Things which are made,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> so that they are without excuse: Because knowing God, they did not glorify <HI>him</HI> as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> they became fools, And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image in the likeness of corruptible man,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> and of birds, and of four-footed creatures and reptiles. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the desires of their hearts,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> to dishonour their bodies among themselves;
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Who changed
<PB N="139" REF="046352_0138_10210B61C42BD730"/>the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature above the creator, who is blessed for ever!
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Amen. Therefore God gave them up to vile affections; for even their women changed the natural use to that which is against nature:
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And likewise also men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward each other, men with men working fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thiness, and receiving in themselves the just recompence of their error. And as they did not like to retain God in <HI>their</HI> knowledge,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> God gave them up to an undiscerning mind, to do the things which were not expedient, Fisled with all injustice,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> fornication, maliciousness, covetousness, wickedness: full of envy, murder, contention,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> deceit, malignity: Whisperers, backbiters: haters of God, violent, proud: boast∣ers, invente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of evil things: disobedient to parents, Without understanding,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> covenant-breakers, with∣out natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.
<PB N="140" REF="046352_0139_10210B63932D9390"/>Who knowing the righteous judgment of God,
<MILESTONE N="32"/> that they who practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that practise them.</P>

<P> <MILESTONE N="1"/> What then <HI>is</HI> the advantage of the Jew, or what the profit of the circumcision?
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Much every way; chiefly in that they were entrusted with the oracles of God. For what if some believed not?
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God?
<MILESTONE N="4"/> God forbid: let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written,

<MILESTONE N="5"/> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <HI>Is</HI> not God unjust, who taketh vengeance?
<MILESTONE N="6"/> I speak as a man. God forbid; other∣wise how should God judge the world?
<MILESTONE N="7"/> But if the truth of God hath abunded to his glory through my lie,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> why am I still judged as a sinner? And why may we not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to
<PB N="146" REF="046352_0145_10210B75B753F0C0"/>say) do evil, that good may come? Whose condem∣nation is just.</P>
<P>What then?
<MILESTONE N="9"/> are we better <HI>than they?</HI> In no wise: for we have before proved all, both Jews and Gen∣tiles,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> to be under sin. As it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xiv. 1, &amp;c.@</NOTE> There is none righteous,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> no not one. There is none that un∣derstandeth; there is none that seeketh after God. They have all turned aside,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> they are together be∣come unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> v. 9.@</NOTE> Their throat <HI>is</HI> an open sepulchie; with their tongues they have used deceit; the

<MILESTONE N="17"/> <NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xxxvi. 1.@</NOTE> The fear of God is not before their eyes.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Now we know that whatsoever the law saith,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> it saith
<PB N="147" REF="046352_0146_10210B7C9BFF9E28"/>to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty be∣fore God.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Therefore no flesh shall be justified in his sight by the works of the law; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</P>
<P>But now the righteousness of God is manifested without the law,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> being attested by the law and the prophets,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Even the righteousness of God, by the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all that believe: for there is no difference:
<MILESTONE N="23"/> For all have finned, and are fallen short of the glory of God,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is
<PB N="148" REF="046352_0147_10210B7ED9A9E2A0"/>in Christ Jesus:
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Whom God hath set forth a pro∣pitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demon∣stration of his righteousness by the remission of past sins,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> through the forbearance of God: For a de∣monstration, <HI>I say,</HI> of his righteousness in this pre∣sent time, that he might be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</P>
<P>Where <HI>is</HI> boasting then?
<MILESTONE N="27"/> It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. We conclude then,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> <HI>Is</HI> God <HI>the God</HI> of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles? Surely of the
<PB N="149" REF="046352_0148_10210B80DD055DF8"/>Gentiles also:
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Seeing <HI>it is</HI> one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through <HI>the same</HI> faith.

<PB N="151" REF="046352_0150_10210B873B579AC8"/>was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> How was it then imputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And he received the sign of circum∣cision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which <HI>he had</HI> in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all who believe in uncircumcision, that righteous∣ness may be imputed to them also,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And the father of the circumcision, to them who not only are of the circumcision, but also walk in the footsteps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumci∣sion.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <HI>was</HI> not to Abraham or to his seed by the law,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> but by the righteousness of faith. For if they who are of the law <HI>are</HI> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise of no effect.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Because the law work∣eth wrath: for where no law is, <HI>there is</HI> no transgression.
<PB N="152" REF="046352_0151_10210B8C0A007C60"/>Therefore <HI>it is</HI> of faith,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> that <HI>it might be</HI> of grace, that the promise might be firm to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> who is the father of us all, (As it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 5.@</NOTE> I have appointed thee a father of many nations) before God in whom he believed, as quickning the dead, and calling the things that are not, as though they were:

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> xv. 5.@</NOTE> So shall thy seed be.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, being about an hundred years old,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> nor the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, And being fully assured,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed unto him,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But on ours also, to whom it will be im∣puted,
<PB N="153" REF="046352_0152_10210B90174F6840"/>if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have had access through faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And not only <HI>so,</HI> but we glory in tribu∣lations also, knowing that tribulation worketh pati∣ence,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And patience experience, and experience hope; And hope shameth us not,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost which
<PB N="154" REF="046352_0153_10210B91EDF365B0"/>which is given unto us.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> For when we were yet with∣out strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly. Now one will scarce die for a just man;
<MILESTONE N="7"/> yet perhaps for the good man one would even dare to die.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But God recommendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Christ died for us. Much more then being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For if, being ene∣mies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved through his life.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And not only <HI>so,</HI> but we also glory
<PB N="155" REF="046352_0154_10210B9637B379C8"/>in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</P>
<P>Therefore as by one man sin entered into the world,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and death by sin, even so death passed upon all men,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> in that all sinned. For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed, where there is no law.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the
<PB N="156" REF="046352_0155_10210B98B33417E0"/>figure of him that was to come.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Yet not as the offence, so also <HI>is</HI> the free gift. For if by the offence of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, that of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And not as <HI>the loss</HI> by one that sinned, <HI>so is</HI> the gift; for the sentence <HI>was</HI> by one <HI>offence</HI> to condemnation; but the free gift <HI>is</HI> of many offences unto justification.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For if through one man's offence death reigned by one, they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteous∣ness, shall much more reign in life, by one, <HI>even</HI> Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> As therefore by one offence <HI>the sentence of death came</HI> upon all men to condemnation, so also by one righteousness, <HI>the free gift came</HI> upon all men to justification of life.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For as by the disobedience of one man, many were constituted sinners, so by the obedience of one, many shall be constituted righteous.
<PB N="157" REF="046352_0156_10210B9DA0DDECD8"/>But the law came in between,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> that the offence might abound: yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
<MILESTONE N="21"/> That as sin had reigned through death, so grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>

And as Death through the Sin of the First <HI>Adam,</HI> reigned <HI>even over them who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression:</HI> So <PB N="156" REF="046352_0155_10210B98B33417E0"/> through the Righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> even those who have not obeyed, after the Likeness of his Obedience, shall reign in Life. We may add, As the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> without the Sins which we af∣terwards committed brought us Death: So the Righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> without the good Works which we afterwards perform, brings us Life: Although still every good, as well as evil Work, will receive its due Reward.</P>

<MILESTONE N="6"/> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <HI>him,</HI> that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer serve sin.

<MILESTONE N="10"/> For in that he died, he died to sin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> So reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man,

<MILESTONE N="3"/> Therefore if she marry ano∣ther man while her husband liveth, she will be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so as to be no adulteress, though she marry another man.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Therefore ye also, my brethren,

<P>What shall we say then?
<MILESTONE N="7"/> That the law is sin? God forbid. Yea, I should not have known sin, but for the law. I had not known lust, unless the law had said,

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Therefore <HI>there is</HI> now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath freed me from the law of sin and death.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> <MILESTONE N="3"/> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God <HI>hath done:</HI> sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, <HI>to be a sacrifice</HI> for sin, he hath condemned sin in the flesh:
<MILESTONE N="4"/> That the righteous∣ness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit. <MILESTONE N="5"/> They that are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
<PB N="165" REF="046352_0164_10210BBEB5EE9848"/>Now to be carnally minded <HI>is</HI> death;
<MILESTONE N="6"/> but to be spiritually minded <HI>is</HI> life and peace:
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Because to be carnally minded <HI>is</HI> enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwell in you.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And if any man have not the Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Now if Christ <HI>be</HI> in you, the body indeed <HI>is</HI> dead because of sin, but the Spirit <HI>is</HI> life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> he that raised up Christ from the dead, will also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</P>
<P>Therefore,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the
<PB N="166" REF="046352_0165_10210BC0F7B67380"/>flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if we suffer with <HI>him,</HI> that we may also be glorified with <HI>him.</HI> For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time <HI>are</HI> not worthy <HI>to be compared</HI> with the glory which
<MILESTONE N="18"/> <PB N="167" REF="046352_0166_10210BC3DB8695C8"/>shall be revealed in us.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> but by him who subjected <HI>it,</HI> In hope that the creation itself shall be delivered from the bon∣dage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> For we know that the whole creation groaneth together and travaileth together until now.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And not only <HI>they,</HI> but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen
<PB N="168" REF="046352_0167_10210BC89AD7B440"/>is not hope: for what a man seeth, how doth he yet hope for?
<MILESTONE N="25"/> But if we hope for what we see not, we paticutly wait for it.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh inter∣cession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. But he who searcheth the hearts,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> knoweth what <HI>is</HI> the mind of the Spirit: for he maketh intercession for the saints according to God.</P>
<P>And we know,<MILESTONE N="28"/> that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them that are
<PB N="169" REF="046352_0168_10210BCD98930400"/>called according to <HI>his</HI> purpose.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> For whom he fore∣knew, he also predestinated, conformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> And whom he predesti∣nated, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them
<PB N="170" REF="046352_0169_10210BD0415556D0"/>he also glorified.
<MILESTONE N="31"/> What shall we say then to these things? If God <HI>be</HI> for us, who <HI>can be</HI> against us?
<MILESTONE N="32"/> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
<MILESTONE N="33"/> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? <HI>It is</HI> God that justifieth, Who <HI>is</HI> he that condemneth?
<PB N="171" REF="046352_0170_10210BD2C9B13F38"/><HI>It is</HI> Christ that died,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right-hand of God, who likewise maketh intercession for us.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
<MILESTONE N="36"/> (As it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxiv. 22.@</NOTE> For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)
<MILESTONE N="37"/> Nay, in all these things we more than conquer, through him who hath loved us.
<MILESTONE N="38"/> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
<PB N="172" REF="046352_0171_10210BDA41086398"/>nor things present,
<MILESTONE N="39"/> nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</P>

<P>To explain this (nearly in the Words of an eminent Writer) a lit∣tle more at large. When a Man has a Work of Time and Impor∣tance before him, he pauses, consult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and contrives; and when he has laid a Plan, resolves or <HI>decrees</HI> to proceed accordingly. Having observed this in ourselves, we are ready to apply it to GOD also: and he in Condescension to us has applied it to Himself.</P>
<P>The Works of Providence and Redemption are vast and stupen∣dous, and therefore we are apt to conceive of GOD, as deliberating and consulting on them, and then <HI>decreeing</HI> to act, according to <HI>the Counsels of his own Will.</HI> As if, long before the World was made, he had been concerting Measures, both as to the making and go∣verning of it, and had then writ down his Decrees, which altered not, <PB N="169" REF="046352_0168_10210BCD98930400"/> any more than the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians.</HI> Whereas to take this <HI>consulting</HI> and <HI>decreeing</HI> in a literal Sense would be the same Absurdity, as to ascribe a real, human Body and human Pas∣sions to the ever blessed GOD.</P>
<P>This is only a popular Representation of his infallible Know∣ledge and unchangeable Wisdom; that is, He does all Things as wisely as a Man can possibly do, after the deepest Consultation, and as steadily pursues the most proper Method, as one can do, who has said a Scheme before-hand. But then, though the Effects be such as would argue Consultation and consequent Decrees in Man, yet what Need of a Moment's Consultation in Him, who sees all Things at one View?</P>
<P>Nor had GOD any more Occasion to pause and deliberate, and lay down Rules for his own Conduct, from all Eternity, than He has now. What!

<P>If we survey the Right which GOD has over us, in a more general Way, with regard to his intelligent Creatures, GOD may been considered in two different Views, as Creator, Proprietor, and Lord of all, or as their moral Governor and Judge.</P>
<P>GOD, as sovereign Lord and Proprietor of all dispenses his Gifts or Favours to his Creatures with perfect Wisdom, but by no Rules or Methods of pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeding that we are acquainted with.

<P>Therefore though <HI>He hath mercy on whom he willeth, and whom he willeth he hardeneth</HI> (that is, suffers to be hardened in consequence of their obstinate Wickedness) yet his is not the Will of an arbi∣trary, capricious, or tyrannical Being.

<MILESTONE N="3"/> Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth;
<MILESTONE N="4"/> for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be up∣held;

<MILESTONE N="6"/> He that regardeth the day, regardeth <HI>it</HI> to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard <HI>it.</HI> He that eateth, eateth to the Lord; for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. But if we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether therefore we live or die,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died and lived,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living. But why dost thou judge thy brother?
<MILESTONE N="10"/> or why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.

<MILESTONE N="13"/> Let us therefore no longer judge one another; but judge this rather, not to lay a stumbling block,

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> PAUL, called <HI>to be</HI> an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> To the church of God, which is in Co∣rinth, to them who are sanctified through Christ Jesus, called <HI>and</HI> holy, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Grace <HI>be</HI> unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/> I thank my God always on your behalf,
for the grace of God which is given you by Christ Je∣sus:
<MILESTONE N="5"/> That in every thing ye are enriched through him, in all utterance and <HI>in</HI> all know∣ledge,
<PB N="206" REF="046352_0205_10210C4EA7F27C78"/>
<MILESTONE N="6"/> As the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you:
<MILESTONE N="7"/> So that ye are wanting in no good gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will also confirm you to the end,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> <HI>that ye may be</HI> blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. God <HI>is</HI> faithful,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>
<P>Now I exhort you,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <HI>that</HI> there be no schisms among you, but <HI>that</HI> ye be perfectly joined together, in the same mind and in the same judgment.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> For it hath been declared to me of you, my brethren, by them <HI>of the family</HI> of Chloe, that there are conten∣tions among you.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Now this I say, every one of you faith, I am of Paul, and I of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>llos, and I
<PB N="207" REF="046352_0206_10210C5345D5A318"/>Of Cephas,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
<MILESTONE N="14"/> I thank God, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius: Lest any should say,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> that I had baptized in my own name.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> I baptized also the house of Stepha∣nas. I know not that I baptized any other.</P>
<P>For Christ did not send me to baptize,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> but to preach the gospel; <HI>but</HI> not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none ef∣fect.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> For the doctrine of the cross is indeed to them that perish, foolishness; but to us who are sa∣ved,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> it is the power of God. For it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> xxix. 14.@</NOTE> I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and abo∣lish
<PB N="208" REF="046352_0207_10210C5544B5D368"/>the understanding of the prudent.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> xxxiii. 18.@</NOTE> Where <HI>is</HI> the wise? Where <HI>is</HI> the scribe? Where <HI>is</HI> the dis∣puter of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
<MILESTONE N="21"/> For since, in the wis∣dom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> For whereas the Jews de∣mand signs,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> and the Greeks seek wisdom, We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> and to the Greeks foolishness: But to them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
<PB N="209" REF="046352_0208_10210C57C88774D8"/>Behold your calling,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> brethren: that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble <HI>are called:</HI>
<MILESTONE N="27"/> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world, hath God chosen to shame the things that are mighty:
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And the base things of the world, and things that are despised, hath God chosen; yea, things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are;
<MILESTONE N="29"/> That no flesh may glory before God.

<MILESTONE N="3"/> for while <HI>there is</HI> among you emulation, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and walk according to man? For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I <HI>am</HI> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</P>
<P>Who then is Paul,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> and who <HI>is</HI> Apollos, bat ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
<MILESTONE N="6"/> I planted, Apollos watered;
<PB N="213" REF="046352_0212_10210C66B8DE26B8"/>but God gave the increase.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and every one shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For we are fellow-labourers of God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. According to the grace of God given to me,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> as a wise master-builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon; but let every one take heed how he buildeth thereon.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> For other foun∣dation can no man lay, than what is laid, which
<PB N="214" REF="046352_0213_10210C69EB7D0E80"/>is Jesus Christ:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And if any one build on this foundation, gold, silver, costly stones; wood, hay,

<MILESTONE N="14"/> of what sort it is. If any one's work which he hath built thereon, shall remain, he shall receive a reward.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> If any one's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but himself shall be saved, yet so as through the fire.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
<MILESTONE N="17"/> If any man destroy the temple of God, him

<MILESTONE N="18"/> Let none deceive himself: if any one among you thinketh himself to be wise, let him become a fool in this world, that he may become wise.

<MILESTONE N="15"/> For if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <HI>have ye</HI> not many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Je∣sus through the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> I beseech you therefore, be ye followers of me.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For this cause I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. Now some are puffed up,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> as if I would not come to you.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord permit, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> but the power. For the kingdom of God <HI>is</HI> not in speech,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> but in power. What will ye? That I come to you with a rod? Or in love, and the spirit of meekness?</P>

<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote to me, <HI>It is</HI> good for a man, not to touch a wo∣man.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Yet, <HI>to avoid</HI> fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Let the husband render the debt to the wife; and in like manner the wife to the husband.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband; and in like man∣ner the husband also hath not power over
<PB N="224" REF="046352_0223_10210C888CF1EF30"/>his own body,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> out the wife. Withdraw not from each other, unless <HI>it be</HI> by consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer, and may come together again, lest Satan tempt you through your incontinence.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But I say this by permission, not by way of precept.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For I would that all men were even as myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, another after that.</P>
<P>But to the unmarried and the widows I say,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> It is good for them,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> if they remain even as I. But if they have not power over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</P>
<P>The married I command,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> <HI>yet</HI> not I, but the Lord,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> v. 32.@</NOTE> That the wife depart not from her husband. But if she depart,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And let not the husband put away his wife. To the rest speak I, not the Lord. If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not
<PB N="225" REF="046352_0224_10210C8B642DD358"/>put her away.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And the wife, who hath an unbe∣lieving husband, that consenteth to live with her, let her not put him away.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified by the wife; and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified by the hus∣band. Else were your children unclean; but now they are holy.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not ins;laved in such <HI>cases;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="16"/> but God hath called us to peace. For how knowest thou, O wife, but thou mayst save thy husband? Or knowest thou, O husband, but thou mayst save thy wife?
<MILESTONE N="17"/> But as God hath dis∣tributed to every one, as the Lord hath called e∣very one, so let him walk. And thus I ordain in all the churches.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Is any one called being cir∣cumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any one called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Circumcision is nothing, and uncir∣cumcision is nothing, but keeping the command∣ments of God.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Let every one in the calling wherein he is called,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> therein abide. Wast thou
<PB N="226" REF="046352_0225_10210C8E196DAC90"/>called; <HI>being</HI> a bond-man? care not for it: but if thou canst be made free,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> use <HI>it</HI> rather. For he that is called by the Lord, <HI>being</HI> a bond-man, is the Lord's freeman; and in the like manner, he that is called <HI>being</HI> free,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> is the bondman of Christ. Ye are bought with a price; do not become the bond-slaves of men.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Brethren, let every one wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</P>
<P>Now concerning virgins,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> I have no command∣ment from the Lord: but I give my judgment as one who hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> I apprehend therefore, that this is good for the present distress, that <HI>it is</HI> good for a man to continue as he is.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed: art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Yet if thou dost marry thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in
<PB N="227" REF="046352_0226_10210C95B73EC2E0"/>the flesh;
<MILESTONE N="29"/> but I spare you. But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that even they that have wives,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> be as if they had none? and they that weep, as if they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> as if they possessed not; and they that use this world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world passeth away:
<MILESTONE N="32"/> Now I would have you without carefulness. The unmarried man careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> But the married man careth for the things of the world,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> how he may please his wife. There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spi∣rit: but the married careth for the things of the
<PB N="228" REF="046352_0227_10210C97F03B0FA8"/>world,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> how she may please her husband. And this I say for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but that ye may decently wait up∣on the Lord and without distraction.
<MILESTONE N="36"/> But if any think that he acteth indecently toward his virgin, if she be above age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart,
<MILESTONE N="37"/> having no necessity, but having power over his own will, and hath determined this in his heart, to keep his virgin,
<MILESTONE N="38"/> doth well. So then he also that giveth in marriage, doth well; but he that giveth not in marriage, doth better.</P>
<P>The wife is bound as long as her husband liv∣eth;
<MILESTONE N="39"/> but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry whom she will;
<MILESTONE N="40"/> only in the Lord. But she is happier, if she continue as she is, in my judgment; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</P>

<P> <MILESTONE N="1"/> Now as to things sacrificed to idols, we know: for all of us have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> but love edifieth. And if any one think he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> But if any one love God, he is known by him.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> I say, as to the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol <HI>is</HI> nothing in the world, and that <HI>there is</HI> no God but one. For though there be that are called gods,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are many gods and many lords) Yet to us <HI>there is but</HI> one God,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> the Father from whom <HI>are</HI> all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom <HI>are</HI> all things, and we by him.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> But <HI>there is</HI> not in all men this knowledge; for some do even until now, with con∣sciousness of the idol, eat <HI>it</HI> as sacrificed to the idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</P>

<MILESTONE N="9"/> But take heed, lest by any means this your liberty become a stumbling-block to the weak. For if any one-see thee,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> who hast knowledge, sitting at meat in an idol-temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be encouraged to eat of the things sacrificed to the idol?
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died. But when ye sin thus against your brethren,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</P>

<PB N="231" REF="046352_0230_10210CA380420270"/>My answer to them who examine me is this.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Have we not power to eat and to drink?
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Have we not power to lead about a sister,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> a wife, as well as the other apostles, and brethren of the Lord, and Peter?
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Or I only and Barnabas, have we not pow∣er to forbear working?
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Who ever serveth as a sol∣dier at his own charge? Who planteth a vineyard, and doth not eat its fruit? Or who feedeth a flock, and doth not eat of the milk of the flock?
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Do I speak these things as a man? Doth not the law also speak the same?
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For it is written, in the law of Moses,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> xxv. 4.@</NOTE> Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Doth God take care for oxen? Or speaketh he altogether for our sakes? for our sakes it was written: for he who ploweth, ought to plow in hope; and he that thrasheth in hope, <HI>ought</HI> to be a partaker of his hope.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> If we have sown unto you spi∣ritual things, <HI>is it</HI> a great matter, if we shall reap
<PB N="232" REF="046352_0231_10210CA7581EAAD8"/>your carnal things?
<MILESTONE N="12"/> If others partake of this power over you, <HI>do</HI> not we rather? Yet we have not used this power: but we suffer all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Know ye not that they who are employed about holy things, are fed out of the temple? And they who wait at the altar,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> are partakers with the altar. So also hath the Lord
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> x. 10.@</NOTE> ordained, that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> But I have used none of these things; nor have I written thus, that it might be done so unto me: for <HI>it were</HI> better for me to die, than that any man would make <HI>this</HI> my glorying void. For if I preach the gospel,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> I have nothing to glory of; for a necessity lieth upon me, and wo to me, if I preach not the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> If indeed I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, <HI>yet</HI> a dispensa∣tion is intrusted to me.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> What then <HI>is</HI> my reward? that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gos∣pel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For though I am free from all men, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might
<PB N="233" REF="046352_0232_10210CA9092BA030"/>gain the Jews: to them that are under the law, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law:
<MILESTONE N="21"/> To them that are without the law, as with∣out the law, (being not without the law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without the law.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that by all means I might save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> that I may be partaker thereof with <HI>you.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Know ye not, that they who run in the race, all run: but one receiveth the prize?
<MILESTONE N="25"/> So run that ye may obtain. And every one that contendeth, is temperate in all things: and they indeed, to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> I therefore so run, not as un∣certainly;

<MILESTONE N="11"/> Now all these things happened to them for examples, and they are written for our admoni∣tion,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> on whom the ends of the ages are come. There∣fore let him that most assuredly standeth, take heed, lest he fall.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man; and God <HI>is</HI> faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above your ability, but will with the temptation make also a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear <HI>it.</HI> Wherefore,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to wise men;
<MILESTONE N="15"/> judge ye what I say. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
<MILESTONE N="16"/> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For we, being many, are one bread, and one body; for
<PB N="237" REF="046352_0236_10210CB6D96D8D50"/>we are all partakers of the one bread.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Consider Israel after the flesh. Are not they who eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?
<MILESTONE N="19"/> What say I then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is any thing? Or that an idol is any thing?
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But that what the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. Now I would not that ye should be partakers with devils. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> and the table of devils. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
<MILESTONE N="23"/> are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me; but all things are not ex∣pedient; all things are lawful for me; but all things edify not.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Let no one seek his own, but every one another's welfare.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Whatever is sold in the shambles eat,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> asking no questions for conscience sake.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xxiv. 1.@</NOTE> For the earth <HI>is</HI> the Lord's,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> and the fulness thereof. And if any of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are dis∣posed to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience sake.

<MILESTONE N="30"/> why am I blamed for that for which I give thanks?
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Therefore whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> Give no offence either to the Jews, or to the Gentiles,
<MILESTONE N="33"/> or to the church of God: Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but that of many, that they may be sa∣ved.</P>

<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<P>Be ye followers of me, as I also <HI>am</HI> of Christ.</P>
<P>Now I praise you,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the orders, as I delivered <HI>them</HI> to you.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman <HI>is</HI> the man, and the head of Christ <HI>is</HI> God. Every man praying or prophesying with <HI>his</HI> head co∣vered,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> <PB N="239" REF="046352_0238_10210CC11EBD85A8"/>dishonoureth his head.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> But every woman praying or prophesying with <HI>her</HI> head uncovered, dis∣honoureth her head; for it is the same as if she were shaved.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Therefore if a woman is not covered, let her also be shaved: but if it be shameful, for a wo∣man to have her hair shaved off, or cut short, let her be covered.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> A man indeed ought not to have <HI>his</HI> head covered, being the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Neither was the man created for the sake of the woman, but the woman for the sake of the man.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For this cause <HI>also</HI> the woman ought to have a veil upon <HI>her</HI> head,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> because of the angels: Ne∣vertheless neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
<PB N="240" REF="046352_0239_10210CC2AA6E78F8"/>And as the woman <HI>was</HI> of the man,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> so also the man <HI>is</HI> by the woman; but all things <HI>are</HI> of God. Judge of yourselves:
<MILESTONE N="13"/> is it decent for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Doth not nature itself teach you, that for a man to have long hair, is a disgrace to him?
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Whereas for a woman to have long hair, is a glory to her; for her hair was given her instead of a veil.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> But if any one be re∣solved to be contentions, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</P>
<P>But in this which I declare,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> I praise <HI>you</HI> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> For first, when ye come together in the church, I hear there are schisms among you,
<PB N="241" REF="046352_0240_10210CC51B26C670"/>(and I partly believe it.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For there must be here∣sies also among you, that the approved among you may be manifest.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> ) Therefore when ye come toge∣ther into one place, it is not eating the Lord's supper.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> For in eating every one taketh before <HI>an∣other</HI> his own supper, and one is hungry, another drinks largely.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> What! have ye not houses to eat and drink in? or do ye despise the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <HI>you</HI> not.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
<PB N="242" REF="046352_0241_10210CC6D5CF8EA0"/>And when he had given thanks,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> he brake <HI>it,</HI> and said, This is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> In like manner also <HI>he took</HI> the cup after he had supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this as often as ye drink <HI>it,</HI> in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> and drink this cup, ye shew forth the Lord's death, till he come. So that whosoever eateth the bread and drinketh the cup of the Lord unworthily,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judg∣ment to himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> For this cause many <HI>are</HI> sick and weak among you,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> and many sleep. For if we would
<PB N="243" REF="046352_0242_10210CCC2DED8D98"/>judge ourselves,
<MILESTONE N="32"/> we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat,
<MILESTONE N="34"/> wait one for another. And if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</P>

And it is in the same Sense that the Word is used. ch. 1.10. and ch. xii. 25. which are the only Places in the New Testament beside this, where <HI>Church-Schisms</HI> are mentioned. Therefore the indulging any Temper contrary to <PB N="241" REF="046352_0240_10210CC51B26C670"/> this tender <HI>Care</HI> of each other, is the true scriptural <HI>Schism.</HI> This is therefore a quite different Thing from that orderly Separation from corrupt Churches, which later Ages have stigmatized as <HI>Schism;</HI> and have made a Pretence for the vilest Cruelties, Op∣pressions, and Murders, that have troubled the Christian World. Both <HI>Heresies</HI> and <HI>Schisms</HI> are here mentioned in very near the same Sense; unless by <HI>Schisms</HI> be meant rather those inward Animosities which occasion <HI>Heresies;</HI> that is, outward Divisions or Parties. So that whilst one said, I am of <HI>Paul,</HI> another, I am of <HI>Apollos,</HI> this implied both <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Heresy.</HI> So wonderfully have later Ages distorted the Word <HI>Heresy and Schism</HI> from their scriptural Mean∣ing. <HI>Heresy</HI> is not, in all the Bible, taken for "an Error in Fun∣damentals," or in any thing else; nor <HI>Schism,</HI> for any Separation from the outward Communion of others. Therefore, both <HI>Heresy</HI> and <HI>Schism,</HI> in the modern Sense of the Words, are Sins that the Scripture knows nothing of; but were invented merely to deprive Mankind of the Benefit of private Judgment, and Liberty of Con∣science.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Now concerning spiritual <HI>gifts,</HI> brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Ye know that when ye were heathens, ye were carried away after dumb idols, as ye were led.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Therefore I give you to know, that <HI>as</HI> no one speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed; so no one can say, Jesus <HI>is</HI> the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Now there are diversities of gifts,
<PB N="244" REF="046352_0243_10210CCFCB495FB0"/>but the same Spirit.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And there are diversities of ministrations,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> but the same Lord: And there are di∣versities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.</P>
<P>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> to profit withal.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another by the same Spirit, the word of Knowledge;
<MILESTONE N="9"/> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit;
<MILESTONE N="10"/> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another <HI>divers</HI> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> But one and the same Spirit worketh all these, dividing to every one severally as he willeth.</P>
<PB N="245" REF="046352_0244_10210CD2174DF528"/>
<P>For as the Body is one,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and yet hath many mem∣bers, but all the members of the body, many as they are,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> are one body, so <HI>is</HI> Christ. For we are all bap∣tized by one Spirit into one body, whether <HI>we are</HI> Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or freemen; and we have all drank of one Spirit.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For the body is not one member,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> but many. If the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it there∣fore not of the body?
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And if the ear should say, Be∣cause I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
<MILESTONE N="17"/> If the whole body <HI>were</HI> an eye, where <HI>were</HI> the hearing? If the whole <HI>were</HI> hear∣ing,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> where <HI>were</HI> the smelling? But now hath God set the members, every one in the body, as it hath pleased him.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And if all were one member, where <HI>were</HI> the body?
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Whereas now there <HI>are</HI> indeed many members,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> yet but one body. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; or again, the head to the feet,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> I have no need of you. Yea, the<PB N="246" REF="046352_0245_10210CD3D4DF46E8"/>members of the body, which appear to be weaker, are much more necessary.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And those which we think to be the less honourable <HI>parts</HI> of the body, these we surround with more abundant honour, and our un∣comely <HI>parts</HI> have more abundant comeliness.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> For our comely <HI>parts</HI> have no need; but God hath tem∣pered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that which lacked:
<MILESTONE N="25"/> That there might be no schism in the body, but <HI>that</HI> the members might have the same care for each other:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> And whether one member suffer, all the members might suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the mem∣bers might rejoice with it.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part.</P>
<P>And God hath set in the church,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> first, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers: afterward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, <HI>different</HI> kinds of tongues.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> <HI>Are</HI> all Apostles? <HI>Are</HI> all prophets? <HI>Are</HI> all teachers? <HI>Have</HI> all miraculous powers?
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues?
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Do all interpret? Ye covet earnestly the best gifts. But I shew unto you a more excel∣lent way.</P>

<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Follow after love: and desire spiritual <HI>gifts;</HI> but especially that ye may prophesy.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For he that speaketh in an <HI>unknown</HI> tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God; for no one understandeth <HI>him,</HI> though by the
<PB N="250" REF="046352_0249_10210CE3B5910340"/>Spirit he speaketh mysteries:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Whereas he that pro∣phesieth, speaketh to men to edification, and exhor∣tation,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and comfort. He that speaketh in an <HI>un∣known</HI> tongue, edifieth himself; but he that prophe∣sieth,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> edifieth the church. I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for he that prophesieth, <HI>is</HI> greater than he that speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret, that the church may re∣ceive edification.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you, either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesy,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> or by doctrine? So inanimate things which give a sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the bat∣tle?
<MILESTONE N="9"/> So likewise unless ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken?
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For ye will speak to the air. Let there be ever so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them without signification;
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Yet if I know not the meaning of the language, I shall be a barba∣rian to him that speaketh, and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> So ye also, seeing ye desire spiritual gifts, seek to abound <HI>in them,</HI> to the edifying of the church.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Therefore let him that speaketh in an <HI>unknown</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="046352_0250_10210CE8B75B6EB8"/>tongue,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> pray that he may interpret. For if I pray in an <HI>unknown</HI> tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my un∣derstanding is unfruitful.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> What then is <HI>my duty?</HI> I will pray with the Spirit; but I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the Spirit; but I will sing with the understanding also.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Otherwise if thou givest thanks with the Spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of a private person, say Amen to thy thanksgiving, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For thou verily givest thanks well; yet the other is not edified.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> I thank God, that I speak with tongues more than you all.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Yet in the congregation I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an <HI>unknown</HI> tongue.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Brethren, be not children in understanding: in wickedness be ye as infants, but in understanding be ye grown men.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> It is written in the law,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> xxviii. 11.@</NOTE> in foreign tongues and with foreign lips will I speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me,
<PB N="252" REF="046352_0251_10210CEBCC6E9A18"/>saith the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; whereas prophecy <HI>is</HI> not for unbelievers,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> but for believers. Yet if the whole church be met together, and all speak with <HI>un∣known</HI> tongues, and there come in ignorant persons, or unbelievers, will they not say, that ye are mad? Whereas if all prophesy,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> and there come in an unbe∣liever, or an ignorant person, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all:
<MILESTONE N="25"/> The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on <HI>his</HI> face, he will worship God, and declare that God is among you of a truth.</P>
<P>What a thing is it,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> brethren, that when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doc∣trine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an in∣terpretation?
<PB N="253" REF="046352_0252_10210CEEB2C6CF50"/>
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Let all things be done to edification. If any one speak in an <HI>unknown</HI> tongue, <HI>let it be</HI> by two or three at most, and that by course, let one interpret. But if there be no interpreter,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> let him be silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God. Let two or three of the prophets speak,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> and let the rest judge.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> rest judge. But if <HI>any thing</HI> be revealed to another that sitteth by,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> let the first be silent. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be comforted.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> For the spirits of the prophets, are subject to the prophets.
<MILESTONE N="33"/> For God is not <HI>the author</HI> of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
<MILESTONE N="34"/> Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be in subjection,
<MILESTONE N="35"/> as
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 16.@</NOTE> the law also saith. And if they
<PB N="254" REF="046352_0253_10210CF1C2148050"/>desire to learn any thing, let them ask their own hus∣bands at home: for it is indecent for a woman to speak in the assembly.
<MILESTONE N="36"/> Did the word of God come out from you?
<MILESTONE N="37"/> or did it come to you alone? If any one think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge that the things which I write to you, are the commandments of the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="38"/> But if any one is ignorant, let him be ig∣norant.
<MILESTONE N="39"/> Therefore, brethren, covet to prophesy; yet forbid not to speak with tongues.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> Let all things be done decently and in order.</P>

<MILESTONE N="7"/> then by all the apostles.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Last of all he was seen by me also, as an untimely birth.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God that <HI>was</HI> with me.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Whether therefore I or they,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> so we preach, and so ye believed. But if Christ is preached, that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?

<MILESTONE N="15"/> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified from God, that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> if the dead rise not. For if the dead rise
<PB N="256" REF="046352_0255_10210CF834994D30"/>not,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Concerning the collection for the saints, as I have ordered the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> On the first <HI>day</HI> of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store according as he hath been prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And when I am come, whomsoever ye, shall approve, them will I send with letters, to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And if it be proper,
<PB N="263" REF="046352_0262_10210D1179945B40"/>that I also should go, they shall go with me. Now I will come to you,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> when I have passed through Macedonia, (for I pass through Macedo∣nia.)
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And perhaps I may stay, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me forward on my journey,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> whithersoever I go. For I will not see you now in my way; but hope to stay some time with you,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> if the Lord permit. But I will stay at Ephe∣sus till Pentecost.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For a great and effectual door is opened to me, and there <HI>are</HI> many adversaries.</P>
<P>But if Timotheus come,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> even as I. Therefore let no man despise him, but conduct ye him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I look for him with the brethren.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> As to <HI>our</HI> brother Apollos, I besought him much, to come to you with the brethren; yet he was by no means willing to come now; but he will come when it shall be convenient.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, acquit yourselves like men;
<MILESTONE N="14"/> be strong. Let all your affairs be done in love.</P>
<P>And I beseech you,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> brethren, <HI>as</HI> ye know the houshold of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to
<PB N="264" REF="046352_0263_10210D14F3EB07E8"/>serve the faints,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> That ye also submit to such, and to every one that worketh with <HI>us</HI> and laboureth. I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> and Fortu∣natus, and Achaicus: for they have supplied what was wanting on your part.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> For they have refresh∣ed my spirit and yours; such therefore acknow∣ledge.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> The churches of Asia salute you. A∣quila and Priscilla, with the church that is in their house,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> salute you much in the Lord. All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss.</P>
<P>The salutation of <HI>me</HI> Paul with my own hand.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> If any man love not the Lord Jesus,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> let him be anathema:
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Maran-atha. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>be</HI> with you.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> My Love <HI>be</HI> with you all in Christ Jesus.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus <HI>our</HI> brother, To the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Grace and Peace <HI>be</HI> to you from God our Father, and <HI>from</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Blessed <HI>be</HI> the God and Father of our Lord Je∣sus Christ,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the comfort wherewith we our∣selves are comforted of God.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our comfort also abound∣eth through Christ.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And whether we are afflicted, <HI>it is</HI> for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, <HI>it is</HI> for your comfort, which is effectual in the patient enouring the same sufferings
<PB N="267" REF="046352_0266_10210D2079B08A18"/>which we also suffer.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And our hope concerning you is steadfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> so also of the comfort. For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the trouble which befel us in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sia, that we were ex∣ceedingly pressed, above <HI>our</HI> strength, so that we despaired even of life.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Yea, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> but in God, who raiseth the dead: Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deli∣ver: in whom we trust, that he will still deliver: You likewise helping together with us by prayer for us,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> that for the gift <HI>bestowed</HI> upon us, by means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on your behalf.</P>
<P>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is our rejoicing,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> the testimony of our co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carnal wisdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For we write no other
<PB N="268" REF="046352_0267_10210D22A888A1F8"/>things to you, but what ye know and acknowledge, and I trust will acknowledge even to the end.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, as ye also <HI>are</HI> ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that ye might have had a second benefit.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come to you again from Mace∣donia, and to be brought forward by you in my way toward Judea.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Now when I was thus minded did I use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that there should be with me yea and nay?
<MILESTONE N="18"/> <HI>As</HI> God is faithful, our word to you hath not been yea and nay.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For Je∣sus Christ, the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Ti∣motheus, was not yea and nay; but was yea in him.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> For all the promises of God <HI>are</HI> yea in him, and amen in him,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> to the glory of God by us. For he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and that

<MILESTONE N="22"/> Who hath also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</P>
<P>But I call God for a record on my soul,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> that to spare you,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> I came not as yet to Corinth. Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye have stood.</P>

<MILESTONE N="2"/> For if I grieve you, who is he that cheereth me,

<MILESTONE N="4"/> For from much afflic∣tion and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many

<MILESTONE N="7"/> So that on the contrary <HI>ye should</HI> rather forgive and comfort <HI>him,</HI> lest such an one should be swallowed up with over-much sorrow.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> I beseech you therefore to confirm <HI>your</HI> love toward him. For to this end also did I write,

<MILESTONE N="10"/> To whom ye forgive any thing, I <HI>forgive</HI> also; and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven any thing, <HI>it is</HI> for your sakes, in the per∣son of Christ:

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> For we know that if our earthly house of <HI>this</HI> tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon, with our house which is from heaven:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> If being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> For we who are in <HI>this</HI> tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we would be un∣clothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing <HI>is</HI> God, who hath also given us
<PB N="278" REF="046352_0277_10210D3BC46A5F00"/>the earnest of the Spirit.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Therefore <HI>we</HI> always behave undauntedly; knowing that while we are sojourning in the body, we are absent from the Lord: (for we walk by saith, not by sight.)
<MILESTONE N="7"/> We behave undauntedly,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> <HI>I say,</HI> and are willing rather to be ab∣sent from the body, and present with the Lord.</P>
<P>Therefore we are ambitious,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> whether present, or absent,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> to be well-pleasing to him. For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in the body,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> whether good or evil. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: but we are made manifest to God, and I trust we are made manifest in your consciences also.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> We do not again recommend ourselves to you; but we give you an oc∣casion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have something to <HI>answer</HI> them, who glory in appearance,<PB N="279" REF="046352_0278_10210D3E0F23F618"/>and not in heart.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For if we are transported beyond ourselves, <HI>it is</HI> to God; if we are sober, <HI>it is</HI> for your sakes.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For the love of Christ constraineth us, while we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And <HI>that</HI> he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> and rose again. So that we from this time know no one after the flesh; yea, if we have known even Christ after the flesh, yet now we know <HI>him so</HI> no more.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Therefore if any one <HI>be</HI> in Christ, <HI>there is</HI> a new creation: the old things are passed
<PB N="280" REF="046352_0279_10210D40AF95A018"/>away;
<MILESTONE N="18"/> behold all things are become new: And all things <HI>are</HI> from God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation:
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Namely, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and hath commit∣ted to us the world of reconciliation.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Therefore we are embassadors for Christ, as though God were in∣treating by us: we beseech <HI>you,</HI> in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> For he hath made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us, that we might be
<PB N="281" REF="046352_0280_10210D4616D85F98"/>made the righteousness of God through him.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Having therefore, beloved, these pro∣mises, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</P>
<PB N="284" REF="046352_0283_10210D5190647110"/>
<P>Receive us.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> We have hurt no man, we have corrupted no man,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> we have defrauded no man. I speak not, to condemn <HI>you;</HI> for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts, to live and to die with <HI>you.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Great <HI>is</HI> my freedom of speech toward you; great <HI>is</HI> my glorying over you: I am filled with comfort, I exceedingly abound with joy, over all our affliction.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side: from without <HI>were</HI> fight∣ings,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> from within <HI>were</HI> fears. But God who comforteth them that are brought low, comforted us by the coming of Titus.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted over you, when he told us your ear∣nest desire, your grief, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> For I do not repent that I grieved you by the letter, though I did repeat: (for I see that letter grieved you, though but for a season.)
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye grieved to repentance; for ye grieved in a godly manner, so that ye received damage
<PB N="285" REF="046352_0284_10210D546CBCA300"/>by us in nothing.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For godly sorrow worketh re∣pentance unto salvation not to be repented of, whereas the sorrow of the world worketh death. For behold,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly manner, how great diligence it wrought in you, yea, clearing of yourselves, yea, indignation, yea, fear, yea, ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement desire, yea, zeal, yea re∣venge? In all things ye have approved yourselves to be pure in this matter.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And though I wrote to you, <HI>it was</HI> not for his sake who hath done the wrong, nor for his sake who had suffered it, but for the sake of manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting to you in the sight of God our diligent care over you.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort, and we rejoiced the more exceedingly in the joy of Titus, be∣cause his spirit was refreshed by you all,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> So that if I had boasted any thing of you to him, I am not ashamed; but as we speak all things to you in truth, so also our boasting to Titus is found a truth.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling. I rejoice therefore,<MILESTONE N="16"/> that I have confidence in you in all things.</P>

<P> <MILESTONE N="1"/> Moreover, brethren, we declare to you the Grace of God, bestowed on the churches in Mace∣donia,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> That in a great trial of Affliction, their overflowing joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> That to <HI>their</HI> power, I testify, and beyond <HI>their</HI> power, <HI>they</HI> were willing of themselves,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Praying us with much in∣treaty, to receive the gift and take a part in minist∣ring <HI>it</HI> to the saints.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And <HI>this they did,</HI> not as we hoped; but first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God:
<MILESTONE N="6"/> So that we desired Ti∣tus, that as he had begun before, so he would also compleat this gift among you.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> <HI>see,</HI> that ye abound in this grace also. I speak not by way of command, but that by the diligence of others, I may prove the sincerity of your love.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> And herein I give <HI>my</HI> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have began a year ago, not only to do, but also to do it willingly.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Now therefore compleat the work, that as <HI>there was</HI> a ready will, so <HI>there may</HI> be also a performance, in proportion to what ye have.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> For if there be first a ready mind, a man is accepted, according to
<PB N="287" REF="046352_0286_10210D58068ECD70"/>what he hath, not according to what he hath not. For <HI>I do</HI> not <HI>mean,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="13"/> that others should be eased, and you burthened;
<MILESTONE N="14"/> But by an equality, <HI>let</HI> your a∣bundance <HI>be</HI> at this time <HI>a supply</HI> to their want; that their abundance also may be <HI>a supply</HI> to your want,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> that there may be an equality, As it is written,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xvi. 18.@</NOTE> He that <HI>had gathered</HI> the most, had nothing over; and he that <HI>had gathered</HI> the least did not lack.</P>
<P>But thanks be to God,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> who putteth the same diligent care for you in the heart of Titus.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For he accepted indeed the exhortation, but being more forward,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> he went to you of his own accord. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is through all the churches:
<MILESTONE N="19"/> (And not only <HI>so,</HI> but he was also appointed by the churches <HI>to be</HI> a fellow-traveller with us, with this gift, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord himself, and for <HI>the declaration</HI> of our ready
<PB N="288" REF="046352_0287_10210D5ED362D848"/>mind) Avoiding this,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> lest any one should blame us in this abundance, which is administred by us. For we provide things honest,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> not only before the Lord,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> but also before men. And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more dili∣gent,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> through his great confidence in you. If <HI>any enquire</HI> concerning Titus, <HI>he is</HI> my partner, and fellow-labourer with respect to you, or <HI>concerning</HI> our brethren, <HI>they are</HI> the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Shew therefore to them before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.</P>

<MILESTONE N="2"/> I beseech, that I may not when I am pre∣sent be bold with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold toward some, who think of us as wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king after the flesh:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> For though we walk in the flesh,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare <HI>are</HI> not carnal, but mighty through God to the throwing down of strong∣holds.)
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Destroying reasonings, and every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And being in readi∣ness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedi∣ence is fulfilled.</P>
<PB N="291" REF="046352_0290_10210D6731DEE820"/>
<P>Do ye look at the outward appearance of things?
<MILESTONE N="7"/> If any man be confident, that he is Christ's, let him again think this of himself, that as he <HI>is</HI> Christ's, so <HI>are</HI> we also.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Yea, if I should boast something more also of the authority which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> That I may not seem as it were to terrify you by letters.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For <HI>his</HI> letters in∣deed, say they, <HI>are</HI> weighty and strong; but <HI>his</HI> bodily presence <HI>is</HI> weak, and <HI>his</HI> speech contempti∣ble.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Let such an one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such <HI>are</HI> we also in deed, when we are present.</P>
<P>For we presume not to equal or to compare ourselves with some of those who recommend them∣selves:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> but they among themselves limiting them∣selves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> But we will not boastingly extend ourselves beyond <HI>our</HI> measure; but according to the measure of the province which God hath allot∣ted us,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> a measure to reach even unto you. For we
<PB N="292" REF="046352_0291_10210D6AA23051C0"/>do not extend ourselves excessively, as not reaching to you; for we are come even to you, in the gospel of Christ:
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Not boastingly extending ourselves be∣yond <HI>our</HI> measure, in the labours of others; but having hope, now your faith is increased, to be inlarged by you, <HI>yet still</HI> within our province, abundantly.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> So as to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to boast in another's pro∣vince of things made ready to our hand.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> But he that glorieth,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> I wish ye would bear a little with my folly; yea,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> bear with me. For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy; for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <HI>you as</HI> as chaste virgin to Christ.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> But I fear left as the serpent de∣ceived Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> If indeed he that cometh preach another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <HI>if</HI> ye re∣ceive

<MILESTONE N="5"/> But I suppose that I fall nothing short of the very chief apostles.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> For if <HI>I am</HI> unskilful in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest to you in all things.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Have I committed an offence in humbling myself, that ye might be exalted, be∣cause I have preached the gospel of God to you at free cost?
<MILESTONE N="8"/> I spoiled other churches, taking wages <HI>of them</HI> to serve you: and when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man. For the brethren who came from Macedonia sup∣plied my want;
<MILESTONE N="9"/> and I have in all things kept my∣self from being burdensome, and will keep <HI>myself.</HI> As the truth of Christ is in me,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> this my boasting shall not be stopped in the regions of Achaia. Wherefore?
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Because I love you not? God know∣eth.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them who desire occasion, that wherein they boast, they may be found even as we.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For such <HI>are</HI> false apostles, deceitful workers,
<PB N="294" REF="046352_0293_10210D6E6DFE46D8"/>transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Therefore <HI>it is</HI> no great thing, if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righ∣teousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; but if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I also may boast a little.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> What I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Seeing many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For ye, being wise, suffer fools willingly.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> For ye suffer, if a man enslave you, if he devour <HI>you,</HI> if he take <HI>from you,</HI> if he exalt himself, if he smite you on the face.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak: whereas in whatever any is confident, (I speak as a fool) I am confident also.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Are they Hebrews? so <HI>am</HI> I. Are they Israelites? so <HI>am</HI> I. Are they the seed of Abra∣ham?

<MILESTONE N="24"/> Five times I received from the Jews forty <HI>stripes</HI> save one.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I have been shipwrecked, a day and a night I passed in the deep:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> In journey∣ings often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from the heathen, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brethren:
<MILESTONE N="27"/> In labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> in cold and nakedness. Beside the things which are from without, that which rusheth upon me daily,
<MILESTONE N="29"/> the care of all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Since I must glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmities.
<MILESTONE N="31"/> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.
<MILESTONE N="32"/> In Damascus the governor under king Aretas kept the city of the Damascenes

<P>Surely it is not expedient for me to boast: yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not; God knoweth) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Yea, I knew such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God know∣eth) That he was caught up into paradise,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and heard unspeakable things, which it is not possible for man to utter.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Of such an one I will glory; but I will not glory of myself,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> unless in my infirmities. For if I
<MILESTONE N="1"/> <PB N="297" REF="046352_0296_10210D755770D2F0"/>should resolve to boast, I should not be a fool; for I speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think of me above what he seeth me, or heareth from me.</P>
<P>And lest I should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be lifted up.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> that it might depart from me. But he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may rest upon me.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in reproaches, in ne∣cessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake;
<PB N="298" REF="046352_0297_10210D7B4E97AFF0"/>for when I am weak,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> then I am strong. I am become a fool in boasting; <HI>but</HI> ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended by you: for in nothing have I fallen short of the very chief apostles, though I am nothing.</P>
<P>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought a∣mong you,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For wherein were ye inferior to the other churches, unless that I myself was not bur∣densome to you?
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Forgive me this wrong. Behold the third time I am ready to come to you: yet I will not be burdensome to you; for I seek not yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> but the parents for the children. And I will most gladly spend, and be spent for your souls, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> But be it so: I did not burden you: but being crafty,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> I caught you with guile. Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?
<MILESTONE N="18"/> I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps?</P>
<P>Think ye that we again excuse ourselves to you?
<MILESTONE N="19"/> We speak before God in Christ, and all things, be∣loved,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> for your edification. For I fear lest when I come, I should not find you such as I would, and <HI>lest</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="046352_0298_10210D7D9470E130"/>I should be found by you such as ye would not: lest <HI>there should be</HI> contentions, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> whisperings, swellings, tumults: Lest my God should humble me when I come to you again, and I should mourn over many of them who had sinned before, and have not repented of the un∣cleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.</P>

<P>I am coming to you this third time: every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three wit∣nesses.

<MILESTONE N="4"/> but powerful among you. For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God: and we also are weak with him; but we shall live with him, by the power of God in you.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Examine yourselves whe∣ther ye are in the faith: prove yourselves. Do ye not know yourselves, That Jesus Christ is in you? unless ye are reprobates.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And I trust, ye shall

<MILESTONE N="8"/> For we can do nothing against the truth,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> but for the truth. For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish,

<P>Finally,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> PAUL,
an apostle (not of men, neither by man,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> but by Jesus Christ, and God the Fa∣ther, who raised him from the dead) And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Ga∣latia;
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Grace <HI>be</HI> to you, and peace from God the Father,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and the Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
<PB N="303" REF="046352_0302_10210D8AF7DA2C08"/>
<P>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him who called you by the grace of Christ,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> to another gospel,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But if we, or an angel from heaven preach to you another gospel than we have preached to you,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> let him be accursed: As we have said before, so I say now again, if any one preach to you ano∣ther gospel than that ye received, let him be ac∣cursed.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For do I now satisfy men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</P>
<P>But I certify you,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> For neither did I receive it from man, nei∣ther was I taught <HI>it,</HI> but by the revelation of Jesus
<PB N="304" REF="046352_0303_10210D8D5D1D5A98"/>Christ.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For ye have heard of my behaviour in time past in the Jewish religion, that above mea∣sure I persecuted the Church of God, and wasted it. And I profited in the Jewish religion above many of my years among my countrymen,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <HI>me</HI> by his grace, To reveal his Son in me,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood:
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to them that were apostles before me, but I immedi∣ately went into Arabia, and returned again to Da∣mascus.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and abode with him fif∣teen days.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But other of the apostles I saw none,

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Then fourteen years after,
I went up again to Jerusalem with Bar∣nabas,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> taking Titus also with me. But I went up by revelation, and laid before them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles; but severally to those of eminence, lest by any means I should run, or should have run in vain.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> (But neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcis∣ed,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Because of false brethren introduced unawares, who had slipped in, to spy out our liberty which we have through Christ Jesus, that they might bring us
<PB N="306" REF="046352_0305_10210D9562E05C28"/>into bondage:
<MILESTONE N="5"/> To whom we did not yield by sub∣mission, no, not an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.)
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And they who un∣doubtedly were something, (<HI>but</HI> whatsoever they were, it is no difference to me: God accepteth no man's person) they who undoubtedly were some∣thing,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> added nothing to me. But on the contrary, when they saw that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter <HI>with that</HI> of the cir∣cumcision:
<MILESTONE N="8"/> (For he that wrought effectually in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought like∣wise effectually in me toward the Gentiles:)
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And when James, and Cephas, and John, who undoubted∣ly were pillars, knew the grace that was given to me, they gave the right-hands of fellowship to me and Barnabas, that we <HI>should go</HI> to the Gentiles, and they
<PB N="307" REF="046352_0306_10210D9A20CA7090"/>to the circumcision:
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Only <HI>they desired</HI> that we would be mindful of the poor, which very thing I also was forward to do.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> For before some came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And the other Jews also dissembled with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> But when I saw, that they did not walk uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <HI>them</HI> all, If thou being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not of the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to ju∣daize?
<MILESTONE N="15"/> We <HI>who are</HI> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Even we (knowing that a man is
<PB N="308" REF="046352_0307_10210D9CD37815C8"/>not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ) have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <HI>is</HI> Christ therefore the minister of sin? God forbid.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> For if I build again the things which I de∣stroyed,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> I make myself a transgressor. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God. I am crucified with Christ,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> and I live no longer, but
<PB N="309" REF="046352_0308_10210DA15582E1B8"/>Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and delivered up himself for me.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> I do not make void the grace of God; for if righteousness <HI>is</HI> by the law, then Christ died in vain.</P>

<MILESTONE N="22"/> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up together unto the faith which was to be revealed. Wherefore the law was our school-master unto Christ,

<MILESTONE N="18"/> But if ye are led by the Spirit,

<HEAD>NOTES ON St. PAUL's Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>EPHESUS was the chief City of that Part of <HI>Asia,</HI> which was a <HI>Roman</HI> Province. Here St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached for three Years, (<HI>Acts</HI> xx. 31.) and from hence the Gospel was spread throughout the whole Province, (<HI>Acts</HI> xix. 10.) At his taking Leave of the Church there, he forewarned them both of great Persecutions from without, and of divers Heresies and Schisms, which would arise among them∣selves. And accordingly he writes this Epistle (nearly resembling that to the <HI>Colossians,</HI> written about the same Time) to establish them in the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine he had delivered, to arm them against false Teachers, and to build them up in Love and Holiness, both of Heart and Con∣versation.</P>
<P>He begins this, as most of his Epistles, with Thanksgiving to GOD, for their embracing and adhering to the Gospel. He s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ews the ines∣timable Blessings and Advantages they received thereby, as far above all the <HI>Jewish</HI> Privileges, as all the Wisdom and Philosophy of the Heathens. He proves, that our LORD is the Head of the whole Church: Of Angels and Spirits, the Church Triumphant, and of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w equally Members of the Church Militant. In the three last Chapters he exhorts them to various Duties, civil and religious, personal and relative, suitable to their Christian Character. Privileges, Assistances, and Obligations.</P>

<MILESTONE N="4"/> But God, being rich in mer∣cy, through his great love wherewith he loved us, Hath quickened even us together with Christ,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> who were dead in trespasses, (by grace ye are sav∣ed) And hath raised <HI>us</HI> up together,

<PB N="332" REF="046352_0331_10210DED1B8384A0"/>us through Christ Jesus.

<MILESTONE N="9"/> Not by works, lest any one should boast.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For we are his workmanship, created through Christ Jesus unto good works, which God had before prepared, that we might walk in them.</P>
<P>Wherefore remember,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> that ye <HI>being</HI> formerly Gentiles in the flesh (who were called the uncir∣cumcision, by that which is called the circumcision performed with hands in the flesh.)
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the common∣wealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise; having no hope, and without God in
<PB N="333" REF="046352_0332_10210DF0B6548220"/>in the world.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> But now through Christ Jesus, ye who were formerly far off are brought nigh by the blood of Christ.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For he is our peace, he who hath made both one, having broken down the middle wall of partition,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Having abolished by his flesh the enmity, the law of commandments, through <HI>his</HI> decrees, that he might form the two into one new man in himself,

<MILESTONE N="2"/> With all lowliness, and meekness; with long-suffering forbear one another in love,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> En∣deavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit, by the bond of peace.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> <HI>There is</HI> one body and Spirit, as ye are also called in one hope of your calling;
<MILESTONE N="5"/> One Lord,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> one faith, one baptism: One God, and Fa∣ther of all, who <HI>is</HI> above all, and through all, and in us all.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxviii. 18.@</NOTE> Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men. (Now this <HI>expression,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="9"/> He ascended, what is it, but that he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth?
<MILESTONE N="10"/> He that descended is the same that
<PB N="338" REF="046352_0337_10210E01D5A04CF8"/>ascended also, far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> ) And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers;
<MILESTONE N="12"/> For the perfection of the saints, for the work of the ministry, to the edifying the body of Christ;
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the sta∣ture of the fulness of Christ:
<MILESTONE N="14"/> That we may be no longer children, fluctuating to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, by cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:
<MILESTONE N="15"/> But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> <HI>even</HI> Christ: From whom the
<PB N="339" REF="046352_0338_10210E067B25CCC8"/>whole body fitly joined together and compacted; by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every mem∣ber, maketh an increase of the body, to the edify∣ing of itself in love.</P>
<P>This therefore I say and testify in the Lord,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of your mind:
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Having the understand∣ing darkened, being alienated from the life of God, by the ignorance that is in them, through the hard∣ness of their hearts:
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Who being past feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all un∣cleanness with greediness.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But ye have not so learned Christ;
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Seeing ye have heard him, and been taught by him,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> (as the truth is in Jesus) To put off, with respect to the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceit∣ful
<PB N="340" REF="046352_0339_10210E0B0B2F5B88"/>desires:
<MILESTONE N="23"/> But to be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And to put on the new man, which is created after God, in righteousness and true holiness.</P>
<P>Wherefore putting away lying,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> speak ye every man truth with his neighbour; for we are members one of another.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> Be ye angry, and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Neither give place to the devil.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Let him that stole, steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> Let no corrupt discourse proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hear∣ers.
<MILESTONE N="30"/> And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, where∣by ye have been sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness,
<MILESTONE N="31"/> and wrath, and anger, and clamour,
<PB N="341" REF="046352_0340_10210E0D5D60EF60"/>and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice.
