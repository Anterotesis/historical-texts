<P>THE motto of this paper gives a specimen of Roman, the proceedings against America, of English policy.—There is, and must necessarily be, a compact, either express, or im∣plyed, between every sovereign and subject. Pro∣tection and obedience are the mutual stipulations, if the one is withdrawn, the other ceases. Now, protection is certainly withdrawn, when subjects, guilty of no hostile or rebellious act, (I defy the ministry to prove one against them) are neverthe∣less treated (like the Americans) as enemies and rebels. Administration, most falsely and auda∣ciously, stigmatize them with the name of rebels, merely to colour their own base designs, and un∣justifiable
<PB N="130" REF="013982_0002_0F925989A5B5ABD8"/>hostilities against their fellow-subjects; in whom they discern an odious spirit of liberty, which sets (for them) a dangerous example to the mother country. The noble flame is dying here, and it would be fatal to ministerial designs, that it should be cherished in any part of our dominions.</P>
<P>The spirited Americans feel this truth, they fore∣see, and wisely guard against the danger. They have convened, and consulted for the public safety, like true Britons. What then? Is such a national, political congress, a traiterous association? At such a time too, and in such a cause? Is the situation and circumstances of America (a nation in point of territory and numbers) to be compared to that of Truro (a rotten borough) in Cornwall? Buffoonery in serious cases, Doctor Johnson, dishonours human nature, and degrades human understanding. Not even the example of your master, Doctor, who played Falstaff, after he had deluded a late unhap∣py Lord Chancellor of England into suicide, can sanctify dramatic pleasantry, at the expence of life, liberty, property, and a whole country.</P>
<P>"Kill the next Piercy yourself," my lord, is a species of drollery, in a case of blood, unworthy even of a hackney writer; as to you, Doctor John∣son,—I do not expect you will write honestly, but write sensibly. Treat subjects, (which might even affect the humanity of a Scotchman) no more lu∣dicrously, indecently, unfeelingly, and abandonly. With your leave, Doctor, I once more call Ame∣rica a nation, and a great nation; too far distant from her mother country, to receive from her either
<PB N="135" REF="013982_0003_0F92598A3ABFF678"/>colonies, Thus, (says Dr. Johnson) they have defrauded their creditors here, and condemned our merchants to bankruptcy. If creditors and mer∣chants suffer, if manufacturers complain, they must recur to the first cause. These are the pernicious effects of the wise steps, taken first by the ministe∣rial aggressors in this country. Nor is it to be won∣dered at, if the consequence of these rash and un∣just proceedings by the harpies of power, should produce (in case of an approaching war with France and Spain) a general bankruptcy of this nation.— A thought by no means chimerical, but truly me∣lancholy; a thought, which can neither be baffled by the buffoonery of hackney scribblers, the grave sarcasms of statesmen, or the cruel pleasantry of thoughtless Majesty itself.</P>
