<P>The Duty of Ministers to aim at <HI>promoting,</HI> and <HI>being Partakers</HI> of the Gospel.</P>
<P>A <HI>SERMON</HI> Preach'd at the ORDINATION OF Mr. <HI>Benjamin Parker</HI> To the Pastoral Care of a Church in <HI>Haverhill, November</HI> 28. 1744 Made publick at the Desire of the venerable <HI>Council</HI> (consisting of Eleven Churches) conven'd on that Occasion, and a con∣siderable Number of other Ministers and Gentlemen.</P>
<P>By WILLIAM BALCH, A. M. Pastor of a Church in <HI>Bradford.</HI></P>
<Q>He stood in too much Awe of his great Master, to fear or know any Man, [in the Discharge of his Duty] or to be sway'd by any worldly Considerations. He believ'd firmly, that he must render an Account of his Conduct at the Day of Judgment, and wisely re∣solv'd so to act, as that he might do it with rejoicing.</Q>

<Q><BIBL><HI>I Cor. IX. 23.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And this I do for the Gospel's Sake, that I might be Partaker thereof with you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MEEKNESS and Patience, and a mutual Con∣descension and Forbearance towards one another, are Duties incumbent on all the Disciples of Christ. The Example of their great Lord, as well as his Doctrine, was peculiarly calculated to inforce and recommend them, as being of eminent Note in the Christian Scheme. And if we take a View of the State of Things in the World, and consider the incredible Mischiefs that have arisen to Mankind from their Pride and Peevishness, and their insulting and domineering over one another; we shall soon be convinc'd, that these Duties are not only of the last Importance to the present Ease and Quiet of Men in the va∣rious Relations and Affairs of this Life, but Reason will tell us, they cannot be less necessary to prepare them for the Society and Happiness of the future World; where there shall be no∣thing to hurt and destroy, or to grieve and vex the blessed Inha∣bitants forever.</P>
<P>But though these Duties are incumbent on all Christians, and should make a distinguishing Part of their Character from the Rest of Mankind; yet the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ should look up∣on themselves as in particular call'd to excel in them. Their Relation to Christ beyond that of Christians in common, and the Nature and Business of their Office, <HI>viz.</HI> to teach the Re∣ligion of Christ to others should be considered by them, as a perpetual Admonition to 'em to approach the nearest possible to the Likeness of Christ, and be a Pattern themselves to the Rest of their Fellow-Christians. The great Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="005332_0004_1017003F15CFEC60"/>whose Example next to that of our Blessed Saviour, is the most eminent of any one recorded in the New-Testament, took particular Care of his Duty in these Respects: And we are very frequently notified of it, to the End, without Doubt, that others in the sacred Office might be excited from thence <HI>to go and do likewise;</HI> and become Followers of this <HI>prime Minister</HI> of the Christian Church, as he followed Christ the <HI>Author and Finisher of our Faith.</HI> Hence in the Text, after a large Ac∣count, through the whole foregoing Part of the Chapter, of his Meekness and Forbearance and Condescension towards all Sorts of Persons under the various Prejudices of their Education, and the different Turns of Mind with which they atten∣ded on his Ministry, the Apostle assigns the Reason of such his Conduct: Saying, <HI>And this I do for the Gospel's Sake, that I might be Partaker thereof with you;</HI> giving us to understand, he did not condescend to the Weaknesses and Prejudices of People, to aggrandise himself in their Esteem, or that by little mean popular Arts he might exalt himself above his Brethren, employ'd in the same evangelical Ministry: Much less did he do it, that by working on their Passions, he might obtain such a Mastery over their Understandings, as to be able to manage them to his own particular Humour, and serve his worldly Ends by them: This was too much the Manner of false Teachers; but he did it <HI>for the Gospel's Sake,</HI> i. e. as he expresses it in some of the foregoing Verses, that he might gain and save them, <HI>viz.</HI> gain them to Christ and not to himself, and save them from the Dominion of their Lusts, and not from the due Exercise of their Reason: And that what he aim'd at with Respect to himself, was to be a Sharer of the same Benefits, and a Partaker of the Gospel with them.</P>
<P>There are two Things here imply'd which I shall make the Heads of the ensuing Discourse
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the Ministers of Christ ought to aim at being Parta∣kers of the Gospel, in common with all the Faithful. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That in Order hereto, they ought to set up the Gospel in their View, as that for the promoting of which their Office was design'd; and in the Reputation, Defence, Success, and Propagation of which, all their ministerial Endeavours should center.</ITEM>

I. That the Ministers of Christ ought to aim at being Parta∣kers of the Gospel in common with all the Faithful. <HI>That I might be Partaker thereof with you.</HI></P>
<P>Ministers have the same Concern and Interest in the Christi∣an Religion with the rest of Mankind. They have Souls to save or lose as well as their People; their Lives are equally pre∣carious and uncertain; <HI>their Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor their Flesh of Brass;</HI> they have the precious Trea∣sure of the Gospel but in <HI>Earthen Vessels,</HI> that are soon and ea∣sily dash'd to Pieces—And they are no more exempted from appearing in the last Judgment: <HI>They must give Account of them∣selves to God</HI> as well as the rest of Mankind, <HI>and receive the Things done in the Body whether they have been good or evil.</HI> They ought not then to be so intent upon the saving of others as to neglect their own Salvation. It should seem indeed as if this was in no wise likely ever to happen. But they that know the Multiplicity of Cares and perpetual Hurry of Business in which the Ministry for the most Part involves a Man, will not think such a Caution needless. There are, 'tis true, some Ad∣vantages of a religious Nature attending on an Employment in the Work of the Ministry: but then the Temptations likewise peculiar to that Office, or more especially besetting those who are employ'd in it, are in a great Measure a Ballance to them. And if any should grow remiss upon this Account, under Pre∣tence that they are continually taken up in religious and spiri∣tual Affairs, it would certainly be a great and most dangerous Mistake.</P>
<P>It is constantly found, that Ministers are Men of like Passi∣ons with others; and though good People are apt to conceive a more rais'd Opinion of their Sanctity than of their own, or of other Men's, yet it will not from hence follow, that Mini∣sters should think thus of themselves: Nor can there be any Foundation for it meerly from their being employ'd in the sa∣cred Function. This indeed should be a Motive to them to ex∣cell in all Christian Goodness and Virtue; that they may be Examples to <HI>Believers in Word, in Conversation, in Spirit, in Faith, in Charity, in Purity:</HI> But then in Order hereto, per∣sonal Religion must be no small Part of their Care; and while they are employ'd in keeping the Vineyard for others, they must not neglect their own. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in many Places
<PB N="8" REF="005332_0006_10170043CB9CABE8"/>informs us of his own daily Exercise herein; <HI>he kept under his Body, and brought it into Subjection, lest that by any Means, when he had preached to others, he himself should be a Cast-away.</HI> He took Care to have his Conversation in the World in <HI>Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not according to fleshly Wisdom, but the Grace of God.</HI> He was <HI>willing in all Things to live honestly,</HI> and used his utmost Endeavours <HI>to keep a Conscience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Man.</HI> And in the Text, to insist up∣on no other Place at present, <HI>This I do for the Gospel's Sake,</HI> THAT I MIGHT BE PARTAKER THEREOF WITH YOU. This shews what he had in View with Respect to himself, <HI>namely</HI> to be a Sharer with all the Faithful in the Bene∣fits of the Gospel, to experience its Divine Energy in changing and transforming him into the Image of Christ in this present World; and then in the World to come, to be a Partaker of eternal Life, which is the great and final Reward the Gospel proposes. Here then,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Ministers should aim at being Partakers of the <HI>saving Efficacy</HI> of Gospel-Truths. They should not content them∣selves with meerly teaching the Truths of the Gospel to others, (though this they should do very diligently, it being a main Branch of their Office,) but in Order to their own Salvation they should likewise see to it, that they experience in themselves the effectual Operation of those Truths purifying and governing their Hearts and Lives.</P>
<P>It is not teaching the Truths of the Gospel, but obeying and living them, that will denominate us good Men. Whenever therefore we are preaching upon any important Subject to our People, we should, as often as may be, bring the Matter home, to ourselves by such serious, solemn Reflections as these, <Q>How am I affected, and what is my own Concern herein? What is the State of my own Soul in Reference to these Things! And what have I to do more than I have yet done in Order to a due Improvement of these Truths, that I may not be condemn'd in the last Day <HI>out of my own Mouth?</HI></Q> Oh my Brethren! It will be a dreadful Thing to have the Judge say to any of us, <HI>Thou wicked Servant, out of thine own Mouth will I condemn thee.</HI> And yet this will certainly be the Case, be we ever so diligent in <HI>teaching</HI> the Gospel to others, if we are not careful to <HI>live</HI> it our selves. We must be renew'd in
<PB N="9" REF="005332_0007_101700456B1EE8F0"/>the Spirit of our Minds, the Knowledge of the Truth must make us free; we must be sanctified by our Faith in Christ, and be inspired and animated to a Victory over the World, or it is impossible we should be sav'd. The Want of these Things can no more dispensed with in Ministers than others: Yea, but higher Attainments are requir'd, <HI>for to him that knoweth to do Good and doth it not, to him it is Sin. And that Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepar'd not himself, nor did ac∣cording to it, shall be beaten with many Stripes.</HI> This then we should continually aim at, to find in ourselves the powerful Ef∣fect of those Truths which we preach to our People; that ha∣ving the Spirit of Christ, and being full of Goodness and Righ∣teousness, we may appear to be his, and to have a real, saving Interest in him.</P>
<P>And to encourage, excite and animate us hereto, we should also,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Aim at being Partakers of the Gospel, as that Phrase may signify our being Partakers of the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> which the Gospel reveals.</P>
<P>It can be no more unlawful in Ministers than in private Chri∣stians <HI>to have a Respect to the Recompence of Reward;</HI> and to animate themselves to their Duty from the Consideration of the Glory and Happiness of the future World. As this is the greatest that can be, <HI>what Eye had not seen, nor Ear heard, nor had entered into the Heart of Man,</HI> before the Gospel discovered it; so, no Doubt, this Discovery was made, that we might, from thence forward, set this Glory and Happiness up in our View, and earnestly aspire at being Partakers of it. If this had been unlawful, an infinitely wise and merciful God would ne∣ver have made the Discovery; because it would have been cast∣ing such a Stumbling-Block in the Way of his reasonable and intelligent Creatures, as must (unless they had acted in plain Contradiction to the Nature which he himself had given them) inevitably prove their Ruin.</P>
<P>It is certainly then not only lawful, but a Duty both in Mi∣nisters and People, to aim at being Partakers of the Gospel in this latter Sense, when they likewise aim at being Partakers of it in the former, i. e. to aim at Glory and Happiness in the Way of Holiness and Virtue. And it is only unlawful and absurd, when Men don't seek, and aim, and labour after it in the
<PB N="10" REF="005332_0008_10170049A797E128"/>Way the Gospel prescribes, but in Ways of their own Supersti∣tion; not by a lively, effectual Faith in the Son of God, chang∣ing their Hearts, and reforming their Lives; not by Obedience to the Gospel, and the Practice of that Goodness and Righte∣ousness which it requires; but either by some or other Scheme of meer speculative Notions, or by the Practice of such Things as are no where requir'd at their Hands; when Jesus Christ is not made the chief Corner Stone of the Building, and the Foundation of their Hope is not laid in the Merit of his Blood and Righteousness; but they either imagine their own Doings sufficient to recommend them to God, without the Benefit of the Gospel-Covenant, and the Intercession of the Saviour; or else, that be their Doings what they will, they are neither the nearer, nor yet the farther off from a just and rational Hope of eternal Life.</P>
<P>Both these are dangerous Errors, and Ministers and People should equally guard against them: Either that we have no Need of the Blood of Christ to cleanse us from our Sins, and of his Intercession to recommend our Persons and Performances to the Divine Acceptance; or else, that be our Persons and Performances what they will, whether we be Wicked or God∣ly, whether we live like Christians or live like Heathen, the Blood of Christ may be equally ours and we hope to be sav'd by it, ONLY IF WE TAKE CARE CONFIDENTLY TO EXPECT IT, AND BE SURE NOT TO BE IN∣FLUENC'D BY IT TO LIVE ANY BETTER THAN WE SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE. We should beware, my Brethren, how by any Means we go into such Sentiments: Or, so far as it shall be in our Power to pre∣vent it, suffer any of our People to do so. The former Opi∣nion is entirely subversive of Christianity; and the latter, e∣ven of moral Virtue and Honesty. Infidels err the former Way, and Enthusiasts generally the latter. Let us look for e∣ternal Life, but look for it <HI>as a Gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord;</HI> and as a Gift which he will only bestow upon them that <HI>have their Fruit unto Holiness;</HI> and let the Belief and Ex∣pectation hereof have a powerful, abiding Influence upon us. The more it influences us to Holiness and Virtue, so much the better; even if under the Influence of this Divine Hope we should purify ourseves, as he that calls us to Glory and Virtue, is pure; if, <HI>forasmuch as we know that our Labour is not in
<PB N="11" REF="005332_0009_1017004DDA8959A8"/>vain in the Lord,</HI> we should from thence seek always to abound in the Exercises of our Christian Duty, and if, under the Re∣proaches and Terrors of an evil World, we should be stedfast and immoveable, and undaunted, and unfainting <HI>while we look not at the Things that are seen and are temporal, but at the Things which are not seen and are eternal.</HI> In a Word, This is such a Spring and Principle both of active and passive Obedience to the Will of God, as no good Man, and much less Christian Minister can spare; and we should never therefore suffer it to be wrested out of our Hands. What shall we do, when the Times are such (as they have more than once been, and may be again, if God should see Cause righteously to permit it) that if in this Life only we had Hope, we should of all Men be most miserable; I say, what shall we do, if we have not then a <HI>Hope entering into that within the Vail, which as an An∣chor of the Soul both free and stedfast,</HI> may keep it safe amidst the Storm; and be a Means of that blessed Tranquillity, as to put us out of Danger of making <HI>Shipwreck of Faith or of a good Conscience?</HI> For my own Part, I shall endeavour to be always firmly possess'd of this Principle: Aiming at Glory and Vir∣tue, <HI>and forgetting the Things that are behind, and reaching forth unto those that are before, I will press forward towards the Mark for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Christ Jesus:</HI> Nor will I ever be asham'd to profess my self as acting in <HI>Hope of Eternal Life which God that cannot lie, hath pro∣mised.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to the other general Head proposed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. To shew that in Order hereto, the Ministers of Christ ought to set up the Gospel in their View, as that for the pro∣moting of which their Office was design'd; and in the Repu∣tation, Defence, Success, and Propagation of which, all their ministerial Endeavours should center.</P>
<P>The Ministers of Christ have not only <HI>themselves to save</HI> but also <HI>them that hear them:</HI> And they can't secure their own Sal∣vation, unless they likewise sincerely endeavour the saving of their Charge; which is the End of their Office, and that for which it was set up in the Church. They are to be <HI>Helping</HI> of the Faith and Holiness and Comfort of the People of <HI>God.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="005332_0010_1017004F5FF81118"/>They are to teach the Disciples of Christ to <HI>observe all those Things</HI> which he <HI>commanded;</HI> and are perpetually to admonish them that profess to believe in God, <HI>to be careful to main∣tain good Works;</HI> and so adorn their Christian Professi∣on.</P>
<P>The very Business of Ministers as such, is to promote the Gospel, i. e. a right Understanding and firm Belief of the Doc∣trines of Christ, and a Conversation in all those who profess the same, agreeable thereto. And next to their own Salvation this should ever lay upon their Minds, <HI>viz.</HI> promoting the Vir∣tue and Happiness of those with whose Instruction they are in∣trusted: Shewing them the good and right Way, and perswa∣ding them to walk in it: Laying before them the Precepts and Motives of the Gospel, and from Time to Time impressing their Minds with a Sense of the Reality, Nearness, and infinite Importance of unseen, eternal Things. The making of their People good and happy, next to securing the Favour of God, and eternal Happiness for themselves, should be their great Care and governing Design. Not their own secular Advantage, not their Grandeur, not their Ease, not their own Reputation or Life, should lay so near their Hearts, as promoting the Know∣ledge of Christ in their People, leading them to a true Faith in him, and guiding them in Paths of Virtue and true Holiness to eternal Glory. For this End, and with this in their View, the should be a always ready to deny themselves, and take up their Cross; <HI>not pleasing themselves, nor seeking their own Profit, but the Profit of many that they may be saved:</HI> With Prudence and Meekness instructing and perswading those that oppose themselves, <HI>if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the Acknowledgment of the Truth.</HI> The Design of the Gospel is to make Men good and happy: and this is what Ministers are to be carrying on; <HI>as Workers together under God, beseeching Men not to receive his Grace in vain.</HI> And if they meet with Op∣position herein, they are not presently to call for Fire from Heaven; but by Gentleness and Goodness, Forbearance and Longsuffering, should seek to overcome their Lusts and Preju∣dices.</P>
<P>Indeed there may be Instances, and at certain Seasons they may abound, wherein, if Ministers should be more resolute, they would not want the Countenance of Scripture. The great Apostle St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who in our Text and Context men∣tions
<PB N="13" REF="005332_0011_10170051250591D0"/>his Condescension, without Doubt, as being examplary, and worthy of Imitation, does elsewhere speak of his very resolute Behaviour, and even glory in his not <HI>giving Place by Subjection to Adversaries; no, not for an Hour.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 2.5.</NOTE> And says, <HI>If I yet pleased Men I should not be the Servant of Christ,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ch. 1.10.</NOTE> i. e. if he made it his main Design to render himself agreeable to the Lusts and Prejudices of those he convers'd with, and for the Sake of pleasing Men in Sentiments opposite to his own, should violate the Light and Conviction of his own Mind and Conscience, he should not behave himself at all sutable to the Character of a Christian Minister. Where Good may be rati∣onally hoped for from Moderation, a condescending Forbear∣ance, and meek and patient Instruction, it is, no Doubt, to be practis'd: But some Tempers are not to be wrought on or gain'd in that Way. The Apostle <HI>Jude</HI> therefore exhorts, <HI>of some have Compassion, making a Difference; and others save with Fear, pulling them out of the Fire.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jude 22, and 23d Verses.</NOTE> It remains then that in all the Particulars of their Conduct, the Ministers of Christ need that <HI>Wisdom which is profitable to direct;</HI> and should daily ask it of God, who has promised to give it liberally. And what I have said is, that in general, this End is per∣petually to be had in View, and is what they should make the ruling Measure of their Conduct; <HI>promoting the Gospel of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>But then there are diverse Things pertaining to the Gos∣pel, which ought to be a little more distinctly considered, upon Account of the Influence they should have upon us, as,</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Reputation</HI> of the Gospel. This should be unspeak∣ably dearer to us than our own. Our own Reputation is but a little Thing and of little Worth, further than as it may ren∣der us more extensively serviceable in our Day and Generation. In this View of it, a good Name is very desireable. and can hardly be set at too high a Rate; but in other Respects, Re∣proach and Obloquy may perhaps be safer for us. To be sure, neither the Praise nor Dispraise of Men, Can be of any Con∣sequence to us long; for we shall not stand or fall by their
<PB N="14" REF="005332_0012_10170054590E3328"/>Judgment upon the last Trial. But the Reputation of the Gos∣pel is of the vastest Consequence, as the Happiness of Millions, even their eternal Happiness, has a Dependance upon the Re∣ception and Entertainment which they shall give to it. The Gospel is not at all likely to profit those who have no Opinion of its Worth and Excellency: If Men take up mean, low, and contemptuous Thoughts of the Christian Religion, they will treat it accordingly. Ministers therefore should be infi∣nitely tender of doing any Thing that may turn to its Re∣proach; and on the other Hand, they should neglect nothing but do every Thing in their Power, to give it Credit and In∣fluence among Men. But here suffer me to say, we are not to imagine as if we could do this, <HI>promote the Honour and Reputation of the Gospel,</HI> by making Additions to it of our own: As if it could receive Perfection from our Imperfection. A vain Design, a most foolish Attempt! The Gospel will e∣ver be most beautiful in its own native Simplicity. When it was first thus taught in the first and purest Times of the Church, it had wonderful Reputation and Success. And if we would preserve to it, in any Measure, the same honourable Esteem and efficacious Influence, we must be careful to teach the <HI>Truth as it is in Jesus:</HI> We must strip the Religion of Christ of those ugly and false Disguises that have been put upon it by weak or ill-minded Men: We must distinguish from it, and put away, what is of meer human Invention: For with this corrupt Mixture, the Reputation of the Gospel must needs sink, and the Defence of it be insufficient: The Addi∣tion being in no wise equal to what is genuine; nor of the same Nature with it, but for the most Part, irrational and ab∣surd. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was exceeding zealous against an∣nexing to Christianity the <HI>Jewish</HI> Rites and Ceremonies; be∣cause he knew they would marr its Beauty, and weaken its Influence with a great Part of Mankind. And the Additions that have been made to it since that Time, especially in <HI>Popish</HI> Countries, have been far from being less detrimental than those would have been.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Defence</HI> of the Gospel should be another Part of the Minister's Care. To this Purpose the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in his E∣pistles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> prescribes, that a <HI>Bishop</HI> or Chris∣tian Minister should not only be of modest and good Behavi∣our,
<PB N="15" REF="005332_0013_101700587842CD30"/>but one <HI>apt to teach, a Workman that needeth not to be a∣shamed, and able by sound Doctrine to convince Gainsayers; for there are many unruly and vain Talkers,</HI> says he, <HI>whose Mouths must be stop'd, who subvert whole Houses.</HI> And is not a good Measure of human Literature requisite hereto? Many of the <HI>Adversaries</HI> of Christianity are Men of some Learning; and what a miserable, pitiful Figure will an <HI>illiterate</HI> Minister make, should he chance to fall into such Hands! we are not born Workmen at any Thing: But must be instructed and educat∣ed to the Business in which we would serve our Generation. And shall the sacred Calling only cost a Man no Pains to pre∣pare for it? Is every Man <HI>apt to teach?</HI> Are all <HI>able to convince Gainsayers?</HI> And yet I don't see but that Ministers should be furnished and qualified in these Respects in some good Measure, or else, that their very undertaking the Work must be esteem'd unlawful. Indeed it is not to be expected that all Ministers should be alike able and skilful herein; but the least that can be reasonably requir'd is, that they should be Men of good natural Powers, and have had some suitable Advantage for Improvement. Upon this Account, the happy Foundati∣on laid by our Forefathers for the training up of Youth for the Service of the Sanctuary, can never (I think) be enough ad∣mired by us their Posterity: Nor shall we shew our selves worthy of such Ancestors, should we ever suffer the least Con∣tempt to be cast upon our <HI>Colleges</HI> without due Resentment. Every sincere Friend to the Religious Interests of this Coun∣try, I believe will heartily join with me in saying, May these flourishing Societies still flourish in good Sense and useful Learning, as well as Piety and universal Virtue; and may our Churches be supplied from them with pastors that shall feed them with Knowledge and Understanding, and be the Defence as well as Ornament of the Gospel, as long as the Sun and Moon shall endure.</P>
<P>I pass on,</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Thing that the Hearts of Ministers are to be much set upon, is the <HI>Success</HI> of the Gospel upon those who profess it. Alas, it is the Want of this that creates the great∣est Difficulty in the Defence of Christianity. Had the Chri∣tian Religion but its due Influence upon the Hearts and Lives of its Professors, all Mankind would soon acknowledge its Di∣vine
<PB N="16" REF="005332_0014_1017005CA26DA110"/>Original and Excellency. There is nothing else wanting to render the Christian Church <HI>the Perfection of Beauty;</HI> and to attract the Eyes, and engage the Esteem of the admiring Nations. Let but <HI>Zion</HI> become a <HI>Mountain of Holiness,</HI> and it would soon be <HI>the Joy of the whole Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This then should be the Minister's main Care, to instruct his People in the Nature, and to convince them of the Neces∣sity of true Holiness; that <HI>except a Man be born again he can∣not see the Kingdom of God;</HI> that <HI>they which profess to believe in God must be careful to maintain good Works;</HI> and that all, in the various Relations of Life, who call themselves Christians are under an indispensable Obligation to <HI>deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts and to live soberly, righteously and godlily in the World.</HI></P>
<P>These Things Christian Ministers must speak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority: And they must repeat the awful Cautions so often found in Scripture, <HI>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: For whatsoever a Man soweth that shall he also reap.— He that soweth to his Flesh shall of the Flesh reap Corruption: But he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap Life everlasting.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.7, 8.</NOTE> And, <HI>let no Man deceive you,</HI> (the Holy Ghost foreseeing what Opposition this Doctrine which is according to Godliness, would meet with in the several Ages of the Church) <HI>he that doth Righteousness is righteous. He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.— In this the Children of God are manifest and the Children of the Devil: Whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Bro∣ther.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I John 3.7, 10.</NOTE> And they must command their People's Attention, and oblige them not to overlook such plain Passages as those, Rom. 2.6, 7, 8. <HI>Who will render to every Man according to his Deeds: To them that by patient Continuance in well-doing, seek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, eternal Life. But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Un∣righteousness; Indignation and Wrath.—And, 2 Thess. 1.7, 8.9.—The Lord Jesus shall be reveal'd from Heaven— in Flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel:—Who shall be punish'd with

<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4. The Ministers of Christ should be concern'd for the <HI>Pro∣pagation</HI> of the Gospel, or a farther Spread of Christian Know∣ledge than it has hitherto obtian'd. It should be their Heart's Desire, and their daily Prayer to God, that <HI>all Men may be sa∣ved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth:</HI> Nor should they be wanting in any proper methods, to contribute their utmost Endeavours that <HI>the People which sit in Darkness, and dwell in the Region and Shadow of Death,</HI> may be favour'd with this great Light. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was in a particular Manner concern'd for this; therefore <HI>strove to preach the Gospel, where Christ had not been so much as nam'd.</HI> Indeed the oridi∣nary Ministers of Christ, who are Officers in particular Chur∣ches, are not oblig'd, or at Liberty in this Respect, as the A∣postles were, who had it in their Commission to go into all the World, and to preach the Gospel to every Creature: Where∣as these have their particular Stations and Provinces assigned them. These were in Primitive Times <HI>ordain'd in every City;</HI> and their Charge was to <HI>feed the Flock of God over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers.</HI> Their Business was not so much to plant Churches, as to take Care of those commit∣ted to their particular Oversight. The Apostles, and other extraordinary Persons rais'd up by God for that Purpose, were to <HI>Disciple</HI> the Nations, and gather them into distinct Christi∣an Bodies: And then those who were put in Trust, in the several Churches by them, were to maintain Christianity where they had planted it. Not that New Churches might not un∣der their Direction be formed and gather'd out of old ones, as their Numbers should increase and their Circumstances call for it; this was necessary even to the Maintenance of Christian∣ity where it had been planted by the Apostles; but what I would be understood arguing against, is the Practice of those, who, though ordinary Ministers (if any at all) yet as if they were Apostles, go from Place to Place, and from Country to Country, either having no proper Charges of their own, or neglecting them, if they have any, and rambling a∣bout
<PB N="18" REF="005332_0016_101700338CEEF960"/>in those of other Men's, exciting Parties and Factions: Which is so far from being a Means to propagate the Gospel <HI>where it is not,</HI> that it has the most direct Tendency to subvert and overthrow it <HI>where it is.</HI> We are station'd, my Brethren, in different Parts of our Lord's Harvest; and we should <HI>study to be quiet, and to do our own Easiness.</HI> We should not so much as have a Mind to crowd our selves into the <HI>Labours of o∣ther Men;</HI> much less should we endeavour to crowd out any of our Fellow Labourers from those Parts of the Harvest which by our common Master, <HI>the Lord of the Harvest,</HI> are assign'd to them. And as we should not aim at this our selves, so neither should we <HI>tamely</HI> submit to it from others, but boldly oppose and stedfastly resist such Criminal Disorders in any of our Fellow Ser∣vants,— But I may not enlarge.</P>
<P>I have thus finish'd what I propos'd; and have shown what Ministers should aim at both with Respect to themselves and their People, <HI>namely,</HI> in one Word, to be <HI>good Men,</HI> and make <HI>them</HI> such; to understand, believe, embrace, and prac∣tice the Religion of Christ, and teach it truly and success∣fully to others. I shall only crave your Patience further, while I make some <HI>Application</HI> of what has been said, in the usual Addresses; <HI>First,</HI> To my Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry, and more particularly to the <HI>Person now to be ordained;</HI> And <HI>then,</HI> to my Christian Hearers in general, but especially those of the <HI>Congregation in this Place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Permit me to address, and make some Application of what has been said to my <HI>Fathers and Brethren in the Mi∣nistry.</HI></P>
<P>How critical is the Situation of our Place, and of what vast Consequence is the right Deportment and due Behaviour of our selves in such important Stations! We are put in Trust with the Gospel of Christ, the richest and most invalu∣able Treasure, and we have this to improve not for our selves only, but for many others. With this in our Hands, with these <HI>Goods of our heavenly Master,</HI> we are to <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>occupy.</HI> And our Business is, not only to improve our selves in the Knowledge and Love of God, and Conformity to his Image and Will, but likewise to gain <HI>others</HI> to Christ, even as many
<PB N="19" REF="005332_0017_10170065553513C0"/>as we can, and to promote in them the same heavenly Vir∣tues. We are not to deal in Party Matters (our Lord will not have his Goods thus bestow'd) in promoting Factions and Schisms, and in dividing and alienating the Minds of Men, and of Christians from one another. We are not to deal in <HI>proud Wrath,</HI> and to spend our Lord's Money in fomenting a better Zeal arising from Men's <HI>doting about Questions and Strifes of Words;</HI> but our Business is, with the <HI>Words of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, and the Doctrine which is according to Godliness,</HI> to promote Faith and Love and that <HI>godly Edifying</HI> which is in Christ Jesus. We are not at Liberty to spend that Time and Strength in contending with our Fellow-Servants, which is given us for other and better Purposes. We have a great Work upon our Hands; and shall we let it <HI>cease while we come down</HI> beneath the Dignity of our Office, to quarrel about Trifles? Let us hear the great <HI>Apostle</HI> giving his solemn Ad∣vice to a Christian Minister, <HI>Follow</HI> (says he) <HI>Righteousness, Faith, Charity, Peace with all them that call on the Lord out of a pure Heart. But foolish and unlearn'd Questions avoid, knowing that they do gender Strifes. And the Servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all Men—in Meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.—</HI> Though we should be firmly resolv'd in the Strength of God's Grace, to profess and stand by the Truth so far as we shall know it, without Re∣gard to the Fear or Favour of Man; yet we should hate Bi∣gotry, and with an equal Zeal avoid whatever has a Ten∣dency to stir up Strife, and to set Christians at Variance one with another. <HI>The End of the Commandment,</HI> says the inspir∣ed St. <HI>Paul, is Charity — from which some having swerved, have turned aside unto vain Jangling.</HI> Though we are set for the Defence of the Gospel, and should contend earnestly for the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints; yet it will not unbecome us to let our <HI>Moderation</HI> be known to all Men; and in Order to the former, we must carefully distinguish what is Gospel and what not, what is the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints, and what has been added to it since by Man. And here let me say, the Credit and Honour of Christianity demand this at our Hands, and the Defence of it makes it absolutely necessary. And I should think the Suc∣cess of it too, might be reasonably hop'd to bear some good Proportion to the Purity and Simplicity in which it is taught.
<PB N="20" REF="005332_0018_101700682E88CFB0"/>To be sure, the Gospel never had such Success as in the pri∣mitive Times before the Face of it was overspread with that great and general Corruption, which even the <HI>Reformation from Popery</HI> (though the greatest of Blessings, yet I fear) has not entirely carried off. It is the <HI>Gospel,</HI> my Fathers and Brethren, our Office was design'd to promote, the Gospel of Christ, and not any human Schemes or Systems. 'Tis <HI>this</HI> we are to teach our People; and for this we should shew our selves becomingly zealous: But if we <HI>teach</HI> them <HI>for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</HI> as we shall not be able to answer it our selves to God, so neither shall we profit our People at all; for the true Fear of God is not to be taught in that Way, Isa. 29.13. and Mat. 15.9. We cannot then be too care∣ful in this Respect, as the Honour and Defence, and Success and Propagation of the Gospel have all so great a Dependance on it, which are the Things we are perpetually to have in our View.</P>
<P>I would now turn my self to the Person, at whose De∣sire and for whose special Service this Discourse was pre∣par'd.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Sir,</HI> I doubt not but you have heard with a particular Self-Application. I have said nothing (I think) discouraging; for why should it be thought an hard Saying, that we must be plain, honest Men, and aim at what we profess to aim at, and serve the Master we profess to have chosen. You will presently be acknowledg'd a Minister of Christ, and receive the Charge of Souls. Your Business then will be, to preach Christ and watch for Souls; no Work more honourable or more important. But in Order to your doing this successfully, <HI>the Life which you live in the Flesh, you must live by the Faith of the Son of God,</HI> depending on, and deriving from him, the Head of all vital Influences, the Assistance you shall need from Time to Time. Oh be not satisfied with meerly preaching Christ, while you shall allow yourself to live a Stranger to him; or with watching for the Souls of others, while you neglect the keeping and the cultivating your own Soul. Preach the Gospel, but live it withal; and know that in so doing you shall be a <HI>Partaker thereof;</HI> you shall more and more ex∣perience the saving happy Influence of Divine Truths; the
<PB N="21" REF="005332_0019_10170069C865D760"/>Doctrine which you preach to others shall continually be of the greatest Advantage to your self, making you an holy and there∣fore an happy Man: And at last you shall partake of the great Reward which the Gospel has set up in the View of its Ministers and Professors to animate them to their Duty with a lively Zeal, even <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> This is enough Sir, we can't need any greater Encouragement: We serve the best of Masters; <HI>his Yoke is easy, and his Burden light,</HI> but the Reward of serving him, <HI>an exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</HI> And if we are call'd at any Time to special and more difficult Trials and Services, <HI>his Strength will be made perfect in our Weakness.</HI> He will not put us upon Impossibili∣ties; he knows we are Flesh, and has had Experience of our Infirmities. If the Sufferings of Christ shall abound in us, so shall likewise those Consolations which are by Christ Jesus. <HI>And as thy Days so shall thy Strength be.</HI> Is not this enough? Is not he faithful who hath promised, and will he not do it? With an entire Dependance then upon these faithful Promises, do thou, my Brother, <HI>do faithfully whatsoever thou dost;</HI> and never let the Fear of Man, or any worldly Consideration, pre∣vail to draw you into Compliances against your Conscience. 'Tis impossible that any outward Thing should be a millionth Part of that Service and Comfort to us, that the Testimony of our Conscience to the Simplicity and Integrity of our Be∣haviour, will be. The Joy of an innocent Mind alone can∣not be equal'd by all earthly Comforts put together; and the more we suffer for Well-doing, or so long as we do well, the greater and more sensible will this be, as well as the future Re∣ward. Let Men then do their worst, the good Man's Happi∣ness is in his own Power, for to be good is to be happy. Let these Things, dear Sir, sink deep in your Heart; and have al∣ways such a Sense of the Happiness of being good, that you may be unwearied and unfainting in your Endeavours to make every Body else so. In this Design, God be with you and make you a prosperous Man.</P>
<P>I am now in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To apply what has been said to my <HI>Christian Hear∣ers in general.</HI> And are you then <HI>Christian Hearers?</HI> This one Word speaks and the Duty I can teach you. You profess yourselves Christians; may God enable you to be such in∣deed!
<PB N="22" REF="005332_0020_1017006BE5A102C8"/>But if you would be so more than in Name or Pro∣fession only, your Knowledge of the Truth must make you free; free from the Power and Dominion of every corrupt Affection and Appetite; you must be sanctified by your Faith which is in Christ Jesus; the Spirit of Christ and of his Gos∣pel must reign and prevail in you. You must be <HI>Partakers of the Gospel;</HI> of the saving, divine Efficacy of Gospel Truths, which shall renew you in the very Spirit of your Minds; purify your Souls, all fill you with the Love of God, and the Love of Goodness. You cannot be Christians without this; <HI>if a Man has not the Spirit of Christ be is none of his.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard the Duty of Ministers: Now you may easily learn your own from thence; for it is in common with the Faithful; that they are to aim at being Partakers of the Gospel; though indeed they should aim at peculiar Mea∣sures thereof. But if common Christians should aim as high as their Ministers, could any Body blame them? If they at∣tain to a Prophet's Goodness, shall they not receive a Prophet's Reward? Be not straitn'd then, my Hearers; be not strait∣ned in your own Minds, for you are not straitned in Christ. The Foutain of Grace is open to you; Oh drink, <HI>drink a∣bundantly,</HI> and be not contented with any low Measures of Goodness.</P>
<P>It is a melancholly Thought, the low Ebb of Christianity in the World: how little is it understood, how little com∣ply'd with? The Name indeed is common, but the Thing how rare! Oh, my Leaness, my Leaness, how just and how general might the Complaint be, among all Orders indeed, a∣mong all Professions, and through al the various Distinctions, that divide Mankind! Let me intreat you, my Christian Friends, not to satisfy your selves with barely being sensible of the Evil, and bewailing it: But up and be doing, and make Proof of what Christians may attain to. The noblest Heights are attainable; arise then, be strong, take hold of God's Strength, and Eternal Life is before you.</P>
<P>I now turn my self particularly to the <HI>dear People of this Parish.</HI> Through the good Hand of God towards you, a Man of Understanding, and as we hope, of sincere Piety, is given
<PB N="23" REF="005332_0021_1017007011C6FEB0"/>you this Day. Oh, magnify the Redeemer for such a Gift. Yet, though we cannot but greatly rejoice with you in the Prospect you have of so happy a Settlement, we must however warn you to <HI>cease from Man whose Breath is in his Nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of? Lord what is Man, Man that is like unto Vanity, and whose Days are as a Shadow that passeth away!</HI> And admonish you, to put your Trust <HI>in the living God, in whose Hand is the Soul of every living Thing, and the Breath of all Mankind;</HI> every Creature being that, and no more as to our Comfort and Happiness in it, than he is pleas'd to make it. Let it be your Care, to do nothing that shall discourage so fervent a Zeal, or cramp such Gifts as your Minister is setting out with. We are Witnesses of the For∣wardness of his Mind towards you, and of his laudable Ambi∣tion to excell. A Thousand Ways you may encourage or discourage him, provoke his Endeavours yet further to serve you, or damp his Spirit, and sink his Mind. I know the Heart of a Minister, the Fears, Temptations and Discouragements, that such are peculiarly incident to; and I know what it is in some good Measure, to have a kind, obliging People; a People that stedfastly adhere to their Minister under all his Troubles, and don't gad about after every Stranger; who know how to bear with their Minister's Infirmities, and are dispos'd to make the best of it, if there be any good Thing in him. I can't but wish, you may be such a People, or a better to him who is this Day to be set over you in the Lord. If you en∣courage him you will certainly reap the Advantage of it your selves. No Man can do under sinking Oppressions, as if a People were kind to him. And if some find Fault (as 'tis impossible it should be otherwise, where there are so many dif∣fering Minds) why may not others commend? I don't mean that it is desireable, there should be differing Sentiments among the same People. So far as it may be, <HI>they should all speak the same Thing, and be perfectly join'd together in the same Mind, and in the same Judgment.</HI> But as this is not to be expected unless we understand it (perhaps as we ought to do) only of an Agreement in Fundamentals; so in other and lesser Matters, there should be a mutual Christian Forbearance one of another. And if every one is not pleas'd in every little Thing, or Mode, or Circumstance of the Minister's Behaviour, or Preaching, or the like, who can help it? What disgusts some, may be edi∣fying
<PB N="24" REF="005332_0022_1017007438ADB078"/>to others: and if some find Fault (I say) others may commend. Not again, that I would have you to flatter your Minister; nothing is more unprofitable, nothing more dange∣rous. But that there may be an <HI>Equality,</HI> and his Spirit not sink under the Captiousness of those, who will never be easy long with any Minister, or under any Preaching. My Chris∣tian Friends, I hope you don't look for Perfection in your Mi∣nister. Let it be his Care to be as perfect as he can, and yours to maintain that Charity whose Property it is to <HI>cover a Multitude of Faults.</HI> Be more concern'd about your own Duty than his; be more concern'd to know your selves how to <HI>live,</HI> than to teach him how to <HI>preach.</HI> And on the other Hand, never satisfy your selves with meerly admiring and ap∣plauding his Preaching. Oh, empty, vain Thing, unprofitable to Minister and People! Commend your Minister's Preaching by improving under it in Knowledge and Virtue, by leading so∣ber, righteous, and godly Lives; this will afford the greatest Sa∣tisfaction both to him and you. Let your Profiting then, as well as his, appear to all Men; and therefore give Attendance to Reading, to Meditation and Prayer in your Families and Closets, as well as to the publick Hearing of the Word; and be much in these Things. Oh, let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly, and aim at being Partakers of the Gospel. Set the Glory and Happiness of the future World continually in your View; live in a realizing sincere Belief and Expectation of the <HI>Judgment to come;</HI> and know, that in Order to your being found in <HI>Christ</HI> in that Day without Spot and blameless, you must here in this World love his Name and be his Ser∣vants; you must study and obey his holy Will; you must sin∣cerely endeavour to find out the Truth for your selves, and live in all good Conscience before God; exercising a daily Repen∣tance for your daily, manifold Infirmities, and a lively continual Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, who loved us and gave himself for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savour:</HI>— To whom therefore, with the Father and Holy Spirit, be given Praises e∣verlasting, Amen.</P>

<HEAD>THE Right Hand of Fellowship By Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> of <HI>Bradford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Brethren of this Assembly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHatever was originally intended by the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP, this Ceremony, as practised in these Chur∣ches, is an Acknowledgment of the Validity of their Ordination to whom it is given, of their Equality as Ministers of the Gospel, and mutual Obligations to assist each other in managing the Concerns and promoting the Interests of Christ their common Lord.</P>
<P>It administers therefore Instruction and Consolation to him that receives it. <HI>On the one hand,</HI> it admonisheth him to mag∣nify his Office and maintain his Equality amongst his Brethren in the Ministry against the injurious Claims of any affecting a Superiority which Christ never gave <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. 20.20, — 28.</NOTE>. And <HI>on the other,</HI> it teacheth him to guard against that Ambition, Covetousness, or whatever else it may be, whereby he may be prompted to exer∣cise a forbidden Dominion over his Equals in the Ministry.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="005332_0027_1017008017234378"/>
And as it succeeds to a Charge the most Important that Man can be intrusted with, and of which an Account must be ren∣dred in <HI>that Day,</HI> when Jesus shall appear in the Glory of the Father with all the holy Angels to judge the quick and the dead, it may be considered as design'd to encourage the Heart and strengthen the Hands of him that receives it, who if he be duely sensible of the Nature of his Office cannot but need it. And this it doth, as it is a Promise of brotherly Love and As∣sistance.</P>
<P>Wherefore, dear Sir, by giving you this Right Hand of Fel∣lowship in the Name of your Brethren in the Ministry, and by the Appointment of the venerable Council convened upon the solemn Occasions of this Day, I acknowledge you to be regular∣ly separated to that Office which I sustain in the Christian Church. And I admonish you that you and I are equal, and that neither of us is upon any Occasion whatsoever, to aspire at that <HI>Dominion</HI> and Authority which Christ hath forbidden us both; no, not yet to suffer it each other.—May God ever∣more grant as much of that humble heavenly Temper of Mind, whereby we may be restrained within the Limits of our Duty, and on the other Hand, that Wisdom and Fortitude by which the Pretensions of every bold Invader of the Rights of his Bre∣thren and Fellow-Servants may be successfully opposed.</P>
<P>And as I am sure the weighty Charge this Day devolved upon you and repeated to me, tends to inspire us with great Fear and Sollicitude of Spirit, let us, my Brother encourage ourselves with the supports Christ hath provided for us which are many and mighty. We are engaged in a Calling that is divine, and are Workers together with God: The holy Spirit, the Sanctifier and the Comforter, operates in us and with us in the same great Undertaking: The holy Angels are oftentimes sent forth up∣on the like weighty Errand of ministring to those who shall be the Heirs of Salvation: Good Men too are with us in our Work by their fervent Prayers, seasonable Counsels, and the persuasive Argument of a good Example: Finally, To those Ministers who shall be faithful to the Death, Christ hath gi∣ven the encouraging Promise of a Crown of Life.</P>

To all which, dear Sir, I add, your Brethren, engaged in the same holy Calling, willingly promise, what in their Turn they expect from you all necessary Assistance by their Prayers, Counsels, Admonitions and Reproofs, and the Exercise of their ministerial Powers.</P>
<P>And now, may God of the Riches of his Grace grant you to acquit your Self in your several Functions with Industry, Fide∣lity and Success, that hereafter you may receive that transport∣ing Sentence from the Judge of all the Earth, <HI>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will make the Ruler own many things, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
