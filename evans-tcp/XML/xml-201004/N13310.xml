<P>AS the present contest between Britain and America must sooner or later come to period, the future harmony of the present belligerant powers, the general good of both Europe and America, and perpetuating peace on each side of the Atlantic, will in all probabi∣lity greatly depend on the footing on which mat∣ters may be put at the treaty of peace; and yet among the various topics repeatedly discussed in the public papers, little or nothing has been said on this head. It certainly cannot be improper to bring the subject into view, and excite the public
<PB N="4" REF="016825_0004_0F9E828C993575F0"/>
attention, to a matter of so great moment, in∣volving in it, not only every individual of the present generation, but the happiness of ages yet unborn. For this purpose, the following thoughts are submitted to public consideration.</P>
<P>First, Respecting territory or dominion. The God of nature, by interposing the vast Atlantic between Europe and America, seems evidently to have pointed out the true natural connection of the one with the other, to be by trade and com∣merce; and to have forbidden both to exercise rule or authority, except on their own side of the ocean. As long, indeed, as any European pow∣er holding possessions in America, treats the in∣habitants so that they find their interest and hap∣piness best secured and promoted by such con∣nection, so long may that connection be expected to continue, and no longer. Whenever this ceases to be the case, that people, if able, will certainly revolt, and set up for themselves; or, if not able, will watch for and embrace the first favourable opportunity of extricating themselves from the yoke. This is a principle in nature; and to ex∣pect the reverse is equally absurd as to expect rivers to turn backward, or the ebbing and flowing of the sea to cease. European sovereignty, therefore, as long as it exists in America, must ever be main∣tained by gentle measures, engaging the affections of the people, and convincing them of their in∣terest in it. The moment the iron sceptre is sub∣stituted in the place of the olive wand, that mo∣ment the connection begins to dissolve; and by continuing to enforce their authority by violence,
<PB N="5" REF="016825_0005_0F9E828D58080210"/>
it is eternally broken. Thus it has been between Britain and the American states; insomuch that were both parties desirous to return to their former connections, it would be in the nature of things impossible for human wisdom to devise a plan, which the mutual jealousies and distrust unavoidable in such a case, would not utterly and inevitably defeat. Were Britain, therefore, to be influenced solely by a regard to her interest, without the least attention to any other motive, she would endea∣vour to settle matters on that plan which is best calculated to restore friendship, and lay a foun∣dation for obtaining advantage by an amicable commercial intercourse; which from the very na∣ture of things cannot be expected in any other channel. But to obtain this, and to settle mat∣ters on a solid basis, she must not only allow the independence of the thirteen states, but must re∣linquish all claims of dominion over the part she yet holds on the continent, especially her northern possessions, and allow them to legislate for, and govern, themselves in the manner they may think best, either in union with the other states, or separate from them. And whatever Britain or others may think of it, and whatever means may be used to prevent it, to this situation matters must and will come, by the natural and necessary course of human affairs, before they rest in a per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> state. The reasons are obvious; her re∣linquishing her claims of dominion over the pos∣sessions she holds, would appear to the people as an act of generosity, and tend to unite them to her commercial interest, more than any restraint or
<PB N="6" REF="016825_0006_0F9E82901AADAA88"/>
force could possibly do, and would at the same time convince the states, that she had laid aside all hostile designs against America: and thus remov∣ing all ground of jealousy and apprehension of danger, would open a door to mutual friendly in∣tercourse; and accomplish by the subtilty of the fox, what she cannot obtain by the force of the lion. Whereas if she resolve to retain them, her fear of losing them, by revolt or otherwise, will necessarily oblige her to a great expence in forti∣fying, keeping up troops, &amp;c. &amp;c. which will probably overbalance all the advantage derived from claiming them as hers; beyond what she might have by a free trade, on the foot of their being their own masters. Her strengthening these places will also naturally alarm the states, and per∣petuate their jealousy of her having still a design to attack them in some quarter, and prevent re∣turn of friendship. It may also disquiet the minds of the people thus retained, as though kept like vassals, when they see the states trade freely to all parts of the world, and themselves confined to Britain; and in process of time produce a revolt; and the fortifications Britain had made be turned against herself: or should a war again break out between her and the other maritime powers, some of them might seize perhaps those retained pos∣sessions, and deprive her intirely of trade to them afterwards; and besides, the consequence of her retaining these possessions will be, either that dif∣ferences and disturbances will rise between those British subjects, and the subjects of the states neighbouring so near together, as in the case from
<PB N="7" REF="016825_0007_0F9E829118135868"/>
which my motto is taken; or they will attempt to set up for themselves and become inde∣pendant; in either of which cases, a war will pro∣bably ensue, and spread the flame through Eu∣rope as well as America; which ought there∣fore to be guarded against, in the most effectual manner, by every power that would wish the pre∣servation of peace. France wisely foresaw the danger, that might arise from such a vicinity of different subjects; and therefore effectually to pre∣vent future differences, interwove in the ground work of the alliance with the states, a quit-claim to act her former possessions in America; and cer∣tainly the danger of differences arising between Britain and the states is far greater, than could in that case have been supposed. In short, if Bri∣tain retains any part of her American possessions, especially to the northward, a peace, whenever made, will not be sheathing the sword, but lay∣ing it by for a season, to be presently employed again, in the horrid scenes of bloodshed, mas∣sacre and war. The case with respect to Spain to the southward is very different; there subsists no animosity or jealousy; and both they and the states, have such a vast scope of yet unexplored country lying behind them, that there is not the least probability of any differences arising between them, from vicinity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE next object of attention is the fisheries by Nova Scotia, the islands adjacent, New-foundland, &amp;c. &amp;c. and here it is to be observed, that as honesty is the best policy, and individuals ever find their true interest in uprightness, and doing to others as they would wish to be done to themselves; it is so also with nations, and their true political interest consists not in making power, but justice and right, the rule of their conduct. The path of policy, when viewed in this point of light, and indeed the only true one, is plain and easy, entirely free from those crooked turnings and windings, as falsly as frequently termed state policy, and which never fails, sooner or later, to lead to destruction, those that walk in them.</P>
<P>On this sure and solid principle alone, I there∣fore proceed to observe, that the God of Nature has wisely ballanced to all parts of the habitable earth, their advantages and disadvantages; and has so ordered matters, that the wants of one nation are supplied by the redundance of those articles in another, and so respectively throughout the whole: For this end, no doubt, to maintain a
<PB N="9" REF="016825_0009_0F9E82929C2D5D18"/>
mutual intercourse and exchange of benefits, among the various parts of the great family of mankind; and thus to form a universal cement, by each contributing to the supply of others, as the members of the body, to the general good of the whole.—What therefore Nova Scotia, Islands, Newfoundland and States adjacent, &amp;c. might want in other respects, it has pleased the great Creator to make up to them in numerous shoals of fish along their coast; as evidently designed in the first instance for their benefit, as the pearl fishery in the gulf of Persia is for that people, or the salt on the coasts of Portugal and the Islands, for the advantage of the inhabitants, or the quails in the wilderness for the children of Israel; and in the second, to furnish them with a staple for trade and intercourse with their brethren of mankind; that they might mutually benefit, and be benefited by one another: and accordingly all nations have ever agreed, that the sea, lying along the coast of a country, with the particular advantages derived from it, as really as the land on which they dwell, belongs to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>On this principle, each European power claims their adjoining sea, and would esteem it an in∣trusion and insult, should any others pretend to claim an equal right. And on this universally confessed principle, when Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1578, made a grant to Sir Humphry Gil∣bert, confirming to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, all the lands he might discover in North America, as far northerly as sixty-eight degrees of north latitude, not already occupied or claimed by any Christian power; the adjoining seas were
<PB N="10" REF="016825_0010_0F9E82935A7C9808"/>
equally granted and confirmed to him as the land; and by virtue of this grant, Newfoundland was settled, and in King James's first and second charters for Virginia, A. D. 1606 and 1600, comprehending the whole country between the latitudes thirty-four and forty-five, from sea to sea, the adjoinining seas, with the islands, fish∣ings, &amp;c. are equally and as expressly granted as the land: and in his third charter, A. D. 1611, this sea extent is particularly mentioned, to the distance of a thousand miles.</P>
<P>The right of European powers, to grant lands they never owned, is not now the question, but it serves to shew the sense of nations on this head; and as a quit claim to America, against any European pretensions to fisheries on their coasts; as whatever claim there was by any European power, Britain had it, and whatever right she had or claimed, she solemnly transferred and confirmed to the inhabitants of the country. From all which it evidently appears, that the fisheries on the coasts of Nova Scotia, and islands belonging thereto, with Newfoundland, &amp;c. &amp;c. properly belong to the people inhabiting the adjacent land, (otherwise the great Creator could have easily ordered the American sinny tribes to the European shoars) and that they cannot in justice be deprived thereof, by the intervention of others, any more than of the land on which they are settled.</P>
<P>If, therefore, matters are allowed to rest on this universally acknowledged and confirmed principle, inhabitants coming from whatever part
<PB N="11" REF="016825_0011_0F9E82941CDF53B0"/>
they may, and settling in the country, will find employment and support by the fisheries, and commerce and a free trade will afford an ample supply to others; and things being thus con∣ducted in a natural easy channel, all future occa∣sion of war or bloodshed from this quarter will be effectually prevented, and a fair and pleasing prospect opened of permanent peace.—Whereas, should any European power engross the fishery, besides the manifest violation of justice towards the inhabitants of the adjacent lands or states, that power would possess such undue advantages over others, not only in the article of fishing, but in a nursery for seamen, to encrease their marine and man their fleets, as to render the safety of their neighbours exceedingly precarious, and per∣petually endanger the peace of both Europe and America. Suppose any one European power to have fifty or sixty thousand men employed in the fishery, as might very readily be, and cer∣tainly soon would be, if engrossed by any one, how easy would it be, for such power to fit out and man a fleet, that would overturn the liberty of both Europe and America, and give law to all the nations around? and still more so, if that nation should possess a great extent of adjacent country, to furnish materials for ship building, &amp;c. whilst on the other hand, if the fishery be carried on by the inhabitants of the adjacent country, to whom it properly belongs, no such danger can be ap∣prehended, as the idea of invading Europe, or attempting to acquire any possessions there, would be too absurd and chimerical, ever to enter the
<PB N="12" REF="016825_0012_0F9E8294D6FAB0C0"/>
minds of a people, at so great a distance. This is a matter so deeply interesting to European powers as well as America, that a regard to their own advantages and safety loudly calls for their most serious attention, and utmost exertions to prevent it.—And to throw the fisheries open to all, would be in effect confirming them to the few, who are already in possession; for their knowlege of the business, and the case with which they could interrupt their neighbours, by only altering the size of their fishing vessels, and thereby dis∣couraging adventurers, would, besides the flagrant injustice mentioned above, be opening a door to frequent debates and quarrels, among the subjects of the different powers, which could not fail to involve them in a war more expensive, than all the advantage they derived from the fishing could compensate. Besides the nations lying most conve∣nient, and having the greatest number of vessels, would, in such case, have a peculiar advantage over those more remote, and whose marine are not so numerous; and might very probably, after a while, entirely exclude them from any share. For a few European nations to divide it among themselves, would be equally unjust, and equally dangerous to the peace and safety of their neighbours, and even to their own peace among themselves. There remains, therefore, no prospect of peace and safety, but in resting the matter on the true principle above; which the interest of both Europe and America, if duly considered, on the large scale of mutual advantage and perpetuated peace, will most certainly lead them to adopt.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016825_0013_0F9E8297D04FCFD0"/>It has been alledged, that the affair of the fishery will be settled by the powers now at war, when a peace comes to be made: but it ought to be considered, that it belongs not to any of them to dispose of them, unless by an act of violence, and confidence in their power to the subversion of justice and right.</P>
<P>Britain, France, and the states, may dispose of their own property as they see meet; but may not in justice meddle with that of others. The fish∣eries on the banks of Nova Scotia, islands adja∣cent, Newfoundland, &amp;c. belong to the inhabi∣tants there, by the grant of the great creator; and the European claim, such as it was, transferred and confirmed them to them. If any alledge, these places belong to Britain, and she may dispose of them as she may think proper; I reply, the char∣ter for Newfoundland (as mentioned above) con∣firms to the inhabitants there a right to both land and sea, not to be revoked or forfeited; and whatever part that people may act, either towards the subjects of Britain or others, all that Britain can do, according to the express declaration of the charter, is to declare them "out of the allegi∣ance and protection of Britain; and to be no lon∣ger avowed, maintained or defended by her;" but may not rob them of their just natural or acquir∣ed rights. And the grant for the settlement of Nova Scotia was <Q>unconditional, absolute, and without any exception or reservation whatsoever; or wheresoever, of all rights royalties, privi∣ledges, franchises, &amp;c. both by sea and land, and likewise the power of goverment, by laws
<PB N="14" REF="016825_0014_0F9E8297DDE73A48"/>
to be made by their own legislatures,</Q> was given for encouraging the settlement of the country, which would have been the true interest of Britain, to have strictly adhered to and fully complied with: and therefore the people consider themselves, equally entitled to their lands and coasts, and to as free a government of their own, from under the controul of any other, as any of the American states; and hope through the blessing of God to maintain it: and hence it is that though their me∣metropolis has been held by the British through the present war; and their strength is not suffici∣ent to free themselves as yet of the imposition, they have notwithstanding taken no active part on that side, but wait for a favorable season of deliver∣ance, and to assert their sovereignty, independent freedom and just rights inseperably connected there∣with. Upon the whole, should peace be established on the above foundation, it will open the fairest prospect of a long uninterupted series of tranqui∣lity to both Europe and America, all ground of disquiet and disturbance being entirely removed. But if matters be unhappily settled on the footing of Britain retaining any part of American pos∣session, especially to the northward, and the fish∣eries to be monopolized by one, or divided among more, or fewer of the European powers, whether the states have a share or not, it must appear evident on a small degree of reflection, the issue must be, in all probability, another war in a short space of time, involving in it the inhabitants on both sides the atlantic, which the true interest of

<P>THE eager desire of most people in America to see peace return, makes the terms, on which it ought to be settled, an object of very great consequence; and unless the subject be better un∣derstood than at present it generally seems to be, we shall have much greater reason to deprecate peace, than a continuation of the war. Peace to America cannot consist in a meer cessation from hostilities, and withdrawing of armies; but on the principles, on which these events may take place, in Europe. Articles of pacification are little else than a resolution to cease from hostilities, until one or other of the parties have recovered from the losses sustained by the war, or recruited their finances. Modern treaties of perpetual frienship
<PB N="16" REF="016825_0016_0F9E82996D15BB98"/>
and peace, scarcely ever exist as long as antient truces, which had no other object but a renewal of the war, after a few years breathing. These kinds of pacification can never answer any valu∣able end to America; the principles on which she ought to make peace, should be such as would secure her from new wars, if she means to be hap∣py, or to enjoy the best advantages of a revolu∣tion. Many will say, what occasion to write on a subject so distant? first shew us that there is a prospect of overtures. To this I reply, that we are at least twelve months behind in information on the subject; and should the terms on which we ought to sheath the sword become the topic of occasional conversation, for the whole time; we should not be too well prepared for entering on the business: and I think the political state of Eu∣rope, make overtures probable by the close of the campaign. The object is large and very exten∣sive, embracing the interests not only of the bel∣ligerent powers, but of every principal state in Europe as well as America. We are young and not over expert in the knowledge of every national concern: all men can see what fate must await us, if we discover as little skill in negociation as in finance, or many other objects of public attention. It is not uncommon, for a nation to recover, by the terms of pacification, as much as she lost by the sword; and tho' the war be unfortunate, the peace may be advantageous. It requires a man to be well acquainted with the circumstances and interests of his own nation, and of those powers with whom he may either formally or eventually be connected,
<PB N="17" REF="016825_0017_0F9E829A90E48620"/>
as well as those of the enemy, to be qualified to assist in a negociation for peace. Whenever that event takes place, if the terms be good and pro∣per for America, she may enjoy perpetual tran∣quility, and be on terms of amity and friendship with every nation, which may visit her coasts, or enter her ports; and it is plain therefore that the pacification must comprehend the general and common interests of all. But if the terms be not such as comprehend all, she stands a very great chance to change enemies; but never to enjoy untroubled security. Dear bought experience has taught us to know, that the scalping knife and tomahawk are equally employed, to butcher our innocent back settlers, while any nation pos∣sesses territory either to the eastward, or in any other quarter, on this side of the Missisippi. Ca∣nada, Nova Scotia, and Louisiana, in the pos∣session of France or Great Britain, are alike hos∣tile to America; and she could never be safe in the neighbourhood of either.</P>
<P>France, whose motives will appear the more just, and measures more generous and disinter∣ested, the more they are examined, has wisely ceded all her claims on these countries. Had she discovered any reluctance on this head, she would have sown the seeds of jealousy and disso∣lution in the very vitals of the treaty of amity, into which she has entered with the American States. By cheerfully relinquishing her claim, she has removed all cause of uneasiness, and de∣stroyed every apprehension of sinister designs, and united them to her for ever: but as much as it is
<PB N="18" REF="016825_0018_0F9E829AF8D32E20"/>
her interest and theirs to be on terms of friendship with each other, so much it is the interest of both, that Britain retain no claim to any part of these countries; and a peace without our inde∣pendence and connexion with them, would only be the cause of new wars, and involve both in the repetition of their present troubles and ex∣pence: for Britain to be our neighbour is to have Britain our enemy. No proverb more true than that, "He who injures, can never forgive," and Britain having once injured, can never forgive America. To live at peace, therefore, with each other, British power must be as far removed from us as her islands are: this therefore, though too little thought of, is a point of the last conse∣quence; but there is one other, perhaps less attended to, which is yet of more importance, and on the right settlement of which, the free∣dom and extension of our commerce will greatly, if not principally, depend; and it is a point, which is equally interesting to every European power, whose subjects either are, or may become mer∣chants, and who wish to feel the enriching in∣fluence of commerce: this is to prevent any European power claiming any share in our fish∣eries, and to guarantee them only to the inhabitants of the adjacent states, to whom they properly belong, as may appear more fully from the pre∣ceding numbers.—Britain usurping it, became mistress of the ocean, and so would any other European power. America possessing it, becomes only an object of a more extensive and lucrative commerce, which must appear evident to every
<PB N="19" REF="016825_0019_0F9E829BA5798950"/>
intelligent person. Every part of America is possessed of a landed staple commodity; excepting that, on the coasts of which, fish are caught in the greatest abundance; to them Nature seems to have allotted this staple, and by means of it to connect them with the distant nations: fixing peace on these principles, America becomes the com∣mon mart of Europe, where every one will find the article he wants, and the purchaser of what he has to dispose of.—But divide it between any foreign powers, in whole, or in part, quarrelling, confusion and animosity will be the unceasing consequence. Possession in common of any pro∣perty, which can be improved and enjoyed, is as impossible among nations, as among individuals. The weaker must always suffer, and the advan∣tages in trade, which the European powers will possess, who do not also possess a full share in the fishery, will be very small, and to divide it a∣mongst all, would be to sow the seeds of conti∣nual contention, and in a great measure to defeat their intentions, in wishing our independence, and often involve us in disagreeable altercations.— They, who have the land, can alone enjoy and improve the fishery to general and equal advan∣tage: Europe will be their market, and Europe will reap the benefits of their traffic; a general circuitous and very profitable trade will be the consequence, and no one power will possess any naval advantage over another. The justness and generosity of the policy of France, in relinquish∣ing all claims to the land, leaves no room to doubt of their acting on the same principles, with
<PB N="20" REF="016825_0020_0F9E829C5BDB5900"/>
regard to the fishery, whenever applied to, on the subject; and the haughty and imperious conduct of Britain to the mercantile and neutral powers of Europe, shews plainly what they are to expect from her, should she continue to derive the sup∣plies of seamen from the fishery, which she has hitherto done.</P>
<P>It is therefore the interest of all Europe to turn their eyes to this object, and to oblige Britain to give up every pretension thereto. On this head, the stipulations ought to be very clear and deci∣sive; and that power alone should possess it, in whose possession it becomes an inexhaustible source of general advantage to all, without proving a bone of contention to any. Let them act wisely, and they will reap plentifully, but neglecting the present opportunity, they will one day feel the folly of their inattention.</P>
<P>I shall conclude by observing to those powers that are in pursuit of imaginary honour, that in a righteous cause, and the just defence of a man's country, all actions of valour are indeed just reasons of praise; but in all other cases, victory and conquest are no more than murder and rapine; and every one is to be detested as the greatest enemy to mankind, that is most active herein. Those are only true heroes, who most benefit the world, by promoting the peace, wel∣fare, and good of mankind: but such as oppress it with the slaughter of men, desolation of coun∣tries, the burning of cities, and the other cala∣mities which attend war, are the scourges of God, and the greatest plagues and calamities that
<PB N="21" REF="016825_0021_0F9E829D29F74170"/>
can happen to it; <HI>and</HI> which are never sent into the world but for the punishment of it; and therefore ought, as such, to be prayed against, and detested by all mankind.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER the great, and Julius Caesar, were two of the most eminent conquerors perhaps to be met with in history, yet their victories and and conquests were so far from being advantages to them, that on the contrary they terminated in their death and ruin, the whole royal families of Philip king of Macedon, and of Alexander the the great his son, were utterly extirpated within the space of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> years; (reckoning from the 334th year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Christ, when Alexander entered upon his exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tion against Darius;) and they, their wives, and all that were descended of them, died violent deaths. Thus these two kings, who by their oppressive and destructive wars had made many tragedies in the families of other prin∣ces, and people, had them all at length, by the just ordination of providence, brought home to their own.</P>
<P>Julius Caesar fought fifty battles without missing of success in any one of them, unless at Pharus, where he swam for his life; and once at Dyrra∣chium, and in these battles he is said to have slain one million one hundred and ninety two thou∣sand men; which proves him to have been the great cut-throat of the age in which he lived. What is the fruit he reaped from these victories? His own blood is shed in the senate, being slain there, even by some whom, he had most highly obliged: and dying childless, his nephew Octavius,

whom he had adopted, swam to the empire also in torrents of blood; and at length left it to the posterity of Authony, whom he had conquered: for none of Octavius's (i. e. Augustus's) posterity ever enjoyed the empire. These bloody men were raised up, in the holy and righteous provi∣dence of God, as scourges in his hand, for the punishment of the wickedness of the age in which they lived; the work was God's; but it being malice, revenge and ambition, that excited them to be the instruments in the execution of it, they justly had for ther reward thereof that destruction by which they fell; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reputed the greatest pests and plagues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> kind. But such is the folly of men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that they usually make the actions of war, bloodshed, and conquest, the subjects of their highest encomiums; and those their most celebrated heroes, that most excel therein.</P>
<P>I shall further add, that neither Britain nor France, can expect to hold any part in America, but by shedding of innocent blood and loss of the affection of the people. Let people therefore from every quarter of Europe, come and settle in America, there can he no cause of complaint when all people of fair moral characters, from every quarter, will meet with equal encourage∣ment. What can Europe have to fear from a num∣ber of their own people? Nor will there be any great danger of any one state, injuring another; as by their several constitutions, such a quick rota∣tion of their officers of government, will prevent their forming plans or schemes, against either

their neighbours or constituents. But should any European powers endeavour to enslave them, and even gain their point; their <HI>victories</HI> would <HI>tend to no other</HI> purpose, than to find them <HI>employ∣ment</HI> by producing <HI>new wars:</HI> for the <HI>business</HI> of every <HI>conquest</HI> is <HI>twofold,</HI>—to <HI>win,</HI> and to <HI>pre∣serve;</HI> and though they might imagine their power to be great, they must <HI>expect</HI> that those they <HI>conquer,</HI> will endeavour to shake off the <HI>yoke</HI> as <HI>fast</HI> as <HI>possible;</HI> for <HI>what people</HI> chuses to be under <HI>foreign dominion?</HI> But should they cease and decline attacki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>hostile</HI> manner with bayonets and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> murdering of mi∣nisters of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the country with scenes of horror <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and woe, they may have our <HI>friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> for it is in vain that <HI>confi∣dence</HI> is reposed in a <HI>conquered</HI> people: there can be no <HI>sincere friendship</HI> between the <HI>oppressors</HI> and the <HI>oppressed.</HI> Even in <HI>peace,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> think themselves <HI>entitled</HI> to the <HI>rights</HI> of <HI>war</HI> against the <HI>former.</HI></P>
<P>Your true interest, therefore, appears to be only trade and commerce, which can be no other way obtained, but by gaining the good will of the people. By that means millions, may be made annually, which will be vain to expect from any other plan of murder and shedding of inno∣cent blood. We will therefore, if you please, enter into a treaty with you, and with all man∣kind, of lasting friendship.</P>
<P>The many and great advantages in trade and commerce, which European powers in general, and the maritime in particular, will derive from
<PB N="24" REF="016825_0024_0F9E82A28612A060"/>
their adopting such a plan, are very obvious; which, with the disadvantages that will unavoid∣ably attend a contrary conduct, shall be the subject of some subsequent numbers.</P>
<P><HI>Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee. That I will not pass over to thee, and that thou-shall not pass over unto me for harm,</HI> Genesis xxxi. 44, 52.</P>
