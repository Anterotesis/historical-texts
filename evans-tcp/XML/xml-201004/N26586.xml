<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>The unfriendly reports that have been industri∣ously circulated, by certain malevolent characters, respecting a settlement lately established at the mouth of Cumberland on the Ohio river: and the late military abuses, offered to my friends and self, on our late route down the Mississippi, has induced me to submit the following pages to the impartial circle of my fellow citizens: and to my friends in particular: As a justice due them: and as a duty I owe myself, it becomes me now to declare most so∣lemnly, that no part of my proceedings, negociati∣ons, or correspondance, has ever been intended, or designed, directly or indirectly, to be immicalto my country: the constitution or laws of it: to prove this my assertion: should it be neces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary: hundr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of citizens equally as respectable as any in the west∣ern country will appear, who have been, and still are, intimately acquainted with my intentions, and objects.</P>
<P>I further defy any man, or men on earth with truth to say that any part of my transactions, nego∣ciations, or correspondance, ever was, or can possi∣bly with propriety, be construed inimical to the true interest of my country; the constitution or laws of it: but to the contrary, as much as any man on earth, I have ever respected &amp; reverenced them. If upon impartial investigation I am wrong (it is not wilful) I wish to be convinced of it: if in the right, a legal remedy, so as to prevent a future evil of the same nature: is all I ask: I am content to bear my losses with fortitude: it is beyond human reach to repair the injury.</P>

<P>AN ESTIMATE of commercial advantages, by way of the Mississippi and Mobile; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto various parts of Western North America. From a Pamphlet published by the auther at Knoxville, in the year 1797; No XV, Page 98, corrected from late observation, and experience.</P>
<P>The Mobile Bay, is situate between the latitude of 30 degrees 20 minutes and 31 d. 10 m North; and between the longitude of 87 degrees 35 mi∣nutes, and 87 degrees 55 minutes West from the meridian of London; it makes an excellent and safe harbour; the inlet is formed by Dauphin Island on the west—and a peninsula, or point of land extending from the main on the east;— through which may be carried three fathom water into the Bay.</P>
<P>Into this Bay falls Tombigby River, descending from N. N. W. and Allabamma River descending from N E. and although intersected with Islands, sea vessels can pass up the former to latitude 31 deg. 30 minutes, being the North point of the flowing tide. Into Tombigby falls Sipseys River, descending from N N. <HI>E.</HI> which as well as Tom∣bigby, is navigable for boats of fifty tons burthen, as high as the latitude of 33 deg. 45 min. from the two last points to the main river Tennessee, is a∣bout fifty five miles, and to the nearest navigable branches of Tennessee (extending from the lower and upper end of the Muscle Shoals) about thirty∣five miles: the country between the two points is level and well calculated for carriage.</P>
<P>From the head of Mobile Bay to the head navi∣gation of Tombigby and Sipseys river is about three hundred miles by water. A boat of twenty-five tons burthen, can pass and repass in thirty days

<P>In favor of Mobile commerce, on the carriage of 25 tons weight, to Pittsburgh; against the Philadelphia commerce 1,420 dolls.</P>
<P>Expence on 25 tons weight, from the mouth of Mississippi, to Pittsburgh and back again, as per letter V and T 3,200 dollars: one half for the total expence to Pittsburgh 1,600 dolls.</P>
<P>In favor of the Mississippi commerce on the carriage of every 25 tons weight against the Philadelphia commerce, to Pittsburgh. 900 dollars.</P>
<P>In this calculation, I have estimated the carri∣age from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, at 5 dollars per hundred weight—but the general price has been from seven to ten dollars per hundred wt. which would be against the pittsburgh commerce; greatly in favor of the Mississippi and Mobile— consequently all the Western country, South of Pittsburgh, must receive great advantages by the Mississippi—and particularly Mobile commerce.</P>
<P>The objection by mariners to commer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al inter∣course with New Orleans, has been generally at∣tributed, to the intricate navigation of their v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="11" REF="035360_0011_10049F571F092120"/>Mississippi—but from late observation, I can ven∣ture to assert, that those obstacles will be readily removed—by an accurate knowledge of the river, and particular seasons, calculated by nature for na∣vigating of it.</P>
<P>From about the first of April, until the first of July—the river Mississippi, overflows its banks, which renders the navigation of sea vessels up to New Orleans very intricate—but in all other seasons of the year, the current below Orlean is gentle—and what will ever facilitate the ascent of the river, are the continual South and Southeasterly winds which prevails, during the Spring, summer, and autumn months; extending their influence, considerably above the junction of Ohio and Mississippi.</P>
<P>The annual imports, and expor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; to Washington or Ham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lton District, State of Tennessee—from the best information I have been able to collect; are a∣bout 250 tons: to Mero District, State of Tennessee, about 200 tons: and to Kentucky, about 750 tons; consequently the annual revenue, to the Western country would be; From the Mobile commerce.</P>

<P>All Western America, in the United States, South of latitude 41 degrees North—would in pro∣portion, receive similar advantages, with these a∣bove stated—independant of what, would natural∣ly resuit, from the great object of exportation—which must be highly productive to any country, possessing the advantages, of such immense sources of wealth, as are here found.</P>
<P>It is certain for many years, the exports will pass down the river Mississippi—but the imports, if the avenue was admitted to be opened, would now pass by way of Mobile and Tennessee—and the various streams with which the latter communicates.</P>
<P>From correct information I am induced to believe that with but little expence, the communication, between the navigable waters of Mobile and Ten∣nessee, may be shortened, at least 10, perhaps 15 miles: consequently it cannot be improbable that the day will be, when the commerce of far greater part of Western America—North of the junction of Ohio and Mississippi, will concentre to this grand mart, formed by nature.</P>
<P>To me it appears strange, that any government should deem it good policy, to withhold from a part of her citizens, the use of streams formed for their benefit; while the nations having claims on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> borders, remain unopposed to its exercise.</P>
<P>I he opening this avenue of commerce, could not be injurious to the natives; but on the con∣trary
<PB N="13" REF="035360_0013_10049F5DB356F990"/>they would be highly benefitted, and might soon be taught to feel, the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y advantages result∣ing to them from the measure; he doubly reward∣ed in the labour of their industry—increase in wealth—and grow into the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of order.</P>
<P>Early as the year 1785, on my route through this Western country; I was struck with the practicability of a Commercial Communication, by way of the Mobile and Tennessee, as well as the Mississippi—these objects, together with a desire of settling in a country, calculated as well to insure agricultural ad∣ventages, as great commercial pursuits; has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en the spur of my exertions to obtain the lands, adjacent the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> probable points, of commercial communi∣cation; to facilitate the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cre on legal and pub∣lic principles; the following plan has been sug∣gested, and entered into by sundry citizens: which was enclosed to his Excellency John Sevier <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the 31st of August, 1797, in answer to his inter∣rogatory letter to me, the 20th of said month:—from a Pamphlet published at Knoxville.

<P>On my way through the state of Kentucky in January 1798, when at Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kfort; I commumcated to his Excellency James Garrard <ABBR>Esqr.</ABBR> Govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d state; my intention to settle and fix a com∣mercial establishment at or near the mouth of Cum∣berland river above the Indian boundary soliciting his friendly advice on the subject: and at the same time offering every assurance that no part of my conduct, or of those who might unite with me in the settlement, should be derogatory to the laws of that state or the United states, I received the fol∣lowing verbal answer from his Excellency.</P>
<P><Q>That unfavourable reports had circulated with respect to my intended settlement, he was glad to be informed of the truth, and would render every assistance in his power to the rising settlement consistant with the duties of his office.</Q></P>
<P>On the 10th of February ensuing I embarked from the falls of Ohio, and on the 18th instant ar∣rived at the destined place of settlement.</P>
<P>I pitched on the spot best calculated for the com∣mercial establishment contemplated at the distance of about two miles below the mouth of Cumber∣land
<PB N="21" REF="035360_0021_10049F7528632838"/>river, I immediately dispatched a messenger to Captain Pike, commander a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fort Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>form∣ing him the object I had in view, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting his ap∣probation to the measure, and friendly and in the new establishment.</P>
<P>On the arrival of the messenger and men who accompanied him, at Massac, they fell in company with captain Thomas Lewis, who (by military pow∣er) co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red the messenger part of two days:—he being at length set at liberty, without knowing the charges against him (as he told me) returned on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st. with the following verbal information:</P>
<P>Capt. Pike conceived the spot I had pitched up∣on not to be Indian lands; I was auther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed and could settle there with propriety, and he should always be harpy to render me any services in his power consistant with his office.</P>
<P>I immediately Lotted off the ground, the fami. lies and men began their improvements</P>
<P>On the 22d inst. I set out for Cumberland settle∣ments (at the distance of about 90 mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) from whence I retured to the mouth of Cumberland, on the 10th of March ensuing; with a small cargo of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es to aid the rising settlement, which we named <HI>Smithland.</HI></P>
<P>On my return from Cumberland, our number consisted of about ten families, and thirty-three men. Capt. Wm. L. Cox, who arrived in my absence, from Frankfort, in company with several emigrants, had (with the assistance of the settlers) erected a block house for defence, on account of the hostile appearance of the Indians; who six days previous came in a formidable party, and ab∣solutely ordered the settlers all to quit their pos∣sessions in ten days, or they would (as they express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="22" REF="035360_0022_10049984B4D03BB0"/>themselves) take hair. Capt. Wm. L. Cox imme∣diately wrote Capt Pike on the subject, soliciting his friendly advice and aid.</P>
<P>About the middle of March, Capt Pike with a military escort, made us a visit; fifteen or twenty Indians attended on the occasion, after viewing the ground and situation of the country—finding us not on the Indian lands, the Captain used his in fluence to satisfy their mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds with respect to our settlement.</P>
<P>The indians still continued to hover around us with marks of hostility, collecting in number to the amount of about three hundred, well at med; fore of them encamped West of the river On<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, and others South of the river Tennessee, their spies and reconnoitring parties, twice every day, passed through our sett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement on their route from one camp to the other. Some of our emigrants lest the settlement; others expressed alarm, and disposi∣tion to depart, whom I encouraged and prevailed upon to continue; by informing them my hopes of the arrival of Captain J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn Smith from Holst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in with a large boat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aded with provisions, mecham∣cal and farming utensi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and supplies for defence.</P>
<P>Soon after I received information from Captain John Smith, that the government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad denied him the privilege of descending the river Tennessee, with the boat and supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or what cause he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll, but nothing soon could be expected from that quarter; as he was obliged to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the pleasure of government.</P>
<P>Thus our infant settlement was left without provisions or supplies for defence; our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er consisted of about forty-five women and chil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ren, and about fifty men; the Indians still shewing a

<P>The information I received some weeks past which will be shewn you per. Majr. Gist the bearer of this appears to me not more extraordinary than that of your order to me of this day, to ascend the river beyond the distance of a six pounder; however I have thought proper to obey your orders, as it is now and ever was my real desire, to conform to the rules and regulations of any constituted authority derived from our government.</P>
<P>The emigration to Smithland has far surpassed the calculation of many; provision being scarce necessity has measurably inforced us to draw some assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance from the wood. The laws of the United States have prescribed the boundary between us and the Indians over which we cannot pass with∣out offence, though the Indians have been pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mit∣ted to take the game from us.</P>

<P>After my compliments to your honour, I take the liberty to inform you, that on the 16th day of this inst. at the request of Col Cox, and four cap∣tains, in your Regiment from Smithland, I droped down in a perogue to fort Massac, and made a can∣did statement of their intended route down the ri∣ver, offering any security for a proper conduct.
<PB N="29" REF="035360_0029_10049F8A49A77368"/>Major Kingsberry told me that Col. Cox could pass on his negoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations with a few men, but unarmed, the next morning we droped down near the gar∣rison, I were forward:—told the Maj. that Col. Cox had arrived near his garrison, wished him to come to his boats, or nominate some officer to do so, view his situation and boats, pass as many as he pleased, and in what manner he pleased, and the balance would return.</P>
<P>His answer was, that we must return immediate∣ly out of the reach of the shot of a six pounder, or from an order he should fire on us, which Col. Cox and the officers on my return thought proper to comply with; the other documents will be enclosed in the colonel's letter.</P>

<SALUTE>Col. Moses Shelby, Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>On my route down the river Ohio, in pursuit of the journey contemplated and fully communi∣tated to you when at Smithland—there appears some difficulty with the officers of the garrison Mas∣sac, in permitting our descending the river as you will see per the inclosed documents. I have tho't it my duty to communicate you the circumstances, soliciting your friendly advice as commander of the county, on a subject truly interesting to all the citizens of this Western world.</P>
<P>If the free and independent navigation of those Western w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters are to be thus invaded, there is no longer use for civil authority; but all must bend to a military prerogative.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="035360_0030_10049F8D15AC2438"/>
I have ever supported the civil authority of my country and still hope to have it in my power to do so; you are the only officer present on whom I can call or look up to fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> justice; therefore hope you will do myself and friends the honor of your presence, that a proper and legal investigation of the subject may take place.</P>

<P>Several others; offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of Col. Shelby's Pegt, also wrote him soliciting his advice on the occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion.</P>
<P>On the 19 th of July 1798.</P>
<P>Myself and company ascended the river Ohio to South Smichland.</P>
<P>On the 20th of July</P>
<P>Col. moses shelby, in company with J. Ramsey <ABBR>Esqr</ABBR> (one of the civil officers of Christian County) arrived at South Smithland, I fully communicated to them the circumstance of myself and friends be∣ing stopped from descending the river Ohio.</P>
<P>Colo. Moses Shelby J. Ramsey <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> accompanied by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jor Thos, Gist, and several other citizens of Smithland, thought advisable to wait on the com∣mander at Massac; in order if possible to know the cause why citizens were prohibited from descending the river.</P>
<P>On Col. Shelby's arrival at Massac (as himself and J. Ramsey, on their return informed me) he asked Major Kingsberry the cause that influenced him to prevent the citizens of Kentucky from de∣scending the river Ohio, and whether he [Kings∣berry] had any charges or partial orders against myself and company?—answer—That he [Kings∣berry]
<PB N="31" REF="035360_0031_10049F8EADB64158"/>had orders, not to admit armed men to descend the river Ohio.</P>
<P>Col. Shelby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sked Major Kingsberry for a sight of the foregoing order; which was denied him; on his return from Massac he (Col. Shelby) wrote the following letter. v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<SALUTE>Major Kingberry SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since my departure from your Garri∣son, on mature consideration as a citizen of Ken∣tucky; considering the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uation of my fellow citi∣zens, who have been orderly and good men; and organized in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny regiment by their own request, it causes my feelings to bleed. But as an officer en∣quiring into these grievancies, being denied a sight or a copy of your orders, in a case so interesting to my fellow citizens and myself (as the uninterrupted navigation of the river Ohio provided for and se∣cured to us by treaties with all nations touching thereon) causes me to think myself injured.</P>
<P>I now beg you if cosistant with your power and order; to admit the barge of Col. COX, and one flat boat with five perogues, to pass with five men aboard of each, or I suppose five less might do by getting hirelings to work up, I have thought from the date of your order, corresponding with the date of the letter that major Gist gave you a copy of a few days ago; they must in my opinion originate with, and come from col. Hamtrammock; if not I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope you will on the reception of this give me a true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opy in order to enable me to inform my fellow ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izens, that for the future they may not depend up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> treaties or civil authority; but resign all to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ary prerogative, and to attempt any thing to

<P>Myself and company proceeded on our journey some distance below Massac (in the county of Chri∣stian State of Kentucky) we were joined by capt. Samuel Hancock &amp; company.</P>
<P>On the 23d of July captain Hancock in company with several others who passed by land with him, ascended the river Ohio to Massac; for the purpose of bringing on some provisions we had previously<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Captain Hancock on his return to Massac con∣versed with the officers on the subject of his passing by land who knew himself and men to be of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> company.</NOTE>

<P>The 24th. of July 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8 we proceeded on our journey &amp; arrived at <HI>New</HI> Madrid on the 26th inst, we sent a messenger in advance, with information to the commander, of our desire to descend the ri∣ver by his Garrison; we received the following verbal answer viz</P>
<P>That the navigation of the river Mississippi was free for all americans to pass when they pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amolested.</P>
<P>On our arrival at New Madrid I immediately wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted on the commander and informed him the objects we had in view.</P>
<P>The commander informed me that he could not authorise myself and company to explore or settle in his catholic Majesty's Dominions, as that power was only vested in his supe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors, the Governor Ge∣neral of the province of Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iana would probably authorise the object we had in view, to whom he re∣commended me, he further observed that we could with propriety descend the river the navigation be∣ing free, but gave it as his advice for myself in com∣pany with a few men first to descend the river, see the Governor General and know his sentiments.</P>
<P>I returned to the company who descended the river with me, and informed them as near as I could, the conversation that passed between the commander and myself, on deliberation it appeared to be the general opinion of the company to adopt the advice of the commander; and accordingly all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turned except myself and thirteen others, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom I descended the river Mississippi.</P>
<P>On the 11th day of August 1798, myself and

<P>I was immediately on my arrival at Natchez, in∣formed by several citizens, that the federal officers had in contemplation, by military power, to confine myself and company.</P>
<P>we continued at Natchez several days, in peace and harmony with our friends.</P>
<P>On the 18th instant, about the hour of twelve o'clock at night, my lodging was surrounded with probably some few less than a battalion of federal troops, with fixed bayonets. A Mr. Scott, and a Mr Grag came into the house, and without ceremo∣ny forced the room, where I was in bed with Capt. Wm. L.

<P>I asked their authority, they told me it was from Governor Sergeant. I put on my clothes, they for∣ced me at the point of the bayonet to fort Panmuir of Natchez; (as they call it) I demanded their autho¦rity—Mr. Grag shewed me orders to the following effect—viz.</P>

<P>Will you permit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to send an open power of attorney to some friend to negociate and settle my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ate business, this request was denied me.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty I was permitted to keep copies of my letters wrote the Governor and Judge. Capt George Demler observing that my publishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them might some day bring upon him trouble; capt. Demler as he told me waited on c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Ham∣trammock on this occasion, whom he said had no rejections, to my keeping copies of such letters as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> approved of by the officers, and that all letters
<PB N="42" REF="035360_0042_10049FB14196AD60"/>written by me must positively be done in his pre∣sence. Some few days previous to my departure from confinement I was informed by a friend (who accidentally got an opportunity to speak with me) that every measure possible was then pursuing, by General Wilkinson, and the Federal officers, to involve me in inevitable ruin. The most ungerous reflections and unfavourable representations were made to those who were unacquainted with us; in fact no abuse with them was too nefarious to be prescribed, and that if I respected myself or friends he advised me if possible to depart.</P>
<P>Under those impressions I determined at every risque to leave my confinement.</P>
<P>On the 25th. of Sept. I told the officers of the Fort in the care of whom I was placed; that I would rather not exist than to be unjustly and ille∣gally confined, my friends would be injured, who had reposed implicit confidence in me; and I must be involved in inevitable ruin; provided I was de∣tained from pursuing my lawfull business.</P>
<P>All I asked was that justice the constitution and laws of my country entitled me to, and rather than be denied that, I would cease to exist in this world.</P>
<P>Except some few contemptuous grins, the officers made little or no reply to my observations and pro∣bably thought less of them.</P>
<P>On the 26th of September 1798 (with consider∣able risque) I departed from Fort Panmeur of Natchez, on my way at the distance of fifteen leagues from New Orleans, I met a report that myself with a considerable number of men was on the way to plunder and harrass the Spanish settlers; and on my arrival at New Orleans, on the 3d. of October 1798. I was informed of the fact, that a
<PB N="43" REF="035360_0043_10049FB2D7A14548"/>letter from General Wilkinson had arrived some few days previous, the contents of which will ap∣pear in the following orders, published by the Go∣vernor general of the Province of Louisiana viz. I have just now received an unquestionable proof of the faith of the U. S. in the observance of the treaty by which the interest of our nations are so happi∣ly united.</P>
<P>General Wilkinson informs me that a very large number of people without law or any nation all consideration have joined in the western part of the U. S. with the perverse design of invading this province, and no other object than that of plundering its inhabitants and committing such excesses as may be expected from men with∣out any discipline, whose existance is only suppor∣ted as long as their atrocities keep them out of the reach of deserved punishment.</P>
<P>The chief of those banditti has under various pretexts deceived the commander of Fort Massac and was permitted to pass with a small party of his people, having pursuaded him that they were going to hunting; but the main body went through the woods out of sight of the Fort to embark about a league further; said General sup∣poses that these may be a part of the forces with which Blount intended to invade this province.</P>
<P>He has given me this timely information to the end that I might take such measures as can prevent so eminant a danger; the executive power of the U. S. has been long pursuing that party of outlaw∣ed people so far as to send troops against them.</P>
<P>The chief of those vagabonds has been lately ar∣rested in Natchez and I make no doubt but what the vigilence of that Government will continue to
<PB N="44" REF="035360_0044_10049FB71E25A2D8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>op the progress of those malefactors.</P>
<P>Although the measures which the government of the U. S. employs to that purpose be efficacious I should be reproachable of negligence should I not do my endeavours to preserve the tranquility of this province and assure to its inhabitants their lives honor and property the principal objects on which is established the happiness of society, and which is the aim of the most beneficent Goverment.</P>
<P>On seeing so eminent a danger I have taken the most convenient measures to have stores of provisi∣ons, and amumtion at Batton Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, where in case of necessity I intend to assemble the principal forces of this province with a camp of observation at pointe Coupee, Col.

<P>To the end that the said junction may be effect∣ed with all possible speed, you will give the conve∣nient orders to the mixed legion of the Mississippi to march at the first warning</P>
<P>In all times the militia of this province have gi∣ven the most convincing proofs of their fidelity bravery and patriotism not only preserving, their own tranquility, but also crowning themselves with Glory and adding lau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els to the arms of his Majesty; this fills me with the most flattering hopes, and makes me beforehand confident of success.</P>
<P>The zeal activity and skill which you have shown

<P>To send your orders, you will employ as cou∣riers, such men as you'll think more apt for that purpose, and they will be paid out of the Royal Treasury, as well as other extraordinary expences w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en may arise from the marching of the region.</P>

My arrival at New-Orlean the moment I did, gave no small degree of surprise to the citizens, as well as the Spanish officers—and as to my own part I can only leave to my friends and fellow citizens to judge of the unpleasant situation in which I was placed: a lone stranger, supported only by a cons∣cious rectitude of my actions, and the profound jus∣tice of the Spanish officers who are disposed to be in amity with the United States, and to treat her citizens with justice and respect.</P>
<P>On my arrival at New Orlean, I immediately waited on his excellency governor Gayoso, to whom I stated candidly my situation, and the object I had in view for making him a visit.—,—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The impartial can justly figure to themselves, the estonishment with which I was received, and my embarrasment when the unfavorable represen∣tations which had been officially communicated, was pronounced to me; howeve truth as in all cases here, had its influence.</NOTE> I was treated politely; and am happy to have it in my power, to inform the world and my friends par∣ticularly; that in his excellency Manuel Gayoso De-lemos, I have had the pleasure to find every principle that constitutes the officer of justice, gen∣tleman of honour, humanity and benevolence.</P>

<P>Some short time after my arrival at New Or∣leans, Wilkinson, or Sergeant, perhaps both of them, demanded of governor Gayoso the person of Zachr.

<P>After accomplishing my business much to my sa∣tisfaction with his excellency Governor Gayoso; by his approbation I departed from New Orlean, on the 30th of October for the United States, by way of Mobile, where I arrived in company with Mr. Amos Edwards, on the 8th of November 1798; by the citizens, officers and commander of Mobile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were politely treated.</P>

Situated as I was, the impartial reader may figure to himself my embarrassment, in the midst of an in∣dian nation; having no other way to pass into the United States, but through a tribe of savages— whose enmity, and prejudices, was now roused to extreme against my friends and myself.</P>
<P>And they employed by a reward to arbitrarily and illegally molest me, at a time and place, where Mr. Amos Edwards and myself stood des∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tute of either friends or acquaintanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; except two or three humane citizens of the Indian co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry, and Samuel Mitchel <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who in every respect con∣ducted himself as an officer of justice and a gentle∣man of integrity.</P>
<P>For some time past false representations have been industriously circulated; as well amongst the several tribes of Indians, as with the citizens of the United States—that myself and friends intend∣ed to settle the Indian lands at the Muscle Shoals in a forceable manner.</P>
<P>Those erronious prejudices have been kept alive by the detention of a boat [built on Holstein] un∣der impressions that said bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was intended to con∣vey emigrants to the Muscle Shoals contrary to the approbation of government. Any security would have been given which was repeatedly proposed by myself and friends—that the said boat should not be improperly or illegally employed Notwith∣standing, every legal effort made use of by myself and friends (to our extreme injury) the boat was detained—which if she had been admitted, would have passed to Smithland; from thence to New Orleans, and proved to the Indi∣dians. and to the world at large, that these circula∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng reports were as false as the previous commu∣nication
<PB N="50" REF="035360_0050_10049FC8A19FFC88"/>to the Spanish off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs. Let me ask Maj.

<P>By false representations the Spanish subjects, as well as the several tribes of Indians, were now routed to the highest prejudice against me. Had I acceded to Kingsberry's prescription, by the for∣mer I must have been treated contemptuously, if not harshly—and to the latter I must have fallen a Iacrasice, as several armed parties visited us on our route; Kingsberry well knew the savages had but a few weeks previous, plundered a boat and crew, on the Oh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o river, but a small distance below Mas. Iac.</P>
<P>I had every reason to believe, previous to my departure from Smithland, false representations had been made.</P>
<P>But going to New Madrid in company with 80 men, and conducting ourselves in a legal and pro∣per manner;—convinced that wise and just administration, the purity of our intentions; and at once destroyed all confidence in malevolent com∣munications.</P>

On Sunday evening about 8 o'clock, by virtue of the previous warrant and affidavit of W. P.

<P>We whose names are hereunto subscribed, do certify, that we were present at the examination of lieut. W. P. Smith. in his testimony against Zachariah Cox, before the hon. Judge M'Nairy— at which time, in addition to what appears in the affidavit from under his hand; the following infor∣mation was given by him on oath, as we conceived; also, the following questions asked, and answers given, viz.</P>
<P>Mr. Cox having observed that he conceived the treatment he had met with there was arbitrary— Mr. Smith addressed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself to the Judge, and said that he conceived Mr. Cox had been arbitrarily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated there—meaning at the Natche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P N="1">1st Question by Judge M'Nairy.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith, how do you mean arbitrarily?</P>
<P>Answer. <HI>It</HI> appeared so to me.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Question by Judge M'Nairy.</P>
<P>In what manner do you conceive Mr. Cox was treated arbitrarily?</P>
<P>Answer—Because he was kept in confinement so long without having his charges made known to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and refused a hearing, and liberty of giving b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, when offered as good as any in the country, and he thought by the laws of the country Mr Cox, has entitled to it, or words to that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>port.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Question, by Mr. Z. Cox's council.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035360_0056_10049FDB404FA2B8"/>
Do you of your own knowledge, know of any charge of a criminal nature against Mr Cox?</P>
<P>Answer—He knew nothing of a public nature, but that he was informed Mr. Cox, and the settlers, had formed a committee, and had expelled a fami∣ly from his settlement, and sent them to the Spa∣nish government.</P>
<P>Zachariah Cox then observed—that he had al∣ways endeavored to support good order, and had quarreled with some imprudent persons for speak∣ing disrespectfully of government; and that in new settlements some bad men would be found— upon which</P>
<P>Mr. Smith arose from his seat, and addressing himself to Judge M'Nairy, said; that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t would be of any service to Mr Cox. that he would fur∣ther observe, that during Mr. Cox's residence at Smithland, there was frequent intercourse between him and the officers at Massac, and the most per∣fect harmony subsisted between them; and that he had frequently heard of Mr. Cox's checking of men for speaking disrespectfully of government, and par∣ticularly knew he had differed with one Mitchell on that subject, and threatened to drive him away for his abuse of government.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Question, by Zachariah Cox.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith, was not the Chickasaw Indians em∣ployed to apprehend me.</P>
<P>Answer, by Mr Smith:</P>
<P>Yes, I am informed they were, and that general Wilkinson had offered them a reward of three hun∣dred dollars; and I believe there is still a reward in the Natchez and Chickasaw nation to apprehend you.</P>
<P>The above is the purport, and nearly the words

Gregg shewed me his orders for apprehending Cox and for commiting him to me to be put into confinement—Lieut. Pope was officer of the day and I directed him to go and have the Block house immediately prepared for the recepti∣on of Cox, which was immediately done and Cox confined in it.</P>
<P>My orders to the officer of the day respecting Cox were that no body should see him or have any communications with him except the officer of the day, who was always to examine the prisoners pro∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns or clothes that were sent to him from Mrs. M'K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bs previous to sending them to the Block∣house which was always done in presence of the of∣ficer of the day—Cox was kept in this manner a bout ten days, when his health began to impair and upon the recommendation of the Doctors app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icati∣on was made, and permission granted by Governor Sergeant to allow Cox to walk in the Fort u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der the inspection of a commissioned officer which to the best of my knowledge was duly and faithfully exe∣cuted by the respective officers of the day, or in their absence by me.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. by the Court; who was officer of the day when Cox made his escape.</P>
<P>Ans. Lieutenant Pope.</P>
<P>Quest. 2d where was lieutenant Pope when Cox made his escape.</P>
<P>Ans. from Mr. Popes own information and that of lieutenant C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uppell, he was in the Fort.</P>
<P>Quest. 3d. In what manner did Cox escape.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="035360_0059_10049FE3B2D93E10"/>
Answer On the 26th Mr. Pope came to the cols. to pay h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s respects to the General and was there a bout half an hour as he was going away I called hun aside and told him I understood by some officers that cox's settlement was broken up, and that seve∣ral of his party was coming down in publick em∣ploy with the fleet—and begged him to pay parti∣cular attention to Cox on that day; Mr. Pope pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ied to do so, and went away, as I supposed to the Fort—I remained and dined with the General at the colonels—between seven and eight O'clock in the evening lieut. campbell came to capt Hiths quarters, and informed me that cox had made his escape, I immediately reported it to Capt. Hith, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en senior officer; col. Hamtramck and capt. Gui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> having gone with the General to his boats— captain Hith immediately reported the circumstance to the colonel.</P>
<P>Quest 4th. Was Cox at large during the night in custody of the officer of the day, or was he closely confined.</P>
<P>Ans He was closely confined in the upper part of the block house, and not allowed the privilege of candle—a trap door seperated him from 6 or 7 horse thieves, who was confined below.</P>
<P>Quest 5th. at what time was Cox usually re∣turned to close confinement in the block house.</P>
<P>Ans. Generally between 7 and 8 o'clock, some∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes earlier and sometimes later in the evening, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not suffered to go out of his sight.</P>
<P>Ques<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6th. Had Cox any communication with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one by letter or otherwise during his con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ement,</P>
<P>Ans Yes, but always in presence of officers—he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e one letter to governor Sergeant, and ano∣ther
<PB N="60" REF="035360_0060_10049FE827A4C9D8"/>to judge Bruin in my presence. That for governor sergeant was given to col Hamtramck, and that for the judge was delivered by me to him —I know of no other, except a small note writ∣ten to his cousin, recommending some particular kind of medicine, he being sick.</P>
<P>6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Did he ever receive any letter while in confinement, if so, in what manner &amp; from whom.</P>
<P>Ans. Yes, he received one from his relation which was in the first instance sent to the govern. or, then to col. Hamtramck, and delivered to Cox by me: it was read in my presence, and after wards returned by me to the colonel (as I believe) he was denied the use of paper pen and ink during his confinement—<HI>I</HI> requested the officers frequent∣ly to lock up their pens and ink when they went out, so that he could not use them.</P>
<P>Ques. 7th. From whom did lieut. Gregg receive his orders to apprehend and confine cox.</P>
<P>Ans. From capt. Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, the then commanding of∣ficer.</P>
<P>Ques 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. When Cox was brought to you to be confined was there any charge against him in writing left with you, or any particular mode for keeping him pointed out to you.</P>
<P>Ans. No —all the orders I gave to the officers under my command were de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cretionary, and such I believe were best calculated to secure him,</P>
<P>Quest. 9th. After you had by the Governor been permitted to let Cox walk a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out in the Fort in charge of a commissioned officer—did you ever re∣ceive any orders to return him into close confine∣ment—</P>

<P>I arrived at Smithland about the 8th of April, 1798; when I first became acquainted with Mr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Zachariah Cox—shortly after my arrival, there was a party of riotous and bad characters collected in Smithland, who abused sundry good citizens &amp; travellers; no civil officer being at or near the place—the orderly citizens collected and formed themselves into a society, for the purpose of keep∣ing the town clear of those vagabonds and disor∣derly men, and by election appointed a committee for that purpose, and to arbitrate and determine controversies between the citizens, who might see cause to abide thereby; by which means the town was soon cleared of all infamous and riotous cha∣racters, &amp; the greatest harmony &amp; friendship existed among the citizens, &amp; the strictest attention observed to strangers, particularly federal and all civil of∣ficers. The citizens used weekly on Saturday e∣venings to associate and muster for their own im∣provement, &amp; to be prepared for defence, in case of an attack from the savages, which for sometime we had reason to apprehend—in such cases they gene∣rally nominated some men to act as temporary offi∣cers. Some time in the month of June, a man by the name of Medad Mitchel, without authority (as I understood) made an attempt to organize the militia—Zachariah Cox being informed of the circumstance forbid the measure—observing that he (Mitchel) nor no other person there, was vest∣ed with that authority. Mr Mitchel measurably persisting in his attempt, and frequently in all com∣panies speaking disrespectful of government, and the officers of it. Z Cox told Mitchel that he was wrong, and ordered him to leave the settlement in consequence of his improper conduct—observing that such conduct would be injurious to the settle∣ment
<PB N="64" REF="035360_0064_10049FEFAFD7A288"/>and settlers—Mitchel was afterwards restor∣ed to his citizenship, on promise that he would in future observe a proper conduct; and on making sundry acknowledgements to the citizens. About the last of June, col Shelby was solicited by Z. Cox and the other citizens, to organize the mili∣tia of Smithland agreeable to the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Kentu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ky.</P>
<P>On the 4th of July, col. Shelby made a visit to Smithland, appointed an election of officers which was effected, and the militia organised agreeable to the laws of the state. On the 15th of July, Z. Cox in company with sundry other citizens of of Smithland, set out down the river Ohio, with a view (as I understood) of exploring the country west of the river Mississippi—the company being stopped from passing Massac by the federal mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tary; col. Shelby was wrote on the subject, who came to Smithland in person, with J. Ramsey <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and to∣gether with Maj Gift, in company with sundry o∣ther citizens went to Massac, and obtained leave for Z Cox with his barge and crews to pass, which was effected as well by col. Shelby's approbation as by that of the officer of Massac; sundry others of the company at the same time passed the south east side of Ohio by land, under the authority of col Shelby and the civil authority of the county of Christian, who joined their respective boats and crews some distance below Massac, from whence the company all proceeded on to New Madrid—but they not being able to procure a permit from the Spanish officer of that post, to explore the country west of the Mississippi, all returned except Z. Cox &amp; 13 others who with myself descended the Mississip∣pi in Cox's barge; on our arrival at Natchez, there was a current report among the citizens of that a lace, that the military troops intended to seize Z.

<P>About the 20th-day of April A. D▪ 1798. I arri∣ved at the town of Smithland on the Ohio river, when I first became acquainted with col. Z. Cox, to whom I had sundry letters of introduction, being also interrested in the Tennessee purchase in a small degree, I made enquiries of col. Cox, with respect to that business, and what were his prospects res∣pecting forming a settlement at the Muscle Shoals; col. Cox told me that sundry applications made by himself, was then before the President of the U. S▪ soliciting leave to extinguish the Indian claim on a part of the Tennessee purchase, &amp; to settle the same, the fate of said application was not yet known but he was in hopes that at the present treaty to be held with the Cherokee Indians, the President would grant his petition, provided the Indians could be reconciled to the measure. I as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed col. Cox the
<PB N="67" REF="035360_0067_10049FF975B2FA90"/>encouragement given to settlers at Smithland, he told me one lot in town—&amp; on the citizen improv∣ing the same, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing there 12 months, they should each be entitled to a bounty of 1,001 acres of land in the Tennessee purchase, in the tract of country set apart for emigrants, provided the said citizen should settle upon, or cause the same to be fetled upon and improved the ensuing season after a settlement could be effected consistant with the approbation of Government; being at that time in no business, I joined with col. Cox, to become one of the setlers at Smithland: &amp; by my own request I received a permit from col. Cox, to bring forward 25 emigrants, on the conditions above stated; I ne∣ver heard col. say, or intimate any thing like forc∣ing a settlemant at the Muscle Shoals, but to the contrary, that the measure could nor would not be attempted, untill the approbation of Government was first obtained; &amp; that if it was not the policy of government to admit the measure at that time, it would come in some future day, the property would then be good, in the mean while a lott in Smithland would reward the emigrants, as they could then employ themselves to advantage during the year, which would give a spring to the town, which was supposed would be a good commercial stand, for which purpose, I understood col. Cox intended to settle at Sld. himself untill such time, as a settlement of the M. Shoals, could be carried into effect, by consent of Government. The encourage∣ment proposed by col. Cox in a short time drew a considerable number of emigrants to Smithland, I carried myself, about 30 men of good characters, all of whom received their lot promised—, and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of them improved the same. The orderly ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ens previous to my last arrival at Sld. had
<PB N="68" REF="035360_0068_10049FFB1D06F820"/>formed themselves into an association, and chosen a committee for the purpose of keeping out of town riotous and bad characters, and settling controver∣sies between such of the citizens as might think proper to abide thereby—sundry riotous and infamous characters was expelled from the town, by which means the orderly citizens e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joy∣ed the most perfect peace and harmony. The ci∣tizens used on saturday evenings to associate and muster for their own improvement, as well as to be prepared for defence in case of an at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k from the Indians, which for sometime we had reason to ap∣prehend. Some time in the month of June, a man by the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of Medad Mitchel made an at∣tempt to organize the militia, and solicited me to join him for that purpose—I understood said Mit. chell that he was to stand as Maj of a battalion —he (Mitchel) in a remote part of the town, had a number of citizens collected for that purpose, and was in the execution of the object—I not being acquainted with the motives, went to col. Cox and informed him of the circumstance, at which col. Cox appeared much irritated, observing that Mit∣chel certainly had a design to destoy the peace and reputation of all the citizens▪ The col. sent me re∣questing Mitchel to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ist in his pursuit, and to come to him, which he Mitchel did.</P>
<P>col Z. Cox abused Mitchel very much for his con∣duct, told him the impropriety of such a measure, and the improper use that might be made of it, &amp; ordered Mitchel in consequence there of to leave the ground, for the above conduct, and his abuse of Government and the ossi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of it—which he Mit∣chel repeatedly exercised in all companies and pla∣ces, although frequently checked by Z. Cox, in
<PB N="69" REF="035360_0069_10049FFFE40B99A0"/>my presence—said Mitchel was again restored to citizenship on making sundry acknowledgments to the citizens, and pledging himself most solemnly that he would observe a proper conduct in future. The latter end of June col. Z. Cox and sundry o∣ther citizens of Smithland, sent a messenger to col. Shelby, requesting him to come to Smithland, and organize the militia, agreeable to the laws of Ken∣tucky: col. Shelby made us a visit the 4th of July, called a general muster, and I believe legally orga∣nized as many as five companies, amongst the num∣ber myself was one—and from col. Shelby I re∣ceived a certificate to stand at the head of one com∣pany as capt. The regulations of the town and settlements being now legally and well organized; col Cox made a proclamation of his intended route to New Orleans for commercial objects (as I under∣stood) and that he intended on his route to spend the summer and fore part of the fall in exploring the country West of the river Mississippi, provided the approbation of the Spanish government could be obtained. Provisions being rather scarce at Smithland, a number of citizens expressed a desire to accompany col. Cox, and accordingly prepared for the route—I being among the number, on our descent of the river Ohio; the federal troops for∣bid Z. Cox and company passing the garrison: col. Cox and several of the officers of Kentucky orga∣nized in colonel Shelhy's regiment, wrote him, soliciting his advice; col. Shelby in company with J. Ramsey <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> made us a visit—they went to Massac in company with Major Gist and sundry other citizens, and obtained leave for col. Cox with his barge, the boats and thirty odd men to pass, col. Cox accordingly passed Massac with the boats; all the rest of the company passed by land on the East side of Ohio, through Christian count
<PB N="70" REF="035360_0070_1004A002C7A61588"/>by col. Shelby's order and request—they joined col. Cox some short distance below Massac—we proceeded on to New M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id; col. Cox waited on the Spanish officer of that place, who treated the company very politely. The Spanish commander at New Madrid not being authorised to admit Z. Cox and company to explore the country West of the river Mississippi (as I was informed) the com∣pany all returned except col. Cox and 13 others, who descended the river Mississippi: myself being one of the company who returned to Smithland; on our arrival at Massac, we fell in company with General Wilkinson, by whose orders we were ar∣bitrarily disarmed—our trunks and saddle bags searched, one of which was out open, the owner not being present:</P>
<P>They also broke open sundry sealed letters, &amp; our goods and property was shamefully abused, our pocketts picked by military power—my certificate as captain, received from col. Shelby was taken out of my pocket, by Lieu. W. P. Smith, with milita∣ry force at the point of the bayonet.</P>
<P>I demanded the paper afterwards which was de∣nied and never returned to me; we being at length liberated—returned to Smithland. During the time of my acquaintance with Z. Cox I never knew him speak, or suggest any thing inimical to Govern∣ment, but in all cases he has professed the highest love for his country, and respect for the laws of it, which he has as far as comes to my knowledge sup∣ported with integrity, and ever held himself amea∣nable to.</P>
