<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A PREFACE is, in common, like the Bill of Fare to an En∣tertainment; where the reader sees what he has to set down to. But the author of the <HI>Pill for Porcupine</HI> treats his customers a little in the Irish style, and introduces his essay with something which he might, with more justice, have called a postcript.
<Q><L>So Paddy's reason never fails</L>
<L>To geer draft horses by their tails.</L></Q>
However, he calls it a Preface, and as such we will consider it.— The principal intention of this said preface is to give us a taste of the author's wit against the <HI>story-tellers and pumpkin-vines of Connecticut and Massachusetts;</HI> and to drag Mr. CAREY limp∣ing in, by the head and shoulders, in order to tell the reader that Porcupine had dubbed him a man of honor, that he was a good de∣mocrat, and had risen from care to contentment, without being elated by his prosperity.</P>
<P>With these compliments to Mr. CAREY I perfectly acquiesce, for as Porcupine has not been very liberal in conferring praise, there is the more reason to suppose it merited in the present instance; and he is quite as welcome to a place of honor among the democrats, for as these gentry are not remarkable for their attachment to the con∣stitution and government of the United States, God forbid I should ever envy him his fame. If there is any credit to be gained by opposing the government and its chief magistrate, under which many a citizen, besides Mr. CAREY, has risen from <HI>care</HI> to <HI>con∣tentment,</HI> from the state of a needy adventurer to that of indepen∣dance and ease, he is welcome to it all.</P>
<P>But I plainly see that no order of society, no change of circum∣stances
<PB N="iv" REF="030314_0003_0FE74F0012261E40"/>
will destroy inveterate habits and the prejudices of education, if engrafted on a natural stock. Some men, we know, are distin∣guished through their lives by a love of peace, order, and stability; others again are ever restless, turbulent and vindictive, and where∣ever they go, they both carry their distinctive habits along with them.</P>
<Q>"Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt."</Q>
<P>He has now a chance, therefore, of partaking of that "esteem" and of "those caresses" of the world, so pleasing to the ingenuous mind, and of becoming, as well as Mr. YOUNG, "one of your fine modern gentlemen of yesterday." But it is not only here; in all the civilized countries of the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> riches give consideration to their possessors: it is so in Scotland as well as Ireland; it is so even in France, that ill-fated country of sans-culottism: riches have made many a man taken notice of there, and marked his head for the guillotine; if the owner even was innocent, his wealth was a liber∣ticide.</P>
<P>Having now said all that I intended of the Preface, I will make a few remarks on the manner in which the piece was introduced to the public. There was as much mystery used in bringing it to mar∣ket as if the author thought the ware was contraband, and his life was in danger; but surely so much caution was not necessary in Phila∣delphia, one of the freest places in the world for scandal; where men deal without fear or restraint in all that is abusive and scurri∣lous, and where neither wisdom nor virtue give protection to their owners.—On its first appearance the sale was confined to the publishers, and to the ware-houses of Messrs. CAREY, RICE, and CAMP∣BELL, as if it had been a company adventure, and they were re∣solved, contrary to the common usage, to engross it all to themselves; as they did for some time, though they afterwards permitted others to partake with them, finding it necessary, I suppose, in order to dispose of their ware.</P>
<P>But no part of this mysterious business deserves more notice than the choice that was made of a publisher. It looked as if the author intended to give the whole an air of burlesque, by choosing out of all the printers and book-sellers in the city, a sober old gentleman, with the phiz of a covenanting elder, to midwife his scurrility. This was a grave preface indeed to a dirty subject; but though a little singular, was not altogether without example. It is likely he took
<PB N="v" REF="030314_0004_0FE74F0A22BAC710"/>
the hint from Dr. SWIFT's Tale of a Tub. The Dean tells us in his history of the three brothers, that when Jack had an itch for throwing dirt, he always began the work with a down-looking, psalm-singing face, in order to draw the people about him, and then pelted away manfully. Our author, I suppose, thought the trick a good one, and resolved to try it in vending his pamphlet; with this difference only, that the one distributed his filth in the streets, and the other was to do it from behind his counter.</P>
<P>As it would be tiresome to myself, as well as disgusting to the reader, to follow this writer through the whole of his misrepresent∣ations, scurrility and nonsense, in the following answer I shall only select some particular parts of the performance, and offer a few observations on them; which I will do with as much connection and order as the subject will admit, or is possible in pursuing a Jack o' Lanthorn, who dances from place to place, without any other appar∣ent plan than to scatter abuse as he goes.</P>

<HEAD>TIT FOR TAT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>"WHAT a cabal was raised" says this writer in the first page of his pamphlet, "against citizen GE∣NET, because a certain party had asserted, that he interfered in the internal government of our country: was he more culpable than the other (the British agent) who does it by means of a hire∣ling?" as if there was any analogy between the conduct of GE∣NET and that of <HI>Peter Porcupine,</HI> who is the hireling alluded to. In one case, a foreign minister questioned the authority of the Executive of the United States; threatened to appeal from it to the people at large, and really did so; caballed with turbulent and ambitious men; set on foot popular clubs to embarrass the government; and in short carried his insolence and intrigues to such an alarming height, as to oblige the President to insist on his recall: in the other, it is in defence of this government, against the emissaries that GENET left behind, and his successors have since raised up, that most, if not all the essays under the signa∣ture of Porcupine have been levelled. So that if the British minister or agent had any concern in setting him to work, which sincerely I do not believe, he certainly acted a friendly part by by our government: but as there is not the least evidence of such a connection, it would be unjust to deprive Peter of any part of the credit he has gained by a spontaneous act.</P>
<P>As far as I am able to judge of his motives from his writings, he has been provoked to take up the pen by the scurrilous abuse that has been wantonly heaped on his native country; and to defend the government of this against its worst enemies, the creatures of France, who have endeavored to reduce
<PB N="8" REF="030314_0006_0FE5B95040026548"/>
America to the same subjection to her ambitious polititics as every other nation that has been cursed with her alliance. This sprightly and ingenious writer expects no other reward nor patronage than such as he has received already, from a liberal and enlightened public: his enemies therefore may be assured that he neither feels "a contrition" for what he has published, nor "has the fountain nearly ran dry." Long may he continue the champion of order and the federal government, as well as a scourge to all its ene∣mies, whether of American, English, French or Irish growth! The peaceable and good citizens of the United States, from whatever nation derived, he never designed to offend, and he is happy in being assured that few of them are his real enemies, whatever the cut-throats of France or the thieves of Ireland may be. The base attempt, therefore, of this pamphleteer, and o∣thers, to accuse him of vilifying the very respectable citizens of Philadelphia, as a "mob or banditti," is of a piece with other democratic tricks, and is doubtless intended to collect a mob, in order to answer his wit and arguments by the rhetoric of stones and brick-bats.</P>
<P>As we proceed in the examination of this pamphlet, we shall find the writer is as much an enemy of human nature, and of all its amiable feelings, as he is of candor and truth. In page 10, "With regard" says he "to the murders and outrages com∣mitted by the French nation, there are none will believe a single fact stated by Porcupine, except <HI>credulous children</HI> or prejudiced <HI>old women,</HI> sinking into their dotage." Why he excepts children and old women I cannot guess: it would have been nearer the mark had he said <HI>they only</HI> disbelieve, for few others are so igno∣rant of what has passed on the sanguinary theatre of France, as to doubt what Porcupine has narrated in his <HI>"Bloody Buoy."</HI> The murders at Paris on the 2d and 3d of September; the massacres at Avignon and Versailles; the shootings and drown∣ings at Lyons and Nantes; and all the other horrid scenes in the various departments, which fix an indelible stain on the name of liberty, have all been confirmed by such a cloud of e∣vidence, that none but those who are determined to shut out conviction, can entertain a doubt. Their own public papers, to go no further, contain undeniable proofs of the ferocious cha∣racter
<PB N="9" REF="030314_0007_0FE5B9526FC7E348"/>
of this people, from the first year of the revolution to this day—from JOURDAN, the cut-throat of Avignon, to BUONA∣PARTE, the modern Attila, and scourge of Italy; and the hi∣stories of all their former civil wars are stamped with the same character, although none of them equalled the present in bloo∣dy scenes. Formerly they had some sense of Religion to re∣strain them, but now the Stygian philosophy of their <HI>Diderots,</HI> their <HI>Ceruttis</HI> and their <HI>Condorcets</HI> has not only soured the small mixture of humanity they had in their natures, but removed all fear of God and love of man from their hearts. In aid of na∣tive ferocity, they now possess the <HI>sang froid</HI> of daemons.</P>
<P>The hecatombs of innocent women and children, sacrificed on the altar of their Moloch, the Goddess of Liberty, are "no evidence" says this pamphleteer, none at all "of the cruelty and injustice of the nation, but are the fullest proofs of their lenity and forbearance." What think you, Reader, of a monster who would venture to contaminate an American press with such sentiments? Beware of such men, for he that would advocate such cruelties, would imitate them, if he dared. He is worse, indeed, than the very instruments who committed them, for he cannot plead the same excuse of example, of fear or revenge: he sits down, coolly, at his desk, three thousand miles remov∣ed from the terrible scene, and enjoys, with the complacency of a daemon, the sacrifice of thousands of victims, whose cruel fate would make an American savage shudder with horror. With him it is all "lenity and forbearance, short-lived preju∣dice, or the result of irresistible necessity": and so said <HI>Robes∣pierre</HI> and his satellites, when engaged in their murdering work: their cant phrase for murder was <HI>travailler à la Revolu∣tion.</HI> One of these monsters, writing of the Royalists in la Vendée, very coolly remarked, that if the remaining popula∣tion did not exceed thirty or forty thousand souls,—"certainly the quickest way to finish the war, is to cut all their throats"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>: and he said right, but it would require an army of such canni∣bals as himself, or as our pamphleteer, to execute the order, and such, unhappily, were found. This very humane dele∣gate,
<PB N="10" REF="030314_0008_0FE5B957DD5BCEE0"/>
reader, was one of your modern philosophers! the au∣thor of a treatise entitled <HI>Prejudices Destroyed!</HI> and these mon∣sters are still held up by their American admirers as worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>But to repeat proofs of the unparalleled atrocities committed in France, would be painful to the humane reader, and to those of the same temper as this writer it would be labour lost; they would not "believe a single fact" because recorded in the <HI>Bloody Buoy.</HI> To such I recommend the perusal of Miss HELEN WIL∣LIAMS'S last letters from Paris. She is a republican, as well as a great admirer of the French nation: her sister is married to one of the Revolutionists. "When the future historian," says this elegant writer, "whose faithful pen must trace the hideous features of the Vendéan war, in all their deformity, shall de∣scribe scenes which I dare not name, let no one, because he may consider such crimes as scarcely within the verge of human possibility, doubt that they have been committed."</P>
<P>But, according to this writer, Porcupine is not alone "in his abuse of the French nation; Mr. HAMILTON has trodden the same path before him. The latter in his writings has endeavor∣ed to prove that it was not from disinterested motives that France took an active part in the American Revolution, but to pull down the enormous and overbearing pride of England"— and is there a single Democrat weak enough to think otherwise? "But" adds he, <Q>admitting this was the motive, <HI>they</HI> certainly loved us more than Great Britain did; and if they loved us more, ought not our gratitude to be in proportion to that love, in preference to Britain, as theirs was in preference to us.</Q> There is something very much like nonsense both in meaning and construction of this whining sentence about love, but as I am not fond of quarrelling with men for the blunders of mere ignorance, I will endeavor to guess at his meaning. It is then, if I understand him, that, although France entered in∣to the American war from mere hatred and jealousy of Great-Britain, she thereby evinced her superior affection for the peo∣ple of these States, and has, in consequence, a just claim to a preference when her interest and that of her rival are brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030314_0009_0FE5B9595580A380"/>But if we admit the premises, the conclusion by no means follows. The British colonies in America were planted, che∣rished and protected by the parent state at a great expense; she thought she had a legitimate authority over them, and when they revolted, she considered them as rebellious children, whom she had a right to reduce to obedience and submission: had Ireland or any part of the island of Great-Britain revolted, she would have acted in the same manner: but it does not follow, because she carried her parental claims too far, that she had less friendship for her children than a foreign nation had, whose government was an absolute despotism, whose religion and man∣ners were diametrically opposite—a nation which had been the inveterate enemy of the name of an Englishman for ages, and which, not twenty years before, had invaded this country with fleets and armies, with an intention to subjugate or expel the inhabitants. For a bigotted tyrant to be converted into a pa∣tron of civil and religious liberty, an avowed enemy into a real friend, without any apparent cause, is too great a miracle to meet with belief now a days. If a man does me a good office to serve himself or to injure a third person who is his enemy, or for both reasons combined, there is no merit whatever in the act. The case between this country and France was exactly parallel. She considered the British colonies as part of the national strength, as a limb of the body politic, and if she could but cut it off, she would not care if it rotted immediately afterwards, unless she expected to derive some future benefit from it.</P>
<P>Her motives to assist America were just the same as induced her to aid the Pretender and the rebels of Scotland in 1715 and 1745; to excite the <HI>patriots</HI> in Holland, who, by the bye, were all <HI>aristocrats,</HI> against the Stadtholder; to support the par∣ty in Sweden called the <HI>Hats</HI> against another called the <HI>Night-Caps,</HI> to the great detriment of the nation; and to assist the Genoese in subjugating the brave inhabitants of Corsica. All these acts originated in the same base and cowardly policy, that ever governed the cabinet of Versailles, and that still predomi∣nates in the secret councils of the nation, as we have wofully
<PB N="12" REF="030314_0010_0FE5B95A83A9CA38"/>
experienced. A tenth part of the money they have spent, and a twentieth part of the pains they have taken, to disturb and injure their neighbors, wisely bestowed on their own people and government, would long ago have placed them with real digni∣ty at the head of the nations, the great object of their ambi∣tion; whereas by their most splendid successes hitherto they have never risen to eminence but with the curses of all good men on their heads. This, so far as relates to the ancient gov∣ernment, has the consent of the republicans themselves, and how applicable it is to the present rulers, posterity will decide.</P>
<P>But if we leave motive out of the question, and admit that "one good turn deserves another", and that it does, has grown into a maxim, it was certainly due to the party who did the ac∣tion; to the royal family and nobles of France; to men who have been murdered, or have fled from the daggers of the as∣sassins, and whose memories the democrats of this country, the vile ingrates, as well as the Jacobins of France, pursue with in∣cessant yells of defamation. Their enemies in France would not allow them to breathe the vital air, and those of America will not admit that they possess a single virtue. The merit of all their actions in promoting the independence of America, by some kind of hocus pocus, is instantly transferred to the Re∣publicans, who had no more voice in the business than the slaves of Algiers. All the benefits we received from Louis XVI. are carried to the credit of the republic, and all the evils we suffer∣ed under Louis XV. are charged to the despotism of the king. This is the way these democrats keep their accounts: God preserve my affairs from such rascally book-keepers!</P>
<P>"National pride, ambition, folly and interest," this scribbler asserts, "are the governing and only motives, which actuate kings towards each other," and yet <Q>France, [mark the man's inconsistency, France, under an absolute monarch] more <HI>enlight∣ened</HI> and <HI>magnanimous</HI> than all the rest, gave America early proofs of her friendship, by entering into a treaty of alliance with her.</Q> Enlightened and magnanimous! Ah! poor Louis, he would have been less magnanimous, indeed I think he would, had he been more enlightened! Little did he imagine, when he sent his <HI>La Fayettes,</HI> his <HI>D'Estaings, De Grasses,</HI> and <HI>Ro∣chambeaus,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="030314_0011_0FE5B95C1D24B950"/>
to fight our battles, that they would bring back with them a tyger from the woods of America, that in the course of twelve years would destroy him and all his family!—and that after he was dead the people of America would curse his memo∣ry! No, no, magnanimity was as far from the heart of this unfor∣tunate king as foresight was from his head. He intended to dig a pit for his neighbor, and fell into it himself. It is a lesson of importance to kings; and no country was so sit to teach the lesson as France, whose kings, for more than three centuries before, had been constantly employed in embroiling the affairs of their neighbors.</P>
<P>But we will leave these monarchs to their own designs: I grant that, in general, they are ambitious and interested enough, and I am afraid the motives of the ill-fated Louis were not pur∣er than those of kings in common—if they were, I am sure we have been vastly ungrateful—and we will now turn to the con∣nection between republics. Here, if we believe this writer, and all of the same stamp, the scene brightens: it is on the repub∣lican floor we are told to look for "universal benevolence", "dis∣interested friendship", and "cordial attachment"—a mere Mil∣lenium!</P>
<P>I do not know from what sources this writer has derived his historical knowledge; to judge from what he asserts, one would imagine that he had studied the History of Utopia, the Repub∣lic of Plato, the Social Contract of Rousseau, and other politi∣cal reveries: I never read them but as ingenious romances: my information concerning men in civil society, is drawn from the annals of governments not quite so visionary. I have looked into the history of Switzerland, cantoned into a number of pet∣ty republics; surrounded and intersected by almost impassable mountains; poor, frugal, and in a good degree virtuous: yet the daemon of discord found his way among them, and often impelled one diminutive commonwealth to draw the sword a∣gainst another. Venice and Genoa, two commercial republics, have engaged in long and frequent wars, to extend their trade or enlarge their power. Every school-boy knows that Rome and Carthage, two of the most eminent republics of antiquity, were the slaves of avarice and ambition, and contended for empire
<PB N="14" REF="030314_0012_0FE5B96336C4BC98"/>
with unrelenting animosity, until one of them was wholly ruin∣ed. Carthage had her Hamilcars and her Hannibals, and Rome had her Catos, the patriots of those days, who were con∣stantly impelling ther fellow-citizens to destroy fleets, burn towns, and cut the throats of the inhabitants, or to drag them into captivity. The Republics of Lacedaemon, Athens and Thebes were always at daggers drawn. The States of Greece were never at peace among themselves, except when the swords of the Persians were at their doors: and their common danger was not sufficient to unite them perfectly, until they were bound together by the authority of one head, a Philip or an Alexan∣der. Had it not been for some such power, to silence their de∣magogues, patriots such as we are cursed with, nothing is more likely than that they would have yielded at last to the arms or the gold of the great king; who, when he could not conquer, knew, as well as any French minister, that "Patriots have their price."</P>
<P>What shall we think then of this silly writer, when he talks of the interest, ambition and pride of kings, and of the vir∣tues and friendship of Republics? shall we not say that he talks like one that dreams? But these quacks have a plaister for eve∣ry sore. They will tell you, that the ancients were ignorant beings, unacquainted with the principles of government, with the due arrangement of power, the checks and balances disco∣vered by modern politicians. This is not so clear as some may imagine; but be it as it may, it is certain that they possessed quite as much public virtue, and as much love of country, the grand cement of society, as we do; and were quite as free from the selfish passions, the bane of public and private happi∣ness, as we are, after so many centuries of improvement. It is virtue that gives stability to empire, it is righteousness that ex∣alteth a nation, more than any chosen form of government whatever.</P>
<P>We have already had a scantling, in our own infant country, the best constructed republic that ever existed, of the propensi∣ties of these same fellows, called patriots: we have seen how they would manage our affairs if God in his wrath should put them into their hands: have we not experienced, in a time of
<PB N="15" REF="030314_0013_0FE5B96471F29B18"/>
universal peace, and a state of unexampled prosperity, that there are men among us <HI>proud, ambitious, discontented</HI> and <HI>stupid enough</HI> to attempt to subvert this goodly structure, to prostrate its honor in dust, and to rush madly into a war, without cause, or means, or end?</P>
<P>These men should either cease clamouring against the govern∣ment of their own country, and vomiting their gall against its best citizens, or say no more in praise of republican virtue and happiness. Let us first shew an example of the love of peace, without which no country can prosper, of harmony, of mode∣ration and wisdom, that the world may see what good the sy∣stem is really capable of producing; as we are the only republic now existing, except a few insignificant communities nestled a∣mong the rocks of Italy: and if, after the experience of one hundred years, which is a short age for an empire, we have proved the excellence of the form and materials, we may exult. Until then, every wise man will be modest, and forbear joining in cry with those yelping curs who are ever disturbing the world with their noise.</P>
<P>But let us follow this writer; <Q>to convince America and the world more fully" says he, "that her former services were not the effect of a temporary, sordid, selfish interest, she (France) has since made overtures for entering into a treaty anew; on principles the most <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>flattering</HI> to the national dignity of America, and <HI>advantageous</HI> to her inter∣rests. But Mr. HAMILTON, <HI>stiff in opinion and always in the wrong,</HI></Q> not content with questioning the purity of Louis's mo∣tives in the former treaty, "by his influence in the cabinet council of America, defeated her friendly designs, and render∣ed all her (generous) overtures (for another) abortive." Sad fellow! But as it is not just to condemn him, before we exam∣ine these overtures, nor to take things on the word of this writer, we will recur to Citizen GENET'S account of the affair: he was better acquainted with the business than any other person on this side the Atlantic, being the agent employed to bring it forward. In his <HI>Instructions,</HI> which he afterwards pub∣lished in his own defence, we were informed that the United States were invited to the honor of making "a common cause"
<PB N="16" REF="030314_0014_0FE5B96541CF2E38"/>
with the French, in their war with all the world; of "guaran∣teeing their West-India islands"; of "receiving commissions", as generals, colonels, captains, &amp;c. in and under the authority of the Republic; "of suspending all our other commercial pur∣suits; and" of refusing admission into our ports to all nations with whom they were or might be at war; in order—for what, think you—"<HI>to befriend the Empire of Liberty!!</HI>—and on condition of our compliance with these very <HI>honorable</HI> and <HI>flat∣tering</HI> terms, and on this condition alone; we are promised "a free commerce with the French West-Indies"; where, by the bye, the whites, blacks and yellows were too busy in burning towns and plantations, and in cutting of throats, in a little dis∣pute they had of their own, about <HI>the empire of liberty,</HI> to attend much to commerce. If the British had not landed, and snat∣ched part of the country from destruction, I believe they would by this time have had no commerce at all.</P>
<P>This is the treaty the French citizen had to propose, and which the President and his council thought proper to reject. Indeed what plea could they offer to the world, or to their own consciences; what temptation had they for contracting any kind of treaty with a band of daring usurpers, whose hands were still reeking with the blood of their own king, our benefactor, whom they had murdered in violation of the most solemn con∣tract. The alliance might have been useful and glorious to them, but to us it would have been disgraceful and ruinous. What think you, my fellow-citizens, of a foreigner, who at this time of day undertakes to advocate such insidious and ini∣mical overtures? is there any degree of contempt and detesta∣tion adequate to such insolence? A man must either be a fool himself, or have a very mean opinion of the understanding of his readers, before he would venture to pollute paper with so daring an insult.</P>
<P>Were it not for the great pains that have been taken and still are taking to mislead the public mind, it would be unnecessary to take any notice at this time, of a subject that has been so of∣ten and so fully handled before; but before I quit it, I will make one more remark, and it will come in more à propos in this place than in any other. Whatever advantages the United
<PB N="17" REF="030314_0015_0FE5B9675660CA50"/>
States derived from their treaties with France, they ceased with the death of the king: since that epoch they have produced no∣thing but discord: and happy had it been for us if the Execu∣tive, when citizen GENET first set his foot in America, had, with his wonted firmness, declared that the relation between the two countries was dissolved; that the guillotine of Robespierre and Orleans had cut the tie. He would then have had but one battle to fight: whereas, by admitting the revival of a contract extinguished by themselves, he has had to contend with the republic and her American allies about the interpretation of every material article; and planted thorns in his own admini∣stration, which have at length goaded him to a resignation, when his virtues, talents, and good name are still necessary to the preservation of his country.</P>
<P>However heterodox this opinion may sound in the ears of some men, I am sure it is not singular, and I think the recent conduct of the French sufficiently proves that it is not unfound∣ed. They have manifested by their actions, which speak louder than words, that they consider the treaties as null and void, so far at least as they bind on themselves, and that they never intended to make use of them as any thing more than a stepping stone to the new one projected: and as they have failed answer∣ing this purpose, they are resolved that they shall not protect our ships and cargoes from their rapacity. After this short digres∣sion, reader, we will now step back to the spot where we left our author discharging his venom against Mr. HAMILTON.</P>
<P>"From the influence" says he, "Mr. HAMILTON'S writings <HI>has</HI> had, in giving a tinge to the American character, I am convinced <HI>it</HI> will render <HI>them</HI> the contempt and scorn of Europe." That is, his writings first tinge the American character, then <HI>it</HI> renders <HI>them</HI> the contempt and scorn of Europe—which is a droll kind of a battle between <HI>it</HI> and <HI>them:</HI> however, we shall by this means be fully revenged of these wicked writings, for if they once become the scorn of Europe, it will not be long be∣fore they will become the scorn of America too.—But I do not believe a word of all this nonsense:—it is a beautiful tinge that Mr. H's writings have given to the American character—it is the
<PB N="18" REF="030314_0016_0FE5B96ADC3538D0"/>
sky-blue of peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See "Pacificus"</NOTE>; and if such publications as the one now before me do not communicate any worse impression, which from their fleeting nature I hope they will not, I am convinced she long will retain her present amiable colour in the eyes of the world. God, in his mercy, preserve her from the blood-co∣loured tinge of France!</P>
<P>"Have we not daily striking proofs of my assertion," adds he. "Have not the American citizens been treated with <HI>coldness</HI> by the French"? Yes, if by coldness he means that they have seized, and plundered, and detained our property, to the value of four or five millions of dollars, for which we shall never receive a single sous. This is the coldness of death, and is a miserable return for the animating warmth American hospitality has communicated to their half-dead, distressed emigrants. "Have they not been harassed, vexed, and buffetted by the English? Yes, God confound the plunderers of both nations: but it is unjust not to make this distinction, that the latter owed us no favours, and that by the last treaty with them, we shall recover full compensation for all our legal demands. "And have not the Algerines compelled us to purchase a treaty, at the enormous sum of twelve hundred thousand dollars?" Yes, and they have, to the eternal disgrace of Europe, compelled her most powerful states to buy treaties on still more humiliating terms: but I hardly think those blackguard Mussulmen ever saw any of Mr. HAMILTON'S writings; or care in the least whether we hate the French or the English most. They hate all men, who are not circumcised according to the law of Mahomet, and if they have any property, consider it as a natural game.</P>
<P>We have now done with his abuse of the French; <HI>the only na∣tion</HI> from which America could expect to receive <HI>real acts of friendship!</HI> and shall next follow our author in viewing his conduct with regard to the United States internally, "where" he says "we will find as little cause of approbation and panegric." Then he proceeds to tell his readers that in the Convention, summoned to frame the Federal Constitution, Mr. HAMILTON was foiled in his attempt to introduce a monarchical government,
<PB N="19" REF="030314_0017_0FE5B96C79D8D298"/>
and that, on finding the constitution was popular, and "admitted great latitude of construction," he at length signed it: but as this was forced work, he did it grudgingly, and not only "me∣ditated but sought revenge" for his disappointment.</P>
<P>However, from the account given his resentment was not very deep, or he had an excellent knack at concealing it; for the first act of public notoriety that we find him engaged in, was "in conjunction with Mr. MADISON, to write in support of the constitution"; and he did it so successfully that "he not only established his reputation as a man of abilities, but as a firm federalist, and that too among the real friends of the constitu∣tion." Whether he has persevered in supporting what he did not altogether approve, we shall see further as we proceed; but it is certain Mr. MADISON has changed in his conduct greatly, for he has openly and strenuously opposed the constitution and its whole executive branch. The one has been the champion of what he did not approve, because it was popular, and the other has combated what he did approve, because he has been disappointed. Which, reader, is the most virtuous public character?</P>
<P>But resentment still rankled in Mr. HAMILTON'S breast; he still cherished a predilection for royalty and the pomps of govern∣ment—and of course a secret aversion for our plain republican manners. To this source may be traced, says our <HI>equality-man,</HI> the introduction of <HI>Etiquette, Bustle, Levees,</HI> and a train of other aristocratic creatures, who daily mounted guard at the President's door, to the great scandal and terror of all good sans culottes: indeed it is strongly suspected that these same gentry, in con∣junction with HAMILTON and others, formed a conspiracy to blow up the Constitution and all its friends, some dark night, when they were fast asleep; but happily the design was discov∣ered time enough to prevent it.—</P>
<P>One of the principal persons engaged with him in the hellish plot was a certain Mr. JOHN FENNO, editor of the United States Gazette. The part he was to act, was to insert time after time, in his <HI>Courtly</HI> paper, certain insidious para∣graphs, calculated to poison the public mind, and to give it an aristocratic tinge; such, for instance, as "Just arrived in town, the Honorable Mr. such a one"—and "The Honorable Mr.
<PB N="20" REF="030314_0018_0FE5B96D9DDBF778"/>
—, from Richmond, Norfolk or Charleston, on his way to Boston"—and, to carry on the "Diabolical Scheme" still better, he was directed to "intersprerse, occasionally, some pious say∣ing of some good old woman to the eastward, who had been drowned for witchcraft," and a thousand other incantations, all tending to the same dreadful purpose. Happily, as I have said the plot was discovered before it was ripe for execution; by which "the paper lost it's circulation, and the printer was obliged to change it into a daily Gazette," as well as to raise the price from three to eight dollars pr. annum!!</P>
<P>When this machiavelian scheme failed, Mr. HAMILTON was obliged, says our Sansculottes, to vary his plan, and to attack some other quarter. As soon as he came into the office of Se∣cretary of the Treasury, for which the President was weak enough to think him well qualified, finding the finances of the United States, void of order, and void of hope, something like mother <HI>Chaos,</HI> before time began; when the domestic creditors apprehended all their scraps of paper would become, like old <HI>Conti,</HI> fit for nothing but to light a pipe with, and the foreign creditors began to look upon us as a nation of swindlers and pick-pockets—at this time, I say, he contrived his d—d fund∣ing system, by which hope was brought back to the widow and orphan at home, and foreigners recovered their ancient faith in American honour. This, it is plain, was a home stroke at the Democratic part of the Constitution, for, in direct op∣position to Democratic principles, it was calculated to pay off our debts; and every body knows that a man, and by the same reason, a government out of debt, is out of credit. Be∣sides, to pay debts is a mark of a pitiful spirit, unworthy the high-mettled Democrat, whose principal inducement to engage in the war, was to put his creditors at defiance.</P>
<P>But all that preceded was nothing, says our Pampheteer, to his last nefarious attempt, the <HI>Excise law.</HI> In this he mani∣fested the whole depth of his malice, as well as the extent of his talents. As he knew that the patriots beyond the moun∣tains, where they are as
<Q><L>"Thick as leaves that strew the brooks</L>
<L>In Val' Ombrosa"—</L></Q>
<PB N="21" REF="030314_0019_0FE5B97412754FB0"/>
were passionately fond of whiskey, he resolved that, as it was a Democratic liquor, they should not drink it duty free. He pretended that in the distilleries they wasted a grain, by which they might fatten hogs, horses and cows, and thereby increase the real wealth and strength of the state; instead of which, by drinking so much ardent spirits, they not only injured their healths, but continued poor and drunkards, as their fathers had been before them. For this reason he taxed it at the enor∣mous rate of seven or eight cents pr. gallon; and as it is not uncommon in that country for a man to consume a quart or more a day, so every day he chose to get drunk, he was obliged to pay two or three cents towards the discharge of the public debt. This any body will allow, was sufficient to shake the fidelity of the Whiskey counties, was it ever so firmly rooted, and to produce a revolt. It had the effect: and Braddock's field was the <HI>Mons sacer</HI> to which the plebeans seceded, to con∣sult and organize their force. Warm debates took place: some of the most wary, willing to secure a retreat, if things went contrary to their wish, proposed moderate measures, but
<Q><L>Others apart sat on a hill retired,</L>
<L>And reasoned high of war and separation,</L>
<L>Of Independence, and the de'il knows what.</L></Q></P>
<P>As is common on such occasions the violent prevailed: the standard of rebellion was unfurled, alias liberty-poles were erected, and damnation drank to HAMILTON and the Excise law in many gallon of whiskey. This our author says was the crisis that the Secretary wished for. It was not submission to the law he desired, it was opposition, which would pave the way for a military force. "Hence we find him giving encou∣ragement to the opposition, by an ill-timed forbearance of urg∣ing the judiciary authority." Had he at the commencement, "ordered suits in law to be commenced against the refractory, it is universally believed, by those who know better than Mr. HAMILTON, the temper of people in the western counties of Penn∣sylvania, and the <HI>respect which they have always manifested</HI> for the judiciary authority, that submission would have been ob∣tained:" or in other words, had the Secretary assumed a bold
<PB N="22" REF="030314_0020_0FE5B975463606E0"/>
decided tone at first, the business would have been brought sooner to a close.</P>
<P>Let us examine this statement a little further: let us suppose Fox, the cowardly deputy-marshal, who fled from among them to save his life, had been sent back with peremptory orders to execute his process at all risques whatever; or in case he could not be prevailed with to go, had the marshal himself been or∣dered to proceed on the business, and to summon all the civil au∣thority to his aid; the worst that could have happened, was, that some of them might have been scalped, and others of them perhaps only branded, or tarred and feathered, to the no small entertainment of the rebels. In such a case the militia would have been called out in 92 instead of 94, and sooner this had happened the better, as so much time would have been saved; for no body is foolish enough to believe, after the amend∣ments made in the law, and so much pains taken to reconcile them to it without success, they would have submitted, 'till they were forced. Force at length, and nothing but force, wrought submission: it was the logic of fifteen thousand bayonets that convinced the Western Sansculottes of their mistake, and taught them what they had never learned before, due "respect to the judiciary authority."</P>
<P>It is true enough therefore that the Secretary "was unac∣quainted with the temper" of the people. Accomodation or lenient measures were not calculated to operate successfully on their licentious spirits. After banishing the excise from among them, and the officers too, they might have returned to an im∣perfect submission, such as suited their own palates, for the be∣nefit of protection and defence, but it would ever have been precarious and uncertain. A man who by an excursion on the high-way, or on the high seas, acquires a booty worth pre∣serving, thinks the laws of some use, when they protect him in the enjoyment of his acquisitions. That is a dreadful villain indeed, who does not acknowledge the necessity of <HI>respecting</HI> the laws some part of his life.</P>
<P>After the massacre of the Indians at Conestogo and Lancaster, and the attempt that followed, to cut the throats of a remnant that fled to Philadelphia for shelter, some thirty years ago; and
<PB N="23" REF="030314_0021_0FE5B97705A90538"/>
after butchering the inhabitants of three or four Moravian towns in cold blood, at the close of the continental war; the heroes, these very whisky boys for aught I know, returned, very quietly, to their homes and to <HI>the respect they always had and since have manifested to the laws.</HI> These licentious pranks, these overleapings of law, are too habitual with some of the back settlers of Pennsylvania: at one time it is a thirst for blood, and at another for whiskey; but at all times it manifests a wild, disorderly, and somewhat a cruel temper.</P>
<P>But Mr. HAMILTON not only betrayed his ignorance, in the estimate he formed of the character of the Western people, he was equally mistaken when he took so much pains to procure evidence, to impeach those old foxes FINDLEY, SMILIE and GALLATIN. However active these gentlemen were at first, in spreading the whiskey mania, they soon found their authority with the populace was supplanted by new favorites, men of greater daring; and they wheeled to the right about, and left the poor deluded devils in the lurch. They took care to make their own peace by complying with the President's Proclamation, —the door left open for repenting sinners,—and HAMILTON might have earthed a fox in the forests of Alleghany, sooner than he could have entrapped one of them. No, no; "they became active in suppressing the Insurrection"—when they found it was likely to miscarry: they had raised the devil, and they were resolved to snatch at some credit in laying him too. Whether the ignorant herd will re-elect these betrayers to repre∣sent them in the general and state legislatures is uncertain; if they do, it will be considered hereafter as a proof either that they are extremely ignorant, or not sincere in their repentance.</P>
<P>But it is amazing, if we believe this writer, what a number of different forms the Secretary assumed to come at evidence to cri∣minate these leaders. One moment we find him in the charac∣ter of an "hospitable friend"; next he put on the "subtilty of a fiend"; and when these failed, we find him "like the frog in the fable"; and this frog is cloathed with all the "terrors of an inquisitorial monk, with knitted brow and angry look". In short old <HI>Proteus</HI> was a fool to our American secretary for variety of shapes: that slippery god could not assume more than one at
<PB N="24" REF="030314_0022_0FE5B9783857B8A8"/>
a time; but here we find the secretary like a frog, and a monk, and looking as angry as the d—l, all at one instant: certainly if Major POWERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the Witnesses interrogated.</NOTE> and the rest of them had not been as wily as himself and as brave as Caesar, he would have extorted some∣thing from them. But it was all labour lost: he never once re∣flected that the whiskey-boys wanted true and real representatives in Congress; none of your shams;—and that had they betrayed their candidates, a chamber in the Penitential House, or a hempen collar would have put them to the necessity of choosing others not quite so fit.</P>
<P>We come next to our author's elaborate defence of Irish ho∣nesty—a task equal in honor to that of Hercules, in cleans∣ing the Augean stable—but as I always hated lengthy calcula∣tions, and am sure I should soon grow tired of one applied to determine the exact number or proportion of Irishmen hanged in America, I leave this job to Porcupine. It is a national question, and I dare say he can determine with mathematical pre∣cision, whether our author's calculation be exact or not. In the meanwhile I will be so candid as to declare that we have more than a <HI>quantum sufficit</HI> both of English and Irish rogues among us; though the natives of Hibernia are vastly the most numerous. What is the precise cause of the difference; whether the English make a shift to hang most of their own rogues at home, and the Irish send theirs abroad, to propagate the breed, is hard for me to determine: but this I will say, for I love to give the devil his due, that, if war and justice must, for the good of mankind, have a certain number of victims in every country, we are most indebted to the Irish for our sacrifices: and as, of course, there is some merit in being shot or hanged, as well as in labouring for the benefit of the world, in this respect, Hibernia, the palm is thine!—The preceding view regards only the moral cha∣racter of the two nations, their propensities for picking of pock∣ets or cutting of throats, but it is necessary to do justice also to their respective political talents, which the reader will see, if he has patience, in the sequel.</P>
<P>Politics, however abstruse a science it was formerly esteemed,
<PB N="25" REF="030314_0023_0FE5B97A27FF26A8"/>
has been so thoroughly explored by modern essayists, and the knowledge has been so thoroughly disseminated by those laborious servants of the public, the editors of Gazettes, that every me∣chanic knows more now about civil rights and duties, than LOCKE, HARRINGTON, or SIDNEY. Every barber can tell you, to a hair's breadth, how far the line of submission goes, and where the right of insurrection begins; when the voice of the majority ought to govern, and when the minority have a right to interpose their <HI>veto;</HI> whether a government divided into three branches, or spreading, like a gooseberry bush, all into branch∣es, is best; whether the power of making treaties is superior to the power of breaking them, and whether they both exist to∣gether, like the principles of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> in the Magian the∣ology, always at loggerheads, or whether, like Castor and Pollux, they live and die by turns; how to manage the freedom of the press so that, like a cogged die, it shall always shew one side only; and a thousand other difficult and delicate questions, where the shades of right and wrong meet, and almost run into one another. Although the present war is a contest for power among the leaders, with the people at large it is a mere war of opinions, and has been as zealously maintained by the pen, as by the sword: rivers of ink as well as of blood have been spilt on the occasion. But when the king and ministry of Great Britain thought proper to check the ardour of one part of these quilled warriors, as somewhat dangerous to their own government, the party and its friends were so offended that they fled from England and Ireland, boiling hot with resentment. And now, courte∣ous reader, we come to discriminate the political characters of the two sorts of emigrants.</P>
<P>The exiles from England have not been as numerous as those from the sister Island; but what they have wanted in number, they have made up by superior qualifications for mischief. They are, generally speaking, pupils of the Parisian school, whole-blood Philosophers, who think of nothing but cutting the throats of all the kings in the world, and establishing an uni∣versal republic over the whole, or having it cantoned into a number of smaller confederacies: there are others again who have something that they call religion, in their heads, the mad disci∣ples
<PB N="26" REF="030314_0024_0FE5B97E83942EF8"/>
of BROTHERS, the mad prophet, and these look forward with joy to an approaching millenium. But however these two English sects of revolutionists differ in the object or end, they agree perfectly about the means. Two hundred years of destruction and misery, and an hundred millions of lives are nothing, if weighed in the balance against the extermination of Kings and Nobles. I have heard one of these enthusiasts re∣joicing that he had escaped from the tyranny of Great Britain, and saying that he looked forward with rapture to the period, when the tower of London will be in flames, and the kennels running with blood: nothing, he said, caused him so much regret, as the thought, that he had not distinguished himself, by cutting the King's throat, before he left England.</P>
<P>Now, I acknowledge that there are not many of the Irish patriots of this dreadful breed. They are mostly a mon∣grel race of reformers, neither so deeply skilled in politics, nor so very zealous about one form of government, more than another: they love liberty well enough, but could put up with a little tyranny, if the laws were not so d—d severe about the transfer of property; and to pay taxes for the support of those very laws they think is more than flesh and blood can bear. On the whole, I acknowledge that the English enthusiasts, whose heads in general are absolutely crazed, are much more to be dread∣ed than the patriots from Ireland. One of those blood coloured philosophers, with TOM PAINE'S <HI>Rights of Man</HI> in his hand, and a travelling guillotine by his side, would do more mischief in a month, than a brace of raggamuffins from Ireland, who only make free with a mans "horse or cow, from mere igno∣rance," would do in half a century.</P>
<P>Having now settled, with the utmost impartiality, this very important question between the two nations, for which I expect the thanks of the <HI>Emigration Society</HI> delivered by their Presi∣dent, I will take my leave of them both, with this friendly advice; "cease vilifying the country you sprung from, whatever or wherever it be, it is a mark of a base mind; and if you pre∣fer this, stay among us, and pursue some honest vocation with industry, leaving it to the natives to manage their own govern∣ment, to their own liking, as they understand it best." When
<PB N="27" REF="030314_0025_0FE5B98089042AA0"/>
a foreigner intermeddles with the politics of the country, he never fails to tinge it, as far as he is able, with his own national prejudices and attachments. If he has fled from the severity or justice of the laws of his former country, you discover his re∣sentment in every thing that he either says or does, that relates to it. Such a man, if he even prints a copy of an English work, cannot suffer it to pass through his hands, without trans∣fusing some of his gall against the nation or it's government, into his American edition. This not only betrays a mind, over∣flowing with the malignant passions, but is an insult to the reader, who does not pay his money to know the editor's politics, but to obtain information or entertainment from the author.— Such a person I have in my eye, who looking round a book store one day, in search of a book, that would answer to be reprint∣ed, at length made his choice, when this, or some such soli∣loquy took place:</P>
<P><Q>Mr. — said he, supposing the author to be present," you have published a very useful work, and may I add, in uni∣versal demand, of which I intend to print an American edi∣tion, with improvements. These improvements, except a few blunders of my own, shall consist principally of all the abuse I can invent against your nation, and your government, for I never can love, or forgive either of them. The thought of them only, makes my blood to boil. May ten thousand d—ls fly away with them all! just before I left — I had like to have lost my ears on a pillory, for only modestly exciting the people to cut one anothers throats.</Q></P>
<P>This national business dispatched, we will now attend to the claims of Master SWANWICK, and if I know my own mind, I intend to do him equal justice. It is of no importance to me, whether his father was a tide-waiter, or a waggon-master, or a Methodist teacher, or all three in one; whether the gentleman himself be the favorite of the ladies at t'other end of the town, or the topic of their diversion; whether he is content to mum∣ble orations in the Senate or boarding school, in humble prose, or diverts himself at the foot of Parnassus in prose run mad; whether he is most vain of his fine Italian marble, and rich
<PB N="28" REF="030314_0026_0FE5B981CDFE2740"/>
paintings, or of his palace, where as in the Indian temples, the meanest article of furniture, is the idol himself. I care not a farthing about all these things: they may all apply to a wise man or a fool, and in my estimation neither add nor subtract from the real merit of the man. It is Mr. SWANWICK, the re∣presentative in Congress, the bold and intrusive public character that I intend to examine.</P>
<P>The first time he commanded my notice, was when on the State-house ground in Philadelphia, he canvassed for a seat in the State legislature. This was an unusual sight: in all the elections for thirty years preceding I had never once seen a can∣didate, passing off his own ticket. In that space of time I had known some ambitious men, and many weak ones, soli∣citous for seats in the legislature, but modesty or some other old fashioned virtue generally kept them from the ground on the day of election, or if they attended, it was only as specta∣tors, leaving it to their friends and well-wishers to take care of their interest. How shall we account for this novelty? Shall we suppose him vain enough to think himself above the common rules of decorum, or stupid enough to despise them?</P>
<P>When by dint of art and industry he got into the house, it might have been expected that, as representative for the Metro∣polis, one of the greatest trading cities of the Union, in which he possessed a considerable real estate, and carried on an exten∣sive trade, her prosperity would be the principal object of his care. But Mr. SWANWICK had no head for speculations of this kind. The vanity of being of some consequence in the state, was more easily gratified, and by means at the same time less opposed to his ruling passion, avarice. In consequence of a quarrel with the stockholders in the Bank of <HI>North-America,</HI> his first step after he got into the Legislature was to obtain a charter for another Bank, under the auspices of the state. To effect this, he united himself with a predominant party in the house, which had always been adverse to the prosperity of the city and interior counties; and a large capital belonging to the state, was imbarked in the purchase of shares in the new Bank. By this measure he embraced two objects; the indulgence of his spleen against the ancient bank, and opening a large field
<PB N="29" REF="030314_0027_0FE5B9840FD0BC90"/>
for speculation as a subscriber, and afterwards as a director of the new; both which he has managed to great account. Thus the public money has been employed in the Jew trade of usu∣ry, in order to accommodate a few ambitious and daring spe∣culators; the commerce of city has not been enlarged by it, but engrossed by a few avaricious men, who were able to com∣mand discounts at any time, when others were refused. It is reported that some of these very directors have discounted notes at the extravagant rate of 3 pr. centum pr. month, with the very money they have obtained at the bank at 6 pr. cent. pr. annum.</P>
<P>The only honourable use of public money is public improve∣ments, the melioration of the roads, the construction of bridges, opening of inland navigation, and the establishment of a loan office: by these means the activity and benefits of the capital are diffused and felt through every part of the community, not confined, as it disgracefully has been, to a few avaricious indi∣viduals. Part of this same stock employed in the various ca∣nals, and turnpike roads would have given labour to many thousand hands, and enabled the farmer to carry his produce to market at a cheap rate, from the most distant parts; and ano∣ther part lodged in a loan office for the use of both the farmer, and the mechanic, would have enabled them to pay off their incumbrances, and advance their own and the general riches of the country.—</P>
<P>On the contrary, men of public spirit, who embarked in works of general utility, after spending large sums of their own money, have been reduced to the necessity either of losing all that they had expended, or applying to the legislature, for per∣mission to raise more by a lottery to compleat them. Thus a taste for gambling, only one degree above that of the Faro ta∣bles, has been sanctioned by law; and the people have been seduced from the honest pursuits of industry, by the tempta∣tion of making their fortunes by the turn of a wheel. And these things have taken place among men, who make a mighty parade about the necessity and benefits of public schools, and an improved education; as if it were possible to make virtuous ci∣tizens, merely by furnishing their heads with knowledge, while
<PB N="30" REF="030314_0028_0FE5B989126A85F8"/>
their hearts are poisoned with a spirit of gambling and idleness. Industry and temperance are the two cardinal virtues, on which the prosperity of a republic depends, and when they have fled, liberty and patriotism will soon follow, however scientifically men may learn to reason about them.</P>
<P>After this little puffing orator, by his crooked politics, and the assistance of his tramontane colleagues, had disgraced the commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a year or two, by some fa∣tality or other he was removed to the legislature of the United States. Here he pursued the same perverse system, and attach∣ed himself to that party in Congress, which had always oppos∣ed the Federal Constitution, and every salutary act of govern∣ment. His infamous conduct on the important question of the British treaty is so well known, that little more need be said a∣bout him. A volume cannot convey more than his own confes∣sion, when he said, Mr. MUHLENBURGH, who voted for the treaty had "saved his country" although he, himself had struggled with all his might, and even at last voted against it. Can words describe more detestable duplicity!—</P>
<P>From celebrating Irish honesty, the sincerity of Dr. FRANK∣LIN, and the transcendant merit of little Master SWANSKIN, the author passes, by a very natural transition, to calumniating the great and good President of the United States, the illustri∣ous founder of Pennsylvania, and the most virtuous citizens of the Union in a lump; and his pen is equally well adapted to both offices, as an insect gorged with filth from a dung-hill flies and drops it of choice on the whitest garment. "To be ill spoken of by such a man, is conferring that sort of honor, which it is alone within his competence, and which it is certainly most congenial to his nature and his manners to be∣stow"—as to receive praise from him is the surest proof that can be given, of inherent infamy in the object, on which it is be∣stowed.</P>
<P>It seems Dr. FRANKLIN chose to keep up the farce to the last. In his will he bequeathed a few trifling legacies, as me∣mentos of his friendship, or, if you like the stile of our au∣thor better, as proofs <HI>"of the goodness of his heart, and a wish to part in peace with all mankind."</HI> To the Philadelphia Libra∣ry,
<PB N="31" REF="030314_0029_0FE5B98AC91A71C0"/>
where his statue stands in the front, like the pale monu∣ment of Guilt, or like a Swiss at the door of an hotel, he gave one old sett of French works of little value; to the Pennsyl∣vania hospital, the balances of his unsettled accounts, provided the managers would undertake to <HI>pay,</HI> as well as to receive, which they prudently chose to decline; and to his worthy friend GEORGE WASHINGTON, he bequeathed his gold headed cane, surmounted with the cap of liberty, adding, "if it were a scep∣tre, he is worthy of it." From this last article, this <HI>candid</HI> wri∣ter infers, that the Doctor thought the President always held "a sceptre in higher estimation than a liberty cap," and if he really did, I should esteem it as a mark of his good sense: but it is very clear, from the only natural construction of the words, that the Doctor thought so himself—for however the <HI>Bonnet rouge</HI> may fit the head of an emancipated Frenchman, or the <HI>pileum</HI> suited the rabble of Rome, in celebrating their <HI>Saturna∣lia,</HI> and qualified every blackguard to insult a Metellus or a Cato, the old fox had more wit than to think that the modern liberty cap was a real badge of honor: No! no! he had carried it himself, only as a mask, and thought proper to qualify this sansculotte legacy to General WASHINGTON, by adding, "if it were a sceptre he is worthy of it." But to suppose that, be∣cause he thought the General worthy of a sceptre, as who is there that does not think so, he aspired to any higher dignity than that of President of the United States, is not only an in∣sult to the office, but betrays a soul overflowing with ingrati∣tude.</P>
<P>The whole of his life, the forty years of faithful services devoted to the good of his country; his retirement from the army at the close of the war, when a discontented soldiery, who idolized their general, would have given him a sceptre if he had chosen it; his present secession from the office of Chief Magistrate, with universal love and esteem, so completely dis∣prove this base insinuation, that it needs only to be mentioned, to excite general indignation against the author. But when it is known that this author is a foreigner by birth, every virtuous citizen will resolve, that such an ungrateful miscreant is unwor∣thy of an asylum among us, and be ready to chase him back to
<PB N="32" REF="030314_0030_0FE5B98C0A0F7C38"/>
the justice he fled from. It is not sufficient that these vermin find shelter and protection in the United States, but as soon almost as they come ashore, they fall to their old trade of abus∣ing government, as if the two could not exist together. The Jacobins of France, the Defenders and Peep o'Day Boys of Ireland, the Revolutionists of England, and the Democrats of America, form a band of Buccaniers, the sworn enemies of law and order, whom it behoves all good men to watch against, as a shepherd would against the approaches of a Wolf.</P>
<P>The following lines contain so good a description of our Imported Patriots, that I cannot resist the temptation to insert them here. They made their appearance in the <HI>Gazette of the United States</HI> about the time when these vermin first began to interfere in American politics; and have doubtless contributed, with other liberal publications, to draw down on the Editor, the bitter hatred of the party.</P>

<L>WITH every righteous government at odds,</L>
<L>I swear by all the goddesses and gods,</L>
<L>That wheresoever law and justice send me,</L>
<L>A restless disposition shall attend me.</L>
<L>The soil that gave me birth I found too hot,</L>
<L>And many a legal threshing there I got.</L>
<L>My mind a storm, I never could be quiet—</L>
<L>My only sustenance was mobs and riot—</L>
<L>Until a pack, with wigs and gowns and bands,</L>
<L>And arms so long, none could escape their hands,</L>
<L>To check the boiling of my patriot fury,</L>
<L>Condemn'd me by that bane of rogues, a jury;</L>
<L>But, thank kind fortune, I escap'd a jail,</L>
<L>And gave them for security—leg-bail</L>
<L>Free from their cursed gripe, to this blest shore,</L>
<L>A friendly bark my precious carcase bore.</L>

<P>After growling and gnashing his teeth against one of the greatest men living,—who is the glory and safeguard of his country, our Irish wolf attempts to root up the graves: the vir∣tues of both living and dead are his enemies, and he theirs. WILLIAM PENN, a name dear to all the <HI>real</HI> friends of civil and religious liberty, and venerated by the savage tribes to this very day, for his upright and peaceable conduct in the first set∣tlement of Pennsylvania, is treated with the same illiberal free∣dom as the great WASHINGTON: but it is natural, for ingrati∣tude will ever pursue distinguished merit as its evil genius, as long as envy exists in the world. Had this illustrious Quaker lived in the ancient ages of Greece, he would have been rank∣ed with the greatest benefactors of Mankind, with MINOS, SO∣LON and LYCURGUS: or had the Aborigines of this State been taught to believe in the existence of tutelary Spirits, they would have canonized <HI>Brother Onas,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indian name for WILLIAM PENN.</NOTE> as their guardian saint; and I believe in my soul they would have invoked him daily, to pro∣tect them against the red beards of Ireland, and all their attri∣bute vices and vermin.</P>
<P>There are some prominent features in the face of this sloven∣ly brat, which proue it incontestibly to be the offspring of an Irish daddy. The most striking are his frequent Hibernicisms, and a clumsy attempt to wit, very much like nonsense—yes, in∣deed Paddy, they are as much akin as two potatoes. These ad∣ded to the author's antipathy to the yankees, leave not the sha∣dow of a doubt as to his country: for the inhabitants of those
<PB N="34" REF="030314_0032_0FE5B992403AEDF0"/>
states, called Yankee, are generally attached to law and govern∣ment, of superior morals, and watchful of strangers that come among them: thieves and vagabonds don't thrive there: the air will poison them as quick as that of Ireland will a toad. Be∣sides, their select men encircle and guard their little societies, and an Irishman is as much afraid to enter the inclosure, as a wolf is to enter a circle of fire in the night time: so that there is no credit to be given, not the least, to what this lying varlet says of horse-stealing in Connecticut, or bundling in Massachu∣setts: they are only idle tales that he has picked up some where else, for take my word for it, reader, he has never been in either State.</P>
<P>Having now nearly done with this scribbler and his pamphlet, before I take my leave of him, I will just whisper in his ear a piece of wholesome advice in the style of the inimitable Cervantes: <Q>Let every man take care how he speaks or writes of honest peo∣ple, and not set down at a venture the first thing that comes into his joulter-head"—"Tell me, thou modern Sansculottes, and ancient rebel! was it thy province to dishonor and af∣front persons so worthy of reverence and respect. For the love of God, Paddy, set a guard upon thy tongue and thy pen, and behave so that the people may not discover by the thread, the coarse countryweb of which thou art woven. Consider, sinner, as thou art, and ruminate well, before thou offend in like sort again. Should I ever find thee hereafter mounted on a stage, like a quack-doctor, distributing thy poisonous <HI>pills</HI> among the people, I will give thee a stronger dose, bet∣ter adapted to thy coarse constitution and habit of body; one that will purge thee off thy legs, and make thee stink worse than a skunk pursued by the hounds.</Q></P>

<HEAD>RHAPSODY ON THE TIMES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LO! in these most accomplish'd times</L>
<L>How impudence can varnish crimes,</L>
<L>And prove, by syllogistic rule,</L>
<L>That turpitude is virtue's tool.</L>
<L>The Devil, prank'd in holy guise,</L>
<L>A cherub is to vulgar eyes;</L>
<L>And fortune-hunting folk agree</L>
<L>That lawless rage is liberty.</L>
<L>Thus oft they cause a compromise</L>
<L>'Twixt wrangling contrarieties:</L>
<L>Or, in the topsy turvy cause,</L>
<L>Invert both offices and laws:</L>
<L>As Irish logic never fails</L>
<L>To geer draught-horses by their tails.</L>
<L>Hence bold reformers make appear</L>
<L>That <HI>Prudence</HI> is a name for <HI>Fear;</HI></L>
<L>That <HI>Rapine, Sacrilege,</HI> and <HI>Treason,</HI></L>
<L>Do constitute the <HI>Age of Reason;</HI></L>
<L>That gentle love is deadly spite;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="030314_0035_0FE5B99925358728"/>That right is wrong, and wrong is right;</L>
<L>And clear, beyond belief of some,</L>

<L>Hence, in this period of reform,</L>

<L>Or, bless'd with paper-spoiling skill,</L>
<L>Transfuse their madness thro' a quill:</L>
<L>Secure of coming in for shares,</L>

<L>And make, of unsuspecting elves,</L>

<L>To Athens swiftly they repair</L>
<L>To cull for her a laurel there,</L>
<L>And pass her on the giddy throng,</L>
<L>For a fresh beauty fair and young.</L>
<L>But lo! beneath her placid mien</L>
<L>The fiend licentiousness is seen:</L>
<L>See frantic horror at her side,</L>
<L>Her hands with guiltless blood bedy'd,</L>
<L>And, ill conceal'd by sophist art,</L>

<L><PB N="8" REF="030314_0039_0FE5B9441DBC4A18"/>Yet did he live; but in what year?</L>
<L>No matter, so the rest is clear.</L>
<L>He was a man, on truth 'tis founded,</L>
<L>Of every evil thing compounded.</L>
<L>His brain, an emblem of foul weather,</L>
<L>Where jarring atoms fight together,</L>
<L>Was copied in the smallest print:</L>
<L>His mental optics look'd asquint,</L>
<L>And, to the fashion of his eye,</L>
<L>The thoughts were couple'd so awry,</L>
<L>That oft his words, a motley crew,</L>
<L>Most whimsically squinted too.</L>
<L>A beast he was of such a grain</L>
<L>No switch could move, or bit restrain,</L>
<L>In legal sense; but in a fray,</L>
<L>If cudgel'd well, he ran away.</L>
<L>The laws, he thought, were ever meant,</L>
<L>As certain bars to his preferment;</L>
<L>For 'twas his fortune still to stray,</L>
<L>And keep the interdicted way.</L>
<L>Thus, if a wish to pilfer rose,</L>
<L>Justice, good wench, would interpose,</L>
<L>By twitching him beneath the ear,</L>
<L>As who should say, beware! beware!</L>
<L>Whene'er he sought a fresh supply,</L>
<L>She like a halter rattle'd by;</L>
<L>And oft', when Paddy would proceed,</L>
<L>She cuff'd him soundly for the deed.</L>
<L>The Constitution too he saw</L>
<L>Was Parent of the smallest law;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="030314_0040_0FE5B94625E33030"/>Which guarded her, from head to heel,</L>
<L>Like Wantley's Knight, with pikes of steel;</L>
<L>And made our hero own, by styx,</L>

<L>Thence was it that he daily sent</L>
<L>His curses forth on Parliament;</L>
<L>And, from his soul abominated</L>
<L>The King, and all to him related.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE inward man, one might discern,</L>
<L>Was Prototype to the extern,</L>
<L>Which, take it altogether, could</L>
<L>Not boast two members of a mould.</L>
<L>Thus edified, and thus endow'd,</L>
<L>Our brave Turf-cutter took the road,</L>
<L>To where a dark cabal resorted,</L>
<L>And thus the yelping pack exhorted;</L>

<L>He would, to mend Miss Luna's case,</L>
<L>Spread glowing blushes in her face;</L>

<L>He'd rend away his flaming robe,</L>

<L>Thus as, sublim'd, his transport went</L>
<L>E'en to the acmé of content,</L>
<L>Mad Pat, to pad the hoof once more,</L>
<L>Of freedom landed on the shore.</L>
<L>But folly, wheresoe'er inclin'd,</L>

<L>He came from Ireland all the way.</L>
<L>With thread-bare saws, and oaths unmatch'd,</L>
<L>His stupid gab was all o'er patch'd.</L>
<L>To cry the British Min'stry down,</L>
<L>He thought it stood him much upon;</L>
<L>For which his tainted brain was stor'd</L>
<L>With many a senseless magpie word:</L>
<L>And, storming on, with might and main,</L>
<L>He rail'd, took breath, and rail'd again.</L>
<L>Thus it is that patriots prate,</L>

<L>Of politics; when in their gears</L>

<L>That watch, however you came by't,</L>
