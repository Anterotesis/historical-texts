<P>THE <HI>woful</HI> practice of calling evil good, and good evil; of putting dark∣ness for light, and light for darkness, bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter, has been the main source of delusion and slavery in all ages. <HI>Isai. v, 20.</HI> But, as it has now involved the world in very great perplexities, it is hoped that this brief essay, to open the nature and evi∣dence of <HI>CHRISTIANITY,</HI> will be candid∣ly received; and that our dear Country∣men will be as noble as the Bereans were; and search the scriptures daily for light in this matter, which is of infinite con∣cernment to us all.</P>

<P>And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophecy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE most important events, from the a∣postolic age to the end of time, are exact∣ly described in this book; among which the affair of these two witnesses has a pe∣culiar place. Who they are, why called two and no more, how they prophecy, and the effects thereof, are questions which have puzzled many, and have caused much controversy. Such darkness has at∣tended it, that many serious minds have been for avoiding any concern therewith. But since a bles∣sing is pronounced upon those who shall read and hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein, how can any be willing to disregard such blessedness? Therefore, with earn∣est desires after it, let us attempt a brief answer to the above inquiries.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHO are these two witnesses? In the words following we are told, that they are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the
<PB N="4" REF="019485_0004_0FABAEE15A2B0538"/>God of the earth. This refers to the state of the church soon after her return from Babylon. That return was encouraged and promoted by the civil power; but when her enemies, by false accusations, procured a counter order from thence, the Jews ne∣glected the house of God, and pursued their own private concerns. Thus they went on for a num∣ber of years, and then the prophets Haggai and Ze∣chariah, were sent to reprove and expostulate with them for this iniquity, and to call them to repen∣tance and reformation; to promote which, a can∣dlestick, all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and an olive-tree on each side, was set before one of these prophets. And upon his enquiring what it meant, the answer was, "This is the <HI>word of the Lord</HI> unto Zerubbable, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by <HI>my Spirit,</HI> saith the Lord of hosts: who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubba∣ble thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth the head-stone thereof with shouting, crying, <HI>grace, grace,</HI> unto it." Zech. iv. 2—7.</P>
<P>THE work they were called to, was to build the house of God; the mountain in the way of it was the opposition of the world; Zerubbable was their governor, whom the spirit of God would carry through all difficulties so as to finish his house, and free grace should have all the glory. The candle∣stick represented the church of God, the oil his gra∣cious influence, and the two olive-trees the medi∣cines through which it was communicated; for they <HI>emptied the golden oil out of themselves,</HI> ver. 12. So says our Lord, <HI>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth,</HI> John xvii. 17. Among his ancient people oil was made use of for food, for medicine, for ornament, for consecration, and for light, espe∣cially in their tabernacle and temple.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019485_0005_0FABAEE2249EEC78"/>
THE Manna which was their food for forty years in the wilderness, tasted like <HI>fresh oil;</HI> and it was to make them know, that man doth not live by bread only, but <HI>by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</HI> Num. xi. 8. Deut. viii. 3. Mat. iv. 4. Every word of his feeds the soul, when re∣ceived by faith. Oil was also of a kind and healing nature, and for that end was poured into the wounds of the man who fell among thieves; and of how much greater efficacy is grace to wounded con∣sciences? Oil likewise made their faces to shine; which was but a shadow of the <HI>beauties of holiness</HI> that shine in willing converts. Psalm civ. 15. cx. 3. Anointing was required in all their consecrations. The tabernacle, and all its rich furniture, with the priests who ministered therein, were consecrated in this way: and oil had a special place in their pub∣lic offerings. Yea, with an horn of oil David was anointed king over the Israel of God; all which were shadows of the head and members of the Christian church, that spiritual house, that holy and royal priesthood. 1 Pet. ii. 5, 9. Rev. i. 5, 6. And the oil for light, in the Jewish tabernacle and tem∣ple, represented the influences of the holy Spirit, whereby the gospel church is made the light of the world, and the pillar and ground of the truth. Mat. v. 14. 1 Tim. iii. 15, 16.</P>
<P N="2">II. BUT why are these witnesses called two and no more? In Zechariah's time there was but one testament, as well as one church; what then was in∣tended by the two olive-trees? Answer, The occa∣sion and design of witnesses is to prove points of im∣portance which are disputed, especially in the affairs of government: and all such disputes in our world came in by calling in question the truth and equity of God's revealed will, whereby all ought to be go∣verned.
<PB N="6" REF="019485_0006_0FABAEE2F3896BA0"/>And for him to foretel exactly the future actions of moral agents, and his just dealings towards them; and then clearly to record the accomplish∣ment of those predictions, with the verification of his promises and threatenings, are the strongest evi∣dences that can be given, of his right to govern the world, and that he governs it right.</P>
<P>HENCE he warns all against fearing any man as his prophet, whose prophecy does not follow or come to pass. And Christ is there promised as the ante∣type of Moses, who must be <HI>heard in all things,</HI> up∣on the penalty of being <HI>destroyed from among the people.</HI> Deut. xviii. 18—22. Acts iii. 22, 23. And to these two witnesses, of express predictions, and their exact accomplishment, he makes his ap∣peal against the brazen obstinacy, and wilful treach∣ery of the Jews, who were transgressors from the womb. Isai. xlviii. 1—8. His prophets were mortal, but their words were not so. Many of them were verified in the Babylonish captivity, and to expose the folly of unbelief and disobedience in those who returned from it, he said, <HI>My words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they re∣turned and said, Like as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us,</HI> Zech. i. 6. They acknowledged that his words were truth, and also that they were according to justice and equity; so that here were two olive-trees, two witnesses, when there was but one church. And how much deep∣er root did these trees take when our Saviour came, and fulfilled the law, both moral and ceremonial, and accomplished all the prophecy concerning him, which had been published from time to time for four thousand years?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019485_0007_0FABAEE39CCC5468"/>
HE was first promised as the seed of the woman, then of Abraham, then of Judah, then of David, in whose line was Zerubbable, the builder of the second temple; and the promise of his being made <HI>as a signet,</HI> pointed directly to Christ, the precious corner stone in Zion. Hag. ii. 23. Acts iv. 11. Matthew has proved that Joseph was the legal heir to David's crown, and Luke has traced the line from Mary up to David, whose family was reduced so low as not to be able to provide a lamb, even when the Son of God was publicly presented in his house; a greater glory than ever appeared in the temple built by Solomon. That they were so poor is evident, because the birds then brought were not allowed of, when the first-born was presented, but only in case of inability to provide a lamb. Levi. xii. 6, 8. Luke ii. 24. Well then did the prophet say, <HI>Who hath believed our report?—for he shall grow up as a root out of a dry ground.</HI> Who could believe that a child thus born could be the mighty God, the Mes∣siah so often spoken of, who should conquer all his enemies, and establish an everlasting kingdom! None ever did believe it but such as were <HI>taught of God.</HI> John vi. 44, 45.</P>
<P>DAVID was so taught, and thereby was led ex∣actly to foretel the rage of Jews and Gentiles against Christ; his being betrayed by a professed friend, and having his hands and feet pierced, and gall and vinegar given him by his enemies; his last prayer to the Father; his resurrection, ascen∣tion, and session at the Father's right-hand, with his glorious gifts to his people, and vengeance on his impenitent foes. Psalm ii. 1—12. xvi. 10, 11. xxii. 1, 16. xli. 9. xlv. 1—7. lxviii. 17—21. lxix. 21. cx. 1—6. All which, with innumera∣ble other predictions, were exactly verified in Jesus
<PB N="8" REF="019485_0008_0FABAEE4C6033328"/>Christ; so that though John, who came to prepare his way, was a burning and shining light, yet his greatest <HI>witnesses</HI> were the <HI>works,</HI> which were fore∣told by the Father, and finished by the Son. John v. 36. viii. 17, 18. The apostles explained the pro∣phets, and recorded the perfect accomplishment of their predictions, and also the laws and orders of the gospel church; and upon this foundation <HI>both</HI> Jews and Gentiles had access by <HI>one Spirit</HI> unto the Fa∣ther, and <HI>both</HI> partook of the <HI>root and fatness of the olive-tree.</HI> Eph. ii. 18—22. Rom. xi. 6, 17. Thus the two candlesticks appear to be the old and new testament churches, and the two olive-trees, the special laws and institutions given to each of them, through which God communicated his grace. Twelve patriarchs constituted the first, and twelve apostles the last of these churches; and their union is undoubtedly represented by the twenty-four el∣ders whom John saw. The apostles were set before the prophets, as their true interpreters, in the first building of the Christian church, and so they will be in her triumph over Babylon. Rev. v. 8, 9. xviii. 20.</P>
<P N="3">III. HOW do these witnesses still prophecy, since the volume of inspiration is compleated? Answer, As the nature and order of the first creation, the pri∣mitive state of man, his fall, and the only way of recovery, as well as the future state of rewards and punishments, could not have been clearly known by him without pure revelation, so none can preach these great articles aright without the <HI>spirit of faith.</HI> Those who are <HI>in the flesh, cannot please God. If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 13. Rom. viii. 8, 9. The gos∣pel ministry is committed to none but <HI>faithful men.</HI> To such only does he say, <HI>Lo I am with you alway,
<PB N="9" REF="019485_0009_0FABAEE66E84DFE0"/>even unto the end of the world.</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 1, 2. Mat. xxviii. 20. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they speak unto men to edification, and exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tion, and comfort, they <HI>prophecy;</HI> and thereby the secrets of unbelievers hearts are made manifest, and they are turned from sin to God. And each person so turned, hath the <HI>witness in himself</HI> of the eternal truth of the <HI>re∣cord</HI> which God hath given of his Son, while others charge him with <HI>lying</HI> therein. 1 Cor. xiv. 3, 24, 25. 1 John v. 9, 10. And as with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, so with the mouth con∣fession is made unto salvation; and saints receive one another as Christ receives them, to the glory of God. They first <HI>give themselves</HI> to him, and then unto the church <HI>by his will.</HI> Rom. x. 10. xv. 7. 2 Cor. viii. 5. Which is the exact nature of a gos∣pel covenant; and it can no more be the duty of any soul to keep any covenant contrary to the revealed will of God, than it can to fear man instead of him. And these spiritual weapons were more extensively victorious in the apostolic age, than the Roman sword had ever been. And as God has ever go∣verned the world with a special regard to his elect, in and by whom his witnesses are held up, so their cries have procured blessings or plagues upon the earth, as often and as far as their wills have been one with his will. 1 John v. 14, 15. Luke xviii. 7, 8. James v. 17, 18. Also the light which they have held up, has been terrible to guilty consciences; therefore they are truly said to smite the earth with plagues as often as they will, and to torment its in∣habitants. Context, ver. 5, 6, 10.</P>
<P N="4">IV. WHY do these witnesses prophecy so long in sackcloth? Answer, Because the beast bears sway all that time; only his reckoning is by months, and theirs by days. Rev. xi. 2, 3. xiii. 5. His king∣dom
<PB N="10" REF="019485_0010_0FABAEE6E74E2628"/>was founded in darkness, while they are the children of light; and months are named from the moon, which rules the night, as the sun does the day. The ceremonial law put a specialty upon e∣very new moon; but when Christ came he took that hand-writing out of the way, nailing it to his cross, and warned his church against being brought into bondage, under those weak and beggarly elements, by <HI>deceitful philosophy,</HI> and the <HI>commandments of men.</HI> Gal. iv. 9.10. Col. ii. 8—23. The fun∣damental order of his kingdom is, that none <HI>can see it,</HI> nor have any right to <HI>power</HI> in it, until they are <HI>born again;</HI> and also that all striving about who shall be the <HI>greatest,</HI> is excluded therefrom. John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. Matt. xviii. 3, 4. xx. 24—27. Lordship one over another is here declared to be of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and by them is the holy city trodden under foot the forty and two months wherein the witnesses prophecy in sackcloth; which has ever caused mourning in themselves, and their being des∣pised by others. And mourning in themselves, and being despised by the world, are undoubtedly the ideas intended by that cloathing. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that as∣cendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them, and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies, three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two pro∣phets tormented them who dwelt on the earth. Rev. xi. 2, 3, 7—10.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="019485_0011_0FABAEE9F33D89D8"/>
AND how exactly does this describe the present state of things through the world? How is <HI>truth fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter?</HI> A dead body or form of it is kept above ground, but how is its life and influence shut out by men in power? This city is so large as to include the place where our Lord was crucified; which was done by the ac∣cusations of church officers, enforced by the secular arm. And within this city will be found all the blood which has been shed under the Christian name. It is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt. The spirit of Sodom was pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness; neither did they strengthen the hands of the poor and needy, but were haughty and daring in their abominations be∣fore God. Ezek. xvi. 49, 50. Egypt reaped great advantages by the Israelites; but turned them all to gratify their own lusts, and most cruelly to oppress the very people from whom they derived those advantages. And how full is the word of this spirit in our day!</P>
<P>THE beast that overcame and killed the witnesses, came out of the bottomless pit. In his first form he arose out of the sea, and in his second he arose out of the earth; but then he exercised all the pow∣er of the first beast. He was as spotted as a leo∣pard, as cruel as a bear, and as terrible as a lion; yet he was very changeable. He was, and is not, and yet is. He is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. Rev. xiii. 1—12. xvii. 8—11.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Roman empire was the greatest beast in the world. Dan. vii. 7, 8. His heads appear to be different forms of their commanding power. Kings, consuls, dictators, decem∣virs, and tribunes, were all fallen before the apostle wrote, when pagan emperors ruled; and Christian emperors ruled but a short time, before the <HI>little horn,</HI> the bishop of Rome, assumed the command over all the churches; to whom the ten horns gave their power. This <HI>eighth is of the seven;</HI> for his arbitrary power, which he carried to an amazing length, was enforced by the sword of the magistrate, which was first brought into the church by Constantine; and this practice was of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by whom the holy city has been trodden under foot.</NOTE> Now compare these characters with plain
<PB N="12" REF="019485_0012_0FABAEEB745402E8"/>facts. Christ commands his servants to let the children of the wicked one, grow together with his children, in the world, until the end of it; while he commands his church to put away wicked per∣sons from among them. Mat. xiii. 30, 38. 1 Cor. v. 12, 13. But leopards, bears and lions, are not more opposite to the tender feelings of humanity, than many are to this liberty and purity. When the only true head of the church was desired to in∣terpose his influence in the division of an estate, he said, <HI>Man, who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</HI> And he commanded his ministers to depart out of every city, where his gospel was not <HI>freely</HI> received, and not <HI>forcibly</HI> to carry away so much as the dust of their feet. Luke x. 7—12. xii. 14. But all earthly heads of the church have ever done the contrary.</P>
<P>THE head of the church of Rome arose out of the raging confusions of the Roman empire, by a mystical confounding of Jewish ceremonies with Christian worship, which is as bottomless as the ocean; and he assumed the power of <HI>dividing</HI> all the world among his votaries. No sooner was our American world discovered, than he, the very next spring, presumed to dispose of it in as ample man∣ner, by a formal deed, as any man could of his
<PB N="13" REF="019485_0013_0FABAEEBDF4CEC98"/>farm. And when temporal princes were set up as heads of the church, they exercised the same power. In each nation, their head, which arose out of the earth, set up by the people, like a harmless lamb, yet spake like a dragon, under the influence of the two horns, of church censures and corporal punish∣ments. All our American charters were given from that power; and from thence came our late most cruel war. The society in London who sent their missionaries into our colonies, had an annual sermon delivered before them, by the bishop of Glocester, on Feb. 21, 1766, wherein he said, "The spreading of GENTILEISM in the colonies, calls for our rejected charity."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Glocester's sermon, p. 11.</NOTE> And the next month it was resolved in Parliament, that they had a right to BIND US IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER.—And before said society, on Feb. 20, 1767, the bishop of Landaff accused the inhabitants of these colonies of being "infidels and barbarians;" which, said he, "was contrary to the pretences and <HI>condi∣tions</HI> under which they obtained <HI>royal grants</HI> and public authority." And after expressing his desires and hopes of the speedy establishment of bishops here, he said, "This point obtained, the Ameri∣can church will soon go out of its infant state, be able to stand upon its own legs, and without foreign help <HI>support</HI> and spread itself. Then the business of this society will have been brought to the happy issue <HI>intended."</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Landaff's sermon, p. 7, 24, 25.</NOTE> And the tea act, which brought on the war, was passed that year. Thus all the <HI>blood</HI> that was shed therein, was procured by the ac∣cusations of church officers, enforced by the sword.</P>
<P>AND we are to remember, that the beast which John saw had a mouth like a lion; a beast that goes
<PB N="14" REF="019485_0014_0FABAEED793EDC88"/>forth to seek his prey in the night, and does it by sitting up a dreadful roar, and then listening for the noise of creatures in their flight, and pursuing them by the ear and not the eye; for when the morning cometh they retire into their dens. Psalm civ. 20—22. So, in a very dark time, twenty thousand mercenaries were brought from Germany, to add terror to the roarings of the British lion, who blind∣ly pursued his prey, from the lofty mountains of Ca∣nada, to the plains and thickets of Carolina and Georgia, but could not catch it. Yet this bloody chace was no sooner over, than the merchants of Baby∣lon, even the <HI>great men of the earth,</HI> filled this coun∣try with her splendid and costly wares; by means of which public credit, or the faith of government in America, has been bought and sold for a trifle. And the spirit of pride and luxury, like Sodom, and of tyranny, like Egypt, has prevailed amazingly. No effectual care was taken to secure a medium of trade among us, and yet public and private debts are demanded with great rigour; as if brick could be made without straw. Yet hereby the word of God is verified, which is infinitely more precious than gold.</P>
<P>UNDER the plausible pretences of religion and government, the worst of evils have long been co∣vered among all nations; but God has promised to destroy this covering, and to reveal and consume the man of sin, by the spirit of his mouth, and the bright∣ness of his appearing. Isai. xxv. 7.2 Thess. ii. 3—12. Towards which he has now made great advances. Calling in question the truth and equi∣ty of God's revealed will, and sitting up the inven∣tions and will of man against it, was the way where∣by sin and death came into our world. The first Adam, our public head, revolted from heaven, and
<PB N="15" REF="019485_0015_0FABAEEE1CB5EE08"/>seized upon the earth as his own; and we all bear his earthly image, until we are born again, and so are changed into the image of our second head, the Lord from heaven. Rom. v. 12—21. 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22, 47—49. To prepare whose way several eminent men were raised up, in different ages; as Noah, to save the human race from compleat de∣struction by the deluge, and Abraham, to be the father of the church of Israel; each of whom were eminent types of Christ, as Moses also was of his prophetical, Aaron of his priestly, and David of his kingly offices. But in the antichristian apostacy, the veil of the ceremonial law was drawn over the truth and glory of the gospel. The covenant of cir∣cumcision, which Jesus had nailed to his cross, was taken from thence, and called the covenant of grace; from whence it was declared that dominion is found∣ed in grace. Common believers were put in the place of Noah and Abraham, and officers in the place of Moses, Aaron and David; and a successive power in officers has been held up as a sacred thing ever since. Teachers procured the crucifixion of our Lord, by saying, <HI>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend;</HI> and an appeal to the <HI>king's laws,</HI> has been the refuge of hirelings in every age: But how has God now rent away this veil of darkness?</P>
<P>FOR no man can claim any power in our govern∣ment that was not lately derived from the consent of the people, without appearing an enemy to his country; and this authority is acknowledged to be good by the greatest Princes in Europe. And <HI>money</HI> forms the only qualification of the electors of our highest rulers; and it was a <HI>sorcerer</HI> who first offered <HI>money</HI> for <HI>power</HI> in the Christian church; and by such <HI>sorceries</HI> the whore of Babylon has <HI>deceived
<PB N="16" REF="019485_0016_0FABAEEED9055988"/>all nations.</HI> Acts viii. 18—21, Rev. xviii. 23. Yet many in our country still call themselves mini∣sters of Christ, who refuse to be governed by him, and insist upon being supported by secular <HI>force.</HI> Under the law God called such the <HI>sons of Belial,</HI> and poured his vengeance on them and their fol∣lowers; and the way wherein he has promised to bring wars to an end, is by exalting <HI>his house</HI> above all earthly powers, and drawing the nations <HI>freely</HI> to obey <HI>his laws,</HI> enforced in <HI>his name.</HI> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. Micah iii. 5—12. iv. 1—5. Col. iii. 17. Multitudes are so averse to this, as clearly to verify the prophecy of Jude, who says, <HI>Wo unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</HI> In each of which cases man is to be seen rejecting the authority of God, and exalting self above him.</P>
<P>ELECTION is an honorable word with them, when applied to particular men, whose <HI>persons they have in admiration because of advantage;</HI> but when God makes use of the same word, to display the glories of his grace, men discover a perfect enmity against it. Like Cain, they would be accepted without faith in the blood of atonement; and because God gave Abel that faith, and had respect to him and his offering in that way, Cain had a bloody rage a∣gainst him; <HI>because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</HI> Heb. xi. 4. 1 John iii. 12. As Cain was the elder brother, and govern∣ment was then in families; Abel was still a good subject and never injured Cain in any respect by his having the true religion. Gen. iv. 7. Neither did true religion ever injure any man in the world; and yet what enmity have many against it! Balaam knew that God had <HI>chosen</HI> Israel for his peculiar

<P>THE church is presented as a chaste virgin to Christ, unto whom none can be married, until, by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, they are made dead to sin and self-righteousness, and alive to God; which great change is openly declared in baptism; and it is <HI>adultery</HI> for any to profess to be his in any other way. Rom. vi. 2—4. vii. 1—6. Before this change we all love the creature above the Cre∣ator; and to go after any but him for temporal com∣forts, is <HI>playing</HI> the <HI>harlot.</HI> Coveteousness is <HI>idola∣try;</HI> and many make a <HI>god of their belly.</HI> Hosea ii. 5—8.

Which is the exact language of all teachers who refuse to be governed by the laws of Christ, the only antitype of Moses and Aaron. They rule the church with <HI>force and cruelty,</HI> and trample down the good pastures, and foul the deep waters with their feet. That is, they corrupt the word of God, and try all arts to darken every thing therein which condemns their deceit and cruelty. And our only way of deliverance from such <HI>evil
<PB N="18" REF="019485_0018_0FABAEF05C616568"/>beasts,</HI> is the way of faith in and obedience to our spiritual David. Ezek. xxxiv. 4, 18—25. Un∣der the law he gave his people rest, on the seventh day, in the seventh year, and after seven times seven years; and under the gospel he first gives them rest, and then they work for him. Heb. iv. 1—10.

Beasts act according to their carnal inclina∣tions, without any regard to truth or equity; and so do those who empower some to judge for others about religious worship, and to enforce their judge∣ments with the sword. This beast has often chang∣ed his name and appearance, upon which the cry has been, <HI>Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</HI> And when his fraud has been detected, and his power defeated, he has soon assumed another name and form, and then has pursued the same argument. Thus he was, and is not, and yet is; though he shall finally go into perdition. Rev. xiii. 4. xvii. 8. And how earnest should all be for this great event? For then all will know, that reli∣gion never gives officers a right to the property of the people for nothing, nor the people a right to re∣quire officers to go a warfare of their own charges; and also that no birth or doings of nature can give any soul a right to the promises of grace, without personal faith therein.

<P>NONE can be built upon the Rock without hear∣ing and doing the <HI>sayings</HI> of Christ; and his sayings demonstrate, that the only heirs of the blessings of his kingdom, are the poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, such as hunger and thirst after righteous∣ness,

Mat. v. 3—12. vii. 6, 12, 15, 24. Hence it is certain, that the distinction between his church and the world, is not <HI>carnal</HI> but <HI>spiritual.</HI> The bloody sign of circum∣cision was a seal to Abraham, of the faith he before had in Christ, in whom all the families of the earth shall be blessed. A descent from Abraham by blood, or a purchase with his money, were sha∣dows of the purchase of Christ's blood, and of re∣generation by his grace. But since his death, at∣tempts to build his church upon the covenant of circumcision is <HI>falling from grace.</HI> The <HI>natural</HI> distinctions which it made among mankind, could not be countenanced by Peter nor Barnabas without <HI>dissimulation.</HI> Rom. iv. 10—12. Gal. ii. 12, 13. v. 1—4. For by that covenant Abraham could not circumcise any Gentile, until he had bought him as a servant with money; neither could he re∣tain any such in his house without circumcising him. Kings were to come out of him, and his seed were to take the land of Canaan by the sword, when the iniquity of its inhabitants should be <HI>full,</HI> of which God was the sole judge. Gen. xv. 16. xvii. 6—14. David was the king who finished that conquest, but for the wickedness of his posterity the <HI>crown</HI> was taken from them, and was <HI>overturned, overturned, overturned,</HI> until Jesus came, and it was given to him. Ezek. xxi. 25—27. Luke i. 32. And he says to his disciples, <HI>Circumcision is nothing, and uncir∣cumcision
<PB N="20" REF="019485_0020_0FABAEF593325650"/>is nothing, but the keeping of the command∣ments of God. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the servants of men. One is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren.</HI> And those who laid heavy burdens on mens shoulders, which they would not move with one of their fingers, he called <HI>serpents and a generation of vipers.</HI> 1 Cor. vii. 19, 23. Mat. xxiii. 2—8, 33.</P>
<P>AND how full is our world of such at this time! Boston now imitates Jerusalem herein, for no man in Boston has ever been compelled to support any religious teacher contrary to his personal choice, since 1693; while her teachers and lawyers have resolutely denied this liberty to the country, and have claimed a power to compel every parish to settle and support such teachers as they have called orthodox. And at the commencement of our new Constitution, this practice was called GODLINESS, in capitals, while <HI>honesty</HI> was put in small letters. And a door was left open for the admission of Roman catholics into the highest offices in our government: to justify which, it was said, "Religion must at all times be a matter between God and individuals."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Address before the Massachusetts Constitution, 1780, p. 17.</NOTE> Since which one of their most noted teachers, has published a book in London, wherein he carries his notions of the gift of grace so high as to say, "Infallibly, if the greater part of the human kind, notwithstanding this gift, and the <HI>abounding</HI> of it, are left to perish eternally, in consequence of the lapse through Adam, a broader foundation is really laid for their groaning under the damage by him, than for their rejoicing in the opposite advantage derived to the world through Jesus Christ." And he holds forth that personal doings and sufferings,
<PB N="21" REF="019485_0021_0FABAEF59F2B89B8"/>either here or hereafter, will bring every child of Adam to virtue and eternal happiness; for, says he, "In what point of light soever we take a view of sin, it is certainly, in its nature, a <HI>finite evil.</HI>—And the consideration of <HI>hell</HI> as a <HI>purging fire,</HI> is that only which can make the matter sit easy upon one's mind—This is certainly most agreeable to the <HI>natural notions</HI> we entertain of the only <HI>good</HI> God.—Nor can I suppose that any soberly thoughtful <HI>Deist</HI> would ever have recurred to <HI>mere reason,</HI> in opposition to <HI>revelation,</HI> for the support of a <HI>hope</HI> towards God, if he had entertained this idea of its design and ten∣dency."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chauncy on Salvation for all men, 1784, p. 85, 87, 319, 324, 325, 361.</NOTE> And who can describe the joys that have been among the nations, upon the opening of such a door!

<P>BECAUSE Noah was a gracious man, and the saving of his house in the ark was a figure of our being saved by baptism; and because Abraham was a gra∣cious man, whose houshold constituted the Hebrew church, and were commanded by him to keep the way of the Lord, good men have imagined that re∣ligion would fail from among them, if their infants were not baptized. But the experience of four times forty years in New-England, has entirely destroyed the covering of this iniquity. Our Plymouth fa∣thers held that the church was INDEPENDENT of the world, and to be governed wholly by the laws of Christ: But the massachusetts rejected that name, and called the church CONGREGATIONAL. They both held that none had any right to a governing power in the church but <HI>regenerate persons;</HI> and that all office power is derived from Christ, by his word and Spirit, to each particular church, and not
<PB N="23" REF="019485_0023_0FABAEF7790C62A8"/>by any local succession from any other men in the world. And our Plymouth fathers held, that each church was to act as a united body, their votes be∣ing equal; but the Massachusetts held that no church act was compleat without the consent of the elders, and that rulers ought to compel the people to sup∣port them. After forty years, they allowed the chil∣dren of godly parents to be active in baptism, with∣out any account of <HI>their regeneration.</HI> At the close of the second period such were also allowed to come to the ordinance of the supper, as a converting or∣dinance. But an extensive revival of religion, at the close of the third period, brought many to the knowledge of the <HI>new birth,</HI> which alarmed hire∣lings; and the land has been filled with controver∣sy ever since. The year 1780, compleated four times forty years, since New-England was planted; and it was a remarkable year of <HI>grace</HI> to many, and also of evidence that the name does not belong to the covenant of circumcision.</P>
<P>ISRAEL were not to set up any rulers over them, but <HI>brethren</HI> in their church; and adultery and blas∣phemy were capital crimes among them. There∣fore all but communicants in congregational church∣es, were excluded from any vote in the Massachu∣setts government, the spring after Boston was plant∣ed. And they enacted the next year, "That if any man have carnal copulation with another man's wife, they shall both be punished with death."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince's annals, p. 28, 35.</NOTE> And they hanged a number of persons for adultery, many years before they did any for heresy. When they lost their charter, their scheme of compelling the world to submit to the government of the church, was destroyed; and the world, by the help of mini∣sters,
<PB N="24" REF="019485_0024_0FABAEF921976D20"/>have tyranized over the church in New-Eng∣land ever since.</P>
<P>A CHURCH on our western borders holds that "Infant baptism is administered in a view of the <HI>parents being in covenant;</HI> but doth not suppose the <HI>infant itself,</HI> to be possessed of <HI>any right</HI> whatever, to the privileges of the covenent of grace." That their children, as well as others, are born <HI>under the curse;</HI> and that parents are under covenant obliga∣tion to train them up in the nurture and admoni∣tion of the Lord. Therefore when a man came from Connecticut, who had been heard to blaspheme his Maker, and made suit to a young widow in their church, who had children under their care, they warned her not to marry him; and because she did it, they excluded her from their communion. But for this, the terms, <HI>grace, saving grace,</HI> were dressed up in a most ridiculous manner, and were thus held forth to the world, from the press in Hartford and in Norwich.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Huntington's plea, p. 29.

And then the minister who had tri∣umphed over them, turned his artillery against the baptist churches, and said, "When you re-baptize those in adult years, which we have baptized in their infancy, you, and they jointly renounce that Father Son and holy Ghost, whom we adore and worship, as the only living and true God, and on whom we depend for all our salvation."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">And address to his anabaptist brethren, by Joseph Hunt∣ington, D.

<P>YET a public complaint is now made, that "A general spirit reigns against the most liberal and ge∣nerous establishments in religion; against the civil magistrates encouraging or having any thing more to do about religion, than to keep the civil peace among contending sects." And the advocates for this liberty are implicitly accused of favouring infi∣delity. But to move rulers to exert their power for the support of ministers, they say, "The church has never been of any political detriment here, for it never has been vested with any civil or secular power in New-England.—And, God be thanked, the senatorial Assembly of this happiest of all the United States [Connecticut] still embosoms so many Phinehas's and Zerubbable's, so many religious pa∣triots, the friends of Jesus and his holy religion; and that the Messiah's cause is here accompanied with <HI>civil government</HI> and the <HI>priesthood;</HI> allusively the <HI>two olive-trees upon the right of the candlestick</HI> (the churches) <HI>and upon the left; the two golden branches, which through the two golden pipes,</HI> Mo∣ses

<P>THUS they hold their power from the <HI>lord bishops</HI> in England, who had theirs from Rome, or from the king. And rulers who have renounced foreign ju∣risdiction, cannot force the people to support such teachers, without violating the INDEPENDENCE of

And as those priests could turn a king out of the temple, teachers who have claim∣ed such power, have <HI>reigned over kings of the earth.</HI> 2 Chron. xxvi. 20. Rev. xvii. 18. Many of them were lately zealous for excluding the king's power from this land, who still hold their power over the parishes which they received in his name; and vio∣lence has often been used with persons who have conscientiously refused to acknowledge that power. Three men were imprisoned at Worcester for this cause, betwixt the compiling of our new Constitu∣tion, and the commencement of government upon it; and others since. And a new Law-book was pub∣lished in Connecticut in 1784, which does not allow any man to live therein, without paying taxes to such teachers, or else giving in a written acknowledge∣ment to the power that supports them. And for refusing to do it, two gentlement were robbed that fall of some lands in Woodstock, as a baptist tenant thereon had before been of a cow.</P>
<P>THESE gentlemen are of the posterity of the pas∣tor of the baptist church in Boston, when their meet∣ing-house was nailed up in 1680, at the instigation of
<PB N="29" REF="019485_0029_0FABAEFC93334C68"/>congregational ministers. Dr. Increase Mather was one of them; but he was so clearly convinced of his error afterwards, that he freely went into the same house, and assisted in ordaining a pastor of that church. And his son then delivered a sermon, wherein he exhorted good men to go as far in com∣muning together as they could without sin; but where any sinful terms were imposed, he says, "There the injunction of Heaven upon them is, <HI>Be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the un∣clean thing, and I will receive you.</HI> The <HI>imposers</HI> are the <HI>schismatics."</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Late history, vol. ii. p. 50.</NOTE> Which things touched the heart of Mr. Hollis, a baptist gentleman in Lon∣don, in such a manner as to make him the greatest benefactor to Harvard college, of any man upon earth. Yet of late, directly after three robbers were hanged in Cambridge, three baptists therein were robbed of their property for parish teachers; and when they sued for recompence, the case was turn∣ed against them in Cambridge, October 27, 1785, by the same judges who condemned the other rob∣bers; and that notwithstanding, our constitution says, "No subordination of any one sect or deno∣mination to another shall ever be established by law."</P>
<P>WHERE money is forced away from any people, and given to religious teachers, it bribes them to exert all their influence for the increase of such pow∣er; and this bribes rulers to continue in that prac∣tice. And the people are bribed with the opinion, that grace has brought them into a like covenant as Israel were in, who had a right to treat all others, both as to worship and commerce, as no others had a right to treat them. And a gift blinds the eyes of the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.

<P>IN 1708 the ministers in each county in Con∣necticut, were vested with a classical power over the churches, "upon all occasions ecclesiastical." And in 1744, the first church in Canterbury had no way to avoid hearing a candidate whom they had voted out, but by renouncing that power. Yet, for doing it, the ministers of Windham county so plainly ex∣alted themselves into the seat of God, as to take his warning against seducers, Deut. xiii. 1—3, and to turn it against their worship, saying to the people, "If there seem to be never so many appearances of God's power attending it, you may not go after it, any more than after a false God."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Late history, vol. ii. p. 37, 169.</NOTE> Since which above forty thousand people in New-England have withdrawn from that sect, and the most of them have turned to the baptist denomination; who are now accused, by a minister of said county, of renouncing the only living and true God: But how does he prove it?

MEN who bear the sword are to punish none but such as work ill to their neighbours, while in religion each one stands or falls to his own Master.

This was directed to the church of Rome, from whence divisions have spread through all the world; by putting baptism before faith, and by imposing other rules of faith, than ever came from our one Lord. Ministers, by what they have done upon the foreheads of infants, have cal∣led them Christians, without their own knowledge or choice; and rulers, as far as they could extend their power, have forced all to support such teach∣ers, or else to give in a written acknowledgment to the power that did it. Which two points exactly answer to the two parts of the body, on which the beast caused all to receive his mark; and the church obtains victory over him gradually. Rev. xiii. 16—18. xv. 2.

<P>THUS have men denied the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and have turned his grace into lasciviousness. Jude 3.4. For if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful; HE CANNOT DENY HIMSELF.

Hence a WILL in man opposite to NECESSITY from any cause with∣out himself, is ENMITY against God, and cannot be subject to his law, which is to love him with all our powers, and to love our neighbours as ourselves; upon which Christ says, <HI>This do, and thou shalt live.</HI> Luke x. 28. And to hold that these terms are <HI>se∣vere,</HI> is to hold that there is something <HI>unlovely</HI> in Him, whose revealed will is the only <HI>perfect law of liberty.</HI> James i. 13—25. To imagine that grace exempts us from the perfect authority of the moral
<PB N="37" REF="019485_0037_0FABAF09E163BEA8"/>law, shields the mind against conviction; for sin can only be known by the law. And to imagine that necessity is inconsistent with our liberty, exalts the mind above being bound by promises and oaths, and so above all government. Hereby men who make <HI>merchandise</HI> of the people, and promise them <HI>liberty,</HI> are themselves the <HI>servants of corruption.</HI> 2 Pet. ii. 3, 10, 19. For oaths are to lay a neces∣sity upon officers to be faithful, and upon witnesses to speak the truth; and when the opposite of this prevails, judgement is turned into <HI>wormwood,</HI> in∣stead of running down as free and refreshing <HI>waters.</HI> Amos v. 7, 24.

<P>No property can be held, nor government main∣tained, if the express condition thereof is violated with impunity. And the highest degree of moral obligation, is to believe and obey all the revealed will of God, who is the only fountain of all good∣ness and truth. And when Adam took and eat of the forbidden fruit, he became a robber and a rebel; and it is only of <HI>mercy</HI> that all his race are not <HI>con∣sumed.</HI> Lam. iii. 22, 39.

Ezek. xiv. 20. xxxiii. 11, 15. But the ways of men are so <HI>une∣qual,</HI> as often to recur to his sayings about personal agency, to prove that we were not made sinners in Adam, and that we cannot be made righteous by faith in what Christ has done for us, while they are as fierce as bears and lions against allowing others <HI>equal</HI> liberty with themselves. For if death be the <HI>wages</HI> of sin, and eternal life the free <HI>gift</HI> of God, which he may bestow on whom <HI>he will,</HI> while he pays others their just wages, it is infinitely danger∣ous for any to indulge their lusts, and to <HI>neglect the great salvation.</HI> Neither could men gratify pride and covetousness, under the name of godliness, if each one had equal liberty to obey God, who says, <HI>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of dark∣ness, but rather reprove them.</HI> Eph. v. 1—11. And he also says, <HI>I will give unto this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

<P>YET a late noted minister in Boston said, "There is no medium betwixt his being actually kind and merciful to all, and his being positively cruel and unmerciful to some."

Yet the cry of many teachers now is, <HI>Cast in thy lot among us, let us all have one purse.</HI> And much of the <HI>learning</HI> of the present day has been made use of, as the old savages did of their arrows, in shooting from their hiding-places at honest men who refuse to be confederates with them. Germany has been long ransacked for stories to prejudice the people against equal liberty and believer's baptism; but how was Britain involved in debt, and America in blood, by the late forces that were brought from thence! And an eminent historian in that country assures us, that for more than a century after the death of Christ, "The churches were entirely <HI>inde∣pendent;</HI> none of them subject to any foreign ju∣risdiction, but each one governed by its own rulers, and its own laws." After which teachers adopted a maxim from heathen philosophers, "That it was an act of virtue to <HI>deceive and lie,</HI> when by that means the <HI>interests</HI> of the church might be pro∣moted."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mosheim's eccl. hist. vol. i. p. 77, 155, 314.</NOTE> And no man has proved that infant baptism was ever named in the world, till after the
<PB N="46" REF="019485_0046_0FABAF142EA3D5A8"/>adoption of that maxim; since which the bringing of infants to a minister in the church, has been called their coming to Christ; whereas none <HI>can come</HI> to him but such as are <HI>taught of God,</HI> and such only are the <HI>children</HI> of his church. John vi. 44, 45. Isaiah liv. 1, 13.</P>
<P>BLIND guides among the Jews swore by gold and offerings, and not by the temple and alter whereby they were sanctified; upon which an eminent father of New-England said, "The estate of a saint is most happy and blessed, though the person never come near an office; but on the contrary, an officer, if he be not also, and first a saint, is a most wretched and accursed creature."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Robinson against Bernard, p. 217.</NOTE> <HI>Anathama</HI> is the portion of every man who loves not our Lord Jesus Christ, the only <HI>altar</HI> that can <HI>sanctify</HI> us and our gifts. 1 Cor. xvi. 22. Heb. xiii. 10—18. The <HI>national holiness</HI> of the Jews obliged them to put away their strange wives, and the children that were born of them. Deut. vii. 3—6. Ezra x. 19, 44. From whence seducers took occasion to forbid marriage, and to command men to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them who believe and know the truth: <HI>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 1—5. Family relations, with other temporal en∣joyments, are, in this way, <HI>sanctified and holy</HI> to believers; and will be much more so in the latter day, after God shall <HI>pour out his fury upon the fami∣lies that call not on his name.</HI> 1 Cor. vii. 14. Jer. x. 25. Zech. xiv. 20, 21. None can escape his vengeance but <HI>he that walketh righteously, and speak∣eth uprightly. he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that
<PB N="47" REF="019485_0047_0FABAF1465289A90"/>stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.</HI> These will be so far from supporting teachers with the power of saying, <HI>Thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force,</HI> that they will say, <HI>The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver, the Lord is our king, he will save us.</HI> Gallies and gallant ships shall then be a <HI>prey</HI> to the <HI>lame,</HI> whom they were designed to en∣slave or destroy. Isaiah xxxiii. 14—24. His word, which is the only perfect law of liberty, contains three maxims which never should be forgotten by any. First, that none should be chosen into office, but those who have been useful and faithful in pri∣vate stations. Secondly, that such, like the olive, fig-tree, and the vine, prefer the yielding of good fruit and happiness to others, to any promotion or power over them, Thirdly, that the man who makes use of any bribes or party influence to get into office, or to keep himself in power, is a <HI>bram∣ble,</HI> that would set all on fire rather than not have his will. Judges ix. 7—15. Acts xx. 28—35. Many of the primitive saints sealed these truths with their blood, and thereby overcame the great accuser. And as the way for the first coming of Christ was prepared by one who came in the <HI>spirit and power of Elias,</HI> so his future coming to reign on the earth will be introduced by the resurrection of the <HI>souls</HI> of those old martyrs; which may intend the revival of their <HI>spirit and power in the churches;</HI> for when they shall arise <HI>satan shall deceive the na∣tions no more,</HI> and when the two witnesses shall be raised, <HI>time shall be no longer.</HI> Rev. x. 6, 7. xi. 11, 15. xii. 11. xx. 3—6. And whether both prophesies do not point to the same glorious event, is humbly referred to the great Ruler of the universe.</P>
