<HEAD>A Vindication &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE very extraordinary demand which the go∣vernment of the State of <HI>New-York</HI> make on the grand Congress of the United States, to forthwith to de∣cide in their favor, (and as they would have it <HI>ex-part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that long and spirited controversy which has subs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> between them and the inhabitants of the territory no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> known by the name of <HI>Vermont,</HI> together with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣representations of facts, has induced the government o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Vermont,</HI> to publish to the impartial world, a further vindication of the conduct of those inhabitants than hath been already done, and exhibit to all wise and under∣standing Beings whom it may concern, the intrinsic causes, motives and reasons, of their assuming govern∣ment.</P>
<P>IT is well known that this contest was not occasioned by the late revolution, but existed many years before that the contending parties were greatly exasperated to∣wards each other; and that those inhabitants had ap∣pealed from the decision of the courts, as by law esta∣blished in the then province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to arms, and had anounced to the public their reason for so doing.</P>
<P>A SHORT state of the proceedings of both parties (be∣ing necessary to communicate to the public, in order to their rightly determining the merits of such an important dispute) is herewith given. And 1st. The government of <HI>New-York</HI> obtained the jurisdiction of the contested
<PB N="4" REF="016183_0004_0F9BCC145662C620"/>territory in 1764, ex-parte and contrary to the minds of the original Grantees and Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and therefore ought to be considered as null and void from the beginning. And secondly, The undue use and oppressive exercise which they have ever since made of the power of jurisdiction towards those inhabitants, al∣tho' their legal claim of jurisdiction was ever so well grounded, would fully justify those inhabitants in their opposition to that government, and in their assuming independence.</P>
<P>NO SOONER had the government of <HI>New-York</HI> obtain∣ed the jurisdiction of these lands, but they presumed to re-grant sundry large patents, interfering with prior grants from the government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> at a time when the Grantees under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> were in full possession of the very lands re-granted.</P>
<P>THIS reprehensible procedure of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid those inhabitants under the necessity of remonstrating against that government. They therefore impowered <HI>Samuel Robinson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> (then of <HI>Bennington</HI>) their Agent, to lay the same before the King and privy Council, together with a humble Petition from those in∣habitants, that the jurisdiction of those lands might be restored to <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> again. The consequences of these measures were favorable to the Grantees under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and were the means of obtaining the King's express prohibition to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to make no grants of lands in the disputed pre∣mises, on pain of his <HI>highest</HI> displeasure.</P>
<P>THE government of <HI>New-York</HI> did, nevertheless pre∣sume in direct violation of the said prohibition, to grant most of the prohibitted premises: and further proceeded to oppose the authority of the king, by erecting and
<PB N="5" REF="016183_0005_0F9BCC1510ABEDD8"/>establishing the counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> which are contained in the territory in dispute, though the king had signified to the said government, his utter disapprobation of the establishment thereof. And all this when the now Independent States were subject to the royal authority.</P>
<P>IN the year 1769, the claimants under the subsequent grants from <HI>New-York,</HI> and not residing on the contro∣verted premises, brought action of Ejectment in their supreme Court held at <HI>Albany,</HI> against sundry actual set∣tlers who claimed the soil by virtue of prior grants from <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> But most if not all the judges and at∣torn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es (particularly Messrs. <HI>Duane</HI> and <HI>Kemp</HI>) which attended the court, were patentees under <HI>New-York;</HI> and some of them intrusted in the very patents, then on trial.</P>
<P>The plantiffs appearing in great state and magnifi∣cence, which together with their junto of land thieves, made a brilliant appearance; but the defendants ap∣pearing in but ordinary fashion, having been greatly fatigued by hard labour wrought on the disputed pre∣mises, and their cash much exhausted, made a very dis∣proportionable figure at court. In fine, interest, con∣nection and grandeur, being all on one side, easily turn∣ed the scale against the honest defendants, and judgment without mercy in favor of the claimants under <HI>New-York</HI> was given against them. In the course of the tri∣al, a grant of the township from <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> under which the defendants claimed being produced in court, and also a certificate from the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> and his Secretary, that the said grant was legally executed to the grantees whose names were mentioned on the back of the charter, it was nevertheless ruled that the same should not be read in court.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016183_0006_0F9BCC15CF36D238"/>
SOON after, writs of possession were issued in form of law against the vanquished defendants, and new actions of ejectment were commenced against other of the in∣habitants; but their spirit was too great to bear such insults any longer; they therefore resisted and defeated the officers in their attempts to gain possession.</P>
<P>DIRECTLY after these tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the legislature of <HI>New-York</HI> passed a law annexing a penalty of thirty pounds fine and six Months imprisonment, on any of their subjects who should refute to assist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sheriff when legal∣ly requested, to carry into execution those writs of pos∣session.</P>
<P>THIS law had no sooner been promulgated, but Go∣vernor <HI>Tryon</HI> who then p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed over the government, gave orders to the militia of <HI>Albany</HI> county, to assist the sheriff in executing the writs aforesaid.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants being thus drove to the extremity of either quitting their posissions or resisting the sheriff and his posse. In this state of desparacy they put on forti∣tude and chose the latter expedient, and managed with that bravery that they defended their possessions; and the sheriff with his posse returned to their own land without any bloodshed on the occasion. But it should be confessed that this event was not altogether owing to the valour of the <HI>green mountain boys,</HI> for the militia were most generally persuaded that the cause of those inhabi∣tants was just; and that the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees were oppressive and unjust, and therefore they would not hazard their lives to assist them in such usurpation of the rights of their fellow men, and in the event were sure to be no gainers turn which way it would.</P>
<P>AFTER this ineffectual muster of the militia, the land schemers adopted different measures to accomplish their
<PB N="7" REF="016183_0007_0F9BCC1692049C20"/>designs, perceiving that the militia would not fight for their subsequent and exorbitant claims; and as to them∣selves, they were a jesuitical and cowardly junto of schemers, not inured to danger, hardships, or the hor∣rors of war, durst not fight for their own claim; their accustomed way to carry points being to deceive, cheat, and over reach the commonality of their species under pretext of law, justice, and good government. These are their horns of iron, and with them they do push. They were therefore obliged to follow their old and beaten road of politics; and by their influence caused a number of the leading men among those inhabitants, to be indicted as rioters, designing to have made such an example of them, as to fright the inhabitants in general to a tame compliance with the decisions of their courts of law, or which is the same thing, to yield up their property to them, and become their tenants and slaves.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants in general were apprised that this was their design, and guarded against it; were very ac∣tive and vig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent in defending their friends and neigh∣bours indicted as aforesaid; being fully persuaded that the said junto of patentees had in those very indictments for their object, the very lands which they the aforesaid inhabitants possessed.</P>
<P>SUNDRY proclamations under the signature of gover∣nor <HI>Tryon</HI> were issued, for the express purpose of appre∣hending those inhabitants which he was pleased to deno∣minate riotous, licentious, disorderly, &amp;c. and large re∣wards therein were offered for that purpose; but the governor and whole catalogue of patentees, had the mortification to be baffled in their attempts to take ri∣oters (as they phrased it) during the course of three years; and the green mountain boys prevailed against
<PB N="8" REF="016183_0008_0F9BCC17617BE258"/>them, seized their magistrates and emisaries; and in fine, all those their abettors which dared to venture upon the contested lands, and chastised them with the whips of the wilderness, the growth of the land which they co∣veted.</P>
<P>AND on the 9th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, the legislative authority of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> did pass twelve acts of outlawry, against those inhabitants, and they on their part published a declaration of a defensive war, a∣gainst the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the 26th day of <HI>April</HI> following; and extended their settlements and emigrants from <HI>New-England,</HI> increased their power, and they built fortifications in their frontier settlements, against the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and garrisoned them, and prospered until the late <HI>glorious revolution.</HI></P>
<P>A PARTICULAR history of this controversy from the commencement of it down to this aera, having been written by the writer of this vindication, and published in 1774. Intitled <HI>A brief Narrative of the proceedings of the government of</HI> New-York <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will be therefore needless, as also too prolix, to give the contents a place in this; and for this reason some memorable parts of it only are subjoined: and to the whole is added as an ap∣pendix, nine sections of the same; holding forth a clear confutation of a <HI>New-Yorkish</HI> doctrine, recently propa∣gated, of an antient right or theirs to the jurisdiction of the territory in dispute, with a chain of arguments cal∣culated on an extensive scale, and predicated on unde∣niable facts; evincing that the right of soil to the lands contained in the limits of the <HI>New-Hampshire Grants</HI> was conveyed to the grantees, by virtue of the respective grants; that their right to the lands therein contained is indefeasible; and that the royal adjudication of the
<PB N="9" REF="016183_0009_0F9BCC1A122A2968"/>boundary line between the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> should have operated as a line of jurisdiction only, and not in any measure to effect the property of the subject. Without the consideration of these arguments on the right of ti∣tle of those lands, a just conclusion on the contro∣versy cannot be drawn; for if those settlements were an intrusion on the right of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> it would in a great measure extenuate their conduct towards them; but if on the grounds of justice and solid argument the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants are good and valid, it must of necessity invalidate the <HI>New-York</HI> interfering grants, and leave that go∣vernment no excuse for their abuse to those inhabi∣tants. This we refer to the public and proceed to the later stages of the controversy.</P>
<P>THE approaching rupture between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>Colonies</HI> was matter of serious reflection to the inhabitants of this frontier; their controversy with <HI>New-York,</HI> having (at a great expence) been previously submitted to the king and privy council, by the negociation of special agents at two different times, and was in a high probability of being de∣termined in their favor; which influenced some of the inhabitants to take a part with <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> the more so, as this part of the country was a fron∣tier, and of consequence would be greatly under the enemy's power, who was then in possession of <HI>Ticon∣deroga, Crown-Point</HI> and St. <HI>Johns,</HI> and commanded the lake with a vessel of force besides. At the same time their settlements were extended on the east side of the lake almost to the province of <HI>Quebec.</HI> This
<PB N="10" REF="016183_0010_0F9BCC1A4FEB12C0"/>was their situation when on the very eve of a war with <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE battle of <HI>Lexington</HI> almost distracted them, for interest inclined them to favor the royal side of the dispute, but the stronger impulses of affection to their country, excited them to resent its wrongs, and obtain satisfaction for the blood of their massa∣cre'd countrymen. Their condition was truly per∣plexed and critical: their hopes were placed on the royal authority for their deliverance from the in∣croachments and oppressions of the government of <HI>New-York;</HI> but the ties of consanguinity, personal acquaintance and friendship, similarity of religion and manners to the <HI>New-England</HI> governments from whom these inhabitants had most generally emigra∣ted, weighed very heavy in their deliberations; be∣sides, the cause of the country was generally believed to be just; and that resistance to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had become the indispensible duty of a free people. But there was one very knotty query, which exercised the minds of their best politicians, viz. Provided they should take an active part with their country. And furthermore. Provided an accommodation should take place, and the colonies return to their former allegiance, what would then become of them or their remonstrances against the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> lodged at the court of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> but this danger seems to have been luckily passed over.</P>
<P>SOON after the news of the <HI>Lexington</HI> battle, the principal officers of the green montain boys, and o∣ther principal inhabitants were convened at <HI>Benning∣ton,</HI> and attempted to explore futurity, but it was found to be unfathomable; and the scences which
<PB N="11" REF="016183_0011_0F9BCC1B1210E890"/>have since taken place, then appeared to be precari∣ous and uncertain. However, it was imagined that provided those inhabitants were loyal to their coun∣try, and the event of the war should prove favora∣ble to <HI>America,</HI> and their struggles for liberty should bring about a revolution in stead of a rebellion; that in this case they should rid themselves of the grievous usurpation of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and be entitled and readily admitted to any privileges which could reasonably be expected on revolution principles, which undoubtedly will be the consequence; (for it can hardly be doubted, that provided the said inhabitants had exercised the same degree of loyalty to the king that they have to the country, they might have shared as great privileges from the royal favor, as they now request of Con∣gress, viz. Provided the event of the war had prov∣ed as successful to <HI>Britain</HI> as it has to <HI>America.</HI>) And as every of the colonies and plantations were then taking arms for the mutual security of their li∣berty; and it was equally just and incumbant on the inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, to do the same. It was therefore reserved to take an ac∣tive part with the country, and thereby annihilate the old quarrel with the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> by swallowing it up in the general conflict for liber∣ty; at that time not apprehending the least danger (on the proviso of a revolution's taking place) that congress would resolve them to belong to the go∣vernment of <HI>New-York;</HI> or in any manner counte∣nance their being deprived of their liberty by sub∣jecting them under the power of a government which they detest more than that of the British,
<PB N="12" REF="016183_0012_0F9BCC1BD13DC9B0"/>which they have manfully assisted the United States to suppress.</P>
<P>BUT the enemy having the command of lake <HI>Champlain</HI> and the garrisons contiguous to it, was ground of great uneasiness to those inhabitants who had extended their settlements on the rivers <HI>Otter∣creek,</HI> and <HI>Onion</HI>-river, and along the east side of the lake aforesaid, who, in consequence of a war, would be under the power of the enemy. It was therefore projected to surprise the garrisons of <HI>Ticonderoga</HI> and <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> with the armed vessel in the lake, and gain the command of that important pass; in as much as such an event would in a great measure se∣cure those inhabitants from the enemy, obliging them to take post in <HI>Canada:</HI> but whether such a measure would be agreeable to congress or not they could not for certain determine. But it was appre∣hended that if those posts were not soon taken they would be strongly reinforced, and become impreg∣nable to any attack short of a regular siege, for which, at that time, the country were very deficient in the articles of artillery, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHILE these matters were deliberating, a com∣mittee from the council of <HI>Connecticut</HI> arrived at <HI>Bennington,</HI> with advice and directions to carry into execution the surprise of those garrisons; and, if possible, to gain the command of the lake. Which was done without loss of time.</P>
<P>DURING near two years in the first of the war with <HI>Britain,</HI> the inhabitants of these contested lands go∣verned themselves, and managed their internal po∣lice under the direction of committees and conventi∣ons, as they had done from the commencement of their
<PB N="13" REF="016183_0013_0F9BCC1C93A18728"/>controversy with the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> a small number of the inhabitants excepted, who are situate in the southeast corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> county, who adhere to the government last mentioned, and are part of them tories.</P>
<P>ON the 15th day of <HI>January</HI> 1777, the inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants to the westward of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI>-river, at a general convention, abrogated their former modes of government, <HI>viz.</HI> by com∣mittees and conventions, and declared themselves A FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATE, and have formed their constitution and mode of government, elected their officers both civil and military; and made and established a code of laws for the future government of the State.</P>
<P>AND in consequence of their frontier situation have been invaded by <HI>Britons, Hessians, Savages,</HI> and more savage <HI>tories;</HI> and have (as they humbly conceive) in their various struggles for liberty, fairly merited the inestimable enjoyment of it. This they consider as the ultimate reward of their many expensive toils, battles, and hazards; and for the attainment of which, they have endured such an uncommon series of concomitant evils.</P>
<P>On the 23d day of <HI>February</HI> 1778, his excellency governor CLINTON, in pursuance of the request of the Senate and Assembly of the State of <HI>New-York,</HI> issued his proclamation, which is here transcribed, with the answer to the same, which was published in <HI>August</HI> following.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="proclamation">
<HEAD>By his Excellency GEORGE CLINTON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Gover∣nor of the State of <HI>New-York,</HI> General of all the Militia, and Admiral of the Navy of the same.
<PB N="14" REF="016183_0014_0F9BCC1D4F5E5768"/>
A PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the Senate and Assembly of this state, <NOTE PLACE="marg">L. S.</NOTE> did, by their several resolutions passed the twenty-first day of this instant month of <HI>February,</HI> declare and resolve, That the disaffection of many persons, inhabiting the north eastern parts of the county of <HI>Albany,</HI> and certain parts of the counties of <HI>Charlotte, Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Gloucester,</HI> clearly included within the ancient, original, true and lately established bounds of this state, arose from a contest, about the property of the soil of many tracts of land, within those parts of the said counties re∣spectively.</P>
<P>THAT the said contest was occasioned partly by the issuing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the respective governments of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the one part, and those of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> on the other, antecedent to the late esta∣blishment of the eastern boundary of this state; part∣ly by an higher quit-rent reserved on the said lands, when re-granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> than were reserv∣ed in the original grants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and the exorbitant fees of office accruing thereon; and partly by a number of grants made by the late government of <HI>New-York</HI> after the establishment of the said eastern boundary, for lands which had been before granted by the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> respective∣ly, or one of them; in which last mentioned grants by the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the interest of the servants of the crown, and of new adventurers, was, in many instances, contrary to justice and po∣licy,
<PB N="15" REF="016183_0015_0F9BCC1E127A7418"/>preferred to the equitable claims for confirma∣tion of those who had patented the lands under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the aforesaid disaffection has been greatly increased, by an act passed by the legislature of the late colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the ninth day of <HI>March,</HI> in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hun∣dred and seventy four, entitled, "An Act for pre∣venting tumultuous and riotous assemblies in the places therein mentioned, and for the more speedy and effectual punishing the rioters." That many of the aforesaid disaffected persons, though unjusti∣fiable in their opposition to the authority of this state labour under grievances arising from the caus∣es above mentioned, which in some measure extenu∣ate their offence, and which ought to be redressed.</P>
<P>THAT therefore the legislature of this state, while on the one hand, they will vigorously maintain their rightful supremacy over the persons and property of those disaffected subjects, will on the other hand, make overtures to induce the voluntary submission of the delinquents.</P>
<P>THAT an absolute and unconditional discharge, and remission of all prosecutions, penalties and for∣feitures, under the above-mentioned act, shall be an established preliminary to such overtures; which overtures are as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. THAT all persons actually possessing and im∣proving lands, by title under grants from <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and not granted un∣der <HI>New-York,</HI> shall be confirmed in their respective possessions.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="016183_0016_0F9BCC1ED209E798"/>
2d. THAT all persons actually possessing and im∣proving lands, not granted by either of the three governments, shall be confirmed in their respective possessions, together with such additional quantity of vacant land, lying contiguous to each respective possession, as may be necessary to form the same in∣to a convenient farm; so as the quantity to be con∣firmed to each respective person, including his pos∣session, shall not exceed three hundred acres.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THAT where lands have heretofore been granted by <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> or either of them, and actually possessed in conse∣quence thereof, and being so possessed, were after∣wards granted by <HI>New-York,</HI> such possessions shall be confirmed, the posterior grant under <HI>New-York,</HI> notwithstanding.</P>
<P><HI>Provided always,</HI> That nothing in the above re∣gulations contained, shall be construed to determine any question of title or possession, that may arise between different persons claiming under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> or between persons claiming under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> on the one, and un∣der <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> on the other part, independent of any right or claim under <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T. THAT with respect to all such cases, con∣cerning the aforesaid controverted lands, as can not be decided by the rules exhibited in the aforegoing articles, or some or one of them, the legislature of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> will provide for the determi∣nation of the same, according to the rules of justice and equity arising out of such cases respectively, without adhering to the strict rules of law.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="17" REF="016183_0017_0F9BCC1F920D0C48"/>
5th. THAT in all cases where grants or confirma∣tions shall become necessary, on acceptance of the above overtures, such grants or confirmations, shall issue to the grantees, at and after the rate of five pounds for a grant or confirmation of three hun∣dred acres or under, and for every additional hun∣dred acres, the additional sum of sixteen shillings, except in cases, where lands shall be granted or con∣firmed to divers persons in one entire tract, in which case the grants shall issue, respectively, for fifteen pounds each, which allowances shall be in lieu of all other fees or perquisites whatsoever.</P>
<P N="6">6th.

<P>THIS proclamation, after mentioning a disaf∣fection of many persons inhabiting the northeast parts of the county of <HI>Albany,</HI> and certain parts of the counties of <HI>Charlotte, Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Gloucester,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="016183_0020_0F9BCC23D35A0678"/>proceeds to affirm that these tracts of country were clearly included within the ancient, original, true and lately established bounds of the state of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>THAT many, nay, almost the whole of the inha∣bitants in those counties, <HI>alias,</HI> the state of <HI>Vermont,</HI> are disaffected to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> will not be disputed. This is a fact: But it is not a fact, that the ancient, original and true bounds of <HI>New-York</HI> included those lands. The first intimation that ever saluted the ears of the public, asserting this doctrine, was, from a proclamation of governor <HI>Tryon</HI>'s, dated the 11th day of <HI>December,</HI> 1771, which begins thus: <Q>Whereas, it is the ancient and incon∣testible right of this colony, to extend to <HI>Connec∣ticut</HI>-river as its eastern boundary.</Q> This asser∣tion hath been answered at large in my Treatise on the Conduct of this Government towards the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers, to which I refer the reader, and at present observe, that as the quoted assertions in these proclamations, are wholly without foundation, they need only to be as positively denied as they are asserted. The fact is, that the tract of land which now comprehends the state of <HI>Vermont,</HI> was universally known to be in the government of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> Thus it was placed by all Geographers in their maps, 'till the year 1764, when the now <HI>English</HI> King, for certain polical reasons, which I shall mention, extended the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York</HI> over the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nises, by his special royal authority. At the time of the alteration of this jurisdiction, jea∣lousies had fir'd the minds of king and parliament against the growth and rising power of <HI>America,</HI> and
<PB N="21" REF="016183_0021_0F9BCC2410A26858"/>at this time they began to advance men and govern∣ments into power, with a political design to crush the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>America. New York</HI> had ever been their favorite government: They could almost vie with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the art of vassalaging common people, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sing every idea of liberty from the human mind, by making and keeping them poor and servile. This <HI>Great Britain</HI> well knew, and therefore sheed a large territory from <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> and asided it to <HI>New-York,</HI> to depress the pow∣er of the one, and enlarge and extend the other. A well concerted plan: But the <HI>green mountain boys</HI> disconcerted it, by throwing their weight in to the scale of congress, which, thank GOD, has fairly ponderated. Thus may be seen the design, as well as date, of the original, ancient and true bounds of the state of <HI>New-York</HI>'s being extended over the state of <HI>Vermont;</HI> and for the same reason it was thus extended by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it will undoubtedly be curtailed by congress.</P>
<P>As to the acts of outlawry, mentioned in the proclamation, they died a natural death the first day of <HI>January</HI> 1776, as may be seen from the act itself, here quoted: <Q>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that this act shall remain and continue in full force and effect, from the passing thereof, until the first day of <HI>January,</HI> which will be in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six.</Q></P>
<P>THE subjects of the state of <HI>Vermont,</HI> were under no apprehensions from these old lifeless acts: Nor do I conceive, that the present legislature of the state of <HI>New-York</HI> have laid them under any obliga∣tion,
<PB N="22" REF="016183_0022_0F9BCC24D4547BA8"/>in granting their a pardon. It was a matter which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> leg <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>New-York.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; and the party last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> old quarrel with M. <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that the legislature of the state of <HI>New-York</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> late in the day, undertook to give an <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dis∣charge and remission of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and forfei∣tures incurred,</Q> under an act which had been long dead; and which, when alive, served only to discover to the world, the wickedness and depravity of that legislative body which enacted them. In the lifetime of this act, I was called by the <HI>Yorkers</HI> an outlaw, and afterwards by the <HI>British</HI> was called a rebel; and I humbly conceive, that there was as much propriety in the one name as the other, and I verily believe, that the king's commissione<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s would now be as willing to pardon me for the sin of rebel∣lion, provided I would afterwards be subject to <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> as the legislature abovementioned, provided I would be subject to <HI>New-York;</HI> and, I must con∣fess, I had as leave be a subject to the one as the other, and, it is well known, I have had great ex∣perience with them both.</P>
<P>NEXT, I propose to consider that part of the pro∣clamation called Overtures, which are contained in the three first articles. Article 1st. <Q>That all per∣sons actually possessing and improving lands, by title under grants from <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Massa∣chusetts-Bay,</HI> and not granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> shall be confirmed in their respective possessions.</Q></P>
<P>THIS first article cannot be considered of any material consequence, inasmuch, as among almost
<PB N="23" REF="016183_0023_0F9BCC25C0D07730"/>the whole possessions referred to in the article, there are but very few if any, but what are covered with <HI>New-York</HI> grants.</P>
<P>THE second article is as follows: <Q>That all per∣sons possessing and improving lands, not granted by either of the three governments, shall be con∣firmed in their respective possessions, together with such additional quantity of vacant land, ly∣ing contiguous to each respective possessions, as may be necessary to form the same into a conveni∣ent farm, so as the quantity of land to be confirm∣ed to each respective possession, shall not exceed three hundred acres.</Q></P>
<P>NEITHER of these two first articles, called Over∣tures, affect the controversy, except in some very few instances, inasmuch as all, or in a manner all the possessions spoken of, were first granted by <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> except some few which were granted by <HI>Massachusetts Bay;</HI> and then, lastly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>post the whole of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possessions regranted by <HI>New-York.</HI> This being the case, what has been hitherto proposed, does not reach the essence of the controversy, as the <HI>New York <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> very well know; besides, it is not in the power of the government to confirm any of those possessions which have been already granted, and therefore become the property of the grantees, as will be more fully discussed in its proper place. I proceed to the third article of the much boasted Overtures.</P>
<P><Q>THAT where lands have been heretofore grant∣ed by <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> or either of them, and actually possessed in conse∣quence thereof, and being so possessed, were af∣terwards
<PB N="24" REF="016183_0024_0F9BCC2652C44A70"/>granted by <HI>New-York,</HI> such possession shall be confirmed, the posterior grant under <HI>New-York</HI> notwithstanding.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH it is absolutely out of the power of the said legislative authority, to confirm the possessions mentioned; yet, to discover their want of generosi∣ty in their proposal, I shall, in the first place, con∣sider what a trifling proportion of those possessions could be confirmed upon their own stating, inas∣much, as the confirming clause in the article, only confirms the possessor, who being so possessed at the time that the <HI>New-York</HI> grant was said, and has no respect to any additional possession carried on af∣ter the grant took place: The identical words are, <Q>And being so possessed, were afterwards granted by <HI>New-York;</HI></Q> <HI>viz.</HI> After such possession was actually made, and the possessor being so in posses∣sion at the time the grant took place, such possessi∣on shall be confirmed, but any later possession can∣not be included in the condition of <Q>being so pos∣sessed;</Q> for, a later possession was no possession at all at the time the condition of possession took place; and consequently, every possession which has been begun in the state of <HI>Vermont,</HI> since the lands were granted by <HI>New-York,</HI> must be lost to the pos∣sessor, and fall into the hands of the <HI>New-York</HI> gran∣tees, with all other uncultivated lands in the state; and all our purchases of those lands from <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> fall to the ground, together with our possessions, which have been in∣creased an hundred fold.</P>
<P>THESE Overtures have hitherto been considered only in a grammatical and logical sense, allowing
<PB N="25" REF="016183_0025_0F9BCC27189CE740"/>them their own construction; I now proceed to con∣sider them in a law sense. A legislative authority, within its own jurisdiction, may confirm a possession on vacant land, by making a grant of the same to the possessor: But, for the legislative authority of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> to pretend as they do in their proclamation, to vacate any grants, made by their own authority, in favor of any possession, and to confirm such possessions, by nullifying and defearing their own grants, is the height of folly and stupidi∣ty: For, the lands being once granted, the proper∣ty passeth to the grantee, who is become the sole proprietor of the same; and he is as independent of that legislative authority which granted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as any person may be supposed to be, who purchaseth a farm of land of me by deed of conveyance; and it is as much out of the power of that legislature to vacate a grant made by them, or the same authori∣ty, in favor of any possessor, as it is out of my power to vacate my deed of conveyance in favor of some second person. It is contrary to common sense to suppose, that the property of the subject is at the arbitrary disposal of the legislature: If it was, they might give a grant to day, and vacate it to morrow, and so on, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> This would de∣stroy the very nature and existance of personal pro∣perty, as the whole would depend on the sovereign will and last act of the legislature: But the train of the matter is, the first conveyance will, and ought to hold good; and this defeats all subsequent con∣veyances.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said on this subject, it ap∣pears, that the overtures in the proclamation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="016183_0026_0F9BCC27D1441AE0"/>forth, are either romantic, or calculated to deceive woods people, who, in general, may not be suppos∣ed to understand law, or the power of a legislative authority.</P>
<P>I HAVE further to evince my arguments on this subject, by the concurring opinion of the Lords of the Board of Trade, on complaint made to them from those very persons, possessing the land we are speaking of. That clause of their report which is similar to what I have argued, is in these words: <Q>Such subsequent grants made by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> however unwarrantable, cannot be set aside by any authority from his majesty, in case the grantees shall insist on their title.</Q></P>
<P>THUS it appears, in a trial (of the same case we are treating of) before the board of trade, that the king, under whose authority the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had, in an oppressive manner granted those very lands, could not, by his royal authority, vacate or set aside the grants; yet the present legis∣lative authority of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> proclaim to the world, and pledge the faith of government, that they will do it. But enough has been said on the impossibility of it, as well as on the ungenerous∣ness of the proposal: And as to the quit-rents, the General Assembly of the state of <HI>Vermont</HI> will de∣termine their expediency, and probably release them all.</P>
<P>WHAT has been observed, answers every part of the proclamation worth notice, as the five last arti∣cles had an entire reference to the three first; though it may be worth observing, that the time of compli∣ance with those overtures are run out, and it is my
<PB N="27" REF="016183_0027_0F9BCC289460F310"/>opinion, that but few of the subjects of the state of <HI>Vermont</HI> have closed with them. The main induce∣ment I had in answering them was, to draw a full and convincing proof from the same, that the short∣est, best, and most eligible, I had almost said, the only possible way of vacating those <HI>New-York</HI> inter∣fering grants, is, to maintain inviolable the supre∣macy of the legislative authority of the independent state of <HI>Vermont.</HI> This, at one stroke, overturns every <HI>New-York</HI> scheme which may be calculated for our ruin, makes us free men, confirms our pro∣perty, "and puts it fairly in our power to help our∣selves" to the enjoyment of the great blessings of a free, uncorrupted and virtuous civil government.</P>

IT is apprehended that what has been already an∣imadverted on the first of these proclamations, a∣mounts to a clear refutation of the essential parts of both; especially to those who are acquainted with the circumstances of the granting and settling those lands, but to the public in general, who are not. The answer is not sufficiently explanatory: we have therefore thought it expedient, to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me addi∣tional observations on the first of them, with a full answer to the latter. Inasmuch as the leading gen∣tlemen of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> in both public and private company, when discussing on the controversy, do not hesitate, in the most positive manner, to affirm, and stake their honor, that their government have really offered (those deluded peo∣ple) the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> a full and authentic confirmation of their lands granted by <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay;</HI> but that they are, ne∣vertheless, "refractory and licentiously disposed." The truth of this matter must be learnt from such part of the aforesaid proclamations called overtures, which is all that ever have been pretended to be made from that government to those inhabitants.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Clinton</HI>'s first proclamation begins with an air of penitence, pointing out a number of grievances, which he admits those inhabitants "have laboured under, which, in some measure, extenuate their offence, and which ought to be redressed." This then is the point at issue, whether those over∣tures are calculated for that purpose, or are adiquate to it, or not: or whether they were not rather cal∣culated to deceive and insnare the people to whom they were made.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="016183_0032_0F9BCC2C4FD2CBE8"/>
"THAT the said contest was occasioned, partly by the issuing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the respective government of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the one part, and those of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> on the other, antecedent to the late establish∣ment of the eastern boundary of this state."</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to this establishment, which was in 1764, the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had granted but two small parcels of land in the new territory of <HI>Vermont,</HI> namely, the patent of <HI>Hoosick,</HI> in 1765, which is supposed to extend into the township of <HI>Pownal,</HI> and to include five or six thousand acres of land in said town, which is situate in the southwest corner of the state of <HI>Vermont:</HI> and also the patent of <HI>Wallumscock,</HI> in 1739, is said to interfere with the townships of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and <HI>Bennington;</HI> includ∣ing about five thousand acres of land: these are all the <HI>New-York</HI> patents which interfered with the li∣mits of <HI>Vermont,</HI> at the time of the settlement of their eastern boundary,; "and partly by a num∣ber of grants made under the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> after the establishment of the said eastern boundary, which had been granted by the govern∣ments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> re∣spectively, or one of them; in which the last men∣tioned grants by the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the interest of the servants of the crown, and of new adventures, was, in many instances, contrary to jus∣tice and policy, preferred to the equitable claims for confirmation of those who had patented the lands under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI>"</P>

<P>THE government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> previous to the settlement of the said boundary line, (and when those lands were universally supposed to be in that government) had granted one hundred and thirty-six townships, six miles square, in the territory of the now state of <HI>Vermont.</HI> Previous to these grants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> the government of the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts-Bay</HI> had granted sundry tracts of land in the territory aforesaid, which in the settlement of the boundary line between them and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in 1739, fell within the jurisdiction of the latter, and was by them mostly confirmed to the original grantees under <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI> No sooner had the government of <HI>New-York</HI> obtained jurisdiction of the said territory, but they proceeded to re-grant the lands aforesaid to new adventurers, in prejudice to the grantees and actual settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay:</HI> But remonstrances from them against the oppressions of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> as mentioned aforesaid, procured the king's prohibition, which is as follows.</P>

<P>The government of <HI>New-York,</HI> in the face of this prohibition, presumed still to regrant the said lands included in the aforesaid one hundred and thirty-six townships till nearly the whole was circumscribed in the limits of their subsequent patents, except an inconsiderable number of townships near <HI>Connecti∣cut</HI>-river; which, on condition of surrendering to them the original charters under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> were at the exorbitant fees of two thousand and three hundred Spanish milled dollars for each town∣ship granted to the original grantees under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="016183_0035_0F9BCC2F5B332668"/>again, with a reservation of a much higher quit-rent than what was reserved in the original grants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and at a very great expence obtained: And it is worthy of a remark, that the said interfering patents from <HI>New-York</HI> were mostly made after the said prohibition was certified to them. "That an absolute and unconditional dis∣charge and remission of all prosecutions, penalties, and forfeitures, under the above-mentioned act, shall be and established preliminary to such over∣tures."</P>
<P>As the laws alluded to in the said act were tem∣porary, and the term for their continuing in force expired more than two years; consequently they were as tho' they had not been, in every sense, ex∣cept that they intailed an eternal disgrace on the government of <HI>New-York</HI> for enacting them, which infamy hath been renued by the aforesaid proposal of a mock pardon; ushered in as an established pre∣liminary to certain overtures, which the present go∣vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> were making to the citizens of <HI>Vermont.</HI> It seems they expected that this would be considered as an eminent display of their good∣ness, and pave the way for their overtures which were equally empty and impertinent. The preli∣minary containing no pardon, and the overtures confirmed no lands; as the arguments previously published, and in this defence again exhibitted, will clearly evince, to which the reader is refer'd.</P>
<P>"THAT with respect to all such cases concerning the aforesaid controverted lands, as cannot be decid∣ed by the rules exhibitted in the aforegoing articles, or some or one of them; the legislature or the state
<PB N="36" REF="016183_0036_0F9BCC3013870DD0"/>of <HI>New-York</HI> will provide for the determination of the same, according to the rules of justice and equi∣ty arising out of such cases respectively, without adhering to the strict rules of law."</P>
<P>FROM fifteen years acquaintance with the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York, Vermont</HI> is by no mean, wil∣ling to trust this important controversy to their decision of justice and equity, as it has hitherto de∣viated from every idea of those rules of moral recti∣tude which are practised by virtuous governments; their notions of justice and equity seem to be un∣natural and unjust; at least, every sample of it which they have as yet exhibitted to those inhabi∣tants appears to be so; probably a habit of inslav∣ing their subjects has beat it into their heads, that it is just; and thus people commonly conceive it to be just to inslave <HI>negroes.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS strange that the said legislature had not con∣sidered this difficulty which the said inhabitants la∣bor under before they made the offer; for though the legislature may, for all that can be objected to their former conduct, be really honestly disposed; yet such a belief could hardly rationally be suppos∣ed to gain credit among a people who have suffered such flagrant and high handed oppressions from both the legislative and executive authority; and where it is the interest and very genius of the government, to inrich individuals on the tenantage, poverty and slavery of the great mass of their subjects, a little seriour reflection might have determined them not to make such a proposal; and consequently, not have put us to the blush in answering the same. It is hoped that this freedom of writing will be excu∣sed,
<PB N="37" REF="016183_0037_0F9BCC30D19CF110"/>as we are obliged in this defence, to give our reasons for rejecting these overtures.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the proposal of the aforesaid le∣gislature, every inhabitant in the contested territory would be liable to a trial at law for his land, in some way which the legislature shall provide, for the de∣termination of his tide. Those inhabitants have scent too much money already in land trials at the <HI>New York</HI> courts, but could never have the charters under which they held their land, so much as read in court.</P>
<P>But it may be argued, that agreeable to the arti∣cles of Confederation of the United States, that per∣sons holding under grants from different govern∣ments, may have a right of petitioning for a decision, agreeable to the method therein prescribed. But this would give birth to new troubles. The farm∣ers of <HI>Vermont</HI> are unskilled in law, and by no means a match for the over-grown wealthy <HI>New York</HI> pa∣tentees; but insufficient as they may be supposed for the task, they have, upon this plan, to go thro' a course of law in the state of <HI>New-York;</HI> and then, for certain, have to petition agreeable to the mode of trial pointed out by the articles of confederation; and it will be readily conceived, that not many of them are able to defray such an expence, or capa∣ble of managing such an important lawsuit.—Besides, the articles of confederation are not yet subscribed to by the several United States; and it is uncertain whether they ever will; especially as they now stand. And consequently the grantees holding under dif∣ferent grants have, as yet, no right to a decision by petitioning in the manner before-mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="016183_0038_0F9BCC3252328608"/>
WE come now to the consideration of governor <HI>Clinton</HI>'s last proclamation of the 31st of <HI>October</HI> 1778.</P>
<P>"WHEREAS the Senate and Assembly of this state, did by their concurrent resolutions, passed the 21st day of <HI>February</HI> last, propose certain overtures with respect to the controverted lands in the north∣eastern parts of the county of <HI>Albany</HI> and certain parts of the counties or <HI>Cumberland, Charlottes</HI> and <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in order to quiet the disorders prevailing in that part of the state.</P>
<P>"AND WHEREAS the said resolutions have been misrepresented by some, and misunderstood by o∣thers and are deemed not to apply to the cases of many persons entitled to relief, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"AND WHEREAS the Senate and Assembly, in order more effectually to remove such apprehensions and more fully to explain the said resolutions, and manifest the equitable intentions of the legislature, have by their concurrent resolutions passed this present session."</P>
<P>THE public would naturally by this spacious in∣troduction to the resolve hereafter to be mentioned, imagine that the aforesaid equitable intention of the legislature, would shine in robes of justice and ge∣nerosity; and explain the first proclamation alluded to, in some spiritual sense, very different from its literal meaning: but in stead of that, we find the subsequent patents under the government <HI>New-York</HI> virtually confirmed, and the grantees and actual settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> exposed to the same or similer intriegues which they ever have been by that government since they laid their interfering patents on those lands, as will ap∣pear
<PB N="39" REF="016183_0039_0F9BCC3317F0AD68"/>from the resolve itself. "<HI>Resolved,</HI> That with respect to all such lands which have heretofore been granted by the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and have not been since granted by the government of <HI>New-York;</HI> that all such grants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> shall be confirmed and declared good, valid and ef∣fectual, to all intents and purposes, as if the same had been made by the government of <HI>New-York.</HI>"</P>
<P>THIS resolve which the said legislature are pleas∣ed to call an overture to the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> is a palpable insult and affront to the common rea∣son of mankind; inasmuch as not only the same le∣gislature as well as every of those inhabitants of common sense, very well know that all the lands of any considerable consequence which have been granted by the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> have been long since actually granted by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> as has been before particularly represented; so that this last product on from the senate and assembly of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> as exhibitted in the said procla∣mation, is big with mischief and manifest design a∣gainst the claimants and actual settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>THE senate and assembly of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> have in the same proclamation, proposed a very extraordinary arbitration between them the said legislature, and the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> and submit it to congress to appoint the arbitrators.</P>
<P>THEIR proposal is as follows. "<HI>Resolved there∣fore,</HI> That in all cases of disputes arising between persons claiming under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massa∣chusetts-Bay</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="016183_0040_0F9BCC33D7FFE3F0"/>on the one, and <HI>New-York</HI> on the other part, for the same lands; besides confirming possessi∣ons as were made under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massa∣chusetts-Bay,</HI> prior to any grants for the same under <HI>New-York,</HI> the legislature will submit the determi∣nation thereof to such persons as the congress of the united states shall elect for that purpose."</P>
<P>THIS proposal is really whimsical, or calculated to rid themselves of the fulfilment of confirming certain possessions in the disputed territory, for the faithful performance whereof they pledged the faith of government, as may be seen in governor <HI>Clinton</HI>'s first proclamation, and the absurdity and utter im∣practicability of such a confirmation being pointed out in the answer to the same of the 9th of <HI>August</HI> last. It seems that the said legislature have indea∣vored to rid themselves of this difficulty by laying it on congress: but it should be considered, that neither the said legislature or congress, are parties concerned in the case; the dispute, as it respects the interfering grants, lies between the grantees of the three governments respectively: they, and only they, have a right of trial at common law, or to refer it to arbitration, provided they agree; but it is no part of the business of the said legislature or of congress, or both together, to bring forward such an arbitra∣tion as the said resolve proposeth: as on suppositi∣on, (for congress are too wise to do it) should con∣gress adopt the said proposal, and elect certain men to determine a dispute between the legislature of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> and suppose furthermore, that such decision should be in favor of the inhabitants; yet this would be
<PB N="41" REF="016183_0041_0F9BCC349434D618"/>no bar against a process at law against those inhabi∣tants, by the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees, who would, after a hundred such chimerical arbitrations, have the same right of trial at common law, as they now have; for the legislature of the state of <HI>New-York</HI> cannot be supposed to be a party in these cares or to have any right to an arbitration, any more than the legis∣lature of the state of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> or any indiffer∣ent person whatsoever; nor is it possible for the le∣gislature of the state of <HI>New-York</HI> or Congress, to settle those disputes any other ways but upon the principles of common law; so that the pro∣posal of the said legislature appears to be weak and impertinent.</P>
<P>THESE overtures bear a near resemblence to those of the <HI>British</HI> parliament to the united states; in which cases it is not to be supposed, that there was any sincerity. No favor is either asked or expected by the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont</HI> from the legislature of the state of <HI>New-York;</HI> they do not blame them for not confirming their grants under <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay;</HI> for they know that in∣asmuch as the same lands have been since granted by the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> it is out of their power to confirm their possessions; but they blame them for pretening to do it when they know they cannot do it: and also that they do not design to do it, as appears from the curious reserve of confirming "all such lands which have heretofore been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> or <HI>Massachu∣setts-Bay,</HI>" nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly follows the bite, "and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> been hnce granted by the government or <HI>New-York.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="016183_0042_0F9BCC354F68B3C0"/>
FROM the foregoing animadversions on these pro∣clamations it manifestly appears; that the new go∣vernment of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> are pursuing the measures adopted by the old; which is the plan that they are determined to affect, or nothing at all. From first to last they have put all at stake upon it; and it is no ways probable that they so much as desire to comprehend <HI>Vermont</HI> in their jurisdiction abstractly considered from it, for the haired subsist∣ing between them and those inhabitans, is similar to the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>American</HI> aversion.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more repugnant to the polity and genius of that government, than to extend their jurisdiction as aforesaid, on any other terms, but to engross the lands, and vassalage its inhabitants. To illustrate this proposition, we will suppose this territory to be included in the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York;</HI> and likewise, that it was populated, and the inhabitants held their property in that equal man∣ner which they do at present; or as is common in the <HI>New England</HI> states, which will be the case, pro∣vided the right of soil be held under the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grants; this would make a discord in the go∣vernment, and be a standing reproach to the inslaved part of the state; from whence animceities and strife would constantly arise, as one party would be for slavery, while the other would be for liberty, which would imbroil the government, and end in a civil war; for their genius, polity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, spirit and manners, would be as diametrically opposed to each other as they now are, or as liberty is to slavery. A people so opposite to each other in civil, political, and we may add, religious sentiments, can never subsist long
<PB N="43" REF="016183_0043_0F9BCC360FE273B8"/>under the same government, for the demonstration whereof we appeal to the current history of man∣kind.</P>
<P>AND this the government of <HI>New-York</HI> have been very sensible of; and therefore have from first to last, exerted themselves to divide the disputed terri∣ritory into large patents among themselves and fa∣vorites, so as not to endanger their slavish mode of government, and avoid the difficulties before-men∣tioned, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to reduce those brave inha∣bitants to sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t to be their tenants; which, if they could once effect, their spirit would dwindle away and expire with liberty: but is it not altogether probable, that those inhabitants who have suffered so much from <HI>Yorkish</HI> and <HI>British</HI> tyranny, will yet take the field against the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> (it need be) and at the muzzle of their firelocks convince them of the independency of the state of <HI>Vermont;</HI> and that their said patents are no more than an intrusion on the right of the <HI>green Mountain bays.</HI></P>
<P>THIS the government of <HI>New-York</HI> are also ap∣prized of, and are therefore indefatigable in their applications to congress to procure a resolution pro∣hibiting the government of <HI>Vermont</HI> from any fur∣ther proceedings as such, and to decree, that the free citizens thereof, shall submit to the government of <HI>New-York:</HI> imagining, that in consequence of some such like resolve, that they may procure a suf∣ficient force from the united states, to carry into ex∣ecution the reduction of <HI>Vermont;</HI> an enterprise which their own militia see a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inclined to under∣take. Such sanguine expectations as these, from a
<PB N="44" REF="016183_0044_0F9BCC36ECB27D58"/>government which have been very sparing in pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he independency of the united states; and which have been wire-drawn into congress county by county; and which have afforded such great numbers of disaffected inhabitants to the common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; whole malignant influence hath probably done as much mischief and damage to the public weal, as the brave and virtuous exertions of their well affected inhabitants could do to forward and promote it. Nothing could be more romantic than for such a government to expect that the power of the united states should be exerted against their me∣ritorious friends the citizens of <HI>Vermont,</HI> to effect that which they had attempted with their militia, and were not able to accomplish on a trial of many years, while under the king of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and which at this time those citizens apprehended to be out of their power.</P>
<P>AT present the people of <HI>Vermont</HI> have no appre∣hensions that their brethren in the united states will so evilly requite them for their many important ser∣vices to the common cause, as to assist the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York</HI> to subjugate them to their des∣potism.</P>
<P>THE government of <HI>New-York</HI> never had a just right of jurisdiction over the territory of <HI>Vermont.</HI> It was obtained by their solicitation ex-parte, and without either the knowledge or approbation of the inhabitants, who as soon as opportunity permitted, remonstrated against it before the king and council; and furthermore complained of the oppressions of that government in appropriating their lands and possessions for the emolument of their favorite ad∣venturers.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="016183_0045_0F9BCC37905D2DB0"/>
HAD the government of <HI>New-York</HI> sanctified the base and illegal manner of acquiring a pretended legal claim of jurisdiction, by a virtuous and bene∣volent administration; and in stead of monopolizing the soil, had confirmed the prior grants under the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> clear of fees and expence; the inhabitants would probably, by degrees, have excused them, and reluctantly submitted to their government; but inasmuch as the reverse of this has taken place, and a premeditated design of usurpation hath uniformly manifested itself in acquiring the claim of jurisdicti∣on, and exercising the same; it ought therefore in justice to be considered as null and void from the beginning, on account of the illegal measures, false representations, and undue influence, under which it was obtained and excerised. Furthermore, tho' the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had ever so good and legal a claim to the jurisdiction, the mercenary, op∣pressive, and inhumane use which they have made of it considered abstractly, should in justice, and a∣greeable to the rules of sound policy, be a final bar against any further exercise thereof.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants on the west side of the range of green mountains, never pretended to associate or connect with the government of <HI>New-York</HI> in any sense whatsoever, but have managed their internal and external police wholly independent of them as has been before related: though that government have made use of every artifice and low cunning to intice and persuade them to it; <HI>viz.</HI> by proposing a confirmation of lands to certain persons which they thought to be fit instruments to inslave the rest;
<PB N="46" REF="016183_0046_0F9BCC3853DAC380"/>commissions civil and military were likewise pro∣posed to some with like views, but the main body of the people were virtuous; and not only so, they had not the offer of either a confirmation of their lands or a commission to every of them; and it is most probable, that these offers which were actually made were fallacious; and that if the said govern∣ment had been confirmed, the proposed favorites would have shared much the same fate as is propa∣ble the tories would have done in consequence of the subjugation of the country at large by the go∣vernment of <HI>Britain.</HI> However, there were a num∣ber of depraved and mean spirited rascals which bit at the bait, and would probably have assisted that designing government of land clenchers, to divide the people, and finally inslaved them, had not the integrity and heroism of the green mountain boys prevented it, making it dangerous for any to ex∣cept such commission, or secure his farm on the ru∣in of his neighbours. Nevertheless the same sort of intrigues more or less took place on the east side of the said range of mountains: the counties of <HI>Cum∣berland</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI> were erected, and for a time partly established under the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> and in violation of the then king's authority, but injustice and oppression reigned to such an into∣lerable degree, that strife and opposition to the go∣vernment was the consequence which finally termi∣nated in the <HI>Westminster</HI> massacre on the 4th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, which put a final period to the grand usurpation of the government of <HI>New-York</HI> on the east side of the range of green mountains, and the main body of the people from that time till now,
<PB N="47" REF="016183_0047_0F9BCC3B49BF54B0"/>have reprobated the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and have not suffered a court to be convened and held in either of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose counties, under the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York</HI> ever since, though that government have to this day been carrying on some of their fomer cunning at <HI>Brattleborough,</HI> and a few other towns si∣tuate in the south east corner of this state.</P>
<P>AT the time the government of <HI>New-York</HI> con∣federated with the other states, the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont</HI> had formed their constitution, elected their chief, and other magistrates, and were in full pos∣session of government; and as they were free and unconnected with any state or body politic, had a just right so to do. This right they received from nature, nor were they beholden to the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York</HI> or any other power short of the <HI>omnipotent. New-Hampshire</HI> had forsaken and whol∣ly neglected them, and <HI>New-York</HI> tyrannized over them as much as they possibly could, (or dare) and they were a people between the heavens and the earth, as free as is possible to conceive any people to be; and in this condition they formed government upon the true principles of liberty and natural right; nor can the government of <HI>NewYork</HI> acquire any right of jurisdiction over them in consequence of confederating with the other free states of <HI>Ame∣rica;</HI> inasmuch as the state of <HI>Vermont</HI> was at that time not only independent of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> but of any and every of the nuited states.</P>
<P>THE royal adjudication of the boundary line afore-mentioned, was temporary in its nature, and arbitrary in its extention and conveyed nothing of the nature of a charter, grant, or permanent juris∣diction
<PB N="48" REF="016183_0048_0F9BCC3B5803B868"/>to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> but receiv∣ed its life and spirit by a mistical communication which it may be supposed to have every moment from the sovereign will of the royal adjudicator; from that source only this line crew all its support, as the branch does from the vine from whence it springs; and the declaration of independence cut∣ing the vital union, occasioned this line like a lamp to go out which exhausted of oil and leave no tra∣ces of its existence; from which moment the ima∣ginary claim of the <HI>New-Yorkish</HI> jurisdiction over the territory of <HI>Vermont</HI> expired, and the inhabitants thereof reverted to a state of nature. Thus it ap∣pears, that the government <HI>New-York</HI> 1stly forfeit∣ed their claim of jurisdiction by the illegal measures made use of in acquiring it. And 2dly, by the il∣legal and oppressive exercise of it. And 3dly and last∣ly, they have lost it by the annihilation of the <HI>English</HI> king's authority in consequence of the late revo∣lution, by which means the said adjudicated op∣pressive jurisdictional line became null and void to all parties, and is as though it had not been.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, this frontier country was under the greatest necessity of forming government; the inhabitants were obliged to exercise not only an in∣ternal policy among themselves, but an external po∣licy against foreign invasions; this they dare not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rust to the management of the government of <HI>New-York;</HI> who, we have but very little reason to doubt, would rejoice to have had the inhabitants cut off, that their lands might fall into their hands; an ob∣ject which they have been unsuccessfully pursuing for many years.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="016183_0049_0F9BCC3C17658080"/>
THE government of the infant state was, as it were, in <HI>embryo,</HI> when the haughty general <HI>Eurgoyne</HI> was penetrating the country; his spacious procla∣mation filled the air with a tyrants awe; intimidated the weak, the servile and base, but inraged the strong, the generous and the brave. Mean while the coun∣cil of the new state was very indefatigable in form∣ing designs against him; not only by forming their own militia into regular battalions under brave of∣ficers in order to oppose him, but by exciting the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> to assist them: while these matters were transecting, general <HI>Schuyler</HI> or∣dered the militia of this state to march to <HI>Saratoga,</HI> but government would not permit it, inasmuch as they apprehended that <HI>Bennington</HI> and its vicinity was an object of destruction by the enemy. How∣ever the brave general STARK with his detachment arrived at a lucky moment, and being chearfully joined by the green mountain boys, fell on the ene∣my with relentless fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which terminated in the two memorable and glorious battles of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and was the first check to the progress of a formi∣dable enemy; which proved the salvation of the new state, and had its salutary influence on the pending cause of the independent states of <HI>America</HI> at large, and is a striking proof of the good policy of assuming government.</P>
<P>ANY one who is acquainted with mankind, and things, must know that it would be impracticable to manage the political matters of this country without the assistance of civil government.

They could not enjoy domestic peace and security, considered abstractly, from a <HI>British</HI> war and <HI>Yorkish</HI> usurpation, without civil regulations; the two last considerations do in the most urgent manner excite them to strengthen and confirm the government set up by the consent, approbation and authority of the people, which is the fountain of all temporal power, and from which the citizens of <HI>Ver∣mont</HI> have already experienced such signal advanta∣ges. This puts them on an equal footing with their <HI>NewYork</HI> adversaries, and will finally enable them to baffle all their machinations and devices which nothing else can possibly do.</P>
<P>USURPATION and injustice was the primary cause of the separation and revolt of the <HI>English American</HI> colonies from <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and this was also their grand reason and justification for so doing; and con∣sequently the ground of their right to independency. These reasons are abundently conclusive and satis∣factory, as exhibitted by congress at large; and there appears to be a great degree of similarity in this controversy with the <HI>British</HI> government with that of <HI>Vermont</HI> against the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> except in this respect, that the territory of <HI>Vermont</HI> was never under the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York;</HI> although by fraud, injustice, and the conniv∣ing of the <HI>British</HI> court, they procured a royal order, purporting such a claim; which, in reality, origi∣nated from a complication of interested and tyran∣nical views, between them and the <HI>British</HI> court; the latter promoted and extended the power and influence of the former in <HI>America,</HI> to promote and aid in the subjugation of it; (for at that time the
<PB N="51" REF="016183_0051_0F9BCC3D906F65C0"/>projection was forming) and it is well known that <HI>New-York</HI> was their favorite government; and it hardly admits a dispute but that the intrinsic cause of the royal extension of the jurisdiction was to cor∣roborate the designs which have since been attempt∣ed against <HI>America;</HI> this and the <HI>Quebec</HI> bill was of a piece, and the motive of their extention the same, to more effectually bribe them governments to their interest, as subsequent and reciprocal transactions may more fully evince.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed with the parallel. The <HI>British</HI> government claimed an exclusive right of taxing the colonies in all cases whatsoever; such a prerogative would unavoidably have terminated finally in abject slavery, as has been fully illustrated by many inge∣nious writers, and verified by the universal experi∣ence of mankind; but the government of <HI>New-York</HI> took a more direct and immediate method, for at one blow they struck at the landed property of eve∣ry of the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> by stretching their subsequent interfering patents over them; this was more like a combination of land thieves, than a go∣vernment who covering the lands and lobors of the inhabitans, which, but a little before by iniquitous concerted measures at the <HI>British</HI> court (in stead of slaves) they proved to be denominated their sub∣jects. The mutilating the charter of the <HI>Massachu∣setts-Bay</HI> by the <HI>British</HI> parliament, was a high hand∣ed stride of arbitrary power, and struck the very nerves of liberty, but not so fatal as though they had appropriated the sod of the colony to new ad∣venturers, as in the instance of the interfering pa∣tents before mentioned; for nothing which can be
<PB N="52" REF="016183_0052_0F9BCC3E50A09F50"/>done to any people is capable of so effectually in∣slaving them, as the monopoly of their lands; when this is the case with a people, it is idle for them to dispute any more about liberty; for a sovereign nod of their landlord, cannot fail to over awe them, and by degrees erase the natural images of liberty from the mind, and make them grovel out a conteptable and miserable life.</P>
<P>THE detestable acts of outlawry passed the 9th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, by the legislative authority of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> particularly against the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont</HI> was, in substance, a positive declaration of war against them: by these acts they declared those inhabitants out of their protection; and abdicated the government, provided they may be supposed at that time to be possessed of any right thereto. The fact is, they appealed to arms; in this case they must effect the conquest of <HI>Vermont,</HI> or give up their pretentions to the government there∣of. The inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> on the 26th day of <HI>April</HI> following, published a declaration of a de∣fensive war against the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> as aforesaid, and warlike preparations were making on both sides; but the <HI>British</HI> invasion has procras∣tinated the determination of the matter till this time; and when this great and astonishing revolution shall be fully settled, ratified, and confirmed, it will be early enough for <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Vermont</HI> to proceed to the settlement of their controversy.</P>
<P>BUT to continue the parallel. Those acts of out∣lawry according to the express tenor thereof, im∣powered their courts of judicature, to award sen∣tence of death against any of those inhabitants as
<PB N="53" REF="016183_0053_0F9BCC3F11DB3A60"/>should be capitally indicted, although they were not personally before such court; and in like manner, any other sentence of punishment short of death, a∣gainst any of the said inhabitants which should be criminally indicted without any hearing, mearly on indictment itself; and also gave a full indemnifica∣tion to any and every of their subjects, for killing, maiming or wounding, those inhabitants which op∣posed such execution of law: in fine, the real de∣signs of these laws were to obtain possession of the farms of those inhabitants, or to make those who had the magnanimity to oppose them outlaws, and kill them where ever they could be found, that they might possess and enjoy the country; for such as they could not kill on the spot they only had to in∣dict capitally, and procure a sentence of death a∣gainst them, from their court of judicature, (which was easily done) and then every of their subjects or ruffians, became legal executioners; and from mo∣tives of public or private rewards, were at liberty, nay, under obligations to kill and exterpate them from the lands coveted, in any manner, and by any stratagem which might best serve such inhumane purposses; for all which savage cruelties, the par∣petrators had governmental indemnification; and thus the inhabitants (which they would fain have to be their subjects) were obliged either to give up their inheritance, or, in the <HI>Yorkish</HI> sense of the word become outlaws, fellons, rioters, &amp;c. and be sub∣jected to the dangers and hazards of the shocking evils before mentioned, which nothing but the dar∣ing spirit and unconquerable fortitude of the green mountain boys prevented taking place.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="016183_0054_0F9BCC3FD00EFE10"/>
MUCH more might be said as to the injustice, tyranny, oppression, and malevolence of these laws, but it is needless to animadvert any further on them, inasmuch as they carry their own refutation along with them; they are therefore subjoined verbatim to this vindication; with the original answer to the same, published soon after they made their public appearance, and submitted to the public considera∣tion; with this observation, that among the arbi∣trary edicts of the <HI>British</HI> government towards the colonies, none were equally oppressive to this, ex∣cept their declaration of war. Their act for trans∣porting the subjects of the colonies across the sea for trial for crimes committed or said to be com∣mitted in this country, was a daring stroke against the liberties of a free people; for though they were permitted a personal hearing, yet it was attended with great embarrassments, and insurmountable e∣vils and disadvantages, to be forced to a trial in a strange country, destitute of acquaintance, friends, or evidence, to make a defence; and probably with∣out money or credit; this would be a shocking con∣dition to be reduced to, especially by law, the ori∣ginal design of which, was to protect and promote the liberty and happiness of mankind. This bears a near resemblance to those acts of outlawry, tho' it is hardly so replete with malicious turpitude; and therefore a more certain destruction would have been the fate of the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> had those laws taken place; who, on a landjobbers indictment, and a landjobbing courts judgment, without hearing, to suffer death, or other punishment, by virtue of the laws of an infamous landjobbing legislature.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="016183_0055_0F9BCC408FC431A0"/>
THE local distance of <HI>Vermont</HI> from the seat of government in the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> is near four hundred and fifty miles from its extream parts, which would make government chargable and in∣convenient; and abstracted from all other consider∣ations, would constitute a sufficient reason for the independence of <HI>Vermont;</HI> nevertheless, provided those inhabitants were obliged to submit to the go∣vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> they would wish to have the distance ten times greater.</P>
<P>THE people of <HI>Vermont</HI> consider themselves as being virtually in union with the united states, from the time that they took possession of lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> and the garrisons depending thereon, in behalf of the united states, in <HI>May</HI> 1775; from which early period of the revolution, they have taken an active part with them, and have pursued invariable, the same object, <HI>viz.</HI> liberty; have participated in all their troubles; and with them have hazarded all that is worth living or dying for: such a combina∣tion of interests, and mutual co-operation, in secur∣ing and defending the same, constitutes the very nature and essence of union and confederation, nor can there be more than a meer formal declaration requisite to fully establish a confederation between them.</P>
<P>AND <HI>lastly.</HI> A confederation of the state of <HI>Ver∣mont</HI> with the other free and independent states, can∣not fail of being attended with salutary consequen∣ces to the confederacy at large, for ages yet to come. What a nursery of hardy soldiers may in future be nourished and supported in this fertile country, (which is one hundred and fifty miles in length, and
<PB N="56" REF="016183_0056_0F9BCC41504DA138"/>near sixty in breadth,) stimulated with the spirit of liberty, having a perfect detestation and abhorrence of arbitrary power, from the exertions whereof they have suffered so much evil; will instill the princi∣ples of liberty and social virtue in their children, which will be perpetuated to future generations: their climate and interior remove from the sea coast, will naturally be productive of a laborious life, by which means they will be in great measure exempt∣ed from luxury and effeminacy, and be a valuable support to the rising empire of the <HI>new world.</HI></P>

<P>MR. <HI>Brush,</HI> (in behalf of Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> chair∣man) from the grand committee, reporter, that he was directed by the said committee, to make the following report to the house, <HI>viz.</HI> That the said committee having taken into consideration, the petition of <HI>Benjamin Hough,</HI> in behalf of himself, and many of his majesty's subjects, inhabiting the county of <HI>Charlottes,</HI> and the north-eastern district of the county of <HI>Albany;</HI> complaining of many acts of outrage, cruelty, and oppression, committed against their persons and properties, by the <HI>Bennington</HI> MOP, and the dangers and injuries to which they are daily exposed, and imploring that this house will take them under their protection, and secure them a∣gainst future violence; and the said committee, having also duly considered the several proofs and depositions presented in support of the truth of the said petition, do therefore resolve.</P>
<P N="1">1, THAT it appears to this committee, that there at present prevails in part of the county of <HI>Charlottee,</HI> and in the north-eastern district of the county of <HI>albany,</HI> a dangerous and destructive spirit of riot and licentiousness, subversive of all order and good government; and that it is become an intole∣rable grievance, which requires immediate redress.</P>
<P N="2">2, RESOLVED, That it appears to this com∣mittee, that many acts of outrage, cruelty, and oppres∣sion
<PB N="58" REF="016183_0058_0F9BCCD2A691CB68"/>have been there perpetrated by a number of lawless persons, calling themselves the <HI>Bennington</HI> MOP, who have seized, insulted, and terrified several magistrates and other civil officers, so that they dare not exercise their respective functions; risqued pri∣soners for debt, assumed to themselves military com∣mands, and judicial power; burned and demolished the houses and property, and beat and abused the persons of many of his majesty's subjects, expel∣led them from their possessions, and put a period to the administration of justice, and spread terror and destruction through that part of the country which is exposed to their oppression.</P>
<P N="3">3, RESOLVED, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the complainants before this house and others, who inhabit part of that colony, and from respect to government, will not countenance or be concerned in the said riotous proceedings, are exposed from the violence of the rioters to eminent danger both in persons and properties; and that they stand in need of immediate protection and suc∣cour.</P>
<P N="4">4, RESOLVED, That it appears to this com∣mittee, that <HI>Ethan Allen, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, Robert Cochran, Peleg Sunderland, Silvanus Brown, James Breakenridge,</HI> and <HI>John Smith,</HI> are principal ring-lead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of, and actors in the riots and disturbances aforesaid; and that it is therefore the opinion of this committee, that an humble address be presented to his excellency, desiring that he would be pleased to issue a proclamation, offering a reward of fifty pounds for apprehending and securing any or either of the persons above named, in his majesty's

<P>MR. <HI>Nathan Clark,</HI> chairman of the committee of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers aforesaid, ordered the clerk to read the resolves and votes aforesaid, to the general committee, which was accordingly read sun∣dry times, and the following draught being present∣ed in answer thereto, to the publick meeting; seven persons were selected and chosen out of the said ge∣neral committee to examine the same, and report their opinion thereon, which here follows.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="opinion">
<P>WHEN we consider the numberless troubles, and almost insurmountable difficulties which our
<PB N="60" REF="016183_0060_0F9BCCD39DD96B20"/>infant settlements have been forced to struggle with since its first beginning, which have been occasion∣ed by an unequal and biassed administration of law, ever since our unhappy misfortune of being annexed to a government in which the interest of the greater part of the leading gentlemen thereof are in di∣rect opposition to our's. The tyrannical mea∣sures they take to enslave us, (we hope) will not fad to justify us in the following arguments and resolves thereon; for we think it an intolerable hardship, and piece of inhuman cruelty, that we can∣not be said to give sufficient proof of our loyalty and obedience to government but at the resignation of our whole fortunes, in the purchase and improve∣ment of which, we have suffered an infinity of hard∣ship. While we view the spirit of the general as∣sembly in their resolves, we cannot but reflect with some regret, on what may of consequence prove the result (without an alteration) of their present opini∣on; but there are scarce any circumstances that en∣tirely exclude hope; therefore we are not yet in total despair; for this moment we happily call to mind, that the general assembly of the same pro∣vince, about two years ago, did annex all that part of the <HI>Bay</HI> province west of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, to that UNLIMITED county of <HI>Albany;</HI> but their ava∣ricious grappling not being of a sufficient strength for such an unreasonable burthen, it failed, by which they lost their ideal booty.</P>
<P>THE reader will doubtless observe, that in the resolves of the assembly aforesaid, there is not a sin∣gle word mentioned in regard to the title of the land contested for, but that they level all their
<PB N="61" REF="016183_0061_0F9BCCD4569A7020"/>spleen, and point all their malice at notorious riot∣ers, as they call them, and make a pretended shew and figure, as though they were great sticklers for good order and government; although at the same time every person of common sense, who has had any acquaintance and knowledge of the controversy, absolutely knows, that out goodly and, with the la∣bour thereon, is the only subject matter and grand object of the whole controversy; and give the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> but that, and the matter would be accom∣plished to their eternal satisfaction; and it is pre∣sumed the words riotous disorderly, licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grantees and present occupants, for the whole course of the succeeding century.</P>
<P>FOR the truth of the case is, the executors of the law, are most (if not all) of them the pretended claimants to the lands whereon the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grantees and occupants dwell; and their judgments on writs of ejectment, brought by the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees, have not hitherto failed to correspond with their imaginary interests; but were they honest men they would not undertake to be judges in their own case, or in any other wherein the resolution thereof would make a president for their own, espe∣cially in title of land wherein judge and plaintiff are connected in one common interest: such a dis∣tribution of law is contrary to the law of reason and nations.</P>
<P>THEREFORE our case stands thus, if we submit to their execution of law, and become obedient and submissive subjects of their designing government, we must soon yield to be their tenants and slaves;
<PB N="62" REF="016183_0062_0F9BCCD5107DD510"/>and we cannot see reason to conform to any law which will apparently bring us and our posterity into bon∣dage, or manifestly deprive us of our property; but inasmuch as we boldly adhere to the maintenance of our property, which to us is very precious as it would be to the <HI>New-Yorkers,</HI> was it in their hands. We find it is immediately recommended to the go∣vernor of the province, by the general assembly, to issue his proclamation, offering therein image <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of money to apprehend those notorious rioters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as they are pleased to stile them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must indeed be shocking to common sense when the reader comes to observe what notorious complaints, and most horrid accusations are set forth in the resolves of the general assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> mentioned in the fore part of this paper, against thousands of hard labour∣ing, industrious, honest peasants, who are in truth loyal subjects of the crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for their violations of law and government; when at the same time the following express orders from his most sa∣cred majesty to that litigious government of <HI>New-York,</HI> will plainly show, that they do not make the least hesitation to rebel and act in direct opposition to the authority of the crown; when (as in the pre∣sent case) they shew a disposition to take advantage of the minor part of those under their government, and throw them into contention and disorder, and thereby build their fortunes on the ruin of the pre∣tended aggressors; and all under the specious pre∣tence of good order and government, which is in fact what they eventually aim at, as will appear by the following order.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this prohibition, and one or two more of the same general import, and from the same authority, the government of <HI>New-York</HI> have lapped their patents on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> charters, and in consequence thereof demand at
<PB N="64" REF="016183_0064_0F9BCCD69621B1F8"/>common law, the land on which the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grantees and occupants dwell; and from hence has arisen the numerous troubles and disturbances between the government of <HI>New-York</HI> and its dis∣contented subjects, the settlers under <HI>New-Hamp∣shire.</HI> This has alto been the source of all licen∣tiousness and confusion, riotousness, &amp;c. complained of by that government against the settlers afore∣said.</P>
<P>AND whereas the true state of our grants hath been already laid before the worthy lords of the board of trade and plantation, and they having con∣sidered and wisely deliberated upon its several cir∣cumstance, did on the third day of <HI>December,</HI> A. D. 1772, make their report in favor of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grantees, to his most gracious majesty, whose royal confirmation we daily expect; and on the cre∣dit and good faith of this report, many hundreds of industrious (and many of them wealthy) families have purchased and moved upon the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grants, nothing doubting of that title.</P>
<P>WE therefore humbly report to the said general committee of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, as our opinion, 1. That as we over have, so for the future we will remain loyal and dutiful subjects to our most rightful sovereign GEORGE the third, and de∣mean ourselves agreeable to the good and wholesome laws of the realm, and fight for the dignity of his majesty's crown and government at all times when there may be a call for it, viewing him as our poli∣tical father, and relying on him to be protected in our property.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="65" REF="016183_0065_0F9BCCD7518DA318"/>
2. THAT as we purchased our lands of one of his majesty's governors, and on the good faith of the crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we are determined to maintain those grants, against all opposition, until his majesty's royal pleasure shall be known in the premises.</P>
<P>AND whereas we have never made any further resistance to government, than the law of self-pre∣servation, which the law of GOD and nature enjoyns on every intelligent, wise and understanding being; we therefore are fully of the opinion to resolve,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT such of the magistrates and govern∣mental authority of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> as have pursued, and have been accessary in the scheme of indicting our friends and neighbours as rioters; and have by intrigue and stratagem of various sorts, endeavored to take them, and punish them as cri∣minals; thereby to dishearten and terrify the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers to that degree, that they may tame∣ly be disinherited; have acted contrary to the spi∣rit and design of the good and righteous laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which, under a just administration, never fail to secure the liberty and property of the subject; are thereby guilty of great inhumanity to its respective subjects. We therefore resolve, That as a country, we will stand by, and defend our friends and neighbours so indicted, at the expence of our lives and fortunes. And we would recom∣mend it to the general assembly of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to wait the determination of his majesty, relative to the title of those lands, and desist from taking us as rioters, to prevent the unhappy conse∣quences that may result from such an attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="016183_0066_0F9BCCD81BC06A78"/>
AND fourthly, and lastly, resolved, That for the future, every necessary preparation be made, and that our inhabitants hold themselves in readi∣ness, at a minute's warning, to aid and defend such friends of our's, who, for the merit to the great and general cause, are falsely denominated rioters; but that we will not act any thing more or less, but on the'defensive, and always encourage due execution of law in civil cases, and also in criminal prosecuti∣ons, that are so indeed; and that we will assist, to the utmost of our power, the officers appointed for that purpose.</P>
<P>THE foregoing arguments, narrations and re∣solves, being laid before the general committee of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, and was read sundry times, and carefully examined; and after mature deliberation, Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> chairman, put the votes to tryal, whether the foregoing was approved of as an answer to the resolves of the general assembly of the province of <HI>New-York?</HI> and it was passed in the af∣firmative. And it was furthermore the advice of this committee, that the foregoing be forthwith ex∣hibited in the public papers, to the intent that all officers, magistrates, and persons whatsoever, may know, that if they presume to take the rioters afore∣said, they do it on their peril.</P>

<P><HI>WHEREAS a spirit of riot and licentiousness has of late prevailed in some parts of the counties of</HI> Char∣lotte <HI>and</HI> Albany, <HI>and many acts of outrage and cru∣elty have been perpetrated by a number of turbulent men, who assembling from time to time in arms, have seized, insulted and menaced several magistrates, and other ci∣vil officers, so that they dare not execute their functions—rescued prisoners for debt—assumed to themselves military commands, and judicial powers—burned and demolished houses and property, and beat and abused the persons of many of his majesty's subjects—expelled others from their possessions—and finally, have put a period to the admi∣nistration of justice within, and spread terror and de∣struction throughout that part of the country which is exposea to their oppression: Therefore, for the prevent∣ing and suppressing such riots and tumults, and for the more speedy and effectual punishing the offenders there∣in.</HI></P>

<P>AND that if the persons so unlawfully, riotously and tumultusly assembled, or any of them, shall happen to be killed, maimed, or hurt, in the dispers∣ing, seizing or apprehending them, by reason of their resisting the persons so dispersing, seizing, or appre∣hending, or endeavouring to disperse, seize, or ap∣prehend them; that then every such justice of the peace, sheriff, under sheriff, coroner or constable, and all and singular persons aiding and assisting to them, or any of them, shall be freed, discharged, and indemnified, as well against the king's majesty, his heirs and successors, as against all and every o∣ther person and persons, of, for, or concerning the killing, maiming, or hurting of any such person or persons so unlawfully, riotously, and tumultously assembled, that shall happen to be so killed, maim∣ed, or hurt as aforesaid.</P>

<P N="6">6.

<HEAD>From the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Gazette, No. 915. REMARKS, &amp;c. on some late Laws passed in <HI>New-York.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS excellency governor <HI>Tryon</HI> in conformity to the addresses of the general assembly of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> having on the 9th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, with the advice of his council, issued his proclama∣tion, offering therein large sums of money for the purpose of apprehending and imprisoning the fol∣lowing persons, viz. <HI>Ethan Allen, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, Robert Cochrain, Peleg Sunderland, Silvanus Brown, James Breakenridge,</HI> and <HI>James Smith.</HI></P>
<P>ANA whereas his excellency the governor, by the same proclamation, hath strictly enjoined and com∣manded all magistrates, justices of the peace, sheriffs, and other civil officers of the counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> to be active and vigilent in apprehending and imprisoning the persons above-named; and we the aforesaid persons, who have hereunto subscrib∣ed, being conscious that our cause is good and equi∣table in the sight of GOD, and all unprejudiced and honest men, are determined at all events, to main∣tain and defend the same 'till his majest's pleasure shall be known concerning the validity of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants.—And we now proclaim to the
<PB N="80" REF="016183_0080_0F9BCCE416627800"/>public, not only for ourselves but for the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grantees, and occupants in general; that the spring and moving cause of our opposition to the government of <HI>New-York</HI> was self-preservation, <HI>viz.</HI> Firstly, the preservation and maintaining of our property: And secondly, since that govern∣ment is so incensed against us, therefore it stands us in hand to defend our lives; for it appears by a late set of laws passed by the legislature thereof that the lives and property of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers are manifestly struck at; but, that the public may rightly understand the essence of the controversy, we now proclaim to those law-givers, and to the world, that if the <HI>New York</HI> patentees will remove their patents that have been subsequently lapped and laid on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> charters, and quiet us in our possessions, agreeable to his majesty's di∣rections, and suspend those criminal prosecutions against us for being rioters (as we are unjustly de∣nomination) then will our settlers be orderly and submissive subjects to government; but be it known to that despotic fraternity of law-makers and law∣breakers, that we will not be fooled or frighted out of our property; they have broke over his majesty's express prohibitions, in patenting those lands, and when they act in conformity to the regal authority of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it will be soon enough for us to obey them. It is well known by all wise and sensi∣ble persons in the neighbouring governments, (that have animadverted on the controversy) that their pretended zeal for good order and government, is fallacious, and that they aim at the lands and la∣bours of the grantees and settlers aforesaid; and
<PB N="81" REF="016183_0081_0F9BCCE4CEED22F0"/>that they subvert the good and wholesome laws of the realm, to corroborate with, and bring about their vile and mercenary purposes.</P>
<P>AND, inasmuch as the malignity of their disposi∣tion towards us, hath flamed to an immeasurable and murtherous degree, they have in their new∣fangled laws, calculated for the meridian of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, passed the 9th of <HI>March,</HI> 1774; so calculated them, as to correspond with the depra∣vedness of their minds and morals; in them laws, they have exhibited their genuine pictures. The emblems of their insatiable, avaricious, overbearing, inhuman, barbarous, and blood-guiltiness of dispo∣sition and intention is therein portraited in that transparent image of themselves, which cannot fail to be a blot and an infamous reproach to them, to posterity.—We cannot suppose that every of his majesty's council, or that all the mem∣bers of the general assembly were active in passing so bloody and unconstitutional a set of laws; undoubt∣edly, some of them disapproved thereof; and it is altogether possible, that many that were active in making the law, were imposed upon by false repre∣sentations, and acted under mistaken views of doing honor to government; but be this as it will, it ap∣pears that there was a majority. and it has been too much the case with the government, for a num∣ber of designing schemers, and land-jockeys, to rule the same. Let us take a view of their former nar∣row and circumbscribed boundaries, and how, that by legerdemain, bribery and deceptions of one sort or other, they have extended their domain far and wide; they have wrangled with and encroached on
<PB N="82" REF="016183_0082_0F9BCCE74A7EAD10"/>their neighbouring governments, and have used all manner of deceit and fraud to accomplish their de∣signs: their tenants groan under their usury and oppression; and they have gained, as well as merit∣ed disapprobation and abhorrence of their neigh∣bours, and the innocent blood they have already shed, calls for heaven's vengeance on their guilty heads; and if they should come forth in arms against us thousands of their injured and dissatisfied neighbours in the several governments, will join with us, to cut off, and extirpated such an execrable race from the face of the earth!</P>
<P>THIS piece is not supposed to contain a full an∣swer to the new constructed laws aforesaid; for such a large <HI>two year old,</HI> hath never before been seen in <HI>America,</HI> it being of an enormous and monstrous birth; nor is it supposed to give the legislators their full characters: but so much may suffice for the present. To quote the laws, and make remarks thereon, would be matter sufficient for a volume: However, we will yet make some short abservations,</P>
<P N="1">1st, NEGATIVELY, it is not a law for the pro∣vince of <HI>New-York</HI> in general, but,</P>
<P N="2">2d, POSITIVELY, it is a law but for part of the counties of <HI>Charlotte</HI> and <HI>Albany;</HI> viz. Such parts thereof as are covered with the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> char∣ters; and it is well known those grants compose but a minor part of the inhabitants of the said province; and we have not presentative in that assembly. The first knowledge we had of said laws, was the com∣pletion of them; which informed us, that if we as∣sembled, three or more of us together, to oppose (that which they all legal) authority, we shall be
<PB N="83" REF="016183_0083_0F9BCCE7D807B008"/>adjudged felons, and suffer the pains of death; and that same fraternity of plotters knew, as well as we, and the generally of the people in the adjacent co∣lonies, that they have for a number of years last past, endeavored to exercise such a course of what they call law, that had they not been opposed by the peo∣ple of these grants (called the MOB) in the executing the same, they would, before this time, have been in possession of that territory, for which the laws a∣foresaid are calculated. Therefore the case stands thus: If we oppose civil officers in taking possession of our farms, we are, by these laws, denominated fe∣lons; or if we defend our neighbours who have been indicted rioters, only for defending our property; we are likewise adjudged felons. In fine, every op∣position to their monarchial government is deemed felony, and at the end of every such sentence, there is the word DEATH! And the same laws further impowered the respective judge, provided any persons, to the number of three, or more, that shall oppose any Magistrate, or other civil officer, and be not taken, that after a legal warning of seven days, if they do not come and yield themselves up to cer∣tain officers appointed for the purpose of securing them; then it shall be lawful for the judges afore∣said, to award execution of DEATH, the same as tho' he or they had been convicted or attainted before a proper court of judicature, &amp;c. The candid reader will doubtless observe, that the diabolical design of this law, is to obtain possession of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grants, or to make the people that defend them out-laws, and so kill them whenever they can catch them.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="016183_0084_0F9BCCE8919F4AA0"/>
THOSE bloody law-givers know we are necessitated to oppose their execution of law, where it points directly at our property, or give up the same: but there is one thing is matter of consolation to us, viz. that printed sentences of death will not kill us when we are at a distance; and if the executioners ap∣proach us, they will be as likely to fall victims to death as we: and that person, or country of per∣sons, are cowards indeed, if they cannot as manfully fight for their liberty, property and life, as villains can do to deprive them thereof.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New-York</HI> schemers accuse us with many things, part of which are true, and part not.—With respect to rescuing prisoners for debt, it is <HI>false.</HI> As to assuming judicial powers, we <HI>have not,</HI> except a well-regulated combination of the people to de∣fend their just rights, may be called so. As to forming ourselves into military order, and assuming military commands, the <HI>New-York</HI> possies, and mi∣litary preparations, oppressions, &amp;c. <HI>obliged us to it.</HI> Probably Mess. <HI>Duane, Kemp,</HI> and <HI>Banyer,</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> will not discommend us for so expedient a preparation; more especially since the decrees of the 9th of <HI>March,</HI> are yet to be put in execution: and we flatter ourselves, upon occasion, we can muster as good a regiment of mark's-men and scalpers, as <HI>America</HI> can afford; and we now give the gentlemen above-named, together with Mr. <HI>Brush,</HI> and Col. <HI>Ten Broeck,</HI> and in fine, all the land-jobbers of <HI>New-York,</HI> an invitation to come and view the dexterity of our regiment; and we cannot think of a better time for that purpose, than when the executioners come to kill us, by virtue of the authority their
<PB N="85" REF="016183_0085_0F9BCCE9526B6C70"/>judges have lately received to award and sentence us to death in our absence. There is still one more no∣table complaint against us, viz. That we have in∣sulted and manaced several magistrates, and other civil officers, so that they dare not execute their re∣spective functions. this is <HI>true</HI> so far as it relates to the magistrates. But the public should be inform∣ed, what the functions of those magistrates are: they are commissioned for the sole purpose of doing us all the harm and mischief they possibly can, thro' their administration and influence; and that they might be subservient to the wicked designs of the <HI>New-York</HI> chemers. These are their functions; and the public need no further proof than the consider∣ation that they are the tools of those extravagant law-makers; and it must be owned, they acted with great judgment, in chusing the most infernal instru∣ments for their purpose,</P>
<P>DRACO, the <HI>Athenian</HI> lawgiver, caused a number of laws (in many respect; analogous to those we have been speaking of) to be <HI>written</HI> in blood. But our modern <HI>Draco</HI>'s determine to have their's <HI>verified</HI> in blood. They well know we shall more than <HI>three,</HI> nay, more than <HI>three times three hundred,</HI> assemble together, if need be, to maintain our common cause, till his majesty determines who shall be and remain the owners of the land in contest. "<HI>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemoth, thy God, giveth thee to pos∣sess?</HI>" So will we possess that which the Lord our God (and King) giveth us to possess.</P>
<P>AND lastly, we address ourselves to the people of the counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> which inhabit to the westward of, and are situated contiguous to the <HI>New Hampshire</HI> grants.</P>

GENTLEMEN, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS, PROVIDENCE having allotted and fixed the bounds of our habitations in the same vicinity, which, toge∣ther with the intercourse of trade and commerce, hath formed an almost universal acquaintance and tie of friendship between us, and hath laid such a foundation of knowledge, that your people in gene∣ral cannot but be sensible that the title of our land is in reality the bone of contention; and that as a people, we behave ourselves orderly; and are indus∣trious, and honestly disposed; and pay just reference to order and good government; and that we mean no more by that which is called the MOB, but to de∣fend our just rights and properties. We appeal to the gentlemen merchants, to inform whether our people in general, do not exert themselves to pay their just debts; and whether ever they have been hindered by the country's MOB, in the collection of their dues. But as the magistrates, sheriffs, under∣sheriffs, coroners, and constables of the respective counties that hold their posts of honor and profit under our bitter enemies, we have a jealousy, that some of them may be induced (to recommend them∣selves to those on whom they are dependant, and for the wages of unrighteousness, offered by proclamati∣on) to presume to apprehend some of us, or our friends: We therefore advertise such officers, and all persons whatsoever, that we are resolved to inflict <HI>immediate death</HI> on whomsoever may attempt the same. And provided any of us or our party shall be taken, and we have not notice sufficient to relieve them, or whether we relieve them or not, we are resolved to surround such person or persons, whether at his or
<PB N="87" REF="016183_0087_0F9BCCEAD2B30C60"/>their own house or houses, or any where that we can find him or them, and <HI>shoot such person or persons dead.</HI> And furthermore, that we will <HI>kill</HI> and <HI>destroy</HI> any person or persons whomsoever, that shall <HI>presume</HI> to be accessary, aiding or assisting in taking any of us as aforesaid; for by these presents we give any such disposed person or persons to understand, that, altho' they have a licence by the law aforesaid to <HI>kill</HI> us; and an "indemnification" for such murther from the same authority; yet they have no indemnification for so doing, from the <HI>green mountain boys;</HI> for our lives, liberties and properties, are as verily precious to us, as to any of the king's subjects; and we are as loyal to his majesty or his government, as any subjects in the province: but if the governmental authority of <HI>New-York</HI> will judge in their own case, and act in opposition to that of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and insist upon <HI>killing</HI> us to take possession of our "vine∣yards" come on, we are ready for a game of scalping with them; for our martial spirits glow with bitter indignation, and consumate fury, to blast their in∣fernal projections.</P>
<P>IT may be the reader, not having seen the law referred to in this piece, and not being thoroughly acquainted with the long and spirited conflict that hath subsisted between the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> nor of the progressive, ar∣bitrary, and monopolizing disposition of the court party of the latter of those provinces; may be apt to imagine that the spirit of this writing is too se∣vere, inasmuch as it destines whoever presumes to take us as felons or rioters, to immediate death; but let the wise consider the state of the cause.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="88" REF="016183_0088_0F9BCCEB9158E330"/>
1. PROVIDED we on our part be taken, we have by them laws the sentence of death already pro∣nounced against us, on proviso more than three of us assemble together to maintain and defend our pro∣perty, till his majesty determines the controver∣sy. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. MAY it be considered, that the legislative au∣thority of the province of <HI>New-York</HI> had no consti∣tutional right or power to make such laws, and consequently that they are null and void, from the nature and energy of the <HI>English</HI> constitution; there∣fore as they merit no place among the laws of the realm of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but are the arbitrary league and combination of our bitter and merciless enemies, who, to obtain our property, have inhumanly, bar∣barously, and maliciously, under the specious and hypocritical pretence of legal authority, and vene∣ration for order and government, laid a snare for our lives. Can the public censure us for exerting ourselves nervously to preserve our lives in so criti∣cal a situation? For by the laws of the province, into which we are unfortunately fallen, we cannot be protected in either property or life, except we give up the former to secure the latter; so we are resolved to maintain both, or to hazard or loose both.</P>
<P>FROM hence follows a necessary inference, That inasmuch as our property, nay, our lives, cannot be protected (but manifestly struck at) by the highest authority in the province to which we at present be∣long; therefore in the interim, while his majesty is determining the controversy, and till he shall inter∣pose his royal authority, and subject the authority
<PB N="89" REF="016183_0089_0F9BCCEC527236B8"/>aforesaid to their duty, or re-annex the district of disputed lands to the province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> or some way in his great wisdom and fatherly cle∣mency, put the distressed settlers under <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> on an equal footing with our brother subjects in his realm; we are under necessity of resisting, e∣ven unto blood, every person who may attempt to take us as felons or rioters as aforesaid; for in this case it is not resisting law, but only opposing force by force; therefore inasmuch as by the oppressions aforesaid, the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers are reduced to the disagreeable state of anarchy and confusion; in which state we hope for wisdom, patience and forti∣tude, till the happy hour his majesty shall graciously be pleased to restore us to the privileges of <HI>Eng∣lishmen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>AS the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> rely on their charters from that government as the pre∣dicate and ground of their title to the property of the land in contest; so, on the other hand, the claimants under
<PB N="91" REF="016183_0091_0F9BCCEDD817A9E0"/><HI>New-York,</HI> predicate and ground their title to the same land on the validity of their patents from <HI>New-York:</HI> This brings the point in issue between the respective claimants to this single question, namely, <HI>Which of the said governments conveyed the fee of the land in contest?</HI> For it is self-evident both could not. And up in exploring the controversy, and ani∣madverting on the merits of the different claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to stand the test, and adjudged valid, it will of necessity invali∣date the other. In the discussion of this subject, and searching into the merit of the respective claims, it is necessary to inspect into the validity of the grant from king CHARLES to the duke of YORK, from which foundation only, the government of <HI>New-York</HI> deduce their right of patenting the lands in contest; yet the matter of fact is, that neither the government of <HI>New-York</HI> as such, or any indi∣vidual therein, has ever had any conveyance of any land from the duke of <HI>York,</HI> nor doth any landlord or person whatever, in the government hold the fee or property of their land, by virtue of any convey∣ance from the duke of <HI>York;</HI> but they hold the fee of their lands on a very different footing, viz. by conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that king <HI>Charles</HI> gave to his brother <HI>James</HI> duke of <HI>York,</HI> the fee of the lands west of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the head of <HI>Delaware-Bay;</HI> and allowing the fee to be still vested in him, his heirs or assigns, upon this hypothesis no person in the province of <HI>New-York</HI> hath the fee or property of the land they pos∣sess, the fee remaining the property of the duke of <HI>York,</HI> his heirs or assigns. And further, upon the same
<PB N="92" REF="016183_0092_0F9BCCEE9064F5E0"/>principle, those identical patents under the seal of <HI>New-York,</HI> which were laid on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, are in their own nature, equally null and void, with all other conveyances of land in the said province which have been given by the crown, the fee thereof being vested in the duke of <HI>York,</HI> &amp;c. So that the grantees under <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> are both, upon this stating of the case, equally destitute of the fee of the land contested for: But, upon this stating, the grantees under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> have the argument of settlement, and oc∣cupation, and possession, on their side; which is abundantly sufficient to give the priority, and pre∣ference of title to them; so that neither the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York</HI> or their patentees, gain any thing by building their title on the said grants to the duke of <HI>York;</HI> for if there be any thing in it, it de∣feats their own title as well as that of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> proving too much for their purpose, or no∣thing at all. But, if the lands contained in the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant reverted back to the crown, then the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s patent became extinct, null, and absolutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the said reversion happened in consequence of the said duke's abdicating the throne—turning papist, or by any formal surrendery, or by any means whatever, provided the fee became revested in the crown, then the said charter became extinct, as aforesaid; so that whether the fee of the land in dispute still remains in the said duke of <HI>York,</HI> his heirs or assigns, or reverted, or was surrendered to the crown, none of all this will in the least justify the government of <HI>New-York</HI> or its patentees, in
<PB N="93" REF="016183_0093_0F9BCCF0EED63FE8"/>founding their pretensions of title to the lands afore∣said, by virtue of the aforesaid grant from king <HI>Charles</HI> to the duke of <HI>York.</HI> For, take the argu∣ment one way, and it overturns both the title of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> also, leaving the latter in occupation and possession of the disputed premises, and that only, being intirely destitute of the fee; and the <HI>New-York</HI> claimants destitute of the least colour of title whatsoever. But, take the argument the other way, viz. Provided the fee of the lands aforesaid reverted and been revested in the crown, then the said lands at the time of first granting were crown lands the same as though the duke of <HI>York</HI> had never existed. But the truth of the matter un∣doubtedly is this, the under proprietors all except <HI>William Penn,</HI> who had the several countries par∣celled out to them by the duke of <HI>York,</HI> which was contained in his grant; surrendered their charters to the crown, whereby <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> became royal governments: This then being the state of the case, the lands in dispute became crown lands, and the governor of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> as well as <HI>New-York</HI> crown officers, or king's agents, and it is of no consequence to the king which of his governors grants his land, if so be they be granted to and settled by loyal and industrious subjects, thereby adding to the revenue of the crown and en∣larging and strengthening the kingdom. This be∣ing presupposed, and admit for supposition only, that the governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> exceeded his proper limits in granting crown lands, must the grantees who have settled those lands, paid one of the crown officers for granting the same, and ex∣pended their ALL, in settling and cultivating his
<PB N="94" REF="016183_0094_0F9BCCF18F58F480"/>majesty's wilderness land, and who are truly loyal subjects, be turned off the said land by thousands, and reduced to starving poverty, together with their numerous families, because one of the crown officers either ignorantly or designingly imposed upon the people by granting crown lands over his bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more so as it can∣not be supposed that the subjects are capable judges of the jurisdiction of governments, and consequent∣ly there should be the greatest care taken to guard the subject from injury in all cases of this nature; the truth of which will more fully appear by the following considerations, viz. That notwithstand∣ing the supposed error in granting the said lands, yet the great end of the crown in granting of it is compleatly answered; and provided the subjects i. e. the settlers are quieted in the fee and possession of the said lands, they will not be injured, so that upon this hypothesis, neither king nor subject would sustain damage: Indeed no person in the realm could have just cause of complaint. True, the re∣spective governors of <HI>New-York</HI> may insinuate, that upon this state of the case, the governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> has cheated them out of their fees for granting the said lands—though it is evident, if crown officers are faithful to the king and subjects, they could take no more money for granting crown lands, than a reasonable compensation for their trou∣ble, and the other governor's being supposed to grant the lands, saves the said governor of <HI>New-York</HI> the trouble; so that the argument is brought to this single point only at last, that upon supposition the governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> exceeded his proper
<PB N="95" REF="016183_0095_0F9BCCF26234D9E8"/>limits in granting those lands, yet neither king nor subjects are injured, (provided the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> hold the fee of the said land as a∣bove) except the governors of <HI>New-York,</HI> and if they be supposed to be honest men, the trouble of grant∣ing the land would be equal to their fees had they granted it; so that they have not been injured a whit more in this case, than they be supposed to have injured the subjects by taking exorbitant fees for granting the same lands; which to them is no injury at all, but a providential check to the exer∣cise of their avarice. So that the respective gover∣nors of <HI>New-York,</HI> in an equitable sense, are no loos∣ers in this affair; or at most the privileges would be so very inconsiderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, especially when set in competition with the shocking and universal destruction that would overspread a large country of his majesty's good subjects, provided they be dispossessed of the lands aforesaid. This seems to be the genuine sequel of the argument, even upon the <HI>Yorker</HI>'s own stating it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION, II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not conceeded to on the part of the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> that the governor did in fact exceed his proper limits in granting those lands, the contrary will abundantly appear from the fol∣lowing considerations, viz. Before and at the time the said governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> granted those lands they were reputed to be within his jurisdicti∣on, this was the opinion of both learned and un∣learned, the wise as well as simple, thus is was uni∣versally
<PB N="96" REF="016183_0096_0F9BCCF3130A11B8"/>planed in all ancient and modern maps down to the year 1764, when, by royal determination, the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> was extended over this dis∣puted district of land. But the general opinion be∣fore this royal adjudication was, that the province of <HI>New-York</HI> extended its jurisdiction but twenty miles to the eastward from <HI>Hudson's</HI>-river, so general was this opinion, that the best maps of the two re∣spective provinces, and the history of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> adopted it as settled; it is of very great weight in the question to shew how universal this maxim was, and that the unprejudiced and accurate geo∣grapher Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> in his map composed so late as the year 1755, which with great propriety and certainty ascertains the same limits, this map has the more authority as it was according to the certificate of Mr. <HI>Pownal,</HI> secretary to the board of trade, and was undertaken with the approbation and at the re∣quest of the lords commissioners for trade and plan∣tation, and is chiefly composed from draughts, charts, and actual serveys of different parts of his majesty's colonies and plantions in <HI>America,</HI> great part of which have been since taken by their lord∣ships orders and transmitted to the office of the go∣vernors of said colonies. This twenty mile line was so far from being deemed unfavorable to <HI>New-York,</HI> that we find the commissioners from that province so late as the year 1767, made an offer to those of the <HI>Massachusett-Bay</HI> to let a line at twenty miles distance east of <HI>Hudson's</HI>-river be the division be∣tween their respective provinces, which the latter commissioners would not then agree to it, being thought by them too much in favor of <HI>New-York,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="016183_0097_0F9BCCF3D1E83A80"/>so little it seems did <HI>New-York</HI> commissioners con∣ceive their claim as far as <HI>Connecticut</HI> river could be supported.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is true in the year 1771 the province of <HI>New-York</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> public act of their general assem∣bly, did annex all that part of the province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> to the westward from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, to their county of <HI>Albany;</HI> and it is likewise true that in the year 1773, the governors of the re∣spective provinces met at <HI>Hartsord,</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and came to a mutual agreement to settle that line at twenty miles distance eastward from <HI>Hudson's</HI>-river, which was the hypothesis of that settlement, which hath since been ratified by his majesty.</P>
<P>THE report of the lords commissioners for planta∣tion affairs in 1753, states the following facts, from which is necessarily inferred that <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> ex∣tended its jurisdiction to the westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river,—"There are, says their lordships, about 60,000 acres of land situate on the west side of <HI>Connec∣ticut</HI>-river, which were purchased by private persons from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to whom the land had been laid out, by the government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> as an equivalent for two or three townships which the latter purchased from the former, this tract of land by the determination of the boundary line be∣tween the provinces of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts-Bay</HI> in 1739 is become a part of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI>"—Thus we have their lordships sen∣timents that the jurisdiction of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> ex∣tended over part of the very lands in contest, west∣ward of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, as long ago as the year 1739, at which time <HI>New-York</HI> never dreamed of
<PB N="98" REF="016183_0098_0F9BCCF49650EFB8"/>extending their claim to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river.—There is another glaring and indisputable evidence of the former western extent of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> viz. Re∣lative to sort <HI>Dummer</HI> which was built by the <HI>Bay</HI> province in 1724, and garrisoned at their expence a great number of years; but upon its being excluded from their jurisdiction by the settlement of the juris∣dictional line, between them and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in 1739, the <HI>Bay</HI> province represented to the govern∣ment at home, that the said district of land and fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> having been determined to be the property of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> they were no longer obliged to garrison and maintain it, and praying, that as it was necessary to the defence of the country, that <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> might be directed to support it. In con∣sequence of which, an order passed the king and council in 1744, that the governor and commander in chief of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> should forthwith move the assembly, in his majesty's name, to make a pro∣per provision for that service; and at the same time informing them that in case they refused to comply with so reasonable and necessary a proposal, his ma∣jesty would find himself under a necessity of restor∣ing that fort, with a proper district of land contigu∣ous thereto, to the province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> who cannot with justice be required to main∣tain a fort no longer within their boundary. In consequence of this, <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> did maintain this fort, and paid a demand of arrears for its main∣tainance, to the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI> In the mean time <HI>New-York</HI> was never a competitor for the bur∣then, willing as she is to enjoy the advantage of granting and engrossing the said lands.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="016183_0099_0F9BCCF551AB77D0"/>
THIS being the case, the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> by the royal decree, was obliged to main∣tain fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> and it being on the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and on this very identical district of land now in dispute, can that government be justly charged with granting lands in the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> when but a little before his majesty in council had adjudged the same lands to be in the said govern∣ment of <HI>New Hampshire</HI> and ordered them to de∣fend it, as by maintaining fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> &amp;c. Sure∣ly at that time <HI>New Hampshire</HI> did extend its juris∣diction westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river; otherwise the king had ordered the government of <HI>New-York</HI> to have maintained fort <HI>Dummer.</HI> Nothing can be more flagrantly evident than, that the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> had a right to grant crown lands where the crown compelled them to defend. From hence it appears, that the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> had a legal right to grant the lands now in dispute, and that, that government and his ma∣jesty's good subjects, the grantees of and settlers on the said lands, acted upon honest and honorable principles, in granting, purchasing &amp; settling the same, and on the other hand it appears, that the government of <HI>New-York</HI> in re-granting the same land, acted quite the reverse; and the more unpardonably so, as they granted great part of it in open defiance to his ma∣jesty's authority manifested unto them by his ex∣press prohibition, dated the 24th day of <HI>July</HI> 1767.</P>
<P>FROM what has been already elucidated it appears, that the administration of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had adjudg∣ed in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the govern∣ment of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> extended westward of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI>-river,
<PB N="100" REF="016183_0100_0F9BCC5A427DB9D0"/>and that this was the general sense of the nation (till ascertained as aforesaid) is real mat∣ter of fact.—True no determination of his majesty or reports of the lords of trade had before particu∣larized how far the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> should extend west of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river: but such determinations of their's mightily strengthened the common opinion, nay, fully confirmed it, that that government extended westward to a twenty miles distance east from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river. This was the o∣pinion both of king and subjects at the time the go∣vernment of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> granted those lands; and adventurers could not conceive of any interme∣diate boundary in one place more than another, be∣tween <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river and the twenty mile limit a∣foresaid; nor had they any apprehension that the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> would extend to the westward of that limit. This twenty mile line took universal and deep impression on the minds of geo∣graphers, and was the understanding of the <HI>British</HI> empire, and was thus portrayed in all former maps. The certainty of this general opinion may be fur∣ther illustrated from the consideration that none of the <HI>British</HI> subjects applied to the government of <HI>New-York</HI> for grants of those lands, till after the alteration of jurisdiction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <HI>New-York</HI> scriblers, that their government extended patents from within the said twenty mile line across the same, and on some part of the premis∣es in dispute, many years before the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> granted those lands—which will be hereafter considered: But, would further add, it is matter of dispute whether the administration at home
<PB N="101" REF="016183_0101_0F9BCC4509C3E890"/>would recognize those patents granted by the go∣vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the premises aforesaid; though antecedent to those granted by <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> inasmuch as the royal adjudication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the government of <HI>York York</HI> to grant them lands, which by royal ad∣judication of the line of jurisdiction between <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> fell within the go∣vernment of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in 1739, as aforesaid. However, for argument only, we will suppose the governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New York</HI> had each of them equal authority to grant those lands—then on this stating the case, prior granting would of consequence be priority of title. The first con∣veyance, upon this hypothesis, being good and va∣lid both in law and equity, must necessarily defeat any subsequent grant from the crown or its represen∣tatives, being as authentic, to all intents and pur∣poses, as any conveyance of the fee of land from the crown can possibly be.—Thus it appears upon this most favorable concession to those on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the argument preponderates in favor of the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> as their grants are prior to those of <HI>New-York,</HI> (except in the instances of the old parents, yet to be consider∣ed.)</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the express words of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, that the grantees were not only entitled to the fee of the lands therein dis∣cribed, but also to all the enfranchisements, and each and every of the privileges and immunities that by law his majesty's subjects in the province of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> enjoy; so that at the same time the gran∣tees
<PB N="102" REF="016183_0102_0F9BCC451AA384E0"/>were vested with the fee of the land, they were enfranchised with, and entitled to all the privileges and immunities contained in their charters; as the holding of fairs, choosing town officers, and making and mending their own roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it should be the future pleasure of his majesty, to continue the said lands in the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> (which by the settlers aforesaid is hoped will not be the case) that the claimants and settlers under the said grants, will nevertheless have his majesty's gracious appro∣bation to enjoy without let or molestation, the pri∣vileges of incorporation therein contained; the gran∣tees having ever considered those privileges as inse∣perably connected with the grant of the fee-simple.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the facts and reasons that have been ad∣vanced in the foregoing sections, it manifestly appears, that the title of the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> to the lands in question is indefeasible; yet still there are sundry considerations that may serve more abundantly to confirm and establish this title beyond hesitation. As,</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, The far greast part of the extent of jurisdiction of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and great part of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> depended entirely on his majesty's pleasure, being wholly in the arbitration of the crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real grant on which the original circumference of the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> founded, ex∣tended but sixty miles from the sea into the country,
<PB N="103" REF="016183_0103_0F9BCC45DACED6B8"/>to the westward, terminating about twenty miles cast of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river. This government was af∣terwards enlarged by his majesty's commission to <HI>Benning Wentworth,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> governor of that province, directing it to extend to the westward until it should meet with his majesty's other governments. Which clause of western extention in the said commission, as well as the royal adjudication of the boundary line between this government and the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in 1739, and report of the lords of trade in 1755, and many other arguments mentioned in this and the foregoing sections, all on the part of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> amount to sufficient evidence, that their go∣vernment extended so far west as twenty miles east of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er. And with respect to the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> its original northen circumference ter∣minated south of the city of <HI>Albany,</HI> and afterwards, as plantations are extended northerly, either on pa∣tents procured immediately from the crown or go∣vernment, or meer settlements on extra-provincial lands, commissions from the king, to the respective governors were enlarged, as in the example follow∣ing, viz. A. M. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> captain general, governor and commander in chief in and over the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> (then follows the enlargement,) and the terri∣tories depending thereon in <HI>America.</HI>—These terri∣tories are that extension of jurisdiction beyond their first circumscribed limits, terminating south of <HI>Alba∣ny,</HI> called the province. This territorial extension of jurisdiction is altogether in the arbitration of the crown to curtail or extend as before represented. This being the case, the respective governors can no other way be judges of the extent of their jurisdicti∣on,
<PB N="104" REF="016183_0104_0F9BCC469973B388"/>but by directions given them in their commis∣sions, together with his majesty's express proclama∣tions, and public determinations relative thereto, as in the instance of the royal adjudication in 1764; a publication of which, by his majesty's order, gave his subjects to understand, that it was his pleasure that the territorial jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> should extend to the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, which includes the disputed premises within that govern∣ment; before this it was impossible for the subjects to know it; if they could have understood it with∣out his majesty's proclamation certifying the same, such proclamation would have been needless and impertinent. The truth of the matter is, his majesty in 1739, determined <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> government should cover the present disputed premises; he alter∣ed his determination in 1764, whereby <HI>New-York</HI> extended its territories over the same land. And the king has an undoubted right to alter and regulate the jurisdiction of royal governments as may seem to him mete, so long as his royal power exists; and for the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> to amuse people of common sense, pretending that it is the ancient and indispu∣table right of the colony of <HI>New-York</HI> to extend to the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, as its eastern boundary, is the very height of folly. It was in the nature of things absolutely impossible his ma∣jesty himself should have known that to have been the case the moment before he determined it, and equally inconsistent that the subjects should know it before his majesty proclaimed it.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the representation which was laid before his majesty by Lieutenant go∣vernor
<PB N="105" REF="016183_0105_0F9BCC47638886F0"/><HI>Colden,</HI> as an inducement to prefix the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, the eastern boundary of the province of <HI>New-York</HI>—That they were argu∣ments of conveniency, holding up to view that it would be greatly to the advantage of the inhabitants on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, to be under the juris∣diction of <HI>New-York;</HI> which arguments are incom∣patible with the idea of antecedent right of jurisdic∣tion. Likewise, from hence we may see the incon∣sistency of that government or its patentees, in founding their right in fee to the lands in contest, by virtue of the said royal adjudication of the boundary line on the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river; inas∣much as it cannot operate to their advantage ante∣cedent to the date of that adjudication, and after∣ward cannot be considered any thing more than a mere line of jurisdiction between the respective go∣vernments.</P>
<P>IT should be furthermore considered, that neither governments were vested with the fee of those lands; their case in this respect, is quite the reverse of that of proprietary governments, who have a right to appropriate the soil. In royal governments, it is true, the governors have a delegated authority from his majesty to grant crown lands; and in such go∣vernments it is a prerogative of the crown to alter the limits of jurisdiction; his majesty hath a right to re-annex the disputed premises to his province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> (in which it formerly was, and on the faith of which the claimants under that govern∣ment purchased and settled the same lands) or in∣corporate it into a new government, or continue it under the present jurisdiction, as his royal wisdom
<PB N="106" REF="016183_0106_0F9BCC48107F2CD0"/>may discern to be best for the governed: But, upon such alterations of jurisdiction, private pro∣perty is never changed or subverted. For, if the property of the subject be in the arbitration of the crown, and liable to the same vicissitudes and chan∣ges with jurisdiction, this would destroy the very nature of property, and would render a king abso∣lute, and despotic, which is perfectly inconsistent with the constitution of the kingdom.—Therefore, to convey or alienate property, is the sacred prero∣gative of the rightful OWNER.—Kings and gover∣nors (in the kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>) cannot in∣termeddle therewith. There is indeed as much dif∣ference betwen the change of jurisdiction, and trans∣fering of the property of the subject, as there is be∣tween light and darkness, although since the said royal adjudication in 1764, the <HI>New-Yorkers,</HI> have endeavored to blend them together to answer sinister and lucrative purposes.—They were sensible, un∣doubtedly, that such the aforesaid arguments were conclusive against their monopolizing the fee-simple of said lands; and as it is very common for people, who are upon a design of engrossing the property of their neighbour, to set up some specious pretence of right, to vindicate themselves from the imputation of dishonor and reproach; so in the present case, the <HI>New Yorkers</HI> endeavored to draw the curtain of the duke of <HI>York</HI> over their knavery, and under the feigned character of heirs, to that apostate duke, claim the lands aforesaid, and fancy themselves the owners of towns, (fields) and houses that they build∣ed not.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH the arguments contained in the fore∣going sections are full and conclusive, relative to the nullity and nothingness of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant, at least, such part thereof as concerns the present dispute; and that neither the government of <HI>New-York</HI> or its patentees gain any manner of title to the land in contest, by predicating it on the validity of that grant, yet the general assembly of the said pro∣vince in their state of the rights, &amp;c. venture the stress of their whole cause thereon, and deduce all their arguments of title to those disputed Premises therefrom: It is therefore partly out of compliment to them, as well as more fully to invlidate, and ap∣parently demonstrate, to every capable judge, the utter insufficiency and desect of title to those lands, by conveyance from the government of <HI>NewYork,</HI> that the grant of the duke of <HI>York</HI> is here brought under consideration: and in order thereto, it is ne∣cessary that the second grant be here inserted, which is transcribed from the <HI>New-York</HI> pamphlet Verba∣tim.</P>

<P>It appears from the sequel of the representations, narratives and arguments contained in the <HI>New-York</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="016183_0109_0F9BCC4A500DE4D0"/>pamphlet, that the government of <HI>New-York</HI> do not pretend to any conveyance of the fee of the lands in contest from the duke of <HI>York.</HI> But their grand hypothesis is, that the jurisdiction of their go∣vernment from the first establishment, was predica∣ted on, and bounded by the descriptive limits of the said grant; and consequently, that the disputed Pre∣mises was never in the government of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire;</HI> and, that that government never was vested with authority to grant those lands, and also conse∣quently, that the grants by them made, are in their own nature void. This is the sum of the <HI>New-York</HI> arguments relative to their title to those lands. Here</P>
<P>FIRST, it is necessary the descriptive Limits of the above rehearsed Charter be brought under Consider∣ation; which includes the countries of <HI>St. Croix,</HI> adjoining <HI>New-Scotland, Pemaquid,</HI> the river <HI>Kene∣beque,</HI> and the islands known by the names of <HI>Mar∣tin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</HI> &amp;c. All these countries lying east of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and within the actual jurisdiction of the provinces of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay, New-Hampshire,</HI> &amp;c. and at present not contended for on the Part of <HI>New-York.</HI> Their general assem∣bly, in the "state of the right." &amp;c. had done well to have informed the public, whether their "anci∣ent and indisputable right" of jurisdiction extended to every part of the descriptive limits of the grants aforesaid, and if not, to which part it was circum∣scribed; and when done, and by what authority; whether their governors commissions, at any time, particularized and determined to what part of the limits of the said duke's grant their jurisdiction should extend, more than another, or to the whole;
<PB N="110" REF="016183_0110_0F9BCC4B10567AD8"/>or, whether any royal edict or proclamation, had ever thus given them such predicated limits of juris∣diction: this is absolutely necessary for them to do, in support of their title to the lands in question. And furthermore, it is requisite for them to demon∣strate that those lands were actually contained in such their former limits of jurisdiction: but, if the government of <HI>New-York</HI> from royal determination, cannot extend jurisdiction to any
one part of the descriptive limits of the grant aforesaid, more than to another; then, on this hypothesis, their jurisdicti∣on includes the whole limits contained in the grant, or none at all; that it includes the whole, will not be pretended, and that any party, as predicated on them limits, cannot be made to appear: but on the contrary, it appears his majesty and council had no reference to any part of the limits of this grant, in determining the boundaries of the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York</HI> in 1764, as may appear from the royal order itself, an extract of which is as follows: <Q>His majesty with the advice of his privy council, doth order and declare, That the west banks of the ri∣ver <HI>Connecticut,</HI> from whence it enters the pro∣vince of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> as far north as the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary between the said two provinces</Q>—that parrallel of latitude is also established it's north boun∣dary. The source of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river is supposed to be something to the northward of latitude forty-five, and comes much from the north-east, a consi∣derable distance after it passes that latitude; but it is notorious, that the source of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river is far south of it; so that by comparing the descriptive li∣mits
<PB N="111" REF="016183_0111_0F9BCC4BCF535AE8"/>of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant, with those express∣ed in the royal order, they will be found to be ma∣terially different. The limit of that part of the duke's grant which respects the present arguments, is in the words following: <Q>Together also with the said river called <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, and all the lands from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay;</Q> which limit in any possi∣ble construction of it, can include but part of the disputed premises, (which said premises extend and are bounded on the forty-fifth degree of north lati∣tude,) as will more fully appear in a further discus∣sion of that line. But,</P>
<P>FIRST, it is manifest that the king and privy council, in determining the extent of the jurisdiction of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> did not proceed upon the idea of that government's having any antecedent right of jurisdiction to those lands. Had that been the case, the royal order had been predicated on the boundary lines of the duke's grant afaresaid, and could not have comprehended any more land than <Q>from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay;</Q> and these bounds are so loose, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impossible to found a line of jurisdiction thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following ob∣servations on the descriptive limits thereof, which may be seen at large in the fore part of this section. Therefore, such part only as is necessary for the con∣sideration of the indeterminate bounds before spoken of, is here quoted; which, after describing the situ∣ation of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and that it abuts upon the main land <Q>between the two rivers there called or
<PB N="112" REF="016183_0112_0F9BCC4C96605908"/>known by the several names of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river,</Q> begins the description under con∣sideration, <Q>together with the said river called <HI>Hud∣son</HI>'s river.</Q> Observe, that as the description of this river is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following discriptions in said grant; nothing more can possibly be included in it, but a discription of the river only, exclusive of one foot of land on either side. The second discription <Q>and all the land from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay.</Q> The best ma∣thematition on earth cannot ascertain these limits, except upon arbitrary principles, as there can be no prefixed place on <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river where to erect the first bounds; and as to any particular place on the "east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay," where to erect a se∣cond, is altogether undetermined in this discription: But, inasmuch as it includes all the land from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, &amp;c. there is a little better foundation to establish the first bounds than the second. It seems in order to include all as afore∣said, it would be necessary to extend either to the head of the river, or to the most northerly extention of the whole stream, to make the first bounds; and provided this imaginary bounds should extend north of the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, it would so far exceed the settlement of the line in 1764. Be this as it will, the most northerly part of the river, which would most likely be the head, would be the most favourable on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> for to esta∣blish a first bounds, and from thence to extend a straight line to some place on the east side of <HI>Dela∣ware</HI>-bay; this is something of a natural constructi∣on,
<PB N="113" REF="016183_0113_0F9BCC4D596DA8A8"/>on the indeterminate descriptive limits aforesaid, without exploring <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, which in this case is necessary. And, first, in tracing said river to its source, it is found towards it's extremity, to come much out of the north-east. This being the case, a straight line from its head to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay, would cross said river and include a large tract of land on the east side, and perhaps cross the river sundry times; the consequences may be drawn thus, that where the line may be supposed to cross the last time ought to be the first real north boundary, of the "ancient and indisputable" limit of jurisdiction of <HI>New-York.</HI> For, if the bounds at the head of the river before spoken of, be so established, it would include considerable land on the east side of the ri∣ver, within the old boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> which is contrary to any idea to be gained from the discrip∣tive limit aforesaid, viz. <Q>and all the land from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, &amp;c.</Q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another pro∣posed first boundary better purporting with the de∣scription of <Q>and all the land from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay,</Q> between the head of the river, and the place where the imaginary line was supposed to pass? To this it may be answered, that a place between these two, so far up the river as in tracing a straight line from thence, to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay, would not cross the river, may better agree with the above description: Still, from none of these imagined lines, from the differ∣ent imagined bounds, or from any other projected, possible, first bounds, can such a straight line be as∣certained, till the place for the south-western boun∣dary
<PB N="114" REF="016183_0114_0F9BCC4E109BA1F8"/>on the "east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay" be establish∣ed? And the vagueness of the descriptive limit is so great, that it cannot be determined whether that bounds shall be at the northern extremity of the east side of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay, or at the southern, where it communicates with the main ocean, or at any other intermediate place between these two: so, that from the uncertainty of the second bounds, it is impossi∣ble to establish the first, so as exactly to include "all the land from the west side of the said river to the east side of said bay," and no more. And,</P>
<P>THUS it is demonstrated from the vagueness, un∣certainty and obsoleteness of the discriptive limits of the grant to the duke of <HI>York,</HI> before quoted at large; that it is in the nature of things absolutely impossible to ascertain it. From hence follows a second necessary inference, viz. That it is equally impossible and contradictory, that governmental ju∣risdiction should be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain jurisdiction, in its own nature incapable to be determined, is in reali∣ty none at all. And from hence follows a third inference which deter∣mines the sequel of the argument on the subject of property, concerning the lands in question, to be in favour of the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire:</HI> For, it is in the last place equally contradictory and im∣possible, as in the case of the absurdity of ascertain∣ing the limits of the pretended "ancient" jurisdic∣tion of <HI>New-York,</HI> predicating it on vague and un∣determinate boundaries, that, that government should predicate their right to the fee of lands, by them thus unascertainable; for as uncertainty and natural im∣possibility of a jurisdiction's being rendered determi∣nate
<PB N="115" REF="016183_0115_0F9BCC505B0DA8C0"/>makes it in reality to be none at all; so the idea of property, predicated thereon is equally imperti∣nent. True it is, by the royal determination in 1764, the east line of <HI>New-York</HI> extended to the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river. Which may be foundation for conjecture, that that limit might have reference to a description in the duke's grant aforesaid, "and all the lands from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river," &amp;c. Yet when the representation made by lieut. governor <HI>Colden,</HI> to his majesty in council, as men∣tioned in this pamphlet, under the head of the nar∣rative, &amp;c. comes to be considered, it will reflect light on this point. The arguments made use of in the said representation were those of conveniency and advantage to the settlers on those lands to be in the government of <HI>New-York:</HI> and, that the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river was a good and certain boundary," &amp;c. These were undoubtedly the pre∣ponderating motives of determining the west banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to be the east boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> and such arguments are utterly inconsistant with the notion of an "ancient indisputable right" of jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THERE is still another consideration which may be of moment in the observation of this, so trumpt up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to the lands in contest: If it be admitted a line should be drawn from the most northerly part of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the most north∣ern extremity of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay; still, it is by no means probable such line would include more than one half (if so much) of the lands in dispute so far as may be judged from the latitude and longitude of
<PB N="116" REF="016183_0116_0F9BCC511165B470"/>the respective objects: for considering the course of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, which is nearly from north to south, except towards its extremity; and the sea coast, from the river's mouth, together with <HI>Dela∣ware</HI>-bay, forming also an indened line, to the south of west; the land included in these limits, by a line drawn from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay as a∣foresaid, would (excepting the small promontory formed by the mouth of the bay and the ocean) lye in the figure of an obtuse angled triangle; and the course of the said line from the river to the bay, ac∣cording to occular survey, would be from the north∣east a southwesterly direction: which very badly comports with the present north and westerly exer∣cise of jurisdiction of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> at <HI>Crown-Point, Detroit,</HI> &amp;c.—It may here well be observed, the settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> seem to be in a critical situation; every arbitrary measure under the present administration of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> is excercised against them; and provided they flee to the eastward to procure inheritances, there they are fore-closed, the descriptive limits of the said ancient jurisdiction covers them, (to wit) the coun∣tries of <HI>St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard,</HI> &amp;c.—Yet there is another large un∣known country to the west and northwest, which has been but partly explored; and provided these people, instead of fleeing, to the eastward, should turn their course to those countries; there, it is in∣disputable but that <HI>New-York</HI> would encircle them with another odd description of domain contained in their governor's commissions, i. e. <Q><HI>A. B.</HI> captain general governor and commander in chief in and
<PB N="117" REF="016183_0117_0F9BCC51ECE56880"/>over the province of <HI>New-York,</HI></Q> next follows the description hinted <Q>and the territories depending thereon, in <HI>America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM the foregoing descriptions of the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York,</HI> it appears they lay claim to so extensive a domain three different ways, or have three different modes or modifications in comprehending and engrossing their progressive limits. As,</P>
<P N="1">1stly. THE Province of <HI>New-York</HI> which falls short of and terminates considerably south of the city of <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. "THE territories depending thereon in <HI>America.</HI>" These territories comprehending such plantations, on extra-provincial land, as are and have been carried on adjoining to the province till its territories, are at present extended to <HI>Detroit,</HI> and the neighbourhood thereof, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The limits of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant, and inasmuch as the grantees and settlers on the lands in dispute, hold their title under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and that government had for several years exercised their jurisdiction over those lands, even till 1764.—Therefore in this case the government of <HI>New-York</HI> could not extend their territorial sort of jurisdiction over the premises; for such sort of jurisdiction might be challenged on the part of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> (if it should be admited at that time said premises were extra-provincial lands) and that with far the most propriety. Inasmuch as that government had grant∣ed the land and began settlements thereon. Add to this the following clause in governor <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s commission, which they viewed to be of great weight in this case, which, after describing the former li∣mits
<PB N="118" REF="016183_0118_0F9BCC528FB8E700"/>of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> <Q>and from thence extend∣ing west till it meets with his majesty's other go∣vernments.</Q> Add to this also, the reasons held forth in the chain of arguments, contained in the three first sections; all which were too potent for the <HI>New-York</HI> territorial sort of dominion to frus∣trate. At that juncture, therefore, the lawyers, land-jobbers, politicians, &amp;c. planed out the afore∣said three modes of jurisdiction predicating it on the descriptive limits of the grant to the duke of <HI>York.</HI> And on this new modled plan breathed an air of "ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT OF" jurisdic∣tion, and consequently to the fee of the lands in contest.</P>
<P>THE first intimation that ever saluted the ears of the publick, asserting it to be the ancient right of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> to extend to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river as its eastern boundary, was discoverd from a pro∣clamation given under the hand of <HI>William Tryon,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> governor of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> &amp;c. and dated the 11th day of <HI>December,</HI> 1771. His proclamation begins after the following manner: <Q>Whereas it is the ancient and incontestble right of this colony to extend to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, as its eastern boundary.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was drawing a positive conclusion from fictitious, and till that time, unheard of premises; and rather influenced people in the several govern∣ments, to purchase and settle under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> than diswade therefrom; for common fame and com∣mon sense, were a barrier against the belief of this <HI>New-York</HI> doctrine, which from the time of the roy∣al adjudication in 1764, was by the proclamation
<PB N="119" REF="016183_0119_0F9BCC535157BA50"/>aforesaid, antidated to "ancient." That this doc∣trine till then, was incontested, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public consideration, and has ever since been contested.</P>
<P>SHOULD this their new hypothesis be admitted; yet, as hath been before observed, these limits could include but part of said lands, according to the best judgment that can be formed without an actual and accurate survey of the descriptive limits of said grant; which if the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can do and fairly demonstrate, to any able mathematicians, and com∣petant and impartial judges, that they have rightly ascertained those limits, it is engaged on the part of the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> that they shall yield up to the land-jobbers of <HI>New-York,</HI> their lands and labours: an object which undoubtedly would be grateful and pleasing to them; and which they have many years been in pursuit of, and have hi∣therto had the mortification to be baffled. It is ve∣rily incumbant on the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> in order to found title to those land on this new scheme.</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, to ascertain the limits of their imagina∣ry bounds. This the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> will expect compleated, or hear no more of those "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" boundaries of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>

<P>THE general assembly of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> in their state of the right of that colony, &amp;c. page 3d, wave the right of the <HI>English</HI> by first discovery,
<PB N="120" REF="016183_0120_0F9BCC54131423D8"/>as being foreign to their purpose, and that the <HI>Dutch</HI> possessions are only material to be supported; and claim no further right by way of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but priority of possession. Yet in the same page in∣form, <Q>when the first war between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land</HI> became inevitable, king <HI>Charles</HI> the second, by letters patent dated the 12th day of <HI>March</HI> 1663-4, granted to his brother the duke of <HI>York</HI> the tracts of country, which comprehend <HI>New-York.</HI> To render this gift effectual, before the war was proclaimed, a fleet and land forces were sent out to remove the <HI>Dutch</HI> and put the duke in possession.</Q>—The circumstancies that attended the making this grant, and sending the armament to ren∣der it effectual, is a sufficient reason to determine that the government at home, at that time, viewed the <HI>Dutch</HI> settlement as an intrusion, and possession (which is all they rely on) gained by trespass, in le∣gal construction, is no possession at all. That the <HI>English</HI> had prior right to all the countries from for∣ty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude, by virtue not only of discovery by <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> and others, but by being in actual possession of several parts of the premises, is matters too well known to be dis∣puted.</P>
<P>WHETHER there was real seisin in the crown or not at the time of granting these countries, is not truly in question; since every grant so made is in∣contestibly valid against the king, his heirs and suc∣cessors; and the colony of <HI>New-York</HI> being entirely dependant on the crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for their title; priority of charter is therefore necessary to be determined.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="016183_0121_0F9BCC54D8A44DC8"/>
THE grant of king <HI>James</HI> the first to the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> bearing date at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the 13th day of <HI>November,</HI> in the eighteenth year or his reign, comprehends all the lands, islands, &amp;c. from forty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude, through the main land from sea to sea. "On the 19th day of <HI>March</HI> 1628, the council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> under their com∣mon seal, did grant to sir <HI>Henry Roswell,</HI> sir <HI>John Young,</HI> and others, their heirs and associates for ever, all that part of <HI>America,</HI> lying between the great river there, commonly called <HI>Monomack,</HI> alias <HI>Meri∣mack</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> river, within the space of three miles to the northward of the same river, called <HI>Mo∣nomack,</HI> alias <HI>Merimack,</HI> or to the northward of any or every part thereof, and in length and longitude of and within all the breadth aforesaid, throughout the main lands there, from the Atlantic or western sea or ocean on the east part, to the South sea on the west part."</P>
<P>THIS deed of sale at the suit of the grantees, with a charter of incorporation, was granted and confirm∣ed by king CHARLES the first, the 4th day of <HI>March</HI> 1629, wherein the limits are exact∣ly the same with those in the <HI>Plymouth</HI> conveyance; and the proviso of CHARLES, that the actual settlement of the sub∣jects of other christian states to determine the extent, the same as was the proviso in <HI>James</HI>'s grant to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> company.</P>
<P>THIS same charter of incorporation was adjudged void in the high court of chancery of <HI>England</HI> in 1684; from which the assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> in their state, &amp;c. page 5th, take occasion to say <Q>the title of that colony now solely depends on their
<PB N="122" REF="016183_0122_0F9BCC5593D9C1B0"/>new charter of 1691.</Q> Nevertheless, the right of soil to all and every part of the deed of sale afore∣said, remained indefeasible; for, only animadvert back to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> conveyance, and observe, that the right in fee, was by them conveyed to the gran∣tees; and trace it to king CHARLES'S charter of in∣corporation, which only vested the grantees with powers of government. Though it is true, this charter contains all the formality necessary in the conveyance of the fee; yet is, so far as respects the fee, no more than a duplicate of what was before granted, which neither adds nor deminisheth; and it is easy to see, that the court of chancery could not vacate or make void, at most, any thing more than those incorporate privileges; and likewise as easily discernable that nothing more was attempted. Thus the colony of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> still hold their right in fee, by conveyance from king JAMES to the coun∣cil of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who were their grantors.</P>
<P>IN the next place it may be observed, that in 1691 the privileges of incorporation were restored; tho' our authors, in their state &amp;c. endeavor to curtail the colony of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> by construing their last charter to extend no further west than the east limit of the colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> Their words are these, "these words <HI>(as far as)</HI> being in the case of the grant of the crown on the suit of the party, in legal construction, carry the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay colo∣ny no farther westward than till it meets the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and much less to the westward of it." Be these bold assertions as they will, and provided it be here admitted, for argument sake, that the powers of jurisdiction of the
<PB N="123" REF="016183_0123_0F9BCC5650C7BB08"/>province of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay be ever so much curtailed, yet one proposition we can verily be as∣sured of viz. That it is not in the power of king or chancery to curtail or deprive them of their pro∣perty.</P>
<P>IT is to be further observed, that however our authors may criticise upon the gramatical or legal construction of selected words or phrases; yet, a lit∣tle attention to the following real facts, will clearly point out the inconsistency of such sophisms.</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, <HI>Connecticut</HI> charter, granted by king CHARLES the second, the 23d day of <HI>April</HI> 1662, was bounded and extended in length, by and with the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> first charter, granted by king CHARLES the first, the 4th day of <HI>March</HI> 1629, which incontestibly extended agreeable with the a∣foresaid discriptive limits of the deed of sale from the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to sir <HI>Henry Roswell,</HI> sir <HI>John Young,</HI> &amp;c. and extended through the main land in longitude to the south sea on the west part.</P>
<P>THIS charter, as above, being nullified in the high court of chancery of <HI>England</HI> in 1684, and re∣stored again in 1691, wherein the west extent of li∣mit is predicated by that of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and this west limit of <HI>Connecticut</HI> being predicated by the old charter of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay, and expresly ex∣tending in longitude to the South sea on the west part, exactly extends the present charter of the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts</HI>-bay, with its powers of jurisdiction to all, and every part of the limits of the old nulled char∣ter. This is the natural and legal sense of the pre∣sent charter of the colony of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay, predicated on undeniable facts.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="016183_0124_0F9BCC57120B7DD8"/>
IN the next place 'tis necessary to consider the charter of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which our authors inform should not extend west of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, in the words following: <Q>This being a crown grant on the suit and petition of the grantees, is to be ta∣ken most beneficially for the king. The descrip∣tive words, and the intention of the grant, will in legal construction be satisfied by giving the colony the same length as the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay; and it is plain both from the recital and the saving clause in the <HI>Plymouth</HI> patent, on which the <HI>Mas∣sachusett</HI>'s title was founded, that the latter cou'd not in any sense, extend to the westward of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI>-river.</Q> As this their assertion is founded on the hipothesis of <HI>Connecticut</HI> charter's being pre∣dicated on that of the <HI>Massachusett</HI>'s, and therefore the arguments before exhibited on that head, are e∣qually conclusive for the establishing the western ex∣tent of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> nothing more is necessary for that purpose, but a recital of the discriptive words of their charter, granted subsequent to their purchase from the council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> by king CHARLES the second, the 23d day of <HI>April,</HI> 1662, <Q>bounded on the east by <HI>Narraganset</HI>-river, commonly called <HI>Narraganset</HI>-bay, where the said river falleth into the sea; and on the north by the line of the <HI>Massa∣chusetts</HI> plantation; and on the sea, and in longi∣tude as the line of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> colony, run∣ning from east to west: that is to say, from the said <HI>Narraganset</HI>-bay on the east, to the South sea on the west part.</Q> Thus it appears and only by the demonstrations aforesaid, but from the express words of the descriptive limits of the charter itself,
<PB N="125" REF="016183_0125_0F9BCC57D53415D8"/>which cannot admit of a double meaning, (curious as our authors be in the art of playing with words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal mean∣ing,) that it is the unquestionable right of the colo∣ny of <HI>Connecticut</HI> to extend its western boundary to the South sea on the "west part;" and in this that colony agree, who are now challenging their right in fee to those limits, and actually making plantati∣on, as at <HI>Susquebannah,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BY this time, undoubtedly queries will arise in the mind of the reader, what will become of the grant to the duke of <HI>York,</HI> if the <HI>Massachusett's</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> colonies extend "to the South sea on the west part?" The following intelligence from our authors will intro∣duce an answer to this query; who, after describing said grant further inform, in page 3d of the state, &amp;c. That <Q>a fleet and land forces were sent to re∣move the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and put the duke in possession.</Q> Accordingly, on the 27th day of <HI>August</HI> 1664, the <HI>Dutch</HI> governor <HI>Stuyvesant,</HI> surrendered by capitula∣tion, all the countries the <HI>Dutch</HI> then possessed, to king CHARLES the second; when among other terms it was stipulated, <Q>that all the people shall remain free denizens, and shall enjoy their lands, houses, and goods, wheresoever they are within this country, and dispose of them as they please.</Q> Thus, by conquest, the king became revested with his right to the lands conquer∣ed: for, as the king had antecedently disposed of the estate the crown was possessed of in these countries, to the colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay; therefore, his right now could not extend any further than the actual conquest, which, in legal construction, must
<PB N="126" REF="016183_0126_0F9BCC5AD3708060"/>be satisfied with, and can extend no further than the actual possessions described in the forementioned capitulation. A further information is in page 4th, <Q>To remove any doubt of the validity of the dukes title, either from the want of seisin in the crown when it originated, or on account of the interme∣diate conquest by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it was confirmed to his royal highness by further letters patent, dated the 29th day of <HI>June,</HI> 1674.</Q> That there was want of seisin in the crown at the time of first grant∣ing, is incontestible; for, as above said, the king by antecedent grants had divested the crown of its right, and by this conquest became revested: So that from this, occasion will be taken to say, that in fact the province of <HI>New-York</HI> was originally sounded on conquest, and the limits of it, as before mentioned, circumscribed by the <HI>Dutch</HI> possessions pointed out in the terms of capitulation. Howe∣ver unfavorable this conclusion may be thought on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> yet, as the crown had prior to either of the duke's grants, disposed of its right to the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> colonies—if it was not thus founded on conquest, it hath no foun∣dation at all; and its having any place for existence, is but an "intrusion on the rights" of those other colonies. Furthermore, it is mysterious and con∣tradictory, admitting that that government was thus founded, to suppose the duke could be lord pro∣prietor; inasmuch as by the conditions of capitula∣tion, the fee then acquired to the crown, passed to the <HI>Dutch</HI> inhabitants, who then became <HI>English</HI> subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="016183_0127_0F9BCC5BB5740178"/>
THOUGH this tract of land now in contest, was contained in the original grant to the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> yet as they never made any conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the crown on the surren∣der of that grant, the 7th day of <HI>June,</HI> 1635. From which it may be objected, on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the above conciseness in the circumscription of the boundaries of their colony is too great; for, that the grant to the duke must hold good where the crown, at the time of granting, was vested with a right to the lands granted. In answer, it has been argued in the preceeding section, that it is very un∣certain whether the limits of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant included this tract of land, or if any, how great a part; and that the limits of said grant cou'd not be ascertained—and that governmental jurisdiction, and property cou'd not be predicated on such ob∣solete and uncertain bounds. It was also demon∣strated in the first section, and will be further obser∣ved in this, that the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant reverted to the crown, and that the landholders in the go∣vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> hold under the crown, and that, if it did not revert to the crown, the fee is still in the duke, his heirs and assigns, and no land∣holders in the government are vested with the fee of the lands they possess, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This argument and conclusion is founded on the <HI>New-York</HI> hypothesis, exclusive of the herein mentioned article in the Dutch capitulation.</NOTE> It would be too tedi∣ous as well as needless to recite the arguments that have been offered in the three first sections, which is humbly conceived are abundantly suf∣ficient to answer the aforesaid objection, and fairly
<PB N="128" REF="016183_0128_0F9BCC5C53229328"/>demonstrate priority of title to be in favor of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> to which the curteous reader is referred for a consideration.</P>
<P>As has been before observed, the design of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant was to include the <HI>Dutch</HI> pos∣sessions; or in other words, that it never was valid any further than to such possession, which by con∣quest, reverted to the crown, and no farther than these limits, to interfere with the charrer colonies of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> And as a twenty miles line to the eastward from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river would include the most eastern extent of the afore-menti∣oned possessions, the reason why such a line was a∣greed to as the boundary between the colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-York:</HI> But, as these possessions to the northward of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> fell far short of this twenty mile line, or were so inconsiderable and un∣certain as not to come within the capitulation re∣serve; therefore the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> colony contended with <HI>New-York</HI> for a further western extent than twenty miles east from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river; but the rest∣less government of <HI>New-York,</HI> ever uneasy within its own boundaries, presumed unrelenting, to intrude on, and contesting for the just rights of the <HI>Massa∣chusetts,</HI> by extending their patents far to the east∣ward of twenty miles from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river; in conse∣quence of which the greatest disturbances have ari∣sen between the inhabitants of the respective colo∣nies, and sundry of the conflicts so severe, that hu∣man blood spilt in the contest redened the hands of the intruders; but finally a boundary line was a∣greed to by the respective governments in 1773, at a twenty miles distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, which has since been ratified by his majesty.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="016183_0129_0F9BCC5D1188F7C8"/>
IN the state of the right, &amp;c. page 4th, is the most extraordinary account of alienation of property that is to be found in the annals of history. <Q>The duke continued proprietor and chief governor of this province till he ascended the throne, when his right merged in the royal authority, on his abdi∣cation it passed to king <HI>William,</HI> his successor, as lord proprietor and royal sovereign.</Q> That up∣on the duke's accession to the throne his right of government merged in the royal authority will not be denied; but, that his right in fee consequently passed to king <HI>William</HI> as his successor, wants great∣er proof than a bare assertion; our authors should have explained this matter; 'tis taken for granted they will not pretend that king <HI>William</HI> was heir at law to the duke's estate, and they mention no con∣veyance from the duke to the king, but say the "duke's right merged in the royal authority;" to suppose it is possible that right should pass to king <HI>William,</HI> as lord proprietor, is so great an absurdity that it wants a name.</P>
<P>In the same page they further inform, that <Q>in the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s commissions to his several lieu∣tenant governors Major <HI>Edmond Andross,</HI> on the first day of <HI>July</HI> 1674, and Colonel <HI>Thomas Dongan</HI> on the 30th day of <HI>September</HI> 1682, among other description of the boundaries of this province are expressly comprehended all the land from the west side of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the east side of <HI>Dela∣ware</HI>-bay.</Q> Note, those commissions were nom the duke before he ascended the throne; undoubt∣edly in his commissions to his lieutenant Governors, he had reference to the limits of his grant, to deter∣mine
<PB N="130" REF="016183_0130_0F9BCC5DD179B1A0"/>their boundaries: but after his abdication, and the accession of king <HI>William</HI> and queen <HI>Mary,</HI> we find a commission from their majesty's to <HI>Henry Slaughter,</HI> to be materially different. <Q>King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by their commission, dated the fourth day of <HI>January,</HI> in the first year of their reign, appointed <HI>Henry Slaughter,</HI> to be governor of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the territories depending thereon in <HI>America.</HI></Q> The same as∣sembly (stiled our authors) further inform, that <Q>in all subsequent acts and commissions this colony is described by the same words, the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the territories depending thereon in <HI>A∣merica.</HI></Q> No arguments need be used to prove, for it is self-evident, their majesty's had some differ∣ent idea of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> than what had been before described by the duke's commissi∣ons to his lieutenant governors, and a little attention to the original state of that government, will explain that difference. Our authors further inform, page 17th, <Q>The <HI>Ransselaer</HI> family are not indebted to the government of <HI>New-York</HI> for their estate, they continue to enjoy it by an act of justice and not of favor; it was originally a <HI>Dutch</HI> colony of it∣self, granted to their ancestors by the <HI>Dutch West-India</HI> company, who held it as a part of <HI>New-Ne∣therlands,</HI> under the states general. On the sur∣render in 1664, their rights were secured to them in common with the rest of the inhabitants, by the before-mentioned article of capitulation grant∣ed on the surrender of the country, by Col. <HI>Ni∣chols,</HI> the commander in chief under the crown, and lieut, governor under the duke: the faith of
<PB N="131" REF="016183_0131_0F9BCC5E945FF528"/>government was pledged for their security, and their estates were confirmed under the seal of this colony in the year 1685, not by meer act of the provincial governor and council, but by an ex∣press order of king <HI>James</HI> the second.</Q> They fur∣ther inform page 5th, <Q>so long ago as the year 1685, king <HI>James</HI> the second, by letters patent under that seal granted to the <HI>Ranssclaer</HI> family the ma∣nor <HI>Renselaerwyck,</HI> extended from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river both on the east and west sides twenty-four miles.</Q> This manor includes the city of <HI>Albany,</HI> and extends near twenty miles to the southward of it; south of which terminates the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> ex∣pressed in their governor's commissions, so that this manor is included in their second description of do∣main, viz. the territories depending thereon, and ex∣clusive of this clause in the commissions, antecedent to the fore-mentioned determination in 1764, the governors of <HI>New-York</HI> cou'd not exercise jurisdicti∣on even in the manor of <HI>Renselaerwyck,</HI> and moth less to the northward of it, as settlements which lay contiguous to those limits seemed necessarily to fall under the jurisdiction of that government. Thus their territorial sort of dominion hath been extended, without any prescription or limitation, agreeable to the observation of their celebrated judge <HI>Smith,</HI> who, speaking of that government, said <Q>it might well be accounted <HI>unlimitted.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT may be further offered in objection on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that allowing the foregoing arguments relative to the territories, and that <HI>Renselaerwyck</HI> was, before the aera of the aforesaid determination, in fact annexed to the government by the territorial
<PB N="132" REF="016183_0132_0F9BCC5F59E8ACD8"/>clause in the governor's commissions; yet, neverthe∣less the duke's grant must be valid to the northward of that manor, to all the lands it originally covered. This cannot operate in favor of <HI>New-York,</HI> for, in addition to what has been before argued to this pur∣pose, the reader is desired to observe, that king <HI>James</HI> the second, who was this same duke of <HI>York,</HI> abdi∣cated the throne in 1688, and his estate reverted to the crown of <HI>England,</HI> and this grant became vested in the crown, the same as though the duke or his grant had never had an existance.—Nor have any of their governor's commissions, from <HI>Henry Slaugh∣ter,</HI> the first governor appointed by king <HI>William</HI> and queen <HI>Mary,</HI> down to this present aera, ever been predicated on, or had the least reference to the limits of that grant.</P>

<P>THE government of <HI>New-York</HI> make the greatest outcry against her sister colonies, taxing them with intrusion, violence and encroachment; and at the same time, are flagrantly more guilty of the same avaricious, unjust, and hostile wickedness than all the rest of the <HI>English America.</HI> Their capricious land jobbers have a surprising faculty in carrying their points; at the same time they are encroaching upon their neighbours, provided they meet with op∣position, they will cry out in the most exagerating exclamations, violence, riot, treason, &amp;c. and at the same time, not hesitate to trample upon his majesty's authority, (the particulars of which may be seen in the proceeding narrative.) They are great advocates
<PB N="133" REF="016183_0133_0F9BCC600FFBEF28"/>for law, order, and <HI>good</HI> government; these are their <HI>borns of iron, and with them do they push the poor and needy, when they get them into their net. Their way is as the way of a serpent upon a rock,</HI> and it is diffi∣cult <HI>to trace their footsteps:</HI> They complain of the lawless, factious, and riotous conduct of the settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> yet know, that they them∣selves are the moving cause of all the disturbances they complain of. It is incredible to suppose a collecti∣on of farmers exposed to the perpetual fatigues and laborious toile of cultivating a wilderness country, should under a just administration of law, become "a confederacy of insurgents." Was it only that natural presumption being so much in favor of those inhabitants, it is humbly conceived, that all wise and unprejudiced persons will, at least suspend their judgments concerning them, till the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can clearly evince, that these people are in reality, without cause, tumultuous, disorderly, &amp;c. And, inasmuch as the facts of this controversy is so fully set forth in this treatise, the reader is thereto refer∣red for a clearer exhibition.</P>
<P>OUR authors' in order to maintain their claim to the lands in contest, and if possible, to include it within one of the descriptive limits of the grant to duke of <HI>York,</HI> tell us many strange things about the colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Massachusetts:</HI> that <HI>Connecticut</HI> "in legal construction" should not have extended to the westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river; and that their settlements west of that river were an in∣trusion on the right of the colony of <HI>New-York;</HI> yet, nevertheless for peace sake, and rather than contest with "a powerful neighbour," they settled with
<PB N="134" REF="016183_0134_0F9BCC60D3E955F8"/>that colony at twenty miles distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river.</P>
<P>THEY further inform, that <Q>the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> claim stands by no means in so respectable a light as that of <HI>Connecticut,</HI></Q> and in legal construction, should extend <Q>no further westward than till it meets the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Con∣necticut</HI>-river, and much less to the westward of it.</Q> Our authors being men of great learning and saga∣city, soon extended their ancient right of jurisdiction over such part of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> colony as lay to the westward from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and this their scheme in stopping the western extension of that colony where it meets <HI>Connecticut,</HI> may be reckoned as one among the greatest of their political atchieve∣ments. "And it is worthy a remark," that had the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> colony extended west to the South sea, it could not have met <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but must have extended parallel with it, in the same direc∣tion.</P>
<P>To give this pleasing scheme some kind of co∣lour, they argue the nullity of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> first charter, and introduce the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant as the oldest title, page 5th, <Q>the <HI>Massachtsetts</HI> char∣ter was vacated, and the title of that colony now solely depends on their charter of 1691.</Q></P>
<P>YET they allow, that that colony obtained the right of soil from the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that the charter of king <HI>Charles</HI> dated the 4th day of <HI>March</HI> 1628-9, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the charter spoken of as vacated, which was done as has been before largely treated of in 1684.</NOTE> vested them with powers of go∣vernment, (it's needless to animadvert on these
<PB N="135" REF="016183_0135_0F9BCC61916581A8"/>strange accounts) however, after they have charmed their imaginations with the fruitless idea of extend∣ing their ancient tight to all that part of the <HI>Bay</HI> province west of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, they complain bitterly of the encroachments of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> page 8th. <Q>Under circumstances so favorable to the rights of this colony, we have great reason to complain of the unwarrantable encroachments under the authority of the government of the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts</HI>-bay, by which a valuable tract extend∣ing from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, within twenty miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, has been wrested from us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEIR conduct seems the more inexcusable, as they must have known that such encroachments were not only disrespectful to his majesty's autho∣rity, and big with great mischiefs and disorders, but were highly injurious to private property, great part of these lands having anciently been granted to his majesty's subjects under the great seal of this colony.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to recite their old grants, which they tell us <Q>cover the country the whole breadth of the <HI>Massachusett</HI>'s claim:</Q> The manor of <HI>Ren∣selacrwyck,</HI> granted in 1685, and extending twenty-four miles each side from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river; and <HI>West∣onhook,</HI> in 1705, which extends about thirty miles from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river; and <HI>Hoosick,</HI> in 1685, which extends about thirty miles from the river. It seems to have been a political and universal principle with the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to begin their patents within the twenty mile line, and extend them east∣ward of it, that by this means they might have op∣portunity to encroach on, and jockey their neigh∣bouring
<PB N="136" REF="016183_0136_0F9BCC624FF12D40"/>colonies more or less, out of their lands, as subsequent policy, intriegue and power, would ren∣practicable.</P>
<P>THAT government, thus extended their patent into <HI>Connecticut,</HI> one in particular, into the township of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> and it has ever been their practice to wrangle till they find by experience, that neither by sophistry, law, or hostility, they can maintain their exorbitant claims, and then capitulate on as good terms as they can; and conclude with branding their competitors with dishonesty, encroachment and many hard names, and don't scruple to impeach their governmental authority, (as in the case just re∣cited of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay) with being disrespect∣ful to his majesty's authority, and guilty of great mischiefs and disorders; although the authority of their own government, by their unjust, avaricious encroachments on the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> even to <HI>Conuec∣ticut</HI>-river, laid the foundation of those disorders, and they might have added blood-shed; yet their assembly have the impudence to palm it all upon the authority of the <HI>Massachusetts.</HI></P>
<P>THE claimants under <HI>NewHampshire</HI> are so happy as to be almost exempted from any <HI>New-York</HI> claims, by patents from that government prior to their's; the aforesaid <HI>Hoosick</HI> and <HI>Wallumscock</HI> patents being the only ones of this nature, the former includes a∣bout one quarter of the township of <HI>Pownal,</HI> on which part were about four settlers, when it was granted by <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> This township is bounded soucherly by the north line of the <HI>Massa∣chusetts</HI>-bay, and extends west as far as the <HI>Connecti∣cut</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts</HI> colonies; the latter, i. e. <HI>Wal∣lumscock</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="016183_0137_0F9BCC646A2FED40"/>patent, was granted under the common seal of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> the 15th day of <HI>June</HI> 1739. This patent is said to interfere with the township of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and it is matter of dispute, whether in its first location, it included more than about thirty or forty acres within that town, tho' it seems the patent by its descriptive limits, extends further into the town, and the patentees produce a map corresponding with those limits. This monu∣ment is well known by the <HI>Bennington</HI> people, and is on the western edge of the town; and there has never been a discovery of any lines of the survey of that location to the eastward of this monument. The many circumstances of this nature, amount to almost a certainty, that the patentees never made any actual location further interfering with <HI>Bennington,</HI> than as aforesaid; notwithstanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one eighth part of the town; which lands are exceeding good in nature, and are settled wholly underthe <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> title, by industrious farmers, who form a wilderness state, have cultivated and brought the most of it under good improvements, with many valuable houses, barns and orchards; some of them annually mowing at least eighty tons of hay, and raise other produce of the country in proportion. Not the least improvements of posses∣sions were ever made in that town, except by these inhabitants; neither had they the least knowledge of a pretence of any <HI>New-York</HI> patents extending there till several years after they had settled the land. As has been before observed, there were about four settlers on that part of <HI>Hoosick</HI> patent, included in
<PB N="138" REF="016183_0138_0F9BCC64922C5030"/>the township of <HI>Pownal,</HI> when it was granted; and if the author has a right information, there has not been any more settlements made under the <HI>New-York</HI> title since, though there had sundry families settled on the premises included as aforesaid, under the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> title.</P>
<P>As the state and circumstances of such part of the townships aforesaid as are included in the old patents, are materially different in many respects, from the circumstances of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants in general; it will therefore be necessary that this matter have a particular consideration; and that none of the aforesaid arguments be considered in this case but what are truely applicable; and in this review of the case, it will be admitted, that the old <HI>Wal∣lumscock</HI> patent includes such part of <HI>Bennington</HI> as the plan the patentees exhibit doth contain.</P>
<P>IT is taken for granted that the royal determina∣tion of the boundary line in 1764 could not extend the government of <HI>New-York</HI> antecedent to the date of that order, which was a manifestation of royal power, and which was the sole cause of that extenti∣on; therefore, at the time the government of <HI>New-York</HI> granted the forementioned old patents, they could have no greater authority for so doing than what they were then in fact possessed of: It remains therefore to be considered, whether the patents from the government of <HI>New-York</HI> are valid or not, so far as they interfere with the townships of <HI>Benning∣ton</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And firstly, it has been proved that the province of <HI>New-York</HI> as described in their governor's commissions, doth not extend so far north as the city of <HI>Albany;</HI> therefore the northern
<PB N="139" REF="016183_0139_0F9BCC65504709B8"/>tracts of country which these patents of <HI>Hoosick</HI> and <HI>Wallumscock</HI> cover, must be considered as belonging to their second sort of domain, (to wit) the territo∣ries. It has also been shewn, that these territories are not circumscribed to any particular limity, but that they were originally meant to include some an∣cient grants that were independent of the province and adjoining settlements, on extra-provincial lands: probably that government may have authority to grant land to the west and north-west, where it is indisputably unappropriated, and where the claim of none other government could interfere: but it will be insisted upon, on the part of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> settlers, which are included in the aforesaid old patents, that the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had no right to extend any of their patents to the castward of a line equivalent to that which consticutes the bounds between <HI>New-York</HI> and the colony of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts.</HI> This limit was ever thought by the people in general of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> as well as those of the adjacent colonies, to be the eastern boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> until the aera of the late determination, which extended it to the river <HI>Connecticut:</HI> and labouring men that sup∣port the world of mankind, are obliged to form their judgments of the jurisdiction of governments by the common received opinions of mankind they are conversant with; and even admitting they make an erroneous judgment, yet, in the present case, as the lands were of but little value, exclusive of their toil and cultivation; and as the farmers in reality uphold the state, it is therefore not only incumbent on the laws, but on the policy of the state to defend them
<PB N="140" REF="016183_0140_0F9BCC661F567218"/>in cases of this nature—it must be admitted that where the limits of governments are clearly ascer∣tained and notoriously known, that a farmer tres∣passing in this manner on another's property, must bear the loss. But, provided a country of people be generally under a deception as to matters of ju∣risdiction, and purchase land and make great im∣provements, and all on a mistaken footing; men in such circumstances should be considered in the most favorable light. For, as not only individuals, but the country about them were in the same manner deceived, and therefore, at the time of purchasing and settlement, they were utterly destitute of the means of knowledge; yet, however, it is not con∣ceded to, that those farmers on whose account the present arguments are exhibitted, are under a de∣ception about this matter; for of all sorts of govern∣mental jurisdiction, the <HI>New-York</HI> territorial was the weakest, loosest and most vague; it was rather oc∣casional and political, than positive; and in its own nature almost or quite incapable of being extended faster than settlements were actually carried on, or at most the lands exposed to this territorial jurisdic∣tion, should not be patented faster than his majesty's subjects are disposed forthwith to settle. The ne∣cessity of granting so fast may be pleaded on account of order—the policy of government may demand it; otherwise an occasional jurisdiction would be al∣together unable to abilitate the government to make conveyance of the right in fee; although it is indis∣putable that such a jurisdiction in matters of meer government, is to all intents and purposes, equal to positive jurisdiction; but with respect to having a
<PB N="141" REF="016183_0141_0F9BCC66CECF2340"/>power to convey the fee of lands, is matter of doubt: But thus much with propriety may be inferred, that a title so weak and impotent should not claim su∣periority over the least conception of title whate∣ver; a meer possession is of itself abundantly suffi∣cient to maintain the right in the possessor, and on a judicious trial at common law, (could such an one be had) would be adjudged paramount to it.</P>
<P>THERE is another consideration that must totally extinguish and obliterate all possible remaining idea of right, that the patentees of <HI>Wallumscock</HI> may be supposed to have the said tract of land included in the limits of the township of <HI>Bennington.</HI> Only ad∣vert to the date of that patent, which is on the 51th day of <HI>June</HI> 1739, and compare it with the time of the commencement of the settlement of <HI>Bennington,</HI> which was in the spring of the year 1760, and there will be found to be twenty-one years from the date of this patent, to the beginning of the settlement under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI>—in all this time there was not the least settlement or possession made in the pre∣mises; although the express condition of the patent was, that it should be settled in three years from the time of granting. Possibly in all that time the pa∣tentees might have got some <HI>Dutch</HI> tenants on some western part of the patent, which, with the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York,</HI> may be denominated a fulfil∣ment of the condition of settlement; many large tracts having been patented, some since and others longer ago than <HI>Wallumscock,</HI> which are yet mostly a howling wilderness. This practice of the govern∣ment of <HI>New-York</HI> in extending their patents to the eastward of a twenty mile line from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river,
<PB N="142" REF="016183_0142_0F9BCC6793396300"/>hath ever been considered as a disingenious and de∣signing policy in that government; thereby to lay a foundation for intruding on the rights of their neighbouring colonies; and has been attended with many disagreeable consequences, as has been before observed. And as that government have given up their exorbitant claims where they interfered with the right of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> it would undoubtedly be their wisest way to do the same with respect to such claims as interfere with the right granted un∣der the great seal of the province of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> and instead of treating the people that have settled those lands under that title, as rioters and felons; to exercise that justice and humanity towards them, which becometh governors to the governed.</P>
<P>IT remains still, that there be a summary view exhibitted, relative to the rule of right which should take place with respect to the settlers under each government, that are settled on such part of the fore∣mentioned patents as are included in the townships of <HI>Bennington</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And although superio∣rity of title is in favor of those under <HI>New-Hamp∣shire;</HI> nevertheless, as the line of jurisdiction in those times of granting and settlement, was not expressly ascertained or known. Under these circumstances, it would not only be bad state-policy, but great in∣humanity and injustice to the subject; for either the government of <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> to dis∣possess them, inasmuch as both challenge a legal right; therefore, either title sealed and confirmed with the sweat and toil of the farmer is abundantly paramount to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="016183_0143_0F9BCC6850F7B060"/>
OUR authors, in their appendix, page 19th mis∣represent the plea of the <HI>Bennington</HI> people, in saying, <Q>To reason on their own principles, if equity con∣firmed the claims of others under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> on account of priority of interfering grants, it would have afforded a fatal plea against the peo∣ple of <HI>Bennington;</HI> because they ought then them∣selves to have yielded up all the lands which are covered by more ancient patents.</Q> The people of <HI>Bennington,</HI> or rather the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> have ever insisted, that at the time the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> granted those lands they had good right so to do; but that <HI>New-York</HI> had not. This matter is illustrated and proved by many arguments, and real facts in this treatise, par∣ticularly in the 2d and 3d sections, to which the reader is referred. 'Tis true, provided the <HI>Benning∣ton</HI> people had no further considerations in the mat∣ter of title, but the priority of interfering grants—according to this method of arguing, they ought to yield up such part of that town as interferes with <HI>Wallumscock</HI> patent; but the consideration of settle∣ment is undoubtedly, with the many other matters, material to be considered, as argued aforesaid.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through with the remarks on the <HI>New-York</HI> pamphlet, so far as immediately respects the title of those lands which has been the principal cause of the publication of this treatise—shall next∣ly proceed to detect some notorious and dishonora∣ble misrepresentations contained in the pamphlet a∣foresaid,
<PB N="144" REF="016183_0144_0F9BCCB8903E43A0"/>particularly in the appendix. In this brief review, it would be too tedious, as well as needless, to trace the authors through all their disguised and fictitious representations, and intricate windings. Shall therefore pass on with noteing such of their exhibitions as are the most cruelly fallacious; among which the story of the extention of the township of <HI>Bennington,</HI> merely by a vote of the inhabitants at a town meeting, to the westward from where it was intended to be granted, and within seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, is the most flagrantly opprobrious. The story may be seen recorded in the 4th page of their appendix. <Q>The grantees of the township of <HI>Bennington,</HI> discovered that the situation of the tract according to the intention of the grant, would be both inconvenient and unprofitable, as it in∣cluded a large proportion of mountain; and they therefore, by no better authority than a vote of town meeting, presumed to extend it to the west∣ward within seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river.</Q></P>
<P>As this representation in all and every part is en∣tirely groundless, and no pretence of proof to sup∣port it, but is the meer calumnious aspersion of those who have an implacable haired to the <HI>Bennington</HI> people, a positive denial of the facts alledged would be sufficient refutation of those facts. Nevertheless as the assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> have made a principal engine of this infamous story of their own creation, to destroy the good character of the people afore∣said, by representing them to the government at home as the vilest of insurgents and out-laws—and inasmuch as the facts alledged are capable of dis∣proof by mathematical certainly, and sundry demon∣strations
<PB N="145" REF="016183_0145_0F9BCCB95350A038"/>of this sort having been actually made, (though not with a view of disproving this calum∣ny, as it had not then been published,) by admen∣surations of the distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, to the westerly line of <HI>Bennington,</HI> all which agree that it is at least twenty miles. Mr. <HI>Samuel Robinson</HI> for once made an actual mensuration of that distance, and found it to be twenty miles and thirty-five chains; his affidavit and Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Wood</HI>'s toge∣ther with an attested copy of the survey of that town by Mr. <HI>Matthew Clesson,</HI> the surveyor, is thought expedient to transcribe in its following order, which will abundantly serve to exculpate the people of <HI>Bennington</HI> from that odium wherewith they have been branded. The author is furthermore especi∣ally directed by the inhabitants of that town, to <Q>re∣quest the government of <HI>New-York</HI> to vindicate what their assembly have before alledged, by an∣other accurate mensuration of the distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, to the westerly line of <HI>Bennington;</HI> and further notify that assembly, that as omnipo∣tent as they may conceive themselves to be, they must nevertheless recede from the calumny where∣with they have abused the inhabitants of that town, or continue under the relentment of those inhabitants:</Q> Which take an additional affront at the ill usage, inasmuch as our opponents tell us page 3d, it is to <Q>be transmitted for the informa∣tion of the government at home;</Q> and further in∣form that it was to guard against the impositions which from the want of candor, they were appre∣hensive the said settlers, who "spared no art or act of violence," would by their agents deceive the go∣vernment
<PB N="146" REF="016183_0146_0F9BCCBA137EDC28"/>at home, and therefore they had underta∣ken to transmit a narrative of those settler's pro∣ceedings, for the information of that government. It seems the said assembly fully resolved that the set∣tlers and agents from the want of candor, would endeavour artfully to deceive, &amp;c. and that them∣selves were as fully resolved to over match them in a game of that sort, being greater practitioners than peasants: but artful as they are, they made a fatal mistake in advancing for matter of fact that which in its own nature is incapable of proof, and what has been disprov'd by evidence of a mathema∣tical nature, and capable of further dis-proof by ac∣tual mensuration. It is no ways marvellous that those gentlemen which govern in that assembly have an antipathy against the inhabitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> who have had a great share in defeating them in ob∣taining possession of the country of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grants. It seems they are not insensible of their merit, for, say they, <Q>it is to this township erected by a charter in itself void, and so greatly abused, that we are to ascribe all the opposition which has since been given to the jurisdiction of <HI>New-York.</HI></Q> It is evident that these gentlemen have an evil eye upon <HI>Bennington</HI> inhabitants; for, when they men∣tion the opposition to their jurisdiction, they take care to repeat the aforesaid groundless aspersion, by adding these words, "erected by a charter in itself void, and so greatly abused." They still proceed upon this their favorite topic, and draw particular inferences from it to their advantage, <Q>for by chang∣ing the situation</Q> of <HI>Bennington,</HI> <Q>it is made to comprehend a large part of <HI>Wallumscock,</HI> which was granted under the seal of this province so
<PB N="147" REF="016183_0147_0F9BCCBAD87CAD40"/>early as the year 1739.</Q> This their scandalous assertion is twice repeated in page 8th. One of the passages is as follows: <Q>Mr. <HI>Ingersoll,</HI> one of the most eminent counsel of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Syl∣vester</HI> of <HI>Albany,</HI> were concerned for the defend∣ants.</Q> When these gentlemen found <HI>Breakenridge</HI>'s farm to be within seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, and greatly to the westward of what the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> had admitted to be the jurisdicti∣on of <HI>New-York</HI>—they told him that it was impossi∣ble to set up any principle for his defence. Accord∣ingly, when his case was brought to trial, he re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to confess the lease, entry and ousture, agreeable to the rule, and the plaintiff being non-suites, obtained judgment in the succeeding <HI>July</HI> term, against the casual ejector."</P>
<P>THIS is far from being the true state of the case. Sundry causes which had been tried, were determin∣ed against the claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI> perceived it was expending money to no purpose, to maintain a suit at law against the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees, as they had such a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>binaton of interest with the judges, part of which were in∣terested in the <HI>New-York</HI> subsequent patents which interfered with the grants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> though not in those on trial. This, with many o∣ther things too tedious to particularize, was the cause why Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI> would not defend the aforesaid suit in trial; but there was not a word said, (as he informs me) between him and his said attornies, about his farm's being within seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river; nor is it likely ever such a thing was mentioned in <HI>Albany</HI> county; the con∣trary
<PB N="148" REF="016183_0148_0F9BCCBB8F7BCA78"/>being so well known. Undoubtedly, this was wrote "for the information of government at home," thinking the fallacy would not there be detected it being at so great a distance.</P>
<P>OUR authors, page 10th, after giving a narrative of a riotous and tumultuous outrage, committed by the inhabitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> for which proclamati∣on had issued from the earl of <HI>Dunmore,</HI> against the principal authors of the disturbance "which could not be brought to justice," then they introduce a particular charge against Mr. <HI>Breakenridge,</HI> which is entirely destitute of foundation, viz. That he was one of the principal rioters. To this they join the former calumny of the westward extention of <HI>Ben∣nington,</HI> "by a vote of their town meeting;" and add to both these, the groundless story of Mr. <HI>Brea∣kenridge</HI>'s council's inability to set up any principle in his defence, by reason of his being seated "with∣in seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river. "All these fic∣tions blended together, make considerable of a fi∣gure, in their own words. <Q><HI>James Breakenridge</HI> and <HI>Isaiah Carpenter,</HI> were two of the most inexcusa∣ble of all the offenders: the first had seated him∣self within seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, where he knew it was impossible, on their own principles, that he could be protected by the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> claim, he had declined a fair trial, and suffered judgment by default.</Q> With respect to Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI>'s being active in any expeditions (the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> denominate riots, mobs, felony, &amp;c.) it is well known through the country of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, he has not. In the 18th &amp; 19th pages of the appendix, they repeat their former
<PB N="149" REF="016183_0149_0F9BCCBC530723B8"/>aspersion against the inhabitants of <HI>Bennington</HI> in the most virulent and emphatical language—<Q>And what is still more shameful, they contend, they arm, they fight for lands, as a part of <HI>Bennington,</HI> which lies within seventeen miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s river, and which the government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> ne∣ver claimed, but admitted to be beyond their ju∣risdiction.</Q></P>
<P>As there can be no doubt but these gentlemen really wish these things to be true, and having so frequently repeated them as being so, it is conjec∣tured they by this time begin to believe them, or at least think others may; but that the impartial read∣er may have the real truth of the matter, the follow∣ing evidence is exhibitted.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR authors in the twenty-seventh and finishing page of their narrative, discover great invention and subtilty, who after giving an account of the unfortu∣nate circumstances of the town of <HI>Hinsdale</HI> which has, say they, "been taken up by a royal mandamus." This township had first been granted by the govern∣ment of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay, and upon the settle∣ment of the boundary line between the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> in 1739, it fell within the lat∣ter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the inhabitants and proprietors, who in addition to their title, had also the <HI>Indian</HI> right. This township, by the determination of the boundary line between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> fell within the ju∣risdiction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <HI>Howard,</HI> after it had been settled about se∣venty years. The assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> in order to screen their government from the imputation of the blame justly due to so reprehensible a conduct, endeavor to palm it on the government at home, see page sixth, with respect to <Q><HI>Hinsdale,</HI> a township in the south-east corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> county. Even this is not to be ascribed to our government, it proceeded from a much greater, and the highest authority. A mandamus was produced from the crown, on the report of the board of trade, and
<PB N="153" REF="016183_0153_0F9BCCC0DF51D668"/>by the advice of the privy council, which vested the grantee with a right of election, an act deci∣sive in itself, and superceding the agency of the governor and council here, and the usual forms.</Q> A very extraordinary representation! The nature of a royal mandamus is diametrically opposite to this interpretation. The right of election in the grantees, is restricted entirely to crown lands which are unappropriated; in such lands, the grantee has a right of election, and common sense may teach, that neither a mandamus or any other crown grant cansubvert the property which the subject holds un∣der the crown by prior grants; and though there be ever so many alterations in the jurisdiction, sundry of which have perplexed the town of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> yet this should have no effect on the property of the subjects.—These grantees are likewise withheld from interfering on the right of the <HI>Indian</HI> subjects.—Yet, it seems Col. <HI>Howard</HI> had the vanity to locate his mandamus on the old plantation of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> which was firstly appropriated by a purchase from the <HI>Indians;</HI> secondly, by a grant from the govern∣ment of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay, and thirdly, by the government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and fourthly, by an uninterupted possession and occupancy about seven∣ty years.</P>
<P>THE subterfuge the gentlemen make use of to rid their government from dishonor, in making this last grant of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> is very extraordinary; it seems not well calculated "to be transmitted for the in∣formation of the government at home!" who are undoubtedly competent judges of their own man∣damus's, and no doubt will easily discern their last
<PB N="154" REF="016183_0154_0F9BCCC19B89AAD8"/>error to be worse than the first. Such preposterous granting of lands, is criminally injurious to the subject, as it never fails to embarrass the different claimants with many concomitant difficulties. Yet, still to cast the blame due to their government, on the king's mandamus, is more daringly injurious to the highest authority in the nation.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the maner of redress prescrided for the sufferers, viz. the old proprietors of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> is the most shocking piece of contrivance, page 27, <Q><HI>Hins∣dale,</HI> a small township which has lately been taken up by virtue of a royal mandamus, is alone un∣fortunate—but even here the possessors may be relieved, by a suitable compensation, equal to the value of their improvements in crown lands, free from the expence of fees.</Q> These gentlemen in their great clemency have also conceded that the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers in general may be thus consider∣ed, <Q>on the same terms, may be assigned to each of those who are seated on the soil, actually appro∣priated to others by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the possessions of which cannot for that reason be confirmed; such a proportion of crown lands as the governor and council shall judge to be ade∣quate to their respective improvements.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to describe the tract, <Q>a fer∣tile and extensive country, in the northern part of the county of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and between <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river and lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> still remains unpatented by their government, and might be planted and cultivated by these people:</Q>—What a surprising condescention this! the posterity of the original proprietors of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> especially, to be allowed the
<PB N="155" REF="016183_0155_0F9BCCC253EBEE08"/>privilege to pull up stakes, quit their farms and possessions, houses, orchards, &amp;c. and join company with the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers in general, and trudge off to the north-east part of the wilderness of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and there commence another settlement, leaving their pleasant habitations, fields, tenements, and country, in exchange for a howling wilderness; a pretty exchange!—and this to gratify a number of <HI>New-York</HI> cormorants. But, let's stop a little and consider—whether it would not be more righ∣teous to change the scene, and so the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees remove their patents, that interfere with the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, and lay them in she wil∣derness of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> as neither government have ap∣propriated it.</P>
<P>A sufficient reason to be offered in savor of the latter of these projects, is, that the settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> are in deed, and in truth the lawful owners and proprietors of the lands they possess, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demonstrated in the preceding sections. Although these gentlemen have in the course of their narration, flung out very ex∣traordinary hims of rewarding his majesty's soldiery, by the distribution of those lands, yet they may here again be reminded, (which may further serve as the above reason) that his majesty's proclama∣tion directed the soldiery to make their pitches on unappropriated and vacant lands, this therefore they must do, at the hazard of losing their grants or re∣pitching. For those lands which being antecedent∣ly granted by the crown, by the agency of the go∣vernor and council of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> must forever exclude the soldiery from pitching thereon; and
<PB N="156" REF="016183_0156_0F9BCCC316DBEDC0"/>put it entirely out of the power or the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> or the crown, to grant them to a se∣cond person. And when it is considered, that the <HI>New-York</HI> land-jobbers have, long since purchased great part of the soldiery rights, and that for a mere trifle, and laid them out of themselves, at their own risque; their arguments on that subject cannot con∣tribute greatly to the removal of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> settlers, to the exterior part of <HI>Charlotte.</HI></P>
<P>OUR authors have given a tedious history of the suits at law, which have been commenced by the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees, against the claimants and oc∣cupants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and have exhibited many specious appearances of fairness, equity, and impartiality in their trials. However, the reader must observe, that in every of those, so boasted of candid trials, the defendants, by the result, were to be dispossessed of their farms. They then continue to tell of the entire satisfaction of the vanquished, (together with such of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> claimants as attended the courts) relative to the validity of the <HI>New-York</HI> title.—Soon after this, they give a sur∣prising account of riots and outrages, committed by these settlers, and mention <HI>Allen</HI> by name, (who they say, but a little before was so fully persuaded of the validity of the <HI>New-York</HI> title) as one of their lead∣ers. This narrative is in itself incredible, it cannot be supposed, that men who were convinced, they had had an impartial trial at law, and of the insuf∣ficiency of their own title, and the authenticity of that of their opponants, would raily to arm, in defi∣ance of legal authority, and in defence of their own invalid title; especially, after they had publicly de∣clared
<PB N="157" REF="016183_0157_0F9BCCC3D12F1FC8"/>their own sentiments concerning that matter.</P>
<P>Now follows another quotation from our au∣thors, which is no less than a barefaced insult o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those inhabitants, and one of the boldest of misrepre∣sentations. <Q>If the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> claimants im∣agined that they were aggrieved by the decisions of our judges, the means of redress were in their own power; and they ought to have sued their writs of error, and in the legal and ordinary mode, to have referred their cause to the final sentence of his majesty. But to expect a remedy incompati∣ble with the administration of justice, and the rights of the subject either bespeak the greatest ignorance or presumption.</Q></P>
<P>COULD they once get this established, that there should be no access to his majesty or trial, but in this "ordinary mode," it would no doubt, be to their entire satisfaction; trials in that government would then easily become decisive; for in no case wherein the demand of the plaintiff is below the sum of five hundred bounds, a writ of error in favour of the defendant can issue. And the <HI>New-York</HI> attor∣nies who compiled the <HI>New-York</HI> statings, and are also patented under that government, well knew that every action brought against the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> claimants has been designedly laid below that sum. Yet they were possessed of that extreme bold∣ness to aver in express terms, that <Q>if the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> claimants imagined that they were ag∣grieved by the decisions of their judges, their means of redress were in their own power,</Q> i. e. by way of a writ of error.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="016183_0158_0F9BCCC4964A5068"/>
THERE is nothing exhibitted in this <HI>New-York</HI> pamphlet which more sensibly deserves resentment than their pretensions of indulgencies, favors, &amp;c. conferred on these claimants by that government—<Q>To the honor of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> it may justly be asserted, that the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> claimants have received every mark of favor and indulgence which the circumstances permitted.</Q> Such hypocrisy debases human nature, is the pest of society, partakes of faishood and treachery; and what renders it pecularly vile is that it usurps the feat of virtue, and destroys faith in communities, and is the source of cruel jealousy. Had the govern-of <HI>New-York</HI> been truly friendly to those settlers, it had been returned again; and mutual good will supplied the place of hatred and strife. But alas! so long as the fee of the country of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> grants is the object in view, by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> how it is possible for peace and good order to take place, can't well be conceived. Well would it be for that government, and infinitely bet∣ter for the settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> were they annexed to some other government; but they say, no. Query, why? The answer is easy. They would then loose sight of the aforesaid desirable ob∣ject: otherwise, surely they would be glad to part with such rebellious subjects as they represent them to be. For the truth no doubt is, that they are in hopes some better fortune may in future attend them. And that they can take and execute some of the leading men among these inhabitants; and so frighten and impose on the rest; and finally, by this means avail themselves of their estates and subju∣gate
<PB N="159" REF="016183_0159_0F9BCCC55619F198"/>the country. This is all they can desire in con∣tinuing it under their jurisdiction. That they have in reality a view to this, will further appear by some memorable sentences recorded in the 25th page of their appendix. "We may," say they, <Q>readily conceive, that <HI>Breakenridge</HI> and his party, have a∣bundant reason to wish for an alteration of juris∣diction. The public crimes and private wrongs which they have perpetrated, must make them look forward to the hour of tranquility, with the most anxious apprehensions. The injured may then demand satisfaction for all their sufferings—An attonement must then be made to the coun∣try, for the violation of its laws.</Q> Here the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers may read their intended doom, in consequence of the ability of the government of <HI>New-York.</HI> And one reason why this government have not already destroyed the inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> grants, with fire and sword, is their want of ability; and this inability, in great part, consists in this, that the common people in the go∣vernment, are universally of opinion that the inha∣bitants have a good right to those lands, and should not be molested in the peaceable enjoyment of them, and conseqently will not assist their civil officers in taking possession of their tenements, or them as ri∣oters. That they are no further turbulent than what is necessary to defend their persons and properties, from the cruelty and monopoly of their rulers. This is the ground of all the lenity, forbearance and indulgence of that government towards those inha∣tants; and it is hoped, if these excessive favors should be passed over without their thanks, they may yet be excused for the neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="016183_0160_0F9BCCC6110F08F0"/>
As the design of this section was, in a concise manner, to point out some of the most notorious extravagancies of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the subject can't with propriety be passed over, without taking a short review of the forementioned laws of that colony, which are the most apparent portrai∣ture of their horrid malevolence and caprice. Pas∣sing these laws, which are evidently calculated with a design of extirpating the inhabitants, by them laws alluded to from their goodly land, nay, from the face of the earth; is no less than lavishly foam∣ing out their own shame; laws that ought, and are contemned and disregarded by every lover of virtue. Laws and society-compacts were originally designed to protect the subjects in their property. Loyalty and subordination to
such government, is essentially necessary, for the good of society, and all good and liege subjects will support such laws and legislators. But, as in the present instance, when laws, in their original design and administration, are degenerated from the good ends for which laws and government were instituted, terminating in the ruin and destruc∣tion of the society it should secure and protect; from the same principles, viz. self-preservation, the sub∣jects are obliged to resist and depose such govern∣ment. And, inasmuch as those laws, together with some remarks on them, are to be seen in the narra∣tive part of this performance, shall therefore con∣clude, with leaving the reader, from his own me∣ditations, to pass such sentence concerning this mat∣ter as may appear reasonable.</P>

<P>IT may be of some moment, towards the close of this treatise, to exhibit a number of special motives which induced those inhabitants to prosecute settle∣ments on the controverted premises. As,</P>
<P>FIRST, On the good faith of his majesty's grants, by the agency of the government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> the validity of which has been sufficiently argu∣ed. And,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, by engagement from a proclamation by his late excellency <HI>Benning Wentworth,</HI> which for the more public information, is here inserted.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="proclamation">
<HEAD>By his Excellency, BENNING WENTWORTH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain-General, Governor and Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Province of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> &amp;c. A PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEREAS his honor,</HI> CADWALLADER COLDEN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>lieutenant governor, and commander in chief of his majesty's province of</HI> New-York, <HI>hath lately is∣sued a proclamation, of a very extraordinary nature, setting forth, that king</HI> CHARLES <HI>the second, on the 12th day of</HI> March, 1663-4, <HI>and on the 29th of</HI> June, 1674, <HI>did, by his several letters patent, of those dates, grant in fee to his brother, the duke of York, among other things, all the land from the west side of</HI> Connec∣ticut-<HI>river to the east side of Delaware-bay; and there∣in also set forth, and describes the bounds of</HI> New-Hampshire; <HI>in which description there is a very ma∣terial mistake; besides, there is omitted the fact, on which the description of</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>depended, viz.
<PB N="162" REF="016183_0162_0F9BCCC790BD52F8"/>His majesty's determination of the north and western boundaries of the province of the</HI> Massachusetts-Bay, <HI>in</HI> 1739. <HI>And nothing can be more evident than that</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>may legally extend her western boun∣dary as far as the</HI> Massachusetts <HI>claim reaches, and she claims no more; but</HI> New-York <HI>pretend to claim even to the banks of</HI> Connecticut-<HI>river, although she never laid out and settled one town in that part of his majesty's lands, since she existed as a government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When</HI> New-York <HI>government extends her eastern boundary, to the banks of</HI> Connecticut-<HI>river, between</HI> New-York <HI>and the colony of</HI> Connecticut; <HI>and to the banks of said river, between</HI> New-York <HI>and the pro∣vince of the</HI> Massachusetts-Bay, <HI>it would have been full early for</HI> New-York <HI>to declare that the govern∣ment of</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>was fully apprised of the right of</HI> New-York, <HI>under the before recited letters pa∣tent to the duke of</HI> York. <HI>In virtue of the final deter∣mination of the boundary lines settled by his late majesty, between this government and the</HI> Massachusetts-Bay, <HI>all the lands capable of settlements, have been erected into townships, agreeable to his majesty's commands, and a considerable revenue is daily arising to the crown, un∣less interrupted and impaired by his honor's proclamati∣on, which</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>will not be answerable for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At present the boundaries of</HI> New-York, <HI>to the northward, are unknown, and as soon as it shall be his majesty's pleasure to determine them,</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>will pay ready and chearful obedience thereunto, not doubting but that all grants made by</HI> New-Hampshire, <HI>that are fulfilled by the grantees, will be confirmed to them, if it should be his majesty's pleasure to alter the jurisdiction.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="016183_0163_0F9BCCC853328918"/>
<HI>For political reasons, the claim to jurisdiction by</HI> New-York, <HI>might have been deferred, as well as the strict injunction on the civil power, to exercise jurisdic∣tion in their respective functions, as far as the eastern banks of</HI> Connecticut-<HI>river.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The said proclamation carrying an air of government in it, may possibly affect and retard the settlement of his majesty's lands, granted by this government: For pre∣venting an injury to the crown, of this kind, and to re∣move all doubts that may arise to persons holding the king's grants, they may be assured, that the patent to the duke of York is obsolete, and cannot convey any certain boundary to</HI> New-York, <HI>that can be claimed as a boun∣dary, as plainly appears by the several boundary lines of the</HI> Jersies <HI>on the west, and the colony of</HI> Connecticut <HI>on the east, which are set forth in the proclamation, as part only of the land included in the said patent to the duke of York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>to the end therefore, that the grantees now settled and settling on those lands, under his late and present majesty's charters, may not be intimidated, or any way hindered or obstructed in the improvement of the lands so granted, as well as to ascertain the right, and maintain the jurisdiction of his majesty's government of</HI> New-Hampshire, <HI>as far westward as to include the grants made:</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE thought fit, by and with the Advice of of His Majesty's Council, to issue this Proclamati∣on, hereby encouraging the several grantees, claim∣ing under this government, to be industrious in clearing and cultivating their lands, agreeable to their respective grants.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="016183_0164_0F9BCCCA71BFA438"/>
AND I do hereby require and command all civil officers within this province, of what quality soe∣ver, as well those that are not, as those that are in∣habitants on the said lands, to continue and be dili∣gent in exercising jurisdiction in their respective offices, as far westward as grants of land have been made by this government; and to deal with any person or persons, that may presume to interrupt the inhabitants or settlers on said lands, as to law and justice doth appertain, the pretended right of jurisdiction mentioned in the aforesaid proclamation notwithstanding.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>EXTRACT from a Report of the Lords of Trade, to the Committee of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, for Plantation Affairs, dated <HI>Decem∣ber</HI> 3d, 1772.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the fullest examination into all the cir∣cumstances which at present constitute the state of that district between the rivers <HI>Hudson,</HI> and <HI>Con∣necticut;</HI> out of which, the greatest disorders and confusion have arisen. It seemeth to us, that the principal objects of attention in the consideration of any measures that can be suggested for restoring public tranquility, and quieting possessions, are,</P>
<P>FIRST, those townships, which having been o∣riginally settled and established under grants from
<PB N="166" REF="016183_0166_0F9BCCCB513CEEF0"/>the government of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>-bay, fell within this district, by the determination of the northern boundary of that province, in the year 1740.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Those grants of land made with∣in this district, by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> previous to the establishment of the townships laid out by the governor of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> after the conclusion of the peace; and which land now lies within the limits of some one or other of those townships.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Those townships, which having been originally laid out by the governor of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> either continue in the same state, or have been confirmed by grants from <HI>New-York,</HI> and also, those which have since originated under grants from the latter of those colonies.</P>
<P>WITH regard to those townships which fall un∣der the first of the abovementioned descriptions; when we consider their nature and origin, and the numberless difficulties to which the original pro∣prietors of them must have been subjected in the settlement of lands exposed to the incursions of the savages, and to every distress which the neigh∣bourhood of the <HI>French</HI> in time of war could bring upon them; and, when we add to these considera∣tions, the great reason there is to believe that the grants were made upon the ground of military servi∣ces against the enemy; we do not hesitate to submit to your lordships our opinion, that the present proprietors of these townships, ought, both in jus∣tice and equity, to be quieted in their possessions: And, that all grants whatsoever, made by the go∣vernment
<PB N="167" REF="016183_0167_0F9BCCCC10F66458"/>of <HI>New-York,</HI> of any lands within the limits of those townships, whether the degree of improvement under the original grant had been more or less; are, in every light which they can be viewed, oppressive and unjust: But as we are sensible that such subsequent grants made by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> however unwarranta∣ble, cannot be set aside by any authority from his majesty, in case the grantees shall insist on their title; we submit to your lordships, whether it might not be expedient, in order to quiet the ori∣ginal proprietors in their possessions, to propose that all such persons who may claim possession of lands within the limits of such townships under <HI>New-York</HI> grants, should upon condition of their quiting such claim, receive a grant under the seal of <HI>New-York</HI> upon the like terms, and free of all ex∣pences, of an equal number of acres in some other part of the district lying between the rivers <HI>Hud∣son</HI> and <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and in case where any actual settlement or improvement has been made by such claimants, that they should in such case, receive fifty acres of waste land for every three acres, they may have improved.</P>
<P>WITH regard to those grants made by the go∣vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> which fall within the se∣cond description, and upon which any actual im∣provement has been made; they do appear to us to deserve the same consideration; and that the proprietors thereof ought not to be disturbed in their possessions, whether that improvement be to a greater or lesser extent: But we beg leave to ob∣serve to your lordships, that in both these cases no
<PB N="168" REF="016183_0168_0F9BCCCCD9F2E608"/>consideration ought to be had to any claim, where it shall appear that no regular possession has ever been taken, and no actual settlement ever been made.</P>
<P>WITH regard to those townships which fall within the last mentioned description, we submit to your lordships our opinion, that provided such townships do not include lands within the limits of some antecedent grant, upon which actual improvement has at any time been made, it would be adviseable they should be confirmed as town∣ships, according to the limits expressed in the grants there∣of; and that all persons having possession of any shares in the said townships, either as original grantees, or by pur∣chase or conveyance, and upon which shares any actual improvement or settlement has been made, ought not in justice to have been, or to be in future, disturbed in the possession of such shares; nor ought they to be bound to any other conditions, whether of quit rent or otherwise, than what is contained in the grant.</P>

<P>THESE inducements are indisputably authoritative, and need no commentation: Yet notwithstanding the priority and preferance of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> title to that of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the so many corroberating and concomitant in∣ducements to the claimants under the former, to settle and cultivate those lands; yet the assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> in sun∣dry parts of their state of the right, &amp;c. and more particular∣ly through the appendix, treat those inhabitants, merely on account of such settlement, with the most extreme injury; who, instead of arguing, only declaim against them, and go on in a gradation of consequences drawn from false premises, till they have dragged them from their true character of ho∣nest men, to that of usurpers, rioters, and felons. Although the quotations from our authors have already been lengthy, yet that a precedent of their injustice may not here be want∣ed, the following, from the third page of their appendix is inserted.</P>
<P><Q>BUT though the same principles have been explained, and enforced in several acts and proclamations of govern∣ment, as well as on repeated trials in our courts of judica∣tory,
<PB N="169" REF="016183_0169_0F9BCCCD92D8BCD0"/>they have left no suitable impression on the conten∣tious claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> On the contrary, in contempt of the dictates of justice, the decisions of law, and the civil authority, have their encroachments, which were few in number at the time of the royal determinati∣on, been increased and extended in a tenfold proportion; and that in general by men, who cannot plead that they were deceived or ignorant of the nature or merit of their claim, which it appears, were too notorious to have es∣caped their observation, but who in spite of every warn∣ing and remonstrance to deter them, which human pru∣dence could devise, engaged as volunteers on the side of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and wilfully plunged themselves into the controversy. To extenuate their own indiscretion and misconduct, calumny and misrepresentation are their only resource; and accordingly without the least reason, they charge the government of <HI>New-York</HI> with partiality, and every land holder under it, upon whom they have tres∣passed, with injustice and and oppression; asserting, that because they have sanctified their claim by a wrongful possession, they ought peacebly to enjoy the fruits of their usurpation. To mortify their pretentions they have spar∣ed no art or act of violence, however criminal; and after all, as if they were really injured, and the objects of regard, they do not hesitate to carry their complaints to the throne, and by special agents to solicit some extraordinary act of favour, by which their offences may be passed over with impunity, and their encroachments perpetuated in prejudice to those who enjoy a clear title from the crown, under the great seal of <HI>New-York.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As this clamorous quotation is already mostly answered, shall only remark, as to those settlers extending their en∣croachments in a ten fold proportion, since the royal deter∣mination. It hath been fully evinced that this determina∣tion respected jurisdiction only, and the before recited royal order and report of the board of trade, were accounted suffi∣cient to exclude all manner of doubts in the minds of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> claimants of the validity of their title. They
<PB N="170" REF="016183_0170_0F9BCCCE547E8560"/>truly cannot plead that <Q>they were deceived or ignorant of the nature or merit of their claim.</Q> This matter was elucidated by the highest wisdom and authority in the nati∣on; they rejoice in the clemency of their sovereign, and in the wisdom and impartial justice of the honourable board of trade, exhibited as aforesaid, upon which encouragement those claimants have greatly extended settlements on those lands, in a more special manner on <HI>Onion</HI> river and lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> between the township of <HI>Panton,</HI> which abuts on the lake opposite <HI>Crown Point,</HI> and the said river, and north of it almost to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, and preparations are vigorously making to extend these settle∣ments to the very bounds of the province of <HI>Quebec</HI> It is seldom any new country settles with such rapidity, notwith∣standing the oppositions they meet with from the govern∣ment of <HI>New York:</HI> The expence of clearing roads, building mills, moving to and settling in that wilderness country only for two years last past, would amount to no very inconside∣rable sum. And those settlers from the foregoing reasons, do not in the least hesitate, but that they in so fulfilling the conditions of their charters, have and are acting agreeable to his majesty's will and pleasure; and that those labours will not only be for their own emolument, but for the enlarge∣ment of the British empire, and addition of the crown reve∣nue.</P>
<P>THE assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> have been very particular in their history of the tumults and ri∣ots made by those settlers, in opposition to that government, (many of which facts must be confessed to be true) though they have carefully o∣mitted their manyfold provocations, yet, with all their par∣ticularity have given but a very imperfect idea of those transactions. I shall here, therefore, waving particulars, give a general review of the oeconomy of those settlers in their op∣positions to that government. For defending their proper∣ties, they were indicted rioters, the next thing was to defend rioters; then they had two objects of protection, viz. their persons, as well as property: They were at first greatly in∣timidated at the empty appearance of law, that their oppo∣nents
<PB N="171" REF="016183_0171_0F9BCCCF11434FC0"/>were so conversant with, sometimes despairing of maintaining their possessions; yet upon extremity, rather than quit their substance to the insatiable ravishers, would rally and frustrate their designs: Thus, when the sheriff of the county of <HI>Albany</HI> with his posse came to dispossess some of them, they most generally, boldly took up arms and ap∣pointed leaders. Matters having come to this, not long af∣ter, the inhabitants assembled and appointed committees of safety in the several towns throughout their settlement; this general committee have the conducting of the public affairs of the country for its security, till his majesty settles the controversy. They have erected several companies, which by the votes of the soldiers are furnished with officers, these companies form a regiment which are known by the signifi∣cant character of <HI>green mountain boys,</HI> who are generally in the prime of life, well versed in the use of fire arms, and of robust constitutions; probably no American regiment in an interior defence could excel them, or that would willingly contribute to the support of the crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for it is observable, that such subjects that will not fight for their property, will never fight for their king. And, the ge∣neral instructions from the committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing against the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> but on the defensive.</P>
<P>IT is in the nature of things impossible to pass a right judgment on the conduct of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> settlers, without taking into view the treatment of the government of <HI>New-York</HI> towards them. All cases must be determined upon the peculiar circumstances attending; no act can scarcely be conceived of, which, under certain attending circumstances might not be lawful. It will be readily ad∣mitted on the part of those settlers, that, provided the go∣vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> and its patentees have a clear and in∣contestible right to those lands; and that they are intruders, and by force and violence have maintained such encroach∣ments, then, they are truly guilty, in manner as the assem∣bly of <HI>New-York</HI> have alledged: But on the contrary, if those settlers have a legal and incontestible right to those
<PB N="172" REF="016183_0172_0F9BCCCFD125BD70"/>lands, that they prosecute settlement on the good faith of that title, and the sundry approbations of both their title and settlement from the British administration, then, they are not guilty in manner as those gentlemen have declared; and the impartial public, instead of viewing them as usurp∣ers, rioters and felons, will justify them in their conduct, and esteem them as good members of society, leige subjects to the crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and good soldiers for defending their persons and properties.</P>
<P>THUS, is humbly submitted the state of the controversy, which has for many years subsisted between the government of <HI>New-York</HI> and the settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> by im∣partial justice must every act stand or fall; if those settlers are in the wrong, they are criminally so, but if not, then the allegations of their opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</P>
