<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The Discoveries, Rights, and Possessions of</HI> Great-Britain.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE CABOTS, with other Subjects of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>North-Ame∣rica</HI> first dis∣covered by the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> did in 1496 and 1497 discover and take posses∣sion of, according to the Forms used in those Times, all the <HI>Eastern</HI> Coast of <HI>North-America from Cape Florida to the North Polar Circle,</HI> for, and in the Name of, the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> They had a Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt from the <HI>Crown</HI> of the Property of all Lands they should discover and settle <HI>Westward</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> but they made no Settlements in consequence of that Grant. This Discovery of the Continent of <HI>North-America</HI> was prior to that of any other <HI>Europeans;</HI> for COLUMBUS did not dis∣cover the <HI>Islands</HI> in the <HI>Gulf of Mexico</HI> till 1498, and it was 1504 before the <HI>French</HI> discovered any Part of <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>In those Days Priority of Discovery, even without a continued Occupancy or Possession,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prior Disco∣very a good Claim.</NOTE> was deemed a good Claim. It is true, we did not immediately make any Settlements there, nor did we so much as navigate the Coast for near a Century following, <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth being too much engaged in the Difficulties which attended the Progress of the Reformation, to be at leisure for foreign Undertakings;
<PB N="2" REF="007434_0003_102D86183AB918A8"/><HI>Edward</HI> the VIth being a Minor; Queen <HI>Mary</HI> being bent upon the Re-establishment of Popery; and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> being constantly employed in guarding against the Variety of Dangers to which the internal State of her own King∣doms, the Power of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the general State of <HI>Europe,</HI> exposed her. But notwithstanding this In∣attention to <HI>North-America,</HI> and the little Regard <HI>England</HI> at first shewed to the Discovery of the CABOTS, I have shewed it to have been the earliest Discovery made; nor can it be annulled by any subsequent Discovery pretended by any other Country, nor by a neglect of the Improvement of it on our own part. However, as several <HI>European</HI> Treaties have since been made, establishing by Stipulation that Right acquired at first by this Discovery to great Part of <HI>North-America,</HI> I shall not dwell upon the Effect of the Discovery, as confirming a Right, but proceed to state the several <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> Treaties, since made, relative to this Country; the Conveyances made to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> of Part of it by the Natives of the Country; the consequential Grants of the <HI>Crown,</HI> and the Settlements made by his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Subjects.</P>
<P>In consequence of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Commissaries from the Crowns of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> determined the Bounda∣ries of the HUDSON'S-BAY Company's Ter∣ritories,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bounds of <HI>Hudson's-Bay</HI> Company's Ter∣ritories ascer∣tained by Trea∣ty with <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> to be all that Country from the <HI>North Pole</HI> to a certain Promontory upon the <HI>Atlantic Ocean</HI> in N. Lat. 56 Degrees 30 M. to run S. W. to Lake <HI>Mistasin,</HI> and from thence continued still S. W. to N. Lat. 49 D. and from thence continued still S. W. indefinitely; which S. W. Line takes in Part of Lake <HI>Superior,</HI> which is as large as the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea. Though the <HI>Sieur D'Anville</HI> has in his Map of <HI>America,</HI> published in 1750, under the Direction and Authority of the Government of <HI>France,</HI> marked the South Boundary of the above <HI>Company</HI>'s Territories due <HI>West</HI> from the above Promontory, which is so far in∣jurious.</P>

The Limits of NEW-BRITAIN, or <HI>Labra∣dore,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Limits <HI>of New Bri∣tain</HI> or <HI>La∣bradore</HI> not settled by Treaty, and his Majesty's Right to that Country.</NOTE> are not on the South and West Sides as∣certained by any Treaty between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> it being with the Remainder of <HI>North-America,</HI> the Boundaries whereof were not settled by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> referred to <HI>Commissaries</HI> of the <HI>two Crowns,</HI> who were to settle all <HI>American</HI> Disputes, concerning Boundaries
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more impolitic, when we are engaged in a Confederacy against <HI>France,</HI> than to leave any Point to be deter∣mined after the Conclusion of a Peace: for if we cannot get it conceded while the Confederacy stands and our Force is united, how can we obtain it when we are left alone upon the Dissoluti∣on of the Confederacy? The <HI>French</HI> have so often experienced the Benefit of this Imprudence on our side, that in all their Treaties they use every Artifice in their Power to obtain this Ad∣vantage, and they seldom miss it. But when we recollect the weak and traiterous <HI>Ministry</HI> of this Country, who negociated the infamous Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> we cannot wonder that the Interests of <HI>America,</HI> &amp;c. should be referred to <HI>Commissaries</HI> after a Conclusion of a Peace. This Weakness and Treachery in our Managers of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht, when it was in our Power to command our own Terms,</HI> has given Being and Support to most of the Evils that have since happened in <HI>America</HI> between us and the <HI>French.</HI> And one would have hoped the ill Success of this Part of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> would have deterred us from the like impoli∣tic Conduct at the Treaty of <HI>Aix La Chapelle.</HI> But no, <HI>the Neces∣sity of our Situation then obliged us to submit to the same Mistake once more,</HI> and we now see and feel the Consequences of it. For the <HI>French</HI> refuse to settle any one Point in Dispute with us, unless upon such Terms as are abhorrent to our Honour and Interest; they are constantly committing Depredations on our Fellow-Subjects, and making Encroachments, on us in <HI>America,</HI> and will not recede from any one of their Encroachments, though his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Claim to most of the Territories they have invaded is indisputably just; and they have at last pushed Affairs to such an Extremity, that a <HI>European</HI> War with them seems to be inevitable.</NOTE> and the Dominion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in twelve Months after the Ratifications of that Treaty were exchanged. <HI>Commissaries</HI> did
<PB N="4" REF="007434_0005_102D861CF040F378"/>accordingly meet at <HI>Soissons</HI> and <HI>Cambray,</HI> but never settled one Point relative to the Limits of <HI>North-America,</HI> and the Dominions of the <HI>Indians</HI> therein, except the Boundary of the <HI>Hudson's-Bay</HI> Company I have just mentioned. But if prior Discovery and frequent Visitation of a Country gives Title to it, we have an indubitable one to all that Country called <HI>New-Britain</HI> or <HI>Labradore,</HI> extending Southward from the before mentioned Promontory in N. Lat. 56. D. 30 M. to the <HI>North</HI> Side of the Entrance into the Streights of <HI>Belle-Isle,</HI> and from thence due <HI>West</HI> till it meet the Southern Boundary of <HI>Hudson's-Bay</HI> Company's Territories. Tho' the <HI>French</HI> have been careful to colour the whole of this Country upon their Maps for themselves. Three Years ago a Number of wealthy Merchants of the City of <HI>London</HI> peti∣tioned for an exclusive Grant of this Country, for a Number of Years, on Terms that would have been very beneficial to the Public, as well as themselves. Their Petition was re∣ferred to <HI>the Right Honourable Lords for Trade and Plantati∣ons,</HI> who reported in favour of the Project, and proved his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Title to the Country; but for political Reasons it was afterwards dropped. And since that there have been several bolder Attempts than ever of private Traders, Subjects of his <HI>Majesty,</HI> to establish Commerce with the <HI>Eskineaux Indians,</HI> who reside on and near the Sea Coast of this Country, which has from one End to the other been often explored by his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Subjects; but there never was any Establish∣ment made in it by any <HI>European</HI> Nation; for the Natives have an invincible Antipathy to all Foreigners, and destroy all those that happen to be wrecked on their Coast, or attempt to trade with them, whenever it is in their Power.</P>
<P>By the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> which in this respect is confirmed by that of <HI>Aix La Chapelle,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newfound∣land <HI>ceded to the Crown of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>by the Treaty of</HI> Utrecht.</NOTE> NEW∣FOUNDLAND was ceded to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> reserving to the <HI>French,</HI> through the good Of∣ficers of our iniquitous Administration in 1712, Liberty to visit and to erect Huts and Stages for drying Fish from <HI>Cape Bonavista</HI> to the <HI>Northermost</HI> Point of the <HI>Island,</HI> and from

And that the Subjects and Inhabi∣bitants, Merchants of the Kingdoms and Dominions of each Confederate respectively, shall forbear to sail and trade in the Ports and Havens which have Fortifications, Magazines, or Ware-houses, and in all other Places whatsoever, possessed by the other Party in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> or in any Part of <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI> The Board of Trade being consulted on the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> claiming a Right to fish at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> returned the following Answer to Lord <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> Secretary of State, dated <HI>June</HI> 13, 1712. <Q>We have considered the Extract of a Memorial from the Marquis <HI>de Montelon,</HI> relating to a Claim of the Inhabitants of <HI>Guypuscoa</HI> to fish on the Coast of <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> and thereupon take leave to inform your Lordship, that we have discoursed with such Persons as are able to give Information in that matter; and we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind that some <HI>Spaniards</HI> are come hither with Passes from her <HI>Majesty,</HI> and others may have fished there privately; but never any, that we can learn, did do it as of Right be∣longing to them. By the Act to encourage the Trade to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> passed in the Tenth and Eleventh of his late <HI>Majesty,</HI> when we were in Amity and Alliance with <HI>Spain,</HI></Q> it is declared and enacted, <Q>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no <HI>Alien</HI> or Stranger whatsoever, not residing within the Kingdom of
<PB N="6" REF="007434_0007_102D86215E64CEB8"/><HI>England,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> or Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> shall at any time hereafter take Bait, or use any sort of Trade, or Fishing whatever, in <HI>Newfourdland,</HI> or in any of the <HI>Islands</HI> adjacent.</Q> Pursuant to which Act <Q>Instructions have been every Year given to the Commo∣dores of the Convoys, to prevent Foreigners coming thither.</Q> The Secret Committee of the <HI>House of Com∣mons,</HI> in 1715, confess in their Report, that they were at a loss to account for the Reasons that prevailed with the Mi∣nistry to admit the Insertion of the above Article into the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> for the Management of it was intrusted with an <HI>Irish Papist</HI> who was sent to <HI>Spain</HI> for this Purpose, and to negociate what was expected from that Crown relat∣ing to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and no Papers concerning it were to be found in the public Offices. Upon the Foundation of the above Article in favour of <HI>Spain,</HI> we find Don UZTARIZ, formerly Privy Counsellor to the <HI>King,</HI> and Secretary in the Council and Chamber of the <HI>Indies</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> in his most ex∣cellent <HI>Theory and Practice of Commerce,</HI> &amp;c. advising the <HI>King</HI> his Master to avail himself of that Right whenever he has Power sufficient to make good his Pretensions.</P>
<P>ACADIE,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acadie, <HI>or</HI> Nova-Scotia, <HI>ceded to</HI> Great-Britain <HI>by the Treaty of</HI> Utrecht.</NOTE> extending from the River of <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> to the River <HI>Pantagoit</HI> or <HI>Penobscot,</HI> was not only first discovered, but first settled by the <HI>English;</HI> for in 1602 we had, both by the Accounts of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> His∣torians, a Settlement in that Country, which is two Years before ever a <HI>French</HI> Family settled in any Part of it, as appears from the same Authority. In 1620 all that Part of <HI>Acadie</HI> as far as the 48 D. of N. Latitude, was granted by the Crown to the Council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> or <HI>New-England,</HI> which Company I shall have further occasion to speak of. In 1621 the Council of <HI>New-England</HI> resigned to the Crown all Parts of their Grant to the <HI>Northward</HI> of the River <HI>St. Croix,</HI> when it was then granted with the rest of <HI>Acadie</HI> to Sir <HI>William Alexander,</HI> Secretary of State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and called <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> In 1623 King <HI>Charles</HI> the Ist, marrying a Daughter of the
<PB N="7" REF="007434_0008_102D8622EFFF1430"/><HI>French</HI> King, gave all <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> to <HI>France</HI> in 1627 it was taken from the <HI>French</HI> by Sir <HI>David Kirk.</HI> In 1632 it was again ceded to <HI>France</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>St. Germain.</HI> In 1654 <HI>Cromwell</HI> sent and reduced it. In 1662 it was again delivered up to the <HI>French</HI> King by <HI>Charles</HI> II. and confirmed to <HI>France</HI> at the Treaty of <HI>Breda</HI> in 1667, notwithstanding a Remonstrance against it from the Parlia∣ment of <HI>England</HI> and the People of <HI>New-England.</HI> In 1690 it was taken by 700 <HI>New-England</HI> Men, at the Expence of that Country, which was never reimbursed them. In 1697 it was again ceded to <HI>France.</HI> In 1710 it was reduced again by Forces from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> and confirmed by the Treaties of <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> <Q>With its <HI>antient</HI> Bounda∣ries, as also the City of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> as fully as ever <HI>France</HI> possessed them by Treaty or other Means.</Q></P>
<P>From this Summary of Facts there cannot be any Doubt of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s Right to the whole of the Country called <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> And as the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> and <HI>Possession</HI> of it has been so often changed by Treaty and other Means, one would have imagined it impossible any Doubt could have arose about the Extent of it. But it is certain that <HI>France</HI> has ever since the Treaty of <HI>Aix La Chappelle</HI> insisted on its antient Boundaries to have never extended beyond the <HI>South-Eastern</HI> Peninsula, and have accordingly taken possession of all the Country we claim as <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> except the above Peninsula, which is not one third of the Country both Crowns always possessed for <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> be∣fore and since its precise Bounds were ascertained in conse∣quence of the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> as appears by both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Historians, &amp;c. though no Bounds were expressed in the Treaties of St. <HI>Germain</HI> and <HI>Breda.</HI> However, a Dis∣pute arising in the Execution of the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> a Dis∣cussion of its Limits ensued, and it was then stipulated by the two <HI>Crowns,</HI> that St. <HI>Lawrence River should be its Northern Boundary, the Gulf of St.</HI> Lawrence <HI>and Streight of</HI> Canso <HI>its Eastern, Cape</HI> Sable-shore <HI>its South-Eastern, and the River</HI> Pantagoit <HI>its Western.</HI> Which Limits <HI>France</HI> always possessed
<PB N="8" REF="007434_0009_102D862506827548"/>as <HI>Acadie,</HI> and it ever retained down to the Treaties of <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Aix La Chappelle,</HI> when it was confirmed to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> with its <HI>antient Boundaries, as fully as ever</HI> France <HI>possessed it by Treaty or other Means.</HI></P>
<P>Now to proceed regularly and clearly with respect to his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s further Rights in <HI>North-America,</HI> I must state the Process of Grants, &amp;c.</P>
<P>CABOT's Grants being dropped, Sir <HI>Wal∣ter Raleigh</HI> did obtain of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in 1584 a Patent for exploring and planting Lands in <HI>North-America,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Ma∣jesty'<HI>s further Right to all the Country, from the</HI> At∣lantic <HI>to the</HI> Pacific <HI>Oce∣an, lying be∣tween</HI> 34 <HI>D. and</HI> 45 <HI>D. N. Lat.</HI></NOTE> not actually pos∣sessed by any <HI>Christian</HI> Prince: and when he returned to <HI>England</HI> the next Year, the whole Country from <HI>Cape Florida</HI> to St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, which before went under the general Name of <HI>Florida,</HI> was called <HI>Virginia,</HI> in Hon∣our of the <HI>Virgin Queen,</HI> there being yet no distinct Settlements which gave particular Names to the several Places along the Coast. Upon Sir <HI>Walter</HI>'s Attainder, his Patent be∣ing forfeited, several Adventurers petitioned King <HI>James</HI> I. for Grants, and a Grant was made in 1606 to two Compa∣nies (one of <HI>London,</HI> the other of <HI>Bristol</HI>) in one Charter, of all the Country lying from thirty-four to forty-five Degrees of Northern Latitude on the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> and the Islands within a hundred Miles of the Sea Coast, and from the said Coast inland indefinitely, if not actually possessed by any <HI>Christian</HI> Prince or People. Neither the <HI>French</HI> nor any other <HI>Christian</HI> People, but us, had at that Time any Set∣tlements <HI>South</HI> of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, but in <HI>Acadie,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> begun to settle two Years before the Date of this Charter, as appears by <HI>De La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> by <HI>Pere Char∣levoix,</HI> and several other of their, and by several of our own, Historians. Nor had the <HI>French,</HI> as appears from the same Authority, made any Discoveries or Settlements at this Time higher up the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> than <HI>Montreal.</HI> Nor had any <HI>European</HI> Power, but the <HI>English,</HI> any Settlements in any Part of this Grant at that Time. The Grant extends
<PB N="9" REF="007434_0010_102D86271D842AE8"/>upon the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean from the Cape now called <HI>Cape Fear</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Pantagoit</HI> River, which is the Western Boundary of the Country we claim as <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> Indeed P. <HI>Charlevoix</HI> says, M. <HI>Monts</HI> entered <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> or <HI>Sagadahoc</HI> River, which is within this Grant, in 1604; but he also says, he and all the Adventurers with him immediately removed to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Acadie,</HI> and in 1606 they all returned to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Both the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bristol</HI> Companies began, imme∣diately after their Grant, to make Adventures in Trade and Settlements. The <HI>London</HI> Company pursuing them to the Southward of the Bay called <HI>Chesapeak,</HI> and the <HI>Bristol</HI> Com∣pany to the Eastward, beginning at <HI>Sagadahoc</HI> River.</P>
<P>In 1620 a Dispute arose between those Com∣panies about the former's Right to fish at <HI>Cape-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Ma∣jesty's further Right three Degrees more to the North∣ward.</NOTE> upon which a new Patent was granted to the latter, and several other Noblemen and Gentlemen, for all the Country lying from 40 D. to 48 D. North Latitude, which is three Degrees further to the Northward than the former Grant, and takes in the greatest Part of <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> The Grant extends due West from the <HI>Atlantic</HI> to the <HI>Pacific</HI> Ocean, if not then actually possessed by any <HI>Christian</HI> Prince or People. And this new Company was called the Council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> or <HI>New-England;</HI> which latter Name was given to this Country upon Capt. <HI>Smith</HI>'s presenting a Plan of it to the Court of <HI>England</HI> on his Return in 1614, and it retains the Name to this Day from twenty Miles East of the City of <HI>New-York</HI> as far as the River <HI>St. Croix,</HI> and is now divided into the four <HI>Provin∣ces</HI> of <HI>Massachuset's-Bay, New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> surveyed the Coast well, and gave Names to many of the Head Lands, Bays and Rivers, which are mostly continued to this Time.</P>
<P>The North Line of this Grant crosses the North Side of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River a little above <HI>Saguen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> and running due West strikes the North Side of Lake <HI>Superiour,</HI> to which the South Boundary of the <HI>Hudson's-Bay</HI> Company's Territories
<PB N="10" REF="007434_0011_102D862901EB0720"/>do extend. But as the <HI>French</HI> were before this settled at <HI>Quebeck, Trois Riviers,</HI> and several other Places on the North Side of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> below <HI>Montreal,</HI> which are within this Grant, all that Part of the Grant to the Northward of the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> as high as <HI>Moutreal</HI> is invalid. But as they had not made any Settlements prior to this Grant higher than <HI>Montreal,</HI> they have no Right to any part of the Coun∣try to the Southward of the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> below <HI>Mon∣treal,</HI> nor to the Southward of the North Bounds of this Line above <HI>Montreal.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>New-England</HI> Company made many Grants of Land, one of which, in particular, in 1629, gives to Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorge</HI> and Captain <HI>Mason</HI> all that Tract of Land lying from the Heads of <HI>Merrimack</HI> River, and <HI>Sagadaboc</HI> or <HI>Kenebeck</HI> River to the Lake <HI>Iroquois,</HI> now called by the <HI>French Cham∣plain,</HI> and the River which empties itself from the said Lake into St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River opposite to St. <HI>Peter's Bay,</HI> to be called <HI>Laconia.</HI> Part of this Grant was afterwards sold to the Agent of the <HI>Massachuset's-Bay</HI> Province, and confirmed by the Crown in 1639.</P>
<P>The <HI>London</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> Companies, being disap∣pointed in their Hopes of vast Wealth from their Projects, surrendered their Patents to the <HI>Crown</HI> in 1635. And in the Beginning of <HI>Charles</HI> I. new Grants were procured: but by reason of the ensuing Civil Confusions and Divisions in <HI>England</HI> the Conditions of these new Grants were not com∣plied with, and People set down at pleasure and at random. Upon the Restoration of <HI>Charles</HI> II. those Settlers petitioned for peculiar Grants, and had them; but it is not pertinent to my present Subject to trace Royal and other Grants for Lands to the Northward of 34 D. of Latitude any further. But it is necessary to mention three other Species of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Right to a very large Part of the same Country, which he derives from <HI>European</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Treaties.</P>
<P>While the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bristol</HI> Companies were engaged in trading and settling at the two Extremes of their Grant,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's further Right &amp;c.</NOTE> the <HI>Swedes, Fins,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> in 1609 crept into that part
<PB N="11" REF="007434_0012_102D862B77C505F8"/>of it lying from the Lat. of about 38 D. to the Lat. 41 D. N. comprehending the present Provinces of <HI>New-York, New-Jersies,</HI> and some part of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> In 1618 the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> had several Bickerings with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. settled in, and trading to, this Country, as inter∣fering with his Master's Grant. However this served no other purpose than to frighten the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Fins</HI> under the Protection of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who soon after had a Governor appointed by the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Country was called <HI>New-Netherlands.</HI> The Court of <HI>England</HI> complain∣ed, but the <HI>States</HI> disowned it, and said it was only a private Undertaking of an <HI>Amsterdam West-India</HI> Merchant. Upon which King <HI>James</HI> I. commissioned a Governor, and called the Country <HI>New-Albion,</HI> to which the <HI>Dutch</HI> submitted. But during the Civil Troubles in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles</HI> I. Reign, and in the Administration of the <HI>Republican</HI> Party, the <HI>Dutch</HI> again established a Government there, till it was reduced by <HI>England</HI> in 1664. In 1667 at the Peace concluded at <HI>Breda,</HI> between <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> it was stipulated by the third Article of the Treaty that the <HI>English</HI> were to re∣main in Possession of that whole Country, in Exchange for the Country of <HI>Surinam,</HI> which the <HI>Dutch</HI> had taken from the <HI>English.</HI> In 1672 the <HI>Dutch</HI> reduced <HI>New-Albion,</HI> but the Year following, at the Treaty of <HI>Westminster,</HI> it was restored to <HI>England,</HI> with whom it has continued ever since. Neither the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> nor that of <HI>Westminster,</HI> specifies the Bounds of <HI>New-Netherlands,</HI> or <HI>New-Albion,</HI> but in general Terms cedes to <HI>England</HI> all the Rights and Possessions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>The first Year the <HI>Dutch</HI> begun to settle in this Country, they entered into an Alliance with, and by Treaty did ac∣quire the Protection and Sovereignty of, the <HI>Five Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> then living on the South Side of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, opposite to <HI>Montreal;</HI> who are known to the <HI>English</HI> under the Names of <HI>Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onondagas, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Senekas;</HI> and to the <HI>French</HI> by the general Name of <HI>Iroquois.</HI> This Alliance and Subjection continued without a Breach on either Side till 1664, when the <HI>English</HI> upon the taking
<PB N="12" REF="007434_0013_102D862D5B6BCE50"/>of <HI>New-Netherlands,</HI> which from this time was called <HI>New-York,</HI> immediately entered into a strict Friendship with those <HI>Five Nations,</HI> which has held without the lest Breach to this Day.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Proprietor of this Coun∣try from the Time it was taken in 1664 to his Accession to the Throne, ordered the Governors of <HI>New York</HI> to give the <HI>French</HI> Priests all the Encouragement in their Power to settle among the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> But Col. <HI>Dungan,</HI> who was his Governor when he mounted the Throne, though a <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> was so much of an <HI>Englishmen</HI> that he ever persuaded the <HI>Indians</HI> not to receive them, prevailed on them not to make Peace with the <HI>French</HI> in 1687, and effectually prevented them from becoming the Subjects of the <HI>French</HI> King. But his Measures were not agreeable to those his Master had taken with the <HI>French</HI> Court, at whose Re∣quest he was soon after removed from his Government, because he had not procured a Peace with the <HI>Indians</HI> for the <HI>French,</HI> and admitted them to settle and gospelize among them, as the King his Master had ordered him.</NOTE> The <HI>Five Nations</HI> by this Treaty acknowledged to the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> <Q>That they had given their Lands and submitted themselves to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></Q> And in a few Years after they desired and had the <HI>Duke of York</HI>'s Arms put up at each of their Castles, as Tok∣ens of their being Subjects and under his Protection. The above Treaty was made three Years preceding the first the <HI>French</HI> ever made with them, for they were constantly at War with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> as appears by their own, as well as our, Historians, from 1603, when they first settled at <HI>Canada,</HI> to 1667, when they entered into a Treaty of Friend∣ship only, which continued till 1683, when the <HI>French</HI> most perfidiously broke it. The above Right of Sovereignty and Property, conveyed to us, the <HI>Five Nations</HI> recognized by a Treaty in 1684, and by another at <HI>Albany</HI> in 1687. And at this last Treaty, when Col. <HI>Dungan,</HI> Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> could not support them openly, having positive Orders from King <HI>James</HI> II. to procure Peace for the <HI>French,</HI> they expressed themselves to the Governor and Commissioners of <HI>New-York</HI> in these Words, <Q>Brethren, you tell us the King
<PB N="13" REF="007434_0014_102D862F1C90D9D8"/>of <HI>England</HI> is a very great King, and why should not you join with us in a very just Cause, when the <HI>French</HI> join with our Enemies in an unjust Cause? O Brethren, we see the Reason of this; for the <HI>French</HI> would fain kill us all, and when that is done they would carry all the <HI>Beaver</HI> Trade to <HI>Canada,</HI> and the King of <HI>England</HI> would lose the Land likewise; and therefore, <HI>O great Sachem,</HI> be∣yond the great Lake, awake and suffer not those poor <HI>In∣dians that have given themselves and their Lands under your Protection,</HI> to be destroyed by the <HI>French</HI> without a Cause.</Q> All which Grants they further confirmed by several subsequent Treaties, and a Deed of Sale of all their hereditary and con∣quered Country, for a valuable Consideration, in 1701. Which was also renewed 1726; and again, very particularly so, at a Treaty held at <HI>Lancaster</HI> in the <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> in 1744. But as Treaties with the <HI>Natives</HI> of <HI>America</HI> by <HI>European</HI> Powers may not be thought sufficient, or be admitted, in support of a Claim to Property and Juris∣diction, in a <HI>European</HI> national Discussion, unless confirmed by a <HI>European</HI> Treaty between contending Nations for <HI>American</HI> Rights, I have not quoted any, or shall I, (though there are many subsisting in almost every part of his <HI>Ma∣jesty's North-American</HI> Dominions, as much to the Purpose of Property and Jurisdiction as those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI>) but those that relate to the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> because they are fully and amply confirmed by <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the Treaties of <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Aix La Chapelle.</HI> They are there acknowledged to be Subjects of, and the Dominion over them is ceded to, the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and it is stipulated that neither they, nor any other <HI>Indians,</HI> who were Friends to the <HI>English</HI> should be molested by the <HI>French,</HI> but that the Subjects of both <HI>Crowns</HI> should enjoy free Liberty of going and coming to the <HI>Colonies</HI> of either, for the Promotion of Trade as a common Benefit. But as the Treaties of <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> refer the Dominion of each <HI>Crown</HI> over all the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> except the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> to be settled by Commissaries after the Ratifications were exchang∣ed, the Treaties that have from time to time been made by his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Governments in <HI>North-America with the Indians,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="007434_0015_102D8630FA635B70"/>will be of great Service if ever this Affair should come upon the <HI>Tapis.</HI> And if our Governors had known the Importance of such Treaties, they might have improved the Opportu∣nities they have had with more Clearness and Precision than they have done in some Instances, both as to Dominion and Property.</P>
<P>Those Cessions of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> confirmed by <HI>France to Great-Britain</HI> are of infinite more Importance than they appear to be at first sight; for they are further and con∣clusive Proofs for the utter Exclusion of any <HI>French</HI> Pretensions to the <HI>Five great Lakes, all the Country between the Lakes, all the River and Country of the</HI> Ohio, <HI>And a vast Extent of Territory besides.</HI> But to have a nearer View, and to convey a more adequate Idea of the vast Importance of these Ces∣sions, we must ascertain what is the Extent of the <HI>Five Na∣tions,</HI> Hereditary and Conquered Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Historians tell us, that when they settled at <HI>Canada</HI> in 1603,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heredi∣tary Country of the <HI>Five Nations.</HI></NOTE> which is six Years before the <HI>Dutch</HI> possessed themselves of <HI>New-Netherlands,</HI> now called <HI>New-York,</HI> the <HI>Iroquois</HI> lived in that Part of the Country extending upon the South Banks of the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> from the Mouth of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> or <HI>Sorrel,</HI> River, as high up <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> as to be opposite to the West End of Lake <HI>Sacrement,</HI> and from the West End of the said Lake thro' that and Lake <HI>Iroquois</HI> or <HI>Champlain,</HI> and <HI>Iroquois</HI> River to its Mouth, which is opposite to St. <HI>Peter's-Bay.</HI> This being the earliest Account any <HI>Europeans</HI> have of them, we may fairly conclude this to be their hereditary or native Country.</P>
<P>The same Authority acquaints us,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conquer'd Country of the <HI>Five Nations.</HI></NOTE> that they found the <HI>Iroquois</HI> engaged in a just and necessary War with the <HI>Adironda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> or <HI>Algon∣kins,</HI> a powerful Nation of <HI>Indians,</HI> who then lived where the <HI>Utawawas</HI> are now situated, and forced the <HI>Iroquois</HI> to leave their own Country and fly to the Banks of the Lakes <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie;</HI> which, with the Country lying between those Lakes and <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, as low as <HI>Albany,</HI> and the Forks of the Rivers
<PB N="15" REF="007434_0016_102D86334F8DA8B0"/><HI>Delaware, Susquchanah</HI> and <HI>Ohio,</HI> they have ever since made their chief Residence, and do now continue in the Possession of; except those Parts they have sold to the <HI>English</HI> and made particular Grants of, especially upon <HI>Mohawks</HI> Ri∣ver, upon Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> where the <HI>English</HI> Fort <HI>Oswego</HI> was built in 1727, and those Parts about the Forks of the Rivers <HI>Delaware, Susquchanah</HI> and <HI>Ohio</HI> in the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> that they have sold to the Proprietors of that Province. Upon their Removal to this Part of the Coun∣try the <HI>Satanas,</HI> or <HI>Shacuonons,</HI> who then lived round the Lakes <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie,</HI> warred against them; but the <HI>Ira∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> soon drove them out of the Country, and they fled as far to the Westward as the Banks of the <HI>Mississippi.</HI> By this Breach with the <HI>Satanas</HI> the <HI>Iroquois</HI> improved so much in the Art of War, and so far recovered their Spirits, which were before depressed by the <HI>Algonkins,</HI> that now they thought themselves a Match for them: and as <HI>Indians</HI> never forget an Injury, nor rest till their Revenge is satiated, they im∣mediately after their Victory over the <HI>Satanas</HI> renewed the War with the <HI>Algonkins,</HI> in which they had such Success as not only to recover their hereditary Dominions, but also to drive the <HI>Algonkins</HI> from their own Country to that where <HI>Quebeck</HI> now stands, and never rested till they had destroyed the whole Nation, except a few who put themselves under the Protection of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Quebeck;</HI> and those that have descended from them that escaped the Fury of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> are still in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Quebeck;</HI> but the <HI>Al∣gonkins</HI> have never been considered as of any Consequence in either Peace or War, since their Wars with the <HI>Iroquois.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fire Arms and Tools of Iron and Steel</HI> having never been seen in this Part of the World till the <HI>French</HI> introduced them, the Novelty and Usefulness of them, together with their alluring <HI>Toys</HI> and <HI>Tins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Demand for the <HI>Indians Furs</HI> and <HI>Skins,</HI> brought all the <HI>Indians</HI> between <HI>Quebeck</HI> and the Lakes, except the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> to trade: but as the <HI>French</HI> had protected the <HI>Algonkins</HI> and actually assisted them against the <HI>Iroqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> they could not be prevailed upon to have any Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rce with the
<PB N="16" REF="007434_0017_102D863547998E80"/><HI>French,</HI> who thereupon commenced the Allies of all the <HI>In∣dians</HI> that came to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and prevailed on them to join in a War against the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> whom they were now deter∣mined to extirpate, never dreaming of much Difficulty to accomplish it, as they had the Advantage of <HI>Fire Arms</HI> and a vast Superiority in Numbers of <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The first Action after this Coalition happened upon the Banks of Lake <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and proved to the Disadvantage of the <HI>Iroquois;</HI> for the <HI>French</HI> kept themselves undiscovered till the Moment they begun to join battle, and their Fire Arms surprized the <HI>Iroquois</HI> so much that they were put into Confusion. This Victory and the Fire Arms giving the <HI>French Indians</HI> new Confidence, they became fierce and in∣solent, despising the Commands of their Captains, and on all Occasions rashly attacked the Enemy, who were obliged to keep themselves upon the defensive, and to make up what they wanted in Force by Stratagem and a skilful Management of the War, in which they succeeded so well that they de∣stroyed great Numbers of the Enemy, and lost but very few of their own People. One Stratagem they made use of in this critical Conjuncture, was an Acceptance of an Offer made them by the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> to send some <HI>French</HI> Priests among them; but as soon as they got them in their Possession, they made no other Use of them than as Hostages to oblige the <HI>French</HI> to stand neuter. And being now fur∣nished with <HI>Fire Arms</HI> from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they gave full scope to their Revenge against their Enemy <HI>Indians.</HI> The first they met with were the <HI>Quatoghies</HI> or <HI>Hurons,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call them, and the Remains of the <HI>Algonkins,</HI> whom they defeated in a dreadful Battle fought within a few Miles of <HI>Quebeck.</HI> The French own if the <HI>Iroquois</HI> had known their Weakness at that Time, they might have easily destroyed their whole Colony.</P>
<P>This Defeat in Sight of the French Settlements struck Terror into all their <HI>Indian</HI> Allies, who at that Time were very numerous, because of the Trade which supplied them with many use<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conveniences. The <HI>Nipiceriniens</HI> who then lived on the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th Banks of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, fled upon
<PB N="17" REF="007434_0018_102D86370177A028"/>this to the Northward as far as Lake <HI>Abitibis.</HI> The Re∣mainder of the <HI>Quatoghies</HI> or <HI>Hurons,</HI> with the <HI>Utawawas</HI> and several other Nations, scampered off South-Westward. But soon after they began to be in want of the <HI>European</HI> Commodities from the French, and in order to supply them∣selves they returned to <HI>Quebeck;</HI> and by this Means the Places of their Retreat was discovered to the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> whose Re∣venge not being yet satisfied, they immediately after attacked them in their new Settlements, and by the Year 1650 entirely extirpated or adopted all the Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> that resided on both Sides the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> above <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and on both Sides the Lakes <HI>Ontario, Erie,</HI> and <HI>Huron:</HI> which they never could have accomplished had they not strictly fol∣lowed one Maxim formerly in use among the <HI>Romans, viz.</HI> the encouraging the People of other Nations to incorporate with them. Like them also when they have subdued any People and satiated their Revenge, by some cruel Examples, they adopt the rest, who if they behave well enjoy the same Rank and Privileges with their own People, so that some of their Captives have afterwards become their greatest <HI>Sachems</HI> and Captains. In 1672 they conquered and incorporated the <HI>Illinois Indians</HI> residing upon the River <HI>Illinois,</HI> which rises near Lake <HI>Michigan,</HI> and disembogues into the <HI>Mississipi.</HI> And they also then incorporated the <HI>Satanas</HI> that they for∣merly drove from the Lakes <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie.</HI> And the Ri∣vers <HI>Illinois</HI> and <HI>Mississipi</HI> make the Western Bounds of their Conquests, and of their Deed of Sale to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in 1701. They also conquered the <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>Hudson's-River Indians,</HI> the <HI>Delaware, Susquehanah, Ohio,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>New-York, Pennsylvania, Maryland,</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> by 1673. The <HI>Twightwees,</HI> or <HI>Miamis,</HI> residing on the River <HI>Oubache</HI> or St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> they conquer'd in 1685.</P>
<P>In short the nearest <HI>Indians,</HI> as they were attacked, fled to those that were further off, where they followed them, and not only entirely subdued the vanquished, but them that received them. And they carried their Arms and Con∣quests as far as <HI>New-England</HI> and the <HI>Utawawas</HI> River to
<PB N="18" REF="007434_0019_102D8638B0F40350"/>the Eastward, to <HI>Hudson's-Bay</HI> Company's Territories to the Northward, to the <HI>Illinois</HI> and <HI>Mississipi</HI> Rivers Westward, and to <HI>Georgia</HI> Southward, adopting those whom they did not destroy, and making them their Vassals and Tributaries. The <HI>Tusearoras,</HI> that formerly lived in <HI>Carolina,</HI> upon their Expulsion from thence by the People of <HI>Carolina</HI> in 1711, fled to the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and were incorporated with, and to this Day reside among them. And since that they are generally called the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> The <HI>Cowetas</HI> or <HI>Creek Indians</HI> that reside in <HI>Georgia</HI> are in the same Friendship with them.</P>
<P>These Conquests of the Five <HI>Nations</HI> have not proved tem∣porary, or merely nominal, for all the Nations round them have for many Years entirely submitted to them, and pay a yearly Tribute to them in <HI>Wampum,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Money; they dare neither make War nor Peace without their Con∣sent, except those who quit their Nations, and get under the immediate Protection and Support of the French. Two old Men commonly go about every Year or two to receive this Tribute; and their <HI>Sach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms</HI> are often seen issuing their Orders with as arbitrary an Authority as a <HI>Roman</HI> Dictator.</P>
<P>For further Proof of their Right to the Country they have conquered, they have in all their Treaties with his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Governments respecting it, reserved to themselves a Right to demand a further Consideration for all unsettled Lands that they, nor their Ancestors, have not made particular Grants of to distinct Governments and received a valuable Consideration for; and they always do demand a Conside∣ration and have it, as our Settlements do extend further into their Country, before they will execute a Deed of Con∣veyance, insisting that the Country belongs to them in Right of Conquest, having bought it with their Blood, and taken it from their Enemies in fair War. Thus the Proprietors of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> in 1736 bought of them all the Land on both Sides the Forks of the <HI>Susquehanah</HI> River as far South as the Province extends, and to the Northward to those called the <HI>Endless Mountains</HI> or <HI>Kitiochtinny Hills</HI> as far as the Province extends that Way. This Purchase Includes all that Part of the River and Country of the <HI>Ohio</HI> that lay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this Province,
<PB N="19" REF="007434_0020_102D863BA842AFB8"/>which gives us a further Right to such Part. The Govern∣ment of <HI>Maryland</HI> also purchased the Remainder of all their Claims in that Province in 1744. And the Government of <HI>Virginia</HI> paid them in 1744, two hundred Pounds in Goods at Market Price, and two hundred Pounds in Gold, for a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of Sale for the Remainder of all the Lands that are, or may be, by the King's Appointment in <HI>Virginia;</HI> which is another Proof of the rest of the River and Country of the <HI>Ohio,</HI> which is in this Province, belonging to his <HI>Majesty.</HI> But they desired a further Consideration when the Settlements increased much further back, which the Commissioners were at last obliged to give them Encouragement to hope for. The Particulars of which Grants, and the <HI>Indian</HI> Manner of nogociating about Lands, with a full Account of their Treaties, may be seen in <HI>Colden</HI>'s judicious History of the Five <HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>From this Detail of historical Facts, it is plain that the Five <HI>Nations</HI> have a fair and indubitable Title to their hereditary and conquered Country, and they have on all Occa∣sions availed themselves of the Advantages resulting from it.</P>
<P>The Extent of their Right by Inheritance and Conquest is to the Eastward, on the South Side of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> the Western Bounds of <HI>New-England,</HI> and on the North Side of that River, the <HI>Utawawas</HI> River and Lake <HI>Abitibis.</HI> Its South Western Boundary is from Lake <HI>Abitibis</HI> to the North East End of Lake <HI>Michigan,</HI> and from thence thro' that Lake to the River <HI>Illinois,</HI> and from thence down that Ri∣ver to the <HI>Mississipi.</HI> And its Western Boundary is from the Confluence of the Rivers <HI>Illinois</HI> and <HI>Mississipi,</HI> as the latter runs South to <HI>Georgia.</HI> This is a vast Country, ex∣tending about twelve hundred Miles in Length from North to South, and from seven to eight hundred Miles in Breadth, where the Five <HI>Nations</HI> destroyed many Nations, of whom there are now no Accounts among the <HI>English.</HI> But the French Geographers, <HI>D'Lisle, Du Fur, &amp;c.</HI> have in their late Maps limited their Rights Northward, to a South West Line they have drawn from <HI>Montreal</HI> to Lake <HI>Toronto,</HI> where they also bound them to the Westward, and allow
<PB N="20" REF="007434_0021_102D863DBB29A910"/>them only the Country between this Line and our Settlements. However, to point out the Mistakes, or rather designed En∣croachments, of the Maps of <HI>America</HI> published in France, of late Years, by Authority, would be almost to copy the whole of them. Therefore it must give every <HI>Briton</HI> great Pleasure to see our Countryman Dr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> F. R. S. detecting their Mistakes and designed Encroachments, and almost wholly restoring us to our just Rights and Possessions, as far as Paper will admit of it, in his most elaborate and excellent Map of <HI>North-America</HI> just published; which deserves the warmest Thanks and Countenance from every good Subject in his Majesty's Dominions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> never alienated any Part of their here∣ditary or conquered Country to any but his <HI>Majesty</HI> and his Subjects. But in 1672 the French, when at Peace with the Five <HI>Nations,</HI> persuaded them to allow a House to be built on the North Side of the East Entrance into Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> under the Pretence of a Store for Merchandize. Under the same Pretence they built several other Houses the next Year about the Lakes; but they soon converted these trading Houses into such Forts as the Five <HI>Nations</HI> could not reduce without Cannon and knowing how to use them. However they complained to the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> of this Usurpa∣tion, and told him, <Q>They could place no Confidence in the French, for under the Pretence of building Houses that might be a Rendezvous for Merchants, and that only <HI>Beavers</HI> and Merchandize should enter them, they had made them Places of Retreat for <HI>Soldiers,</HI> and for <HI>Arms and Ammunition</HI> of War; whereby they had stopped the Growth of the Tree of Peace that had been planted, and prevented its Branches from covering their Countries.</Q> And the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> protested also against these Forts as Encroachments upon the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s Territories. But notwithstanding this, in 1684, the Year a Rupture broke out again with the French and Five Nations, they built another Fort, with four Bastions, at <HI>Naigara</HI> Falls in the Streight between Lakes <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie;</HI> which was also protested against by the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> as <HI>P.

In 1725 they built <HI>Crown-Point</HI> or St. FREDERICK'S Fort on Lake <HI>Iroquois</HI> or <HI>Champlain.</HI> And since the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> and that of <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> they have built several other Forts, so that now they have twenty Forts, besides Block-Houses, or Stockade Trading Houses, and one Fort they lately took from us on the <HI>Ohio</HI> River, in the Country of the Five Nations which France ceded to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> at the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and confirmed by that of <HI>Aix La Chapelle.</HI> Which finishes what I have to remark on his Majesty's Rights and Pos∣sessions to the Northward of Latitude 34 D; and now for our Rights to the Southward of that Latitude.</P>

In 1698 also, Sir <HI>Daniel Cox</HI> intended to revive a dormant Title to the Country granted as above to Sir <HI>Robert Heath,</HI> but finding the Eastern Coast already planted, he sent two Ships into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> under the Command of Capt. <HI>William Bond,</HI> to ex∣plore the South Coast of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and to make a Settlement there. One of the Ships entered the Mississipi River, and ascended it above one hundred Miles, taking Possession of the Country in the King's Name, leaving in several Places the Arms of <HI>England</HI> for a Memorial thereof. And Capt. <HI>Bond</HI> took several Draughts of the Coast and River as far as he discovered. And it was not till the Year following, when Sir <HI>Daniel Cox</HI> was soliciting a new Patent in <HI>England,</HI> that M. <HI>D' Iberville</HI> on the Part of <HI>France</HI> hit upon the Mouths of the Mississipi, and built a Fort at one of the Entrances, as would have been done the Year before by the <HI>English</HI> if one of their Ships had not deserted them. From these Particulars relating to the South Coast we derive a further Right to the Country lying between the 29 and 36 D. 30 M. N. Lat.

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Origin and Progress of the</HI> French <HI>Discovery and Settlement of the</HI> Mississipi, <HI>or</HI> Louisiani.</NOTE> it appears that he in 1673 travelled from <HI>Canada</HI> over Land, and discovered some part of the River Mississipi, upon which he returned. The next <HI>French</HI> Adventurer was the Sieur <HI>De La Salle,</HI> who in the Years 1679, 1680, 1682, and 1683, went from Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> through the Lakes <HI>Erie, Huron,</HI> and <HI>Michigan,</HI> and the River <HI>Illinois,</HI> to the Mississipi, and returned to <HI>Canada.</HI> In 1684 he went from <HI>Rochelle</HI> in <HI>Old France,</HI> with two hundred Soldiers, in hopes of finding out an Entrance into the Mississipi in the Gulf of <HI>Mexico,</HI> but he missed it, and fell in with the Bay of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> or St. <HI>Louis,</HI> between 28 D. and 29 D. N. Lat. just to the Southward of the South Line of <HI>Carolina</HI> Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter granted by <HI>Charles</HI> II. in 1665. Here he built a Fort, and in travelling by Land in pursuit of the Mouth of the Missis∣sipi, he was murdered by his own People, who afterwards abandoned the Fort at St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> and went to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>da,</HI> without discovering the Entrance into the Mississipi. Thus fell that bold, enterprising, and valuable Gentleman the Sieur <HI>De La Salle,</HI> who was an Honour to his Country, after which the Mississipi was neglected by the <HI>French</HI> till the latter End of 1698, when M. <HI>D'Iberville</HI> made an attempt to dis∣cover its Mouth in the Gulf of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and in 1699 he did discover an Entrance, and built a Fort near the Mouths. In 1701 the next Establishment was made at the <HI>Mibile</HI> River. In 1702 Isle <HI>Dauphin</HI> begun to be settled. But all these Set∣tlements took no Form till 1708. In 1712 <HI>Louis</HI> XIV, granted the Sieur <HI>Crozat</HI> a Patent for all Lands bounded by <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> and by the Lands of the <HI>English</HI> of <HI>Carolina,</HI> all the Settlements, Ports, Havens, Rivers, and principally the Port and Haven of the Isle <HI>Dauphin,</HI> heretofore called <HI>Massacre;</HI> the River of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> heretofore called Mississipi, from the Edge of the Sea as far as the <HI>Illinois;</HI> together with the River of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> heretofore called the <HI>Missourys;</HI> and of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> heretofore called the <HI>Oubache.</HI> With all
<PB N="26" REF="007434_0027_102D864A795A5B98"/>the Countries, Territories, Lakes within Land, and the Ri∣vers which fall directly or indirectly into the above part of St. <HI>Louis.</HI> In the Preamble to this vague, loose, and indeter∣minate Grant, the King sets forth no other Title to it than the Sieur <HI>De La Salle</HI>'s Voyage in 1683, as the first Discovery of the Mississipi, acknowledging also that the King did not give Orders for the establishing a Colony till after the Peace of <HI>Ryswick</HI> in 1697. And the King also expresly declares the principle Object of this Grant to be, that a Communi∣cation may be made between <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Louisiani</HI> by help of the Lakes and Rivers, which of all things we ought to prevent the Continuance of, or adieu to the Peace and Pros∣perity of our Colonies. When this Patent is dated we were at War with both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and that we took no Notice of it at the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> is not to be wondered at, when we call to mind the Characters and Abilities of the Negociators on our Part of that Treaty. In 1714 they built a Fort, which now mounts fourteen Cannon, at <HI>Alibamous</HI> in the Heart of our Subjects the Upper <HI>Creek Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and in the Center of that part, to the Eastward of the Mississipi, of the Province we now call <HI>Georgia,</HI> which Spot we actually possessed thirty Years before by trading Houses for the <HI>Indians.</HI> In 1717 the Capital of <HI>Louisiani,</HI> called <HI>New-Orleans,</HI> was founded. And that Year the Patentee, finding his Enter∣prise very unprofitable, relinquished his Patent to the Regent of <HI>France,</HI> upon which the famous, or rather infamous Mis∣sissipi Company, or Bubble, was formed. This failing, to the Ruin of Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sands, the King took it into his own Hands where it has continued ever since, and is now vastly increased in Inhabitants and Fortifications. This is the Account of the Origin and Progress of the <HI>French</HI> Usurpation of the Mis∣sissipi that they have been so obliging as to publish to the World themselves. And certainly if there be any such thing as Law or Justice upon this earthly Ball between Nation and Nation, the <HI>French</HI> have just as much Rign to that Part of <HI>Louisiani</HI> to the Northward of twenty-nine Degrees of North Latitude, as a <HI>Frenchman</HI> would have to one of the <HI>King</HI>'s Forests in this <HI>Island</HI> upon coming from <HI>France,</HI> walk∣ing
<PB N="27" REF="007434_0028_102D864C97A494F0"/>thro' it, finding only a Notice stuck up at each End that no Person must enter there without a Ticket from the Ranger, and then returning to the Middle and impudently setting him∣self down.</P>
<P>As to the Sieur <HI>De La Salle</HI>'s Discovery of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> or St. <HI>Louis,</HI> Bay,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Settlements in</HI> NewMexico <HI>a Usu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pation on the</HI> Spani∣ards, <HI>and re∣plete with the worst Conse∣quences to the Crown of</HI> Spain.</NOTE> to the South∣ward of the South Bounds of Carolina, and the French claiming it in Consequence of that Discovery, it behoves the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to attend to that especially as it is within three hundred Miles of some of the richest Mines of <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> which perhaps they will experience, before long, the French have as keen an Appe∣tite for as any Spaniard whatever. And no Man I believe can treat this as a chimerical Suspicion, when he recollects the constant En∣croachments the French have made upon the Spaniards in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> or St. <HI>Domingo</HI> ever since they got footing there, and upon all their Neighbours in all Parts of the Globe at all Times. But if they should not further encroach on the Spaniards in <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> if they settle St. <HI>Bernard's-Bay,</HI> there cannot be any Doubt but they will avail themselves of the greatest Part of the Trade of New-Mexico; for by their Settlements at the Mississipi, they are come into a pretty handsome Share of it already, as fully appeared by the Capture of the <HI>Golden Lion</HI> from the Mississipi in the late War, which Ship had an immense Sum of Money on Board that she took in at the Mississipi. And this could not come from thence if the <HI>French</HI> had not ex∣changed their <HI>European</HI> Manufactures for it with the <HI>New-Mexicans.</HI> Therefore it is of the utmost Importance to <HI>Spain</HI> to deprive them of that Part of <HI>New-Mexico</HI> which they claim; and why they did not oblige <HI>France</HI> to annihilate this Claim at the Treaty of <HI>Utretcht</HI> is very easily accounted for, when we recollect <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. had just put his Grand∣son on the Throne of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From the Account I have thus collected of the Discoveries, Rights and Possessions of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in
<PB N="28" REF="007434_0029_102D864E52F9C5D8"/><HI>North-America,</HI> it is clear that <HI>France</HI> cannot have any just Pretensions to any Part thereof from the North P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the twenty-ninth Degree of North Latitude on the <HI>Atlanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cean, and from thence due West to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> except to <HI>fish</HI> and cure Fish at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> to the Isles in the Galf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and to <HI>Canada</HI> or <HI>New-France.</HI> And these they could never have had any Pretensions to if <HI>North-Ame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca</HI> had from the original Discovery of the <HI>Cabots</HI> been pro∣perly attended to by <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>By the above State of his Majesty's Rights,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Limits of</HI> Canada <HI>or</HI> NewFrance <HI>which the</HI> French <HI>a∣vailed them∣selves of by the Neglects of</HI> England.</NOTE> <HI>Canada</HI> is pared down to very narrow Limits, compared with what the <HI>French</HI> Historians and Map-makers (under the Authority of Govern∣ment) delineate it to be. But there is no Foundation for any Pretence to extend this <HI>Province to the Northward beyond the South Bounds of</HI> Hudson's-Bay <HI>Company's Territories and</HI> New-Britain <HI>or</HI> Labradore; <HI>to the Westward beyond Lake</HI> Abitibis <HI>and the Course of the</HI> Utawawas <HI>River that disembogues directly op∣posite to</HI> Montreal; <HI>to the Southward beyond the North Side of the River of St.</HI> Lawrence; <HI>and to the Eastward beyond the Limits of</HI> New-Britain <HI>or</HI> Labradore. I say this is <HI>Canada</HI> or <HI>New-France,</HI> and no Authority can be produced for its Extention any way. And this is the only Footing the <HI>French</HI> are entitled to upon the Continent of <HI>North-America.</HI> And I do repeat that they never would have had even this if the Court of <HI>England</HI> had but attended to its Interests in <HI>North-America.</HI> For the <HI>Cabots</HI> first explored the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and two <HI>English</HI> Ships went up the River in 1527. Secretary <HI>Walsingham</HI> being informed of an Opening South of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> fitted out Sir <HI>Humphry Gilbert,</HI> who sailed up St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River and took Possession for the Crown of <HI>England</HI> in 1583. And it was 1603 before the <HI>French</HI> be∣gun to settle any where within the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> according to their own Historians. In 1629 <HI>Canada</HI> was taken from the <HI>French</HI> by Sir <HI>David Kirk,</HI> but it was given them by the Treaty of St. <HI>Germain</HI> in 1632 without any
<PB N="29" REF="007434_0030_102D86519EB4CB48"/>Specification of Limits, which gives them all the Right they have to any Part of it. And Queen <HI>Anne</HI> in 1711, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he purposed the Reduction of it, dispersed a <HI>Manifesto</HI> in the Country, setting forth, <Q>That <HI>Canada</HI> belonged to the <HI>English</HI> by Priority of Discovery, and what the <HI>French</HI> possessed there was by Grants from the <HI>English,</HI> and consequently held it only as a Fief, therefore where the Possessors turn Enemy, it reverts.</Q> I am not Lawyer enough to deter∣mine the Validity of such a Claim, but we may be assured nothing but the <HI>longest Sword</HI> will ever settle the Limits of this Province.</P>
<P>Thus the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s Rights and Possessions in <HI>North-America</HI> stand in Opposition to those of <HI>France;</HI> and by the Law of Nations our Claims are certainly valid with <HI>Europeans</HI> against <HI>Europeans</HI> that encroach upon <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Claims thus founded.</P>
<P>But methinks I hear the sober and thinking Part of Mankind say,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Majesty'<HI>s Colonies accus∣ed of Frauds, Abuses, and Cruelties to the</HI> Indians, <HI>and the Crown of having no Ti∣tle to</HI> America <HI>from them.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Though our Claims may be valid against <HI>France,</HI> how came we by those Rights and Possessions? They did not come to us by Inheritance? Prior Dis∣covery and Pre-occupancy gives only a Right to derelict Lands, which those of <HI>North-America</HI> were not, being full of In∣habitants, who undoubtedly had as good a Title to their own Country as the <HI>Euro∣peans</HI> have to theirs. Nor could our Right arise from Conquest, if we did conquer the Natives; as it is hard to conceive how a Conquest, where there was no preceding Injury or Provocation, could create a Right. Therefore all a <HI>European</HI> Power could give, was an ex∣clusive Grant to particular Subjects for negociating and purchasing from the natural Lords and Proprietors, and thereupon a Power of Jurisdiction. We fear the first Set∣tlers of our Provinces never treated the <HI>Savages</HI> well, but encroached upon their Lands by Degrees till they fraudu∣lently or forcibly turned them out of all, using the barba∣rous Methods, in some measure, practised by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="007434_0031_102D865355B1A278"/>on the Southern Continent of <HI>America,</HI> which have made them detestable to the whole <HI>Christian</HI> World.</Q></P>
<P>These and such like Enquiries, Doubts and Fears, I have often met with since I came to <HI>Europe.</HI> Nay, this very Week a Pamphlet has been published, calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>State of the</HI> British <HI>and</HI> French <HI>Colonies,</HI> &amp;c. which accuses his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Colonies with committing Frauds, Abuses, Encroachments, Murders, and every Species of Villainy, against the poor <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>North-America,</HI> by which they have been alienated from, and induced to take up Arms with the <HI>French</HI> against Us; and all the Evils <HI>America</HI> labours under have been thus produced.

Even <HI>Mather</HI> himself, said <HI>Oldmixon</HI> in his <HI>Bri∣tish Empire</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> had eighty-seven Falshoods in fifty-six Pages. In short, there is not one Work yet published to the World in our Language that in any Degree deserves the Title of a <HI>History</HI> of <HI>North-America,</HI> but <HI>Smith's History of</HI> Virginia, <HI>and</HI> Douglas<HI>'s Summary, Historical and Political, of the first Planting, progressive Improvements, and present State of the</HI> British <HI>Settlements in</HI> North-America, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> published a few Years ago at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> And this last is valuable for being the best Collection of Facts in general, for a future Historian, that was ever made or published.

And this is the only Authority, with a few of them having gone over to the <HI>French,</HI> that can be produced for their denying their Subjection, since it took place in 1664, or of their disputing his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Right to their Territories since their Deed of Sale for them in 1701, except when the Conditions of their Deed has not been complied with, which sometimes has happened till a Congress could be held by the Provinces with them. This Author has also proposed a Plan for settling the Limits of <HI>North America</HI> with the <HI>French,</HI> whereby he gives the <HI>French</HI> Two Thirds of the Whole, for the Sake of enjoying the other Third in Peace and Quiet. Now can any Man, upon cool Reflection, imagine, that if the <HI>French</HI> are suffered to avail themselves of, and settle, Two-Thirds of <HI>North-America,</HI> we shall enjoy the other Third in Peace? No; if we submit to this, and may judge of the future by what is past, they will soon have the other Third also. And by making such Proposals, does it not look as if we doubted the Validity of our Right to the Whole of our Claim? Good God! why should we give up an Inch of that Territory which is our just Right, when we are not only able to secure it to ourselves, but to make the <HI>French</HI> hold what properly belongs to them by no other Tenure than that of the Mercy of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> Therefore may Perdition seize every Proposal that gives them an Acre of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s just Rights and Possessions.</P></NOTE> and some particular
<PB N="32" REF="007434_0033_102D8657C71E1CF0"/>Instances, from other Authorities, of Cruelty and Injustice between private Persons and the <HI>Indians,</HI> from which we ought not to form an Opinion of any People.</P>
<P>I thought myself obliged to make this Preface, before I came to wipe off the unworthy Aspersions that have been cast on the first Settlers of <HI>North-America</HI> in direct Terms, supported by Evidence.</P>
<P>Our first Settlers, far from <HI>Spanish</HI> Injus∣tice and Cruelty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Majesty's <HI>Subjects in</HI> North-Ame∣rica <HI>acquitted of the Charge of Frauds, Abuses and Cruelties to the</HI> Natives, <HI>and his Ma∣jesty's</HI> Title <HI>to</HI> North-America <HI>ac∣quired from the</HI> Indians <HI>proved to be just and fair.</HI></NOTE> sought to gain the Natives by strict Justice in their Dealings with them, as well as by all the Endearments of Kind∣ness and Humanity. To lay an early Foun∣dation for a firm and lasting Friendship, they assured the <HI>Americans</HI> that they did not come among them as Invaders but Purchasers, and therefore called an Assembly of them together to enquire who had the Right to dispose of their Lands; and being told it was their <HI>Sachems</HI> or Princes, they thereupon agreed with them for what Districts they bought, publickly and in open Market. If they did not pay a great Price for their Purchases, yet they paid as much as they were worth. For it must be considered that Lands were of little Use to the Natives, and therefore but of little Value. They lived chiefly on Fish and Fowl and Hunting, because they would not be at the Pains to clear and break up the Ground. And as for their Meadows and Marshes, they were of no Use at all, for want of Neat Cattle
<PB N="33" REF="007434_0034_102D865A2FBCDB10"/>to feed them, of which there were none in those Parts of the World. The <HI>English</HI> had no sooner made some necessary Provision for themselves, than they applied their Cares for the Benefit of the <HI>Indians,</HI> by endeavouring to bring them from their wild Manner of Life to the civil and polite Customs of <HI>Europe.</HI> For this Purpose they marked out Land to build <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, supplied them with all proper Utensils for Building, prescribed to them Forms of Government, and above all omitted no Pains to bring them acquainted with the Gospel; for whatever the first <HI>Adventurers</HI> to <HI>North-America</HI> might be, the first real <HI>Settlers</HI> were industrious, peaceable, conscientious Persons, dissenting from the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the established Church, though agreeing with it in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> who removed into those remote Regions, upon no other View than to enjoy the Liberty of their Consciences without Hazard to themselves, or Offence to others; they were not Crimi∣nals, nor were they necessitous; nor had they, with their Brethren, made any Attempt to overthrow the Church and State at Home, and being disappointed therein went to <HI>America</HI> to secure a Retreat for their Brethren, as the high-flying Mr. <HI>Salmon</HI> vainly imagines, and most falsely and injuriously asserts they did. And what I say of them, their uniform proper Conduct, and meek Principles of Obedience, on all Occa∣sions, fully prove. After they were arrived some time, and it was found necessary, they made Laws to forbid any Person purchasing Lands without the Approbation of the Legisla∣ture, to prevent the Natives being over-reached, or ill used in their private Bargains: And those Lands, lying most con∣venient for them, have in most of our Colonies been made unalienable, and never to be purchased out of their Hands, than which nothing could more demonstrate the Colonies Care and Concern for the Natives. And this their Conduct to them is fully and conclusively proved by the Laws of al∣most every one of our <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies. Yet nothing could oblige the <HI>Indians</HI> to Peace and Friendship in some of our Provinces. They were alarmed with strong Jealousies of the growing Power of the <HI>English,</HI> therefore began a War with a Resolution to extirpate them, before they had too well
<PB N="34" REF="007434_0035_102D865BC4223658"/>established themselves, which forced our People to pursue them through all their Recesses, till they obliged them to enter into a solemn Treaty of Peace. Such however was the perfidious Nature of some of the <HI>American</HI> Savages, that they soon renewed their Hostilities, though to their own fatal Cost. And ever since the Settlement of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada,</HI> many Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> have almost constantly, both in Peace and War with the <HI>Two Crowns,</HI> been animated and assisted by them to war against some one or other of our Colonies, and have given them but few Intervals of Peace, and those very short ones, to this Day.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the wise, just, and humane Con∣duct of our Colonies, in a legislative Character, which has also been extended to all Dealings and Intercourse with the Natives, I am sensible great Frauds and Abuses have been imposed upon the <HI>Indians</HI> by private People, in Defiance of the severest Laws, and the most punctual Execution of them on Offenders when detected. But Experience daily con∣vinces us that in the wisest and best regulated Societies, Laws framed with the greatest Care, and the nicest Judgment, are eluded and violated; and therefore no wonder if Infant Colo∣nies should find the same Disregard to Laws, which is to be seen uncorrected under Governments of the longest Duration and most improved Policy. Consequently there would be just as much Propriety in charging the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> with being Sharpers, Thieves, Robbers, and Murderers, because every Month a Dozen or two of Persons in this Kingdom are convicted of, and punished for, these Crimes, and many more escape both; as it is to charge the Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with Frauds, Abuses, Encroachments, and Murders upon the poor <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> because a few among them have been so hardy and diabolical as to perpetrate such Villainies, some of whom have been punished, and some have escaped.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Claims in <HI>North-America</HI> are not only valid in Opposition to those of <HI>France,</HI> but he also derives a Right from the <HI>native</HI> Proprietors of the Soil, his Subjects there having purchased part with their Money, and the rest has been yielded to them by the true Owners, who
<PB N="35" REF="007434_0036_102D865F027034E0"/>have put themselves and their Lands under the Superinten∣dency and Protection of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that they might be secured against the Encroachments and Depre∣dations of the <HI>French.</HI> And the Right resulting from the Purchases and Cessions of the Natives, as much as it is de∣cried and undervalued by some People, is in fact the only just and equitable one. Therefore I am extremely sorry to see any of his Majesty's Subjects, at this critical Conjuncture es∣pecially, endeavouring to prove that we derive no Title from the <HI>Natives,</HI> and that they are not the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for it not only gives <HI>France</HI> a handle against us, but it makes many of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s sober and thinking Subjects doubt the Justice of our Cause, and when this is the Case they do not assist in the common Cause with that Spirit and Ability they otherwise would do, and which was never wanted to be exerted to the utmost, more than at this present Time.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE first <HI>French</HI> that ever appeared in <HI>North-America,</HI> according to their own Historians, were some Fish∣ermen from <HI>Normandy,</HI> who fished on the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> in 1504. In 1506 the Sieur <HI>Denis</HI> discovered the Entrance into St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River. In 1508 <HI>Thomas Aubart</HI> entered the River St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI>

N. Lat. He also sailed up the River St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and then returned to <HI>France</HI> without making any Settlement. In 1534 <HI>Cartier</HI> discovered <HI>Newfoundland, Baye Chaleur</HI> in the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> cruized along the Coast of <HI>Acadie,</HI> and went up the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> as high as <HI>Montreal,</HI> taking Possession for <HI>France,</HI> but made no Settlement. In 1540 <HI>Roberval</HI> built a Fort at <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> but soon abandoned it.

In 1602 <HI>Chauvin</HI> sailed up the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> as high as <HI>Trois Rivieres.</HI> In 1603 <HI>Monts</HI> entered <HI>Port-Mutton</HI> in <HI>Acadie,</HI> visited the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sle of St. <HI>Croix,</HI> sailed as far as <HI>Kennebec</HI> River in <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="007434_0038_102D86646D6039E8"/>then went to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Acadie,</HI> and returned to <HI>France</HI> in 1606 with all his People. In 1603 the <HI>French</HI> first began to settle on the River St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> on the North Side near <HI>Trois Rivieres,</HI> and in 1608 at <HI>Quebeck.</HI> They went on settling on the North Side of the River only, between <HI>Quebeck</HI> and <HI>Montreal,</HI> till 1629, when Sir <HI>David Kirk</HI> re∣duced <HI>Quebeck</HI> and its Dependencies, called <HI>Canada</HI> or <HI>New-France,</HI> to the Obedience of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which was restored to <HI>France</HI> by Treaty in 1632, and they have remained in Possession of it ever since. But certainly they derive no Right by this Cession to any further Extent of Territory than what was taken from them, which was only the District and Settlements between <HI>Quebeck</HI> and <HI>Montreal</HI> on the North Side of the River.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The Encroachments and Depredations of the</HI> French <HI>upon his Majesty's Territories in</HI> North-Ame∣rica <HI>in Times when Peace subsisted in</HI> Europe <HI>between the Two Crowns,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SHALL state the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments and Depre∣dations in each of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Provinces of <HI>North-America,</HI> as the Continent is now divided by the Authority of the <HI>Crown,</HI> beginning to the <HI>Northward;</HI> where∣by we shall have a clearer Idea of their Situation and Impor∣tance, and of the Propriety of the Measures hereafter to be humbly proposed for extirpating the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI> out of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Territories.</P>
<P>Since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> they have erected in <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> one Fort at <HI>Beau bassin</HI> in the Cod of the <HI>Bay of Fundy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French <HI>En∣croachments and Depre∣dations in his Majesty's Province of</HI> Nova-Scotia</NOTE> and on the South Side of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of the South Eastern Peninsula. And another Fort at <HI>Baye Verte</HI> on the North Side of this <HI>Isthmus,</HI> which is not more than twelve Miles wide between these two Forts. From hence they have fur∣nished the <HI>Cape Sable,</HI> or <HI>Mickmac,</HI> and the <HI>Island</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Indians,</HI> who make about three hundred fighting Men, with Arms, Ammunition, Provisions and Cloathing. Upon our Attempt to colonize this Province immediately after the late War with <HI>France,</HI> they spirited up these <HI>Indians</HI> to war a∣gainst us, by their ample Supplies; by their giving them a large Bounty for every <HI>English</HI> Prisoner they brought to them, and a much larger for every <HI>English</HI> Scalp they could produce;
<PB N="40" REF="007434_0041_102D866AC119FF68"/>by their promising to protect them in their Forts; and by disguising themselves and occasionally joining the <HI>Indians</HI> in their Enterprizes against our Settlements. With these three hundred <HI>Indians</HI> they have constantly harrassed our infant Colony of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> so that we have made no Settlements but what have been fortified and picketed all round, which has been attended with vast Expence. Indeed it is hard to conceive what Distress this handful of <HI>Indians</HI> have reduced this Colony to. They cannot clear and break up the Ground, nor plant nor sow without their Pickets, nor go from one Vil∣lage to another for Relief without imminent Danger, from skulking <HI>Indians,</HI> of being killed and having their Scalps car∣ried away for the French Bounty, or of being taken and either put to Death in the most cruel Torments that savage Bru∣tality can invent, or of being carried away Captive to the French, who have afterwards insisted on a Price for their Re∣demption, equal to the Price <HI>black Slaves</HI> are sold for in our Colonies, under the specious Pretence of their having paid it to the <HI>Indians</HI> to save from being put to Death. Thus the French have made us pay the very Bounty they gave the <HI>Indians</HI> for captivating our People. The <HI>Indians</HI> surprized the Village of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> one Night, and altho' it had a Guard of Soldiers and was picketed in, they burnt the Houses, and put both Men, Women and Children to death. And from our first Attempt to settle it since the late War with <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> have been killing or captivating our Peo∣ple whenever Opportunity presented.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> also, as soon as they had built those two Forts, threatened to destroy all the <HI>French</HI> Subjects of his <HI>Majesty</HI> and burn their Settlements without their Forts on the Peninsula, if they did not retreat into the Country within their Forts; therefore they, who have always inclined to the <HI>French</HI> on account of their Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' ever indulged in the free Exercise of that and every thing else, burnt their Houses, de∣stroyed their Plantations, and went under the Prorection of the <HI>French,</HI> who assured them of ample Amends for their Losses and Sufferings. Here they are protected and nourished in an Antipathy to his Majesty, his Government, and his
<PB N="41" REF="007434_0042_102D866D4E1FA578"/>People, and prove as good Subjects to the <HI>French King</HI> as any he has in <HI>America.</HI> These People became the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> when <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> was re∣duced in 1710, upon Condition they did not take up Arms for, nor against us. But, contrary to their Oaths of Allegi∣ance, many of them have been detected in joining the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> both in Peace and War against his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Subjects. There may be in this Province about ten thousand of these <HI>French Neutrals,</HI> as they are called, though some make them amount to fifteen thousand, and others but to seven thousand. Thus the <HI>French</HI> have a powerful Colony in the Heart of this his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Province.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have also re-built a Fort in this Province since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chappelle,</HI> at the Entrance into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, on the Western Side of the Bay of <HI>Fundy</HI> opposite to, and distant ten Leagues from <HI>Annapolis-Royal;</HI> by which they have the Command of the River St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Indians,</HI> being about an hundred and fifty fighting Men, whom they occasionally issue upon the People of the North-East Parts of <HI>New-England.</HI> At the Entrance into this River there is a capacious Road for Ships of any Burthen, and on the North-Side of the Road is a Streight, not Pistol Shot over, through which there is no passing but at the Top of the Tide when the Water is upon a Level, for at other times the Fall is so considerable, especially at low Water, as to make a Descent of thirty Feet. This Entrance on which the <HI>French</HI> Fort stands, is lined on both Sides by a solid Rock, and has more than forty Fathom of Water in its Middle. When you have passed this Streight the River spreads itself half a Mile in Width, and with a gentle Current towards its Outlet admits a delightful Navigation for large Ships, sixty Miles into the Country, and much further for smaller Vessels; taking its Source from three parts of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, one of which is directly opposite to <HI>Quebeck.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> have often conveyed Succours and Merchandize from <HI>Old France</HI> to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> both in Peace and War, up this River, to avoid the Difficulty and Risque of the Navigation of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River. By this River also they, as Occasion requires, convey
<PB N="42" REF="007434_0043_102D866F33F6A490"/>Troops and Stores from <HI>Quebeck</HI> to the <HI>Neutral French,</HI> the <HI>Indians,</HI> and their other Forces in <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> And if they are suffered to remain in Possession of this River they may al∣ways have a Communication between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Canada</HI> in Winter, which they cannot have only from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>October</HI> by St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, and they will at all times have a much more safe and easy Conveyance to and from <HI>Canada</HI> than by St. <HI>Lawrence.</HI> But what is more material they will be fur∣nished with a Harbour, more commodiously situated for an∣noying the <HI>British</HI> Colonies, by Men of War and Privateers in Time of War, than that <HI>American Dunkirk Louisbourg</HI> it∣self; and at all times a convenient Port near the Ocean for furnishing Naval Stores to <HI>Old France,</HI> and their <HI>Sugar</HI> Colo∣nies with <HI>Lumber</HI> of all sorts for the Construction of Dwelling Houses, Sugar Mills, and Cask to contain their Islands pro∣duce, which is what they have long aimed at, but never could secure before. In short there is not one Advantage we derive from the four Provinces of <HI>New-England,</HI> that they will not reap from this River when the Country comes to be fully settled by them. And they are bent upon securing a Footing upon or near the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean, as they have not one Port, or any Territory in their own <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies near it, but the Islands in the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which yield them nothing but a Security for their Fishery, and a Situa∣tion to distress and annoy our Colonies, and their Trade and Navigation, in Time of War. The <HI>French</HI> also deny our Right to navigate or visit any Part of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> in the Gut of <HI>Canso</HI> and Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> or to visit and settle <HI>Canso,</HI> which we settled soon after the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> as part of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and carried on our principal Fishery at, till the late War when they took it from us; but Sir <HI>William Pepperell</HI> recovered it in his way to the Siege of <HI>Louisbourg.</HI> And every Year since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> the Go∣vernor of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and the Commanders in Chief of the Men of War that have been stationed there, have given public Notice that they will seize and confiscate all <HI>English</HI> Vessels they find at <HI>Canso,</HI> the Gut of <HI>Canso,</HI> or in the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="007434_0044_102D867130A4ED38"/>
By those three Forts they have availed themselves of all the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> except the <HI>South-Eastern</HI> Penin∣sula. And although they do not dispute our Right to this, except <HI>Canso</HI> and the Harbours in the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> they have not suffered us to enjoy it since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle,</HI> but by their Encroachments and Depredations have so annoyed and distressed us, that we have not been able to do any more towards settling, even the Peninsula, than to establish four small Towns, and build four small Forts, which has been accomplished with vast Expence of Blood and Trea∣sure. I think the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have granted since the late War 450,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for settling and securing <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and all we have to shew for this immense Sum is the above four Towns or Villages, and four Forts.</P>
<P>Since the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> the French have settled seven Villages in the Province of the <HI>Massachusets-Bay</HI> on the South Banks of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River between the Isle of <HI>Orleans</HI> and the Mouth of <HI>Iroquois,</HI> or <HI>Sorrel</HI> River.

<P>Two hundred French <HI>Indians,</HI> accompanied by some <HI>Canadeans</HI> disguised like <HI>Indians,</HI> made an Irruption into this Province last Year, surprized the Town of <HI>Housack,</HI> sacked and burnt it, and massacred and captivated both Men, Women and Children, except a very few that ran away.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> seized several of our Traders in the Country of the Five <HI>Nations,</HI> confiscated their Effects, and made them pay the Price of Slaves for their Redemption.</P>
<P>They have been continually, since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle,</HI> using every Artifice, and frequently Force, to draw off the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Province as well as in all the rest from the <HI>British</HI> Interest. Last Year they persuaded one half of the <HI>Onondago Indians,</HI> one of the Five <HI>Nations,</HI> with several from the other Nations, to remove from the Place of their usual Residence to a Place called <HI>Osweegachic</HI> on the River <HI>Cadaraqui,</HI> where they have built them a Church and Fort. Many of the <HI>Senekas,</HI> the most numerous Nation of the Five, appear to be wavering and rather inclined to the French. In short, a great Defection manifests itself among all the Five <HI>Nations,</HI> for not more than a hundred and fifty of the several Nations attended the Congress held at <HI>Albany</HI> last Year, though they had notice that all his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Governments would have Commissioners there with Presents from most Provinces as well as from the <HI>King,</HI> and on all preceding like Occasions there were never less than six or seven hundred. The utmost that could be obtained of them at this Meeting, was an Agreement to stand neuter in our Disputes with the French, for they unanimously declared, that so far from acting against the French they should be obliged to make the best Terms they could with them, in order to preserve themselves and their Country from being destroyed by their powerful Arms. The <HI>English,</HI> they observed, would not fight for them∣selves, and as for them they could not defend their own
<PB N="47" REF="007434_0048_102D867B01D1AED8"/>Country and that of the <HI>English</HI> too. But if they saw the <HI>English</HI> act powerfully, and that their own Country, Wives, and Children were safe while they went forth to War, they then should be glad to meet the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> and the Commissioners again, for it was against their Inclination to treat with the French, but Necessity compelled them. Therefore if some bold Stroke is not soon made to retrieve our lost Reputation and the wonted Confidence and Friendship of this brave and faithful People, who upon all other Occa∣sions have been our best Friends and have it in their Power to be our worst Enemies, so as to act in our Favour and to influence their Allies and Tributaries, who, together with the Five <HI>Nations,</HI> make seventeen thousand Men, to do the same, we shall not only lose the Assistance of the whole <HI>Indian</HI> In∣terest of <HI>North-America,</HI> but have it turned against us. For <HI>Indians,</HI> like more refined and politer Nations, will not join the Weakest, especially when their own Country is in danger from the Strongest in the Field; and it is impossible for their <HI>Sachems</HI> to restrain their young Men, who delight in War more than any thing else, when all their Neighbours are en∣gaged, and the Sound of War echoes from Hill to Hill all around them.</P>
<P>The French have since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> built two Forts on <HI>Beef River,</HI>

In 1751 they built another Fort at <HI>Sandoski</HI> on the South Side of Lake <HI>Erie</HI> in this Province. They have also one Fort upon the River <HI>Illinois,</HI> one at the Confluence of the Rivers <HI>Oubache</HI> and <HI>Ohio,</HI> one at the Junction of the Rivers <HI>Missouri</HI> and <HI>Mississipi,</HI> one higher up the River <HI>Missouri,</HI> and one at the Confluence of the Rivers <HI>Kaskakins</HI> and <HI>Mississipi,</HI> all built in Times of Peace since the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and within this his MAJESTY's Province.</P>
<P>Last Year they marched a Body of regular Troops, Mi∣litia and <HI>Indians</HI> into this Province, and attacked and de∣feated four hundred of his MAJESTY's Forces at the <HI>Great Meadows.</HI> They compelled our Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der in Chief of those four hundred Men to enter into Articles of Capitula∣tion and give Hostages, in as formal a Manner as if War had actually been proclaimed between the two Crowns.

<P>The French have for these two or three Years past set their <HI>Indians</HI> loose upon the Inhabitants of this Province also, and killed, scalped, and captivated many of them, seized some of their Effects, and forced those that were settled without the Mountains, together with some of our friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> to break up their Settlements and retire within the Mountains.

<P>They continued to have, by the last Advices, two thousand two hundred regular Troops and Militia, and six hundred <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors at their Forts in this Province and <HI>Pennsyl∣vania</HI> that are near the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and threatened a further Irrup∣tion, for which they were preparing.</P>

<P>In 1730 they utterly extirpated the whole Tribe (except a few that escaped to the <HI>Chickasaws</HI>) of <HI>Indians</HI> called <HI>Nautchee,</HI> that resided about the Forks of the River <HI>Yasou</HI> which rises in this Province not very far from, and empties itself into, the Mississipi. The French did this when they were in profound Peace with these <HI>Indians</HI> under the Sanction of a formal Treaty; but finding they continued an Inter∣course and Trade with the <HI>English,</HI> they fell upon them in the Night, and massacred Men, Women, and Children, not spar∣ing even those they took alive, but put them to death in the most inhuman and cruel Torments. This Perfidy and
<PB N="50" REF="007434_0051_102D8680B2C4D768"/>Cruelty of the French being communicated to the <HI>Chickasaw Indians</HI> who reside a little to the Northward of the <HI>Nautchees</HI> Country, and they fearing the like Fate, as they were in the strictest Friendship and constantly traded with the <HI>English,</HI> they declared War against the French, and it has not been in the Power of all their own Force and Policy to prevail on them to make Peace to this Day, nor could they ever prevail on any other Indians to join against them, as they are remarkable for Faith and Bravery, as their War is esteemed just and necessary, and as they are highly revered for their Military Atchievements. These <HI>Chickasaws</HI> have been as severe a Scourge to the French Colony of <HI>Louisiani,</HI> as any of their <HI>Indians</HI> have been to any of our Colonies; but their long and constant Hostilities against the French have reduced them to four hundred fighting Men only, who continue the War with as much Spirit and Intrepidity as ever.</P>
<P>The French of <HI>Louisiani</HI> have entirely alienated the <HI>Chauctas</HI> from our Interest, who reside in their Neighbourhood between the <HI>Mobile</HI> and <HI>Mississipi,</HI> and amount to five thousand fight∣ing Men.</P>
<P>And by their Fort at <HI>Alibamous</HI> they have obtained such Influence among the <HI>Upper Creek Indians,</HI> amounting to one thousand two hundred Men, that they would have broke out against <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>Georgia</HI> several times, if it had not been for the Interposition of the <HI>Lower Creeks,</HI> who amount to one thousand three hundred Men, and are our fast Friends.</P>
<P>From this Deduction of French Encroach∣ments it appears that they have drawn a Line,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>have sur∣rounded his Majesty</HI>'s <HI>Colonies with Forts,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and have a Chain of Forts and Settlements, all along the Back of our Settlements from the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> to the Mouths of the Mississipi in the Gulf of <HI>Mexico,</HI> whereby they have accomplished their ancient Design of sur∣rounding the <HI>British Northern Colonies</HI> Settle∣ments, of fortifying themselves on the Back thereof, of taking Possession of the most important Passes of the great Rivers and Lakes, and of drawing off the <HI>Indians</HI> to their Interest, who they have more or less constantly, both in Peace and War,
<PB N="51" REF="007434_0052_102D86846810D600"/>issued from their Forts on our Frontier Settlements, some of which they have destroyed, others they have impeded the Pro∣gress of, and in most of our Provinces prevented the projecting or making new Establishments. For there is nothing more terrible than <HI>Indian</HI> Wars, and whenever they happen the In∣habitants eat their Bread in continual Fear and Trembling; no Man is sure when out of his House of ever returning to it again; while they labour in the Fields they are under terrible Apprehensions of being killed and scalped, or of being seized and carried to the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, there to end their Days in cruel Torments, or be turned over to the French to be re∣deemed at the Price of <HI>Black Slaves.</HI> They are many times obliged to neglect both their Seed Time and Harvest. The Landlord often sees all his Land plundered, his Houses burnt, and the whole Country ruined, while they can't think their Persons safe in their Fortifications. In short, all Trade, Business, and Commerce is at an entire Stand, while Fear, Despair, and Misery appears in the Faces of the poor In∣habitants.</P>
<P>I say, this Conduct of the French is in Consequence of an ancient Design or System, and it certainly is so, for all their Governors and Writers of the Northern Colonies have con∣stantly recommended it to the Court of France, who, we are now fatally convinced, have carried it systematically into Ex∣ecution. And our Colonies have as constantly remonstrated to the Court of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> these Encroachments and De∣predations, and the further terrible Consequences they had the utmost Reason to expect from them. But it is now too late in a great measure, and therefore to little Purpose, to enquire further why we neglected to exert the Power God and Nature put into our Hands to prevent these Evils, or to remove them whenever and wherever they appeared. There∣fore I shall enter into this Enquiry in the Course of these Sheets no further than by pointing out some of the Causes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Majestys <HI>Colonies injuriously charged with Neglects,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> which if removed, the Ef∣fects will cease, and to acquit his MAJESTY'S COLONIES of the cruel Accusation, from Persons of all Ranks almost in this Country,
<PB N="52" REF="007434_0053_102D868644F345E0"/>of having neglected their own Defence, and, by other cri∣minal Conduct, having invited the Calamities they suffer. This has been very industriously propagated by some People, who have found it necessary to blame the Colonies, the bet∣ter to excuse themselves; and by others who have had sup∣port in their Clamours from a late Pamphlet called, a <HI>Brief State of the Province of Pennsylvania,</HI> which I shall say no more of at present than that it is calculated for private Pur∣poses, at the Expence of a very respectable Body of People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to whom this Country is more obliged than most People at present know or can imagine, and who will very soon be acquited, with Honour, of the exceptionable Conduct laid to their Charge. Some People would do well in never losing sight of this, being, of all others, the most im∣proper time to inflame the Passions and alienate the Hearts of even the most remote and insignificant of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Sub∣jects, and of its being the most proper and necessary Measure at this critical Conjuncture to reconcile all jarring Interests, and to please and oblige every Class of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Subjects in every part of his Dominions, that they may act with their Heads, Hearts, Hands, and Purses unanimously for the Re∣covery of his just Rights, and for permanently securing him in the Possession of them.</P>
<P>It is certain not any one of the Colonies are to blame, as will appear when I come to speak of their Conduct, Temper, and Disposition, so it must lay elsewhere.</P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>North-America</HI> are become of the last Importance to his MAJESTY's Nor∣thern Colonies in particular,

However, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has been so long a Sufferer by French Perfidy, and so often deluded by the treacherous Negotiations of that faith∣less Nation, that it cannot be supposed that she will any longer listen to their insidious Proposals, than till we are ready at Home and Abroad to give them a decisive Blow; therefore continuing to negotiate with them, while we are preparing for War, can do us no Injury, but may be very political. Nor can it be supposed that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will suffer herself to be again deceived by entering into a Treaty of Accommoda∣tion with that perfidious Power, but what settles every Point in the Treaty, and does not refer the least Particular to Com∣missaries, that can possibly be disputed, in <HI>Europe, Asia, Af∣rica,</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> and not even this till his <HI>Majesty</HI> is restored to his just Rights and Posses∣sions,

For to come to an Accommodation with them on any other Terms is only purchasing the <HI>Name</HI> of Peace, and giving Being and Support to new Encroach∣ments and a new War. But this the haughty and insolent <HI>Gallic</HI> will never submit to till heartily drubbed into it. And certainly there never was a greater Necessity, nor we cannot expect a more proper Conjuncture for this Nation's entering upon the Work than the present, whether we consider the Nature and Greatness of the Object we are to contend for, or our Ability, compared with theirs, to carry on a War however remote and discontiguous.</P>
<P>This Nation has often entered into War to revenge the Insults and Injures affecting its Merchants and Seamen; and
<PB N="56" REF="007434_0057_102D868FCE7362F8"/>often only to defend <HI>Foreign Princes,</HI> and to support the Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Necessity of going to War with</HI> France.</NOTE> in Consequence of Treaties, when neither its Trade, Navigation, Territories, nor Subjects were affected. But the War that is now just and necessary we should engage in against <HI>France,</HI> is of such a Nature as to demand all our Resentment, arouse all our Cour∣age. Your Provinces are invaded, your Towns are burnt, many of your Plantations destroyed or deserted, your ancient and faithful <HI>Indian</HI> Allies and Subjects cut off from all Com∣munication with you; others of your Fellow Subjects mur∣dered, scalped, captivated, and fold at the Price of <HI>Black Slaves,</HI> and many of the rest in imminent Danger of the like melan∣choly Catastrophe; your fairest and best Revenues endanger'd. And all these Insults, Injuries, and Barbarities committed by the very People we have the <HI>Name</HI> of Peace with. Your Fathers resented every Infringment upon <HI>British</HI> Liberty, and shall the Blood of <HI>British</HI> Subjects, shed in an unjust and cruel Man∣ner, cry for no Vengeance from you?</P>

<PB N="57" REF="007434_0058_102D869195B5FFA8"/>it is from them we have all our <HI>Tobacco, Rice, Rum,</HI> and most of our <HI>Sugars, Dying</HI> and other valuable <HI>Woods, Cotton-Wool, Pimento, Ginger, Indico, Whale and Liver Oil and Whale-Bone, Beaver</HI> and other <HI>Furs,</HI> Deer Skins, and innumerable other Articles, and many of them in such Abundance as not only to be sufficient for our own Consumption, which other∣wise must have been bought of Foreigners at excessive Prices in hard Money as formerly, but a great Excess to export to Foreigners, which increases the Ballance in our Favour with some Countries, and lessens the Ballance against us in others; it is from them our whole <HI>African</HI> Trade receives its Support, which Trade requires vast Quantities of the Produce and Manufactures of this Country, and <HI>East-India</HI> Commodities in return for <HI>Gold-Dust, Ivory, Gums,</HI> and several Sorts of <HI>Dy∣ing Woods</HI> imported into <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> but were it not for the Colonies this could not be done, as the Trade could not be supported was it not for the vast Assistant Profit of <HI>Black Slaves</HI> for <HI>America;</HI> it is from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we shall receive, as has been proved by Experiments, all the <HI>Silk, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Flax, Iron, Pot-Ashes, Wine, Fruit, Olive Oil, Drugs,</HI> and in short all the Commodities we are now dependent upon, and have from Foreigners in the same Parallels of Latitude in <HI>Europe, Barba∣ry,</HI> and <HI>Persia;</HI> it is from them great Part of the Revenue of these Kingdoms is derived; and it is from them great Part of the Wealth we see, that Credit which circulates, and those Payments that are made at the <HI>Bank and the Bankers</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don</HI> results; and they are so linked in with, and dependent upon, the <HI>American</HI> Revenues and Remittances, that if they are ruined and stopt, the whole System of Public Credit in this Country will receive a fatal Shock. But what will your <HI>Landholders, Manufacturers, Artificers, Merchants, &amp;c.</HI> say of the Importance of your Colonies, and the Necessiy of going to War to regain and preserve them entire, if it cannot be done by other Means, when they reflect that if they are lost, they will lose one Third of their Property and Business in general; for it is certain, that full one Third of our whole Export of the Produce and Manufactures of this Country is to our Co∣lonies, and in proportion as this diminishes or increases, their
<PB N="58" REF="007434_0059_102D869324C2D7C8"/>Estates and Business must increase or diminish; for as in the Body Natural a Finger can't ach but the whole feels it, so in the Body Politic the remotest and most insignificant of your Colonies can't decay, but the Nation must suffer with it. Therefore the Mother Country must needs rejoice in the Se∣curity and Prosperity of every one of her Colonies, because it is her own Security and Prosperity; and the Colonies are to her as the Feet are to the Natural Body, the Support of the whole Political Frame. And they have enabled us to make the Figure we do at present, and have done for upwards of a Century past, in the Commercial World, from whence we have derived Wealth, Power and Glory, and the greatest Bles∣sings given Man to know. Consider then, if you ought not to direct the whole of your Counsels and Arms to support a War, wherein, with the Being of your State, you assert the Dignity of your Reputation, the Safety of your Friends, the best Branches of your Revenue, and the Properties of your Fellow Subjects.</P>
<P>Thus much for the Necessity of going to War,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Ability to carry on a War against</HI> France.</NOTE> and the Nature and Greatness of the Object we are to contend for: And now for our Ability to support a War vigorously and effectually.</P>
<P>It is certain that the Excess of the Sinking Fund, arising from the Reduction of the Interest of the National Debt, amounts to 1,300,000<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per Annum</HI> at present, which with the Land Tax raised to four Shillings in the Pound will yield 2,300,000<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per Annum</HI> over and above the ordinary Services of Government. The Proprietors of the National Debt de∣fire no Part of their Capital, but only the Interest; therefore this Sum may be applied to carry on a War, and whatever it falls deficient for the Purpose to 1757, may undoubtedly be bor∣rowed at Three <HI>per Cent. per Annum.</HI> For such a sacred Re∣gard has been paid to public Faith and private Property, on all Occasions, since the Revolution, that Public Credit has gra∣dually extended from that glorious <HI>Epocha</HI> to the present Time, and we were convinced the other Day that it never was so extensive as at present. But in 1757 the Excess of the Sink∣ing
<PB N="59" REF="007434_0060_102D8694EDF4D4E0"/>Fund will be, from the Reduction of Interest, the Salt Duty which will then be redeemed, and the Land Tax at Four Shillings in the Pound, 3,200,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> over and above the ordinary Exigences of Government, which is sufficient to car∣ry on such a War as this Country ought, if possible, to carry on, I mean a Naval War in all Parts of the Globe without borrowing a Shilling. But if it should be found necessary, as it always has been, to divert the Power of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> from being wholly bent against this <HI>Island,</HI> which if it was you would be obliged to keep great Part of your Naval Force at home for your own Defence, and consequently annoy and dis∣tress the Enemy the less abroad, by attacking them in <HI>Europe</HI> on the Continent, and you should want to borrow a Million or two <HI>per Annum:</HI> Such is the flourishing Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Public Credit, and must continue to be, from a Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ex∣traordinary Expence can be but <HI>temporary,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> venue of 2,200,000 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per Annum</HI> to pay off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Peace is <HI>perpetual,</HI> that you can never want it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> however great a Paradox it may appear at first Sig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>untry p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ver was, in point of Finances, so capable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it did not owe a Shilling, as at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 72,000,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> For when was it that we had a standing Re∣venue of 2,200,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> besides the occasional <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the Land Tax raised to four Shillings in the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, and the or∣dinary Services of Government? Or when was Public Credit so extensive for new Loans as at this present Time, tho' to all Appearance we are at the Eye of a War with the most formidable Nation in <HI>Europe?</HI> And has it not often happened in former Times, when the Nation owed little or nothing, and Government was in the greatest Distress for Supplies, that the People could not, or would not, either pay or lend them?</P>
<P>But what a great Aid will this Ability receive if the Oeco∣nomy of our <HI>American</HI> Colonies is put upon a wise and solid Foundation for the mutual Interest of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies? Then they will require neither Troops nor Mo∣ney from this Country for their own Defence, or to drive the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>New World,</HI> or any other Assistance, but that of Men of War and the Maintenance of the regular
<PB N="60" REF="007434_0061_102D8697067054A8"/>Troops that have been ordered there from hence, let the War be ever so long or discontiguous, which will be not only pre∣venting a vast future Expence, but the saving of the whole of the present for all <HI>America,</HI> except the regular Troops and Men of War.</P>
<P>A Fund more than equal to these great and necessary Ser∣vices in <HI>America</HI> may be raised in his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Colonies in such a Manner,</P>
<P>As will free their Trade and Commerce from injudicious and destructive Imposts and Restrictions;</P>
<P>As will put a compleat and final End to all illicit Trade in all our Colonies, whereby <HI>Foreign</HI> Produce and Manufactures, clandestinely introduced, shall be utterly excluded, and <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Produce and Manufactures substituted in lieu of them;</P>
<P>As will highly please and oblige the landed and trading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of <HI>America</HI> in several considerable Branches, and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them in others than any moderate Tax for Self-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is to the bravest and most loyal People?</P>

<P>As will not oppress, plague, and harrass them in the Col∣lection, or be mostly sunk by the Collectors; And,</P>
<P>As will enable Government to apply it in any Part of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> so that the Strongest shall support the Weakest, and the unexposed the exposed, Colony; and all of them shall act in Concert against the Common Enemy, without any of the Risques and Disadvantages of the <HI>Albany</HI> Plan of a Union.</P>
<P>Upon these Principles and with these Views, I shall hum∣bly propose a Plan in my last Chapter that appears to me to be adequate to these importanat Objects; and if it is carried into Execution, or some other that will produce the like Ef∣fects, we need not fear driving the French out of the <HI>New-World,</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="007434_0062_102D90B22D80D590"/>for in our <HI>Northern Colonies</HI> we have upwards of 300,000 effective Men, and the French have not 30,000 in all <HI>New-France</HI> and <HI>Louisiani.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us turn the Tables and look into the Finances of <HI>France;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The State of the</HI> French <HI>Finances.</HI></NOTE> and here we find from Au∣thority that they have anticipated, or sunk, their whole Revenue till 1761, so that the King has not a single Branch but what is mortgaged down to that Year at six or seven <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest, and which even he cannot resume without destroying the whole System of public Credit in his Kingdom. But by renewing some Taxes he took off soon after the late War, and levying the twentieth Penny upon the Clergy, he will be enabled to borrow, at exorbitant Interest, immense Sums till his other Revenues are redeemed. However this must make his People, with the other peculiar Distresses accompanying a War with us, very uneasy; and his Power must be greatly enervated to what it would be if his usual Revenues were unincumbered. And as to his <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies, he can't raise a Shilling in them for their Defence, which with his paying upwards of 1,000,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI> in Subsidies to foreign Princes, gives the best Opportunity we can ever expect, from his Finances, to attack and reduce his dangerous Power.</P>
<P>Our Fleet consists of more than double the Number of Ships and Guns that the French Fleet does.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> British <HI>and</HI> French <HI>Fleets com∣pared.</HI></NOTE> But if the French go on upon the Plain for restoring their Navy, that they have pursued ever since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle,</HI> their Fleet will in 1761 consist of a hundred and twenty Ships of the Line, and it does not exceed sixty-four of that Size now in the Water and building. Therefore nothing but a War can prevent this Branch of their Power from becoming too great for our Controul, and whenever this shall be the Case, adieu to all that is dear and valuable in this Country.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the <HI>Dutch</HI> are sunk lower in the Political World,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">British <HI>and</HI> French <HI>Al∣liances com∣pared.</HI></NOTE> than ever their Country was in the Watery, we have a new and more pow∣erful Ally of our own creating than ever they were by Land, in the <HI>Empress Queen;</HI> to her
<PB N="62" REF="007434_0063_102D71E94117D0D0"/>we are to add the <HI>Empress of Russia,</HI> the <HI>King of Poland,</HI> who is a Subsidiary Ally of ours, the <HI>King Elector of Han∣over,</HI> the <HI>Prince of Hesse,</HI> the <HI>Elector of Bavaria,</HI> who is a Subsidiary Ally of ours also, and the <HI>King of Sardinia.</HI> In op∣position to these, <HI>France</HI> has the <HI>Kings of Sweden, Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Prussia,</HI> to whom the pays annually in Subsidies 725,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Sterling; and the <HI>Elector of Cologne,</HI> who has also a Subsidy from her, who it is more than possible are all the Allies she can depend upon in case of a War with us; for <HI>Spain,</HI> it is almost impossible to imagine will interfere as she can have no Interest in the Quarrel, and it is more essential to her to preserve Peace with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> than all the other Powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> and if she does not meddle, it is highly probable neither <HI>Parma</HI> nor <HI>Naples</HI> will, as those two Courts are greatly supported and influenced by <HI>Spain.</HI> But to admit <HI>Spain</HI> does join <HI>France</HI> and declare against us, her Navy added to that of <HI>France</HI> will then be no more than equal to that of ours in Ships and Guns, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cannot man their Fleet, nor the <HI>French</HI> victual theirs, in time of War, so as to act with full and combined Force at once. Therefore if this should be the Case, we shall have nothing to fear but upon the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> where there can be no other Authority at present than mere Conjecture for what part our Allies, or those of <HI>France,</HI> will act, or how far either Side shall make it the Interest of some of the Powers in alliance to maintain a Neutrality, and others to take the Field. But I believe no Person that knows the Interest and Abilities of the several Allies mentioned, will deny, but that we are now not only more able to divert the Force of <HI>France</HI> from this Island, than in the late War, but that we shall be capable of acting offensively, and perhaps so effectually, as to give us an Opportunity to employ the whole of our Fleet in annoying and distressing the Enemy at Sea in all Parts, and to be able to retain whatever we recover or con∣quer in the <HI>New-World.</HI> But to suppose we and our Allies should be beat and distressed upon the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> it is only giving up some one or other of our Conquests in <HI>America,</HI> and we may whenever we please, or the general State of <HI>Europe</HI> requires it, reconcile jarring Interests and purchase
<PB N="63" REF="007434_0064_102D71EB785E9A60"/>Repose. This was experienced in the late War by the Re∣dition of <HI>Cape-Breton.</HI> And as this was the case by the single Conquest of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> when <HI>France</HI> was in Possession of <HI>Madrass</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> lay at their Mercy, with an infinitely superior Army in the Field to that of the Allies, flushed with a long Course of uninterrupted Victories, what Terms cannot you command for yourselves and your Allies, when you have all their <HI>American</HI> Colonies in your Possession; which, with proper Conduct, and the Blessing of God, that we are the more intitled to expect from the Justice of our Cause, must be the Case in a few Years after War commences?</P>
<P>To these Considerations it may not be mal∣a'propos to add,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Zeal and Unani∣mity of his</HI> Majesty's <HI>Subjects, a further En∣couragement for us to go to War.</HI></NOTE> that his <HI>Majesty</HI> having ever made the Laws of the Land the Rule of his Actions, and exercised the Prerogatives of the Crown with that Mildness, Justice, and Propriety as on all Occasions to make them, what they were by our excellent Constitution of Govern∣ment intended for, a Blessing to the People; and his having employed for a Number of Years that upright, moderate, impartial, prudent and wise Minister, who was lately too suddenly snatched to Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, the Minds of Men have been reconciled, and his Majesty, his Family, and his Government are established in the Hearts and Affections of his Subjects unanimously, which is the strongest and best Basis a Throne can be founded upon. Therefore <HI>France,</HI> nor any other Enemy of his <HI>Majesty,</HI> his Government, and these Kingdoms, cannot have the least Encouragement to hope for a Rebellion in this Country, or the least Countenance and assistance in invading it from a∣mongst ourselves. And a War with <HI>France</HI> must appear so just and necessary to every Man, and our Ability to carry it on so superior to whatever it was at any other time, that it is impossible but the whole People should be unanimous for it, and their whole Thoughts bent upon no other public En∣terprize, but revenging the Wrongs and Indignities imposed
<PB N="64" REF="007434_0065_102D71F55CC39DF0"/>upon us by <HI>France.</HI> And this they have given an Earnest of, by the unparallelled Spirit and vigorous Assistance all Ranks, in all Parts, have exhibited on the Prospect of a War.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, such is the State of our Affairs in every part of his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Dominions, the State of <HI>France,</HI> and the general State of <HI>Europe,</HI> that we never can expect such another favourable Coincidence of such a Variety of Con∣siderations for entering into a War with <HI>France,</HI> to maintain our Honour and Influence, our Colonies, our Commerce and Riches, indeed our Lives and Liberties. And it is absurd to suppose we shall ever be stronger for a War, in Proportion to the growing Power of <HI>France,</HI> than we are now.</P>
