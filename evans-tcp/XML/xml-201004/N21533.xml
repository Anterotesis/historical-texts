<HEAD>SERMON I. ON THE <HI>CAUSES</HI> OF <HI>MEN'S</HI> BEING WEARY OF <HI>LIFE.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB X. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>My soul is weary of my life.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JOB, in the first part of his days, was <HI>the greatest of all the men of the East.</HI> His possessions were large, his family was numerous and flourishing; his own character was fair and blameless. Yet this man it pleased God to visit with extraordinary rever∣ses of fortune. He was robbed of his whole sub∣stance. His sons and his daughters all peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed; and he himself, fallen from his high estate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hild∣less and reduced to poverty, was smitten with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore disease. His friends came about him, seemingly with the purpose of administering comfort. But from a harsh and ill-founded construction of the in∣tention of Providence in his disasters, they only added to his sorrows by unjust upbraiding. Hence those many pathetic lamentations with which this book abounds, poured forth in the most beautiful and touching strain of Oriental poetry. In one of those hours of lamentation, the sentiment in the text was uttered; <HI>My soul is weary of my life;</HI> a
<PB N="2" REF="028306_0007_0FD894D73ADB1BB0"/>sentiment, which surely, if any situation can justify it, was allowable in the case of Job.</P>
<P>In situations very different from that of Job, un∣der calamities far less severe, it is not uncommon to find such a sentiment working in the heart, and sometimes breaking forth from the lips of men. Many, very many there are, who on one occasion or other, have experienced this weariness of life, and been tempted to wish that it would come to a close. Let us now examine in what circumstances this feeling may be deemed excusable; in what it is to be held sinful; and under what restrictions we may, on any occasion, be permitted to say, <HI>My soul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P>I shall consider the words of the text in three lights; as expressing, <HI>First,</HI> The sentiment of a discontented man; <HI>Secondly,</HI> The sentiment of an afflicted man; <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The sentiment of a devout man.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let us consider the text as expressing the sen∣timent of a discontented man; with whom it is the effusion of spleen, vexation, and dissatisfaction with life, arising from causes neither laudable nor justifi∣able. There are chiefly three classes of men who are liable to this disease of the mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the idle; the luxurious; the criminal.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> This weariness of life is often found among the idle; persons commonly in easy circumstances of fortune, who are not engaged in any of the labo∣rious occupations of the world, and who are, at the same time, without energy of mind to call them forth into any other line of active exertion. In this languid, or rather torpid state, they have so many vacant hours, and are so much at a loss how to fill up their time, that their spirits utterly sink; they become burdensome to themselves, and to every one
<PB N="3" REF="028306_0008_0FD894D97A9F3B90"/>around them; and drag with pain the load of exist∣ence. What a convincing proof is hereby afforded, that man was designed by his Creator to be an active being, whose happiness is to be found not merely in rest, but in occupation and pursuit? The idle are doomed to suffer the natural punishment of their inactivity and folly; and for their complaints of the tiresomeness of life there is no remedy but to awake from the dream of sloth, and to fill up with proper employment the miserable vacancies of their days. Let them study to become useful to the world, and they shall soon become less burdensome to them∣selves. They shall begin to enjoy existence; they shall reap the rewards which Providence has annexed to virtuous activity; and have no more cause to say <HI>My soul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> The luxurious and the dissipated form ano∣ther class of men, among whom such complaints are still more frequent. With them they are not the fruit of idleness. These are men who have been busied enough; they have run the whole race of pleasure; but they have run it with such inconsider∣ate speed, that it terminates in weariness and vex∣ation of spirit. By the perpetual course of dissipa∣tion in which they are engaged; by the excesses which they indulge; by the riotous revel, and the midnight or rather morning hours to which they prolong their sectivity; they have debilitated their bodies, and worn out their spirits. Satiated with the repetition of their accustomed pleasures, and yet unable to find any new ones in their place; wander∣ing round and round their former haunts of joy, and ever returning disappointed; weary of themselves, and of all things about them, their spirits are op∣pressed with a deadly gloom, and the complaint bursts forth of odious life and a miserable world. Never
<PB N="4" REF="028306_0009_0FD894DB5A7E1EA8"/>are these complaints more irequent than at the close of rounds of amusement, and after a long repetition of festal pleasures; when the spirits which had been forced up, as by some intoxicating drug, to an un∣natural height, subside into profound dejection. What increases the evil is, that it is not among the infirm and the aged, but among the young, the gay, and the prosperous, who ought to be reputed the happiest men, that this distaste of life most frequent∣ly prevails.</P>
<P>When persons of this description, in their peevish and splenetic hours, exclaim, <HI>My soul is weary of my life,</HI> let them know, let them be assured, that this is no other than the judgment of God overtaking them for their vices and follies. Their complaints of mis∣ery are entitled to no compassion; nay, they are sin∣ful, because they arise from a sinful cause; from a mind broken and debased by luxury and corruption. They are the authors of their own misery, by having thrown away on the follies of the world those pow∣ers which God had bestowed on them for nobler ends.—Let them return to the duties of men and Christians. Let them retreat from frivolity, and abstain from excess. Let them study temper∣ance, moderation, and self-command. By enter∣ing on a virtuous and manly course of action, and applying to the honourable discharge of the sunctions of their station, they will acquire different views. They will obtain more real enjoyment of life, and become more willing to prolong it.—But, after the warnings which God has given them of their misbehaviour by the inward misery they suffer, if they still continue to run the same intemperate round, and to drain pleasure to the last dregs, it shall come to pass, that they who now contemn life, and are impatient of its continuance, shall be the persons
<PB N="5" REF="028306_0010_0FD894DC81031050"/>most eager to prolong it. When they behold it in reality drawing towards a close, and are obliged to look forward to what is to come after it, they shall be rendered awfully sensible of its value. They will then grasp eagerly at the flying hours; anxious to stop them if they could, and to employ every mo∣ment that remains in repairing their past errors, and in making their peace, if possible, with God and heaven. According as <HI>they have sown,</HI> they now <HI>reap.</HI> They are reduced <HI>to eat the fruit of their own ways, and to be filled with their own devices.</HI></P>
<P>There remains still a third class of those who from discontent are become weary of life; such as have embittered it to themselves by the conscious∣ness of criminal deeds. They have been, perhaps, unnatural to their parents, or treacherous to their friends; they have violated their fidelity; have en∣snared and ruined the innocent; or have occasioned the death of others. There is no wonder that such persons should lose their relish for life. To what∣ever arts they may have recourse for procuring a de∣ceitful peace, conscience will at times exert its native power, and shake over them its terrific, scourge. The internal misery they endure has sometimes arisen to such a height, as has made them terminate, with their own hands, an existence which they felt to be insupportable.—To the complaints of such persons no remedy can be furnished, except what ari∣ses from the bitterness of sincere and deep repentance. We can do no more than exhort them to atone as much as is in their power for the evils they have committed; and to fly to the divine mercy through Jesus Christ for pardon and forgiveness. Let us now,</P>
<P N="2">II. Turn to persons of another description, and consider the sentiment in the text as extorted by situ∣ations
<PB N="6" REF="028306_0011_0FD894DE3888EA68"/>of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss. These are so variously multiplied in the world, and often so oppressive and heavy, that assuredly it is not uncommon to hear the afflicted complain that they are weary of life. Their com∣plaints, if not always allowable, yet certainly are more excusable than those which flow from the sources of dissatisfaction already mentioned. They are sufferers, not so much through their own miscon∣duct, as through the appointment of Providence; and therefore to persons in this situation it may seem more needful to offer consolation, than to give admo∣nition. However, as the evils which produce this impatience of life are of different sorts, a distinction must be made as to the situations which can most excuse it.</P>
<P>Sometimes, the exclamation in the text may be oc∣casioned by deep overwhelming grief. When they whom we had most affectionately loved, and in whom we had placed the felicity of our days, are taken away, our connection with life appears to be dissolved. <Q>Why should we survive those to whom our souls were tied? Would to God we had died before them? Now when they are gone all pleasure and hope is gone as to us. To us the sun no longer shines with his usual brightness. No longer cheerfulness invests the face of nature. On every object a sad gloom appears to rest; and every employment of life is become an oppressive burden.</Q> With the feelings of those who are thus distressed we naturally sympathise. They are frequently the feelings of the most virtuous and amiable minds: And yet such per∣sons must be told, that grief may be endulged so far as to become immoderate and improper. There are bounds which are prescribed to it both by reason and by religion. A Christian ought not to <HI>mourn like those who have no hope.</HI> While he feels his sorrows as a man,
<PB N="7" REF="028306_0012_0FD894DF95914D20"/>he should also study to bear them like a man, with fortitude; and not abandon himself to feeble and fruitless melancholy. Let him have recourse to a stren∣uous discharge of the duties of his station, and con∣sider it as incumbent on him to make the best improve∣ment that he can of those comforts which Providence has still left in his possession.</P>
<P>Again; it sometimes happens that, apart from grief, great reverses of worldly fortune give rise to the lamentation in the text. This was the case with Job himself. A sudden fall from opulence into in∣digence and want; some undeserved disgrace incur∣red, or some unexpected cloud thrown over former reputation and fame; the unkindness and desertion of friends, or the insolent triumph of enemies, are apt to overwhelm the minds of men with gloom, and to reduce them to be weary of life. To persons under such calamities, sympathy is due. That sympathy, however, will be proportioned to the degree in which we consider them as free from blame in the misfortunes which they suffer. As far as, through their own misconduct and vice, they have been the authors to themselves of those misfortunes, we withdraw our pity. The burthen which they have brought on themselves we leave them to bear as they can; and with little concern we hear them ex∣claim that their <HI>souls are weary of life.</HI>—Not only so, but even in cases where calamities have fallen on the innocent, to the pity which we feel for them will be joined a secret contempt, if we perceive that together with their prosperity, their courage and fortitude have also forsaken them. To abandon themselves to de∣jection carries no mark of a great or a worthy mind. Instead of declaring that his <HI>soul is weary of his life,</HI> it becomes a brave and a good man, in the evil day, with firmness to maintain his post; to bear up against
<PB N="8" REF="028306_0013_0FD894E0FB70FAE0"/>the storm; to have recourse to those advantages which in the worst of times, are always left to integrity and virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may yet arise.</P>
<P>It is good for persons in such situations to remark that, though Job was for a long while severely tried by a variety of distresses, yet his condition was not left finally unhappy. On the contrary, the goodness of that God whom he had served returned at last, to shine upon him with greater brightness than ever. His riches were restored to him twofold. The losses in his family were repaired by a new offspring. His name became again renowned in the East; and <HI>the latter end of Job,</HI> we are told, <HI>was more blessed than the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>But still, it may be asked, will not the continuance of long and severe disease justify the exclamation in the text, <HI>My soul is weary of my life!</HI> To persons who are forsaken by all the blessings of health, and who have no prospect left, but that of lingering under sickness or pain, Job's complaint may assuredly be forgiven more than to any others. Though it might be suggested to them, that even in old age and sick∣ness, except in very extreme cases, some resources are always left, of which they may avail themselves for relief; yet it must be admitted, that lawfully they may wish their sufferings to be brought to an end. Still however they must remember, that resignation to the pleasure of heaven continues to be their duty to the last. As long as any part remains to be acted, as long as their continuance in the world can serve any valuable purpose; it is more honourable to bear the load with magnanimity, than to give way to a querulous and dejected spirit. It remains,</P>
<P N="3">III. To address myself to another order of men, among whom, though more rarely than among those
<PB N="9" REF="028306_0014_0FD894E33A89E6A0"/>whom I have described, the sentiment of the text is to be found. They are persons who have no parti∣cular complaint to make of the injustice of the world, or the afflictions of their state. But they are tired of the vanity of the world, of its insipid en∣joyments, and its perpetually revolving circle of tifles and follies. They feel themselves made for something greater and nobler. They are disgusted and hurt with the scenes of wickedness that are often passing before their eyes. Their hearts are warmed with the thoughts of a purer and more perfect exist∣ence designed for man; and in the moments of as∣piration after it, the exclamation breaks forth, <HI>My soul is weary of my life.—O that I had wings like a dove! for then I would fly away and be at rest. Lo then I would wander far off, and remain in the wilder∣ness. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. For I have seen violence and strife in the city. Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lv. 6, 11.</NOTE>—In this view the sentiment in the text may sometimes be that of a devout man. But such persons I must admonish, that their devotion, how sincere however, is not al∣together of a rational and chastened kind. It was from this temper that, in former ages of the church, the numerous race sprung of anchorets, hermits, and all the various orders who voluntarily abandoned the the world, to people the lonely desarts and the mo∣nastic retreat. The ordinary course of things seem∣ed below them as candidates for heaven. The con∣cerns of the world appeared unworthy of their at∣tention, and dangerous to their virtue. Breathing after a higher estate, they imagined that they could not abstract themselves too much from every earthly
<PB N="10" REF="028306_0015_0FD894E4C0801510"/>amusement, as long as they were forced to remain in this place of exile.</P>
<P>Let us beware of all such imaginary refinements as produce a total disrelish of our present condition. They are, for the most part, grafted either on dis∣appointed pursuits, or on a melancholy and splenetic cast of mind. They are far from contributing to hap∣piness, and are inconsistent with all the active virtues of man. This life deserves not indeed to be put in competition with that blessed immortality to which God has raised our hopes. But such as it is, it is the gift of God. It is the sphere in which his wisdom has placed us, and appointed us to act our parts. As long as it lasts, we must neither slight the duties which it requires, nor undervalue the innocent en∣joyments which it offers. It belongs to a man to live among men as his brethren; which he who de∣clares himself weary of life is not qualified to do with propriety.</P>
<P>Thus I have placed before you, in various views, the sentiment in the text; and have shewn in what circumstances, and from what causes, that disrelish of life arises which is often found among mankind. On a review of the whole, we cannot but acknow∣ledge, that it is oftener to be ascribed to our own vices and follies, than to any other cause. Among the mul∣titudes in the world, to whom at this day, life is bur∣densome, the far greater number is of those who have rendered it so to themselves. Their idleness, their luxury and pleasures, their criminal deeds, their im∣moderate passions, their timidity and baseness of mind have dejected them in such a degree, as to make them weary of their existence. Preyed upon by discontent of their own creating, they complain of life when they ought to reprehend themselves.</P>
<P>Various afflictions there doubtless are in the world;
<PB N="11" REF="028306_0016_0FD894E64690A618"/>many persons with whom we have cause to sympa∣thise, and whom we might reasonably forgive for wishing death to close their sorrows. But of the evils which embitter life, it must be admitted, that the greater part is such as we have brought on our∣selves; or at least such as, if we were not wanting to ourselves, might be tolerably supported. When we compute the numbers of those who are disposed to say, <HI>My soul is weary of my life,</HI> some there are to whom this sentiment is excusable; but many more among whom it is in no way justifiable. I admit that, among the worthiest and the best, there may be dark moments in which some feeling of this nature may be apt to intrude upon their minds. But with them they are only moments of occasional and passing gloom. They soon recall the vigour of their minds; and return with satisfaction to the discharge of the duties, and to a participation of the enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>One great cause of men's becoming weary of life is grounded on the mistaken views of it which they have formed, and false hopes which they have enter∣tained from it. They have expected a scene of en∣joyment; and when they meet with disappointments and distresses, they complain of life, as if it had cheated and betrayed them. God ordained no such possession for man on earth as continued pleasure. For the wisest purposes he desgined our state to be chequered with pleasure and pain. As such let us receive it, and make the best of what is doomed to be our lot. Let us remain persuaded, that simple and moderate pleasures are always the best; that vir∣tue and a good conscience are the sures foundations of enjoyment; that he who serves his God and his Saviour with the purest intentions, and governs his passions with the greatest care, is likely to lead the
<PB N="12" REF="028306_0017_0FD894E7BADE9E20"/>happiest life. Following these principles, we shall meet with fewer occasions of being weary of life; we shall always find some satisfactions mixed with its crosses; and shall be enabled to wait with a hum∣ble and contented mind till the Almighty, in his ap∣pointed time, finish our state of trial, and remove us to a more blessed abode.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON II. ON <HI>CHARITY</HI> AS THE END OF THE <HI>COMMANDMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 TIMOTHY i. 5.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from this chapter, that one design of the Apostle, in writing to Timothy, was to guard him against certain corrupters of Christian doctrine, who had already arisen in the church. To their false representations of religion he opposes that gen∣eral view of it which is given in the text. Such summaries of religion frequently occur in the sacred writings; and are extremely useful. By the com∣prehensive energy with which they express the great lines of our duty, they both imprint them on our memory, and bring them home to our conscience with force. In the progress of this discourse, I hope
<PB N="13" REF="028306_0018_0FD894E958338A98"/>to make it appear, that the words of the text afford a most enlarged and instructive view of religion in all its chief parts.</P>
<P>The Apostle pronounces charity to be <HI>the end</HI> or scope <HI>of the commandment,</HI> that is, of the law of God. At the same time, in order to prevent mistakes on this most important subject, he subjoins to charity certain adjuncts, as necessary to qualify it, and to render the Christian character complete. These are the <HI>pure heart,</HI> the <HI>good conscience,</HI> and <HI>faith unfeign∣ed.</HI> In treating of these, I shall shew the nature of their connection with charity, and the importance of their being always united with it.</P>
<P><HI>The end of the commandment is charity.</HI> Charity is the same with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed, in the New Testament, to de∣note all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It consists not in speculative ideas of general benevolence floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as speculations too often do, un∣touched and cold. Neither is it confined to that in∣dolent good nature, which makes us rest satisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of ser∣vice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a single virtue; but a disposition resi∣ding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forbearance, generosity, com∣passion, and liberality, flow, as so many native streams. From general good-will to all, it extends its influence particularly to those with whom we stand in nearest connection, and who are directly within the sphere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it descends to the smaller associations of neighbourhood, relations, and friends; and spreads itself over the whole circle of
<PB N="14" REF="028306_0019_0FD894EAC25F0E40"/>social and domestic life. I mean not that it imports a promiscuous undistinguishing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love. Charity, if we should endeavour to carry it so far, would be ren∣dered an impracticable virtue, and would resolve it∣self into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to shut our eyes to the dis∣tinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to those who befriend and those who in∣jure us. It reserves our esteem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it inspires forgiveness and humanity. It breathes uni∣versal candour, and liberality of sentiment. It forms gentleness of temper, and dictates affability of man∣ners. It prompts corresponding sympathies with them who rejoice and them who weep. It teaches us to slight and despise no man. Charity is the com∣forter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppressed, the reconciler of differences, the intercessor for of∣fenders. It is faithfulness in the friend, public spir∣it in the magistrate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the sovereign, and loyalty in the sub∣ject. In parents it is care and attention; in children it is reverence and submission. In a word, it is the soul of social life, it is the sun that enlivens and cheers the abodes of men. It is <HI>like the dew of Her∣mon,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>and the dew that descendeth on the mountains of Zion where the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such charity, says the text, is <HI>the end of the com∣mandment.</HI> This assertion of the Apostle is undoubt∣edly consonant to all that reason can suggest on the subject of religion. For, on considering the nature of the Supreme Being, reason gives us much ground
<PB N="15" REF="028306_0020_0FD894EC3A7DFFC0"/>to believe, that the chief design of all the command∣ments which he has given to men, is to promote their happiness. Independent and self-sufficient, that Su∣preme Being has nothing to exact from us for his own interest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> felicity. By our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervices he cannot be ben∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, nor by our offences injured. When he creat∣ed the world, it was benevolence that moved him to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ser <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ence. When he made himself known to his creatures, benevolence in like manner moved him to give them laws for their conduct. Benevo∣lence is the spring of legislation in the Deity, as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch as it was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tive of creation. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssued his commands on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th on purpose that by obedience to them, his creatures might be rendered happy among themselves in this life, and be prepared for greater hap∣piness in another. Charity, especially when joined with purity, good conscience, and faith, is obviously the great instrument for this purpose; and therefore must needs possess the chief and primary place in the laws of God.</P>
<P>Accordingly, throughout the New Testament, it is uniform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y presented to us to the same light in which it is placed by the text. This is known to all who have any acquaintance with the sacred books. Char∣ity is termed <HI>the fulfilling of the law,</HI> and <HI>the bond of perfectness.</HI> It was assumed by our blessed Lord as the characteristical distinction of his disciples; and in that magni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icent eulogium which the Apostle Paul pronounces upon it, in the thirteenth chapter of the first epi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle to the Corinthians, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pressly prefer∣red by him to <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope.</HI> This de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rves to be se∣riously considered by those who are apt to undervalue charity, as an appendage of what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntemptu∣ously call Morality; while they confine tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e religion to some favourite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ts and observances of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir own, which they considered as comprehending the sum of
<PB N="16" REF="028306_0021_0FD894EDC9B3FA70"/>what is acceptable to God. Such persons show them∣selves profoundly ignorant of the nature of religion, and may too often be suspected of being strangers to its influence. For, as the apostle John reasons, <HI>He that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love that God whom he hath not seen?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iv 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the same time, while I ascribe to charity that high place in the system of religion, which justly be∣longs to it, I am not to be understood as confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing all religion to this disposition alone. With much wis∣dom and propriety, the text hath annexed to it cer∣tain adjuncts, without which neither the character of a good man can be completed, nor charity itself ex∣ercised to advantage. To the consideration of these I now proceed; and I enter the more readily on this branch of the subject, as there is ground to believe, that many pretend to possess charity, without proper∣ly understanding its nature and efficacy. There has been always an unhappy tendency among men to run to extremes, on one side or other, in matters of reli∣gion, as one set of men, who employ all their zeal on right belief, are prone to undervalue good practice; so another set who wish to be esteemed, rational chris∣tians, are inclined to rest the whole of their duty on charitable deeds, while they overlook certain dispo∣sitions and habits which ought always to accompany them. It is therefore of importance, that the mis∣takes of both these classes of men should be rectified, in order that religion may be held forth to the world in its complete form, and in its full and undiminish∣ed lustre.</P>
<P>The first qualification of charity pointed out in the text is purity; <HI>charity out of a pure heart.</HI> Purity in∣cludes the virtues which belong to the individual,
<PB N="17" REF="028306_0022_0FD894EF41382A10"/>considered in himself, and with respect to the govern∣ment of his desires and pleasures. It hath its seat in the heart; but extends its influence over so much of the outward conduct, as to form a great and ma∣terial part of the character. They are only the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> we are told by our Saviour, <HI>who can see God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 8</NOTE> It is also true, that they are only the <HI>pure in heart</HI> who can properly discharge their duties towards mankind. Inordinate love of pleasure, intemper∣ance, sensuality, and a course of irregular life, are inconsistent, not only with the general character of a good man, but also with the peculiar exercises of charity and benevolence. For nothing is more cer∣tain, than that habits of licentious indulgence contri∣bute to stiffle all the good affections; to harden the heart; to nourish that selfish attachment to our own vitious pleasures which renders us insensible to the circumstances and wants of others. A profligate man is seldom found to be a good husband, a good father, or a beneficent neighbour. How many young persons have at first set out in the world with excellent dispo∣sitions of heart; generous, charitable, and humane; kind to their friends, and amiable among all with whom they had intercourse? and yet how often have we seen all those fair appearances unhappily blasted in the progress of life, merely through the influence of loose and currupting pleasures; and those very persons who promised once to be blessings to the world, sunk down, in the end, to be the burthen and nuisance of society? The profusion of expence which their plea∣sures occasion, accounts in a great measure for the fatal reverse that takes place in their character. It not only drains the sources whence the streams of beneficence should flow, but often obliges them to
<PB N="18" REF="028306_0023_0FD894F0C667D4E0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>me oppressive and cruel to those whom it was their duty to have patronised and supported.</P>
<P>Purity of heart and conduct must therefore be held fundamental to charity and love, as well as to gen∣eral piety and virtue. The licentious I know are ready to imagine, that their occasional deeds of boun∣ty and liberality will atone for many of their private disorders. But, besides that such plans of compenia∣tion for vices, by some supposed virtues, are always fallacious, the licentious may be assured, that it is an appearance only of charity, not the reality of it, to which they can lay claim. For that great virtue consists not in occasional actions of humanity, in fits of kindness or compassion, to which bad men may be prompted by natural instinct; but in the steady and regular exercise of those good affections, and the discharge of those important duties towards others, for which the licentious are in a great measure dis∣qualified. Their criminal propensities direct their inclinations to very different objects and pursuits; and often determine them to sacrifice the just rights of others, sometimes to sacrifice the peace and the re∣putation of the innocent, to the gratification of their passions. Such is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pernicious influence which the love of pleasure has on the good qualities of its devot∣ed votaries. The impure heart is like the stagnant and putrifying lake, which sends forth its poisonous exhalations to corrupt and wither every plant that grows on its banks.</P>
<P>The second qualification annexed to Charity, in the text, is, that it be <HI>of a good conscience</HI> By this I understand the Apostle to mean, that charity be in full consistency with justice and integrity; that the <HI>conscience</HI> of the man who purposes to perform ac∣tions of benevolence, be free from the reproach of hav∣ing neglected the primary duties of equity. For,
<PB N="19" REF="028306_0024_0FD894F23A745718"/>undoubtedly, justice is a virtue primary to charity; that is, it must go before it in all its exertions, One must first <HI>do justly</HI> before he can pretend that he <HI>loves mercy.</HI>—Religion, my friends, in order to render it useful to mankind, must be brought down by its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each∣ers from the sublimity of speculation to the functions and occupations of ordinary life. It is my duty to admonish you, that you must, in the first place, be fair in all your dealings with others; you must dis∣charge the debts you owe; you must pay the wages due to your servants and dependents; you must provide for your own family, and be just to the claims of re∣lations; then, and then only, you can, <HI>from a good con∣science,</HI> as the text enjoins, perform acts of generosity and mercy.</P>
<P>This leads to a reflection which here deserves our attention; that, in order to fulfil that <HI>charity which is the end of the commandment,</HI> oeconomy, and good order in private life, ought to be carefully studied by all Christians. This is more closely connected with <HI>a good conscience,</HI> than many seem inclined to admit. Oeconomy, when prudently and temperately con∣ducted, is the safeguard of many virtues; and is in a particular manner favourable to the exertions of benevolence. He who by inconsiderate conduct is injuring his circumstances, will probably in time lose the inclination, and certainly is depriving him∣self o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the means, of being serviceable to his brethren. Some important exertions, indeed, there are of charity, which have no connection with giving or bestowing. Candour, forgiveness, gentleness, and sympathy, are due to our brethren at all times, and in every situation of our own fortune. The poor have opportunities for displaying these virtues, as well as the rich. They who have nothing to give can often afford relief to others, by imparting what they feel. But, as far as beneficence is included in
<PB N="20" REF="028306_0025_0FD894F3C0DBE4F8"/>charity, we ought always to remember, that justice must, in the first place, inviolably be held sacred.</P>
<P>The wisdom of scripture remarkably appears, in the connection pointed out by the text between <HI>cha∣rity</HI> and <HI>good conscience</HI> or integrity; a connection which I apprehend is often not attended to so much as it deserves. Among the frugal and industrious, great regard is commonly paid to justice. They will not defraud. They will not take any unlawful advantage in their dealings: And satisfied with this degree of <HI>good conscience,</HI> they are strangers to that cha∣rity, which is the <HI>end of the commandment.</HI> They are hard and unfeeling. They are rigid and severe in their demands. They know nothing of humanity, forgiveness, or compassion.—Among another class of men, who have been more liberally educated, and who are generally of a higher rank in life, justice is apt to be considered as a virtue less noble than chari∣ty; and which may, on some occasions be dispensed with. They are humane perhaps, and tender in their feelings. They are easy to their dependents. They can be liberal, even to profusion. While, at the same time, they are accumulating debts, which they know themselves unable to discharge. Their affairs are al∣lowed to run into confusion. Oeconomy and good order are neglected. The innocent, in great num∣bers, suffer materially through their mismanage∣ment: And all the while they assume to themselves the praise of being generous and good-hearted men. This surely is not that <HI>charity</HI> which the Gospel en∣joins; and which, in its very essence, involves <HI>good conscience</HI> and integrity. He who pretends to do good to his brethren, without first doing them justice, cannot be accounted their real friend. True charity is not a meteor, which, occasionally glares; but a luminary, which, in its orderly and regular course, dispenses a benignant influence.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028306_0026_0FD894F5402C3468"/>
The third and last adjunct connected in the text with charity is, that it be <HI>of faith unfeigned</HI> Faith in the scripture sense of it, includes the whole of re∣ligious principles respecting God, and respecting Christ. Good principles, without good practice, I confess, are nothing; they are of no avail in the sight of God, nor in the estimation of wise men, But practice not founded on principle is likely to be al∣ways unstable and wavering; and, therefore, the faith of religious principles enters, for a very consi∣derable share, into the proper discharge of the duties of charity.</P>
<P>It will be admitted that, without faith, our duties towards God cannot be properely performed. You may be assured that your duties towards men will al∣ways greatly suffer from the want of it. Faith, when pure and genuine, supplies to every part of virtue and in particular to the virtue of charity, many motives and assistances, of which the unbeliever is destitute. He who acts from faith acts upon the high principle of regard to the God who hath made him, and to the Saviour who redeems him; which will often stimu∣late him to his duty when other principles of benevo∣lence become faint and languid, or are crossed by op∣posite interests. When he considers himself as pur∣suing the approbation of that divine Being, from whom love descends, a sacred enthusiasm both prompts, and consecrates, his charitable dispositions. Regardless of men, or of human recompence, he is carried along by a higher impulse. He acts with the spirit of a follower of the Son of God, who not only has enjoined love, but has enforced it by the example of laying down his life for mankind. Whatever he does in behalf of his fellow-creatures, he considers himself as doing, in some degree, to that divine Per∣son, who hath said, <HI>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
<PB N="22" REF="028306_0027_0FD894F6BAE1B718"/>one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth xxv. 40.</NOTE> Hence charity is with him not only a moral virtue, but a Christian grace. It acquires addition∣al dignity and energy from being connected with the heavenly state and the heavenly inhabitants He mingles with beings of a higher order, while he is discharging his duty to his fellow creatures on earth; and by joining faith and piety to good works he com∣pletes the character of a Christian.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to explain the full sense of that comprehensive view of religion which is giv∣en in the text. I have shown in what respects <HI>char∣ity</HI> joined with <HI>the pure heart, the good conscience, and faith unfeigned</HI> forms <HI>the end of the commandment.</HI> Let us ever keep in view those essential parts of a virtu∣ous character, and preserve them in their proper uni∣on. Thus shall our religion rise into a regular and well-proportioned edifice, where each part gives firmness and support to another. If any one of those material parts be wanting in the structure; if, our system of charity, either purity, or justice, or faith, be left, there will be cracks and slaws in the building which prepare its ruin.</P>
<P>This is indeed one of the greatest and most frequent errors of men, in their moral conduct. They take hold of virtue by pieces and corners only. Few are so depraved as to be without all sense of duty, and all regard to it. To some moral qualities, which appear to them amiable or estimable, almost all men lay claim; and on these they rest their worth, in their own estimation. But these scattered pieces of virtue, not uniting into one whole, nor forming a consistent character, have no powerful influence on their general habits of life. From various unguard∣ed
<PB N="23" REF="028306_0028_0FD894F9C0FDEBE8"/>quarters they lie open to temptation. Their lives are full of contradiction, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perpetually fluctuate between good and evil. Virtue can neither rise to its native dignity nor attain its proper rewards, until all its chief parts be joined together in our character, and exert an equal authority in regulating our con∣duct.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM xxxi. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>My times are in thy hand.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE sun that rolls over our heads, the food that we receive, the rest that we enjoy, daily admon∣ish us of a superior power, on whom the inhabitants of the earth depend for light, life, and subsistence. But as long as all things proceed in their ordinary course; when day returns after day with perfect sim∣ilarity; when our life seems stationary, and nothing occurs to warn us of any approaching change, the religious sentiments of dependence are apt to be for∣gotten. The great revolutions of time, when they come round in their stated order, have a tendency to
<PB N="24" REF="028306_0029_0FD894FB49F7AE78"/>force some impressions of piety even on the most un∣thinking minds. They both mark our existence on earth to be advancing towards its close, and exhibit our condition as continually changing; while each returning year brings along with it new events and at the same time carries us forwards to the conclusion of all. We cannot, on such occasions avoid perceiv∣ing that there is a Supreme Being who holds in his hands the line of our existence, and measures out to each of us our allotted portion of that line. Beyond a certain limit, we know that it cannot be extended; and long before it reach that limit it may be cut asunder by an invisible hand, which is stretched forth over all the inhabitants of the world. Then natur∣ally arises the ejaculation of the text, <HI>My times. O God, are in thy hand.</HI><Q>My fate depends on thee. The duration of my life, and all the events which in future days are to fill it, are entirely at thy dis∣posal.</Q>—Let us now, when we have just seen one year close, and another begin, mediate seriously on this sentiment. Let us consider what is implied in <HI>our times being in the hand of God;</HI> and to what im∣provement this meditation leads.</P>
<P>The text evidently implies, first, that <HI>our times</HI> are not in our own hands; that, as our continuance in life depends not on ourselves, so the events which are to happen, while life remains, are unknown to us, and not under our own direction. Of this we may behold many a proof, when we look back on the transactions of the year which is just finished. Recollection will readily present to us a busy period, filled up with a mixture of business and amusement, of anxteties and cares, of joys and sorrows. We have talked, perhaps and acted much. We have formed many a plan; in public or in private life, we have been engaged in a variety of pursuits. Let me
<PB N="25" REF="028306_0030_0FD894FCC79FF338"/>now ask, how small a proportion of all that has hap∣pened could have been foreseen, or foretold by us? How many things have occured, of which we had no expectation; some, perhaps, that have succeeded be∣yond our hopes; many, also, that have befallen us contrary to our wish? How often were each of us ad∣monished that there are secret wheels, which, unseen by us, bring about the revolutions of human affairs; and that, while man was devising his way, Provi∣dence was directing the event?</P>
<P>That scene is now closed. The tale of that year has been told. We look forward to the year which is beginning; and what do we behold there?—All, my brethren is a blank to our view: A dark un∣known presents itself. We are entering on an untri∣ed, undiscovered country, where, as each succeeding month comes forward, new scenes may open; new objects may engage our attention; changes at home or abroad, in public or private affairs, may alter the whole state of our fortune. New connections may be at hand to be formed, or old ones just about to be dissolved; perhaps, we may have little more to do with this world, or with any of its connections; we may be standing on the verge of time and life, and on the point of passing into a new region of existence. In short the prospect before us is full of awful uncer∣tainty. Life and death, prosperity and adversity, health and sickness, joy and trouble, lie in one un∣distinguishable mass, where our eye can descry no∣thing through the obscurity that wraps them up.</P>
<P>While it is thus certain that <HI>our times</HI> are not at our own disposal, we are taught, by the text, that they are <HI>in the hand of God.</HI> This may be consider∣ed in two views. Our times are in the hand of God, as a supreme Disposer of events. They are in the hand of God as a Guardian and a Father.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028306_0031_0FD894FE4AC4D600"/>
<HI>Our times,</HI> I say <HI>are in the hands of God</HI> as a su∣preme irresistible Ruler. All that is to happen to us in this and the succeeding years of our life,—if any succeeding years we shall be allowed to see,—has been foreknown and arranged by God. The first view, under which human affairs present themselves to us, is that of confused and irregular succession. The events of the world seem thrown together by chance, like the billows of the sea, tumbling and tos∣sing over each other, without rule or order. All that is apparent to us is the fluctuation of human caprice, and the operation of human passions. We see the strife of ambition, and the efforts of stratagem, la∣bouring to accomplish their several purposes among the societies of men. But it is no more than the sur∣face, the outside of things, that we behold. Higher counsels, than it is in our power to trace, are concern∣ed in the transactions of the world. If we believe in God at all, as the Governor of the universe, we must believe that, without his providence, nothing happens on earth. He over-rules, at his pleasure, the passions of men. He bends all their designs into subserviency to his decree. <HI>He makes the wrath of man to praise him</HI> and <HI>restrains,</HI> in what measure he thinks <HI>the remainder of wrath.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxvi. 10.</NOTE> He brings forth in their course all the generations of men. When the time is come for their entering into light, they appear on the stage; and when the time fixed for their dismission arrives, he <HI>changes their countenance,</HI> and sends them away. The time of our appearing is now come, after our ancestors had left their place, and gone down to the dust. We are at present permit∣ted to act our part freely, and without constraint. No violence is done to our inclination or choice.
<PB N="27" REF="028306_0032_0FD894FFBB10C210"/>But assuredly their is not a day of our life nor an event in that day, but was foreseen by God. That successi∣on of occurrences, which to us is full of obscurity and darkness, is all light and order in his view. He sees from the beginning to the end, and brings forward every thing that happens, in its due time and place.</P>
<P><HI>Our times are</HI> altogether <HI>in his hand.</HI> Let us take notice, that they are not in the hands either of our enemies, or of our friends. It is not in the power of man to shorten or to prolong our life, more or less than God has decreed. Enemies may employ craft or violence in their attacks; friends may employ skill and vigilance for the preservation of our health and safety; but both the one and the other can have effect only as far as God permits. They work in subservi∣ency to his purpose. By him they are held in invisible bonds. To the exertions of all human agents he says, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further.</HI></P>
<P>We are to observe next, that <HI>our times are in the hand of God,</HI> not only as an almighty Disposer, but as a merciful Guardian and Father. We are by no means to imagine, that from race to race, and from year to year, God sports with the lives of succeeding generations of men, or, in the mere wantonness of arbitrary power, brings them forth, and sends them away. No; if we have any confidence in what ei∣ther the light of nature suggests to all men, or what the revelation of the gospel has confirmed to Chris∣tians, we have full ground to believe, that the admin∣istration of human affairs is conducted with infinite wisdom and goodness. The counsels of the Almigh∣ty are indeed too deep for our limited understandings to trace. <HI>His path</HI> may often, as to as, be <HI>in the sea, and his footsteps in the mighty waters;</HI> while, neverthe∣less, <HI>all his paths are mercy and truth.</HI> He who, from
<PB N="28" REF="028306_0033_0FD895013AA95968"/>the benignity of his nature, erected this world for the abode of men; He who furnished it so richly for our accommodation, and stored it with so much beauty for our entertainment; He who since first we entered into life, hath followed us with such a variety of mer∣cies, surely can have no pleasure in our disappoint∣ment and distress. <HI>He knows our frame; he remembers we are dust;</HI> and looks to frail man, we are assured, with <HI>such pity as a father beareth to his children.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm ciii. 13, 14.</NOTE> To him we may safely commit ourselves, and all our concerns; as to one who is best qualified, both to di∣rect the incidents proper to happen to us in this world, and to judge of the time when it is fit for us to be re∣moved from it.</P>
<P>Even that ignorance of our future destiny in life, of which we sometimes complain, is a single proof of his goodness. He hides from us the view of fu∣turity, because the view would be dangerous and over∣powering. It would either dispirit us with visions of terror, or intoxicate us by the disclosure of success. The veil which covers from our sight the events of this and of succeeding years, is a veil woven by the hand of mercy. Our <HI>times are in his hand;</HI> and we have reason to be glad that in his hand they are kept, shut out from our view. Submit to his pleasure as an almighty Ruler we must, because we cannot resist him. Equal reason there is for trusting in him as a Guardian, under whose disposal we are sate.</P>
<P>Such is the import of the text, that <HI>our times are in the hand of God.</HI> Our times are unknown to us, and not under our own direction. They are in the hands of God as a Governor and Ruler; in the hands of God as a Guardian and Father. These separate views of the text require, on our part, separate im∣provements.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028306_0034_0FD895039547EFE0"/>
Seeing our times are not in our own hand, see∣ing futurity is unknown to us, let us, first, check the vain curiosity of penetrating into what is to come. Conjecture about futurity we often must; but upon all conjectures of what this year is to produce, let us lay a proper restraint. Let us wait till God shall bring forward events in their proper course, without wish∣ing to discover what he has concealed; lest, if the dis∣covery were granted, we should see many things, which we would wish not to have seen.</P>
<P>The most common propensity of mankind is to store futurity with whatever is agreeable to them; especi∣ally in those periods of life when imagination is live∣ly, and hope is ardent. Looking forward to the year now beginning, they are ready to promise themselves much from the foundations of prosperity which they have laid; from the friendships and connections which they have secured; from the plans of conduct which they have formed. Alas! how deceitful do all these dreams of happiness often prove! While many are saying in secret to their hearts, <HI>To-morrow shall be as this day and more abundantly,</HI> we are obliged in return to say to them, <HI>Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</HI> I do not mean, that in the unknown prospect which lies before us, we should forebode to ourselves nothing but mis∣fortunes. —May it be the pleasure of Heaven that this year run on in a placid and tranquil tenor to us all!—But this I say, that in such foresight of futu∣rity as we are allowed to take, we may reckon upon it as certain, that this year shall prove to us, as many past have proved, a chequered scene of some com∣forts and some troubles. In what proportion one or other of these shall prevail in it; whether, when it ends, it shall leave with us the memory of joys or of sorrows, is to be determined by him in whose hands
<PB N="30" REF="028306_0035_0FD895054CA30FC8"/><HI>our times are.</HI> Our wisdom is, to be prepared for whatever the year is to bring; prepared to receive comforts with thankfulness, troubles with fortitude; and to improve both for the great purposes of virtue and eternal life.</P>
<P>Another important instruction which naturally a∣rises from our times not being in our own hands is, that we ought no longer to trifle with what it is not in our power to prolong; but that we should make haste to live as wise men; nor delaying till to-morrow what may be done to day; <HI>doing now with all our might whatever our hand findeth to do;</HI> before that <HI>night cometh wherein no man can work.</HI></P>
<P>Admists the uncertainty of the events which are be∣fore us, there is one thing we have too much reason to believe namely, that of us who are now assembled in this congregation, and who have seen the year begin, there are some who shall not survive to see it close. Whether it shall be you, or you, or I, who shall be gathered to our fathers before the revolving year has finished its round, God alone knows. <HI>Our times are in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and?</HI> But to our place, it is more than proba∣ble that some of us shall have gone. Could we foretel the month, or the day, on which our change was to happen, how diligent would we be in setting our house in order, and preparing ourselves to appear be∣fore our Maker? Surely, that ought to be prepared for with most care, concerning which we are igno∣rant how soon it is to take place. Let us therefore <HI>walk circumspectly,</HI> and <HI>redeem the time.</HI> Let us dismiss those trivial and supersluous cares which burden or corrupt our life, in order to attend to what is of highest importance to us as men and Christians. The beginning of each year should carry to us all a solemn admonition of our folly, in neglecting to improve suitably the years that are past. It should call up
<PB N="31" REF="028306_0036_0FD895067B56C008"/>mispent time into our view; and be like the hand coming forth upon the wall, in the days of Belshazzar, and writing in legibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> characters over against us, <Q>O man! thy days are numbered; thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting; take care lest thy kingdom be on the point of departing from thee.</Q></P>
<P>When we consider, in the next place, that our times as I before illustrated, are in the hand of God as a so∣vereign Disposer, it is an obvious inference from this truth, that we should prepare ourselves to submit pa∣tiently to his pleasure both as to the events which are to fill up our days, and as to the time of our continu∣ing in this world. To contend with him we know to be fruitless. The word that is gone ont of his moath must stand. In the path which he has marked out for us, whether it be short or long, rugged or smooth, we must walk. Is it not then the dictate of wisdom, that we should previously reconcile ourselves to this soverign ordination, and bring our minds to harmon∣ize with what is appointed to be our destiny? Let us fortify this temper, by recalling that reflection of the wise man; <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life; all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. v 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>To enjoy long life, and see many days, is the uni∣versal with; and, as the wish is proinpted by nature it cannot be in itself unlawful. At the same time, several circumstances concur to temper the eagerness of this wish; and to show us that it should always be formed under due submission to the wiser judge∣ment of Heaven. Who among us can tell, whe∣ther, in wishing for the continuance of many years on earth, we may not be only wishing for a prolonga∣tion
<PB N="32" REF="028306_0037_0FD87F3BC5817068"/>of distress and misery?—You might live, my friends, till you had undergone lingering rounds of severe pain, from which death would have proved a seasonable deliverance. You might live till your breasts were pierced with many a wound from public calamities or private sorrows. You might live till you beheld the death of all whom you had loved; till you survived all those who love you; till you were left as desolate strangers on earth, in the midst of a new race, who neither knew you, nor cared for you, but who wished you off the stage.—Of a nature so ambiguous are all the prospects which life sets before us, that in every wish we form, relating to them, much reason we have to be satisfied that our times are in the hands of God, rather than our own.</P>
<P>This consideration is greatly strengthened when, in the last place, we think of God acting, not as a Sovereign only, but as a Guardian, in the disposal of our times. This is our great consolation in look∣ing forward to futurity. To God as a wise Ruler, calm submission is due; but it is more than submis∣sion that belongs to him as a merciful Father; it is the spirit of cordial and affectionate consent to his will. Unknown to us as the times to come are, it should be sufficient to our full repose that they are known to God. The day and the hour which are fixed in his counsels for our dismission from life, we ought to be persuaded are fixed for the best; and that any longer we should not wish to remain.</P>
<P>When we see that last hour drawing nigh, though our spirits may be composed on our own account, yet, on account of our friends and families, no little anxiety and sorrow may be sometimes apt to take pos∣session of the mind. Long we have enjoyed the com∣fort of their society, and been accustomed to consider them as parts of ourselves. To be parted from them
<PB N="33" REF="028306_0038_0FD89508009B9FD8"/>forever is, at any rate, a bitter thought; but to the bitterness of this, is over and above added the appre∣hension of their suffering much by our death. We leave many a relation, perhaps may leave young chil∣dren, and a helpless family, behind us, to be expos∣ed to various dangers, and thrown forth on an un∣friendly world. Such virtuous anxieties often oppress the tender and feeling heart at the closing periods of life.—My brethren, look up to that God, in whose hands <HI>the times</HI> of your fathers were; in whose hand <HI>the times</HI> of your posterity shall be. Recollect, for your comfort, the experience of ages. When were the righteous utterity forsaken by God in times past? Why should they be forsaken by him in times to come; Well did he govern the world before you had a being in it: Well shall he continue to govern it af∣ter you are no more. No cause have you, therefore, to oppress your minds with the load of unknown fu∣turity. Commit your cares to a Father in heaven. Surrender your friends, and your family, to that God, who hath said, <HI>The children of his servants shall con∣tinue, and their seed shall be established before him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cii. 28.</NOTE>— <HI>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xlix. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have thus shewn what the import is, and what the improvement should be, of the doctrine of the text, that <HI>our times are in the hand of God.</HI> It asserts a fact, the the truth of which can be called in ques∣tion by none; a fact which, whether persons have any sentiments of religion or not, is calculated to make a serious impression on every mind; especial∣ly at seasons when the revolution of years gives us warning that our duration on earth is measured, and advances towards its period. To persons who are
<PB N="34" REF="028306_0039_0FD8950AC0608308"/>religiously disposed, who study to improve life to its proper purposes, to do their duty towards God and man, and through the merits of their Redeemer to obtain grace and favour from Heaven, the doctrine of the text is still more important. Among them it tends to awaken impressions which are not only seri∣ous, but, as I have shown, salutary and comforting to the heart.—Thankful that our times are in the hand of a Sovereign, who is both wise and gracious, let us prepare ourselves to meet the approaching events of life with becoming resignation, and at the same time with manly constancy and firm trust in God. As long as it shall please him to continue our abode in the world, let us remain faithful to our duty; and when it shall please him to give the command for, our remo∣val hence, let us utter only this voice: <Q>In thy hand O my God, <HI>my times are.</HI> Thou art calling me away. Here I am, ready to obey thy call, and at thy signal to go forth. I thank thee that I have been admitted to pertake so long of the comforts of life, and to be a spectator of the wisdom and good∣ness displayed in thy works. I thank thee that thou hast borne so long with my infirmities and provo∣cations; hast allowed me to look up to thy promises in the gospel, and to hear the words of eternal life uttered by my great Redeemer. With gratitude faith, and hope I commit my soul to thee. <HI>Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</HI></Q>—Such are the sentiments with which every pious and good man should con∣clude his life. Such indeed are the sentiments which he ought to carry through every part of life. With these may we begin, and with these conclude, every succeeding year which God shall think fit to add to our earthly existence!</P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV. ON THE <HI>MIXTURE</HI> OF <HI>BAD MEN</HI> WITH THE <HI>GOOD</HI> IN <HI>HUMAN SOCIETY.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTH. xiii. 30.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Let both grow together until the harvest.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE parable, of which these words are a part, contains a prophetical description of the state of the church. Our Lord predicts that the societies of Christians were to be infected with persons of loose principles and bad disposition, whom he likens to <HI>tares</HI> springing up among <HI>wheat.</HI> He intimates that there should arise some whose officious zeal would prompt the desire of exterminating immediately all such evil men; but that this were contrary to the de∣signs of providence, and to the spirit of Christianity; that a complete separation was indeed to be made at last between the good and the bad; but that this se∣peration was to be delayed till the end of the world, when, in the stile of the parable, the <HI>tares</HI> should be entirely <HI>gathered out from among the wheat. Let both grow together until the harvest.</HI></P>
<P>When we look around us, nothing is more conspi∣cuous in the state of the world, than that broad mix∣ture of the religious and the impious, the virtuous and the wicked, which we find taking place in every society. Strong objections seem hence to arise against
<PB N="36" REF="028306_0041_0FD8950D3A5E6DB8"/>either the wisdom or goodness of divine Providence; especially when we behold bad men not only tolerated in the world, but occasionally exalted in their cir∣cumstances, to the depression of the just. Why, it will be said, if a Supreme Being exist, and if his justice rule the universe, does he allow such infamous persons as the records of history often present, to have a place, and even to make a figure in his world? Why sleeps the thunder idle in his hand, when it could so easily blast them? What shall we think of one who, having the power of exterminat∣ing them always at his command, permits them to proceed without disturbance; nay, sometimes ap∣pears to look on them with complacency?—It be∣comes highly worthy of our attention to consider what answer can be made to these objections; to inquire whether any reasons can be given that serve to justify this dispensation of Providence, in allowing a mix∣ture of bad men to continue on the face of the earth until the end of time. This inquiry shall make the subject of the present discourse, together with such re∣flections as naturally arise from surveying the state of human affairs.</P>
<P>But, before entering directly on such inquiry, it may be proper to take notice, that, in our estimation of who are the good, who are the bad, we are often in hazard of committing mistakes. The real cha∣racters of men are known only to God. They fre∣quently depend on the secret and unseen parts of life. As in judging of themselves men are always partial, so in judging of others they often err, through the imperfect information which they have gathered, or the rash prejudices which they have formed. They are too apt to limit the character of virtue to those who agree wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h them in sentiment and belief; and exaggerate the failings of those against whom they
<PB N="37" REF="028306_0042_0FD8950EC66AB340"/>have conceived dislike, into great and unpardonable crimes. Were it left to the indiscreet zeal of some to extirpate from the earth all those whom they con∣sider as bad men, there is ground to apprehend that, instead of tares the wheat would often be rooted out.—At the same time, we readily admit the fact, as too manifest to be denied, that a multitude of gross and notorious sinners are now mixed with the followers of God and virtue. Let us proceed then to consider how far this is consistent with the justice and wisdom of the Govenor of the world.</P>
<P>It is a principle in which all serious and reflecting persons have agreed, and which by many arguments is confirmed, that our present state on earth is design∣ed to be a state of discipline and improvement, in or∣der to fit human nature for a higher and better state which it is to attain hereafter. Now, this principle being once admitted, we say, that the mixture of vir∣tue and vice which here prevails, is calculated to an∣swer this purpose better than a more unmixed and perfect state of society would have done.</P>
<P>For, in the first place, the crimes of the wicked give occasion to the exercise of many excellent dispo∣sitions of heart among the righteous. They bring forth all the suffering virtues, which otherwise would have had no field; and by the exercise of which the human character is tried, and acquires some of its chief honours. Were there no bad men in the world to vex and distress the good, the good might appear in the light of harmless innocence; but could have no opportunity of displaying fidelity, magnanimity, patience, and fortitude. One half of virtue, and not the least important half, would be lost to the world. In our present imperfect state, any virtue which is never exercised is in hazard of becoming extinct in the human breast. If goodness constantly proceeded
<PB N="38" REF="028306_0043_0FD895103B4101A0"/>in a smooth and flowery path; if, meeting with no adversary to oppose it, it were surrounded on every hand with acclamation and praise, is there no ground to dread that it might be corrupted by vanity, or might sink into indolence? This dangerous calm must there∣fore be interrupted. The waters must be troubled, lest they should stagnate and putrify. When you be∣hold wicked men multiplying in number, and increas∣ing in power, imagine not that Providence particular∣ly favours them. No; they are suffered for a time to prosper, that they may fulfil the high designs of heaven. They are employed as instruments in the hand of God for the improvement of his servants. They are the rods with which he chastens the virtu∣ous, in order to rouse them from a dangerous slum∣ber; to form them for the day of adversity, and to teach them how to suffer honourably.</P>
<P>In the next place, the mixture of the bad among the good serves not only to give exercise to the passive graces, but also to improve the active powers and vir∣tues of man. It inures the righteous to vigilance and exertion. It obliges them to stand forth, and act their part with firmness and constancy in evil times. It gives occasion for their virtues to shine with conspi∣cuous lustre; and makes them appear as <HI>the lights of the world</HI> amidst surrounding darkness. Were it not for the dangers that arise from abounding iniquity, there would be no opportunity for courage to act, for wisdom to admonish, for caution to watch, nor for faith to exert itself in <HI>overcoming the world.</HI> It is that mixture of disposition which now takes place, that renders the theatre on which we act so busy and stir∣ring, and so much fitted for giving employment to every part of man's intelligent and moral nature. It affords a complete field for the genuine display of cha∣racters; and gives every man the opportunity to come
<PB N="39" REF="028306_0044_0FD87F3D5A194258"/>forth and show what he is. Were the terror of hu∣man conduct altogether regular and uniform, inter∣rupted by no follies and vices, no cross dispositions and irregular passions, many of our active powers would find no exercise. Perhaps even our life would languish, and become too still and insipid. Man is not yet ripe for a paradise of innocence, and for the enjoyment of a perfect and faultless society. As in the natural world, he is not made for perpetual spring and cloudless skies, but by the wintry storm must be calied to exert his abilities for procuring shelter and defence; so in the moral world, intermixture of bad men renders many an exertion necessary, which in a perfect state of the world would find no place, but which in the present state of trial is proper and use∣ful.—The existence of vice in the world assuredly testifies our present corruption; and according to the degree of its prevalence, is always, more or less, the source of misery. It is a standing proof of the fall and degeneracy of man. But as long as that fallen state continues, the wisdom of Providence eminently ap∣pears in making the errors and frailties of the wick∣ed subservient to the improvement of the just. <HI>Tares</HI> are for that reason suffered at present to grow up <HI>among the wheat.</HI></P>
<P>These observations on the wisdom of Providence in this dispensation will be farther illustrated, by con∣sidering the useful instructions which we receive, or which at least every wise man may receive, from the follies and vices of those among whom we are obliged to live.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> They furnish instruction concerning the snares and dangers against which we ought to be most on our guard. They put it thereby in our power to profit by the errors and misconduct of others. By observing from what small beginnings the greatest
<PB N="40" REF="028306_0045_0FD89512D3DBD108"/>crimes have arisen; observing how bad company has seduced this man from his original principles and ha∣bits; how a careless indulgence of pleasure has blind∣ed and intoxicated that man; how the neglect of di∣vine institutions has, in another, gradually paved the way for open profligacy; much salutary instruction is conveyed to the virtuous. Tracing the dangerous and slippery paths by which so many have been insensibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etrayed into ruin, their views of human nature are enlarged; the sense of their own imbecility is strong∣ly impressed upon them; accompanied with the con∣viction of the necessity of a constant dependence on the grace and assistance of heaven. All the crimes which they behold disturbing society around them, serve as signals hung out to them, beacons planted in their view, to prevent their making shipwreck among those rocks on which others have split. It has been justly said, that not only from the advices of his friends, but from the reproaches of his enemies, a wise man may draw instruction. In the same man∣ner, it is not only by the examples of good men, but likewise by those of the wicked, that an attentive mind may be confirmed in virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Next.</HI> These examples of bad men, while they ad∣monish the virtuous of the dangers against which they are to guard, are farther profitable by the views which they exhibit of the evil and the deformity of sin. Its odious nature never appears in so strong a light as when displayed in the crimes of the wicked. It is true that, when vice is carried to a certain de∣gree, and disguised by plausible colours, it may pass unreproved, and even for a while seem popular in the world. But it is no less true that, when it becomes open and flagrant, and is deprived of the shadow of virtue, it never fails to in our general reproach, and to become the object either of contempt or of hatred.
<PB N="41" REF="028306_0046_0FD895140008F110"/>How often, for instance, have the abilities, which once drew esteem and admiration, sunk, in a short time, into the most humiliating degradation mere∣ly through the ascendant which corrupted inclinations and low habits had acquired over their possessor? How often have the rising honours of the young been blasted, by their forsaking the path of honour on which they had once entered, for the blind and crook∣ed tracts of depravity and folly? Such spectacles of the infamy of vice, such memerials of the disgrace at∣tending it, are permitted by Providence for general instruction and are assuredly edifying to the world. It was necessary, for moral improvement, that the beau∣ty and excellence of virtue, and the deformity of vice, should be strongly impressed on every intelligent mind. This could never be done with so great advantage as by the striking contrasts of both which are produced by the living examples of evil men intermixed with the good. It is in this mirror that we clearly contem∣plate how much the <HI>righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>The same purpose of important instruction is far∣ther promoted by the instances of misery which the state of wicked men on earth affords. I admit that the worldly success, which sometimes attends them, may blind and seduce the unwary; but a little more reffection enables men to distinguish between appar∣ent success and real happiness. The condition of worthless men, whatever splendor riches may throw around them, is easily discerned to be a restless and miserable one; and the misery which they suffer, to be derived from their vices. In that great corrupted crowd which surrounds us, what incestant bustle and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ir, what agitation and tumults take place? What env<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and jealousy of one another? How much hitterness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tment do we behold among them; mutually
<PB N="42" REF="028306_0047_0FD89515809093B8"/>deceiving and deceived; supplanting and supplanted; ever pursuing, but never satisfied? These are not mat∣ters of rare observation, or which require nice scru∣tiny to discover them. We need only open our eyes to behold the wicked tormented by their passions, and far removed from that sanctuary of calmness and tran∣quillity which is the abode of real happiness. Nay, when we appeal to bad men themselves, after they have run the whole round of vicious pleasures, we will often find them obliged to confess, that the wretched result of their pursuits has been <HI>vanity and vexation of spirit;</HI> and that the happiest days they have enjoyed were in the times of innocence; before criminal desires and guilty passions had taken posses∣sion of their breasts. Such practical demonstrations as these of the infelicity of sin are yielded by the examples of evil doers whom we see around us. By attending to their situation, the misery, as well as infamy of guilt is realised, and rendered sensible to our appre∣hension.</P>
<P>Thus, upon a fair inquiry, you behold how the ways of God may, in this remarkable case, be justi∣fied to man. You behold what important ends are advanced, by permitting <HI>the tares</HI> at present to <HI>grow together with the wheat.</HI> The intermixture of evil men in human society serves to exercise the suffering graces and virtues of the good; by the diversity of characters among those with whom they have inter∣course, it serves to bring forth and improve their ac∣tive powers and virtues, and to enlarge the circle of useful occupations; it ferves to instruct them in the temptations against which they are to guard, to reveal to them all the deformity of vice, and to make its mise∣ries pass conspicuously before their eyes. When we con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der them as actors on the theatre of the world, they are thereby improved in the part they have to perform.
<PB N="43" REF="028306_0048_0FD89516FA505840"/>When we consider them as spectators of what is pass∣ing on that theatre, their minds are thereby instruct∣ed; their views rectified and enlarged by the objects that are set before them.</P>
<P>From these important truths, several reflections no less important arise.</P>
<P>We are naturally taught, in the first place, never to be hasty in finding fault with any of the arrangements of Providence. The present permission of moral evil on the earth seemed, on the first view, to furnish a strong objection against either the wisdom or the goodness of the Author of nature. After beholding the useful purposes which are answered by that per∣mission, how cautious should we be in advancing any of our rash speculations against his government and conduct! To our confined and humble station it belongs not to censure, but to submit, trust, and adore; satisfied that the farther we enquire, the rec∣titude of his ways will appear the more; thankful for the discoveries of them which have been imparted to us; and persuaded that, where our discoveries fail, it is not because there is no more wisdom or goodness to be seen, but because our present condition allows us not to see more.</P>
<P>In the second place, let us be taught with what eye we are to look upon those bad men whom we find around us in the world. Not surely with an eye of envy. Whatever prosperity they may seem to enjoy, they are still no more than <HI>tares,</HI> the weeds of the field; contemptible in the sight of God; tolerated by his providence for a while on account of the right∣eous, to whose improvement they are rendered sub∣servient. The parable informs us that, in the end, they are to be <HI>gathered and burnt.</HI> In this life only they have <HI>their good things.</HI> But their prosperity is transitory. <HI>They are brought into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>solation in a moment,
<PB N="44" REF="028306_0049_0FD8951889BC08F0"/>and utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh, so, O God, when thou awakest, thou sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt despise their image</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm Ixxiii. 19.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.— When we consider their un∣happy state, it becomes us to behold them with the eye of pity. Let us remember that, in the midst of their errors, they are by nature still our brethren. Let us not behave to them in the spirit of bitterness. In∣sult not their follies. Pride not yourselves on superior virtue. Remember that, as bad men are mixed with the good, so, in the best men, vices are at present mixed with virtues. Your own character, good as you may esteem it, is not free from every evil taint; and in the characters of those whom you reprobate as vitious, there are always some good qualities mix∣ed with the bad ones. Study, as far as you can, to reclaim and amend them; and if, in any degree, you have been profited by their failings, endeavour, in return, to profit them, by good counsel and advice, by advice, not administered with officious zeal, or self-conceited superiority, but with the tenderness of compassion and real friendship.</P>
<P>In the third place, in whatever proportion the ad∣mixture of vice may seem to take place in the world, let us never despair of the prevalence of virtue on the whole. Let us not exaggerate, beyond measure, the quantity of vice that is found in the mixture. It is proper to observe, that in the parable now before us, af∣ter the owner of the field had <HI>sown his good seed,</HI> no rea∣son is given us to think, that the good seed was en∣tirely chocked up by <HI>tares.</HI> On the contrary, we are told that <HI>the blade sprung up, and brought forth fruit;</HI> and, though the <HI>tares</HI> also arose, yet, in the end there was a <HI>harvest,</HI> when the <HI>wheat was reaped and gathered into the barn.</HI> In the most corrupted times, God never leaves
<PB N="45" REF="028306_0050_0FD8951A09293AE8"/>himself without many witnesses on earth. He is al∣ways at entive to the cause of goodness; and frequent∣ly supports and advances, it by means which we are una<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to trace. He nourishes much piety and virtue in hearts that are unknown to us; and beholds repen∣tance ready to spring up among many whom we con∣sider a reprobates.—I know that it has always been comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for persons to represent the age in which they live as the worst that ever appeared; and religion and virtue as just on the point of vanishing from among m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. This is the language sometimes of the serious; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ten of the hypocritical, or of the narrow-minded. But true religion gives no sanction to such severe cen∣sures, or such gloomy views. Though the <HI>tares</HI> must be at all times springing up, there is no reason for be∣lieving that they shall ever overspread the whole field. The nature of the weeds that spring up may vary, ac∣cording to the nature of the soil. Different modes of iniquity may distinguish different ages of the world; while the sum of corruption is nearly the same. Let not our judgments of men, and of the times in which we live, be hasty and presumptuous. Let us trust in the grace of God; and hope the best of mankind.</P>
<P>In the fourth and last place, let us keep our eyes ever fixed on that important period, which is alluded to in the text, as the conclusion of all. <HI>Let both grow together until the harvest.</HI> The great spiritual year is to be closed by <HI>a harvest,</HI> when <HI>the householder is to ga∣ther the wheat into his barn;</HI> when, at the end of the world, the final distinction of men and characters is to take place. The confused mixture of good and evil, which now prevails, is only a temporary dis∣pensation of Providence, accommodated to man's fal∣len and imperfect state. Let it not tempt us for a moment to distrust the reality of the divine govern∣ment; or to entertain the remotest suspicion that mor∣al
<PB N="46" REF="028306_0051_0FD8951B80D64778"/>good and evil are to be on the same terms forever. The frailties of our nature fitted us for no more at present than the enjoyment of a very mixed and im∣perfect society. But when our nature, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ified and refined, shall become ripe for higher advancement, then shall the spirits of the just, disengaged from any polluted mixture, undisturbed by sin or by sinners, be united in one divine assembly, and rejoice forever in the presence of him who made them. Looking forward to this glorious issue with stedfast faith, let no cross appearances every discomfit our hopes, or lead us to suspect that we have been serving God in vain. If we continue <HI>faithful to the death,</HI> we may rest ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, that in due time we shall <HI>receive the crown of life.</HI></P>

<P>THE life of man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n earth is doomed to be cloud∣ed with various evils. Throughout all ranks, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> afflicted form a considerable proportion of the human race; and even they who have a title to be called pros∣perous, are always, in some periods of their life, ob∣liged to drink from the cup of bitterness. The Chris∣tian religion is particularly entitled to our regard, by accommodating itself with great tenderness to this distressed condition of mankind. It is not to be con∣sidered as merely an au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oritative system of precepts. Important precepts it indeed delivers for the wise and proper regulation of life. But the same voice which enj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s our duty, utters the words of consolation. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spel deserves to be held a dispensation of relief to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nkind under both the temporal and spiritual dis∣tresses of their state.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="028306_0053_0FD8951EA8D1C0B8"/>
This amiable and compassionate spirit of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eli∣gion conspicously appears in the character of its great Author. It shone in all his actions while he lived on earth. It breathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all his discourses; and, in the words of the text, is expressed with much energy. In the preceding verse, he had given a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh account of his own person and dignity. <HI>All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</HI> But least any of his hearers should be discour∣aged by this mysterious representation of his greatness, he instantly tempers it with the most gracious be∣nignity; declaring, in the text, the merciful inten∣tion of his mission to the world, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing which claims our attention in these words is, what we are to understand by <HI>coming unto Christ.</HI> This is a phrase which has often given oc∣casion to controversey. By theological writers it has been involved in much needless mystery, while the meaning in itself is plain and easy. The very me∣taphor that is here used serves to explain it. In the ancient world, disciples flocked round their different teachers, and attended them wherever they went; in order both to testify their attachment, and to imbibe more fully the doctrine of their masters. <HI>Coming unto Christ,</HI> therefore, is the same with resorting to him as our declared Master? acknowledging ourselves his disciples, believers in his doctrine, and followers of his precepts. As Christ is made known to us un∣der the character both of a Teacher and a Saviour, our <HI>coming to him</HI> imports not only submission to his instructions, but confidence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his power to save. It imports that, forsaking the corruptions of sin and the world, we follow that course of virtue and obedi∣ence
<PB N="49" REF="028306_0054_0FD895217A3108A0"/>which he points out to us; relying on his med∣iation for pardon of our offences, and acceptance w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h heaven. This is what is implied in the scripture term <HI>Faith;</HI> which includes both the assent of the under∣standing to the truth of the Christian religion, and the concurrence of the will in receiving it.</P>
<P>What next occurs in the text to attract our notice is the description of those to whom the invitation is addressed. All those who <HI>labour and are heavy laden,</HI> that is, who, in one way or other, feel themselves grieved and dutressed, are here invited to come to Christ.—Now, from two sources chiefly our distress∣es arise; from moral, or from natural causes.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> They may arise from inward moral causes; from certain feelings and reflections of the mind, which occasion uneasiness and pain. A course of sin and vice always proves ruinous and destructive in the issue. But its tendency to ruin is often not perceiv∣ed, while that tendency is advancing. For as sin is the reign of passion and pleasure, it forms men to a thoughtless inconsiderate state. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cumstances, how∣ever, may occur, and frequent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, in the course of life, do occur, which disclose to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vicious man the ruin which he is bringing on himself, as an offender against the God who made him. When some occa∣sional confinement to solitude, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> some turn of ad∣verse fortune, directs his attention immediately up∣on his own character; or when, drawing towards the close of life, his passions subside, his pleasures withdraw, and a future state comes forward to his view; in such situations it often happens, that the past follies and crimes of such a man appear to him in a light most odious and shocking; and not odious only, but terrifying to his heart. He considers that he is undoubtedly placed under the government of a just God, who did not send him into this world for
<PB N="50" REF="028306_0055_0FD89522FA275058"/>nought; that he has neglected the part assigned to him; has contemned the laws of heaven; has de∣graded his own nature; and instead of being useful, having been hurtful and pernicious to those among whom he lived, is about to leave a detestable memo∣ry behind him.—What account shall he give of him∣self to his Maker; Self condemned, polluted by so many crimes, how can he expect to find mercy in his sight; Hence, an overwhelmed and dejected mind; hence, dismal forebodings of punishment; hence, that <HI>wounded spirit,</HI> which, when it is deeply pierced, becomes the forest of all human evils, and has some∣times rendered existence a burden which could not be endured.</P>
<P>Such distresses as these, arising from moral internal causes, may be made light of by the giddy and the vain; and represented as confined to a few persons only of distempered imagination. But to those whose professions give them occasion to see men under vari∣ous circumstances of affliction, they are known to be far from being unfrequent in the world; and on many more occasions than is commonly imagined, to throw over the human mind the blackest gloom of which it is susceptible. Religious feelings, be assured, have a deep root in the nature of man. They form a part of the human constitution. They are interwoven with many of those fears and hopes which actuates us in the changing situations of fortune. During the gay and active periods of life, they may be smothered; but with most men, they are smothered rather than totally obliterated: And if any crisis of our condition shall awaken, and bring them forth, in their full force upon a conscious guilty heart, woe to the man, who, in some disconsolate season, is doomed to suffer their extreme vengeance!</P>
<P>But, while under such distresses of the mind not
<PB N="51" REF="028306_0056_0FD895247B452050"/>a few may be said to <HI>labour and to be heavy laden,</HI> great∣er still is the multitude of those who, from natural external causes, from the calamities and evils of life, undergo much suffering and misery. The life of man is not indeed wholly composed of misery. It admits of many, pleasing scenes. On the whole, there is reason to believe that it affords more joy than grief. At the same time, the unfortunate, as I before obser∣ved, form always a numerous class of mankind; and it may be said with truth, that <HI>sore travel is ordained for the sons of men.</HI> Though the burden is not equally laid on all; some there always are, on whom it falls with oppressive weight.—Unexpected disappoint∣ments have crushed their hopes, and blasted the plans which they had formed for comfort in the world. The world had, perhaps, smiled upon them once, only to give them a feeling of its miseries at the last. Struggling with poverty, unable to support their fam∣ilies whom they see languishing around them, they, at the same time, are obliged by their situation in so ciety to conceal their necessities; and under the for∣ced appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance of cheerfulness, to hide from the world a broken heart. They are st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, perhaps, by the un∣kindness of friends; cast off by those in whom they had trusted; or torn by untimely death from real friends, in connection with whom they might have flourished and been happy; at the same time borne down, it may be, with the infirmities of a sickly body, and left to drag a painful life without assistance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relief. —How many sad scenes of this nature, on which it were painful to insist, does the world afford?</P>
<P>When we turn to those who are accounted prosper∣ous men, we shall always find many sorrows mingled with their pleasures; many hours of care and vexa∣tion, wherein they acknowledge themselves classed with those who <HI>labour and are heavy laden.</HI> In en∣tering
<PB N="52" REF="028306_0057_0FD89525FA9EC660"/>into some gay festive assembly, we behold af∣fected cheerfulness displayed on every contenance; and might fancy that we had arrived at the temple of unmixed pleasure and gladness of heart. Yet, even there, could we look into the bosoms of these appar∣ently happy persons, how often would we find them inwardly preyed upon by some tormenting suspicions some anxious fears, some secret griefs which either they dare not disclose to the world, or from which, if disclosed, they can look for no relief?—In short, amidst that great company of pilgrims, who are jour∣neying through life, many there are whose journey lies through a valley of tears; and many to whom that valley is only cheered by transient glimpses of joy.</P>
<P>To these classes of mankind is addressed the invi∣tation of the text. To them, it is in a particular manner addressed; overlooking the giddy and dissi∣pated multitude. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</HI> Not as if our Saviour were always ready to accept that sort of piety which is merely the consequence of distress; or made all those welcome, who are driven by nothing but fear or danger to have recourse to him. His words are to be understood as intimating, that the heart which is humbled and soft∣ened by affliction, is the object of his compassionate regard; that he will not reject us merely because we have been cast off by the world; but that, if with proper dispositions and sentiments we apply to him in the evil day, we shall be sure of meeting with a graci∣ous reception. It now remains to show, what that re∣ception is which we may look for; what that rest is which Christ hath promised to confer on those who <HI>come to him;</HI> whether their distresses arise from moral or natural causes. <HI>Come unto me, and I will give you rest.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="53" REF="028306_0058_0FD8952780477CC8"/>
1. Christ affords rest to the disturbed mind that la∣bours under apprehensions and fears of guilt. Let those who suffer distress of this nature <HI>come to Christ,</HI> that is, with contrition and repentance, have recourse to him as their Saviour, and they shall regain quietness and peace. Foolish and guilty they have been; and justly lie under dread of punishment; but the peni∣tent sorrow which they now feel, implies their dispo∣sition to be changed. It implies, as far as it is gen∣uine, that, sensible of their folly, they now desire to become good and wise; and are determined for the future to hold a virtuous course, could they only hope to obtain pardon for the past. In this situation of mind, let them not be cast down and despair. Christ has brought with him from heaven the olive branch. He carries in his hand the signal of forgiveness. The declaration which he publishes is, <HI>Let the wicked for∣sake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lv. 7.</NOTE> Insufficient though our own repentance be, to pro∣cure pardon from heaven, we are informed, that an all-sufficient atonement has been made by Christ. Neither the number nor the atrocity of offences ex∣cludes, from forgiveness, the penitent who returns to his duty. To all who come under this description, the offer of mercy extends, without exception. <HI>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>This discovery of divine government, afforded by the Gospel, is perfectly calculated to scatter the gloom which had over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast the desponding heart. The at∣mosphere clears up on every side; and is illuminat∣ed
<PB N="54" REF="028306_0059_0FD895290055BD38"/>by cheering rays of celestial mercy. Not only is hope given to the penitent, but it is rendered sin∣ful not to indulge that hope. We are not only al∣lowed and encouraged, but we are commanded to trust in the divine clemency. We are commanded to believe that <HI>none who come unto Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will in any wise cost out.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi 37.</NOTE> <HI>As I live saith the Lord God, I have no plea∣sure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked urn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ays; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezek xxxiii. 11.</NOTE>—Such is the re∣lief which the religion of Christ brings to them who <HI>la∣bour and are heavy laden</HI> under the impressions of guilt and divine displeasure; a relief which nothing can render ineffectual to the heart, except the most gloomy superstition, founced on gross misconceptions of the nature and attributes of God. Let us now.</P>
<P N="2">II. Consider what <HI>rest</HI> the religion of Christ gives to them whose distress arises not from inward and moral, but from natural and external causes; from adverse fortune, or any of those numerous calamities to which we are at present exposed To such per∣sons, it may seem more difficult to promise any ef∣fectual relief. In the former case, the distress lay entirely in the mind. As soon as its views are rec∣tified, and its apprehensions quieted, the evil is remov∣ed, and the cure effected. Here, the distress arises from without; and the religion of Christ affects not the course of external events. But though it removes not all the evils of life, though it promises no contin∣uance of undisturbed prosperity, (which indeed it were not sulutary for man always to enjoy) yet, if it mit∣igates the evils which necessarily belong to our state, and supports us under them, it may justly be said to give <HI>rest to them who labour and are heavy laden.</HI> When
<PB N="55" REF="028306_0060_0FD8952A7A2095B0"/>much that is material and important is effected, we have no cause to complain, though all that we desire be not accomplished.—In this part of the discourse, I am to be considered as addressing myself not mere∣ly to such as are at present suffering any severe ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am∣ity. I now speak to many, who, in the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st of health and affluence, enjoy the various comforts of life. But I must desire such persons to look forward to what may one day be their state. Let them reflect how important it is to prepare themselves for the fu∣ture unknown vicissitudes of the world. For, <HI>if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. xi. 8.</NOTE> —Now, either in the prospect of future distress, or under present suffering. I say, that the religion of Christ gives <HI>rest</HI> to the heart, by the forti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de which it inspires, and by the consolations which it affords.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It inspires fortitude. It discovers a supreme administration, so friendly to the interests of goodness, as never to allow the followers of Christ to dread, that, in any situation of for∣tune, they shall be neglected by Heaven. From the abstract consideration of the divine perfections, men had always some ground to believe, that the general order of the universe was consulted by its great Ruler. But how far the interest of individuals might be ob∣liged to yield, or, in many cases might be sacrificed, to this general order, they were left altogether in the dark. Here the gospel of Christ comes to our aid, by the explicit assurance which it gives, that, in the great system of Providence, the welfare of every sin∣gle good man is particularly included. <HI>All things,</HI> we are expressly told, are made to <HI>work together,</HI> not merely for the order and perfection of the whole, but also <HI>for good to them who love God.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom viii 28</NOTE> The life of eve∣ry
<PB N="56" REF="028306_0061_0FD8952C0D34D818"/>person, who comes under this description, forms a system complete within itself; where every event that happens to him possesses its destined place, and forms a link in that great chain of causes, which was appointed, from the beginning of things, for carry∣ing on his improvement and felicity. Such an arrange∣ment of the affairs of the world, may appear astonish∣ing to our narrow capacities; yet surely implies no ef∣fort beyond the reach of infinite power, joined with infinite wisdom and goodness.</P>
<P>Hence arises a degree of fortitude and constancy to good men, which can upon no other grounds be at∣tained. Faith, in these principles of the gospel, erects for them a fortiess, impregnable to the assaults of the world, into which they can at all times retreat. Sitting under the shelter of divine protection, they calmly hear the storm, when it blows with its utmost violence around them. <HI>The floods have lifted up their voice; they have lifted up all their waves But the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xciii. 34.</NOTE> Of the man who pos∣sesses such principles, it is justly said, <HI>His heart is es∣tablished; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxii. 7, 8.</NOTE> Tranquility, order, and magnanimity, dwell with him; while all is con∣fusion and trepidation among those, who have noth∣ing to look to but the apparent disorders of the world.</P>
<P>The doctrine of Christ not only arms us, in this manner, with fortitude against the approach of evil; but, supposing evils to fall upon us with their heav∣iest pressure, it lightens the load by many consolations to which others are strangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are visited, the hand of an offended sovereign, Christians are taught to view
<PB N="57" REF="028306_0062_0FD8952D8DAB09E8"/>them as the well-intended chastisements of a merci∣ful Father. They hear amidst them, that still voice which a good conscience brings to their ear: <HI>Fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xli. 10.</NOTE> They apply to themselves the comfortable promises with which the gospel abounds. They discover in these the happy issue decreed to their troubles; and wait with patience till Providence shall have accom∣plished its great and good designs. In the mean time, devotion opens to them its blessed and holy time, devotion opens to them its blessed and holy sanctuary: That sanctuary in which the wounded heart is healed, and the weary mind is at rest; where the cares of the world are forgotten, where its tu∣mults are hushed, and its miseries disappear; where greater objects open to our view than what the world presents; where a more serene sky shines, and a sweeter and calmer light beams on the afflicted heart. In those moments of devotion, a pious man, pour∣ing out his wants and sorrows to an almighty Sup∣porter, feels that he is not left solitary and forsaken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Christ and the Holy Ghost are with him; and, though he should be bereaved of every earthly friend, he can look up in heaven to a Friend who will never die.</P>
<P>To these present consolations, the religion of Christ adds the joyful prospect of that future state, where eternal <HI>rest remaineth for the people of God.</HI> This life they are taught to consider as only the <HI>house of their pilgrimage;</HI> the temporary mansion of painful though necessary discipline. But let them endure for a little and the pilgrimage shall end, the discipline shall be finished; and all the virtuous be assembled in those blissful regions which are prepared for their reward. Such a prospect cheers the darkest hours of life;
<PB N="58" REF="028306_0063_0FD8952EFB072CF0"/>and affords a remedy to every trouble. <HI>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 18.</NOTE> They appear in this comparative view, as no more than a distressing dream of the night, from which one awakes into health, and light, and joy.—Peculiar is this high consolation to the religion of Christ. It is what all nations had ea∣gerly wished for; what all philosophy had anxiously sought to discover; but what no research, no philo∣sophy were able to ascertain to mankind, till Christ brought the assurance of life and immortality from heaven; and conferred on his disciples this noble and inestimable gift.</P>
<P>Thus, on the whole, the Christain doctrine is found to be the great Medicine of life. It is the balm of human sorrows and cares. In our present state, where so many are suffering actual distress, of one kind or other, and where all have reason to dread the approach of distress, it is religion only that can alleviate the burdens of life, and smooth our passage through this evil world.—Let this view of religion persuade us to improve the sacred ordinance of our Lord's supper for <HI>coming unto Christ,</HI> in the way before explained: that is, joining ourselves to him as his disciples; his disciples, not in words and professions only, but in heart, and in truth; <HI>taking upon us his yoke,</HI> as is ad∣ded in the words immediately following the text; <HI>and learning of him who is meek and lowly in heart.</HI> Let those who labour under the sense of remembred follies and crimes, <HI>come unto Christ</HI> with penitent dispositions, and they shall obtain pardon. Let those who labour under the suffering of present, or the apprehension of future sorrows, <HI>come unto Christ,</HI> and they shall re∣ceive consolation. All who are in any sense <HI>hea∣vy
<PB N="59" REF="028306_0064_0FD8953151D25508"/>laden,</HI> coming unto him, shall find <HI>rest</HI> to their souls.</P>
<P>Before concluding this discourse, there is another set of men, not yet mentioned, to whom I must also address the exhortation in the text; those I mean, who labouring under none of the distressful burdens of life are surfeited of its pleasures; who labour under the burden only of languid ease, and the load of insipid prosperity. You drag, my friends, but a misearble existence. Oppressed by no sorrow, you feel vacuity and dissatisfaction within; you are often weary of life; and in your solitary hours, are disposed to con∣fess that all you have experienced is vanity. Where∣fore should you any longer <HI>spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satis∣fieth not? Come to the waters which are now offered to you, and drink. Hear, and your souls shall live.</HI> Re∣treat from the corrupting vanities of the world, to Christ, to religion, and to virtue. New sources of enjoyment shall then be opened to you. A world yet untried shall display itself to your view. You shall be formed to a relish for the quiet and innocent pleasures of piety and devotion; of friendship, and good affec∣tions; of useful knowledge, and virtuous activity; of calm society, and seasonable retirement; pleasures of which at present you have no conception; but which, upon trial. you shall find superior to the tri∣fling, or turbulent amusements, in which you have hitherto passed your days.—The true satisfaction of the human mind is only to be found in religion and goodness; in a purified heart, and a virtuous life. All other plans of happiness are fallacious, and preg∣nant with disappointment. It is only by <HI>acquainting ourselves with God</HI> that we can <HI>find peace:</HI> And those who are <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> now, shall be <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> to the end, unless they come to him who only can <HI>give them rest.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON VI. ON <HI>LUXURY</HI> AND <HI>LICENTIOUSNESS.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH V. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of his hands.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from many passages in the writings of this prophet, that in his days great corruption of man∣ners had begun to take place among the people of Is∣rael. Originally a sober and a religious nation, ac∣customed to a simple and pastoral life, after they had enlarged their territories by conquest, and acquired wealth by commerce, they gradually contracted habits of luxury; and luxury soon introduced its usual train of attending evils. In the history of all nations, the same circulation of manners has been found; and the age in which we live resembles, in this respect, the ages which have gone before it. Forms of iniquity may vary; but the corrupt propensities of men re∣main at all times much the same; and revolutions from primitive simplicity to the refinements of crimi∣nal luxury have been often exhibited on the stage of the world. The reproof directed in the text to the Jews of that antient age, will be found equally appli∣cable to the manners of many, in modern times. In discoursing from it, I shall first consider the charac∣ter
<PB N="61" REF="028306_0066_0FD895343AC86E70"/>of those who are described in the text, and show the guilt that is involved in it. I shall next consider the duties which persons of that character are supposed to have neglected; to <HI>regard the work of the Lord, and to consider the operation of his hands.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. When we take into view the character pointed at in the text, it is evident that what the prophet means to reprove is, the spirit of inconsiderate dis∣sipation of intemperate indulgence, and irreligious luxury. It is not <HI>the feast and the wine, the harp and the viol,</HI> which he means to condemn. Music and wine are, in themselves, things of innocent nature: Nay, when temperately enjoyed, they may be em∣ployed for useful purposes; for affording relaxation from the oppressive cares of life, and for promoting friendly intercourse among men. The opulent are not prohibited from enjoying the good things of this world, which Providence has bestowed upon them. Religion neither abolishes the distinction of ranks, (as the vain philosophy of some would teach us to do,) nor interferes with a modest and decent indulgence of pleasure.—It is the criminal abuse of pleasure which is here censured; that thoughtless and intemperate enjoyment of it which wholly absorbs the time and attention of men; which obliterates every serious thought of the proper business of life; and effaces the sense of religion and of God.</P>
<P>It may be proper to remark, that it is not open and direct impiety, which is laid to the charge of the per∣sons here characterised. It is not said, that in their feasts they scoffed at religion, or blasphemed the name of God. To this summit of wickedness these persons had not yet arrived; perhaps, the age in which they lived gave not its countenance to this wantonness of impiety. It is merely a negative crime of which they are accused; that they <HI>regarded not the work of the
<PB N="62" REF="028306_0067_0FD8953680937218"/>Lord, neither considered the operation of his hands.</HI> But this absence of all religious impressions is here pointed out, as sufficient to stigmatize their characters with guilt. As soon as the sense of a Supreme Being is lost, the great check is taken off, which keeps un∣der restraint the passions of men. Mean desires, and low pleasures, take place of the greater and nobler sen∣timents which reason and religion inspire. Amidst the tumult of <HI>the wine and the feast,</HI> all proper views of human life are forgotten. The duties which, as men, they have to perform, the part they have to act in the world, and the distresses to which they are exposing themselves, are banished from their thoughts. <HI>To-morrow shall be as this day, and more abundantly,</HI> is the only voice Inflamed by society, and circula∣ted from one loose companion to another, the spirit of riot grows and swells, till it end in brutal ex∣cess.</P>
<P>Were such disorders rare and occasional merely, they might perhaps be forgotten and forgiven. But, nourished by repetition and habit, they grow up among too many, to become the business and occupa∣tion of life. By these unfortunate votaries of pleasure, they are accounted essential to happiness, life appears to stagnate without them. Having no resource within themselves, their spirits sink, and their very being seems annihilated, till the return of their favourite pleasures awaken within them some transient sparkles of joy. —Idleness, ease, and prosperity, have too natural a tendency to generate the follies and vices now describ∣ed. <HI>Because they have no changes,</HI> said the Psalmist, <HI>therefore they fear not God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lv. 19.</NOTE> They are the dark and solitary hours of life, which recal men to recollection and wisdom. They show to the unthinking what
<PB N="63" REF="028306_0068_0FD8953846200DE0"/>this world really is, and what may be expected from it. But the day that is always bright and unclouded, is not made for men. It flatters them with the dan∣gerous illusion, that it is in their power to render life one scene of pleasure; and that they have no other business on earth but to spread the <HI>feast,</HI> and call <HI>the harp and the viol</HI> to sound. But the examples are so frequent, of the dangers and the crimes which arise from an intemperate abure of pleasure, that on this part of the subject it seems needless to insist any lon∣ger. I proceed, therefore.</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the duties which men are accused of having neglected; and which, it is here supposed, if duly attended to, would have acted as the correc∣tives of dissolute and irreligious luxury; those are, to <HI>regard the work of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>consider the operation of his hands.</HI>—By recommending such duties. I do not mean to represent it as requisite that the feast should be turned into an act of worship? that the counte∣nances of men should be always grave; or that, in the hours of amusement and of social festivity, no sub∣ject may employ their thoughts and their discourse, except God and a future state. All extremes in reli∣gion are dangerous; and, by carrying austerity too far, we are in hazard of only promoting hypocrisy. But though some, in the last age, might be prone to this extreme; yet, at the present day, there is not much occasion for warning men against it.—What I now insist upon is, that all our pleasures ought to be tempered with a serious sense of God; that scenes of gaiety and enjoyment should never make us forget that we are subjects of his government, and have a part allotted us to act in his world; that on no occa∣sion they should be prolonged so much, repeated so often, or suffered to transport us so far, as to lead us to break any of the divine laws, or to act inconsist∣ently
<PB N="64" REF="028306_0069_0FD8953AFB60AF00"/>with the character of men and Christians. A prevailing sense of God on the mind is to be ever hold the surest guard of innocence and virtue, amidst the allurements of pleasure. It is the salutary mix∣ture which must be infussed into the cup of joy, in or∣der to render it safe and innoxious.</P>
<P>This sense of God should lead us, in the language of the prophet, to <HI>regard the work of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>consider the operation of his hands;</HI> which expressions may be understood as requiring us to have God up∣on our thoughts under two views: <HI>to regard his work,</HI> as the Author of nature; and <HI>to consider the operation of his hands,</HI> as the Governor of the world. Let us at∣tend more particularly to each of these views of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>In the first place, we are to view God as the Author of nature, <HI>or to regard the work of the Lord.</HI> With his works we are in every place surrounded. We can cast our eyes no where, without discerning the hand of Him who formed them, if the grossness of our minds will only allow us to behold Him. Let giddy and thoughtless men turn aside a little from the haunts of riot. Let them stand still, and contem∣plate the wondrous works of God; and make trial of the effect which such contemplation would pro∣duce. —It were good for them that, even independ∣ently of the Author, they were more acquainted with his works; good for them, that from the societies of loose and dissolute men, they would retreat to the scenes of nature; would oftener dwell among them, and enjoy their beauties. This would form them to the relish of uncorrupted, innocent pleasures; and make them feel the va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue of calm enjoyments, as su∣perior to the noise and turbulence of licen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious gaiety. From the harmony of nature, and of nature's works, they would learn to hear sweeter sounds than what arises from <HI>the viol, the tabret, and the pipe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="028306_0070_0FD8953C7AEFD848"/>
But to higher and more serious thoughts these works of nature give occasion, when considered in conjunc∣tion with the Creator who made them.—Let me call on you, my friends, to catch some interval of reflec∣tion, some serious moment, for looking with thought∣ful eye on the world around you. Lift your view to that immense arch of heaven which encompasses you above. Behold the sun in all his splendor rolling over your head by day; and the moon, by night, in mild and serene majesty, surrounded with that host of stars which present to your imagination an innumerable multitude of worlds. Listen to the awful voice of thunder. Listen to the roar of the tempest and the ocean. Survey the wonders that fill the earth which you inhabit. Contemplate a steady and powerful Hand, bringing round spring and summer, autumn and winter, in regular course; decorating this earth with innumerable beauties, diversifying it with in∣numerable inhabitants; pouring forth comforts on all that live; and, at the same time, overawing the nations with the violence of the elements, when it pleases the Creator to let them forth.—After you have viewed yourselves as surrounded with such a scene of wonders; after you have beheld on every hand, such an astonishing display of majesty united with wisdom and goodness; are you not seized with solemn and serious awe? Is there not something which whispers you within, that to this great Creator reverence and homage are due by all the rational beings whom he has made? Admitted to be spectators of his works, placed in the midst of so many great and interesting objects, can you believe that you were brought hither for no purpose, but to immerse yourselves in gross and brutal, or, at best, in tristing pleasures; lost to all sense of the wonders you behold; lost to all reverence of that God who gave you being, and who has crect∣ed
<PB N="66" REF="028306_0071_0FD8953E00118078"/>this amazing fabric of nature, on which you look only with stupid and unmeaning eyes?—No: Let the scenes which you behold prompt correspondent feelings. Let them awaken you from the degrading intoxication of licentiousness, into nobler emoti∣ons. Every object which you view in nature, whe∣ther great or small, serves to instruct you. The star and the insect, the fiery meteor and the flower of spring, the verdant field and the lofty mountain, all exhibit a supreme Power, before which you ought to tremble and adore; all preach the doctrine, all inspire the spirit, of dovotion, and reverence. <HI>Re∣garding,</HI> then, <HI>the work of the Lord,</HI> let rising emo∣tions of awe and gratitude call forth from your fouls such sentiments as these:— <Q>Lord, wherever I am and whatever I enjoy, may I never forget thee, as the Author of nature! May I never forget that I am thy creature and thy subject! In this magni∣ficent temple of the universe, where thou hast pla∣ced me, may I ever be thy faithful worshipper; and may the reverence and the fear of God be the first sentiments of my heart!</Q>—It is to such con∣sideration of God I would now recal your thoughts, from the <HI>wine and the feast,</HI> as proper to check the spirit of levity and folly; and to inspire manly and becoming sentiments, in the place of criminal dissi∣pation. But,</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, there is a consideration of a nature still more serious, to be employed for the same purpose; the consideration of God as not only the Author of nature, but the Governor of his creatures. While we <HI>regard the work of the Lord,</HI> we are also to <HI>consider the</HI> never ceasing <HI>operation of his hands.</HI> We are to look up to an awful and irresistible Providence, stretching its arm over our heads; directing the fate of men, and dispensing at its pleasure happiness or
<PB N="67" REF="028306_0072_0FD8953F7A713650"/>misery. In the giddy moments of jollity, the wan∣ton and thoughtless are apt to say: <Q><HI>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</HI> Nothing is better for man, than to rejoice as much as he can all the days of his vain life; and to keep himself undisturbed by superstitious terrors. He who sitteth in the hea∣vens bestows no minute attention on the sons of earth. He permits <HI>all things to come alike to all; one event to happen to the righteous and to the wicked.</HI></Q>— Be assured, my brethren, it is not so. You greatly de∣ceive yourselves, by imagining that your Creator and Governor is indifferent to the part you are now act∣ing; or that the distribution of good and evil, which now takes place, has no relation to your moral con∣duct. In some instances, that relation may not be apparent, because the moral government of God is not complete in this world. But a multitude of proofs show government to be already begun; and point out to you the train in which you may expect it to pro∣ceed.</P>
<P>In the history of all ages and nations, you cannot but have observed a thousand instances, in which <HI>the operation of the divine hand</HI> has been displayed; over∣taking evil doers sooner or later with punishment, and bringing on their own heads the ruin they had devis∣ed for others. You are not to imagine that this dis∣pleasure of Providence is exerted only against the am∣bitious, the treacherous, and the cruel, who are the authors of extensive misery to the world. Under this idea, perhaps, you may be desirous to shelter your∣selves, that your excesses are of a harmless kind; that you seek nothing more than the enjoyment of your own pleasures; that your <HI>feast</HI> and your <HI>wine</HI> interfere not with the order of the world; and that therefore you have done nothing which should awaken the sleeping thunder, and bring it dow from heaven on your heads.
<PB N="68" REF="028306_0073_0FD8955D94850570"/>Though not stained with the blackest colour of guilt, your conduct may nevertheless be highly offensive to the Ruler of the world. His government is not of that indolent inattentive kind, which allows impun∣ity to every lesser criminal. He beholds with displea∣sure the behaviour of those who degrade their nature by vitious disorders; and contaminate, by their example, every society with which they are connect∣ed. His measures are taken, that in one way or other, they shall suffer.</P>
<P>Look around the circle of your acquaintance, and observe, whether they are not the sober, the industri∣ous, and the virtuous, who visibly prosper in the world, and rise into reputation and influence; observe whether the licentious and intemperate are not con∣stantly humbled and checked by some dark reverse either in their health or their fortune; whether the irreligious and profligate are ever suffered to escape long, without being marked with infamy, and be∣coming objects of contempt.—I ask, to what cause this is to be ascribed, but to that <HI>operation of the hand of God,</HI> which I am now calling you to consider? Does it not obviously carry the marks of a plan, a system of things, contrived and fore-ordained by Prov∣idence, for rewarding virtue, and punishing vice in every form of its disorders?—The Governor of the world need not for this purpose step from his throne, or put forth his hand from the clouds, With ad∣mirable wisdom he hath so ordered the train of hu∣man affairs, that, in their natural course, men's <HI>own wickedness shall reprove them, and their back slidings cor∣rect them; that they shall be made to eat the fruit of their doings, and to fall into the pit which themselves had dig∣ged.</HI></P>
<P>These things have been always so apparent to obser∣vation, that though a man may have been seduced into irregular and evil courses during his life, yet, at the close
<PB N="69" REF="028306_0074_0FD895667A57A758"/>of it, it seldom happens but he discerns their pernicious nature, and condemns himself for them. Never, per∣haps, was there a father, who after he had spent his days in idleness, dissipation, and luxury, did not. when dying, admonish the children whom he loved, to hold a more honourable course, to follow the paths of virtue, to fear God, and to fulfil properly the du∣ties of their station.—To yourselves, indeed, I can confidently appeal, whether what I am now saying, be not confirmed by your own testimony. After you have been guilty of some criminal acts, in the course of those riotous pleasures which you indulge, have you not at certain times, felt the stings of remorse? Were you not obliged to confess to yourselves that a sad pros∣pect of misery was opening before you, if such ex∣cesses were to continue? Did you not hear an inward voice upbraiding you for having sunk and degraded your character so far below that of many of your equals around you?—My friends, what was this but the voice of God, speaking, as the Govenor of his creatures, within your heart; testifying loudly that your course of life was displeasing to him; and war∣ning you of punishments that were to follow? If his displeasure against you is already begun to be testified, can you tell where it is to stop, or how long it may continue to pursue you throughout future stages of your existence? <HI>Who knoweth the power of his wrath?</HI> —To this awful, this warring voice, will you not be persuaded reverently to listen! Impressed by the dread authority which it carries, shall you not fall down on your knees before your Maker, imploring his mer∣cy to pardon your past offences, and his grace to rect∣ify your future way?</P>
<P>Such ought to be the effects of the consideration of God as the Governor of the world. It leads to thoughts of a very serious nature. When we <HI>regard
<PB N="70" REF="028306_0075_0FD87F3EDEF5D3B8"/>the work of the Lord,</HI> and contemplate him as the Au∣thor of the universe, such contemplation prompts de∣votion. But when we <HI>consider the operation of his hands</HI> in providence, and contemplate him as the Govenor of mankind, such contemplation prompts humiliation before him for offences committed. The former ad∣dresses itself to the ingenuous sentiments that are left in the heart; and awakens a sense of our unworthi∣ness, in neglecting the Author of nature, amidst our riotous pleasures. The latter addresses itself to our regard for safety and happiness; and awakens fear and dread, from conciousness of the guilt we have con∣tracted. Hence springs up in every thoughtful mind an anxious concern to avert the displeasure, and re∣gain the favour of that Supreme Being to whom we are all subject. This, among unenlightened nations, gave rise to sacrifices, expiations, and all the rites of hum∣ble, though superstitious worship. Among nations who have been instructed in true religion, sentiments of the same nature pave the way for prayer, repen∣tance, faith, and all those duties, by means of which we may hope, through a divine Mediator and inter∣cessor, to be reconciled to heaven. Natural and re∣vealed religion here appear in concord. We behold the original dictates of the human heart laying a foundation for the glad reception of the comfortable tidings of the gospel.</P>
<P>I have thus endeavoured to show in what manner, by <HI>regarding the work of the Lord, and considering the operation of his hands,</HI> we may prevent the dangers aris∣ing from a thoughtless indulgence of pleasure; we may be furnished with an antidote to the poison which is too often mixed in that intoxicating cup.—Human life is full of troubles. We are all tempted to allevi∣ate them as much as we can, by freely enjoying the pleasurable moments which Providence thinks fit to
<PB N="71" REF="028306_0076_0FD89540FA1120A8"/>allow us. Enjoy them we may: But, if we would enjoy them safely, and enjoy them long, let us tem∣per them with the fear of God. As soon as this is forgotten and obliterated, the sound of <HI>the harp and the viol</HI> is changed into the signal of death. The ser∣pent comes forth from the roses where it had lain in ambush, and gives the fatal sting. Pleasure in mo∣deration is the cordial, in excess it is the bane, of life.</P>

<P>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: In thy presence is ful∣ness of joy: at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apostle Peter, in a discourse which he held to the Jews, applies this passage, in a mystical and prophetical sense, to the Messiah.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 25, 28.</NOTE> But, in its literal and primitive meaning, it expresses the exalted hopes by which the Psalmist David supported him∣self amidst the changes and revolutions, of which his life was full. By these hopes, when flying before Saul, when driven from his throne, and persecuted
<PB N="72" REF="028306_0077_0FD895433A0D9A50"/>by an unnatural son, he was enabled to preserve his virtue, and to maintain unshaken trust in God.—In that early age of the world, those explicit discoveries of a state of immortality, which we enjoy, had not yet been given to mankind. But though the <HI>Sun of righ∣teousness</HI> was not arisen, the dawn had appeared of that glorious day which he was to introduce. Even in those antient times, holy men, as the apostle writes to the Hebrews, <HI>saw the promises afar off, and were persuad∣ed of them and embraced them; and confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth, declared that they saught after a better country, that is an heavenly.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi 13, 16.</NOTE> Indeed in every age, God permitted such hopes to afford support and consolation to those who served him. The full effect of them we behold in those triumphant expressions of the text, which are to be the subject of this discourse. They lead us to consider; first, The hope of the Psalmist in his present state; <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of life.</HI> And, secondly, the termi∣nation of his hope in that future state, where <HI>in the pre∣sence of God is fulness of joy, and at his right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of life.</HI> This plainly imports that there are different <HI>paths</HI> or courses of con∣duct, which may be pursued by men in this world; a path which leads to life or happiness, and a path which issues in death or destruction. These opposite lines of conduct are determined by the choice which men make of virtue or of vice; and hence men are divided into two great classes, according as their in∣clinations lead them to good or to evil. <HI>The path of life</HI> is often a rough and difficult path, followed only by a few. The opposite one is the broad way, in which the multitude walk; seemingly smooth, and
<PB N="73" REF="028306_0078_0FD89544BB4683C8"/>strewed with flowers; but leading in the end to death and misery. <HI>The path of life</HI> conducts us up a steep ascent. The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been represented as placed on the summit of a hill; in the ascent of which labour is requisite, and difficulties are to be surmounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our steps.</P>
<P>Now, the hope which good men entertain is, that this <HI>path of life</HI> shall be shewn them by God; that, when their intentions are upright, God will both in∣struct them concerning the road which leads to true happiness, and will assist them to pursue it successful∣ly. Among nations where any suitable ideas of God or of virtue began to be formed, hopes of this nature also began to be entertained. It was consonant to the nature of man, to think that the Supreme Being was favourable to virtue. Accordingly, in the writings of some of the ancient philosophers, we find various obscure traces of this belief, that there was a benign heavenly spirit, who illuminated the minds of the vir∣tuous, and assisted their endeavours to obtain wisdom and happiness. They even asserted, that no man be∣came great or good without some inspiration of hea∣ven.</P>
<P>But what they indistinctly conceived, and could not with confidence rely upon, the doctrine of Christi∣anity hath clearly explained and fully confirmed; expressly and frequently teaching that, not only by the external discoveries of revelation, but by the in∣ward operations of his Spirit, he <HI>shows</HI> to the humble and virtuous the <HI>path of life.</HI> While, by his word, he instructs them in their duty, by the influence of his grace he assists them in the performance of it. In all revelation there is certainly no doctrine more comfortable than this. It is to good men a noble and pleasing thought, that they are pursuing a path which
<PB N="74" REF="028306_0079_0FD89547002BB768"/>God has discovered and pointed out to them. For they know that every path, in which he is their conduc∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, must be honourable, must be safe, must bring them in the end to felicity. They follow that <HI>shepherd of Israel,</HI> who always leads his flock in∣to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reen pastures, and makes them lie down beside the still waters.</HI> At the same time, they know that, if there be truth in religion at all, on this principle they may securely rest, that the Divine Being will ne∣ver desert those who are endeavouring to follow out, as they can, the path which he has shewn them. He beholds them here in a state of great imbecillity; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn unded with much darkness; exposed to num∣berless dangers, from the temptations that assault them without, and the seduction of misguided and disorderly passions within. In this situation, can they ever suspect that the Father of mercies will leave his servants, alone and unbefriended, to struggle up the hill of virtue, without stretching forth a compassion∣ate arm to aid their frailty, and to guide them through the bewild<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring paths of life? Where were then the <HI>God of love?</HI> Where those infinite compassions of his nature, in which all his worshippers have been en∣couraged to trust? — No: He will <HI>send forth his light and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is truth to bring them to his holy hill,</HI> For <HI>the righte∣ous Lord loveth righteousness, and his countenance be∣holdeth the upright.</HI> With him there is no ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ique purpose, to turn him aside from favouring the cause of goodness. No undertaking to which he has giv∣en his countenance shall prove abortive. No pro∣mise that he has made shall be allowed to fail. Whom he loveth, <HI>he loveth to the end. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his cov∣enant. The meek will he guide in judgment, and them winde teach his way. His grace shall be sufficient for them, and his strength be made perfect in their weakness. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from strength to strength; every one of them ap∣peareth

Psalm lxxxiv. 7.</NOTE> —Such are the hopes with which good men in a present life set forth on a course of piety and virtue. <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of life.</HI> Let us now proceed.</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the termination of these hopes in a future state. <HI>In thy presence is fulness of joy: at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</HI> All hap∣piness assuredly dwells with God The <HI>fountain of life</HI> is justly said to be <HI>with him.</HI> That supreme and in∣dependent Being must necessarily possess within him∣self every principle of beati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de; and no cause from without can possibly affect his untroubled felicity. Among created dependent beings, happiness flows in scattered and fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble streams; streams that are often tinged with the blackness of misery. But from be∣fore the throne of God issues the river of life, full, unmixed, and pure; and the pleasures which now in scanty portions we are permitted to tuste, are all derived from that source. Whatever gladdens the hearts of men or angels, with any real and satis∣factory joy. come from heaven It is a portion of the <HI>pure influence flowing from the glory of the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mighty;</HI> a ray <HI>iss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung from the brightness of the everlasting life.</HI> It is manifest, therefore, that every approach to God must be an approach to felicity. The enjoyment of his immediate presence must be the consummation of felicity; and it is to this presence that the Psalm∣ist here expresses his hope that the <HI>path of life</HI> was to conduct him.</P>
<P>The whole of what is implied in arriving at the pre∣sence of the Divinity, we cannot expect to compre∣hend. Such expressions as these of scripture, <HI>behold∣ing the face of God; being made glad with the right of his countenance, and satisfied with his likeness; seeing
<PB N="76" REF="028306_0081_0FD8954AB9FD0820"/>light in his light; seeing no longer darkly as through a glass, but face to face; seeing him as he is;</HI> are expres∣sions altogether mysterious, conveying sublime tho' obscure ideas of the most perfect happiness and high∣est exaltation of human nature. This we know, that the absence of God, the distance at which we are now placed from any communication with our Creator, is one great source of our infelicity. Faith exerts its endeavours, but often ineffectually, to raise our souls to him. He is a <HI>God that hideth himself.</HI> His ways seem intricate and perplexed. We frequently can∣not reconcile them to the conceptions which we had formed of his nature; and with many a suspicion and doubt they perplex the inquiring mind. His works we survey with astonishment. We wonder and adore. But while we clearly trace the footsteps of their great Author, his presence we can never discern. <HI>We go forward, but he is not there; and bachward, but we cannot perceive him: on the left hand, where he work∣eth, but we cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that we cannot see him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE> Hence amidst the various sorrows and discouragements of the present state, that exclamation of Job's is often drawn forth from the pious heart, <HI>O that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Surrounded by such distressing obscurity, no hope more transporting can be open to a good man, than that a period is to come, when he shall be allowed to draw nearer to the Author of his existence, and to enjoy the sense of his presence. In order to convey some faint idea of that future bliss, by such an image as we can now employ, let the image be taken from the most glorious representative of the Supreme Be∣ing, with which we are acquainted in this world, the
<PB N="77" REF="028306_0082_0FD87F404547BEE0"/>Sun in the heavens. As that resplendent luminary cheers and revives the universe, when after the dark∣ness of a tempestuous night, it comes forth in the morning with its brightest lustre, and inspires every heart with gladness; as ascending gradually through the heavens, it converts that whole vast extent over which its beams are diffused, into a region of light; and thus changes entirely the state of objects, by ar∣raying all nature in beauty, and transforming it into the image of its own brightness:—Some such change as this, though in a degree infinitely superior, we may conceive the revelation of the Divine Presence to produce upon the human soul. <HI>I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.</HI>—But without endeavouring farther to unsold mysteries which we cannot explore▪ there are two sublime and expressive views of the Divine Essence given us in scripture, on which it may be ed∣ifying that our thoughts should rest for a little, in or∣der to aid our conceptions of the blessedness of good men hereafter, in the presence of God. It is said, <HI>God is light.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 5.</NOTE> <HI>God is love</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8.</NOTE> Let us consider what <HI>fulness of joy</HI> must arise from such manifestations of the Divine Essence to the blessed.</P>
<P><HI>God is light.</HI> The revelation of his presence, infers of course, a complete diffusion of light and knowledge among all who partake of that pre∣sence. This unquestionably forms a primary in∣gredient of happiness. Ignorance. or the want of light, is the source of all our present misconduct, and all our misfortunes. The heart of man is dark; and in the darkness of his heart is the seat of his cor∣ruption. He is unable to discern what is truly good. Perpetually employed in search of happiness, he is
<PB N="78" REF="028306_0083_0FD8954C3A432170"/>perpetually misled by false appearances of it. The errors of his understanding impose upon his passions; and, in consequence of the wrong direction which his passions take, he is betrayed into a thousand disorders. Hence sensuality, covetousness and all the violent contests with others about trifles, which occasion so much misery, and so many crimes in the world. <HI>He feedeth of ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xliv. 20.</NOTE>?—Once open to him the perfect sources of knowledge and truth; suppose him placed in the presence of that God who is <HI>Light;</HI> suppose him illuminated by light derived immediately from the Supreme Being; presently all his former errors would fly away, as mists are dispel∣led by the rising sun. His whole nature would be changed and reformed. The prejudices which ob∣scured his understanding would be removed. The se∣ductions of his passions would disappear. Rectitude and virtue, having nothing now to obstruct their en∣trance, would take entire possession of his heart. Angels are happier than men, because they enjoy more enlarged knowledge and views; because they labour under none of our unhappy deceptions; but see the truth as it is in itself; see it, as it is in God. Sharing the same light which illuminates them, good men in a future state will share in their felicity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the light that stows from the presence of Him who is the original source of light, not only ban∣ishes miseries which were the effects of former dark∣ness, but also confers the most exquisite enjoyment. The knowledge afforded us at present serves to sup∣ply our most pressing wants; but it does no more. It is always imperfect and unsatisfactory; nay, much

What must it be to behold the whole stupendous scene of nature unveiled, and its hidden mysteries dis∣closed! To trace the wise and just government of the Almighty, through all those intricacies which had so long perplexed us! To behold his hand conducting ten thousand worlds, which are now unknown to us; and throughout all the regions of boundless space, to view wisdom and goodness perpetually acting, and diversifying its operations in forms of endless variety! Well may such discoveries inspire that song of the blessed, which the apostle John heard <HI>as the voice of of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying.

Hence follows the entire purification of human na∣ture from all those malevolent passions, which have so long rendered our abode on earth the abode of mise∣ry. We greatly deceive ourselves, when we charge our cheif distresses merely to the account of our exter∣nal condition in the world. From the disadvantages attending it, I admit, that we may often have been exposed to suffer. We may have met with disappoint∣ments in our pursuits. By the arrows of misfortune we may have been wounded. Under infirmities of body we may have languished. But on this we may depend, that the worst evils of our present condition arise from the want of goodness and love; from the disorders of selfish passions: from the irritation which these occasion when working within ourselves, and the distresses which they produce when braking out upon us from others; in a word, from that corrupt∣ed state of temper, and that reciprocation of jealousies, suspicions, and injuries, which is ever taking place among the societies of men. Could you banish dis∣trust, craft, and uncharitableness, from the earth, and form all mankind into an assembly of the just and the benevolent; could you inspire every heart with kind affections, and render every one friendly and ge∣nerous to his neighbour; you would banish at once the most afflictive tribe of human evils. Seldom would the voice of complaint be heard. All nature would assume a different aspect. Cheerfulness would be seen on every countenance. Paradise would re∣turn. The wilderness would smile: <HI>the desa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t rejoice and blossom as the rose.</HI>—Now such are the effects which the presence of the God of love must produce on the inhabitants above. <HI>Beholding his glory, they are changed into the same image.</HI> In that temple of eternal love, which his presence has hallowed and consecra∣ted, no sound but the voice of harmony is ever heard;
<PB N="81" REF="028306_0086_0FD8955186984738"/>no appearances ever present themselves but those of peace and joy.</P>
<P>Thus, considering God under these two illustri∣ous characters which are given of him in scripture, as, <HI>light</HI> and as <HI>love,</HI> it follows that in his presence there must be <HI>fulness of joy.</HI> But I am far from say∣ing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e few imperfect hints I have now given, exhaust, or even approach to, the sum of those <HI>plea∣sures for evermore which are at God's right hand.</HI> Ten thousand pleasures are there, which now we have neither faculties to comprehend, nor powers to enjoy. Behind that mysterious cloud, which covers the habi∣tation of eternity, the view of mortals connot pene∣trate. Content with our humble and distant situa∣tion, we must as yet remain. Faith can only look to those glories from afar. In patient silence, It must wait, turst, and adore.</P>
<P>Supposing the ideas which I have set before you in this discourse, to be no more than they speculati∣ons of a contemplative mind, such as were wont of old to be indulged by the philosophers of the Platonic school, still they would deserve attention, on account of their tendency to purify and elevate the mind. But when they are considered in counection with a revelation, which, upon grounds the most unquestion∣able, we believe to be divine, they are entitled to com∣mand, not attention only, but reverence and faith.—They present to us such high expectations are are suf∣ficient to determine every reasonable man to the choice of virtue to support him under all its present discour∣agements, and to comfort him in the hour of death. Justly may they excite in our hearts that ardent aspi∣ration of the Psalmist, <HI>My soul thirsteth for God for the living God; O when shall I come and appear before him</HI>—But, with this wish in our hearts, never I beseech you, let us forget what was set forth in the
<PB N="82" REF="028306_0087_0FD895530022A330"/>first part of this discourse; that, in order to arrive at the presence of God, the <HI>path of life</HI> must previously be shewn to us by him, and that in this path we must persevere to the end. These two things cannot be disjoined, a virtuous life and a happy eter∣nity. <HI>Who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? He ony who hath clean hands and a pure heart.</HI> Between a corrupted heart and the God of light and love, there never can be any connection. But of this we may rest assured, that the path of piety and virtue, pursued with a firm and constant spirit, will, in the end, through the merits of our blessed Redeemer, bring us to that presence, where <HI>is fulness of joy, and where are pleasures for ever∣more.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON VIII. ON <HI>CURIOSITY</HI> CONCERNING THE <HI>AFFAIRS</HI> OF OTHERS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN XXI. 21, 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words occurred in a conference which our Lord held with Simon Peter, after his resurrection from the dead. Conscious of the dis∣grace which he had incurred by his late denial of his
<PB N="83" REF="028306_0088_0FD895547B713D48"/>Master, Peter must at this time have appeared before him with shame. Our Lord, after a tacit rebuke, implied in the question which the repeatedly puts to him, <HI>Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me?</HI> restores him, with great benignity, to his office as an apostle, by giving the commandment to <HI>feed his sheep;</HI> and intimates also that it should be his lot to suffer death in the cause of his master. The apostle John, dis∣tinguished here by the denomination of <HI>the disciple whom Jesus loved,</HI> being present at this conversation, Peter, who was always eager and forward, looking to John, puts this question to our Saviour, <HI>Lord, and what shall this man do?</HI> <Q>What shall be his em∣ployment? what his rank and station in thy king∣dom? what his future fate in life?</Q>—By what prin∣ciple Peter was moved to put this unseasonable and improper question to his Master; whether it arose from mere curiosity, of from some emotion of rival∣ship and jealousy, does not appear; but it is plain that our Lord was dissatisfied with the inquiry which he made; and presently he checks Peter's curiosity, by a severe reply; <HI>What is that to thee?</HI> <Q>What is it to thee what <HI>this man shall do;</HI> what shall be his rank; or what the circumstances of his life or his death? Attend thou to thine own duty. Mind thy proper concerns. Fulfil the part which I have allotted to thee. <HI>Follow thou me.</HI></Q>—The instruction which ari∣ses from this conversation of our Lord's with Peter, is, That all prying inquiries into the state, circum∣stances, or character of others, are reprehensible and improper; that to every man a particular charge is assigned by his Lord and Master, the fulfillment of which ought to be the primary object of his attention, without officiously thrusting himself into the concerns of others. The illustration of these points shall make the subject of the present discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="028306_0089_0FD8955605FED9E0"/>
That idle curiosity, that inquisitive and meddling spirit, which leads men to pry into the affairs of their neighbours, is reprehensible on three accounts. It interrupts the good order, and breakes the peace of so∣ciety. It brings forward and nourishes several bad passions. It draws men aside from a proper attention to the discharge of their own duty.</P>
<P>It interrupts, I say, the order, and breaks the peace of society. In this world we are linked together by many ties We are bound by duty, and we are prompt∣ed by interest, to give mutal assistance, and to per∣form friendly offices to each other. But those friend∣ly offices are performed to most advantage, when we avoid to interfere unnecessarily in the concerns of our neighbour. Every man has his own part to act, has his own interest to consult, has affairs of his own to manage, which his neighbour has no call to scrutin∣ize. Human life then proceeds in its most natural and orderly train, when every one keeps within the bounds of his proper province; when, as long at his pursuits are fair and lawful, he is allowed, without disturbance, to conduct them in his own way. <HI>That ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess vi. 11.</NOTE> is the apostolical rule, and indeed the great rule, for preservation of harmony and order. But so it is, that in every age, a set of men have existed, who, driven by an unhappy activity of spirit, oftner perhaps than by any settled design of doing ill, or any motives of ambition or interest, love to intermeddle where they have no concern, to inquire into the private affairs of others, and from the imperfect information which they collect, to form conclusions concerning their circumstances and character. These are they who in scripture, are characterised as <HI>tūtlers, and busy
<PB N="85" REF="028306_0090_0FD89557D4201598"/>bodies in other mens matters,</HI> and from whom we are called to <HI>turn away.</HI></P>
<P>Though persons of this description should be prompted by nothing but vain curiosity, they are, ne∣vertheless, dangerous troublers of the world. While they conceive themselves to be inoffensive, they are sowing dissension and feuds. Crossing the lines in which others move, they create confusion, and awak∣en resentment. For every man conceives himself to be injured, when he finds another intruding in to his af∣fairs, and, without any title, taking upon him to exam∣ine his conduct. Being improperly and unnecessari∣ly disturbed, he claims the right of disturbing in his turn those who wantonly have troubled him. Hence, many a friendship has been broken; the peace of ma∣ny a family has been overthrown; and much bitter and lasting discord has been propagated through society.</P>
<P>While this spirit of meddling curiosity injures so considerably the peace and good order of the world, it also nourishes, among individuals who are addicted to it, a multitude of bad passions. Its most frequent source is mere idleness, which, in itself a vice, never fails to engender many vices more. The mind of man cannot be long without some food to nourish the activity of its thoughts. The idle, who have no nourishment of this sort within themselves, feed their thoughts with inquiries into the conduct of their neighbours. The inquisitive and curious are always talkative. What they learn, or fancy themselves to have learned, concerning others, they are generally in haste to divulge. A tale which the malicious have invented, and the credulous have propagated; a ru∣mour which, arising among the multitude, and trans∣mitted by one to another, has, in every step of its pro∣gress gained fresh additions, becomes in the end the
<PB N="86" REF="028306_0091_0FD8955A803D3BC8"/>foundation of confident assertion, and of rash and se∣vere judgment.</P>
<P>It is often by a spirit of jealousy and rivalry, that the researches of such persons are prompted. They wish to discover something that will bring down their neighbour's character, circumstances, or reputation, to the level of their own; or that will flatter them with an opinion of their own superiority. A secret malignity lies at the bottom of their inquiries. It may be concealed by an affected show of candour and impartiality. It may even be veiled with the appearance of friendly concern for the interests of oth∣ers, and with affected apologies for their failings. But the hidden rancour is easily discovered.—While, therefore persons of this description trouble the peace of society, they at the same time poison their own minds with malignant passions. Their disposition is entirely the reverse of that amiable spirit of charity, on which our religion lays so great a stress. Charity <HI>co∣vereth the multitude of sins;</HI> but this prying and med∣dling spirit seeks to discover and divulge them. Cha∣rity <HI>thinketh no evil;</HI> but this temper inclines us al∣ways to suspect the worst. Charity <HI>rejoiceth not in in∣iquity:</HI> this temper triumphs in the discovery of errors and failings. Charity like the sun, brightens every object on which it shines; a censorious disposition casts every character into the darkest shade it will bear.</P>
<P>It is to be farther observed, that all impertinent curiosity about the affairs of others tends greatly to obstruct personal reformation; as it draws mens thoughts aside from what ought to be the chief ob∣ject of attention, the improvement of their own heart and life. They who are so officiously occupied about their neighbours, have little leisure, and less inclina∣tion, to observe their own defects, or to mind their
<PB N="87" REF="028306_0092_0FD8955C070B96C0"/>own duty. From their inquisitive researches, they find, or imagine they find, in the behaviour of others, an apology for their own failings: And the favour∣ite result of their inquiries generally is, to rest satis∣fied with themselves. They are at least as good, they think, as others around them. The condemnation which they pass on the vices of their neighbours, they interpret to be a sentiment of virtue in them∣selves. They become those hypocrites described by our Lord, who see clearly <HI>the more that is in their neighbour's eye, while they disern not the beam that is in their own.</HI></P>
<P>In opposition to such a character as this, the doc∣trine plainly inculcated by the text is, that to every man a particular charge is given by his Lord and Master, a part is assigned him by Providence to act; that to this he ought to bend his chief attention; and, instead of scrutinising the character or state of others, ought to think of himself, and leave them to stand or fail by their own master. <HI>What shall this man do?</HI> said Peter <HI>What,</HI> replies our Lord, <HI>is that to thee? Follow thou me.</HI></P>
<P>Where persons possess any important station, or distinguished rank, in the world, the application of this doctrine to them is manifest. It they have any candour, they cannot refuse to acknowledge that God and the world have a title to expect from them a dil∣igent attention to their proper part in life; and that to waste their time in idle inquiries about others, with whom they have nothing to do, is reprehensible and sinful. But there are multitudes of mankind, to whom this appears in a very different light. They are humble and private men, who are willing to con∣ceive themselves as of little importance in the world. Having no extensive influence, and no call, as they think, to distinguish themselves by active exertions
<PB N="88" REF="028306_0093_0FD87F38E0D476F8"/>in any sphere, they imagine that they may innocent∣ly lead an idle life, and indulge their curiosity, by canvassing at pleasure the character and the behaviour of those around them. With persons of this descrip∣tion every society too much abounds.—My brethren, no one ought to consider himself as insignificant in the sight of God. In our several stations we are all sent forth to be labourers in God's vineyard. Every man has his work allotted, his talent committed to him; by the due improvement of which he might, in one way or other, serve God, promote virtue, and be useful in the world. <HI>Occupy till I come,</HI> is the charge given to all Christians without exception. To be entirely unemployed and idle is the prerogative of no one, in any rank of life.</P>
<P>Even that sex, whose task is not to mingle in the labours of public and active business, have their own part assigned them to act. In the quiet of domestic shade, there are a variety of virtues to be exercised, and of important duties to be discharged. Much de∣pends on them for the maintenance of private econ∣omy and order, for the education of the young, and for the relief and comfort of those whose functions engaged them in the toils of the world. Even where no such female duties occur to be performed, the care of preparing for future usefulness, and of at∣taining such accomplishments as procure just esteem, is laudable. In such duties and cares, how far better is time employed, than in that search into private concerns, that circulation of rumours, those discus∣sions of the conduct and descants on the character of others, which engross conversation so much, and which end, for the most part, in severity of censure!</P>
<P>In whatever condition we are placed, to act always in character should be our constant rule. He who acts in character is above contempt though his station
<PB N="89" REF="028306_0094_0FD8955EFAF1B8C0"/>be low. He who acts out of character is despicable, though his station be ever so high. <HI>What is that to thee,</HI> what this man or that man does? Think of what thou oughtest to do thyself; of what is suitable to thy character and place; of what the world has a title to expect from thee. Every excursion of vain curi∣osity about others, is a subtraction from that time and thought which was due to ourselves and due to God. <HI>Having gifts,</HI> says the Apostle Paul <HI>differing according to the grace that is given us, whether ministry let us wait on our ministring; or he that teacheth on teach∣ing; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that giveth let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom xii. 6.9.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the great circle of human affairs there is room for every one to be busy and well employed in his own pro∣vince, without encroaching upon that of others. It is the province of superiors, to direct; of inferiors, to obey; of the learned to be instructive; of the ignorant, to be docile; of the old to be communicative; of the young to be adviseable and diligent. Art thou poor? Show thyself active and industrious, peaceable and contented. Art thou wealthy? Show thyself benefi∣cent and charitable, condescending and humane. If thou livest much in the world, it is thy duty to make the light of a good example shine conspicuously be∣fore others. If thou livest private and retired, it is thy business to improve thine own mind, and to add, if thou canst do no more, one faithful subject to the Messiah's kingdom. There is indeed no man so se∣questered from active life, but within his own narrow sphere he may find some opportunities of doing good; of cultivating friendship, promoting peace, and dis∣charging
<PB N="90" REF="028306_0095_0FD895607B87C6D0"/>many of these lesser offices of humanity and kindness, which are within the reach of every one, and which we all owe to one onother. In all the va∣rious relations which subsist among us in life, as husband and wife, master and servants, parents and children, relations and friends, rulers and subjects, innumerable duties stand ready to be performed; innumerable calls to virtuous activity present them∣selves on every hand, sufficient to fill up with advan∣tage and honour the whole time of man.</P>
<P>There is, in particular, one great and compre∣hensive object of attention, which, in the text, is placed in direct opposition to that idle curiosity repre∣hended by our Lord; that is, to follow Christ. <HI>Fol∣low thou me.</HI> What this man or that man does; how he employs his time; how he succeeds in the world; are matters concerning which the information we re∣ceive can never be of great importance to us; often, is of no importance at all. But how our Saviour behaved while he was on earth, or how, in our situa∣tion, he would have behaved, are matters of the high¦est moment to every Christian.</P>
<P>The commandment given in the text to <HI>follow him,</HI> includes both observance of his words, and imitation of his example. The words of Christ contain, as we all know, the standing rule of our life. His exam∣ple exhibits the great model on which our conduct ought to be formed and it is to this that the precept here delivered directly refers.—Examples have great influence on all. But by all human examples, we are in danger of being occasionally misled. We are ever obliged to be on our guard, lest the admira∣tion of what is estimable, betray us into a resemb∣lance of what is blemished and faulty. For the most perfect human characters, in the midst of their bright∣ness
<PB N="91" REF="028306_0096_0FD89561F9DC39B0"/>and beauty, are always marked with some of those dark spots which stains the nature of man. But our Lord possessed all the virtues of the greatest and best men, without partaking any of their defects. In him, all was light without a shade, and beauty with∣out a stain.—At the same time, his example is at∣tended with this singular advantage, of being more accommodated than any other to general immitation. It was distinguished by no unnatural austerities, no affected singularities; but exhibits the plain and sim∣ple tenor of all those virtues for which we have most frequent occasion in ordinary life. In order to ren∣der it of more universal benefit, our Lord fixed his residence in no particular place; he tied himself down to no particular calling or way of liv∣ing; but gives us the opportunity or viewing his be∣haviour, in that variety of lights which equally and indifferently rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll mankind. His life was divid∣ed between the retired and the active state. Devoti∣on and business equally shared it. In the discharge of that high office with which he was vested, we be∣hold the perfect model of a public character; and we behold the most beautiful example of private life, when we contemplate him among his disciples, as a Father in the midst of his family.—By such means he has exhibited before us specimens of every kind of virtue; and to all ranks and classes of men has afford∣ed a pattern after which they may copy. Hardly is there any emergency which can occur in life, but from some incident in our Saviour's conduct, from some feature displayed in his character, we are ena∣bled to say to ourselves, <Q>Thus Christ would have spoken, thus he would have acted, thus he would have suffered, if he had been circumstance das we are now.</Q></P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of thinking of thy neighbours
<PB N="92" REF="028306_0097_0FD8956383CE55B0"/>around thee, and of inquring how they behave, keep Christ in thine eye, and in thy whole conduct follow him. <HI>Follow him</HI> in his steady and conscientious dis∣charge of duty, amidst opposition from evil men, and a corrupted world. Follow him in his patient sub∣mission to his Father's will, and the calmness of his spirit under all trials. Follow him in his acts of dis∣interested benevolence, in his compassion to the un∣happy, in readiness to oblige, to assist, and to releave. Immitate the mildness and gentleness of his manners. Imitate the affabiiity and condescension which appear∣ed in his behaviour. Imitate the uncorrupted sim∣plicity and purity which distinguished his whole life.</P>
<P>These are much worthier and nobler objects of your attention, than any of those tristing varieties which you can explore and discover in the characters of those among whom you live. By lifting your view to so high a standard, you will be preserved from de∣scending to those futile and corrupting employments of thought, which occupy the idle, the vain, and the malignant. It is incredible, how much time and at∣tention are thrown away by men, in examining the affairs of others, and discussing their conduct. Were their time and attention thrown away only, the evil would in some degree, be less. But they are worse than thrown away; they are not merely fruitless, but productive of much mischief. Such a habit of thought is connected with a thousand vices. It is the con∣stant source of rash and severe censure. It arises from envy and jealousy. It foments ill nature and pride. It propagates misunderstanding and discord. All those evils would be prevented, if the reproof which our Lord administers in the text came oftener home, with proper authority, to the reflection of men: <HI>What is that to thee?</HI> Each of us have more material and im∣portant business of our own to fulfil. Our task is as∣signed;
<PB N="93" REF="028306_0098_0FD89564FB7B37F8"/>our part allotted. Did we suitably examine how that part was performed, we should be less dis∣posed to busy ourselves about the concerns of others. We would discover many a disorder to be corrected at home; many a weed to be pulled out from our own grounds; much remaining to be done, in order to render ourselves useful in this world, and fit for a world to come.—Wherefore, instead of being critics on others, let us employ our criticism on ourselves. Leaving others to be judged by Him who searcheth the heart, let us implore his assistance for enabling us to act well our own part, and to follow Christ.</P>

<P>THESE words of our Lord were occasioned by a circumstance in his behaviour which appeared mysterious to his disciples. When about to celebrate his last passover, he meant to give them an instruc∣tive lesson of condescension and humility. The mode which he chose for delivering this instruction, was the emblematical action of washing their feet. When Simon Peter saw his Master addressing himself to the
<PB N="94" REF="028306_0099_0FD895C205FA5988"/>performance of so menial an office, he exclaims with the greatest surprise, <HI>Lord dost thou wash my feet?</HI> Our Lord replies, in the words of the text, <HI>What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</HI> <Q>My behaviour in this instance, may seem unac∣countable to you at present, but you shall after∣wards receive a satisfactory explication of the in∣tent of that symbol which I now employ.</Q></P>

<PB N="95" REF="028306_0100_0FD87F86D21F8E90"/>mixture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and darkness presents it∣self to us, when we attempt to trace the affairs of the world up to any wise and righteous administration. We see justice and order begun; but on many occa∣sions they seem to be deserted. The ray of light which we had traced for a while, suddenly forsakes us; and, where we had looked for the continuance of order, we meet with confusion and disappointment. —For instance; when we examine the constitution of the human mind, we discern evident marks of its being framed with a view to favour and reward virtue. Conscience is endowed with signal authority to check vice. It brings home uneasiness and remorse to the bad; and it sooths and supports the righteous with self approbation and peace. The ordinary course of human things is made to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncide in some degree with this constitution of our nature. The worthy and the good are in general, honoured and esteemed. <HI>He that walketh uprightly,</HI> is, for the most part, found to <HI>walk surely.</HI> The chief misfortunes that befal us in life can be traced to some vices or follies which we have committed; and it almost never happens but the <HI>sinners own wickedness is made,</HI> sooner or later, <HI>to reprove him, and his backslidings to correct him.</HI></P>
<P>All this carries the impress of a just Providence, of a wise and bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olent administration of the universe, We cannot avoid perceiving that the Almighty hath <HI>set his throne for judgment.</HI> At the same time, when we pursue our enquiries, the Almighty appears to <HI>hold back the face of his throne, and to spread his cloud upon it.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job. xxvi. 9.</NOTE> For in looking abroad into the world how many scenes do we behold, which are far from correspond∣ing with any ideas we could form of the government of Heaven? Many nations of the earth we see lying in
<PB N="96" REF="028306_0101_0FD87F887786C860"/>a state of barbarity and misery; sunk in such gross ig∣norance as degrades them below the rank of rational beings; or abandoned to be the prey of cruel oppres∣sion and tyranny. When we look to the state of in∣dividuals around us, we hear the lamentations of the unhappy on every hand. We meet with weeping pa∣rents and mourning friends. We behold the young cut off in the flower of their days, and the aged left desolate in the midst of sorrows. The useful and virtuous are swept away, and the worthless left to flourish. The lives of the best men are often fil∣led with discouragements and disappointed hopes. Merit languishes in neglected solitude; and vanity and presumption gain the admiration of the world. From the scourge of calumny, and from the hand of violence the injured look up to God as the Avenger of their cause; but often they look up in vain. He is <HI>a God that hideth himself.</HI> He dwelleth, as to them, in the secret place of darkness; or if he dwelleth in light, it is in <HI>light to which no man can approach.</HI> Re∣signation may seal up their lips; but in silence they drop the tear, and mourn while they adore.</P>
<P>Such, it must not be dissembled, are the difficulties which encounter us when we attempt to trace the present ways of God. At the same time, upon re∣flection, we may be satisfied that causes can be assign∣ed for things appearing in this unfavourable light; and that there is no reason to be surprised at the divine conduct being mysterious at present.</P>
<P>The monarchy of the universe is a great and compli∣cated system. It comprehends numberless generations of men, who are brought forth to act their parts for purposes unknown to us. It includes two worlds at once; the world that now is, and which is only a small portion of existence; and a world that is to come, which endures for eternity. To us, no more
<PB N="97" REF="028306_0102_0FD87F8A8C7A61B8"/>than the beginnings of things are visible. We see only some broken parts of a great whole. We trace but a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inks of that chain of being, which, by secret connections, binds together the present and the future. Such knowledge is afforded us as is sufficient for supplying the exigencies and wants of our pres∣ent state; but it does no more. Peeping abroad from a dark corner of the universe, we attempt in vain to explore the counsels that govern the world. It is an attempt to sound an unsathomable deep with a scan∣ty line; and with a feeble wing to ascend above the stars. In any complicated wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even of human art, it is found necessary to be acquainted with the design of the whole, in order to judge of the fitness of its parts. In a scheme so complex as the administration of the world, where all the parts refer to one anoth∣er, and where what is seen is often subordinate to what is in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isible, how is it possible but our judgments must be often erroneous, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mplain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ill-foun∣ded? If a peasant or a cottager be incapable of judging of the government of a mighty empire, is it sur∣prising that we should be at a loss concerning the con∣duct of the Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds his creatures? <HI>What I do thou knowest not now.</HI></P>
<P>But, on this argument still more can be said for our satisfaction. We are to observe, that complete information respecting the ways of God, not only was not to be expected here but, moreover, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it would have been hurtful, if granted to us in our pres∣ent state. It would have proved inconsistent with that state; with the actions which we have to perform in it, and the duties we have to fulfil. It would indeed have overthrown the whole design of our being pla∣ced in this world. We are placed here under the trial of our virtue. Ignorance of the ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts that are ordained to besal us, ignorance of the plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the
<PB N="98" REF="028306_0103_0FD87F8C11C2B120"/>decrees of heaven, enter necessarily into a state of tri∣al. In order to exercise both our intellectual and moral powers, and to carry them forward to im∣provement, we must be left to find our way in the midst of difficulties and doubts, of hardships, and sufferings. We must be taught to act our part with constancy, though the reward of our constancy, be dist∣ant. We must learn to bear with patience whate∣ver our Creator judges proper to lay upon us, though we see not the reason of the hardships he inflicts. If we were let into the secret of the whole plan of Prov∣idence; if the justice of Heaven were, in every step of its procedure, made manifest to our view, man would no longer be the creature he now is, nor would his present state answer any purpose of discipline or trial.</P>
<P>Mystery and darkness, therefore, must of necessity now take place in the course of things. Our present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate can be no other than a state of twilight or dawn, where dubious forms shall often present themselves to us, and where we shall find ourselves in a middle condition between complete light and total darkness. Had we enjoyed no evidence of a just Judge ruling the earth, and of his providence, interposing in our affairs, virtue would have been altogether de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of its encouragement and support. Had the evidence, on the other hand, been so strong as to place the Almighty constantly before our eyes, the intention of our pre∣sent existence would have been defeated, and no trial of virtue have remained. Instead therefore, of com∣plaining of the obscurity which at present covers the conduct of Providence, we see that, on the whole, we have reason to submit and adore.</P>
<P N="2">II. The text suggests that, though what God is doing, or what he intends to do, we <HI>know not now,</HI> yet there is ground to believe, that at some future pe∣riod
<PB N="99" REF="028306_0104_0FD87F8D854837F8"/>we shall receive information. <HI>What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt now hereafter.</HI> The question here arises, what that <HI>hereafter</HI> is to which were are to look for the solution of our present doubts?</P>
<P>In the first place <HI>hereafter</HI> may, on some occasions, refer to the subsequent course of events in this world. It often happens that the consequences of things throw light on the designs of God. The history of Providence, in proportion as it advances, disembroils itself. Though our present condition forbids exten∣sive and complete information, yet as much is some∣times allowed to appear as gives us favourable open∣ings into the righteous and benevolent counsels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heaven.—Thus, in the public affairs of the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has been frequently seen, that from the most unpro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ising causes important and beneficient effects have in the sequel, arisen. In our own country, at o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> period, the violent passions of a prince gave beginning to the Reformation. At another period, arbitrary at∣tempts against religion and liberty occasioned that happy Revolution which has formed the aera of nati∣onal prosperity. In m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y instances, <HI>the wrath of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> has been made to <HI>praise God.</HI> Those wars and com∣motions that shake the moral world have answered si∣milar purposes with tempest in the natural world, of purging the air from noxious vapours, and restoring it to a temperature more found and wholesome. From the midst of confusion order has been made to spring, and from temporary mischiefs, lasting advan∣tages to arise.—In all cases of this nature, with which sacred and civil history abounds, secret designs of hea∣ven were going on, which were unfolded in the end. The wheel was always in motion. The hand of the clock was advancing with unperceived progress, till the moment came of its striking the appointed hour.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="028306_0105_0FD87F8F052AC4E8"/>
In like manner, with respect to individuals, there is often a <HI>hereafter</HI> in the course of their lives, which discloses and justifies the ways of God. Not to mention the good effects which misfortunes are found to produce on the minds of men, by checking their vices, and correcting their errors, innumerable ex∣emplifications can be given, of misfortunes paving their way to future advancement in the world. We are always querulous and impatient when designs suc∣ceed not according to our wish, Ignorant of what futurity is to bring forward, occupied with nothing but the present, we exclaim, Where is God? Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the sceptre of righteousness? <HI>Hath he forgotten to be gracious?</HI> or doth he indeed see, and is there know∣ledge in the Most High?—<HI>God seeth not as man seeth:</HI> He looketh not merely to what you suffer, but to what the effect of these sufferings is to be. Consider only in how different a light the Patriarch Joseph would view the events of his life after he had seen in what they had terminated, from the light in which he saw them, when led away by Ishmaelites as a slave, or when thrown by Potiphar into the Egyptian prison. We murmur against Providence, just as the impetuous youth frets against his instructors and tutors, who are keeping him under a strict, and as he thinks a needless, discipline. He knows not tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by their instruction and discipline, they are laying the foun∣dation of his future fortunes; of the wealth which he is to acquire, and of the advancement to which he is to rise in the world. What may justly be said to him by his tutors and instructors, is equally applicable to us all under our present state of education; <HI>What! do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</HI> —Regarding, then, the unknown issue of all world∣ly events in this life, let us never despair; let us ne∣ver think dishonourable of the government of God;
<PB N="101" REF="028306_0106_0FD87F9085826680"/>but have patience till his providence accomplish its designs in its own way, and at its own time. <HI>Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the second place, the expression of <HI>hereafter</HI> in the text must be understood to refer, in its full extent, not to future events in this life, but to a subsequent state of being. For this life is no more than the begin∣ning of the mighty and extensive plans of Providence. The seeds are only now sown, of what is to ripen and come forth, at the harvest of the world; when the revolution of the great moral year shall be finished, and the government of God shall obtain its full com∣pletion. It is the chief scope of religion to direct our view to this period; and it hath often taught us that the knowledge of the ways of God, then enjoyed by the blessed, shall constitute a chief article of their fe∣licity. <HI>Now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face. Now we know in part; but then we shall know even as we are known. When that which is per∣fect is come, then that which is in part shall be done a∣way. In God's light we shall see light</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 10 12. Psalm xxxvi. 9.</NOTE>. The reasons that required obscurity to remain for a while on the ways of God no longer subsist. The education of good men is completed; and the intention of those steps of education, which once they could not com∣prehend, now becomes apparent—Why this man was prematurely carried away from the world in the be∣ginning of a promising course; why that deserving family were left overwhelmed with grief and despair, by the loss of one who was their sole benefactor and support; why friendships cemented by tender ties were suddenly torn asunder by death: These are in∣quiries to which we can now make no reply; and
<PB N="102" REF="028306_0107_0FD87F920526E0D0"/>which throw a dark gloom over the conduct of the Almighty. But the spirits of the just above, who are admitted to a larger view of the ways of God, see the reasons of such counsels. They see that one man was seasonably taken away from dangers and evils to come, which, unknown to him, were ho∣vering over his head. They see that Providence was in secret preparing unexpected blessings for the family who appeared to be left disconsolate and hopeless. They see that it was time for friendships to be dissol∣ved, when their longer continuance would to some of the parties have proved a snare. Where we behold nothing but the rod of power stretched forth, they discern an interposition of the hand of mercy.</P>
<P>Let us wait till this promised <HI>hereafter</HI> arrive, and we shall in like manner be satisfied concerning the events that now disturb and perplex us. We shall then know why so much darkness and misery have been so long permitted to remain on the earth, and so much oppression and tyranny to prevail among the nations. We shall see rising, as from the ashes of the old world, a new and beautiful structure; <HI>new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.</HI> As wide as is the difference between the appearance of the world, when it lay in its primitive chaos, <HI>with∣out form and void,</HI> and the appearance which it has now assumed, when resplendent with the light of the sun, and decked with the beauties of nature; such is the difference between the divine plans in their begin∣nings, and in their full completion. At the conclu∣sion, and not till then, the glory of the Lord shall-become manifest to all; and as it is described in the book of the Revelation, a voice shall be heard <HI>from every creature which is in heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, saying. Blessing and honour, and power and glory, be to him that sitteth on the throne. Great and
<PB N="103" REF="028306_0108_0FD87F93855E2928"/>marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 13. xv. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Application of the doctrines that have been illustra∣ted may be made to two classes of men.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> To sceptics; who, from the present myste∣rious conduct of Providence, hastily draw the conclu∣sion, that no government is exercised over human af∣fairs, but that all things are suffered indiscriminately to come alike to all men.—I have shown that from the inadiquate views which we are at present able to take of the general system, such mysterious appear∣ances of Providence must be expected to take place. Not only so, but I have also shown it to be fit and necessary that this mixture of obscurity should now remain; as a full display of regular justice and order would be inconsistent with the moral improvement of men in this life.—Let me desire the sceptic to look to the state of the natural world. When he thinks of the order and magnificence that prevails in it, he will perhaps, be unwilling to pronounce it the mere proudction of chance. He cannot but recognise the hand of Intelligence, and acknowledge it to have pro∣ceeded from a designing Cause. I ask him, Whether in the natural world he discerns not as many mysteri∣ous and puzzling appearances as are to be found in the moral world? Are not destructive storms, burn∣ing mountains, uninhabitable deserts, as difficult to be reconciled to his pre-conceived ideas of supreme wisdom and goodness in the Creator, as the sufferings and afflictions which in the course of Providence be∣fall the just? The natural and the moral world are, in this respect, counterparts to one another. Both are marked with the same characters, and carry the impress of the same powerful and gracious hand. In
<PB N="104" REF="028306_0109_0FD87F95C5B63FF0"/>both, it is evidently the intention of the first Author not to render every thing level to our capacity; but in the midst of high design and order, to allow certain objects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o appear, which contradict the ideas we had formed, and mock our vain researches. Now, if we are obliged to admit that the order and beauty of the natural world sufficiently prove it to be the work of a wise Creator, notwithstanding the seem∣ing deformities which it exhibits; are we not led by the same train of reasoning, to conclude that the moral world is under the direction of a wise Govern∣or, though much of what he now does we cannot satisfactorily explain?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The doctrine of the text is to be applied not only for silencing sceptics but for comforting the pious. Never let them be dejected by the darkness which now covers the ways of the Almighty. If he withdraws himself from their view, it is not because he neglects them; but because they are incapable of comprehending his designs; because it were not for their good that all his designs were revealed to them. —Instead of perplexing themselves about what is ob∣scure, let them rest on the clear and authentic discov∣eries that have been given of, the divine goodness. Let them rest on those great and signal facts that prove it; particularly on that illustrious fact, the re∣demption of the world by Jesus Christ, He that <HI>spa∣red not his own Son, but gave him up for us all,</HI> will assuredly not always conceal himself from those who serve him. Though what he does they <HI>know not now,</HI> the time approaches when <HI>they shall know hereafter.</HI> Till that time come, let them believe and trust; let them hope and adore. From this conclusion let them, never depart, that to <HI>fear God and keep his command∣ments</HI> is in every situation the truest wisdom; that, if there be government in the universe at all, the virtu∣ous
<PB N="105" REF="028306_0110_0FD87F975158FAA0"/>and the worthy are loved and protected by Heav∣en; that in <HI>due season they shall reap if they faint not; for the care of them is with the Lord, and their reward with the Most High.</HI></P>

<P>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BONDAGE and subjection are disagreeable sounds to the ear, disagreeable ideas to the mind. The advocates of vice, taking advantage of those na∣tural impressions, have in every age employed them for discrediting religion. They represent it as the bondage and confinenement of the free-bron soul of man; as a state of perpetual constraint, formed by a system of severe rules, which designing men have contrived to impose as fetters on the multitude. On the other hand, they paint a licentious course to them∣selves, and hold it out to the world, as the gay and pleasurable enjoyment of life; whore, having sur∣mounted the prejudices of education, and timor∣ous scruples of conscience, men can think and act at pleasure, and give full scope to every wish of the heart.— But what if those pretended sons of freedom be them∣selves
<PB N="106" REF="028306_0111_0FD87F98C5288E80"/>held in miserable subjection, and their boasts of liberty be no more than the <HI>swelling words of vani∣ty?</HI> The Apostle asserts in the text, that while they <HI>promise liberty</HI> to others, they are <HI>the servants,</HI> or slaves, of <HI>corruption, overcome, and brought into bondage by it.</HI> This assertion of the Apostle I purpose to illustrate. I shall endeavour to make it appear, that no true li∣berty can arise from vice; that bad men undergo the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t servitude; and that no one is free, but he who is virtuous and good.</P>
<P>It is necessary to begin with removing false ideas of liberty, and showing in what it truely consists. We are not to imagine that to be free imports our be∣ing set loose from restraint or rule of every kind. No man, in any condition of life, is at liberty to act always as he pleases, and to gratify every wish he forms. The nature of the human state necersarily imposes on all men various restraints. The laws of society allow no one to indulge himself in pursuits or pleasures that are injurious to his neighbour. Even our own nature limits our pleasures within certain bounds. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l our desires cannot be gratified together. They frequently interfere, and reqiure im who would indulge one favourite passion, to deny himself in an∣other. Distinctions, therefore, must be made, pre∣serences be given, and some general regolation of con∣duct be observed, by every one who consults his own welfare. If there be any regulation which ensures us of safety and happiness, to be disengaged from the observance of that regulation is no article of liberty; at least of such liberty; as a wise man would with to en∣joy. It is in effect to be turned loose to our own ruin. It is such liberty as a blind man enjoys, of wander∣ing at random, and striking into every devious path, without a guide to direct his steps, and save him from destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="028306_0112_0FD87F9A466CCA68"/>
That unbounded licentiousness, therefore, which sinners prefer to every regulation of conduct, is alto∣gether different from true freedom. It is in moral behaviour the same as anarchy is in a state, where law and order are extinct. Anarchy, surely, is no less incompatible with true liberty than absolute despo∣tism; and of the two it is hard to say which is the least eligible, or the most miserable state. Liberty by no means supposes the absence of all government. It only supposes that the government under which we are placed is wise; and that the restraints to which we voluntarily submit ourselves have been contrived for the general interest.</P>
<P>To be free, therefore, imports, in general, our being placed in such circumstances, that within the bounds of justice and good order, we can act accord∣ing to our own deliberate choice, and take such mea∣sures for our conduce as we have reason to believe are conducive to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lfare; without being obstructed either by external force, or by violent internal im∣pulse. This is that happy and dignified state which every wise man earnestly wishes to enjoy. The advantages which result from it are chiefly these three; freedom of choice; independence of mind boldness and security. In opposition to these distinguishing characters of liberty, I now proceed to show that, in the first place, vice deprives bad men of free choice in their actions; that, in the second place, it brings them under a slavish dependence on external circumstances; and that, in the third place, it reduces them to that abject, cowardly, and disqui∣eted state which is essentially characteristic of bon∣dage.</P>
<P N="1">I. Vice is inconsistent with liberty, as it deprives sinners of the power of free choice, by bringing them under the dominion of passions and habits. Religion
<PB N="108" REF="028306_0113_0FD87F9BE2F7CC28"/>and virtue address themselves to reason. They call us to look round on every sule; to think well of the consequences of our actions; and, before we take any step of importance, to compare the good with the evil that may ensue from it. He therefore who follows their dectates, acts the part of a man who freely consults, and chuses, for his own interest. But vice can make no pretensions of this kind. It awaits no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the test of deliberate comparison and choice; but overpowers us at once by some striking impression of present advantage or enjoyment. It hurries us with the violence of passion; captivates us by the allure∣ments of pleasure; or dazzels us by the glare of riches. The sinner yields to the impulse, merely because he cannot resist it. Reason remonstrates; conscience endeavours to check him; but all in vain. Having once allowed some strong passion to gain the ascendant, he has thrown himself into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>dle of a torrent, against which he may sometimes faintly struggle, but the impetuosity of the stream bears him along. In this situation he is so far from being free, that he is not master of himself. He does not go, but is driven; tossed, agitated, and impelled; passive, like a ship to the violence of the waves.</P>
<P>After passion has for a while exercised its tyranni∣cal sway, its vehemence may by degrees subside. But when by long indulgence, it has established habits of gratification, the sinner's bondage becomes then more confirmed, and more miserable. For during the heat of pursuit he is little capable of reflection. But when his ardour is abated, and nevertheless, a vitious habit rooted, he has full leisure to perceive the heavy yoke he has brought upon himself. How many slaves do we see in the world to intemperance, and all kinds of criminal pleasure, merely though the influence of customs which they had allowed to become so inveter∣ate
<PB N="109" REF="028306_0114_0FD87F9E246A28A8"/>that it was not in their power to alter them? Are they not often reduced to a condition so wretched, that when their licentious pleasures have become utterly insipid, they are still forced to continue them, solely because they cannot refrain: not because the indulg∣ence gives them pleasure, but because abstinence would give them pain; and this too, even when they are obliged at last to condemn their habits of life, as injuring their fortune, impairing their constitution, or disgracing their character? Vice is not of such a nature that we can say to it, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come and no further.</HI> Having once entered into its territories, it is not in our power to make a retreat when we please. <HI>He that committeth sin is the servant of sin.</HI> No man who has once yielded up the governmen of his mind, and given loose rein to his desires and passions can tell how far these may carry him. He may be brought into such a desperate state, that nothing shall remain for him but to look back with regret upon the forsaken path of innocence and liberty; and, severely conscious of the thraldom he suffers, to groan under fetters which he despairs of throwing off. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good who are accustomed to do evil.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xiii. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>Vice confirms its dominion, and extends it still farther over the soul, by compelling the sinner to sup∣port one crime by means of another. Not only is he enslaved to those vices which take their rise from his one inclination, but they render others necessary, to which, against his inclination, he must submit; and thereby strengthen the commanding power of ini∣quity within him. The immoderate love of pleasure for instance, leads him into expense beyond his for∣tune. In order to support that expense, he is oblig∣ed
<PB N="110" REF="028306_0115_0FD8802209167A20"/>to have recourse to low and dishonourable methods of gain, which originally he despised. To cover these, he is forced upon arts of dissimulation and fraud. One instance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obliges him to support it by another; till, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there arises a character of complicated vice; of luxury shooting forth into base∣ness, dishonesty, injustice, and perhaps cruelty. It is thus that one favourite passion brings in a tribe of auxiliaries to complete the dominion of sin. Among all our corrupt passions there is a strong and intimate connection. When any one of them is adopted into our family, it never quits us until it has fathered upon us all its kindred.—By such means as these, by the violence of passions, by the power of habits, and by the connection of one vice with another, sin estab∣lishes that servitude over the will, which deprives bad men of all power of free choice in their actions.</P>
<P N="2">II. The slavery produced by vice appears in the dependence under which it brings the sinner, to cir∣cumstances of external fortune. One of the favour∣ite characters of liberty, is the independence it be∣stows. He who is truly a freeman is above all servile compliances, and abject subjection. He is able to rest upon himself; and while he regards his superiors with proper deference, neither debases himself by cringing to them, nor is tempted to purchase their fa∣vour by dishonourable means. But the sinner has forfeited every privilege of this nature. His passi∣ons and habits render him an absolute dependant on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickel humours of men. For it is by these he subsists, and among these his happiness is sought; according as his passions deter∣mine him to pursue pleasures, riches, or preferments. Having no fund within himself whence to draw en∣joyment, his only resource is in things without. His
<PB N="111" REF="028306_0116_0FD88023545CB138"/>hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He par∣takes in all its vicissitudes; and is moved and shaken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the strict∣est sense a slave to the world.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. <HI>The up∣right man is satisfied from himself.</HI> He despises not the advantages of fortune; but he centers not his hap∣piness in them. With a moderate share of them he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. Hap∣py in his own integrity, conscious of the esteem of good men, reposing firm trust in the providence, and the promises of God, he is exempted from servile de∣pendence on other things. He can wrap him∣self up in a good conscience, and look forward, with∣out terror, to the change of the world. Let all things shift around him as they please, he believes that, by the divine ordination, they shall be made <HI>to work to∣gether</HI> in the issue <HI>for his good:</HI> And therefore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be easy in every state. One who pos∣sesses within himself such an establishment of mind, is truly free—But shall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no property assured; whose very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and the sport of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever so splendid, whom his impe∣rious passions detain at their call, whom they send forth at their pleasure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the casual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of the world? Is he free, who must flatter and lie to compass his ends; who must bear with this man's caprice, and that man's scorn; must profess friend∣ship where he hates, and respect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours,
<PB N="112" REF="028306_0117_0FD88024B5CAA528"/>nor to speak his own sentiments; who dares not be honest, lest he should be poor?—Believe it, no chains bind so hard, no setters are so heavy, as those which fasten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more contemptible than that under which the voluptuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man lies to the means of pleasure, gain, or power. Yet this is the boasred liberty, which vice promises, as the recompense of setting us free from the salutary restraints of virtue.</P>
<P N="3">III. Another character of the slavery of vice, is that mean, cowardly, disquieted state, to which it reduces the sinner. Boldness and magnanimity have ever been accounted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> native effects of liberty. He who enjoys it, having nothing to apprehend from op∣pressive power, performs the offices, and enjoys the comforts of life, with a manly and undisturbed mind. Hence his behaviour is dignified, and his sentiments are honourable; while he who is accustomed to bend under servile subjection, has always been found mean-spirited, timorous, and base.—Compare, in these respects, the virtuous and the vicious man, and you will easily see to which of them the characteristics of freedom most justly belong. The man of virtue, relying on a good conscience and the protection of Heaven, acts with firmness and comage; and in the discharge of his duty, fears not the face of man. The man of vice, conscious of his low and corrupt aims, shrinks before the steadfast and piercing eye of integri∣ty; is ever looking around him with anxious and fearful circumspection, and thinking of subterfuges, by which he may escape from danger. The one is <HI>bold as a lion;</HI> the other <HI>sticth when no man pursueth.</HI> To the one, nothing appears contemptible, by which he can procure any present advantage. The other looks with disdain on what ever would degrade his
<PB N="113" REF="028306_0118_0FD880264DDD02E0"/>character. "I will not," says he, <Q>so demean my∣self, as to catch the favour of the greatest man, by this or that low art. It shall not be said or thought of me, that I did what was base in order to make my fortune. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers stoop so low, who cannot be without the savours of the world. But I can want them, and therefore at such a price I will not pur∣chase them.</Q> This is the voice of true liberty; and speaks that greatness of mind which it is form∣ed to inspire.</P>
<P>Corresponding to that abject disposition which characterises a bad man, are the fears that haunt him. The terrors of a slave dwell on his mind, and often appear in his behaviour. For guilt is never free from susp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cion and alarm. The sinner is afraid, some∣times, of the partners of his crimes, lest they betray him; sometimes, of those who have suffered by his crimes, lest they revenge themselves; frequently, of the world around him, lest it detect him; and what is worst of all, he is reduced to be afraid of himself. There is a witness within him that testifies against his misdeeds; and threate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him in secret, when other alarms leave him. Conscience holds up to his view the image of his past crimes, with this inscrip∣tion engraved upon it, <HI>"God will bring every work into judgment."</HI> How opposite is such a state as this, to the peaceful security arising from the liberty enjoy∣ed by the virtuons?—Were there nothing more in the circumstances of sinners to affix upon them the marks of servitude, this alone would be sufficient, that, as the scripture expresses it, <HI>through fear of death they are all their lifetime subject to bondage.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 15.</NOTE> Death sets all other captives free. The slave who digs in the mine, or labours at the oar, can rejoice in the
<PB N="114" REF="028306_0119_0FD88027E50C3CD8"/>prospect of laying down his burden together with his life; and tastes the hope of being at last on equal terms with his cruel oppressor. But to the slave of guilt there arises no hope from death. On the con∣trary he is obliged to look forward with constant ter∣ror to this most certain of all events, as the conclu∣sion of all his hopes and the commencement of his greatest miseries.</P>
<P>I have thus set before you such clear and unequivo∣cal marks of the servitude undergone by sinners, as fully verify the assertion in the text, that a state of vice and corruption is a state of bondage. In order to perceive how severe a bondage it is, let us attend to some peculiar circumstances of aggravation which belong to it.</P>
<P>First, It is a bondage to which the mind itself, the native feat of liberty, is subjected. In other cases, a brave man can comfort himself with reflecting that let tyrants do their worst, let prisons or fetters be his lot, his mind remains unconquered and free. Of this liberty they cannot rob him; here he moves in a higher sphere, above the reach of oppression or con∣finement. But what avails the show of external lib∣berty, to one who has lost the government of him∣self? As our Saviour reasons, in another case, <HI>If the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?</HI> So we may reason here, if that part of thy nature, thy mind, thy will, by which only thou canst enjoy and relish liberty, be itself in bondage to evil passions and habits, how miserable must be that bondage?</P>
<P>Next. It is aggravated by this consideration, that it is a bondage which we have brought upon our∣selves. To have been forced into slavery, is mis∣fortune and misery. But to have renounced our lib∣erty and chosen to be slaves, is the greatest reproach
<PB N="115" REF="028306_0120_0FD880294C0E4208"/>added to the greatest misery. Moments there fre∣quently must be, when a sinner is sensible of the de∣gradation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his state; when he feels with pain the slavish dependence under which he is brought to for∣tune and the world, to violent passions and settled ha∣bits, and to fears and apprehensions arising from con∣scious guilt. In such moments, how cruel is the reflection, that of all this disgrace and misery he has been the author to himself; that by voluntary com∣pliance, he has given to his passions that haughty as∣cendant which they now exercise over him; has forged the chains with which he is bound; and sold himself to do iniquity!</P>
<P>Lastly, The servitude of vice is accompanied with this farther aggravation, that it is subjection to our own servants. Those desires and passions, which the sinner has raised to lawless rule, were given us as instruments of self-preservation; but were plainly designed to be under the direction of a higher power. Of themselves, they are head-strong and blind; they bear all the marks of intended subordination; and conscience is invested with every ensign of authority and supremacy. But sin inverts the whole frame of human nature. It compels reason to bow down before those passions which it was formed to command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and leads it, as is were in triumph, to grace the shameful conquest of its ministers and servants. It has been always observed that none are so insolent in power, as they who have usurped an authority to which they had no right; and so it is found to hold in this in∣stance. The desires and passions of a vicious man, having once obtained an unlimited sway, trample him under their feet. They make him feel that he is sub∣ject to divers, and contradictory as well as imperi∣ous masters, who often pull him different ways. His soul is rendered the receptacle of many repugnant
<PB N="116" REF="028306_0121_0FD8802AAD999580"/>and jarring dispositions; and resembles some barbar∣ous country, cantoned out into different principalities, who are continually waging war on one another.— Such is the state into which sinners have brought them∣selves, in order to be free from the supposed confine∣ment of virtue. Where they had promised them∣selves nothing but ease and pleasure, they are made to experience restraints more severe, and mortificati∣ons more painful, than any which they would have undergone under the discipline of religion.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be contended by some, that al∣though the representation which has now been given of the slavery of sin holds true in certain instances, yet that is applicable only to those who come under the discription of atrocious sinners. They imagine that a certain moderate course may be held in vice, by means of which, men, without throwing alto∣gether aside the restraints of reason, may enjoy an easy and pleasurable life.—By reasoning thus, my friends, you flatter and deceive yourselves to your own destruction. Be assured, that by every vitious indulgence, you are making an approach to a state of complete slavery; you are forfeiting a certain share of your liberty; how soon the whole of it may be forfeited, you are not aware. It is true that all which has now been said of the servitude of sin, ap∣plies only to a character corrupted in the extreme. But, remember that to this extreme no man ever arrives at once. He passes through many of those intermediate stages, in one of which you are now perhaps found. Vice always creeps by degrees; and insensibly twines around us those concealed fet∣ters by which we are at last completely bound.—As you value therefore your liberty and your happiness, avoid every approach to evil. Consider all vicious pleasures as enchanted ground, by entering on which,
<PB N="117" REF="028306_0122_0FD87F7ED1666C08"/>you will be farther and farther ensnared within the magic circle, till at length you are precluded from all retreat. The most pure and virtuous man is al∣ways the freest. The religion of Christ is justly entitled the <HI>perfect law of liberty.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 25.</NOTE> It is only when the <HI>Son makes us free, that we are free indeed:</HI> and it was with reason the Psalmist said, <HI>I will walk at lib∣erty, for I seek thy precepts.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxlx. 47.</NOTE></P>

All external services, which have not this tendency, are entirely insignificant. They degenerate into mere superstition, equally un-acceptable to God, and unprofitable to man. Hence they are so often treated in scripture with high con∣tempt, when substituted in the room of the impor∣tant duties of a virtuous life.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="028306_0123_0FD8802C2BE4E488"/>
Notwithstanding this, it is certain that external services have their own place, and a considerable one too, in the system of religion. What their proper place is no one can be at a loss to discern, who will only make a just distinction between the means, and the end, in religion. It is evident there is danger of mens erring here, either on one side or other; and it is certain that they have erred on both. After it was observed, that mankind were prone to lay too much weight on the external parts of religion, it began to be thought, that no weight was to be allowed to them at all. The time was, when all religion cen∣tered in attending the duties of the church, and pay∣ing veneration to whatever was accounted sacred. This alone sanctified the character, and compensated every blemish in moral conduct. From this extreme, the spirit of the age seems to be running fast into the opposire extreme, of holding every thing light that belongs to public worship. But if superstition be an evil, and a great one it undoubtedly is, irreligi∣on is not a smaller evil. And though the <HI>form of godli∣ness</HI> may often remain, when <HI>the power</HI> of it is want∣ing; yet the <HI>power</HI> cannot well subsist where the <HI>form</HI> is altogether gone.—The holy Psalmist, whose words are now before us, discovers much better principles. Expressing always the highest regard for the laws of God, and the precepts of virtue, he breathes, at the same time, a spirit of pure devotion. Though load∣ed with the cares of royalty, and encircled with the splendour of a court, he thought it well became him to show respect to the great Lord of nature; and on many occasions expresses, as he does in the text, his delight in the public service of the temple. <HI>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</HI> In discoursing from which words I purpose to show the importance of
<PB N="119" REF="028306_0124_0FD8802ED58B9060"/>the public worship of God, and the benefits resulting from it. I shall consider it in three lights; as it re∣spects God; as it respects the world; as it respects ourselves.</P>
<P>I. Let us consider it with respect to God. If there exist a Supreme Being, the Creator of the word, no consequence appears more natural and direct than this, that he ought to be worshipped by his creatures, with every outward expression of submission and honour. We need only appeal to every man's heart, whether this be not a princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple which carries along with it its own obligation, that to Him who is the Fountain of our life, and the Father of our mercies; to Him who has raised up that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>autiful structure of the universe in which we dwell, and where we are surrounded with so many blessings and comforts; solemn acknowledg∣ments of gratitude should be made, praises and prayers should be offered, and ali suitable marks of dependence on him be expressed.—This ob∣ligation extends beyond the silent and secret sen∣timents of our hearts. Besides private devoti∣on, it naturally leads to associations for public worship; to open and declared professions of respect for the Deity. Where blessings are received in com∣mon, an obligation lies upon the community, jointly to acknowledge them. Sincere gratitude is always of open and diffusive nature. It loves to pour itself forth; to give free vent to its emotions; and, before the world, to acknowledge and honour a Benefactor.</P>
<P>So consonant is this to the natural sentiments of mankind, that all the nations of the earth have, as with one consent, agreed to institute some forms of worship; to hold meetings, at certain times, in ho∣nour of their deities. Survey the societies of men in their rudest state; explore the African deserts, the wilds of America or the distant islands of the ocean;
<PB N="120" REF="028306_0125_0FD880319BF6DBF8"/>and you will find that over all the earth some religious ceremonies have obtained. You will every where trace, in one form or other, the temple, the priest, and the offering. The prevalence of the most absurd superstitions furnishes this testimony to the truth, that in the hearts of all men the principle is engraved, of worship being due to that invisible Power who rules the world.—Herein consists the great excellency of Christian religion, that it hath instructed us in the simple and spiritual nature of that worship. Disen∣cumbered of idle and unmeaning ceremonies, its ri∣tual is pure, and worthy of a divine Author. Its positive institutions are few in number, most signifi∣cant of spiritual things, and directly conductive to good life and practice. How inexcusable then are we, if, placed in such happy circumstances, the sense of those obligations to the public worship of God shall be obliterated among us, which the light of na∣ture inculcated, in some measure, on the most wild and barbarous nations?</P>
<P>The refinements of false philosophy have indeed suggested this shadow of objection, that God is too great to stand in need of any external service from his creatures: that our expressions of praise and honour are misplaced with respect to him, who is above all honour and all praise; that in his sight the homage we seek to pay must appear contemptible; and is therefore in itself superfluous and trifling.—But But who hath taught those vain reasoners, that all expressions of gratitude and honour towards a su∣perior become unsuitable, merely because that supe∣rior needs not any returns? Where they ever in∣debted to one whose favours they had it not in their power to repay; and, did they, on that account, feel themselves set loose from every obligation to ac∣knowledge, and to praise their benefactor? On the
<PB N="121" REF="028306_0126_0FD88032FB039EC8"/>contrary, the more disinterested his beneficence was, did not gratitude, in any ingenuous mind, burn with the greatest ardour, and prompt them the more eager∣ly to seize every opportunity of publicly testifying the feelings of their hearts?—Almighty God, it is true, is too great to need our service or homage. But he is also too good not to accept it, when it is the native expression of a grateful and generous mind. If pride and self-sufficiency stiffle all senti∣ments of dependence on our Creator; if levity, and attachment to worldly pleasures, render us totally ne∣glectful of expressing our thankfulness to Him for his blessings; do we not hereby discover such a want of proper feeling, such a degree of hardness and cor∣ruption in our affections, as shows us to be immoral and unworthy; and must justly expose us to the high displeasure of heaven? On the contrary, according to every notion which we can form of the Father of the universe, must it not be acceptable to him to behold his creatures properly affected in heart towards their great benefactor; assembling together to express, in acts of worship, that gratitude, love, and reverence which they owe him; and thus nourishing and pro∣moting in one another an affectionate sense of his goodness? Are not such dispositions, and such a be∣haviour as this, intimately connected with all virtue?</P>
<P><HI>O Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God; and we are the flock of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise. The prayer of the upright is his delight. It cometh before him as in∣cense, and the uplifting of their hands as the evening sac∣rifice.</HI>—Having thus shown the reasonableness of public worship with respect to God, let us now.</P>
<P N="2">II. Consider its importance in another view, as it respects the world. When we survey the general
<PB N="122" REF="028306_0127_0FD88034843554E0"/>state of mankind, we find them continually immers∣ed in worldly affairs; busied about providing the ne∣cessaries of life, occupied in the pursuits of their plea∣sures, or eagerly prosecuting the advancement of their interests. In such a situation of things, a small mea∣sure of reflection might convince any one, that with∣out some returns of sacred days, and some solemn calls to public worship, it were impossible to preserve in the world any sense of objects, so foreign to the gen∣eral current of thought as an invisible Governor, and a future state. If it be of importance to the peace and good order of society, that there should prevail among men the belief of One in the heavens, who is the protector of righteousness and the avenger of crimes; if it be of importance that they be taught to look forward to a day of judgment, when they are to be brought to account for their most secret actions and eternally rewarded or punished, according as their conduct has been good or evil; if such principles as these, I say, be of consequence to the public welfare, they certainly enforce the authority of public worship, and prove the necessity of religions instruction.</P>
<P>I speak now particulary with a view to the multi∣tude, the great mass and body of the people. We all know, how seldom from education, or private in∣struction, they have the advantage of deriving senti∣ments of religion or morality. Early obliged to la∣bour for their bread, they would remain all their days in gross ignorance of every moral or sacred principle, were it not for those public assemblies in which they hear of God, and Christ, and judgment, and heaven and hell. Shut up those temples to which they resort with reverence; exclude them fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opportuni∣ties they now possess of receiving religious instruc∣tion, and imbibing religious ideas; and what can you expect them to become? no other than a feroci∣ous
<PB N="123" REF="028306_0128_0FD880367A8D26A8"/>rabble, who set free from checks of conscience, and fears of divine vengeance, would be prone to eve∣ry outrage which they could commit with impunity. It is well known that, in the early ages of the world, sages and legislators who endeavoured to same and associate the barbarous hordes of men, sound it necessary for this purpose, to have recourse to religi∣on. By bringing the rude multitudes to worthip toge∣ther, and at stated times and places, to join in hymns and songs to their deities, they gradually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>trained them from violence, and trained them to subordina∣tion and civilized life.</P>
<P>During the progress of society in after periods, re∣ligious assemblies at church continue, I am persuad∣ed to have a very considerable influence on the civil∣ization and improvement of the people. Even in∣dependent of effect upon their moral pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciples, by leading numbers of them to meet together in an or∣derly way, and in their most decent appearance, they tend to humanize and polish their manners. They strengthen the social connections, and promote friendly intercourse among those who are in the same neighbourhood, and in the same lines of life. It must at the same time, be agreeable to every hu∣mane mind to think, that one day in seven is al∣lotted for rest to the poor from their daily labours, and for such enjoyments of ease and comfort as their station affords. It is the only day which gives them occasion to feel themselves as belonging to the same class of beings with their superiors; when joining with them in the same acts of worship, and recog∣nizing a common Lord. Amidst those distinctions which the difference of ranks necessarily in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oduces into human society, it is surely fit that there be some occasions when man can meet with man as a brother, in order that the pride of the great may be checked;
<PB N="124" REF="028306_0129_0FD8803842B976C8"/>and the low may be taught that, if they discharge prop∣erly their appointed part, they have reason to expect, from the Lord of the universe, the same rewards with the rich and the mighty.</P>
<P>It will, I believe, be generally admitted that forms of public worship, and means of religious instructi∣on, are important, on several accounts, for the body of the people, and belong to the maintenance of pub∣lic safety and order. But many who admit this are apt to think, that to the common people alone they may be left. To persons of liberal education and enlarged minds, what benefit can arise from hear∣ing what the already know; and what, perhaps, is to be inculcated on them by those who are of inferi∣or capacity to themselves?—Admitting this plea of superiority which their vanity forms, and setting aside for the present any personal obligation they are under to worship God, I must ask such persons, how they can expect that religious assemblies will be long respected by the lower ranks of men, if by men of rank and education they are discountenanced and for∣faken? Do not they know, that those lower ranks are ready to copy the manners, and to follow the ex∣ample of their superiors in all things; but assuredly in nothing more, than in what appears to set them free from restraint, and to gratify licentiousness? While they acknowledge the importance, and even the necessity, of public religion to certain classes of men, do they, nevertheless, contribute by their behaviour to defeat the end of public religion, and to annihilate that importance which they ascribe to it?—They are employed in framing laws and statutes for prevent∣ing crimes, and keeping the disorderly multitude with∣in bounds; and at the same time, by personally dis∣countenancing public worship, they are weakening, they are even abolishing, among the multitude, that
<PB N="125" REF="028306_0130_0FD88039CFCC3080"/>moral restraint, which is of more general influence upon manners than all the laws they frame. In vain they complain of the dishonesty of servants of the inso∣lence of mobs, of the attacks of the highwayman. To all these disorders they have themselves been acces∣sory. By their open disregard of sacred institutions, they have disseminated profligacy among the people. They have broken down the floodgates which served to restrain the torrent; they have let it loose to over∣flow the land; and by the growing deluge may them∣selves be swept away.—But I must next argue upon a different ground; and proceed.</P>
<P N="3">III. To set forth the importance of the public worship of God to every individual, in every rank of life. Whatever his station be, he is still a man; and has the duties of a man to perform. Were his attend∣ance on divine worship of no other effect, than to add countenance to a salutary institution, this alone would render it his duty. But moreover, we assert it to be his duty on his own account; if it be the duty of eve∣ry man to use the proper means of preserving and for∣tifying his virtue. All the Christian institutions have a direct tendency to this end. They all serve to give warmth to piety, and to add solemnity to moral vir∣tue. A very high opinon, indeed, that man must have of his own character, who imagines that, a∣midst all the follies and corruptions of the world, he, stands in need of no assistance for enabling him to act his part with propriety and dignity.</P>
<P>The question is not, whether persons of rank and education are to learn any thing that is new to them by frequenting the places of public worship. The great principles of piety and morality are obvious and ea∣sily known; and we shall readily admit, that there are many to whom no new instruction is communi∣cated in the house of God. But, my friends, the
<PB N="126" REF="028306_0131_0FD8803B43BF4E08"/>purpose of your going there is to have known truths recalled to your mind, and their dormant influence awakened; is to have serious meditations suggest∣ed; to have good dispositions raised; to have the heart adjusted to a composed and tranquil frame. Is there any man of reason and reflection, who will not ac∣knowledge such effects, as far as they follow from at∣tendance on religious ordinances, to be of the most beneficial nature? These occasional cessations from the cares and anxieties of life, these interruptions to the bustle and passions of the world, in order to think and hear of eternity, are both a relief and an improve∣ment to the mind. By this retreat from its ordinary circle of thoughts, it is enabled to return, with more clearness and more vigour, to the business of the world, after a serious and proper pause.</P>
<P>But I must ask the persons with whom I now reason, whether there be no other call to come to God's house, than to hear instruction there? Is not the devout adoration of the God of heaven the principal object of our religious assemblies; and is this what any man of reflection, and of sober mind, dare to make light of? In the temple of the Lord, the rich and the poor, the prince and the peasant, appear as suppliants alike for the protection and favour of the Almighty.—Great and flourishing as thou mayest think thyself, know that thou standest as much in need of that protection, as the meanest of the crowd whom thou beholdest worshipping, with lowly reve∣rence, the God of their fathers. The sun of pros∣perity shines at present on thy head, and the favour∣able gale carries thee sof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly along the stream of life. But the Almighty needs only to give the word, and instantly the tempest shall rise; and thy frail bark shall be driven into the ocean, and whelmed in the deep. <HI>In my prosperity I said I shall never be moved.
<PB N="127" REF="028306_0132_0FD8803CD328B578"/>Thou, Lord, didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</HI>— Look up, with dread, to that awful hand of provi∣dence which is stretched over your heads. Remem∣ber the instability of all human things; Remember it, and tremble, ye who despise the devout acknow∣ledgment of Him who disposes of the human fate! <HI>Though ye live many years and rejoice in them all, remem∣ber the days of darkness; for they shall be many.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>But after all that has been urged on this subject, I am sensible it may be objected, that many who make conscience of paying strict regard to the institutions of religion, do not appear to have derived much ben∣efit from them. They are not, it will be said, more improved in moral conduct, and the proper discharge of the several duties of life, than others who have been apparently negligent of the services of the church. On the contrary, a formal regard to these appears to be substituted by many, in the room of the weightier matters of the law.—Though this should be admitted, it goes no farther than to show that human weakness, or corruption, may defeat the purpose of the most promising means of moral im∣provement. That a superstitious attention to exter∣nal worship, has to often usurped the character, and supplanted the place of real virtue, will not be denied. Admonitions against so dangerous an error cannot be given too often. But because the best things have been often misapplied and abused, no argument thence arises for their being undervalued, and thrown aside. So also reason, instruction, and discipline of every kind, have been frequently perverted to bad ends; and yet their intrinsic worth and usefulness re∣main untouched and acknowledged.—Besides this, it cannot be admitted that, because religious institu∣ted
<PB N="128" REF="028306_0133_0FD8803E4DBC20E8"/>produce not all they good the might be wished, and hoped for, they therefore do no good at all. This were a rash and ill-sounded conclusion. If the mor∣als of men are not always amended by them as they ought to have been, there is reason, however to think that they would have been worse without them. Some check is always given by them to open prosligacy. Some assistance is furnished to good dispositions of heart; at least, to decency of manners. Even mo∣mentary impressions of seriousness made on the thoughtless by the solemnities of religion, are not without their fruit. They leave generally some trace behind them; and when the traces are often renewed, they may be hoped, through the divine blessing, to form at last a deep impression on the mind.</P>
<P>At the same time, I do not say that religious in∣stitutions work upon the mind like a charm; and that mere bodily attendance on them will always ensure us of some profitable effect. Let the means that are employed, for the improvement of rational beings, be ever so powerful in themselves, much of their success will always depend on the manner in which they are received and applied. I shall therefore con∣clude my reasonings on this subject, with a few ob∣servations concerning the dispositions requisite on our part, for deriving benefit from the public ordinances of religion.</P>
<P>The ends for which we assemble in the house of God are two; to worship God, and to listen to relig∣ious instructions.</P>
<P>The public worship of God is the chief and most sacred purpose of every religious assembly of Chris∣tians. Let it here be remembered, that it is not the uttering, or the hearing of certain words, that con∣stitutes the worship of the Almighty. It is the heart that praises, or prays. If the heart accompany not
<PB N="129" REF="028306_0134_0FD88040CA746C10"/>the words that are spoken or heard, we <HI>offer the sac∣rifice of fools.</HI> By the inattentive though, and the giddy and wandering eye, we prosane the temple of the Lord, and turn the appearance of devotion into insult and mockery. With regard to religious in∣struction, attention and reverence are unquestionably due. All religious and moral knowledge comes from God. It is a light from heaven, first transmitted to man by the orginal constitution of his nature, and afterwards made to shine with fairer and fuller lustre by the revelation of the gospel in Jesus Christ. Its brightness may sometimes be stronger, and sometimes weaker, according to the mediums by which it is con∣veyed. But still, as far as the instructions delivered from the pulpit are illuminated by the ray from hea∣ven, they are the truths of God, and ought to be re∣ceived as such. Refinements of vain philosophy, or intricate subtilities of theological controversy, are un∣doubtedly not intitled to such regard. But when the great principles of natural or revealed religion are dis∣cussed; when the important doctrines of the gospel concerning the life, and sufferings, and death of our blessed Redeemer are displayed; or useful instructions regarding the regulation of life, and the proper dis∣charge of our several duties, are the subjects brought into view; it is not then the human speaker, but the divine authority that is to be regarded.</P>
<P>In the speaker, many imperfections and infirmi∣ties may be discovered. The discoveries of the gos∣pel are represented in scripture, as a hidden treasure brought to light; but, by the appointment of God, <HI>we have this treasure in earthen vessels.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor iv. 7.</NOTE> It is not the spirit of curiosity that ought to bring us to church. Too often, is to be feared, we assemble there merely as crities on the preacher; crities on his sentiments,
<PB N="130" REF="028306_0135_0FD88042464F18D8"/>his language, and his delivery. But, such are not the dispositions which become us on so serious an occasi∣on. It is with humility, with fairness, and candour, with an intention to improve ourselves in piety and virtue, with a view to make personal application to our own character, that we ought to hear the word of God.—When we enter the sacred temple, let us ever consider ourselves as creatures surrounded with darkness, seeking illumination from heaven; as guil∣ty creatures, imploring forgiveness from our judge; as frail and mortal creatures, preparing for that eter∣nal habitation into which we know not how soon we are to pass.</P>
<P>If, with such sentiments and impressions we join in the worship of God, and the ordinances of religi∣on, we may justly hope that they shall be accompani∣ed to us with the divine blessing. It is the express pre∣cept of God. <HI>not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Gether together the people, men, women, and children, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this law.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxi. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise.

For, <HI>where two or three are gathered together in his name, our Lord hath told us that he is in the midst of them.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>God hath said that he loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxxviii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>The prayer of the upright is his delight.</HI> Both in their temporal and spi∣ritual concerns, they may be most expected to pros∣per, who can say with the Psalmist in the next, <HI>Lord I hav loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON XII. ON THE <HI>FASHION</HI> OF THE <HI>WORLD</HI> PASSING AWAY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 COR. vii. 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—The fashion of this world passeth away.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO <HI>use this world</HI> so as not to <HI>abuse it,</HI> is one of the most important, and at the same time one of the most difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssons which religion teaches. By so many desires and passions we are connected with the objects around us, that our attachment to them is al∣ways in hazard of becoming excessive and sinful. Hence religion is often employed in moderating this attachment, by rectifying our erroneous opinions, and instructing us in the proper value we ought to set on worldly things. Such was particularly the scope of the Apostle in this context. He is putting the Cor∣inthians in mind that their <HI>time is short:</HI> that every thing here is transitory; and therefore, that in all the different occupations of human life, in <HI>weeping</HI> and <HI>re∣joicing,</HI> and <HI>buying</HI> and <HI>possessing,</HI> they were ever to keep in view this consideration, that <HI>the fashion of this world passeth away.</HI> The original expression imports, the figure or form under which the world presents itself to us. The meaning is. All that belongs to this vi∣sible state is continually changing. Nothing in human affairs is fixed or stable. All is in motion and fluctu∣ation;
<PB N="132" REF="028306_0137_0FD89567FA645570"/>altering its appearance every moment, and passing into some new form. Let us meditate for a little on the serious view which is here given us of the world, in order that we may attend to the improve∣ments which it suggests.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The fashion of the world passeth away,</HI> as the opi∣nions, ideas, and the manners of men are always changing. We look in vain for a standard to ascertain and fix any of these; in vain expect that what has been approved and established for a while, is always to endure. Principles which were of high authority among our ancestors are now exploded. Systems of philosophy which were once universally received, and taught and as infallible truths. are now obliterated and forgotten. Modes of living behaving, and employ∣ing time, the pursuits of the busy, and the entertain∣ments of the gay, have been entirely changed. They were the offspring of fashion, the children of a day. When they had run their course, they expired; and were succeeded by other modes of living, and think∣ing, and acting, which the gloss of novelty recom∣mended for a while to the public taste.</P>
<P>When we read an account of the manners and oc∣cupations, of the studies and opinions, even of our own countrymen, in some remote age, we seem to be reading the history of a different world from what we now inhabit. Coming downwards through some generations, a new face of things appears. Men begin to think, and act, in a different train; and what we call refinements gradually opens. Arriving at our own times, we consider ourselves as having widely enlarg∣ed the sphere of knowledge on every side, having form∣ed just ideas on every subject; having attained the proper standard of manners and behaviour; and won∣der at the ignorance, the uncouthness, and rusticity of our forefathers. But, alas! what appears to us so
<PB N="133" REF="028306_0138_0FD89569948E0DF0"/>perfect shall in its turn pass away. The next race, while they shove us off the stage, will introduce their favourite discoveries and innovations; and what we now admire as the height of improvement, may in a few ages hence be considered as altogether rude and imperfect. As one wave effaces the ridge which the former had made on the sand by the sea shore, so eve∣ry succeeding age obliterates the opinions and modes of the age which had gone before it. <HI>The fashion of the world</HI> is ever passing away.</P>
<P>Let us only think of the changes which our own ideas and opinions undergo in the progress of life. One man differs not more from another, than the same man varies from himself in different periods of his age, and in different situations of fortune. In youth, and in opulence, every thing appears smiling and gay. We fly as on the wing of fancy; and fur∣vey beauties wherev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we cast our eye. But let some more years have passed over our heads, or let disappointments in the world have depressed our spir∣its; and what a change takes place? The pleasing illusions that once shone before us; the splended fa∣bries that imagination had reared; the enchanting maze in which we once wandered with delight, all vanish and are forgotten. The world itself remains the same. But its form, its appearance, and aspect, is changed to our view; its <HI>fashion,</HI> as to us hath <HI>passed away.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. While our opinions and ideas are thus chang∣ing within, the condition of all external things is, at the same time, ever changing without us, and a∣round us. Wherever we cast our eyes over the face of nature, or the monuments of art, we discern the marks of alteration and vicissitude. We cannot tra∣vel far upon the earth, without being presented with many a striking memorial of the changes made by
<PB N="134" REF="028306_0139_0FD8956AF9CF7FE0"/>time. What was once a flourishing city, is now a neglected village. Where castles and palaces stood, fallen towers and ruined walls appear. Where the magnificence of the great shone, and the mirth of the gay resounded, there, as the prophet Isaiah descibes, <HI>the owl and the raven now dwell, thorns come up, and the nettle and the bramble grow in the courts.</HI>—When we read the history of nations, what do we read but the history of incessant revolution and change? We be∣hold kingdoms alternately rising and falling; peace and war taking place by turns; princes, heroes, and statesmen, coming forth in succession on the stage, attracting our attention for a little by the splendid figure they make, and then disappearing and forgotten. We see the <HI>fashion of the world</HI> assuming all its differ∣ent forms, and in all of them, <HI>passing away.</HI></P>
<P>But to historical annals there is no occasion for our having recourse. Let any one, who has made some progress in life, recollect only what he has be∣held passing before him, in his own time. We have seen our country rise triumphant among the nations; and we have seen it also humbled in its turn. We have seen in one hemisphere of the globe new domin∣ions acquired, and in another hemisphere, our old dominions lost. At home, we have seen sactions and parties shift through all their different forms; and ad∣ministrations, in succession, rise and fall. What were once the great themes of eager discussion, and political contest, are now forgotten. Fathers recount them to their children as the tales of other times. New actors have come forth on the stage of the world. New objects have attracted the attention, and new intrigues engaged the passions of men. New mem∣bers fill the seats of justice; new ministers the temples of religion; and a new world, in short, in the course of a few years, has gradually and insensibly risen around us.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="028306_0140_0FD8956C9D8B6E48"/>
When from the public scene we turn our eye to our own private connections, the changes which have taken place in the <HI>fashion of the world,</HI> must touch eve∣ry reflecting mind with a more tender sensibility. For where are now, many of the companions of our early years; many of those with whom we first began the race of life; and whose hopes and prospects were once the same with our own? In recollecting our old acquaintance and friends, what devastations have been made by the hand of time? On the ruins of our form∣er connections, new ones have arisen; new relations have been formed; and the circle of those among whom we live is altogether changed from what it once was. Comparing our present situation with our former condition of life; looking back to our father's house, and to the scenes of youth; remembering the friends by whom we were trained, and the family in which we grew up; who, but with inward emoti∣on, recollects those days of former years, and is dis∣posed to drop the silent tear, when he views the <HI>fashi∣on of the world</HI> thus always <HI>passing away!</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Not only our connections with all things a∣round us change, but our own life, through all its stages and conditions, is ever passing away. How just, and how affecting is that image, employed in the sacred writings to describe the state of man, <HI>we spend our years as a tale that is told!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xc. 9.</NOTE> It is not to any thing great or lasting that human life is compared; not to a moment that is built, or to an inscription that is engraved; not even to a book that is written, or to a history that is recorded; but to a <HI>tale,</HI> which is listened to for a little; where the words are fugitive and passing, and where one incident succeeds and hangs on another, till, by insensible transitions, we
<PB N="136" REF="028306_0141_0FD8956E0259D268"/>are brought to the close; <HI>a tale,</HI> which in some pas∣sages may be amusing, in others, tedious; but wheth∣er it amuses or fatigues, is soon told, and soon for∣gotten. Thus, year steals upon us after year, Life is never standing still for a moment; but continually, though insensibly, sliding into a new form. Infancy ris∣es up fast to childhood; childhood to youth; youth pass∣es quickly into manhood; and the grey hair and the sad∣ed look are not long of admonishing us, that old age is at hand. In this course all generations run. The world is made up of unceasing rounds of transitory existence. Some generations are coming foward into being, and others hastening to leave it. The stream which car∣ries us all along it ever flowing with a quick current, though with a still and noiseless course. The dwell∣ing place of man is continually emptying, and by a fresh succession of inhabitants, continually filling anew. <HI>The memory of man passeth away, like the re∣membrance of a guest who hath tarried but one night.</HI></P>
<P>As the life of man, considered in its duration, thus fleets and passes away, so during the time it lasts, its condition is perpetually changing. It affords us noth∣ing on which we can set up our rest; no enjoyment or possession which we can properly call our own. When we have begun to be placed in such circum∣stances as we desired, and wish our lives to proceed in the same agreeable tenor, how often comes some unexpected event across, to disconcert all our schemes of happiness? Our health declines; our friends die; our families are scattered; something or other is not long of occurring, to show us that the wheel must turn round; <HI>the fashion of the world</HI> must <HI>pass away.</HI> Is there any man who dares to look to futurity with an eye of confident hope; and to say, that against a year hence, he can promise being in the same condi∣tion of health of fortune, as he is at present? The
<PB N="137" REF="028306_0142_0FD8956F7A30ED48"/>seeds of change are every where sown in our state; and the very causes that seemed to promise us securi∣ty, are often secretly undermining it. Great fame provokes the attacks of envy and reproach. High health gives occasion to intemperance and disease. The elevation of the mighty never sails to render their condition tottering; and that obscurity which shelters the mean, exposes them, at the same time, to become the prey of oppression. So completely is the <HI>fashion of this world</HI> made by Providence for change, and pre∣pared for <HI>passing away.</HI> In the midst of this instabili∣ty, it were some comfort, did human prosperity decay as slowly as it rises. By slow degrees, and by many interveining steps, it rises. But one day is sufficient to scatter, and bring it to nought. I might add,</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the world itself in which we dwell, the basis of all our present enjoyments, is itself contriv∣ed for change, and designed to pass away. While the generations of men come forth in their turns, like troops of succeeding pilgrims, to act their part on this globe, the globe on which they act is totter∣ing under their feet. It was once overflowed by a de∣luge. It is shaken by earthquakes; it is undermin∣ed by subterraneous fires; it carries many a mark of having suffered violent convulsions, and of tending to dissolution. Revelation informs us, that there is a day approaching, in which <HI>the heavens shall pass a∣way with a great noise: the elements shall melt with fer∣vent heat; and the earth and the works therein shall be burnt up.</HI> When this destined hour arrives, the <HI>fash∣ion of the world</HI> shall have finally <HI>past away.</HI> Immor∣tal spirits shall then look back upon this world, as we do at present on cities and empires, which were once mighty and flourishing, but now are swept from ex∣istence, and their place is no more to be found.</P>
<P>I shall insist no longer on this representation of
<PB N="138" REF="028306_0143_0FD89571B9D6F220"/>things. Enough has been said, to show that the <HI>fash∣ion of the world,</HI> in every sense, <HI>passes</HI> away. Opin∣ions and manners, public affairs and private concerns the life of man, the conditions of fortune, and the earth itself on which we dwell, are all changing around us.—Is every thing, then, with which we are connected, passing and transitory? Is the whole state of man no more than a dream or fleeting vision? Is he brought forth, to be only the child of a day? Are we thrown into a river, where all flows, and noth∣ing stays; where we have no means of resisting the current; nor can reach any firm ground, on which to rest our foot?—No, my brethren; man was not doomed to be so unhappy; nor made by his Creator so much in vain. There are three fixed and perma∣nent objects, to which I must now call your attention, as the great supports of human constancy amidst this fugitive state. Though this world changes and pass∣es away, virtue and goodness never changes; heaven and immortality pass not away.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Virtue and goodness never change. Let opinions and manners, conditions and situations, in public and in private life, alter as they will, virtue is ever the same. It rests on the immovable basis of Eternal Truth. Among all the revolutions of hu∣man things it maintains its ground; ever possessing the veneration and esteem of mankind, and conferring on the heart, which enjoys it, satisfaction and peace. Consult the most remote antiquity. Look to the most savage nations of the earth. How wild, and how fluctuating soever the ideas of men may have been, this opinion you will find to have always prevai∣led, that probity, truth, and beneficence, form the honour and the excellency of man. In this, the phi∣losopher and the savage, the warrior and the hermit, join. At this altar all have worshipped. Their of∣ferings,
<PB N="139" REF="028306_0144_0FD895733AC77C40"/>many have been unseemly. Their notions of virtue may have been rude, and occasionally taint∣ed by ignorance and superstition; but the fundamental ideas of moral worth have ever remained the same.</P>
<P>Here then is one point of stability, affected by no vicissitudes of time and life, on which we may rest. Our fortunes may change, and our friends may die; but virtue may still be our own; and as long as this remains, we are never miserable. <HI>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 5, 6.</NOTE> He who, with the holy man of old, can hold this language, may with undisturbed mind survey time flying away, life decaying, and the whole fashion of the world changing around him. He hath within himself, a source of consolation and hope, independent of all earthly objects. Every terrestrial glory sparkles only for a little, with tran∣sient brightness. But virtue shines with eternal and unalterable splendour. It derives its origin from heaven; and partakes both of the lustre, and the sta∣bility, of celestial objects. <HI>It is the brightness of the everlasting light; the unspotted mirror of God, and the image of his goodness.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, God never changes. Amidst the unceasing vicissitude of earthly things, there re∣mains at the head of the universe an eternal protector of virtue, whose <HI>throne is established for ever.</HI> With him there is <HI>no variableness, neither any shadow of turn∣ing;</HI> no inconstancy of purpose, and no decay of wis∣dom or of power. We know that he loved righte∣ousness from the beginning of days, and that he will continue to love it unalterably to the last. Foreseen by him was every revolution which the course of ages has produced. All the changes which happen in the
<PB N="140" REF="028306_0145_0FD89574BA709A10"/>state of nature, or the life of men, were comprehend∣ed in his decree. How much soever worldly things may change in themselves, they are all united in his plan; they constitute one great system or whole, of which he is the Author; and which, at its final com∣pletion, shall appear to be perfect. His dominion holds together, in a continual chain, the successive variety of human events; gives stability to things that in themselves ars fluctuating; gives constancy even to the <HI>fashion of the world</HI> while it is <HI>passing away.</HI> Wherefore, though all things change on earth, and we ourselves be involved in the general mutability, yet as long as, with trust and hope, we look up to this Supreme Being, we rest on the <HI>rock of ages,</HI> and are safe amidst every change. We possess a fortress to which we can have recourse in all dangers; a refuge under all storms; <HI>a dwelling place in all generations.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> and last place, heaven and immortality pass not away. The fleeting scenes of this life are to be confidered as no more than an introduction to a nobler and more permanent order of things, when man shall have attained the maturity of his being. This is what reason gave some ground to expect; what revelation has fully confirmed; and in confirm∣ing it, has agreed with the sentiments and anticipati∣ons of the good and wise in every age. We are taught to believe that what we now behold, is only the first stage of the life of man. We are arriv∣ed no further than the threshold, we owell as in the outer courts of existence. Here, tents only are pitched; tabernacles erected for the sojourners of a day. But in the region of eternity, all is great, stable, and unchanging. There, the <HI>mansions</HI> of the just are prepared: there, the <HI>city which hath foundations</HI> is built; there is established, the kingdom <HI>which cannot be mo∣ved.</HI> Here, every thing is in stir and fluctuation; because here good men continue not, but pass onward
<PB N="141" REF="028306_0146_0FD8957639D1BA30"/>in the course of being. There, all is serene, steady and orderly; because there remaineth the final <HI>reft of the people of God.</HI> Here, all is corrupted by our folly and guilt; and of course must be transient and vain. But there, purchased by the death, and secured by the resurrection of the Son of God, is an <HI>inheritance in∣corruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI> There reigns the tranquillity which is never troubled. There shines that sun which never sets. There flows that river of pleasures, which is always unruffled and pure. Looking forward to those divine habitations, the changes of the present world disappear to the eye of faith; and a good man becomes ashamed of suf∣fering himself to be dejected by what is so soon to pass away.</P>
<P>Such are the objects you ought to oppose to the transient <HI>sashion of the world;</HI> Virtue, and God, and Heaven. Fixing your regard on these, you will have no reaso to complain of the lot of man, or the world's mutability.—The design of the preceding repre∣sentation which I gave of the world, was not to in∣dulge vain declamation; to raise fruitless melancho∣ly; or to throw an unnecessary cloud over human life. But to show the moderation requisite in our attatch∣ment to the world; and at the same time, to point out the higher objects both of attention and consolati∣on which religion affords.—Passing and changea∣ble as all human things are, among them, however, we must at present act our part; to them we must re∣turn from religious meditation. They are not below the regard of any Christian; for they form the scene which providence has appointed at present for his ac∣tivity, and his duty.

<HEAD>SERMON XIII. ON <HI>TRANQUILLITY</HI> OF <HI>MIND.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM XV. 5.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—He that doth these things shall never be moved.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TRANQUILLITY of mind, or, in the words of the text, a mind <HI>not moved</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disquieted by the accidents of life, is undoubtedly one of the greatest blessings that we can possess on earth. It is here, mentioned as the reward of the man, whose character had been described in this psalm, as leading a virtuous life, and discharging his duty towards God and his neighbour. It is indeed the ultimate aim, to which the wishes of the wise and reflecting have ever been di∣rected,
<PB N="143" REF="028306_0148_0FD895798E808258"/>that with a mind undisturbed by anxieties, cares, and fears, they might pass their days in a pleasing serenity. They justly concluded that, by en∣joying themselves in peace, they would enjoy, to the greatest advantage, all the comforts of life that came within their reach.</P>
<P>This happy tranquillity, the multitude conceive to be most readily attainable by means of wealth, or, at least, of an easy fortune; which they imagine would set them above all the ordinary disturbances of life. That it has some effect for this purpose, cannot be de∣nied. Poverty and straitened circumstances are of∣ten inconsistent with tranquillity. To be destitute of of those conveniencies that suit our rank in the world; to be burdened with anxiety about making provision for every day which passes over our head; instead of bringing comfort to a family who look up to us for aid, to behold ourselves surrounded with their wants and complaints, are circumstances which can not fail to give much uneasiness to every feeling mind. To take measures, therefore, for attaining a competent fortune, by laudable means, is wise and proper. En∣tire n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ligence of our affairs, and indifference about our worldly circumstances, is, for the most part, the consequence of some vice, or some folly.—At the same time, I must observe, that the attainment of opulence is no certain method of attaining tranquilli∣ty. Embarassments and vexations often attend it; and long experience has shown, that tranquillity is far from being always found among the rich. Nay, the higher that men rise in the world, the greater degrees of power and distinction which they acquire, they are often the farther removed from internal peace. The world affords so many instances of miseries abound∣ing in the higher ranks of life, that it were needless to enlarge on a topic so generally known and admit∣ted.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="028306_0149_0FD87F81EB38D990"/>
Assuming it, therefore, for an undoubted truth, that the mere possession of the goods of fortune may be consistent with the want of inward tranquillity, we must look around for other more certain grounds of it. We must inquire whether any line of conduct can be pointed out, which, independent of external situation in the world, shall tend to make us easy in mind; shall either bestow, or aid, that tranquillity which all men desire. The remaining part of this discourse shall be employed in suggesting, with great plainness of speech, such directions as appear to me most material on this important subject.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> direction, which I have to suggest, is, that we imitate the character of the man who is des∣cribed in this psalm as <HI>walking uprightly, working righteousness, and speaking the truth, as he thinketh in his heart;</HI> that we study to preserve a clear conscience, and to lead a virtuous and honourable, at least an in∣offensive and innocent, life. Of such a man only it can be said, that <HI>doing these things be shall never be moved.</HI> So great is the power of conscience over every human being, that the remembrance of crimes never fails to overthrow tranquillity of mind. Be assured, that he who defrauds his neighbour, who has e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ar∣ed the innocent, has violated his trust, or betrayed his friend, shall never enjoy within himself undis∣turbed quiet. His evil deeds will at times recur to his thoughts, like ghosts rising up in black array be∣fore him to haunt his couch. Even the sense a fool∣ish and trifling conduct, of a life past in idleness and dissipation; by which, though a man has not been guilty of great crimes, he has however wasted his substance, mispent his time, and brought upon himself just reproach; even this, I say, is sufficient to or the much uneasiness and disquiet to the heart. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore who wishes to enjoy tranquillity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="145" REF="028306_0150_0FD8957B7A1C09A0"/>above all things, to act an irreproachable part. With comfort he will rest his head on his pillow at night, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e is conscious that throughout the day he has been doing his duty towards God and man; when none of the transactions of that day come back, in painful remembrance, to upbraid him. To this testimony of a good conscience, let him be able,</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place to join humble trust in the favour of God. As, after the best endeavours we can use, no man's behaviour will be entirely faultless, it is essential to peace of mind, that we have some ground for hope in the Divine mercy, that through the merits of Jesus Christ, our defects shall be forgiven, and grace be shewn us by Heaven. This includes all the duties of faith and repentance that are required by the Gospel; the faithful discharge of which duties is absolutely necessary for delivering us from those fears of another world, which, if not allayed, are sufficient to banish all tranquillity from the heart. Our relig∣ious principles must at the same time be sound and pure; and carefully preserved from the taint of super∣stition, whose gloomy horrors, taking possession of weak and ill-informed minds, convert what they mistake for religion, into a source of misery.—More∣over, it is necessary, that we be able to place trust in God, not only as our future Judge, but as the pres∣ent Govenor of human affairs. So uncertain is the continuance of every earthly comfort, that he, who reposes no confidence in the Supreme Disposer of events, must be often disquieted and dejected. He alone possesses firm tranquillity, who, amidst all hu∣man vicissitudes, looks up, with settled trust, to an almighty Ruler, as to one under whose conduct he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. To him alone belongs that happy privilege,
<PB N="146" REF="028306_0151_0FD8957CFB62FCD8"/>described by the Psalmist; <HI>He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed; trusting in the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have pointed out the primary and essential foun∣dations of tranquillity; virtuous conduct, good prin∣ciples, and pious dispositions. At the same time, a man may be both pious and virtuous, and yet, through some defects in the management of his mind and temper, may not possess that happy serenity and self-enjoyment, which ought to be the portion of virtue and piety. Instances of this will occur to every one who is acquainted with the world. We too often behold persons, whose principles, and whose moral conduct, are in the main unexceptionable, leading an uncomfortable life; throught fretfulness of temper, peevishness of manners, or sullenness of disposition. There is, therefore, some discipline to be studied; there are some subsidiary parts of character to be atten∣ded to, in order to give piety and virtue their full ef∣fect for conferring tranquillity. To the consideration of these secondary means I now proceed. Let me then advise you.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, to attend to the culture and im∣provement of your minds. A fund of useful know∣ledge, and a stock of ideas, afford much advantage for the enjoyment of tranquillity. I do not mean, that every man must study to become deeply learned. The situation of many would not allow it. The taste, and the habits of others, prevent it. But what I mean is, that every man who wishes to lead a comfortable life should provide for himself, as much as he can, by means of observation, reading, and reflecting, a large field of useful thoughts. In a mind absolutely vacant, tranquillity is seldom found. The vacancy too often will be filled up by bad desires and passions.
<PB N="147" REF="028306_0152_0FD8957E8374AC90"/>Whereas, the mind of a wise man is a kingdom to itself. In his lonely, or melancholy hours, he finds always resources within himself, to which he can turn for relief. As there are many occasions when exter∣nal objects afford no pleasure, it is only by being able to rest on the entertainments afforded to himself by his mind, that any one can pass his days with self-enjoyment Let me recommend for the same pur∣pose,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that we be always careful to provide proper employment for our time. Regular industry and labour, with intervals of ease, is perhaps the state most conducive of any to tranquillity. If our station give no call to industry, it will be profita∣ble that we study to have some end or object in view, to which our attention shall be directed. Relaxation from intense, of incessant pursuit, is requisite for com∣fort. But if relaxation degenerate into total idleness, it becomes in a high degree adverse to tranquillity. Every man by his nature, is formed, more or less, for action. In a mind that is entirely quiescent, and that has no object to put it into motion, instead of self-enjoyment, there will be constant languor, tedious∣ness, and misery. Life stagnates in such a situation, like a pool of dead waters; and the man becomes a burden to himself. Violent and dangerous pursuits, which distract and embroil those who are engaged in them. I cannot be understood to recommend. Eve∣ry one sees how foreign these are to a state of tran∣quillity. But in the ordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nor of calm and easy l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, I would advise every one to have some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd be∣fore him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some object which shall bring the mind into action, and fill up the vacuities of time. Pro∣vided the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ject be innocent, and of no unsuitable or degrading nature, it may answer this purpose, though it should not be in itself of high importance. It is
<PB N="148" REF="028306_0153_0FD8957FFB8DC5F8"/>better for the mind to have some determinate directi∣on given it, than to be always left floating, as it were, in empty space.—But about whatever objects we are employed, it is still more material to tranquillity that, in the</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> place, we learn to govern our passions. These are the most frequent disturbers of our peace. Ne∣cessary as their impulse is to give activity to the mind, yet if they are not kept in subordination to reason, they speedily throw all things into confusion. Such of them as belong to the malignant and unsocial class, evidently tend to produce vexation and disquiet. A∣gainst suffering these to gain possession of the heart, admonition is scarcely necessary. But I must admon∣ish you, that even those which are accounted of in∣nocent nature, and which therefore may lay hold of virtuous minds, if they obtain the entire mastery, are sufficient to overthrow the tranquillity of life. Let every one, therefore, who values that tranquillity, study to retain moderation and self-command, even in the midst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passions which have a fair and bland appearance. He will find that the gratification of any one of them, compensates not that perpetual sla∣very to which it will reduce him, when it becomes inordinate.</P>
<P>I have farther to admonish you, that this self-com∣mand is particularly necessary in all that relates to habitual temper. Even where strong passions are out of the question, those slighter emotions which ruffle or four the temper, are sufficient, by their frequent re∣currence, to poison all self-enjoyment. He who would possess a tranquil state, must, above all things, culti∣vate calmness and gentleness of disposition. He ought especially to cultivate it in that society, whether do∣mestic or social, with which he has most frequent in∣tercourse. We all know, that there are thousands
<PB N="149" REF="028306_0154_0FD895818AF8FD90"/>who in pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>d in formal companies, appear to be all gentleness and sweetness, but who, at home, and among their nearest relations, give vent, with freedom, to the most harsh and peevish dispositions. Such persons are not likely to enjoy much real com∣fort. For it is in the daily and familiar intercourse of life, that temper chiefly exerts its power, either for promoting or for disturbing, the tranquillity of our days. On occasions when men come closest to∣gether, if, instead of meeting in smooth contact, they rub and grate on one another, the feelings produced on both sides are of the most offensive and displeasing kind. Nothing can be assumed as a more certain ax∣iom, than that he who allows either inordinate passi∣ons, or a cross temper, to govern him, must, though he should possess all that flourishing fortune can be∣stow, be a stranger to tranquillity.</P>
<P>In the <HI>sixth</HI> place, let me advise you never to ex∣pect too much from the world. High hopes, and florid views, are great enemies to tranquillity. When rashly indulged, they are constantly producing disap∣pointments. Their indulgence, in the mean time, occasions discontent with our present f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion; and he who is discontented cannot be happy. One of the first lessons, both of religion and of wisdom is, to mod∣erate our expectations and hopes; and not to set forth on the voyage of life like men who expect to be always carried forward with a favourable gale. Let your views be suited to your rank and station in the world; and never soar fantastically beyond them. Content yourselves with sober pleasures, and form your relish to them. Be thankful when you are free from pain, though you be not in the midst of high enjoyment, Be satisfied if the path you tread be easy and smooth, though it be not strewed with flowers. Human life admits not of continued pleasure; nor is it always
<PB N="150" REF="028306_0155_0FD895830C519C38"/>rendered happy by great exaltation. Remember, that it is a middle region which is the native station of tranquillity. It neither aspires to those heights of the atmosphere where the thunder is formed; nor creeps always on the ground. Affect not, on every occasion, to put yourselves forward. Be content to retire sometimes into the shade; and allow others to take their proper place.—It will be easily seen, that I speak not now to the ambitious and aspiring; but to those who value tranquillity more than splendid appearance in the world.</P>
<P>Such persons I also advise, while they expect not too much from the world, neither, also, to form too high expectations from the characters of those on whose friendship they rest, and with whom it is their lot to be connected, either in social or domestic rela∣tions. If you have looked for perfection any where, you will find yourself disappointed; and the conse∣quence of this disappointment will be, that friend∣ship will cool, and disgust succeed. If you wish to enjoy comfort in any of your connections, take your fellow-creatures as they are, and look for their imper∣fections to appear. You know you have your own; bear with those of others, as you expect that they are to bear with you. As no one is without his failings, few also are void of amiable qualities. Select for your companions, those who have the greatest share of such qualities; and value them accordingly.—In a word make the best of this world as you find it. Reckon both on the state of human life, and on the society of men, as mixed and cheek quered with good and evil. Carrying always in your eye such views of things, you will be best formed to those equal spirits, and that reasonable disposition of mind, which make the basis of tranquillity. I shall only a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as my</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> and last advice on the subject, to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> re∣treat
<PB N="151" REF="028306_0156_0FD8958487520600"/>with the active business of the world, and to cul∣tivate habits of serious thought and recollection. I before advised those who are not particularly engaged in active life, to form to themselves some object of pursuit, in order to furnish proper employment to time and thought. But the great multitude of men are in a different situation. Industry is required of them; business and cares press; and active pursuits occupy their closest attention. He, who, in this situation, pours himself fourth incessantly on the world, cannot escape partaking much of its disturbance and trouble. Amidst bustle, intrigue, and dissension, he must pass many an uneasy hour. Here an enemy encounters him; there, a rival meets him. A suspicious friend alarms him one hour; an ungrateful one provokes him the next. I do not recommend, that for these rea∣sons, he who studies tranquillity should retire from all public business, and forsake the haunts of men. This were the retreat of a monk, not of a good and a wise man. Tranquillity were too dearly purchased by the neglect of those duties which belong to a man, and a Christian. Nor indeed in absolute seclusion from the world is tranquillity ever found. On the contrary, when the human mind is cut off from those employ∣ments for which it was designed by nature and Provi∣dence, it preys on itself, and engenders its own mis∣ery. Tranquillity is always most likely to be attain∣ed, when the business of the world is tempered with thoughtful and serious retreat. <HI>Commune with your hearts on your bed, and be still.</HI> Leaving this world to itself, let there be seasons which you devote to your∣selves, and to God. Reflection and meditation allay the workings of many unquiet passions; and place us at a distance from the tumults of the world. When the mind has either been ruffled or cast down, in in∣tercourse with God and heaven we find a sanctuary
<PB N="152" REF="028306_0157_0FD89585F9E27B40"/>to which we can retreat. In the hours of contem∣plation and devotion, a good man enjoys himself in peace. He beholds nobler objects than what worldly men can behold. He assumes a higher character. He listens to the voice of nature and of God; and from this holy sanctuary comes forth with a mind fortified against the little disturbances of the world. Such habits, therefore cannot be too much recom∣mended to the lovers of tranquillity, as powerful sub∣sidiary means for attaining that happy state.</P>
<P>I have thus pointed out what appears to me the dis∣cipline of religion and wisdom for tranquillity of mind. <HI>He that doth these things shall never be moved.</HI> During the early periods of life, vivid sensa∣tions of pleasure are the sole objects thought wor∣thy of pursuit. Mere ease and calmness are despised, as the portion of the aged only and the feeble. Some longer acquaintance with the world, with its disap∣pointed hopes and fallacious pleasures, teaches almost all men, by degrees, to wish for tranquillity and peace. But you must not imagine, that these are blessings which will drop on men of their own accord, as soon as they begin to desire them. No: the thoughtless, and the profligate, will ever remain strangers to them. They will remain the sport of every accident that oc∣curs to derange their minds, and to disturb their life. —The three great enemies to tranquillity are, Vice, Superstition, and Idleness: Vice which poisons and disturbs the mind with bad passions; Superstition, which fills it with imaginary terrors; Idleness, which loads it with tediousness and disgust. It is only by following the path which Eternal Wisdom has pointed out, that we can arrive at the blessed temple of Tranquillity, and obtain a station there: By doing, or at least endeavouring to do, our duty to God and man; by acquiring a humble trust in the mercy and
<PB N="153" REF="028306_0158_0FD8958779C513E8"/>favour of God through Jesus Christ; by cultivating our minds, and properly employing our time and thoughts; by governing our passions and our temper; by correcting all unreasonable expectations from the world, and from men; and, in the midst of world∣ly business, habituating ourselves to calm retreat and serious recollection.—By such means as these, it may be hoped, that, through the divine blessing, our days shall flow in a stream as unruffled as the human state admits. <HI>The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. But the work of righteousness is peace; and the effect of righteousness is quietness and assurance for ever.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxxii. 17.</NOTE></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW many complains do we hear from every quarter, of the misery and distress that fill the world! In these the high and the low, the young and the aged, join; and since the beginning of time, no topic has been more fertile of declamation, than the
<PB N="154" REF="028306_0159_0FD89589F80946A0"/>vanity and vexation which man is appointe to suffer. But are we certain that this vexation, and this vani∣ty, is altogether to be ascribed to the appointment of heaven? Is there no g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to suspect that man him∣self is the chief and immediate author of his own sufferings? What the text plainly suggests is, that it is common for men to complain groundlesly of Prov∣idence; that they are prone to accuse God for the evils of life, when in reason they ought to accuse them∣selves; and that after their <HI>foolishness</HI> hath <HI>perverted their way,</HI> and made them undergo the consequences of their own misconduct, they impiously <HI>fret in heart against the Lord.</HI> This is the doctrine which I now purpose to illustrate, in order to silence the sceptic, and to check a repining and irreligious spirit. I shall for this end make some observations, first, on the ex∣ternal, and next, upon the internal, condition of man; and then conclude with such serious and use∣ful improvement as the subject will naturally suggest.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us consider the external condition of man. We find him placed in a world where he has by no means the disposal of the events that happen. Cala∣mities sometimes besal the worthiest and the best, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is lest them, but to acknowledge and to sub∣mit to the high hand of Heaven. For such visitations of trial, many good and wise reasons can be assigned, which the present subject leads me not to discuss. But though those unavoidable calamities make a part yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and sorrows that distress human life. A multitude of evils beset us. for the source of which we must look to another quarter. — No sooner has any thing in the health, or in the circumstances of men, gone cross to their wish, than they begin to talk of the unequal distribution of the good things of this life; they envy
<PB N="155" REF="028306_0160_0FD8958BFAA7CEE0"/>the condition of others, they repine at their own lot, and fret against the Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>Full of these sentiments, one man pines under a broken constitution. But let us ask him, whether he can, fairly and honestly assign no cause for this but the unknow decree of heaven? Has he duly va∣lued the blessing of health, and always observed the rules of virtue and sobriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all his pleasures; If now he be only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to com∣plain, as if he were suffering unjustly? Were you to survey the chambers of sickness and distress, you would find them peopled with the victim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of intem∣perance and sensuality, and with the children of vici∣ous indolence and sloth. Among the thousands who languish there, you would find the proportion of in∣nocent sufferers to be small. You would see faded youth, premature old age, and the prospect of an un∣timely grave; to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought those evils on themselves; while yet these martyrs of vice and folly have the assurance to arraign the hard fate of man, and to <HI>fret against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But you, perhaps, complain of hardships of an∣other kind; of the injustice of the world; of the poverty which you suffer, and the discouragements under which you labour; of the crosses and disappointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.—Be∣fore you give too much scope to your discontent, let me disires you to reflect impartially upon your past train of life. Have not sloth, or pride, or ill temper, or sinful passions, misled you often from the path of sound and wise conduct? Have you not been wanting to yourselves in improving those opportunities which Providence offered you, for bettering and advancing
<PB N="156" REF="028306_0161_0FD8958D7B4FF9A8"/>your state? If you have chosen to indulge your hu∣mour, or your taste, in the gratifications of indolence or pleasure, can you complain because others, in pref∣erence to you, have obtained those advantages which naturally belong to useful labours, and honourable pursuits? Have not the consequences of some false steps, into which your passions, or, your pleasures, have betrayed you, pursued you through much of your life; tanted, perhaps, your character, involved you in embarassments or sunk you into neglect?—It is an old saying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world seldom turns wholly against a man, unless through his own fault. <HI>Godliness is,</HI> in general, <HI>profitable un∣to all things</HI> Virtue, diligence and industry, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the surest road to prosperity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of success is far oftener ow∣ing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered insuperable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being fickle and changeable, are distrusted by all.—The case com∣monly is, that men seek to ascribe their disappoint∣ments to any cause, rather than to their own miscon∣duct; and when they can devise no other cause, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices; their vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they <HI>fret against the Lord.</HI> They are doubly unjust towards God. In their prosperity, they are apt to ascribe their success to their own diligence, ra∣ther than to God's blessing; and in their adversity, they impute their distresses to his providence, not to their own misbehaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very reverse of this. <HI>Every good and every perfect gift com∣eth
<PB N="157" REF="028306_0162_0FD8958F4C370F58"/>from above;</HI> and of evil and misery, man is the author to himself.</P>
<P>When from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public state of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this assertion. We see great societies of men torn in pieces by intestine dis∣sensions, tumults, and civil commotions. We see mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, against each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils these are, to which this miserable world is exposed.—But are these evils, I beseech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who sent forth slaught∣ering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful city with massacres and blood? Are these miseries any other, than the bitter fruit of mens violent and disorderly passions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to the turbulence of the people?— Let us say them entirely out of the account, in think∣ing of Providence; and let us think only of the <HI>foolish∣ness of men.</HI> Did man controul his passions, and form his conduct according to the dictates of wisdom, hu∣manity and virtue, the earth would no longer be de∣solated by cruelty; and human societies would live in order, harmony and peace. In those scenes of mischief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with shame, the picture of his vices, his ig∣norance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own <HI>perverseness;</HI> but let not <HI>his heart fret against the Lord.</HI>—From the external condition, let us proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the internal state of man. It is certain that much disquiet and misery may be found there, although his outward condition appear undis∣turbed, and easy. As far as this inward disquietude
<PB N="158" REF="028306_0163_0FD89590807DC738"/>arises from the stings of conscience, and the horrors of guilt, there can be no doubt of its being self-cre∣ated misery; which it is altogether impossible to im∣pute to Heaven. But even, when great crimes, and deep remorse, are not the occasions of torment, how often is poison infused into the most flourishing con∣ditions of fortune, by the follies and the passions of the prosperous? We see them peevish and restless; corrupted with luxury, and enervated by ease; im∣patient of the smallest disappointment oppressed with low spirits, and complaining of every thing around them. How many <HI>Hamans, Hazaels,</HI> and <HI>Herods,</HI> are there in the world, who, from that they suffer within, pass their days in more vexation and misery, than they who undergo the hardships of poverty? Dare such men, in their most discontented moments, charge the providence of Heaven with miseries of their own procuring? Providence had put into their hands the fairest opportunity of passing their life with com∣fort. But they themselves blasted every comfort that was offered; and verified the prediction, that <HI>the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>As it is man's own <HI>foolishness</HI> which ruins his pros∣perity, we must not omit to remark, that it is the same cause which aggravates and embitters his adver∣sity. That you suffer from the external afflictions of the world, may often be owing to God's appoint∣ment; but when, in the midst of these, you also suf∣fer from the disorders of your mind and passions, this is owing to yourselves; and they are those inward disorders which add the severest sting to external af∣flictions. Many are the resources of a good and a wise man, under all the disasters of life. In the midst of them, it is always in his power to enjoy
<PB N="159" REF="028306_0164_0FD89591F9A90450"/>peace of mind, and hope in God. He may suffer; but under suffering he will not sink, as long as all is sound within. But when the spirit has been wound∣ed by guilt and folly, its wounds open, and bleed afresh, upon every blow that is received from the world. The mind becomes sensible and sore to the slightest injuries of fortune; and a small reverse is felt as an insupportable calamity.</P>
<P>On the whole; the farther you search into human life, and the more you observe the manners and the conduct of men, you will be the more convinced of this great truth, that of the distresses which abound in the world, we are the chief authors. Among the multitudes who are, at this day, bewailing their con∣dition and lot, it will be found to hold of far the greater part, that they are reaping the <HI>fruit of their own doings; their iniquities are reproving them, and their backslidings correcting them.</HI> Unattainable ob∣jects foolishly pursued, intemperate passions nourish∣ed, vicious pleasures and desires indulged, God and God's holy laws forgotten; these, these are the great scourges of the world; the great causes of the life of man being so embroiled and unhappy. God hath ordained our state on earth to be a mixed and imper∣fect state. We have ourselves to blame for its be∣coming an insupportable one. If it bring forth no∣thing to us but vexation and vanity, we have sown the seeds of that vanity and vexation; and as we have sown, we must reap.—I now proceed to make im∣provement of those truths which we have been con∣sidering.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, let us be taught, to look upon sin as the source of all our miseries. It may some∣times assume the gentler names of folly, irregularity, or levity; but under whatever form it appears, it al∣ways imports a deviation from that sacred law which
<PB N="160" REF="028306_0165_0FD89593C127AB68"/>ought to regulate our conduct. It is still the <HI>root that beareth gall and wormwood;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxix. 18.</NOTE> and in exact pro∣portion to the quantity of this poisonous weed, which we ourselves have infused into our cup, we must ex∣pect to drink the waters of bitterness. If the <HI>foolish∣ness of man</HI> did not <HI>pervert his ways,</HI> his heart would have no occasion to <HI>fret against the Lord.</HI> He would enjoy competent satisfaction in every situation of life; and under its unavoidable evils, would derive consola∣tion from religion and virtue.—Indeed, of every evil which we now endure, of those evils which we look upon to be the appointment of providence, as well as of others, sin is ultimately the cause; as it was man's revolt from God, which gave rise original∣ly to those evils, and which rendered the chastisements we undergo, in this state of discipline, necessary, even for the <HI>sons of God.</HI>—But at present, we confine our observation to those miseries of which men are the immediate procurers to themselves; and from them alone, we find sufficient reason to consider sin as the capital foe to man; as the great troubler and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urb∣er of his life. To Providence, then, let us look up with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everence. On sin let our indignation be vent∣ed; and, what is of more consequence, against sin and all its approaches, let our utmost caution be em∣ployed. As we proceed through the different paths of life, let us accustom ourselves to beware of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as the hidden snake lurking among the grass, from whose fatal touch we must fly in haste, if we would not ex∣perience its sting.—Too many have no just ap∣prehensions of this danger. <HI>Fools,</HI> said the wise man <HI>make a mock at sin.</HI> A fool indeed he must be, who dares to think lightly of it. He shows not only the depravity of his heart, but, what perhaps he will be
<PB N="161" REF="028306_0166_0FD8959680EAF088"/>more ashamed to be charged with, he shows his igno∣rance of the world. He shows that he knows not, he understands not, even his worldly interest, nor the interest and happiness of human society.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, let us learn from what has been set forth, one of the most awful and important of all truths, the reality of a divine government exer∣cised over the world. Blind must that man be, who discerns not the most striking marks of it, in the doc∣trine which has been under our review. If there be a sceptic, who contends, that unrestrained liberty in the gratification of desire is given to man; that in the sight of his Creator, all actions are equal; and that no rule of moral conduct hath been prescribed, or by any penalty enforced; in order to confute such a man, we have not recourse to reasonings, but sim∣ply appeal to plain and obvious facts. We bid him look only to the life of man; and take notice how every vice, is by the constitution of things, connected with misery. We bid him trace the history of any one, with whose conduct he had particular occasion to be acquainted; and observe, whether the chief misfortunes which pursued him were not brought up∣on him by his own misbehaviour. We bid him re∣mark in the history of nations, whether public virtue has not always exalted them; and whether licentious∣ness and crimes have not paved the way for their ru∣in. These are testimonies to the truth of religion, which cannot by any sophistry be evaded. This is a voice, which speaks its warnings loud and strong to every heart.</P>
<P>The system upon which the divine government at present proceeds, plainly is, that mens <HI>own wickedness</HI> should be appointed to <HI>correct them;</HI> that sinners should <HI>be snared in the work of their hands, and sunk in the pit which themselves had digged: that the backslider in heart
<PB N="162" REF="028306_0167_0FD89597FB0A8850"/>should be silled with his own ways.</HI>—Of all the plan; which could have been devised for the government of the world, this approves itself to reason, as the wise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and most worthy of God; so to frame the con∣stitution of things, that the divine laws should in a manner execute themselves, and carry their sanctions in their own bosom. When the vices of men require punishment to be inflicted, the Almighty is at no loss for ministers of justice. A thousand instruments of vengeance are at his command; innumerable arrows are always in his quiver. But such is the profound wisdom of his plan, that no peculiar interposals of power are requisite. He has no occasion to step from his throne, and to interrupt the order of nature. With that Majesty and solemnity which befits om∣nipotence, He pronounces, <HI>Ephraim is joined to his, idols; let him alone;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a iv. 17.</NOTE> He leaves transgressors to their own guilt, and punishment follows of course. Their sins do the work of justicè. They lift the scourge; and with every stroke which they inflict on the crim∣inal, they mix this severe admonition, that as he is only reaping the fruit of his own actions, he deserves all that he suffers.—From what has been said, I might take occasion,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, to show the injustice of our charging Providence with a promiscuous and unequal distribution of its favours, among the good and the bad. That unequal distribution takes place in ap∣pearance only, not in reality. The whole conduct of Providence sufficiently marks, which of those class∣es of men it blesses and protects. The prosperity of sinners is no more than a deceitful show. The great materials of happiness are provided for the virtuous; and <HI>evil</HI> never faits to <HI>pursue the wicked.</HI> I shall close the discourse with observing,</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="028306_0168_0FD8959985706138"/>
In the <HI>fourth</HI> and last place, the necessity which plain∣ly arises from our present condition, of looking up to God for direction and aid, in the conduct of life. The result of the whole doctrine I have now deliver∣ed is, that man's happiness or misery is, in a great measure, put into his own hands. In vain he com∣plains of Providence. If his <HI>heart fret against the Lord,</HI> it is only because <HI>his foolishness hath perverted his way:</HI> for on himself, and his own behaviour, it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pends, to be free of those miseries which harrass the wicked.—But alas! when we say that this depends upon man, on what uncertain ground do we place his security? Is man, when left to himself, equal to this high trust that is reposed in him, this important charge that is committed to him, of attaining happiness, by wise and irreproachable conduct? Inconstant as he is in virtue, variable in his resolutions, soft and yield∣ing in his nature to a thousand temptations; how shall he guide himself through such slippery and dangerous paths as those of human life; where many hidden precipices surrounded him; many false lights lead him astray; and where the consequence of every step he takes may be destruction and ruin?—Thankful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us be to heaven, that in this situation, a merciful guide stretches out his hand to aid us; that a celestial light shines upon us from above; that a divine Spirit is promised to illuminate and strengthen us. Let us humbly request of Heaven, that this Spirit of the Almighty may ever be our guide; never presum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ously trusting in our own wisdom; but listening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tentively to the voice of God; and <HI>in all our ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knowledging Him</HI> who only can <HI>direct our steps.</HI>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the whole, let us hold fast the persuasion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fundamental truths;—that in all his dispensati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God is just and good; that the cause of all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣bles we suffer is in ourselves, not in him; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="164" REF="028306_0169_0FD8959B0A1F4348"/>is the surest guide to a happy life; that he who forsakes this guide, enters upon the path of death; but that he who <HI>walketh uprightly, walketh surely;</HI> and that he who <HI>keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul.</HI></P>

<P>The integrity of the upright shall guide them.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>RIGHTEOUSNESS and sin are, in this book of Proverbs. frequently contrasted with each other, and the advantages of the former displayed. The righteous man in shown to be <HI>more excellent than his neighbour,</HI> as <HI>the ways in which he walks are ways of pleasantness,</HI> while <HI>the way of transgressors is hard.</HI> Honour is repesented as attending the one, while shame is the portion of the other. The path of the one leads to life; that of the other to distruction. In the text, an advantage of righteousness is specified, which is not commonly attended to, and which some will not readily allow that it possesses. We are told by the wise man, that it affords light and direction to conduct, and will prove our best guide through all the intricacies of life. <HI>The integrity of the upright shall guide them;</HI> or, as it is added, to the same purpose, in a following verse, <HI>the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way.</HI> There are many who will admit, that integrity is an amiable quality; that it is entit∣led
<PB N="165" REF="028306_0170_0FD8959C7ACBA2C0"/>to much respect, and in most cases ought to influ∣ence our behaviour; who nevertheless are unwilling to allow it the chief place in the direction of their worldly conduct. They hold, that a certain artful sagacity, founded upon knowledge of the world, is the best conductor of every one, who would be a suc∣cessful adventurer in life; and that a strict attention to integrity, as his only guide, would often lead him into danger and distress. In opposition to tenets of this kind, I now purpose to show, that amidst all per∣plexities and dangers, there is no guide we can chuse so safe, and so successful on the whole, as the integ∣rity of an upright mind; and that upon every trying occasion, principles of probity and honour will con∣duct a good man through life with more advantage, than if he were to act upon the most refined system of worldly wisdom.</P>
<P>It will not take much time to delineate the char∣acter of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and easily understood. He is one, who makes it his constant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his conscience, point it out to him. He is not guided merely by affections, which may sometimes give the colour of virtue to a loose and unstable character. The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determins him to steem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is base and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence you find him ever the same; at all times, the trusty friend, the affectionate relation, the conscientious man of business, the pious worshipper, the public spirited citizen. He assumes no borrowed appearance. He seeks no mask to cover him; for he acts no studied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art; but he is in truth what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his pursuits,
<PB N="166" REF="028306_0171_0FD8959E03B0EE58"/>he knows no path but the fair and direct one; and would much rather fail of success, than attain it by reproachful means. He never shows you a smiling countenance, while he mediates evil against you in his heart. He never praises you among your friends; and then joins in traducing you among your enemies. You will never find one part of his character at vari∣ance with another. In his manners, he is simple and unaffected; in all his proceedings, open and consist∣ent.—Such is the man of integrity spoken of in the text. Let us now proceed to show, in what manner, and with what effect, integrity serves for the guide of his life.</P>
<P>Every one, who has begun to make any progress in the world, will be sensible, that to conduct him∣self in human affairs with wisdom and propriety, is often a matter of no small difficulty. Amidst that variety of characters, of jarring dispositions, and of interfering interests, which take place among those with whom we have intercourse, we are frequently at a stand, as to the part most prudent for us to chuse. Igno∣rant of what is passing in the breasts of those around us, we can form no more than doubtful conjectures con∣cerning the events that are likely to happen. They may take some turn altogether different from the course in which we had imagined they were to run, and according to which we had formed our plans. The slightest incident often shoots out into import∣ant consequences, of which we were not aware. The labyrinth becomes so intricate, that the most sagaci∣ous can lay hold on no clue to guide him through it: He finds himself embarrassed, and at a loss how to act.—In public and in private life, in managing our own concerns, and in directing those of others, the doubt started by the Wise man frequently occurs; <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</HI>—While
<PB N="167" REF="028306_0172_0FD8959F82311C88"/>thus fatigued with conjecture, we remain perplexed and undetermined in our choice; we are at the same time pulled to different sides, by the various emoti∣ons which belong to our nature. On one hand, pleasure allures us to what is agreeable; on the other, interest weighs us down towards what seems gainful. Honour attracts us towards what is splendid; and indolence inclines us to what is easy. In the consultations which we hold with our own mind, concerning our conduct, how often are we thus divided within ourselves; puzzled by the un∣certainty of future events, and distracted by the con∣test of different inclinations?</P>
<P>It is in such situations as these, that the principle of integrity interposes to give light and direction. While worldly men fluctuate in the midst of those perplexities which I have described, the virtuous man has one Oracle, to which he resorts in every dubious case, and whose decisions he holds to be infallible: He cousults his conscience. He listens to the voice of God. Were it only on a few occasions that this Oracle could be consulted, its value would be less. But it is a mistake to imagine, that its Responses are seldom given. Hardly is there any material transac∣tion whatever in human life, any important question, that holds us in suspence as to practice, but the dif∣ference between right and wrong will show itself; and the principle of integrity will, if we listen to it impartially, give a clear decision. Whenever the mind is divided within itself, conscience is seldom or never neutral. There is always one side or other to which it leans. There is always one scale of the balance, into which it throws the weight of <HI>some vir∣tue; or some praise:</HI> of something that is <HI>just and true lovely, honest, and of good report.</HI> These are the forms, which to the observation of the upright man. By
<PB N="168" REF="028306_0173_0FD895A1000DBF88"/>others they may be unseen or overlooked; but in his eye, the lustre of virtue outshines all other brightness, Wherever this pole star directs him, he steadily holds his course.—Let the issue of that course be ever so uncertain; let his friends differ from him in opinion; let his enemies clamour; he is not moved; his pur∣pose is fixed. He asks but one question of his heart, what is the most worthy and honourable part; what is the part most becoming the station which he possesses, the character which he wishes to bear the expectati∣ons which good men entertain of him? Being once decided as to this, he hesitates no more. He shuts his ears against every solicitation. He pursues the direct line of integrity, without <HI>turning either to the right hand or to the left.</HI><Q>It is the Lord who cal∣leth. Him I follow. Let him order what seem∣eth good in his sight.</Q>—It is in this manner that the <HI>integrity of the upright</HI> acts as <HI>their guide.</HI></P>
<P>But as, upon a superficial view, it may appear haz∣ardous to place ourselves entirely under such a guide, let us now proceed to consider what can be said in de∣fence of this plan of conduct, and what advantages serve to recommend it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, I affirm, that the guidance of in∣tegrity is the safest under which we can be placed; that the road in which it leads us is, upon the whole, the freest from dangers. Perfect immunity from dan∣ger is not to be expected in this life. We can chose no path, in which we may not meet with disappoint∣ments and misfortunes. Our life, at the best, is a pilgrimage, and perils surround it. Against these perils, the men of the world imagine that craft and dexterity furnish the best defence; and if, in any in∣stance, they over-reach the upright, they consider it as a manifest decision in favour of their plan. But instead of resting on a few instances, let us take an
<PB N="169" REF="028306_0174_0FD895A28843F398"/>extensive survey of the course of human affairs. Let us enquire who the persons are that, in all the differ∣ent lines of life, have gone through the world with most success; and we shall find, that the men of prob∣ity and honour form by far the most considerable part of the list; we shall find that men of plain under∣standing, acting upon fair and direct views, have much oftener prospered, than men of the deepest policy, who were devoid of principle. How few are the in∣stances of persons who by fidelity, worth, and stead∣fast adherence to their duty, have either lost their for∣tunes, or incurred general displeasure, in times when human affairs were proceeding in their ordinary train? But how numerous and frequent are the examples of those whose prospects have been blasted, whose cir∣cumstances have been ruined, and their names sunk into contempt by vice and dishonesty?</P>
<P>The man of the world aims at higher things, and more rapid success, than the man of moderation and virtue. But at the same time, he incurs greater risques and dangers. No calculation of probabilities can ensure safety to him who is acting a deceitful part. Amidst the unforeseen vicissitudes of the world, he has to dread, not only disappointment to his plans, but the miseries also which detected fallacies may bring on his dead. He walks on the edge of preci∣pices, where a single false step may be fatal. He fol∣lows a wandering light, which, if it fail of guiding him by a short path to the Palace of ambition, lands him in the pit, or the lake. Whereas he who fol∣lows the guidance of integrity, walks in the high road on which the light of the sun shines. He sees before him the Habitation of peace to which his steps are directed; and if he be longer of arriving at it, he is
<PB N="170" REF="028306_0175_0FD895A4CDDC6A88"/>sure of neither wandering far astray, nor of meeting on his road with any forms of unusual terror.— Let it be always remembered that the principle of in∣tegrity which directs a good man, is far from exclu∣ding prudence in the conduct of life. It implies no improvident or thoughtless simplicity. On the con∣trary, it is closely connected with true wisdom. A man of enlarged capacity, and extensive views, is al∣ways upright. Craft is merely the supplement of in∣ferior abilities. It characterizes a narrow compre∣hension, and a little mind.—As the path of integ∣rity is on the whole the safest path of conduct; so,</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, it is unquestionably the most honourable. Integrity is the foundation of all that is high in character among mankind. Other quali∣ties may add to its splendor; but if this essential re∣quisite be wanting, all their lustre fades. Were I drawing the character of one who claimed the admi∣ration of the world; and after I had ascribed to him eloquence, valour, and every endowment that is most shining and captivating, did I add, that he was a man of too much art to be trusted, I appeal to every one, whether, by this single stroke, the whole character would not be sunk and degraded? An interested and crafty man may perhaps rise into influence and high station; he may be a rich and a powerful, but will never be a great, man. He may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eared, and exter∣nally honoured and courted; but in the secret thoughts of men he finds no respect. We all feel, that mag∣nanimous sentiments cannot dwell in the same breast with selfishness and deceit.</P>
<P>He who rests upon an internal principle of virtue and honour, will act with a dignity and a boldness, of which they are incapable who are wholly guided by interest. He is above those timid suspicions, and cau∣tious
<PB N="171" REF="028306_0176_0FD895A6927CBA20"/>restraints, which fetter and embarrass their con∣duct. That firmness which the consciousness of rec∣titude in spirits, gives vigour and force to his exertions on every great occasion. It adds double weight to all the abilities of which he is possest. It even sup∣plies the place of those abilities in which he is defec∣tive. They who oppose him are obliged to honour him. They look up to him with a secret awe, as to one who moves above them in a superior sphere; re∣gardless of their good or ill opinion, of their prom∣ises or their threatenings; like one of those celestial luminaries which holds its course through its orbit, without being affected by any commotions among the elements below. Such a man is trusted, and re∣lied upon, as well as esteemed, because all know where to find him, and upon what system he acts. He at∣taches friends and followers to himself, without court∣ing them; and though his progress towards fame should be slow, and interrupted at first by crooked arts, it is nevertheless certain and sure. The public may be misled for a while, in judging of real merit; but it is seldom unjust at the last. As persons continue to come forward to view, and to act their part in trying circumstances, their characters are at length sully ascertained; and, almost always, rated as they deserve. How corrupt soever the world may be, they cannot with hold approbation from him, whose con∣duct is marked by unifor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> integrity and honour. Enemies he will have; but the public favours him; the multitude of men wish him success; and destine him, in their thoughts, to every step of his prefer∣ment, before he arrives at it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, the plan of conduct, on which the man of integrity proceeds is the most comforta∣ble; that is, attended with the great at satisfaction in a man's own mind. Amidst the various and per∣plexing
<PB N="172" REF="028306_0177_0FD895A7BB994F18"/>events of life, it is of singular advantage to be kept free from doubt, as to the part most proper to be chosen. He who consults nothing but worldly interest must, upon every turn of fortune, undergo much painful suspence. He is obliged to listen with anxious ear to every whisper of report; and upon every new aspect which the face of affairs assumes, must study how to place himself in a new posture of defence. But the man of principle is a stranger to these inward troubles. His time is not lost; nor his temper fretted by long and anxious consultations. One light always shines upon him from above. One path, the path of integrity, always opens clear and distinct to his view.—But this is not his only advantage, to be freed from embarrassments, by having placed him∣self under the charge of one constant guide. He is also rewarded with the sense of having chosen his guide well and wisely. He is delivered from all in∣ward upbraidings, from all misgivings of mind, from all alarms founded on the dread of discovery and dis∣grace. A good conscience enables him to look back on the part which he has acted with satisfaction; and to look forward to the issue which it may bring, with∣out concern. It is in the case of one issue only, that the man who acts from worldy interest can enjoy sat∣isfaction; that is when his designs have succeeded according to his wish. But it is the felicity of the man who acts under the direction of integrity, that in every issue, he has something to comfort him. Though success has failed him, the consolation re∣mains of having done his duty, and studied to approve himself to God.</P>
<P>This reference of all his actions to divine appro∣bation, furnishes another source of satisfaction and peace. He looks up, with pleasing hope, to a Pro∣tector in the heavens, who <HI>loveth righteousness, and
<PB N="173" REF="028306_0178_0FD895A944A6CBC0"/>whose countenance beholdeth the upright.</HI> The man of worldly wisdom is conscious of having no title to the favour of that high administration which rules the universe. By quitting the path of righteousness he has left that straight road, in which God had appoint∣ed him to walk. He has taken the direction of his way to himself; and chosen to be his own guide and master. To his own abilities, therefore, such as they are, he must trust; and is become wholly respon∣sible for the issue of his conduct. But the man of virtue hath <HI>committed his way to the Lord.</HI> He follows the divine signal. He co-operates with the divine purpose. The power which sways the universe is engaged on his side. By natural consequence, he has ground to expect, that any seeming disappointments which he may now incur, shall be over-ruled at the end to some salutary effect. Hence, that <HI>peace of God keeping the heart,</HI> to which worldly men are strangers Hence a degree of firmness and resolution in conduct, which it is impossible for them to possess. Especially when we add,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> and last place, that he who thus pursues a course of integrity, has always in his view the pros∣pect of immortal rewards. That surely is the wis∣est direction of conduct, which is most amply recom∣pensed at last. But what recompense can worldly wisdom bestow, comparable to what is promised by the gospel to them who, <HI>by patient continuance in well doing, look for glory, honour, and immortality?</HI>—The recompense indeed is distant; but the hope of it is present; and hope is one of the most powerful prin∣ciples of human action. Let a man be firm in the belief that he is acting under the immediate protec∣tion of Heaven, and that through all eternity he shall be rewarded for what he now performs; and, as far as this belief is prevalent, his conduct will be steady
<PB N="174" REF="028306_0179_0FD895ABB5D69F90"/>and determined. Wherever religion directs him to hold his course, he will advance with intrepidity. He will submit to restraints without reluctance. He will meet dangers without fear. To every motive which reason suggests in favour of virtue, the hope of life eternal adds supernatural strength.—Accord∣ingly, in the behaviour of many holy men under the most trying circumstances of distress, we behold this effect eminently exemplified. It appears, with much lustre, in the spirited and magnanimous sentiments of the Apostle Paul, when he had the prospect of death before him. <HI>Behold I go bound in the Spirit to Jeru∣salem, not knowing the things that shall befal me there, save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth that bonds and af∣flictions abide me. But none of these things move me; nei∣ther count I my life dear unto myself, so that I may fin∣ish my course with joy.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 22.</NOTE>—<HI>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Timothy iv. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to show in what manner the <HI>integrity of the upright guides them;</HI> and what the advantages are of placing ourselves under its guid∣ance. If it be the line of safety, or the line of honour, which we chuse to pursue; if we consult our present comfort, or look forward to future rewards; in all these respects, the course which integrity points out is by far the most eligible.</P>
<P>It is a great recommendation of the guidance offered to us by integrity, that it is easily understood by all men. Plans of worldly policy are deep and intricate; and experience shows how often the ablest persons are
<PB N="175" REF="028306_0180_0FD895AD076FA408"/>mistaken in the measures which they adopt for carry∣ing them on. But when men's intentions are fair and upright, it will be found, that a moderate share of understanding and attention is all that is requisite, for conducting themselves with safety and propriety. Providence never intended, that the art of living hap∣pily in this world should depend on that deep pene∣tration, that acute sagacity, and those refinements of thought, which few possess. It has dealt more gra∣ciously with us; and made happiness to depend on uprightness of intention, much more than on extent of capacity. For the most part, the first sentiment which strikes a good man, concerning what he ought or ought not to do, is the soundest, and suggests the best and wisest counsel. When he hesitates, and be∣gins to deliberate how far his duty, or his honour, can be reconciled to what seems his interest, he is on the point of deviating into a dangerous path.—At the same time, it is of great consequence, that he who seeks to surrender his conduct to the direction of in∣tegrity, should be well apprized of what true integrity requires. Let him guard against burdening consci∣ence unnecessarily; lest a superstitious regard to tri∣fles lead him to relax in matters of higher obligation. Let him avoid minute scrupulosity, on the one hand. Let him keep at a distance from loose casuistry, on the other. But when he is satisfied that his conscience has been well informed, let him, without wavering, adhere to its dictates in the whole of his conduct. This will prove the truest wisdom both for this world and the next. For <HI>he who walketh uprightly walketh surely. The path of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts as the shining light;</HI> And it shall <HI>shine more and more unto the perfect day.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB ii. 10.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FEW subjects of religions exhortation are of more general concern than those which respect the distresses incident to human life. For no society, no family, no person, can expect to be long exempted from them; and when we speak of the prosperous, we can only mean those who are more rarely subject to them than others. Now, under those distresses, religion performs two offices: It teaches us how we ought to bear them; and it assists us in thus bearing them. Materials for both are found in the words of the text, which contain a sentiment so natural and just, as to carry conviction to every reasonable mind. They were the words of Job, at a time when, to his other calamities, this domestic affliction was added, that one, who ought to have assuaged and soothed his sorrows, provoked his indignation by an impious speech. <HI>Thou speakest,</HI> Job replies, <HI>as one of the foolish women speaketh: What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?</HI>—Three in∣structions naturally arise from the text: First, That this life is a mixed state of good and evil: Secondly,
<PB N="177" REF="028306_0182_0FD895B02AE5C7F0"/>That both the goods and the evils in it proceed from God: And, thirdly, That there are just reasons for our receiving with patience the evils of life, from the same hand which bestows its goods.</P>
<P N="1">I. This life is a mixed state of good and evil. This is a matter of fact, which will be denied by none, and on which it is not necessary to bestow much illus∣tration. It is evident to the slightest inspection, that nothing here is unallayed and pure. Every man's state is checquered with alternate griefs and joys, dis∣appointment and success. No condition is altoge∣ther stable. No life preserves always the same tenor. The vicissitudes of the world sometimes bring for∣ward the afflicted into comfortable circumstances; and often trouble the joy of the prosperous. This is the train in which human affairs have ever been found to proceed; and in which we may expect them always to go on.</P>
<P>But though this be universally admitted in specula∣tion, and often confessed in discourse, the misfortune is, that few think of applying it to their own case. The bulk of mankind discover as much confidence in prosperity, and as much impatience under the least re∣verse, as if Providence had first given them assurance that their prosperity was never to change, and after∣wards had cheated their hopes. Whereas, what reason ought to teach us, is, to adjust our mind to the mix∣ed state in which we find ourselves placed; never to presume, never to despair; to be thankful for the goods which at present we enjoy, and to expect the evils that may succeed.—Thou hast been admitted to partake of the feast of life. Its good things are dis∣tributed. in various portions, among the guests. Thou hast had thine allotted share. Complain not, when thy portion is removed. It is not permitted to any, to remain always at the banquet.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="178" REF="028306_0183_0FD895B254E453E0"/>
II. We are taught by the text, that both the goods and the evils which compose this mixed state, come from the hand of God. A little reflection may con∣vince us, that, in God's world, neither good nor evil can happen by chance. If there were any one mo∣ment, in which God quitted the reins of the universe, and suffered any power to interfere with his administra∣tion, it is evident, that from that moment, the measures of his government must become disjointed and incom∣plete. He who governs all things, must govern con∣tinually; and govern the least things as well as the greatest. <HI>He never slumbers nor sleeps.</HI> There are no void spaces, no broken plans, in his administra∣tion; no blessings that drop upon us without his in∣tention; nor any crosses that visit us unsent by him. <HI>I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness, I moke peace, and create evil. I the Lord do all these things.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xlv. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>How it has come to pass, that this life should con∣tain such a mixture of goods and evils, and that the mixture too should be of God's appointment, gives rise to a difficult inquiry. For how can any thing but what is good proceed from the God of love? Can darkness issue from the source of light? or can it be any satisfaction to the <HI>Father of mercies,</HI> to behold the sorrows of creatures whom he has made?—Here there was room for much perplexity, till revelation inform∣ed us, that the mixture of evils in man's estate is ow∣ing to man himself. Had he continued as God ori∣ginally made him, he would have received nothing but good from his Creator. His apostasy and cor∣ruption opened the gates of the taben ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> darkness. Misery issued forth, and has ever s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e pursued him. In the present condition of his nature, that misery is
<PB N="179" REF="028306_0184_0FD87F83C5306650"/>partly punishment, partly trial. He is become inca∣pable of bearing uninterrupted prosperity; and by the mixture of evils in his lot, merciful designs are carri∣ed on for his improvement and restoration.</P>
<P>What the text leads us at present to consider is, the effect that will follow from imitating the exam∣ple of Job, and refering to the hand of the Almighty, the evils which we suffer, as well as the good, which we enjoy. Such a reference of the distressful events of our life to the appointment of Heaven, not only is a duty which piety requires, but tends also to miti∣gate distress, and to suggest consolation. For to dwell, as is too commonly done, upon the instru∣ments and subordinate means of our trouble, is fre∣quently the cause of much grief, and much sin. When we view our sufferings as proceeding merely from our fellow-creatures, the part which they have acted in bringing them upon us, is often more grating than the suffering itself. The unreasonableness, perhaps, of an enemy, the treachery of a friend, the ingratitude or insolence of one whom we had much obliged, add weight to a load laid upon us by means so pro∣voking. The thoughts of their malignity, or of our own neglect in guarding against it, serve to poison the sore. Whereas, if instead of looking to men, we be∣held the cross as coming from God, these aggravat∣ing circumstances would effect us less; we would feel no more than our proper burden; we would submit to it more patiently; and many resources would open to us, as shall in a little be shown, from thinking of the hand that lays it on. Had Job, when despoiled of all his substance, thought of nothing but the Chal∣deans and Sabeans who robbed him, with what vio∣lent passions would he have been transported, and with what eager desires of revenge tormented? Whereas, considering them as rods and instruments
<PB N="180" REF="028306_0185_0FD895B3BB239278"/>only in the divine hand, and receiving the correction as from the Almighty himself, the tumult of his mind subsided; and with respectful composure he could say, <HI>The Lord gave; and the Lord hath taken away: Bles∣sed be the name of the Lord.</HI> This leads me,</P>
<P N="3">III. To consider the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and most important instruction, arising from the text; namely, that there are many reasons why we, who receive good from the hand of God, should receive with patience the evils which he is pleased to inflict. This is strongly con∣veyed by that interrogatory form of speech, in which the sentiment of Job is expressed: <HI>What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not re∣ceive evil?</HI> In order to unfold all that is contained in this appeal made to every man's conscience, let us consider,</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, that the good things which God has bestowed, afford sufficient evidence for our be∣lieving, that the evils which he sends, are not cause∣lessly or wantonly inflicted. Did we live in a world which bore the marks of a malicious or cruel govern∣or, there might be reason for distrusting every step of his conduct. But in the world which we inhabit, we behold, on the contrary, plain marks of predomi∣nant goodness. We behold the structure of the uni∣verse, the order of nature, the general course of Pro∣vidence, obviously arranged with a benevolent regard to the welfare of men. All the art and contrivance of which the divine works are full, point to this end; and the more they are explored, create the firmer be∣lief, that the goodness of the Deity gave rise to the system of creation. What is the conclusion to be thence drawn, but that in such parts of the divine administration as appear to us harsh and severe, the same goodness continues to preside, though exer∣cised in a hidden and mysterious manner?</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="028306_0186_0FD895B53A6D3EB0"/>
Let me desire you to consider, whether, if some powerful friend had placed you in an opulent and comfortable station, and, in the general conduct of your affairs, had discovered the most disinterested kindness, you would not ascribe any occasional dis∣couragements you received, to some unknown reason or cause, rather than to his unfaithfulness or cruelty? Ought not the experience which we have had, and the discovery which all nature affords, of the divine good∣ness, lead us to put a like construction on the evils which we suffer from a hand that hath so frequently loaded us with good?—Have we forgotten, in the midst of our complaints, who brought us unto the light of day; who watched over our helpless infancy; who reared our growing childhood; and through ten thousand surrounding dangers, has been our pro∣tector and guardian until this day? How often has he rescued us from sickness and death, and made our hearts glad with unexpected comforts? Now, that some cloud is thrown over our prosperity, or some blessing withdrawn, in which for a time we had re∣joiced, can we imagine that there is no good cause for this change of his proceeding? Shall we suspect that this nature is entirely altered? <HI>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mer∣cies?</HI> No, let us say with the Psalmist. <HI>This is my infir∣mity; but I will remember the works of the Lord. I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. lxxvii. ix. 10.</NOTE>—One signal work of the most High, at least, let us remember, and rejoice in the remembrance of it; even that final remedy which he has provided for all the evils occasioned by sin, in the redemption of the world accomplished by Jesus Christ. <HI>He who spar∣ed not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</HI> will
<PB N="182" REF="028306_0187_0FD895B6C978F510"/>he, in any case, wantonly afflict the children of men with superfluous and unnecessary sorrows? Is not this a proof so satisfactory, so express and demonstrative, of the gracious purposes of God, as should dispose us to take in good part, every thing which proceeds from him? Consider,</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, that the good things we receive from God are undeserved, the evils we suffer are just∣ly merited. Every reasonable person must feel the weight of this consideration, for producing patience and submission. For, though to suffer at any rate be grievous, yet to suffer unjustly, is doubly galling. Whereas, when one receives a mixed portion, where∣of the goods are above his deserts, and the evils below his deserts, to complain, in such a case, is unreason∣able; there is no more ground for being thankful. —All, it is true, have not deserved evil equally. Yet all of us deserve it moreor less; and to merit good at the hand of the Lord, is what none of us can pretend. At the best we are but <HI>unprofitable servants.</HI> Even this is more than we are entitled to claim. For if God were to <HI>enter into judgment</HI> with us, who could stand before him? who could justify himself in his sight? When the most inoffensive compare their conduct with God's holy law; when they reflect upon the du∣ties they have omitted, and the actual guilt they have contracted, they will find more reason to accuse them∣selves, than to complain of the divine chastisements. Whatever innocence any of us may plead, nay, whatever merit we may claim, with respect to men and the world, we suffer no more than what we de∣serve from the Governor of the world; and of his displeasure, we know that the wrath of man is no other than the instrument.</P>
<P>Not only all of us have done evil, but, what ought to be particularly attended to, God has a just title to
<PB N="183" REF="028306_0188_0FD895B84E2C0D40"/>punish us for it. Although a man know that he de∣serves punishment, yet he will not allow every one to inflict it. A child will submit to his parents, a servant to his master, a subject to the magistrate, when he would not bear correction from another hand. But no parent can have so complete a right to author∣ity over his children, no master over his servants, no magistrate over his subjects, as the Almighty hath over us. When we were born, we brought nothing with us into God's world. During our continuance in it, we have lived on the good things which God was pleased to lend us; and of which, God and our own conscience know that we have made but a sorry improvement. When he thinks proper to take any of them away, no wrong is done us; for they were not ours. To have enjoyed them so long, was a favour. To enjoy them always, was what we neither deserved, nor had any title to ex∣pect.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, the good things which at differ∣ent times we have received and enjoyed, are much greater than the evils which we suffer. Of this fact, I am sensible it will be difficult to persuade the afflic∣ted. But would they weigh, in a fair balance, the whole of their circumstances, they would find it true. Whatever persons feel at the present, makes so strong an impression upon them, as very commonly to ob∣literate the memory of all the past. When one is op∣pressed with some painful disease in his body, or wrung with some sore distress of mind, every former com∣fort, at that moment, goes for nothing. Life is be∣held in all its gloom. A dark cloud seems to hang over it; and it is reviled, as no other than a scene of wretchedness and sorrow. But this is to be unjust to human life, as well as ungrateful to its author. —Let me only desire you to think how many days,
<PB N="184" REF="028306_0189_0FD87F8545488DE8"/>how many months, how many years, you have pass∣ed in health, and ease, and comfort; how many plea∣surable feelings you have had; how many friends you have enjoyed; how many blessings, in short, of diff∣erent kinds you have tasted; and you will be forced to acknowledge, that more materials of thanksgiving present themselves than of lamentation and complaint. —These blessings, you will say, are past. But though past, ought they to be gone from your remembrance? Do they merit no place, in the comparative estimate of the goods and evils of your state? Did you, could you expect, that in this mutable world, any tempo∣ral joy was to last for ever? Has gratitude no influence to form your minds to a calm acquiescence in your Benefactor's appointments? What can be more rea∣sonable than to say. <Q>Having in former times received so many good things from the hand of God, shall I not now, without murmuring, receive the few evils which it pleases him to send?</Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, not only the goods of life are upon the whole greater than its evils; but the evils which we suffer are seldom, or never, without some mixture of good. As there is no condition on earth of pure unmixed felicity, so there is none so miser∣able, as to be destitute of every comfort. Entire and complete misery, if ever it take place, is of our own procuring, not of God's sending. None but the most gross and atrocious sinners can be in such a situation, as to discover no ray of relief or hope. In the ordi∣nary distresses of life, it is generally our own folly and and infirmity which, upon the loss of some one blessing that we had highly prized, deprives us of satisfaction in all other things. Many of our ca∣lamities are purely imaginary, and self-created; ari∣sing from rivalship or competition with others, and from false opinions of the importance of objects, to
<PB N="185" REF="028306_0190_0FD895B9B984CAE0"/>which custom and fashion have annexed and idle val∣ue. Where these mistaken opinions once corrected by reason, the evil would disappear, and content∣ment would resume its place. With respect to those calamities which are inflicted by God, his providence has made this wise and merciful constitution, that af∣ter the first shock, the burden by degrees is lightened. Time brings a gentle and powerful opiate to all mis∣fortunes. What is very violent cannot last long; and what lasts long we become accustomed to bear. Ev∣ery situation that is permanent, at length is felt to be tolerable. The mind accomodates itself to it; and by degrees regains its usual tranquillity. Hence the greatest part of the evils of life are more terrible in the previous apprehension, than in the actual feeling; and it seldom happens but in one corner or other, something is found on which the mind can lay hold for its relief.</P>
<P>How many, for instance, do we behold around us, straightened in their worldy circumstances, and yet finding the means to live cheerfully, with poverty and peace in the same habitation? If we are deprived of friends whom we tenderly loved, are there not still some remaining, from whom we may expect much comfort? If our bodies are afflicted with sore disease, have we not reason to be thankful that our mind con∣tinues vigorous and entire; that we are in a situation to look around us for whatever can afford us ease; and that after the decay of this frail and mouldering tab∣ernacle, we can look forward to a <HI>house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens?</HI>—In the midst of all distresses, there remains to every sincere Christian, that mixture of pure and genuine consolation, which springs from the promises and hopes of the gospel. Consider, I beseech you, what a singularly happy dis∣tinction this makes in your situation, beyond the state
<PB N="186" REF="028306_0191_0FD895BB48F5D6A8"/>of those who, under the various troubles of life, are left <HI>without hope, and without God in the world;</HI> with∣out any thing to look t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but a train of unknown causes and accidents, in which they see no light nor comfort.—Thank the Father of mercies, that in∣to all the evils he sends, he infuses this joyful hope, that <HI>the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed</HI> in the end, to the virtuous and good.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fifth</HI> and last place, as the evils which we suffer are thus eleviated by a mixture of good; so we have reason to believe, that the evils themselves are, in many respects, good. When borne with patience and dignity, they improve and enoble our character. They bring into exercise several of the manly and he∣roic virtues; and by the constancy and fidelity with which we support our trials on earth, prepare us for the highest rewards in heaven.—It has always been found that the present constitution of human nature cannot bear uninterrupted prosperity, without being corrupted by it. The poisonous weed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which spring up in that too luxuriant soil, require the hand of ad∣versity to extirpate them. It is the experience of sor∣row and distress that subdues the arrogance of pride cames the violence of passion, softens the hardness of the selfish heart, and humanizes the temper to feel for the woes of others. Many have had reason to say, that <HI>it was good for them to be afflicted.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isalm cxix. 71.</NOTE> <HI>When men take the timbr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ,</HI> they are apt to <HI>say unto God, De∣part from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the Almighty that we should serve him? But when they are holden in cords of affliction, then he shew∣eth them their work, and their transgressions that
<PB N="187" REF="028306_0192_0FD895BDD0423758"/>they have exceeded. He openeth also their ear to dis∣cipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxi. 12. xxxvi. 8.</NOTE> Is his case to be deplored as highly calamitous, who, by forfeiting some transient enjoyments of the world, purchases lasting improvement in piety and virtue, and exchanges a few of the good things of this life for the better things of another?</P>
<P>Influenced by such considerations as these, let us look up with reverence to the great D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>poser of e∣vents; and under any distress with which he is pleased to visit us, let us utter no other voice but this; <HI>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not re∣ceive evil?</HI>—Men are too often ingenious in making themselves miserable, by aggravating to their own fancy, beyond bounds, all the evils which they en∣dure. They compare themselves with none but those whom they imagine to be more happy; and complain that upon them alone has fallen the whole load of hu∣man sorrows. Would they look with a more impar∣tial eye on the world, they would see themselves sur∣rounded with sufferers; and find that they are only drinking out of that mixed cup, which Providence has prepared for all— <Q>I will restore your daugh∣ter again to life,</Q> said the Eastern sage, to a prince who grieved immoderately for the loss of a beloved child, <Q>provided, you are able to engrave on her tomb the names of three persons who have never mourned.</Q> The prince made inqui∣ry after such persons; but found the inquiry vain, and was silent.—To every reasonable person who retains the belief of religious principles, many alle∣viating circumstances, and many arguments for pati∣ence, will occur under every distress. If we rest on this firm persuasion. That there is a wise and just Providence which disposes of all events, we shall have
<PB N="188" REF="028306_0193_0FD895BF00F06EC8"/>reason to conclude, that nothing happens to us here without some good design. Trusting that a happy termination shall at last arrive to the disorders of our present state, we shall be enabled, amidst all the va∣rieties of fortune, to preserve that equanimity which befits Christians; and under every trial to say. <HI>It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth good in his sight!</HI></P>

<P>Thine own friend, and thy father's friend; forsake not.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHATEVER relates to the behaviour of men in their social character, is of great im∣portance in religion. The duties which spring from that character, form many branches of the great law of charity, which is the favourite precept of Christian∣ity. They, therefore, who would separate such du∣ties from a religious spirit, or who at most treat them as only the inferior parts of it, do a real injury to re∣ligion. They are mistaken friends of piety, who, under the notion of exalting it, place it in a sort of insulated corner, disjoined from the ordinary affairs of the world, and the connections of men with one another. On the contrary, true piety influences them all. It acts as a vivifying spirit, which ani∣mates
<PB N="189" REF="028306_0194_0FD895C07A5D96E0"/>and enlivens, which rectifies and conducts them. It is no less friendly to men than zealous for the ho∣nour of God; and by the generous affections which it nourishes, and the beneficent influence which it exerts on the whole of conduct, is fully vindicated from every reproach which the infidel would throw upon it.—In this view, I am now to discourse on the nature and duties of virtuous friendship, as close∣ly connected with the true spirit of religion. It is a subject which the inspired philosopher, who is the author of this book of proverbs, has thought worthy of his repeated notice; and in many passages has be∣stowed the highest elogiums on friendship among good men. <HI>As ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. Make sure of thy friend; for faithful are the wounds of a friend. A friend loveth at all times; and a brother is born for adversity. There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother,—Thine own friend, and thy father's friend,</HI> it is said in the text, <HI>forsake not.</HI></P>
<P>I must begin the subject, by observing, that there are among mankind friendships of different kinds, or, at least, connections which assume that name. When they are no more than confederacies of bad men, they ought to be called conspiracies, rather than friend∣ships. Some bond of common interest, some league against the innocent and unsuspecting, may have uni∣ted them for a time. But they are held together only by a rope of sand. At bottom they are all rivals, and hostile to one annother. Their friendship can subsist no longer than interest cements them. Every one looks with a jealous eye on his supposed friend; and watches the first opportunity to desert, or to be∣tray.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="028306_0195_0FD87F7DDE447960"/>
Friendships too there are of a different kind, and of a more respectable nature, formed by the connection of political parties. It is not, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haps, on selfish or crooked designs that such friendships are originally founded. Men have been associa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed together by some public interest, or general cause, or for defence a∣gainst some real or imagined danger; and connecti∣ons thus formed, often draw men into close union, and inspire for a season no small degree of cordial at∣tachment. When upon just and honourable princi∣ples this union is founded, it has proved, on vari∣ous occasions, favourable to the cause of liberty and good order among mankind. At the same time, no∣thing is more ready to be abused than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name of public spirit, and a public cause. It is a name, un∣der which private interest is often sheltered, and sel∣fish designs are carried on. The unwary allured by a specious appearance; and the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of faction usurps the place of the generous warmth of friendship.</P>
<P>It is not of such friendships, whether of the lauda∣ble or the suspicious kind, that I am now to dis∣course; but of private friendships, which grow nei∣ther out of interested designs, nor party zeal; but which flow from that similarity of dispositions, that corresponding harmony of minds, which endears some person to our heart, and make us take as much part in his circumstances, fortunes, and fate, as if they were our own. <HI>The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel xviii. 1.</NOTE> Such friendships certainly are not unreal; and for the honour of human nature, it is to be hoped are not altogether unfrequent among mankind.— Happy it is, when they take root in our early years; and are engrafted on the ingenuous sensibility of
<PB N="191" REF="028306_0196_0FD895C43B3C6DC0"/>youth. Friendships then contracted, retain to the last a tenderness and warmth, seldom possessed by friendships that are formed in the riper periods of life. The remembrance of ancient and youthful connecti∣ons melts every human heart; and the dissolution of of them is, perhaps, the most painful feeling to which we are exposed here below.—But at whatever pe∣riod of life friendships are formed, as long as they continue sincere and affectionate, they form, undoubt∣edly, one of the greatest blessings we can enjoy. By the pleasing communication of all our sentiments which they prompt, they are justly said to double our pleasures, and to divide our sorrows. They give a brighter sunshine to the gay incidents of life; and they enlighten the gloom of its darker hours. <HI>A faith∣ful friend,</HI> it is justly and beautifully said, by one of the Apocryphal writers <HI>is the medicine of life.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vi. 16.</NOTE> A variety of occasions happe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when to pour forth the heart to one whom we love and trust, is the chief comfort, perhaps the only relief, we can enjoy. Miserable is he who, shut up within the narrow in∣closure of selfish interest, has no person to whom he can at all times, with full confidence, expand his soul.</P>
<P>Since cordial friendship is so great a blessing to hu∣man life, let us proceed to consider what duties it re∣quires, and by what methods it may be cultivated to most advantage. The fundamental qualities of true friendship are, constancy and fidelity. Without these material <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngredients, it is of no value. An incon∣stant man is not capable of friendship. He may per∣haps have affections which occasionally glow in his heart; which excite fondness for amiable qualities; or connect him with seeming attachment to one
<PB N="192" REF="028306_0197_0FD895C5C0C50968"/>whom he esteems, or to whom he has been obliged. But after these feelings have lasted for a little, either fancied interest alienates him, or some new object at∣tracts him; and he is no longer the same person to those whom he once loved. A man of this inconstant mind cannot be said to have any mind at all. For where there is no fixedness of moral principle, occa∣sional feelings are of no value; mind is of no effect; and with such persons it is never desirable to have any connection. Where constancy is wanting, there can be no fidelity, which is the other basis of friendship. For all friendship supposes entire confidence and trust; supposes the seal of secrecy to be inviolable; supposes promises and engagments to be sacred; and no advan∣tage of our own to be pursued, at the expense of our friend's honour. An inconstant man, is despicable. A faithless man, is bas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</P>
<P>But supposing neither constancy nor fidelity to be altogether wanting, still however friendship is in haz∣ard of suffering from the follies, and unreasonable humours, to which all of us are liable. It is to be regarded as a tender plant in an unfavourable foil, which in order to its flourishing, requires to be re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ed and nursed with care. The following directions may be of use for promoting its cultivation, and pre∣serving it from whatever might be apt to blast and wither it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, let me advise you not to expect perfection in any with whom you contract friendship. It holds in general, with respect to all worldy pur∣suits, that the more moderate our expectations are, they are likely to be the more successful. If, in any situ∣ation of life, we hope to possess complete happiness, we may depend on receiving mortifications. If, in any person, we trust to find nothing but perfection, we may be assured that, on longer acquaintance, we
<PB N="193" REF="028306_0198_0FD895C797EC30F8"/>shall meet with disappointments. In the case of friendship, this admonition is the more necessary to be given, as a certain warmth and enthusiasm belong to it, which are apt to carry us beyond the bounds of nature. In young minds, especially, a disposition of this kind is often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d to take place. They form to themselves rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas, gathered perhaps from fictitious histo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he high and heroic qualities which belong t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nature. All those qualities, they ascribe, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserve or limitation, to the per∣son with whom they wish to enter into intimate friend∣ship; and on the least failure appearing, alienation instantly follows. Hence many a friendship, hastily perhaps contracted, is as hastily dissolved, and disgust succeeds to violent attachment.—Remem∣ber, my friends, that a faithless character on earth is a mere chimera. Many failings you experience in yourselves. Be not surprised, when you discover the like in others, of whom you had formed the highest opinion. The best and most estimable persons are they, in whom the fewest material defects are found; and whose great and soild qualities counterbalance the common infirmities of men. It is to these qualities you are to look in forming friendships; to good sense and prudence, which constitute the basis of every re∣spectable character; to virtue, to good temper, to steadiness of affection; and according to the union of those dispositions, esteem yourselves happy in the friend whom you choose.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, I must admonish you not to be hurt by differences of opinion arising in intercourse with your friends. It is impossible for these not to occur. Perhaps no two persons were ever cast so ex∣actly in the same mould, as to think always in the same manner, on every subject, It was wisely contrived by Providence, that diversity of sentiment should take
<PB N="194" REF="028306_0199_0FD89628C724EB20"/>place among men, on purpose to exercise our facul∣ties, and to give variety to human life. Perpetual uniformity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought would become monotonous and insipid.—W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en it is with regard to trifles that di∣versity or con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rariety of opinions shows itself, it is childish in the last degree, if this become the ground of estranged affection. When f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> such a cause there arises any breach of friendshi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in weakness is then discovered in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortifyin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. In matters of serious moment, the sentimen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the best and wor∣thiest may vary from those of then friends, according as their lines of life diverge, or as their temper, and habits of thought, present objects under different points of view. But among candid and liberal minds, unity of affection will still be preserved. No man has any title to erect his own opinions into an uni∣versal and infallible stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd: And the more enlarged that any man's mind is, the more readily he will over∣look difference in sentiments, as long as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e is per∣suaded that the mind of his friend is upright, and that he follows the dictates of conscience and integrity.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, It is material to the preservation of friendship, that openness of temper and manners, on both hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, be cultivated. Nothing more cer∣tainly disolves friendship, than jealousy which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s from darkness and concealment. If your situation oblige you to take a different side from your friend, do it openly. Avow your conduct; avow your mo∣tives; as far as honour allows, disclose yourselves frankly; seek no cover from unnecessary and mysteri∣ous secrecy. Mutual confidence is the soul of friend∣ship. As soon as that is destroyed or even im∣paired, it is only a show of friendship that re∣mains. What was once cordial intimacy, de∣generates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st into formal civility. Constraint on both sides next succeeds; and disgust or hatred soon
<PB N="195" REF="028306_0200_0FD87FA94747FBB0"/>follow.—The maxim that has been laid down by cer∣tain crooked politicians, to behave to a friend with the same guarded caution as we would do to an enemy, because it is possible that he may one day become such, discovers a mind which never was made for the en∣joyments of friendship. It is a maxim which, not unreasonably I admit, may find place in those politi∣cal, and party friendships, of which I before spoke, where personal advancement is always in view. But it, is altogether inconsistent with the spirit of those friendships, which are formed, and understood to be nourished, by the heart.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> advice which I give is, To cultivate, in all intercourse among friends, gentle and obliging manners. It is a common error to suppose, that familiar intimacy supersedes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttention to the lesser du∣ties of behaviour; and that under the notion of free∣dom, it may excuse a careless, or even a rough, de∣meanour. On the contrary, an intimate connection can only be kept up, by a constant with to be pleas∣ing and agreeable. The nearer and closer that men are brought together, the more frequent that the points of contact between them become, there is the great∣er necessity for the surface b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing smooth, and every thing being removed that can grate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offend.—Let no harsh∣ness, no appearance of neglect, no supercilious a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cta∣tion of superiority, occur in the intercourse of friends. A tart reply, a proneness to rebuke, a captions and con∣tradictions spirit, are often known to embitter domestic life, and to set friends at variance. In those smaller articles of behaviour, where men are too apt to be careless, and to indulge their humour without restraint, the real character is often understood to break forth, and shew itself. It is by no means enough, that, in all matters of serious interest, we think ourselves rea∣dy to prove the sincerity of our friendship. The
<PB N="196" REF="028306_0201_0FD87FAAC53FE710"/>ordinary tenor of life is composed of small duties and offices, which men have occasion daily to perform; and it is only by rendering daily behaviour agreeable that we can long preserve the comforts of friendship.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fifth</HI> place, let me caution you not to listen rashly to evil reports against your friends. When up∣on proper grounds you have formed a connection, be flow of believing any thing against the friend whom you have chosen. Remember, that there is among mankind a spirit of malignity, which too often takes pleasure in disturbing the society of those who appear to enjoy one another. The scripture hath warned us, that there is <HI>a whisperer who separateth chief friends; there is a false witness who soweth discord among brethren.</HI> Give not therefore a ready ear to the officious insinu∣ations of those who, under the guise of friendly con∣cern, come to admonish you, that you ought to stand on your guard against those whom they see you dis∣posed to trust. Consider, whether, under this fair appearance, there may not lurk some secret envy and rivalry, or some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ncealed interest. Chase not every flying report. Suffer not the poison of jeal∣ousy easily to taint your mind, and break your peace. A wide difference there is between that weak credu∣lity which allows itself to be imposed upon blindly, and that dark and suspicious spirit which is always inclined to the evil side. It forms part of the char∣acter of a wise and good man, that he is not prone to <HI>take up a reproach against his neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>sixth</HI> and last place, let me exhort you not to desert your friend in danger or distress. Too many there are in the world, whose attachment to those they call their friends is confined to the day of their prosperity. As long as that continues, they are, or appear to be, affectionate and cordial. But as soon as their friend is under a cloud, they begin to with∣draw,
<PB N="197" REF="028306_0202_0FD87FAD9C314130"/>and to separate their interests from his. In friendships of this sort, the heart, assuredly, has ne∣ver had much concern. For the great test of true friendship, is constancy in the hour of danger, adhe∣rence in the season of distress.—When your friend is calumniated, then is the time, openly and boldly to espouse his cause. When his situation is changed, or his fortunes are falling, then is the time of afford∣ing prompt and zealous aid. When sickness or in∣firmity occasion him to be neglected by others, that is the opportunity which every real friend will seize of redoubling all the affectionate attentions which love suggests, These are the important duties, the sacred c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aims of friendship, which religion and vir∣tue enforce on every worthy mind.—To show your∣selves warm, after this manner, in the cause of your friend commands esteem, even from those who have personal interests in opposing him. This honourable zeal of friendship, has, in every age, attracted the ve∣neration of mankind. It has consecrated to the latest posterity the names of those who have given up their fortunes, and have even exposed their lives, in behalf of the friends whom they haved; while ignominy and disgrace have ever been the portion of them, who de∣serted their friends in the evil day. <HI>Thine own friend forsake not.</HI></P>
<P>Before concluding, it must not be forgotten, that the inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion of the Wise Man in the text, is accom∣panied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith this remarkable expression; not only <HI>thine own friend,</HI> but also, <HI>thy father's friend forsake not.</HI> These words bring back to our remembrance the days of former years; and suggest a sentiment, which cannot but touch every feeling heart. Thine own friend may be dear; thy father's friend ought to be sacred. As long as life remains in any human breast, the memory of those ancient ties should remain,
<PB N="198" REF="028306_0203_0FD87FAE85385978"/>which connected us once with our father, and our fa∣ther's house.—Thy father has perhaps, long ago, gone down to the dust. But when you recal the in∣nocent days of childhood and youth; when you think of those family transactions which once gladdened your hearts; your father's friend in the midst of these will rise to your remembrance. There was a time when you accosted him with respect, or looked up to him with fondness, and was made happy by his kind∣ly notice. Does such a one now survive, and shall he not receive from you some portion of filial rever∣ence and honour? To disregard and neglect him, is to spurn your father's memory; is to insult the ash∣es of him who now sleeps in the grave; is to trans∣mit yourselves to those who shall succeed you, as un∣feeling and base. <HI>Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</HI></P>
<P>I have pointed out some of the chief duties which belong to virtuous friendship; and some of the prin∣cipal means by which this sacred bond should be pre∣served unbroken; this holy flame should be kept a∣live in the human breast. The spirit, and sentiments, which I have studied to inspire, are such as virtue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>athes, and such as true piety should increase. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us we fulfil that great law of love, which our di∣vine Master taught. It is thus we prepare ourselves for those happy regions, where <HI>charity never faileth;</HI> where, in the presence of the God of love, eternal and invariable friendships unite together all the bles∣sed; friendships, which, by no human infirmity dis∣turbed, by death never separated. shall constitute throughout endless ages, a great and distinguished portion of the celestial felicity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM these words I purpose to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>urse of the proper conduct which we ought to ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with re∣gard to futurity, amidst the present uncertainties of use. Time and life are always going on, and to each of us are preparing changes in our state. What these may be, whether for the better or for the worse, we cannot tell; as it hath pleased the wisdom of Provi∣dence, to cover futurity with a veil which no mortal can lift up. In the mean time, none of us can avoid forming designs, and laying plans, for the time to come. The present-moment is never sufficient to give full employment to the active mind of man, with∣out some excursions into futurity; and in these ex∣cursions, the present is often wholly spent. It is therefore of the highest consequence, that a proper direction be given to the mind, in its employments of thought relating to futurity. Otherwise, in the prospects which we take of that unknown region, false hopes, or ill-grounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars, shall slatter or tor∣ment us in vain. <HI>We know not,</HI> as the Wise Man
<PB N="200" REF="028306_0205_0FD8801027F03E40"/>Yells, <HI>what a day may bring forth.</HI> It may, very probably, produce something that we had not looked for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and therefore, instead of <HI>boasting ourselves of to∣morrow,</HI> as the multitude are apt to do, it becomes us to be disciplined and prepared, for whatever it may bring.</P>
<P>It is needless to spend much time in confirming the truth, which is the foundation of the admonition in the text; in proving, either that change and mutabil∣ity belong to our present state, or that the changes of it cannot be foreseen by us. These are truths so obvious and confessed, that an attempt to confirm them is like proving, that all men are to die. At the same time, obvious as they are, it were to be wished, that the thoughts of men dwelt upon them more. For, by a strange but prevailing deception, it would seem, from the general conduct of mankind, that almost every one thinks his own case an excep∣tion from the general law; and that he may build plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with as much confidence on his present situati∣on, as if some assurance had been given him that it were never to change. Hence it has been often ob∣served by serious persons, that there is no more gen∣eral cause to which the vices of men can be ascribed, their forgetfulness of God, and their neglect of duty, than to their presuming upon the continuance of life, of pleasure, and prosperity.</P>
<P>Look but a little way, my friends, into your own state; and you must unavoidably perceive that, from the beginning, it has been so contrived by Providence, that there should be no permanent stability to man's condition on earth. The seeds of alteration are every where sown. In your health, life, possessions, con∣nections, pleasures, there are causes of decay imper∣ceptibly working; secretly undermining the founda∣tions of what appears to you the most stable; contin∣ally
<PB N="201" REF="028306_0206_0FD88010F961FCB8"/>tending, to abolish the present form of things, and to bring forward new appearances, and new objects in their order: So that nothing is or can be, station∣ary on earth. All changes, and passes. It is a stream which is ever flowing; a wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is ever turn∣ing round. When you behold the tree covered with blossoms in the spring, or loaded with fruit in the au∣tumn, as well may you imagin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that those blossoms or that fruit, are to remain in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> place through the whole year, as believe that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>an affairs are to continue, for to-day and to-morrow for this year and the next, proceeding in the same t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or.—To render this r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>flection still more serious, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, I pray you, on what small and inconsiderable causes those changes depend, which affect the fortunes of men, through∣out their whole lives. How soon is e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> done! There needs no great bustle or stir, no long reparation of events, to overturn what seems most secure, and to blast what appears most flourishing. A gale of wind rises on the ocean; and the vessel which carried our friends, or out fortunes, is overwhelmed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the deep. A spark of a candle falls by night in som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neglected corner; and the whole substance of families is con∣sumed in flames before the morning. A casual blow or a sudden fall, deranges some of our inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> parts; and the rest of life is distress and misery. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> awful to think, at the mercy of how many seeming contin∣gencies we perpetually lie, for what we c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> happiness in this world.</P>
<P>In the midst, however, of all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pparent con∣tingencies, plans and designs for the future are every day formed? pursuits are undertaken; and life pro∣ceeds in its usual train. Fit and proper it is, that life should thus proceed. For the uncertainty of to-mor∣row was never designed by Providence, to deter us from acting or planting to day; but only to admon∣ish
<PB N="202" REF="028306_0207_0FD88014216E78C0"/>us, that we ought to plan, and to act, soberly and wisely.—What that wise and sober conduct is which becomes us, what the rules and precautions are, which, in such a state as ours, respect futurity. I now proceed to show. They may be comprehend∣ed in the following directions. Boast not thyself of to-morrow; Despair not of to-morrow; Delay not till to-morrow what is proper to be done to day; Prepare thyself for whatever to-morrow may bring forth; Build thy hopes of happiness on something more solid and lasting than what either to-day or to∣morrow will produce.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the words of the text, <HI>Boast not thyself of to∣morrow;</HI> that is, never presume arrogantly on futuri∣ty; in the most fair and promising state of fortune, beware of pride and vanity; beware of resting wholly upon yourselves, and forgetting Him who directs the changes of this mutable state. If there be any vir∣tues, which the uncertain condition of the world in¦culcated on man, they are, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>lly, moderation and humility. Man was, for this end, placed in a wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> where he knows so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of what is before him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he might be impressed with a sense of his depende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the Ruler of the world; that he might feel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦portance of acquiring favour and protection from Hea∣ven. by a life of piety and virtue; and that, not know¦ing how soon his own condition may be the same wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that of the most wretched, he might be prompted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> act towards all his brethren the humane and frien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The favours which Providence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stowe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him at p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent, he ought to receive with thankful nes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and may enjoy with cheerfulness. Though command∣ed not to <HI>boost himself of to-morrow,</HI> the meaning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the precept is not, that he must be sad to day.

<P><PB N="203" REF="028306_0208_0FD880161B444538"/>
As for them who, intoxicated with those pleasures, become giddy and insolent; who flattered by the illu∣sions of prosperity, make light of every serious ad∣monition which the changes of the world give them, what can I say too strong to alarm them of their dan∣ger?—They have said to themselves, <HI>My mountain stands strong, and shall never be moved. To-morrow shall be as this day, and more abundantly. I shall never see adversity.</HI>—Rash and wretched men! are you sen∣sible how impious such words are? To the world, perhaps you dare not utter them; but they speak the secret language of your hearts. Know, you are usurping upon Providence; you are setting Heaven at defiance; you are not only preparing sharper stings for yourselves, when the changes of life shall come, but you are accelerating those changes; you are fast bringing ruin upon your own heads. For God will not suffer pride in man; and the experience of all ages hath shown, how careful he is to check it. In a thou∣sand memorable instances, the course of his govern∣ment has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sibly pointed against it. <HI>He sheweth strength with his arm, and scattereth the proud in the im∣aginations of their hearts.

<P N="2">II. As we are not to boast, so neither are we to de∣spair, of to-morrow. The former admonition was directed to those whom prosperity had elated with vain hopes. This is designed for those whom a more ad∣verse situation in life has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uled with fears and alarms or what is to come. The reason of both admonitions

It may bring forth some unforeseen relief; and therefore thou shouldest hope under distress.—It is too com∣mon with mankind, to be totally engrossed, and over∣come by present events. Their present condition, whatever it is, they are apt to imagine, will never change; and hence by prosperity they are lifted up. and by adversity are dejected and broken; prone, in the one case, to forget God, in the other, to repine against him. Whereas, the doctrine, which the chan∣ges of the world perpetually inculcate is, that no state of external things should appear so important, or should so affect and agitate our spirits, as to deprive us of a calm, an equal, and a steady mind. Man knoweth neither the good, nor the evil which is be∣fore him. In your <HI>patience, therefore, possess your souls:</HI> trusting, in the day of sorrow that God hath not <HI>for∣gotten to be gracious;</HI> and that <HI>though weeping way endure for a night, joy cometh</HI> to the upright <HI>in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing.</HI></P>
<P>Distress not yourselves, then. with anxious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears about to-morrow. Let me exhort you to dismiss all solicitude, which goes beyond the bounds of prudent precaution. Anxiety, when it seizes the heart is a dan∣gerous disease, productive both of much sin and much misery. It acts a corrosive of the mind. It eats out our present enjoyments, and substitutes, in their pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. many an acute pain.—The Wise Man, in the text, has advised us <HI>not to boast of to-morrow;</HI> and our Saviour has instructed us to <HI>take no thought for to-morrow.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 33.</NOTE> Both these directions. properly understood, are entirly consistent; and the great rule of conduct, respecting futurity, is compounded of them both; requiring
<PB N="205" REF="028306_0210_0FD88018D93D1EE0"/>us, neither arrogantly to presume on to-morrow, nor to be anxiously, and fearfully solicitous about it. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>w,</HI> says our Saviour <HI>shall take thought for the things of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>elf.</HI> We shall be better able to judge of the course mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> proper for us to hold, when events have begun to come forward in their order. Their pre∣sence often suggests wiser counsels, and more success∣ful expedients, than it is possible for us to contrive at a distance. By excess of solicitude before hand, we frequently introduce that consussion of mind, and that hurry and disorder of spirits, which bring us into the most unfavourable state for judging soundly.—Wherefore, never indulge either anxiety, or des∣pair, about futurity. Affright not yourselves with imaginary terrors. Anticipate not evils, which per∣haps may never come. Make the best which you can of this day, in the fear of God, and in the practice of your duty; and, having done so, leave to-morrow to itself. <HI>Sufficient for the day,</HI> when it comes, <HI>will be the evil thereof.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Delay not till to-morrow any thing which is fit and proper to be done to-day. Remember, that thou art not the lord of to-morrow. Thou art so far from having any title to dispose of it, that thou art ignorant of the most material circumstances relating to it; not only of what it shall bring forth, but whe∣ther thou shalt live to see it.—Notwithstanding the uncontrovertible evidence of this truth, procrastinati∣on has, throughout every age, been the ruin of man∣kind. Dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing amidst endless projects of what they are hereafter to do, they cannot so properly be said to live, as to be always about to live; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uture has ever been the gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in which the present is swal∣lowed up and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.—Hence arise many of those mis∣fortunes which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l, men in their worldly concerns. What might at present be arranged in their circum∣stances
<PB N="206" REF="028306_0211_0FD8801A49C480E8"/>with advantage, being delayed to another op∣portunity, cannot be arranged at all. To-morrow being loaded with the concerns of to day, in addition to its own, is clogged, and embarrassed. Affairs, which had been pollponed, multiply and crowd upon one another; till, at last, they prove so intricate and perplexed, and the pressure of business becomes so great, that nothing is left, but to sink under the bur∣den. Of him, therefore, who indulges this linger∣ing and delaying spirit in worldly matters, it is easy to prognosticate that the ruin is not far off.</P>
<P>Evils of the same kind, arising from the same cause overtake men, in their moral and spiritual interests. There are few, but who are sensible of some things in their character and behaviour, which ought to be corrected, and which at one time or other, they in∣tend to correct; some headstrong passion, which they design to subdue; some bad habit, which they pur∣pose to reform; some dangerous connection, which they are resolved to break off. But the convenient season for these reformations is not yet come. Cer∣tain obstacles are in the way, which they expect by and by to surmount; and therefore they go on in peace for the present, in their usual courses, trusting, at a future day, to begin their designed improvement. In the mean time, the angel of death descends; and in the midst of their distant plans, executes his com∣mission, and carries them away.—Guard against de∣lusions of this kind, which have been fatal to so ma∣ny. —Thou art now in tranquillity, in health, in pes∣session of a calm mind.

<P N="4">IV. To be every day prepared for whatever to-morrow may bring forth. There is a certain prepa∣ration for the vicissitudes of life, in which the multi∣tude are sufficiently busted; providing, as they think, against whatever may happen, by increasing their riches, and strongthening themselves by friends, con∣nections, and worldly honours. But these bulwarks which they erect, are totally insufficient against the dreaded storm. It is to some other quarter we must look for our defence; for when it is the world it self, whose changes we have reason to dread, the world, and the things of it, cannot afford us protection.

This prospect is the great corrective of the present vanity of human life. It gives significancy and im∣portance to its most transitory scenes; and in the midst of its mutability, discovers one fixed point of rest.

<P>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this world, we are placed as companions and assistants to one another. Depending, for most of the comforts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>life, on mutual intercourse and aid, it was necessary, that we should be formed to de∣sire the company, and to take pleasure in the good will of our fellow. But this sociability of man, though essential to his present condition, has, like many other good principles, been unhappily warped from its original purpose; and, in the present state of the world, has proved the cause of much evil. For, as vice has abounded in every age, it hath propagated itself much more easily by the assistance of this social disposition. We naturally mould ourselves on the pat∣tern of prevailing manners; and corruption is com∣municated from one to another. By mutually giving and taking, the example of sinful liberties, licenti∣ousness spreads and grows; each jussisies himself by
<PB N="211" REF="028306_0216_0FD895C8BB5D47E8"/>his neighbour; and the multitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>s strength∣en one another's hands to commit i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. In all ages of the world, custom has had more power than reason. Few take the trouble of inquiring what is the right path; the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt content themselves with following that in which the multitude have gone before them. No exhortation, therefore, is more necessary to be frequently given, and to be seriously enforced, than that which we receive from the text; <HI>Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil.</HI></P>
<P>To acquire a full view of any danger to which we are exposed, is the first measure to be taken, in order to our safety. Let us then begin the subject, with considering how much we are in hazard of being missed into vice by the general manners which we be∣hold around us.—No virtue is more necessary to a Christian, but scarcely is there any more difficult to be put in practice, than that firmness of mind which can enable a man to maintain his principles, and to stand his ground against the torrent of custom, fash∣ion and example. Example has upon all minds a se∣cret and insinuating influence, even when we ourselves are insensible of its operation. We imperceptibly slide into some resemblance of the manners of those with whom we have frequent intercourse. This often shows itself, in the most indifferent things. But the resemblance is still more readily contracted, when there is something within ourselves, leans to the same side which is countenanced by the practice of others. We are always glad to find any apology for indulging our inclinations and passions; and the example of the multitude too readily suggests that apology. Even be∣fore corruption has made great progress in our hearts, sometimes, mere complaisance and good nature in∣cline us to fall in with the ways of others. Some∣times,
<PB N="212" REF="028306_0217_0FD895CA3995F950"/>timidity and false shame prevent our differing from them: Frequently, expectation and interest im∣pel us strongly to comply. How great is the danger we incur, when, in times of prevailing vice, all these principles of imitation and compliance unite togeth∣er against our virtue?</P>
<P>The world is too justly said by scripture, to <HI>lie in wickedness.</HI> It is a school wherein every vice is taught, and too easily learned. Even from our earli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st child∣hood, false sentiments are instilled into our minds. We are bred up in admiration of the external show of life. We are accustomed, as soon as we can un∣derstand any thing, to hear riches and honour spoken of as the chief goods of men, and proposed to us as the objects to which our future pursuits ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be di∣rected. We see the measures of outward respect and deference taken from these alone. Reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion and vir∣tue are recommended to us, in a formal manner, by our teachers and instructors; but all improvements of the mind and heart, are visibly placed by the world, in an inferior rank to the advantages of fortune. Vices, that chance to be fashionable, are treated as slight fail∣ings; and coloured over, in common discourse, with tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t and gentle names which express no condem∣nation. We enter, perhaps, on the world, with good principles, and an aversion to downright vice. But when, as we advance in life, we become initiat∣ed in that mystery of iniquity, which is called, the way of the world; when we meet with deceit and artifice in all ranks of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; when we behold iniqui∣ty authorised b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great names, and often rewarded with success and advancement, our original good impres∣sions too soon decay. The practice of the multitude renders vice familiar to our thoughts; and gradually wears off the abhorrence with which we once beheld it. We begin to think, that what is so very general,
<PB N="213" REF="028306_0218_0FD895CC8E9F8BA8"/>cannot be highly criminal. The malignity of sin ap∣pears diminished, by so many being sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers in the re∣proach; and instead of men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s detracting, as they ought to do, from our good opinion of the men, our attachment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the men oftener reconciles us to the vices of which they are guilty.</P>
<P>The countenance which sin receives from the practice of the multitude, not only removes the re∣straints which are imposed by modesty and shame; but such is the degeneracy of the world, that shame is too often employed against the cause of religion and virtue. The ridicule of the giddy and unthinking bears down the conviction of the sober and modest. Against their own belief, they appear to adopt the no∣tions of the infidel; and against their own choice, they join in the vices of the libertine; that they may not be reproached as persons of a narrow mind, and still enslaved to the prejudices of education. How much reason is there to believe that, merely from this timidity of temper, many, whose principles are on the side of religion and virtue, are nevertheless found <HI>walking in the way of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs, and setting in the chair of the scornful?</HI>—Interest, too often coincides with this weakness of disposition, in tempting such persons to follow the multitude. To fall in with the prevail∣ing taste, to suit themselves to the passions of the great, or to the humours of the low, with whom they chance to be connected, appears the readiest way to rise in the world. Hence they are naturally lead to relinquish the firmness of an upright character, for that supple and versable turn, which accomodates itself to the times, and assumes whatever appearance seems most convenient for interest —Such are the dangers to which we are exposed, in times of corruption, of <HI>fol∣lowing the multitude to do evil;</HI> dangers of which re∣quire our most serious attention and care, in order to
<PB N="214" REF="028306_0219_0FD895CDFAF62590"/>guard ourselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them.—I proceed to lay such considerations before you as may be useful for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, Let us remember that the multi∣tude are very bad guides; are so far from having a ti∣tle to implicit regard, that he who blindly follows them, may be perfumed to err. For prejudice, and passion, are known to sway the crowd. They are struck by the outside of things; they inquire super∣ficially, admire false appearances, and pursue false goods. Their opinions are for the most part hastily formed, and of course are variable, floating, and in∣consistent. In every age, how small is the number of those who are guided by reason, and calm inquiry? How few do we find, who have the wisdom to think and judge for themselves, and have steadiness to fol∣low out their own judgment; Ignorance, and low education, darken the views of the vulgar. Fashion and prejudice, vanity and pleasure, corrupt the senti∣ments of the great. The example of neither, affords any standard of what is right and wise. If the phi∣losopher, when employed in the pursuit of truth, finds it necessary to disregard established prejudices and po∣pular opinion, shall we, in the more important inqui∣ry after the rule of life, submit to such blind guidance as the practice of the many; esteeming whatever they admire, and following wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ever they lead? Be assured, that he who sets up the general opinion as the stand∣ard of truth, or the general practice as the measure of right, is likely, upon such a foundation to build no other superstructure except vice and folly.—If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tice of the multitude be a good pattern for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r opinions surely should be as good a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for our belief. Upon this principle, we must ex∣change Christianity for Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Mahometanism, and the light of the Reformation for the superstitions of
<PB N="215" REF="028306_0220_0FD895CF8CA52EC0"/>Popery; for these latter have ever had, and still have, the numbers and the multitude on their side.—Our Saviour has sufficiently characterised the way of the world, when he describes the <HI>broad road</HI> in which the multitudes go as the <HI>road which leads to destruction;</HI> and the path which leads to happiness, as a <HI>narrow path,</HI> which fewer find. From which it is an easy inference, that to have the multitude on our side, is so far from affording any presumption of our being safe, that it should lead us to suspect that we are hold∣ing the course of danger.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, as the practice of the multitude is no argument of a good practice, so it cannot afford us either justification, or safely, in what is evil.—It affords, us, I say, no justification. Truth and error, virtue and vice, are things of immutable nature. The difference between them is grounded on that basis of eternal reason, which no opinions or customs of men can effect or alter. Whether virtue be esteemed, or not, in the world, this makes it neither more nor less estimable in itself. It carries always a divine author∣ity, which men cannot impair. It shines with an es∣sential lustre, which praise cannot brighten, nor re∣proach tarnish. It has a right to regulate the opinions of men; but by their opinions cannot be controlled. Its nature continues invariably the same, though all the multitude of fools should concur in endeavouring to turn it into ridicule. <HI>Wo unto them,</HI> says the prophet Isaiah, <HI>that call evil, good, and good, evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; bit∣ter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.—Their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; be∣cause they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the holy one of Israel.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah v. 20, 24.</NOTE></P>

As the practice of the multitude furnishes no justifi∣cation to the sinner, so neither does it afford him any safety. Religion is altogether a matter of person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con∣cern. God hath delivered to every man the rule of life; and every man must think and act for himself; because for himself he is to answer. If others be wicked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will be the worse for them; but it will not, on that account, be the better for us, if we shall be evil also. Let vice be ever so prevalent, it is still that <HI>evil thing which the Lord abhorreth;</HI> and, <HI>though hand join in hand,</HI> the wicked shall not escape unpunished. So far is the number of offenders from furnishing any ground of safety, that it calls more loudly for divine justice to interpose. It is as easy for the Almighty arm to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rush a whole guilty society, as to punish a single individ∣ual; and when the disobedient subjects of God coun∣tenance and strengthen one another in licentiousness, by transgressing in troops and bands it becomes high time for his government to exert itself, and let its vengeance forth.—One could scarcely think that any professor of Christian faith would fancy to himself any apology from the way of the world, when he knows that the declared design of his religion was, to distinguish him from the world, which is said to <HI>lie in sin;</HI> and that Christ came to call out for himself <HI>a peculiar people,</HI> whose character it should be, <HI>not to be conformed to the world, but transformed by the renewing of their minds.</HI>—So little, indeed, can the practice of the world either justify or extenuate vice, that it de∣serves our serious consideration,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, whether there be not several cir∣cumstances, which peculiarly aggravate the guilt of those who follow the multitude in evil. Do you not, thereby, strengthen the power of sin, and perpetuate the pernicious influence of bad example? By striking off from the corrupted crowd, you might be eminent∣ly
<PB N="217" REF="028306_0222_0FD895D3397503D0"/>useful. You might animate and recover many, whom weakness and timidity keep under bondage to the customs of the world; whereas, by tamely yield∣ing to the current of vice, you render that current stronger for carrying others along; you add weight and stability to the bad cause; you lend to the multi∣tude all the force of your example, for drawing others after them, to the commission of evil.—While you are thus accessory to the ruin of others, you are, at the same time, stamping your own character with the foulest and deepest impressions of corruption. By sur∣rendering your judgment, and your conscience, to the multitude, you betray the rights, and degrade the hon∣our, of rational nature. Nothing great or worthy can be expected of him, who, instead of considering what is right in itself, and what part it is fittest for one in his station to act, is only considering what the world will think, or say of him; what sort of beha∣viour will pass with the fairest show, and be most cal∣culated to please the many. When a man has thus given up the liberty and independence of his mind, we can no longer reckon upon him in any thing. We cannot tell how far he may be carried in vice. There is too much ground to dread, that he will lie, dissem∣ble, and betray; changing himself, without scruple, into every shape that will find favour among those whom he seeks to gain.—While this servility to the world infers baseness towards men, it involves also the highest imprety towards God. It shows that we yield to the world that reverence and submission, which is only due to the divine law. We treat the government of the Almighty with scorn; as if his precepts deserved to be obeyed, only when they suited the caprice and the follies of the multitude; and were entitied to no regard, as soon as they contradicted the reigning customs and fashions of the world.—While
<PB N="218" REF="028306_0223_0FD895D4C7F97160"/>such conduct carries in it so much wickedness and fol∣ly, let us observe,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that the most excellent and hon∣ourable character which can adorn a man and a Christian, is acquired, by resisting the torrent of vice and adhering to the cause of God and virtue against a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all those, who, in any of the great lines of life, have distinguished themselves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have despised popular prejudices, and departed, in several things, from the common ways of the world. On no occasion is this more requisite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned. In times of prevailing licentiousness, to maintain, unblemished virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a public or a private cause, to stand from by what is fair and just, amidst discourage∣ments and opposition; despising groundless censure and reproach; disdaining all compliance with public manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, when they are vicious and unlawful; and never as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amed of the punctual discharge of every du∣ty towards God and man;—this is what shows true greatness of spirit, and will force approbation even from the degenerate multitude themselves. <Q>This is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their conscience will oblige them to ac∣knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we are unable to bend to mean condesce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. We see it in vain either to flat∣ter or to threaten him; he rests on a principle within, which we cannot shake. To this man you may, on any occasion, safely commit your cause. He is incapable of betraying his trust, or deserting his friend, or denying his faith.</Q> Thus <HI>his righteousness comes forth as the light, and his judge∣ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the noon-day.</HI></P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, accordingly, this steady inflexible virtue, this regard to principle, superior to all custom and
<PB N="219" REF="028306_0224_0FD895D63B118178"/>opinon, which peculiarly marked the characters of those, in any age, who have shone as saints or he∣roes; and has consecrated their memory to all poster∣ity. It was this that obtained to ancient <HI>Enoch</HI> the most singular testimony of honour from heaven. He continued to <HI>walk with God,</HI> when the world aposta∣tised from him. He pleased God, and was beloved of him; so that, living among sinners, he was trans∣lated to heaven without seeing death; <HI>Yea, speedily was he taken a way, lest wickedness should have allered his un∣derstanding, or deceit beguiled his soul.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom of Solomon iv. 11.</NOTE> When Sodom could not furnish ten righteous men to save it, <HI>Lot</HI> remained unspotted amidst the contagion. He lived like an angel among spirits of darkness; and the de∣stroying flame was not permitted to go forth, till the good man was called away by a heavenly messenger from his devoted city. When <HI>all flesh had corrupted their way upon the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> then lived <HI>Noah,</HI> a righteous man, and a preacher of righteousness.

Pro∣vidence conferred the immortal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of being the restorer of a better race, and the father in a new world. Such examples as these, and such honours conferred by God on them who withstood the multitude of evil doers, should often be present to our minds. Let us oppose them to the numbers of low and corrupt examples, which we behold around us; and when we are in hazard of being swayed by such, let us for∣tify our virtue, by thinking of those who, in former times, shone like stars in the midst of surrounding darkness, and are now shining in the kingdom of of heaven, <HI>as the brightness of the firmament, for ever and ever.</HI>—As our honour is thus deeply concerned in
<PB N="220" REF="028306_0225_0FD87FA296DD0318"/>our acting a steadfast and virtuous part, let us also con∣sider,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fifth,</HI> place how little in point of interest, can be gained by the favour of the multitude, and how much will certainly be lost, by following them to do evil. We may, thereby, render ourselves more agreeable to some with whom we are connected; and by artful compliances, may please ourselves with the prospect of promoting our fortune. But those advantages, such as they are, remain doubtful and uncertain. The wind of popular opinion is ever shift∣ing. It will often leave us at a loss what course to steer; and, after all our trouble and anxiety to catch the favourable gale, it may on a sudden forsake us. For the versation of character, the meanness and in∣consistency of e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>act, into which a dependent on the multitude is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, frequently render him, in the end, an object of contempt in those whom he sought to please. But supposing him successful in his views, no worldly advantages, which are purchased by dishon∣ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> means, can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e either solid or lasting. They bring no g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ns satisfaction to a man, who is con∣scious to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving given up his principles to serve the world. As long as he could be satisfied with his own conduct, he might beat up under unde∣served discouragement; but when he becomes despi∣cable in his own eyes, worldly honours lose their lus∣tre.—What can the multitude do for you, after you have followed them in evil? They cannot restore to you the peace of an innocent mind, nor heal the sor∣rows of a wounded spirit, nor shield you from the dis∣pleasure of God. They can do little to support you in the hour of affliction, and nothing to deliver your souls in the day of death. Forsaken and disconsolate, the world, for the most part, casts off its votaries in the end; and when you compute the final amount, it
<PB N="221" REF="028306_0226_0FD895D7B9768A70"/>will prove a very small consolation, that as you have had shares in guilt, you shall have companions also in punishment.</P>
<P>Look forward to the issue of things. The multi∣tude of men possess now, in a great measure, the distribution of praise and censure, of success and dis∣appointment, according to their caprice. But this confused and and promiscuous distribution is not al∣ways to subsist The day cometh, when we all are to appear before a more discerning Judge, and a more impartial tribunal. The day cometh, when our Lord Jesus Christ, shall descend from heaven in all the glory of his Father to unveil every character, and to <HI>render to every man according to his works.</HI> At that day, how shall he lift up his head, who hath been all his life the slave of the world's opinion; who hath moulded his principles, and his practice, sole∣ly to please the multitude; who hath been <HI>ashamed of his Saviour and his words;</HI> and to gain favour with men, hath apostatised from the native sentiments and dictates of his heart?—To say all in one word; there is a contest now between God and the world. These form the opposite sides which divide mankind. Consider well, to which of these you will chuse to adhere. On the one side, lie your allegiance, your honour, and your interest; on the other, lie your guilt and your shame. For the one, conscience and reason, for the other passion, and inclination, plead. On the one hand, are the approbation of God, immortal honour, and divine rewards; on the other, —remember and beware,—are the stings of consci∣ence, endless punishment, and endless infamy.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is of the highest importance to religious conduct, that our minds be filled with suitable conceptions of the attributes of God. They are the foundations of our reverence for him and reverence is the foundation of religion. All the divine perfections are interesting to man. Almighty power, in conjunction with eternity and Omnipresence, naturally inspires solemn awe. Infinite Goodness relieves the mind from that oppression which Power alone would produce; and, from our experi∣ence of present benefits, and our remembrance of the past, creates love, gratitude, and trust. In the mid∣dle between these, stands the contemplation of divine Wisdom, which conjoins impressions of awe with those of comfort; and while it humbles us into pro∣found
<PB N="223" REF="028306_0228_0FD87FA40633A198"/>submission, encourages, at the same time our reliance on that <HI>King eternal, immortal, and invisible,</HI> who is justly stiled in the text, <HI>the only wise God.</HI></P>
<P>Among men, wisdom is a quality entirely differ∣ent from cunning or craft. It always supposes good and fair intention in the person who possesses it; and imports, that laudible ends are pursued by proper and justifiable means. In like manner, wisdom in the Supreme Being cannot be separated from the rectitude of his nature. It is, in him, an exertion of benev∣olence; and imports, that the purposes of justice and goodness are carried on and accomplished, by means the most effectual. To meditate on some of those instances in which this divine wisdom is dis∣played, cannot but be highly favourable to the im∣pressions both of piety, and of virtue.</P>
<P>It is difficult to say, whether the natural, or the moral, world, afford the most conspicuons and strik∣ing displays of the wisdom of God. Not one, nor many discourses, nor indeed the study and labour of a whole life, were, in any degree sufficient to explore them. Of the proofs of wisdom which the natural world affords. I cannot attempt now to discourse. Any illustration of these would lead to discussions of a scientific <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind, which more properly belong to the philosopher; and on which philosophy has often em∣ployed itself, with much utility and honour. I shall only take notice that in proportion as human knowl∣edge hath enlarged its sphere of a research and disco∣very, in the same proportion, hath the wisdom of the Creator struck the minds of all inquirers and observ∣ers, with the highest admiration. All nature is in truth a scene of wonders. In the disposition of the heavenly bodies, and the general arrangement of the system of the universe; in the structure of the earth: in the endless variety of living creatures that fill it;
<PB N="224" REF="028306_0229_0FD895DC46B56C28"/>and in the provision made for them all, to enable them to fulfil the ends of their being, it is not easy to determine, whether power, wisdom, or goodness be most conspicuous. It belongs not only to <HI>the hea∣vens to declare the glory of God, and to the firmament to shew forth his handy-work;</HI> in the smallest and most inconsiderable, as well as in the most illustrious works of God, equal marks appear of profound design and consummate art. It has been justly said, that there is not a vegetable that grows, nor an insect that moves but what is sufficient to confound the atheist, and to afford the candid observer endless materials of de∣vout adoration and praise.</P>
<P>When we turn to the moral world, the field of admiration which opens to us is no less extensive and striking. I can only mention a few instances of that exquisite wisdom which every where meet us.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, let us attend to the constitution of human nature. Though we are taught by revelati∣on, to consider it as now impaired by the fall, yet, as it stands, we behold the traces of a noble structure planned and executed with the highest skill. All the powers and faculties bestowed on man are such, as perfectly suit is condition, and adapt him to the pur∣poses for which he was designed.—Senses were given him, that he might distinguish what is necessary for the preservation and welfare of his body. Now, suppose that any one of those senses, the sight, for in∣stance, or the hearing, or the touch, had been in a con∣siderable degree either more blunt, or more acute, than it is at present, what an unhappy change would this have made upon our state? On the one hand, great∣er imperfections of the organs, would have deprived us of all the comfort and advantage which we now en∣joy from such powers. On the other hand, a great∣er, degree of exquisite sensibility in them, would have
<PB N="225" REF="028306_0230_0FD895DDBA91C640"/>rendered life a burden to us. Our senses, instead of being inlets to knowledge and pleasure, would then have become constant avenues to uneasiness and pain. Their powers therefore, are skilfully adjusted to that measure of strength, which allows them to answer the purposes of health, safety, and comfort; without ei∣ther falling short of this line of usefulness, or improp∣erely, and hurtfully, stretching beyond it.</P>
<P>In the mind, appetites and passions were placed, as the moving powers of the soul, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o impel its activity. But as their impulse required regulation and restraint, reason was, at the same time, conferred as the direc∣ting power.—Of all our passions, self-love, and the desire of self-preservation were, with the utmost pro∣priety, made the strongest, for a reason which the meanest capacity may comprehend. Every man is most immediately committed by P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>widence to his own care and charge. He knows his own situation best; and has more opportunities of promoting his own happiness, than he can have of advancing the happiness of any other person. It was therefore fit and wise, that, by the strongest instinct, he should be prompted to attend to himself.—At the same time, as no man standing alone is sufficient for his own wel∣fare, it was necessary that, by mutual sympathy and social instincts, we should be drawn to give aid to one another. Here it deserves our particular notice that the force of those social instincts is, with admi∣rable propriety, proportioned by Providence to the degree of their usefulness and importance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. X. Vol. ii.</NOTE> Thus that parental affection, which the helpless state of in∣fancy and childhood renders so needful, is made the strongest of them all. Next, come those ties of blood, which prompt mutual kindness among those
<PB N="226" REF="028306_0231_0FD895DF4AF6CEF8"/>who are intimately joined together by brotherhood, and other family connections. To these succeeds that valuable instinct of pity which impels us to assist the distressed, wherever we behold them. To take part with others in there good fortune belongs to man's social nature, and increases the sum of happi∣ness. At the same time, to take part with the prosper∣ous is less necessary than to sympathise with the un∣happy; and therefore the principle which prompts us to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice,</HI> is made not to be so strong, as that which impels us to <HI>weep with them that weep.</HI></P>
<P>But they are not only the laudable and important parts of our disposition, which discover the wisdom of the Author of our frame; even our imperfections and follies, are by him rendered subservient to useful ends.—Amidst those inequalities of condition, for in∣stance, which the state of human life required, where it was necessary that some should be rich, and others poor, that some should be eminent and distinguished, and others obscure and mean, how seasonable is that good opinion which every one entertains of himself; that self-complacency with which he compares him∣self to others; and that fond hope, which is ever pleasing him with the prospect of future pleasures and advantages in life? Without those flattering sensa∣tions, vain as they often are, how totally insupporta∣ble would this world become, to many of its inhabit∣ants? Whereas, by means of them, Providence hath contrived to balance, in a great measure, the inequal∣ities of condition among mankind. It hath contriv∣ed to diffuse pleasurs through all ranks; and to bring the high and the low nearer to a level with each other than might at first be supposed. It hath smoothed the most rugged tracts of human life; and hath gild∣ed with rays of borrowed light its most dreary scenes.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="028306_0232_0FD895E0EE0CCD98"/>
One instance of Divine wisdom, in framing our nature, is so remarkable as to demand particular atten∣tion; that is, the measure according to which God hath dispensed knowledge and ignorance to man. There is nothing of which we are more ready to com∣plain, than of our narrow and confined views of na∣ture, and of Providence, and of all things around us: And yet, upon examination, it will be found, that our views extend, on every side, just as far as they ought; and that, to see and know more than is al∣lowed us, instead of bringing any advantage, would produce certain misery.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. i. and Serm. IX. Vol. iv.</NOTE>—We pry, for instance with impatient curiosity, into future events. Hap∣pily for us, they are veiled and covered up; and one peep behind that veil, were it permitted, would be suf∣ficient to poison the whole comfort of our days, by the anticipation of sorrows to come.—In like man∣ner, we often wish with eagerness to penetrate into the secrets of nature, to look into the invisible world, and to be made acquainted with the whole destiny of man. Our wish is denied; we are environed on all hands with mystery; and that mystery is our happi∣ness. For were those great invisible objects fully dis∣closed, the sight of them would confound and over∣whelm us. It would either totally derange our feeble faculties; or would engross our attention to such a degree, as to lay us aside from the business, and con∣cerns of this world. It would have the same effect, as if we were carried away from the earth, and ming∣led among the inhabitants of some other planet.—The knowledge that is allowed to us, was designed to fit us for acting our part in our present state. At the exact point therefore, where usefulness ends, know∣ledge stops, and ignorance commences. Light shines
<PB N="228" REF="028306_0233_0FD895E245F78EB0"/>upon us, as long as it serves to guide our path; but forsakes us, as soon as it becomes noxious to the eye; and salutary darkness is appointed to close the scene.—Thoughtless and stupid must that man be, who, in all this surniture of the human mind, in this exact adjustment of its several powers to the great purposes of life, discerns not the hand of adorable Wisdom, as well as of infinite Goodness.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, Let us contemplate the same wis∣dom as exhibiting itself to us in the moral government of the world. We are informed by revelation, that this life is designed by Providence to be an introductory part of existence to intelligent beings; a state of edu∣cation and discipline, where creatures fallen from their original rank, may gradually recover their rec∣titude and virtue. Under this view, which is in it∣self perfectly consonant to all that reason discovers, we shall find the general course of human affairs, con∣fused as it may sometimes appear, to have been or∣dered with exquisite wisdom.—It was necessary to such a state, that all the active powers should be brought forth into exercise, and completely tried. It became proper, therefore, that there should be a mixture of characters in the world; and that men should be shewn in a variety of situations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. iv.</NOTE> Hence that diversity of tempers and dispositions which are found in society; those inequalities in rank and station, which we see taking place; and those different talents <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, which prompt men to different pur∣suits. By these means, every department in society is filled up? and every man has some sphere prepared for him, in which he can act. He is brought forth as on a busy stage, where opportunity is given for his character to display itself fully.—His life is, with
<PB N="229" REF="028306_0234_0FD895E3BA29E868"/>great propriety, varied by interchanges of prosperity and adversity. Always prosperous he would become, dissipated, indolent, and giddy: Always afflicted, he would be fretful dejected, and sullen. There are sew persons, therefore, or none, whose lot shares not of both these states; in order that every disposition of the heart may be explored, and every mean of improve∣ment afforded.—As man is ultimately designed for a higher state of existence than the present, it was not proper that this world should prove a paradise to him or should afford him that complete satisfaction which he incessantly pursues. Disappointments, therefore, are often made to blast his hopes; and, even while the comforts of life last, they are always mixed with some troubles; in order that an excessive attachment to this world may gradually be loosened. The course of things is evidently so ordered by Providence, that occurrences shall be always happening, to bring down the most prosperous to a level with the rest of his brethren, and to raise up, in their turn, the low and the distressed.</P>
<P>In the midst of those vicissitudes, which are so ob∣viously conducive to improvement, both wisdom and goodness required, that the supreme Governor of the world should be seen to protect the interests, and fa∣vour the side of virtue. But in the degree of evidence, with which this was to be shown, it was no less re∣quisite, that a proper temperament should be observ∣ed. Had virtue been always completely rewarded, and made happy on earth, men would no longer have had a motive for aspiring to a more blessed state. In the case of every crime, had divine justice interposed to bring complete punishment on the head of the crim∣inal; or had all the felicity which is prepared for the just in a future world, and all the misery which there awaits the wicked, been already displayed to the view,
<PB N="230" REF="028306_0235_0FD895E53A5C23C8"/>and rendered sensible to the feelings of men, there would have been an end of that state of trial, for which our whole condition on earth was intended. It was necessary, therefore, that, at present, we should <HI>see through a glass darkly.</HI> A certain degree of mystery and obscurity was, with perfect wisdom, left on the conduct of the Almighty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. i.</NOTE>—But, amidst that obscu∣rity, sufficient encouragement and support is in the mean time given to virtue; sufficient ground is afford∣ed for the full belief, that it is what the Deity loves, and will finally reward. His approbation of it is signified to every man by the voice of conscience. In∣ward satisfaction and peace are made always to belong to it; and general esteem and honour, for the most part, to attend it. On the other hand, the wicked, in no situation of life, are allowed to be truly happy. Their vices and their passions are made to trouble their prosperity; and their punishment to grow out of their crimes. Let any one attentively recollect the material incidents of his life; and he will, for the most part, be able to trace the chief misfortunes which have befallen him, to some guilt he has con∣tracted, or some folly he has committed.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Serm. XIII. Vol. iii.</NOTE> Such is the profound wisdom with which Providence conducts its counsels, that, although is does not appear to in∣terpose, men are made to reap from their actions, the fruits which they had deserved; their iniquities <HI>to correct them, and their backslidings to reprove them;</HI> and while they suffer, they are forced to acknowledge the justice of their punishment.—These are not mat∣ters of rare or occasional observation; but deeply in∣terwoven with the texture of human affairs. They discover a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ular plan, a formed system, according to which the whole train of Providence proceeds;
<PB N="231" REF="028306_0236_0FD895E6CE3F00D0"/>and which manifests to every serious observer the con∣summate wisdom of its Author.—As thus, in the constitution of human nature, and in the moral gov∣ernment of the world, divine wisdom so remarkably appears, I must observe,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, That in the redemption of the world, and in the economy of grace, it shines no less conspicuously. The subject which opens to us here is too extensive to be fully illustrated at present; but the great lines of it are obvious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. V. Vol. i.—Serm. XX. Vol. i.—Serm. XXIII. Vol. ii. Serm. V. Vol. iii.</NOTE>—In carrying on a plan, by which forgiveness was to be dispensed to an offending race, wisdom required that the author∣ity of the legulator should be fully preserved, and no such relaxation be introduced into government as might give license or encouragement to offen∣ders. Accordingly, the most admirable provision was made for these important purposes, by the inter∣position of the Son of God suffering and dying for sinners. The sovereign awe of justice is maintained, while justice is tempered with mercy. Men are bound to righteousness, under the highest sanctions; and am∣ple security and consolation are, at the same time, afforded to the penitent. By the instructions, and example, of their Saviour, they are instructed in their duty; and through a Mediator and Intercessor, they are encouraged to offer their worship and prayers to the Almighty. They are assured that, in whatever is too ardous for human nature to perform, they shall be assisted by a Divine Spirit; and under all trials and difficulties, they are sported by the express promise of that eternal life, which is brought to light by the gospel.—It is not possible for the understanding to con∣ceive any method of salvation, planned with more good∣ness,
<PB N="232" REF="028306_0237_0FD895E839ACCD10"/>and executed with more wisdom, than what is shown in the gospel of Christ. The consideration of this constitution alone, gives us full reason to join in that exclamation of the Apostle: <HI>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this short survey which we have taken of Di∣vine wisdom, as discovering itself, in the whole com∣plex frame of the moral world; in the constitution of human nature; in the government of human af∣fairs; and in the redemption of the human race; we cannot but perceive how much reason we have to pros∣trate ourselves before God, and with all humility to worship and adore.—When we view that immense structure of the universe in which we dwell; when we think of Him, whose wisdom has planned the whole system of being; whose mind comprehends, whose counsels direct, the whole course of events, from the beginning to the end of time; by whom nothing is so inconsiderable as to be overlooked, or so transient as to be forgotten; who attends to the con∣cerns of the poor man in his cottage, while he is steer∣ing the sun and the moon in their course through the heavens; into what astonishment and self-annihila∣tion do we fall! Before him all our boasted knowledge is ignorance, and our wisdom is folly. Wherever we cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eyes on his works and ways, we find all things adju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>number, weight, and measure;</HI> and after all that we can survey, Lo! these are but a part of his ways; and <HI>how small a portion is heard of him!</HI></P>
<P>It is the power of God, which produces among the multitude of men any impressions of religion. When thunder roars in the heavens, or an earthquake shakes the ground, they are struck with awe, and disposed
<PB N="233" REF="028306_0238_0FD895EAA6614970"/>to worship an invisible power. But such impressions of Deity are occasional, and transitory. The lasting reverence of a Supreme Being arises, in a well in∣formed mind, from the display of that infinite wis∣dom which all the universe presents. Its operations are constantly, though silently, going on around us. We may view it in the peaceful and sedate state of the universe, as well as in its greatest commotions; we behold it in every insect that moves on the ground, at the same time that we admire it in the revolutions of the celestial bodies. Happy for us, if the con∣templation shall nourish that temper of habitual de∣votion, which so well becomes dependent beings, and is so intimately connected with all virtue!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. XXVII. Vol. ii.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the chief effect that ought to be produced by meditation on the divine wisdom, is perfect resigna∣tion to the Governor of the universe, and entire trust in his administration. Our private misfortunes and dis∣appointments are too often the subject of queru∣lous complaints, and even of unjust suspicions of Providence. But when in the whole natu∣ral and moral world, we behold an arrangement of things which plainly discovers the most consummate wisdom, can we believe, that in the arrangement of our petty concerns, this wisdom is dormant and ne∣glectful? How much more reason is there to think, that our ignorance of the divine plans misleads our judgment, than that the wisdom of the Almighty has erred in directing our private affairs.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ine wis∣dom, as I observed in the beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> exertion of divine benevolence. It ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it can have, no other scope than to accomplish the best ends, by the most proper means. Let the Wisdom, therefore, and the Goodness, of the deity, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver conjoined in our idea.
<PB N="334" REF="028306_0239_0FD895ED2BE6C500" MS="y"/>Let every new discovery of divine wisdom, be a new ground of hope, of joy, and of cordial submission, to every virtuous man. Let him be thankful that he lives in a world, were nothing happens to him by chance, or at random; but where a great, a wise, and beneficent Mind continually superintends every event.</P>
<P>Under the faith of this great principle of religion, let us proceed in the course of our duty, with stead∣fast and undismayed mind. Let us retain faithful al∣legiance to our Creator and our Redeemer; and then we may always hope the best; and <HI>cast our care upon him who careth for us. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart. Although thou sayest, thou canst not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</HI>—Let us begin ev∣ery undertaking, with humble dependence on his as∣sistance for enabling us to prosecute it to the end. When our undertakings are finished, and the close of life approaches, with praise to him let us conclude all our labours.</P>
<P><HI>Unto the King Eternal, immortal, invisible, the only Wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
