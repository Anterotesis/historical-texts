<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME of the principal debates of the pre∣sent session of Congress, with Remarks there∣on, appeared a few weeks ago, under the Title of, "A Prospect from the Congress-Gallery," publish∣ed by Mr. Thomas Bradford. The favourable re∣ception of that work led me to undertake that which I now offer to the public. My plan, how∣ever, being altered, for reasons with which I am going to acquaint the reader, it became necessary to alter the title also.</P>
<P>No one, who has been an attentive observer of the violent and dangerous attempts, which have been made, and are still making, against the Fede∣ral Constitution, and consequently against the peace, prosperity and happiness of our country, can have failed to perceive, that they had their rise in the de∣ception, which has been so industriously circulated through every part of the United-Sates. It is not to be presumed, indeed, that the leaders in this ho∣stile and formidable combination have been deceiv∣ed: they have long been marshalled and ready for the attack; but, it is the delusion, which has been quietly suffered to steal its way among the people, that has called them into the field and encouraged them to assault, first the out-works, and at last the very citadel of our liberties and our lives.</P>
<P><PB REF="030219_0005_0FE5264C763F40B8"/>The source of this delusion it is not difficult to discover: we have it continually before our eyes. I mean the <HI>public papers,</HI> and I speak with a very few exceptions.</P>
<P>The general government adopted the most effec∣tual measures for facilitating the conveyance of in∣formation to every quarter of the Union, at the least possible expence. Hence subscribers to papers were found in abundance, and the editors, striking off numerous impressions, were, of course, ena∣bled to furnish them at a low price. The intention of the government, as expressed by the President himself, was certainly the most beneficent, that of spreading <HI>true</HI> information and <HI>useful</HI> knowledge among all classes of the community. But what has been the consequence? Exactly the contrary. The French Revolution burst forth like a vulcano, and its devouring lava reached even us. The editors, perceiving the partiality of the most <HI>numerous</HI> class of their subscribers for this revolution, and all the novel and wild principles it has given rise to, have been seduced, by the love of gain, to flatter that partiality by extolling those principles, at the ex∣pence of every thing, their own private interest ex∣cepted. Their papers, which swarm like summer flies, are become the vehicles of falsehood in place of truth, of ignorance in place of knowledge. Like the tenebrificous stars, mentioned by a celebrated author, they shed darkness in place of light.</P>
<P>A veil has been carefully drawn over the dis∣tresses and horrors resulting from the anarchical system of France; or, when this could not be done, when the editors have feared to be anticipated by their fellow-labourers, they have endeavoured to out-vie each other in apologies for what ought to
<PB N="v" REF="030219_0006_0FE5264E01286EB8"/>
have been held up to detestation, or, at least, as an awful lesson to ourselves. Every one, even of the most destructive and impious acts of that pre∣tended republic, has been trumpeted forth as the effect of a liberal and enlightened policy; while no insinuation, no subtilty, no audacious falsehood, has been left unessayed to thwart all the measures of our own mild and wise government, to disfigure its principles, and sever it from the affections of the people.</P>
<P>To countervail the malignant efforts of these retailers has ever been my wish; and, I hope, it will not be thought presumption in me, if I be∣lieve that the trifles from my pen, which the public have honoured with their perusal, have, in some slight degree, had the desired effect. But, alas, what can a straggling pamphlet, necessarily confined to a single subject, do against a hundred thousand volumes of miscellaneous falsehood in folio! Their sheets, if extended, would more than cover the sur∣face of our country.</P>
<P>In opposing a literary monster like this, I am aware that a Porcupine, with all his quills, can ne∣ver hope for complete success: but, nothing can be accomplished without being begun: I hope to call up abler hands to my aid: to me, it will be a suf∣ficient honour to have led the way.</P>
<P>This I shall attempt, in a monthly work, of the same bulk and price as the one which is here sub∣mitted to the public. In this work I shall take a re∣view of the political transactions of the past month; give an account of every democratic trick, whe∣ther of native growth or imported from abroad; unravel the windings of the pretended patriots,
<PB N="vi" REF="030219_0007_0FE5268C04A1F190"/>
and more particularly those of the <HI>flour-merchants;</HI> and I trust, I shall be enabled to give, monthly, a sketch of political affairs more satisfactory, because more correct, than has ever yet appeared in this country. These will be the leading objects; but I shall exclude nothing, not entirely foreign to the nature of the work, that may contribute to the use or amusement of my readers.</P>
<P>The news-papers are supported by subscription, and for that very reason the <HI>Censor</HI> shall not. As long as people read, so long shall I write; and, when the Bookseller advertises me that the work lies on his shelf, it will be a very good hint for me to draw in my quills.</P>
<P>Here, then, begins a <HI>bellum eternum</HI> between the fabricating <HI>Quid-Nuncs</HI> and me.—There is my glove, gentlemen; take it up as soon as you will. You well know that your abuse will infinitely re∣dound to my honour; and therefore, to silence me, by rendering my work sterile and uninteresting, you are reduced to the cruel necessity of telling the truth.</P>
<P>I should think it necessary to offer an apology for having prefixed the title of <HI>Censor</HI> to the pre∣sent Number; but the reader will at once perceive; that it is now assumed for the sake of uniformity, as applicable to the future contents of the work, and not to the remarks on the debates of Con∣gress, a <HI>body</HI> to which I should be very sorry to be wanting in respect.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>POLITICAL</HI> CENSOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will please to recollect, that, in the <HI>Prospect from the Congress Gallery,</HI> I brought down the proceedings in the House of Representa∣tives to the 5th of January, the memorable day of the exhibition of the French Flag. I should not now have thought of returning to the same subject, had I not been led to it by an attack on the Presi∣dent, in the anarchical Aurora of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>One would have thought, that giving this flag a place among the <HI>Archives</HI> of the United States, would have been conferring honour enough on it; but nothing would content the French-Americans, who write in the paper I have just mentioned, short of its being hoisted in the Congress Chamber, as a trophy of the victory of French influence. They cite us the example of the Convention. But, let
<PB N="8" REF="030219_0009_0FE526B71C79E2F0"/>
them say under what circumstances, and with what motive our flag was granted a conspicuous place in their hall. It was dishonoured by being swung up, gibbeted up, by the side of the flag of <HI>regenerated</HI> Geneva; a state in which the Convention had esta∣blished their system of pillage and murder, and which they treated as a conquered country, rather than as an <HI>independent</HI> ally. To add to our humili∣ation, a duplicate, as I may call it, of our flag was sent to Geneva, and there exhibited in the Con∣vention of a poor little degraded nation of thirty thousand bodies, I will not call them souls. This was saying to the Genevese: See, you are not the only people who have thrown themselves on our protecting power, and sent us a pledge of their submission to our principles.</P>
<P>Thus, by the indiscretion (to give it the mildest term) of our Ambassador, have we been degraded in the eyes of even <HI>Italians,</HI> and exposed to the gibes of the little scandalizing circles of the least respectable people in Europe: and, in return for this cruel insult, we are called upon to distinguish the flag of the Convention with a place in the pub∣lic sittings of our legislature, and by this act ac∣knowledge ourselves the supple tools of our in∣sulters!—This is modern patriotism.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="debate">
<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE MINT.
<DATE><HI>January</HI> 19th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P><HI>Mr. Williams,</HI> agreeably to notice before given, mov∣ed <HI>to strike out of the Appropriation Bill all the gross sum, appropriated for the officers of the Mint.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030219_0010_0FE526EA95703478"/>Mr. SEDGWICK (from Massachusetts) thought that the course which the gentleman is pursuing, has never been adopted before. It is incorrect to discuss the merits of the mint in passing this bill. We might as well take up the salary of the chief justice, or any other article in the bill, as the mint. We never would have done at this rate. We are now only to vote for the bill, as agreeably to the laws already made. Mr. Sedgwick said that if the gentleman from New-York (Mr. Williams) would bring forward any proposition for the regulation, or even the abolition of the establishment of the mint, if it could be proved productive of public benefit, he, with every other gentleman, would give him their aid to effect the object; but that now, he conceived, it could not regularly be brought forward. He thought an appropriation bill should be conformed exactly to the state of the public en∣gagements, and that where establishments had been form∣ed and salaries provided, the amount of them should be the principle of calculating the amount of appropriations; and the House ought not, by witholding appropriations, to break in upon and destroy establishments formed by the whole legislature. That these observations had hitherto been sanctioned by the practice on this subject. He ob∣served, that if the House was to investigate, in the dis∣cussion of an appropriation bill, the amount of salaries and the legal establishments of government, the public service would be dangerously destroyed. He remarked, that it was to be observed, that no appropriation was made for any purpose since the commencement of the year.</P>
<P>Mr. GALLATIN (from <HI>Geneva</HI>) rose to state a general principle which he thought it of importance to lay down on this occasion; lest the decision on the present question grounded on a different principle, should on some future occasion be brought forward. The principle was, <HI>that this House has a right by witholding appropiations when they see proper, to stop the wheels of Government.</HI> This he said was plainly to be inferred from the practice of the House, in their passing annually an appropriation law—He ob∣served, that in one instance the House had departed from that principle. In respect to the payment of the interest on the public debt, for the support of the public credit,
<PB N="10" REF="030219_0011_0FE5265944C86938"/>
the House had thought it necessary to give up that right. If this principle is not just, it would be best to make a permanent provision at once.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK said that he had certainly no intention to have given occasion to the observations which had been made, but as the general principle which he had laid down, had been denied, and as it had some relation either intimate or remote to the subject before the committee, he would take the liberty to repeat the principle, and to say a few words in support of it.</P>
<P>The principle, then, which he had assumed was, that when legal establishments were made, it was the duty of the legislature to make appropriations conformably to the public engagements; and that neither branch had a right to withhold its assent.—He observed that the whole legis∣lature, and not a part, were competent to form contracts, and to establish, and alter compensations and salaries. The legislature, and not either branch of it, had the pow∣er of expressing the public will, and pledging the public faith: that when a salary is ascertained, the public faith is pledged that it shall be paid, according to the stipulati∣on; and that therefore the public credit is involved in making the necessary appropriations, without which it could not be paid. He asked if in such case it was com∣petent to the House rightfully to withhold the means ne∣cessary for the performance of the public engagements!</P>
<P>He said he had always supposed that the power of the House, in the case of appropriations, did not give a pow∣er to yield or withhold assent on such a subject. He be∣lieved in every such instance the exercise of discretion was restrained; to illustrate his ideas, he could mention a similar instance. The constitution had declared, that the President should receive a stated compensation for his ser∣vices, to be ascertained by law; which could neither be diminished nor enlarged during the term for which he should have been elected. Here was a duty imposed on the legislature, with the performance of which they could not, they had no power to dispense. Yet after the compensa∣tion was stated, no payment could be made in conse∣quence of appropriating. He asked if in this case, when
<PB N="11" REF="030219_0012_0FE5268A7AAC5AF0"/>
the public will was expressed, the engagement and the national faith pledged, the legislature could of right with∣hold the necessary appropriation? The same observations might he said be applied to every instance where public controuls were formed. The public faith was pledged, the necessary appropriations must be made to prevent a violation of it, and if withheld such violation might justly be charged on the legislature.</P>
<P>Here a long conversation took place with respect to the expediency of the proposed measure, on the ad∣vantages and disadvantages of a Mint, &amp;c. After which Mr. <HI>Livingston,</HI> whom we shall by-and-by see making a considerable figure in the field of opposition to the govern∣ment, made a motion <HI>for the striking out the whole appro∣priation for the Mint.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY, (from Maryland) said that had the gen∣tleman from New-York moved for delay, for the purpose of introducing a motion to repeal the law which rendered this appropriation necessary, he would not have troubled the House with a single remark; but his motion to strike out an appropriation for the purpose of bringing the poli∣cy of the law itself into discussion, contained a principle in his mind so repugnant to the great legislative duties of the House that he would oppose it. The object of the appropriation is not a temporary one, but a part of the machinery of our government, under the express authori∣ty of the constitution by law. The doctrine now contend∣ed for by the gentlemen from New-York and Pennsylvania (Mr. Livingston and Mr. Gallatin) was that this House have a discretionary power of appropriating or not—To this doctrine, taken in the extent which he conceived they contended for, he could not give his support. On the contrary, he thought, that in all cases where an ap∣propriation flowed from a law to make good a contract, or to erect a permanent organ in the government, and from any law whose object was permanent, the true doctrine was, that it was the duty of the House to vote an appropriation. A law is the will of the nation. The same powers only, that formed it can repeal it. If it be a constitutional act, no power can lawfully obstruct its operation or its existence. But attending to the doctrine
<PB N="12" REF="030219_0013_0FE526F5D8F505D8"/>
maintained to day it would follow, that though this House had not the power of repealing a law made by all the branches of government, it may obstruct its operations and render it a dead letter; though it cannot repeal, it may do what shall amount to a repeal, which is the as∣sumption of a power almost equal to that of exclusive le∣gislation. He thought he saw in this an evil of great ex∣tent, and an anarchy of theoretic principles. It appeared to him that though we originate money bills, we had no right to refuse an appropriation to existing laws that either secured a debt or any contract, or that related to objects permanent by the law that created or acknowleged them, as long as the law itself remained unrepealed. We had but a share of legislative power. Where a law relative to such objects as he had alluded to existed, from which an appropriation followed, till the law ceased by repeal or by other constitutional means, it was obligatory upon us as well as upon our constituents, and the only powers we could exercise of a discretionary sort resolved themselves either into the mode of making good the appropriation, or of voting for its repeal. The other branches would then judge of the propriety of our proceeding; but till they who assisted in its enacting, judged with us the necessity of doing it away, a duty resulted that we should give it the energy intended by its enaction.</P>
<P>The Appropriation for the mint was finally passed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The first three items in the Appropriation Bill were as follows:
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL> </CELL>
<CELL><HI>DOL.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>For compensation to the President of the United States</CELL>
<CELL>25,000</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>To the Vice President</CELL>
<CELL>5,000</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>To the Members of the Senate</CELL>
<CELL>38,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>Now, would it not have been much the shortest way for Mr. <HI>Livingston</HI> to move for striking out these three items! This would have been coming to the mark at once. By only three strokes of the
<PB N="13" REF="030219_0014_0FE5272B47DF2300"/>
<HI>"Calm Observer's"</HI> pen, the free, the indepen∣dant, the beneficent government of the United States might have been changed into a National Convention; and in the same number of days, we might have seen our streets patrolled by revolu∣tionary ruffians, our property exposed to requisiti∣ons and our heads to the guillotine.</P>
<P>But, it is not my intention to enter into the me∣rits of a motion, at once the height of malevolence and absurdity; I have introduced this debate mere∣ly to have an opportunity of introducing the prin∣ciple laid down by <HI>Mr. Gallatin,</HI> and <HI>Mr. Galla∣tin</HI> along with it.</P>
<P>This gentleman tells us, that the House of Re∣presentatives <Q><HI>have a right, by withholding appro∣priations</HI> when they see proper, <HI>to</HI> stop the wheels of Government.</Q>—I should be glad to know were he learnt this: whether from his companions in Brad∣dock's Field, or from their correspondents, the corrupted <HI>flour-merchants</HI> in Philadelphia. They, indeed, were well versed in stopping the wheels of government, by the agency of <HI>appropriations.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Gallatin rose from his seat to broach this clogging principle, there was an old farmer sitting beside me, to whom the person of the ora∣tor seemed familiar. "Ah, ah!" says he, <Q>what's little Moses in Congress!</Q>—I sharply reprimand∣ed him for taking one of our Representatives for a Jew; but, to confess a truth, the gentleman from <HI>Geneva</HI> has an accent not unlike that of a wander∣ing Israelite. It is neither Italian German nor French, and, were it not a sort of leze republican∣ism, I would say he clipped the king's English most unmercifully. Such an accent is admirably adapted for extolling the value of leaden buckles,
<PB N="14" REF="030219_0015_0FE5271C6259BF38"/>
or for augmenting the discordant howlings of a sy∣nagogue; but it throws a certain air of ridicule over the debates of a legislative assembly, and forms a sort of burlesque on the harmonious eloquence of the other members.</P>
<P>When I told the good jog-trot to take care what he was saying, for that the personage then on his legs was no other than the great Gallatin, he open∣ed his eyes, and with a look and voice expressive of an honest indignation, "what!" says he, <Q>that same Gallatin who was one of the leaders in the Western Insurrection?</Q>—I could not help smil∣ing at the simplicity of my country friend, in not perceiving that such a circumstance was the highest proof of Mr. Gallatin's patriotism, and the only one that recommended him to the suffrages of his constituents.—"No wonder," says the farmer, <Q>that he wants to stop the wheels of government. I wish he'd attempt to stop the wheels of my waggon, as I am going down hill.</Q>—God for∣give me, but I believe I said <HI>amen.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Gallatin has been accused of inconsistency, but here I cannot join the enemies of that gentle∣man. Whatever a man may be, I love to do him ample justice. This is a principle so strongly im∣printed in my breast, that it induces me to under∣take the defence of Mr. Gallatin's consistency, though I have not the highest respect for his gene∣ral conduct or for his character.</P>
<P>We might follow this gentleman through his political career from the day of his disembarkation to the present session of Congress, but it will not, I imagine, be necessary to go further back than the Western Rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030219_0016_0FE526B8CCA70B50"/>So early as the 21st of July, 1791, we find him Clerk to a meeting for opposing the excise law, or, in other words, <Q>stopping the wheels of go∣vernment.</Q>—On the 21st of April, 1792, we find this adjourned meeting declaring: <Q>That whereas some men may be found among us, so far lost to every sense of virtue, and feeling for the distresses of our country, as to accept the office for the collection of the duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Resolved, therefore, that in future we will consider such persons as unworthy of our friend∣ship, have no intercourse or dealings with them, withdraw from them every assistance, and <HI>with∣hold all the comforts of life,</HI> which depend upon those duties which as men and fellow citizens we owe to each other, and upon all occasions, treat them with that contempt they deserve; and that it be, and it is hereby most earnestly <HI>recommended to the people at large,</HI> to follow the same line of conduct towards them.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, then, I think here is no inconsistency; no change of principles. The man that could draw up a resolution like this, cannot be said to have abandoned his principles, when he declares that the House of Representatives may stop the wheels of government, when they see proper, by withholding appropriations.</P>
<P>It is said, indeed, that Mr. Gallatin has since re∣pented of his insurrection conduct, that he called the above quoted resolution his "political sin," and we all know that he signed a promise of submission to the laws; but, let it be remembered, that he never talked about this political sin, until he came down to Philadelphia, and that his promise of sub∣mission
<PB N="16" REF="030219_0017_0FE4FE534FDF1470"/>
to the laws was not made, until he saw that resistance was in vain, and that it was the only way of availing himself of the amnesty, and saving his carcase from a loathsome dungeon. And, if he did leave his poor deluded adherents in the lurch, and even sacrifice them to his own safety, this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more than every rebellious ringleader is ready to do, when the moment of danger arrive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. It is by no means a proof of inconsistency in the gentleman from Geneva. It is, to use the words of a late political writer, <Q>varying his means <HI>to preserve the</HI> unity of his end.</Q> When overturn∣ing a government, or stopping its wheels, is the sole object of a patriot, so long as he keeps stea∣dily towards the point, whether by open rebellion, confessing his political sin, pretending submission, lurching his associates, or withholding appropriati∣ons, he can never be justly charged with incon∣sistency.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="debate">
<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A STENOGRAPHER.
<DATE>January 29th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>On the 28th a report of the Stenographical committee was given in, specifying that the committee had received proposals from Mr. <HI>David Robertson</HI> of Virginia, whose demand for one sessions was 4,000 dollars. The report became the order of the day for the twenty ninth, when a resolution was proposed in favour of the appointment.</P>
<P>I shall choose from this debate what fell from Mr. Swan∣wick and Mr. William Smith, as appearing to me to comprize nearly all that was urged on both sides.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030219_0018_0FE5269992B1B888"/>Mr. SWANWICK (from Pennsylvania) As to the gentle∣man who is the subject of the resolution, If I have more strenuously than usual opposed the motion, it is from a desire to keep him from quitting the lucrative situation he is said to find himself in, to embark on the stormy sea he is contemplating: to be the organ of the members of this House to their constituents is indeed a very delicate task; one for which, considering the danger he might be in of an Orpheus's fate, that of being torn to pieces, the salary is but a poor compensation. He is to do justice to the eloquence of some members—he is to clothe in an elegant dress the uncouth, yet well meaning expressions of others, but what will he do with the silent members, who never speak at all?—What will their constituents think of them; indeed, Sir, if he had the idea I have formed of his dan∣ger, he will not undertake at all. Faction and party have been mentioned—happy Stenographer if he can keep clear of these. If he fall into their power, insensibly he will represent one side in clouds and darkness, the other as ornamented with the brightest beams of light. How will he please both? Misrepresentation is complained of alas, Sir, how quick is error, how flow is the progress of truth in almost all things: our Stenographer must indeed be a wonder working man, if he can revert this tide, and make every where light, and correct reasoning prevail. The best mode of informing our constituents is by the yeas and nays on our acts; this truly shews, as a gentle∣man from New-Hampshire has observed, our doings, which are much more interesting to them than our ab∣stract reasonings; these our constituents will easily form to themselves ideas of when they know our votes.</P>
<P>Mr. W. LYMAN (Massachusetts) said that, if this resolu∣tion did not pass, <HI>it would be advisable to send all the Prim∣ers to the gallery.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. W. SMITH (South Carolina) said it was admitted on all sides, that it was highly important for the people to receive the most accurate information of the proceed∣ings of the house, and that the debates were in general extremely misrepresented. Was it not then the duty of the house to remedy this evil and to adopt such measures as would transmit to the people in every part of the Unit∣ed States the most accurate information of the conduct of
<PB N="18" REF="030219_0019_0FE5265BD7C1AE28"/>
their representatives? The house had now an opportuni∣ty of obtaining the services of a gentleman peculiarly distin∣guished for the rare talent of reporting with accuracy pub∣lic debates: the compensation which would be adequate to such useful and laborious service was beyond the ability of any printer, the house ought therefore to contribute to∣wards it; the sum required was a trifle when compared with the advantages; it was no object: the only question then was whether the stenographer ought to be an officer of the House; in that capacity he certainly would be more easily restrained from the commission of any wilful misre∣presentation. Mr. Smith did not feel the force of the ob∣jections against the report. It had been said that although the members were now misrepresented, yet they had it in their power to publish corrections; but these corrections were often overlooked, while the misrepresentation was operating very injuriously to the character of the member: this was generally the case in places remote from the seat of government; the mangled account of a debate was re∣published in a distant paper, and the correction if it reach∣ed the distant printer, was generally disregarded. Among the opponents to the report, Mr. Smith said that he was surprised to find the gentleman who represented this city, (Mr. Swanwick) who more than any other member should have withdrawn his opposition to the measure proposed; that gentleman's constituents had it in their power at any time to hear the debates of Congress; they were on the spot; ought he not then in candor to assist in facilitating to the remote citizens the means of obtaining the best knowledge of the proceedings, and the most correct state∣ment of the discussions of the house; ought they, from their remoteness, to be kept in the dark, or to be furnish∣ed with such light as would only mislead? Had they not a claim on the house to adopt such means as would ena∣ble the citizens in every state to judge of the propriety of public measures? The member from this city had ano∣ther exclusive advantage; if misrepresented he could cor∣rect the error, and the correction will be read; that was not the case with the members of remoter states, whose reputation might be injured by misrepresentation without a similar advantage: the member from this city was in the midst of his constituents; he had daily opportunities of setting right any mistatement by personal explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030219_0020_0FE526F9871629C8"/>Mr. SMITH said he did not agree with some Gentlemen that it was sufficient for the people to know what laws were passed, without knowing the previous discussions; he thought on the contrary, the favorable or unfavorable impression of a Law on the public mind would depend in a great degree on the reasons assigned for and against it in debates, and the people ought to know those reasons; when a Law passes, imposing a Tax, would not the peo∣ple be reconciled, if they saw from the discussions of the house that such Tax was unavoidable, and that the par∣ticular mode of taxation was the best which could be de∣vised? And ought this information to depend entirely on the caprice or convenience of the reporters, who at∣tended when it pleased them, and who published just as much of the debates as they found leisure or patience to accomplish? Mr. Smith said, he was convinced that the errors which had excited so much complaint were not the effect of design, but merely of inadequacy to the task; very few were competent to such a business, which requir∣ed peculiar skill in stenography, very laborious application, and a clear comprehension of the subject matter of debate. It could not be expected that persons thus qualified would devote their whole time to this business without an ample reward. The report was objected to because there was novelty in the plan; it was true the House of Com∣mons of England had no such officer, but their practice was not a fit precedent for us on this occasion, for they admitted no person to write down in the house their pro∣ceedings; their debates were taken from memory. This house on the contrary had from its first institution, facili∣tated, by every accommodation, the reporting their pro∣ceedings. The thing was not altogether however without precedent; during the existence of the national assembly of France there were officers of the house who composed a daily work called the Logography, which was an exact account of the debates of that body. It had been asked what controul the house were to have over this officer? he answered that the Stenographer would be liable to be cen∣sured or displaced, if he should be guilty of wilful misre∣presentation; it would be always easy to discriminate be∣tween a casual inadvertence, and a criminal mistatement: the officer's character and talents, his responsibility to the house, and his oath to report with impartiality, would
<PB N="20" REF="030219_0021_0FE4FE54D8CB59E0"/>
be a sufficient pledge of his accuracy. Mr. Smith serious∣ly believed, that the character of the house had suffered from the erroneous statements which had gone abroad; he wished to guard against this evil in future; he was will∣ing, for himself, that every syllable he uttered within those walls, should be carried to every part of the union, but he deprecated misrepresentation. He was anxious that the truth should be known, in relation to every act of the government, for he was as satisfied that the affection and confidence of the people in this government would in∣crease with the promulgation of truth, as that whatever it had lost of that affection and confidence was owing al∣together to the propagation of detraction and calumny. It was under these impressions that he had originally brought forward the proposition, and that he now recom∣mended the report, and having heard no reasons to change his sentiments of the expediency of the measure, he should persist in supporting it.</P>
<P>The committee of the whole was discharged from any further consideration of the subject.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The House had nearly got upon a rock here, which they would have found it difficult to get off from in safety. Perhaps there was never a resolu∣tion proposed, at once so apparently trifling and so pregnant with mischief. Let any man reflect for a moment on the state of parties in this country, and he will look with affright at the appointment of an officer, invested with the power of disfiguring every argument and even every phrase that a member of the legislature may let fall. The gentlemen who supported the resolution, talk of his being sworn; and, did we live in those good old times, when oaths were superior to the spirit of party, the ar∣gument would be unanswerable: but, alas! those times are no more. Oaths on the Evangelists are, in this <HI>enlightened</HI> age, little more than mockery.
<PB N="21" REF="030219_0022_0FE5265DB54511D8"/>
The members of the present Congress have every man of them sworn to maintain the Constitution of the United States, and yet, how many of them do we see at this moment straining every faculty of the mind to render it null and void? what, then could be hoped from a Stenographer.</P>
<P>Were a perfect stranger to listen to a debate he would contract a partiality for one side or the other, before it was half over. Every man in a popular government has his party; and who can suppose that the Stenographer would not have his? It was said that the House had a check upon him, in their power to dismiss him from his office. But, this must be done by a vote of the House, and there∣fore it could be no defence for a member who had the misfortune to find himself in a minority.</P>
<P>Indeed, this power of dismission is one of the worst parts of the plan; for, as the Stenographer would be loath to quit so lucrative an employment, he would of necessity be led to preserve a majority in his favour; and, what would be so sure a way of doing this as misrepresenting the speeches of the minority? a member might complain; but the Stenographer, secure in his majority, would laugh at him. Thus might a man of talents and inte∣grity be officially represented as a fool or a knave, without having the possibility of redress. In vain would he endeavour to justify himself: the sworn Stenographer would be believed before him, and the House, by a solemn decision, would determine that he had said what he never dreamt of.</P>
<P>Should an officer like this ever enter the House, it is easy to forsee that he will not be long wanted. The very sight of such a tremendous umpire
<PB N="22" REF="030219_0023_0FE5269C6D288818"/>
would frighten away all freedom of speech. It is true the members of the majority might prattle away, but those of the other side would naturally look upon themselves in the situation of a man who is making a deposition. One party only would dare to open their mouths. Where there is no op∣position there can be no debate, and, of course no need of a Stenographer.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Smith's</HI> objection to citing the example of the British House of Commons on this occasion did not appear to me well founded. They permit no one to write down their words after them; yet I believe it will be allowed that their debates are very well reported, and this is a pretty good proof that an officer for that purpose is by no means necessary,</P>
<P>This gentleman mentioned the officers of the <HI>Logography</HI> employed by the second National As∣sembly in France. Unfortunate instance! the French Constitution, that <Q>master-piece of legis∣lation,</Q> which was to last as long as the round world, lasted only ten months and ten days; and, among the engines by which it was destroyed, the office of the Logography claims a conspicuous place. There were ten of these reporters. They wrote in the literal character: one took the first sentence, another the second, and so on. Ten men were much more difficult to warp and corrupt than one would be, and yet we ever see them the decided tools of the strongest party. Members complained of misrepresentations, and had the satis∣faction to see their complaints still more disfigured than their speeches. The consequence was, the few real friends of the Constitution were obliged to hold their tongues, and suffer the inflamatory har∣rangues
<PB N="23" REF="030219_0024_0FE52639D28B6BD8"/>
of their opponents to go forth among the people uncontradicted.</P>
<P>I never like to hear the examples of foreign go∣vernments applied to our own, particularly the ex∣amples of what is called the government of France. I was astonished that a gentleman of Mr. Smith's good sense and good intentions should hold up for our imitation, or even mention as an instance, one of the most insidious measures of an Assembly, who were guilty of every crime under heaven; who, after having repeatedly sworn to defend with their lives the inviolability of their sovereign, cooly planned an insurrection to hurl him from his throne, afterwards made this very insurrection the subject of an article of accusation against him, and decreed that their own <HI>perjury was a virtue!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Lyman's</HI> hint for driving all the printers out of the house, <HI>unless the resolution passed,</HI> was a striking instance of the domineering spirit, which would infallibly have overborn any Stenographer who had been unfortunate enough to accept of the post.</P>
<P>This hint broke out, some days after, in the form of a resolution, from the lips of <HI>Mr. Heath</HI> of Virginia.—<Q><HI>Resolved, that, until a Stenogra∣pher be appointed, or further provision made for taking the debates of this House,</HI> no printer be permitted to publish abstracts of the speeches of mem∣bers, unless permitted by members making the same.</Q> This was the substance of the resolution, and a curious one it is.</P>
<P>These gentlemen seem to have been determined to force their harrangues, at full length, down
<PB N="24" REF="030219_0025_0FE526A30B50F130"/>
our throats, or to keep us in a sort of political starvation. We must either swallow them by do∣zens of yards, as buffoons do ribbons, or we must never have a taste.</P>
<P>I wonder where Mr. Lyman learnt a doctrine like this. Such an idea could certainly never be engendered in the free temperate air of Massachu∣setts. As to the gentleman from Virginia I am not surprized; for, we know that, when a sulky negro will not lick up his mess clean, however insipid, disgusting and nauseous it may be, he is muzzled till his stomach comes to. But, are we Pennsylva∣nians to be treated thus?—No, no, Mr. Heath; when you get the government on the other side of the Potomack, you may, and undoubtedly will, do what you please with it; but we have four years to live, at any rate; be not in such haste to muzzle us then.</P>
<P>Should this resolution ever reach the other side of the Atlantic, what idea will it give the English patriots of our liberty of the press? If a mem∣ber of the British House of Commons were to pro∣pose such a tyrannical resolution, I should not wonder to hear of his being stoned to death. Not publish abstracts from speeches without particular permission! The idea was certainly imported from the borders of the <HI>Palus Meotis.</HI></P>
<P>Had these two gentlemen restricted the prohibiti∣on to their <HI>own speeches,</HI> I believe that neither the House nor the public would have cared much about the matter; for neither of them is of the Ci∣ceronian stamp. It is observable, that those who appeared most anxious for the appointment of a Stenographer, if we except one or two, are amongst the few whose speeches can do them no sort of cre∣dit
<PB N="25" REF="030219_0026_0FE526A6954557D0"/>
with any party. This is the way of the world. Animals, whether endued with the faculty of speech or not, seem to fly in the face of nature. The ug∣ly woman is everlastingly at her glass: the owl thought her frightful brood the prettiest little crea∣tures in the world; and the insipid orator, while his voice is drowned in the hemmings, coughings and snorings of his drowsy audience, thinks he is uttering sentences that ought to be written in let∣ters of gold.</P>
<P>It was observed in the course of the debate, that, if the printers committed errors, gentlemen might write out their speeches and send them to the press. To this Mr. Nichols replied, that he was above do∣ing any such thing.—For my part, I must confess, that, were I capable of making a speech, I should be too lazy to write it out for the News-Papers; but as to its being beneath a law-giver, I shall say nothing; for we have an example before our eyes of a folio orator in the House of Assembly of Pennsylvania, who is so far from thinking it be∣neath him to write out his speeches, that he even reads them from his seat, like a school-boy from his bench. I allude here to one <HI>Doctor Morpheus,</HI> who, finding his neighbours determined not to die under his hands, is now endeavouring to assassinate the State. The State, however, seems to partake of the obstinacy of his neighbours, turning a deaf ear to all his prescriptions. The bolus of sedition which he had kneaded up for the Assembly, did, indeed, at first, operate as a provocative on some of the members from Whiskyland; but, luckily, the soporific qualities of it soon became predominant, and, at last, absolutely irresistible. At the end of the second paragraph the Chairman was perceived to yawn, the third rocked him off, and the fourth laid the whole Assembly fast asleep. The fifth
<PB N="26" REF="030219_0027_0FE526BA509CDE60"/>
reached the door-keeper, at the further end of the passage, and before the sixth was half finished, an old woman who fells apples at the gate, dropped from her stool. The political <HI>Morpheus</HI> continued to spread his poppies, till, perceiving the effects of his bolus, he slunk off home to his liver nippy and sour cront.—Should this quack in politicks as well as physick be suffered to continue his lectures, the Assembly of Pennsylvania may write over their doors, as the French do over those of their burying grounds: "This is the place of everlasting sleep."</P>
<P>After this little trip to the Land of Nod, let us return to our Stenographer.</P>
<P>I by no means call in question the virtue of Mr. Robertson, the officer proposed: on the contrary, I should suppose his virtue must be very high; for, like that of Fielding's post-boy, it is very high priced. If it be equal to his modesty, it is certain∣ly beyond any thing reasonably to be expected from a frail mortal. The humble demand of four thou∣sand dollars for the session is not a great deal more than eight times as much as any member of the House receives. The very mention of such a sum cannot fail to bring forth swarms of Stenographers, as a warm night at the play-house is said to hatch comedians.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this article without reminding gentlemen of their cruelty to my poor Caledonian friend, Callender. How was he mauled! how was his <HI>Register</HI> torn to pieces! one took him by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, another by the ear; he writhed and winced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> jumped about, as the French say, like a frog <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a gridiron. I much question if he were in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> torture when the constables of sweet Edin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were at his heels.—Oh! gentlemen from
<PB N="27" REF="030219_0028_0FE5265F3936FCE8"/>
Virginia! how could you so belabour this import∣ed patriot? a man that has not only forsworn his country, but has written, or rather transcribed, two whole "Political Progresses" purely to curry fa∣vour with you! nay, he has even blasphemed the President, and justified the non-payment of debts; and yet, Oh, ingratitude! you could smile at his agonies! if this be the way you treat your friends, I hope I shall never be numbered amongst them; at least until your manners and principles change.</P>
<P>One gentleman expressed a good deal of anxiety, lest the "Political Register" should descend to po∣sterity; but, let him quiet his fears on this ac∣count; for, whether the speeches which Callender has collected were <HI>written out</HI> or not, they are a more potent opiate than any drug that was ever pounded in the mortar of <HI>Doctor Morpheus,</HI> and that is saying a great deal, I am sure.</P>
<P>I now come to a debate, if a debate it can be called, which I would have the reader pass over without perusal, if he has a heart ready to take fire, when he sees a wanton indignity offered to the greatest and most estimable characters.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="debate">
<HEAD>DEBATE ON HALF AN HOUR'S ADJOURN∣MENT.
<DATE>February 22nd.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This was the Birth-Day of <HI>General Washington.</HI> The morning was remarkably fair: the firmament decked in its brightest robes. May it ever be so! Never, never may a cloud darken this auspicious day!</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030219_0029_0FE526BC347F1A28"/>The city was all alive: joy seemed to glisten in every face; the workman had thrown by his ham∣mer and the housewife her needle, to celebrate this festival of valour, wisdom, and true patriotism. I was going, among hundreds of others, to see the cannons of the state fired on this joyful occasion, when, passing by the House where the Representa∣tives meet, I perceived the doors open. I thought I would just step in, and see what they were about, I entered, found the gallery quite empty, and was surprized not to find the house empty also. This surprize soon gave way to indignation, as the rea∣der will readily believe, when he hears what was passing.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Smith</HI> (from South Carolina) moved, that the House adjourn for <HI>half an hour,</HI> in order to give the mem∣bers an opportunity of congratulating the President of the United States on the return of his Birth-Day.</P>
<P>Strange to tell! this motion was opposed. The ground of this opposition was, that it was the duty of the House first to attend to the discharge of their legislative functions, before they attended to the paying of compliments. It was said, on the other hand, that it had been the practice, ever since the establishment of the general government, for the House to make a short adjournment, for the pur∣pose mentioned in the motion.</P>
<P>After some conversation in this way, <HI>Mr. Gal∣latin</HI> (from <HI>Geneva,</HI> last from <HI>Whiskyland</HI>) moved, that the words, <HI>"half an hour,"</HI> be struck out,</P>
<P>This amendment was rejected. The motion was then put, and lost.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Ayes 38</ITEM>
<ITEM>Noes 50</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030219_0030_0FE5273B14D757A8"/>Thus was it determined, by a majority of twelve, to withhold from the President a slight compliment, which he had been accustomed to receive from the House, from the first year of its existence.</P>
<P>I was but too right in saying, that, at the open∣ing of the session, <Q>he saw, even among those to whom he addressed himself, numbers, who, to repay all his labours, all his anxious cares for their welfare, were ready to present him the cup of humiliation filled to the brim.</Q></P>
<P>It was <HI>Mr. Parker,</HI> the <HI>blooming</HI> and <HI>accomplish∣ed</HI> Mr. Parker, the <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> Mr. Parker of the <HI>free</HI> State of Virginia, who is as punctual in the discharge of his legislative functions as his con∣stituents are in the discharge of their debts: it was this celebrated gentleman, who opened the career, by a motion for not waiting on the President with an answer to his speech to both Houses. Mr. Park∣er was, without doubt, persuaded of the truth of Johnson's maxim:
<Q><L>"Fate never wounds more deep the <HI>gen'rous heart,</HI></L>
<L>"Than when a <HI>blockhead's insult</HI> points the dart."</L></Q></P>
<P>The excuse, <Q>that it was the duty of the House first to attend to the discharge of their legislative func∣tions,</Q> was the most miserable subterfuge, that ever issued from the lips of malevolence. <HI>Half an hour</HI> only was asked for. Heavens! How many half hours have been idled away this very session!— The Speaker sends word that he is <HI>indisposed.</HI>—Ad∣journ! Adjourn!—And this is repeated <HI>day after day.</HI> What would have been easier than to appoint a Speaker <HI>pro <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em,</HI> if members were so ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss in
<PB N="30" REF="030219_0031_0FE526E6774283D0"/>
the "discharge of their legislative functions?" Yet, this was not done, nor, I believe, proposed; though some one of these fifty indefatigable mem∣bers were certainly present. How differently do men see the same object, under different circum∣stances! the Speaker's head-ache adjourns the House for whole days. But, <HI>half an hour,</HI> a poor thir∣ty minutes, was too precious to be wasted in a re∣spectful compliment to the best man, perhaps, this day existing in the world!</P>
<P>The gentleman from <HI>Whiskyland</HI> was, without doubt, afraid, that the motion would not be reject∣ed altogether. He imagined the House had not so far got the better of all decency, as to come to an unqualified determination not to wait on the Presi∣dent, he therefore proposed to leave out the words, <HI>"half an hour."</HI> If this amendment had passed, the House would have adjourned, not for <HI>half an hour,</HI> but for the whole day; but then it would have seemed that they did it for their own pleasure and recreation, and not for the purpose of compli∣menting General Washington, the only thing that Mr. Gallatin seems to have been afraid of.</P>
<P>This proposed amendment is an excellent ex∣planation of the ambiguous excuse, <Q>that it was the duty of the House first to attend to the dis∣charge of their legislative functions.</Q> What! would their duty permit them to separate for <HI>the whole day,</HI> and not permit them to separate for <HI>half an hour?</HI> these gentlemen seem to count time as the French do their assignats; a thirtieth part is more valuable than the whole. Mr. Gallatin appears to have scorned the subterfuge. No matter how much time was spent, or in what manner, so that it was
<PB N="31" REF="030219_0032_0FE526A9E02F49D0"/>
not for the express purpose of waiting on the Pre∣sident; so that the insult was rendered acute.</P>
<P>What must have been the President's reflections, when he read the sketch of this debate? an intrud∣ing foreigner, a mere adventurer, who never sat his foot in the United States, until long after the revolution, comes here to arraign the conduct of General Washington, to alienate the affections of the people from him, while he basks in the sunshine of his government, and reaps the fruits of his val∣our and his wisdom. And, what are the services Mr. Gallatin ever rendered America? is this que∣stion necessary? where is the man who does not recollect the alarm, the distress, caused by the Western Insurrection? the million and a half of dollars that it cost the Union, besides immense pri∣vate sacrifices? fifteen thousand men forced from their business and their homes, to undergo one of the most fatiguing marches ever performed, and which many of them did not survive, cannot alrea∣dy be forgotten. Ask any of these men; ask the families, the widows and orphans, of those who lost their lives in this expedition, what are the ser∣vices Mr. Gallatin has rendered their country. And yet this man now raises his head among the legislators of the United States, and refuses thirty minutes of respect to the very man, to whose leni∣ty, to whose <HI>amnesty</HI> alone he owes, that he is now in a situation to insult him.</P>
<P>When I compare the determination of the House of Representatives of this day, with their conduct and that of the people, at the time of the President's installation, I blush for them.—His journey from his seat in Virginia to New York, was almost one continued triumphal entry. As he approached the towns, he found the road decked with laurel and
<PB N="32" REF="030219_0033_0FE5263CD5C906C0"/>
strewed with flowers. Sometimes he was hailed with the firing of cannon, at others with the ring∣ing of bells, and every where with the shouts of the multitude. Processions were formed to con∣duct him, the magistrates, the military, men of all trades, companies of matrons and choirs of white-robed virgins. It were vain to attempt an account of the festivals, balls, galas, fireworks, illuminati∣ons, mottos, sonnets, and odes, in honour of the "Saviour of his Country."—<Q>Merit (said one of his panegyrists on this occasion)</Q> Merit must be great indeed, <Q>when it can call forth such hon∣ours from a free and enlightened people. Hon∣ours due to a man, whose life has been one se∣ries of labours, which are upon a scale that hea∣ven never before assigned to mortal. <HI>Future ge∣nerations</HI> will say of him with the poet:</Q>
<Q><L>"So near perfection, that he stood</L>
<L>"Upon the bound'ry line</L>
<L>"Of finite from <HI>infinite good,</HI></L>
<L>"Of human from <HI>divine.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Will "future generations" believe, that, in less than seven years after this unbounded strain of pa∣negyric was in vogue, the Representatives of the people came to a formal determination, that <HI>half an hour</HI> was too much to be wasted in congratu∣lating this same man on the return of his Birth-Day?</P>
<P>When the President first accepted the honoura∣ble post he now fills, what was the state of this country? Suffice it to say, that it was such as ex∣cited shame at home and contempt from abroad. His acceptance of the Presidency inspired a kind of national joy; it was the presage of a prosperity that
<PB N="33" REF="030219_0034_0FE5273C9A47C498"/>
was to heal the wounds of a long and tiresome state of discredit and confusion. The people clung to him as the anchor of their hope: and, have they been deceived? Have not the riches and prosperity of the whole country far outstripped what could be hoped for by the most sanguine? More has been accomplished in the short space of seven years, under the Federal government than was accomplished in an age, under any other go∣vernment in the world. If, then, the President merited such high eulogiums, at the time of his tak∣ing on him the administration of this government, what does he merit now? Certainly he does not merit to be insulted. Certainly <HI>thirty minutes</HI> of adjournment would not have been too much for a man, who, a few years ago, <Q>stood upon the boundary line between human and divine good∣ness.</Q></P>
<P>Do the gentlemen of the House of Representa∣tives recollect, that not only our eyes but the eyes of the world are on them? What will other nati∣ons say to us? What will Europeans, who look on General Washington as the first of mankind, and who have heard and admired all our praises bestowed on him, what will they think of us and our Representatives, when they are told of this thir∣ty minutes decision. We have often boasted that our President was happier than any monarch upon earth, as reigning in the hearts of a free people. I hope this tone will cease, until we take effectual measures to guard him against future indignities. When a king is insulted, we see all the worthy part of his subjects press forward to the throne with as∣surances of their love and esteem, and pledging their lives and fortunes for his security. Here a certain torpidity seems to pervade all this class of society: if their wishes are kind and sincere, they
<PB N="34" REF="030219_0035_0FE52669842D9480"/>
are useless, as long as they do not break out into action.</P>
<P>But, it would be unjust not to say, that this de∣cision of the House of Representatives, was very far from being sanctioned by the voice of the peo∣ple. That voice breathed sentiments very different from those of the opposers of Mr. Smith's motion for an adjournment; and of this the House had a striking and humiliating proof.—For my part, the motion was no sooner lost than I quitted the Gallery, boiling with indignation, and went to par∣take in the jollity of the day; but, the next morning, I had the satisfaction of reading the fol∣lowing extracts from the debates, that took place in my absence. <Q><HI>Mr. Nichols,</HI> says the reporter, offered his observations on the bill; but, from the firing of cannon, beating of drums, ringing of bells, and huzzas, <HI>in honour of the President's Birth-Day,</HI> it was impossible to hear what he said.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing on earth was ever more apropos than this. How must the opposers of the motion have felt? something like a king of England, when he heard the shouts of his soldiers for the acquittal of the bishops, whose disgrace and ruin he had con∣templated. If ever malice met its true reward, it was at this moment. As if the people had said: <Q>you have aimed a blow at the reputation of our friend and father: you wish to persuade us, that he is no longer worthy of our love and veneration; but you shall not succeed. He is as dear to us as ever. You may continue your harrangues; but we will drown your voices with our accla∣mations for the return of the happy day, that gave him to the world.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030219_0036_0FE5274B3A92B488"/>It is with triumphant satisfaction I observe, that the 22nd of February was never so honoured as this year. Every State, every town in the Union, re∣sounded with festivity and joy. The city of Phila∣delphia, ever distinguished for its attachment to the President, seemed truly sensible of the treasure it possessed. The theatre, the circus, the ball-rooms, even those of private parties, were decorated with emblems of his wise and heroic deeds. Every heart overflowed with gladness and gratitude. A few so∣litary breasts in Congress alone, mourned amidst the joyous scene; as the poisonous plants under the torrid zone are said to flag and droop, while those of salubrious qualities raise their heads, flourish and bloom.</P>
<P>Though I am not an admirer of <HI>toasts,</HI> I shall close this article with one, drank at <HI>Newark,</HI> as it seems to express the general sentiment of the peo∣ple of the United States, on this occasion. <Q>The illustrious <HI>Washington,</HI> our beloved President, in whom are united the talents of a consummate General, an honest Patriot, and an enlightened Statesman. May the day of his nativity be marked in the calendar of time, and consecrated as a festival worthy of the celebration of the latest ages; but let blackness of darkness for ever rest upon the accursed hour, that gave ex∣istence to <HI>his unprincipled calumniators.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE BILL AUTHORIZING A LOAN FOR THE USE OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON.
<DATE>February 23rd.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This debate was very long, and rather uninteresting; but, as I mean to speak on it myself, I cannot with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dour refuse to give a sketch of what was said by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two of my opponents, to enable the reader to judge be∣tween us.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK (who spoke on the same side that I shall do) said, that he objected to the bill generally upon the same ground as yesterday, with respect to joining the securities of the lots and the faith of the United States to∣gether. He asked how the passing of this bill could give value to the buildings of the Federal City? Is it not, said he, already enacted that Congress shall fit there in the year 1801? The value of the lots, he said, was to be increased only by the selling them to a number of per∣sons. The city must owe its prosperity to its peculiar ad∣vantages as a commercial spot, and not from its being the seat of government. It was, therefore, the interest of the United States to sell the lots and induce the people to set∣tle there. The higher price the lots bore, the greater would be the obstacles to settlement. If it was the inten∣tion of the United States to grant money for the completion of the buildings let the House say so. When it was first proposed to remove the government to the Federal city, it was said that it would be the interest of persons to give lots to encourage the government to come there. The secu∣rity now asked for was never contemplated. He had, however, no objection to the United States granting money, but he was against the making of two loans, one on the credit of the United States, and another on that of the United States, and certain lots.</P>
<P>Mr. BRENT (from Virginia) said, that it had been ob∣served, that if the lots be a sufficient surety for the loan, why guaranty it? at present, he said, the lots were not sufficient. Mr. Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> served, <HI>that the bill before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="37" REF="030219_0038_0FE526C7887901A0"/>
considered as the touchstone to determine whether the seat of govern∣ment will go to the banks of the Potomack, or not.</HI> Motives of poli∣cy and economy, and objections to increasing the public debt, will not apply in this case; the very act provides funds to guaranty the loan, for though the property, until the proposed loan be guarantied, would sell for <HI>a mere trifle,</HI> when it is <HI>guarantied,</HI> it will sell for a <HI>great price;</HI> so great a difference would it make, that he believed property which will then sell for two millions of dollars, would not otherwise be worth 100,000 dollars. If, therefore, gen∣tlemen are against the bill from economical views, they are mistaken; for, it was his opinion, that the property would not only pay off the loan, but eventually <HI>be a consi∣derable fund towards the discharge of the public debt.</HI> It had been suggested that the United States were under no ob∣ligation to make this guarantee. He thought differently; he believed the credit of the United States materially con∣cerned. The public have relied fully upon the counte∣nance of government in the business, many persons, in∣deed, have made great sacrifices to procure lots in this new city, and, if after holding out temptations to people, government should not go there at the proposed time, all these persons will be ruined, and <HI>a stain will be laid on the national character.</HI> He hoped, therefore, no objection would be made to carrying the bill into effect.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES (from Virginia) wished to remark on what had fallen from a member from Pennsylvania yesterday, with re∣spect to the law providing for the removal of the seat of go∣vernment. <HI>That law, he said, differed from all others.</HI> The Constitution itself, he said, prescribes the rule, the act only fixes the spot where it should be carried into effect. <HI>The act is, therefore, not repealable.</HI> The Constitution does not give a power to fix upon two spots, but upon one spot. He thought it necessary to make this remark, lest he might be supposed to countenance the opinion he comba∣ted. It had been remarked, that it would be in some de∣gree degrading to the United States, to borrow money on the credit of lots; he thought differently, and shewed that it was a common thing in governments to borrow money on different funds. It had been wished to disconnect the government from the business—whilst government guarantied the loan, he said, it would make no difference
<PB N="38" REF="030219_0039_0FE526AD58A91858"/>
whether the loan was bottomed on the lots or otherwise. The nature of the engagement was the same. The que∣stion was whether the House would agree to guaranty the loan, or not.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES said, that he had seen and was acquainted with the buildings carrying on in the Federal city. He thought <HI>the house erecting for the residence of the President was much too magnificent,</HI> much more so than was intend∣ed. Every one thought so who saw it; but this was no reason for obstructing the progress of the business. He hoped the bill would be formed in a manner so as to meet the general sense of the House. Though he had <HI>objected to the grandeur of the house intended for the President,</HI> he would have the buildings <HI>for congress erected on a grand scale, and fitted for the representatives of a great and free peo∣ple.</HI></P>
<P>The Bill was finally recommitted.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The reader has heard what was said on both sides of this question, and I have now to beg him to at∣tend to what I would have said, had I been a mem∣ber of Congress.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. CHAIRMAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is well known, that I am no orator; that I speak right on, making my tongue the true inter∣preter of my heart. You will not therefore ex∣pect from me the wily sophistry of a G—tin, the quibbling of a G—les, the verbosity of a B—win, or the patriotic bombast of a Liv—ton.</P>
<P>It is seldom, Sir, that I trouble the House with my sentiments on any question whatever. There are so many gentlemen among us, who are speechi∣fiers by profession, who deck every subject, howe∣ver sterile and trifling, with all the flowers of the
<PB N="39" REF="030219_0040_0FE5266B62153070"/>
garden of eloquence, that a plain spokesman like me can have little chance of being heard with any degree of patience. On the present occasion, how∣ever, these gentlemen do not seem to be come, like the bee, loaded with sweets; the few they have brought with them are already scattered abroad, and have lost their fragrance: and, as the day is not yet far enough advanced to countenance an adjournment, permit me to hope for indulgence, while I humbly endeavour to spin out the time be∣tween this and dinner; or, as our ploughmen have it, while I take a gentle turn to wind down the sun.</P>
<P>Should gentlemen find themselves inclined to repose, as I have often been in listening to them, I beg them not to stand upon ceremony, but to loll back at their ease, and leave me to jog qui∣etly on.</P>
<P>We are called upon, Sir, to <HI>guaranty</HI> a loan, for which the lots of the City of Washington are to be a <HI>security;</HI> and the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Brent, tells us, that, though the lots are at present worth but a <HI>mere trifle,</HI> they will, when guarantied, be of <HI>great value.</HI> This is rather ob∣scure, I shall therefore endeavour to explain it by comparison; which, I make no doubt, I shall do to the satisfaction of the House. Suppose I had a lot, not worth a brass farthing, and was to draw a note payable out of the produce of this same lot, such note would be worth but a <HI>"mere trifle;"</HI> but, when endorsed by a man of credit, it would be <HI>"of great value;"</HI> because the holder would al∣ways know where to look for payment.</P>
<P>But the friends of the guarantee do not stop here. They assure us, that it would render the
<PB N="40" REF="030219_0041_0FE5271DE5AE1A58"/>
lots so very valuable as to <Q>create a considerable fund towards the discharge of the public debt!</Q> Much as I wish to see that debt discharged, I by no means approve of its being done by taking ad∣vantage of an overstrained generosity. The Vir∣ginians have most generously bestowed part of the land, and, not content with that, they now offer us an opportunity of paying off the public debt with speculations in the lots. I am one of those who are willing to forego any and every offer of this kind. I am willing that the Virginians themselves should be permitted to guaranty this loan, and re∣ceive exclusively all the immense advantages accru∣ing therefrom. Let them undertake the negocia∣tion upon their own bottom, which, from the great credit they enjoy in foreign countries, they cannot fail to effect upon the most reasonable terms.</P>
<P>It is said, that foreigners will not venture their money on the lots, because they can form no idea of their value; neither can I, and this is another reason for my wishing to leave the business in the hands of those who are upon the spot, and who seem to be the only persons interested in the matter.</P>
<P>The gentleman, who made us the bounteous proposal for paying off the public debt by the means of the guarantee, concluded with an argument, which, I believe, he conceived to carry more weight with it: that is; unless the government went to the City of Washington at the time specified by the act, it would be <HI>"a stain on the national character."</HI>— I participate with Mr. Brent in his anxiety for our national character, and am glad to have it in my power to convince him, that it could be in no dan∣ger from the disappointment he seems so much afraid of. We see a very considerable State of the
<PB N="41" REF="030219_0042_0FE5272CCD5D0928"/>
Union, Sir, tenaciously adhering to a law, made expressly to skreen its citizens from the obligation of discharging their just debts; and we have seen this very House pass a resolution for the sequestration of all debts, due from Americans to their creditors in Great Britain. Neither of these has ever been called a stain on our national character; and, if these are not, if our character is proof against these, I imagine we have little to fear from the go∣vernments' remaining at Philadelphia. I will men∣tion another instance, Sir, still stronger. If we look back into the journals of Congress, we shall find the king of France stiled, our <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good ally,</HI> our <HI>friend</HI> and <HI>deliverer;</HI> and yet we have applauded his murd................ [there the Chairman would have called me to or∣der, upon which I should have said]—Sir, I should be sorry to break through the rules of this House; and, I must insist that I am perfectly in order. The gentleman from Virginia had laid great stress on what he presumed would be a stain on our natio∣nal character. I looked upon myself as entitled to prove, that he was mistaken; and I certainly had a right to do this, by bringing forward what I con∣ceived to be much better calculated to impress a stain, and which, however, had not produced that effect. If, therefore, there was any deviation from the question, the gentleman led the way, and I was only following him. Besides, Sir, look over the debates of this House, and you will see to what a nut-shell compass they will be reduced, if you exclude all the extraneous matter. If members are to be bound down to the simple question before them, if no latitude of digression is allowed of, no little rambles to France for eulogium and to Great Britain for invective, how do you imagine, Sir, that <HI>patriotic</HI> members would be able to give proofs
<PB N="42" REF="030219_0043_0FE5266CE4BE6EE0"/>
of their diligence, by eking out the session to six or seven months?—Your assent, Sir, to the just∣ness of these observations, encourages me to take up the thread of my argument.</P>
<P>If, on the day of our pompous reception of the French Flag, poor murdered Louis had risen up through the floor, and said: <Q>Ungrateful Ameri∣cans! you who flattered me in the hour of my prosperity and your distress; you who called me your deliverer; you who made public rejoicings for the day of my nativity, are now joining hands with the very men who led me to the block; are expressing "your sincere and lively sensibili∣ty, your sympathy and affection" towards them; are giving a pompous reception to the emblems of their triumph over me, at the very moment that my portrait, which was to be the memento of my services and of your gratitude, is hang∣ing up within your walls.</Q>—If the spectre of this injured prince had thus spoken, what should we have said? I know a member who would have replied: Avaunt, "ermined monster!" But, for my part, I should have felt the stain: I should have thought myself spotted as a leopard. And yet, Sir, this has never been mentioned as a stain on our na∣tional character. To apprehend, therefore, any danger from our not removing to the banks of the Patomack, is to strain at a gnat, while we swallow a giant.</P>
<P>Much has been said, Sir, on the manner in which the buildings of the City of Washington have been conducted. This is a branch of the subject that I should have passed over in silence, had it not been for an expression or two that fell from another gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Giles. That gentleman
<PB N="43" REF="030219_0044_0FE526FE282FC7E0"/>
observed, that <Q>the house erecting for the residence of the President was <HI>much too magnificent;</HI>" but that, though he <HI>objected to the grandeur</HI> of the house intended for <HI>the President,</HI> he would have the buildings <HI>for Congress</HI> erected upon a <HI>grand scale,</HI> and fitted for the <HI>Representatives</HI> of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free people.</HI></Q>—I do not choose, Sir, to let this sally go abroad unnoticed, lest the world should imagine us all tainted with that ungovernable vani∣ty, which seems to have engrossed the soul of our unfortunate colleague.</P>
<P>The gentleman is afraid that the house of the President may be <HI>too magnificent;</HI> but that which he expects to occupy <HI>himself,</HI> he wishes to see upon a <HI>grand scale</HI>—Modest man! The President is to be kept within the walls of a plain building, to remind him of the lowliness of his estate, of his being the <HI>servant</HI> of the public; while Mr. Giles is to strut beneath the roof of buildings upon a <HI>grand scale,</HI> fitted for the <HI>Representatives</HI> of a <HI>great people;</HI> or, in other words, for the <HI>great Representatives</HI> of the people.</P>
<P>I am thinking, Sir, that the public will do well to keep <HI>us</HI> within a plain building, or I am afraid our heads will soon be turned. We are in absolute need of being dieted, for we are grasping not only at all honour but at all power too. If we once enter the pile proposed by our colleague; if we once get under tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: corinthian columns and starry vaults, we shall expect other things on a <HI>"grand scale"</HI> also; we must hvae our coaches-and-six, our led horses, our pages, our grooms, our hunts∣men and our buck-hounds; our villas, baths, sofas and beds of state. We may expect, in due time, to hear the gentleman from Virginia propose a <HI>se∣raglio</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="030219_0045_0FE5272E5127C8E0"/>
as among the conveniences of the <Q><HI>Repre∣presentatives</HI> of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> people.</Q></P>
<P>Much do I fear, Sir, that if we were once got in possession of all these pretty things, we should be very loath to return to our humble dwellings and our homely fare. In short, I think we should do like the <HI>great Representatives</HI> of the French; that is, declare ourselves permanent, or, at least, order the people to elect nobody but ourselves, which amounts to exactly the same.</P>
<P>But, we are told, that this building upon a <HI>grand scale,</HI> is not intended as an honour to us, but to our constituents. This is the very gull-trap which the poor silly French have fallen into. Every thing that their grovelling low-bred tyrants have assumed to themselves, has been done under the specious pretext of doing honour <Q>to a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> peo∣ple.</Q> They have scized on all the palaces in the kingdom, on the royal studs, coaches, and every other article of luxury, for their own exclusive use; they wallow in sumptuousness, while their rag∣ged slaves have but two or three ounces of dirty-coloured bread a day, and, if they murmur, they shoot them down by thousands; and, all this is for the "honour of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> people." A great people, a free people, a sovereign people, and the like, are very pretty phrases: they tickle the ears of the multitude; but, should they per∣ceive how completely the demagogues transfer this grandeur, liberty, and sovereignty, to themselves, perhaps they would cease to admire them; and no∣thing seems better calculated to open their eyes, than seeing them in a splendid palace, while they, many of them at least, are obliged to put up with log-huts.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030219_0046_0FE5266E66B4EF80"/>It is become a prevailing fashion, among the op∣posers of our government, to confine the expres∣sion, "Representatives of the people," to this House only. But, Sir, is not this a very false, as well as dangerous notion? Is not the President the Representative of the people as well as Mr. Giles? Yes, and of the whole of the people too, while Mr. Giles represents but a very small part of one State. The epithet <HI>immediate</HI> is sometimes prefix∣ed; but then, Mr. Giles can be the <HI>immediate re∣presentative</HI> of no more than an eighteenth part of the State of Virginia, while the President is the im∣mediate representative of the whole Union; for the representation must ever be immediate, though the election may not. If therefore, a preference is due to any branch of the government, the Presi∣dent seems to have a better title to it than any of us, and seeing the thing in this light, I cannot help looking upon the observation of the gentle∣man from Virginia as extremely improper, if not indecent.</P>
<P>I thought, Sir, I heard the word <HI>Capitol</HI> menti∣oned during the debate. For the love of modesty, I hope the Congress House is not to be called a <HI>Capitol!</HI> If this be the case, it will be necessary to go a step further, and assume the masquerade dress of the French Romans. How pretty we shall look in long white robes, descending to our toes, a blue girdle about our waists, a scarlet cloak on our shoulders, and a red liberty cap on our heads! Let them all be well embroidered with gold, as those of the French legislators <HI>are to be;</HI> and, if they are even set with precious stones, it will be an ad∣ditional proof of our jealousy for the honour of "a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free people.</HI>" We shall, indeed, bring on us a ridicule equal to that excited by the
<PB N="46" REF="030219_0047_0FE52677A1C31100"/>
upstart pettifoggers of the National Assembly, when they insisted on the Folding-Doors of the Louvre to be thrown open at their approach; but, let the world be merry while we are swagg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring about in our consular robes, we shall care but little whe∣ther we are called ambitious buffoons or not.</P>
<P>This idea of a <HI>Capitol</HI> seems to be borrowed from the State of Virginia, the Assembly-House of which has taken that name. For what reason it was there adopted, I know not, unless it be, that there are such numbers of Caesars and Pompeys in the neighbourhood, against whose ambitious pro∣jects the grave and virtuous senate are ever vigilant to preserve the liberty of their country. The <HI>Ca∣pitol</HI> of Virginia resembles that of Rome also, in that it has a <HI>slave mart</HI> in its vicinity,</P>
<P>I shall now, Sir, return to the proposed guaran∣tee, and advert to another of the forcible argu∣ments of Mr. Brent. <Q>This gentleman tells us, that the guarantee is the touchstone to prove whether the seat of government is to be removed or not.</Q> I am willing to take the gentleman at his word. I am willing to allow, that refusing the guarantee of the loan, will amount to a declaration of our wish to remain where we are; and, with this view, I shall give the refusal my hearty support..... [Here a loud cry of, hear him! hear him!]—I am glad to find, Mr. Chairman, that gentlemen are so disposed to hear; for, I can assure them, that, what I have to say, is not only worth hearing, but attending to also.</P>
<P>I look forward, Sir, to the day of removing the government to the banks of the Potomack, as the dawn of its destruction. Open the page of history,
<PB N="47" REF="030219_0048_0FE52647D99BF820"/>
and you will see, that the sate of every popular go∣vernment in a great measure depends on the dispo∣sition of the people immediately in its neighbour∣hood. I could cite you a thousand examples, from the fall of the Grecian States down to our own times; but I shall content myself with one of modern date; and, as the gentlemen on the other side of the House are so fond of flying to France, I trust I shall be excused for doing the same.</P>
<P>When the Constituent Assembly conceived the destructive project of annihilating the government, which their constituents had positively ordered them to aid and strengthen, what did they do? Remo∣ved themselves to Paris, where they knew the great∣est number of disaffected persons were assembled. The consequences are but too well known.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant of the general disposition of the State to which this government is to be re∣moved. We have seen its legislature, during this very session, soliciting every State in the Union to join them in reducing this government to a mere democracy. Nor can any of us have forgotten the public invitation to the people of other States, to oppose the treaty with His Britannic Majesty by open force, boasting that there were <Q>a hun∣dred thousand free and independent Virginians,</Q> ready to strike the first blow. Can it be supposed, then, if we were now assembled at the City of Washington, that these hundred thousand free and independent Virginians, whether black, white or yel∣low, would not dictate to us all we should dare to say or do? Do you think, Sir, that the cutting truths which have this day fallen from my lips, would ever have been uttered in the City of Wash∣ington?
<PB N="48" REF="030219_0049_0FE52691F1F64C68"/>
No; I should have expected to have my throat cut, or my eyes gouged out, by some slave or slave-dealer, before I got home to my dinner. I will never go there, Sir; and, to those gentle∣men who do, I sincerely recommend the precauti∣on of a steel collar, if not a suit of armour <HI>cap-à-pié.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. GILES has told us, Sir, that the law for the removal of the seat of government differs from all others; that <Q>the Constitution itself has mark∣ed the <HI>rule,</HI> and only left Congress to name the spot; that the law is therefore not <HI>repealable.</HI></Q> Curious quibble!—The Constitution says, that the Congress shall <Q>exercise exclusive legislation over such district as may become the seat of government of the United States.</Q>—Now, what is there here, that makes the act unrepealable? What <HI>rule</HI> is here marked out? Is there a word about the law being unalterable? Does the Constitution say, that when the district is once fixed on, it shall ne∣ver be changed for another? There is something so ridiculous in the idea, that one would wonder how it ever found its way into words; and, to hazard those words, the gentleman must have a very high opinion of the forbearance of this House. Suppose, for instance, the banks of the Potomack should be visited with the plague or yellow fever; are we to remain there, and let our carcasses be thrown into the river? Suppose a vulcano or earthquake, or, in short, suppose what you will; are we yet bound to make the City of Washing∣ton the seat of government? And what, I ask, are plagues, yellow fevers, vulcanos and earthquakes, compared with the knives of "a hundred thousand <HI>free</HI> and <HI>independent" slaves?</HI>—In a word, Mr. Chairman, so fully am I convinced, that the re∣moval
<PB N="49" REF="030219_0050_0FE527024D158490"/>
of the seat of government to the State of Virginia will prove the overthrow of our happy Constitution, and eventually plunge our country in anarchy and blood, that I shall not only oppose every measure that may accelerate the fatal epoch, but I pledge myself to bring forward a motion for the repeal of the act altogether.—And now, Sir, as I see the gentlemen from Virginia are bursting with reply, I sit down, satisfied of having discharg∣ed my duty, without giving offence to any one, to whose ears truth is not disagreeable.</P>

<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE MEASURES TO BE TA∣KEN TO PREVENT THE IMPRESSMENT OF AMERICAN SEAMEN.
<DATE>February 18th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON (N. York) said he would call the at∣tention of the house to the situation of a very important and meritorious class of men whose value seemed to have been over looked and whose dearest rights were either shamefully neglected or ignominiously surrendered—He adverted to the seamen of the United States. This valu∣able class of men would fall under one of these descripti∣ons▪</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Native American Citizens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Such as were citizens at the Declaration of Indepen∣dence and at the period of the peace with Great Britain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Foreigners naturalized since the Declaration of inde∣pendence.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>It would be no difficult matter to prove that all the in∣dividuals of either of those descriptions were equally enti∣tled to the protection of government; to the same or great∣er exertions in <HI>their</HI> favor than were made for those citi∣zens whose situation rendered it easier to apply for relief.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="030219_0051_0FE526C90DB9D6F8"/>Yet this meritorious body of our constituents, he said, thus entitled to our protection and favor, sailing under the sanction of our national flag, had been illegally seized, violently forced into a service they abhorred, cruelly torn from their relations, their families and their country, and ignominiously scourged for asserting the privileges of their citizenship. The country to which they looked for pro∣tection and relief had regarded their sufferings with apa∣thy and indifference! Three years we had beheld their mi∣series and heard their cries; yet for three years we had been silent spectators of this disgraceful scene. We had begun a compact with their oppressors, in which these unfortunate men looked in vain for one word of comfort in their misery, for one little article in the voluminous pa∣ges of the instrument, that might offer a hope of recom∣pence for their past sufferings, or security against future op∣pressions. <Q><HI>I blush</HI> (said Mr. Livingston) as an Ameri∣can to think it was an American Minister who could be <HI>guilty</HI> of this <HI>disgraceful omission.</HI> I should be <HI>covered with shame</HI> and confusion <HI>for my Country</HI> if I could suppose it capable of giving that omission its sanction, and I hold it a sacred duty, in whatever station I may be placed, to contri∣bute every exertion, and the little influence I possess, for their relief.</Q>—He concluded with moving the following resolution:</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> that a committee be appointed to enquire and report whether any and what legislative provision is neces∣sary for the relief of such American Seamen as may have been impressed into the service of any foreign power—and also to report a mode of furnishing American Seamen with such evidence of their citizenship as may protect them from foreign impressments in future.</P>
<P>Refered to a select committee.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="continuation of debate">
<HEAD>February 29th.</HEAD>
<P>The committee made their report, the substance of which was; that the impressment of American Sea-men by <HI>foreign powers</HI> was too <HI>notorious</HI> to <HI>need proof;</HI> and that the President of the United States shall send agents to <HI>England</HI> and the West Indies, in order to afford relief to such American <HI>citizens,</HI> as have been illegally seized.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="030219_0052_0FE52697AA558640"/>Mr. HARPER (S. Carolina) hoped when this resolution was committed to a select committee, some statements would have been brought forward, some facts produced, upon which to found the proposed enquiry. The com∣mittee have reported that they do not think it necessary to adduce any particular instances in which American Seamen have been impressed by foreign nations, the facts, they alledged, are too notorious to require particu∣larizing. He could not suppose these gentlemen would believe that the House could proceed to legislate on un∣certain newspaper reports. He trusted they would afford some proof who, what number, when, and where Ame∣rican seamen have been impressed. Until this was done, he should doubt the fact.—He was heard, he believed, by Representatives from every port in the United States, and if the fact was so notorious as to need no further evi∣dence, he doubted not some of these gentlemen would be able to give some account of the business.</P>
<P>If the facts were established, Mr. Harper believed there would be but one opinion on the propriety of grant∣ing relief; but before they proceeded farther, some infor∣mation was necessary respecting the existence of this abuse. He had applied to the office of the Secretary of State, and to other offices likely to afford information on the subject; but he found no instance of the impressment complained of, which redress had not been given. But, if any such in∣stances do exist, in which relief has been applied for, and not obtained, gentlemen from some of the sea ports will be able to mention them. If not, he hoped the commit∣tee would rise and recommit the report.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON said, the present measure was intend∣ed to afford relief to such of their distressed fellow citizens as had been illegally seized on the high seas. The gen∣tleman, he said, who brings forward objections to the pro∣posed enquiry, was in his place when the resolution upon which the report of the committee is founded, passed un∣animously. Why did he not then come forward; [Mr. Harper said he was not in the House at the time.]—The resolution does not direct the committee to enquire into facts, they were considered as notorious, and nothing

seemed necessary but to fix upon the best mode of furnish∣ing relief. The Legislature of the United States have formerly had evidence, and they have acted upon it. If the gentleman will look into the proceedings of the last session of Congress, he will find a considerable sum grant∣ed to Mr. Cutting, for relief of this distressed body of men. Some he relieved, others he did not. When the dignity of the nation, said he, is insulted, in the persons of our fellow-citizens, it is necessary at least to make enquiry in∣to their sufferings.</P>
<P>A remark had fallen, Mr. Livingston said, from the member from South Carolina, which he wished to notice. He said he had applied to the office of the Secretary of State, and found there no complaint which had not been redressed. Now, he had waited upon the Secretary of State, as chairman of the committee, in vain for informa∣tion on this subject. The Secretary informed him, that he could not give him the evidence which it appears he has given to the member from South Carolina. How, he wished to know, happened it that a member who opposes the busi∣ness in question, should be furnished with that information which was denied to a member who supported it?</P>
<P>It is said, added Mr. Livingston, that we are attempting to legislate without evidence. Though no facts are at pre∣sent before the House, it is notorious that numerous in∣stances have been made known to government, and the present measure is meant to enquire into the cases of suf∣ferers and remedy them as far as possible. It is admitted by the member from South Carolina that facts have ex∣isted, but that they have been removed. If these griev∣ances, then, said he, have existed, let us prevent them in future. Let us not wait till it is too late to grant relief. The men, said he, who suffer by the depradations com∣plained of, are at a great distance from their homes and friends, in foreign ports; dragged on board Tenders, and made to experience every hardship which can be conceiv∣ed. And now, when a mode is proposed for the relief of these distressed citizens, evidence is called for! <HI>If one of these men is confined in the East Indies, can evidence of his bon∣dage be expected to be given here?</HI> Such hardships have ex∣isted, and it was their business <HI>to prevent them from again
<PB N="53" REF="030219_0054_0FE526830EBFCD78"/>
occurring.</HI> He hoped, therefore, the committee would not rise, as he trusted there was sufficient evidence on which to ground the enquiry.</P>
<P>Mr. HARPER wished to remark on what had fallen from the member from New-York, on the Secretary of State's re∣fusing information to certain members and giving it to o∣thers. He applied to the office of the Secretary of State, to learn whether there were any documents there to sup∣port the proposed enquiry, and was informed there were only two cases; in one of which application was made to the British government; <HI>four persons</HI> were said to have been impressed; but on enquiry, it appeared, <HI>that two of them were British subjects, and the other two had enlisted into the service.</HI> The other complaint came to the office when the Secretary of State was much engaged in other concerns, but he believed relief was granted. This, he said, was verbal information; he had applied for written documents on the subject, and doubted not he should receive them as soon as other business would permit.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK (Pennsylvania) said the member from S. Carolina had called for information; he conceived no particular information necessary. He could mention an instance in which he had immediate concern. A vessel of his going to the West-Indies had all her hands taken out of her, and obliged to work the guns of an English fri∣gate; and, on their expostulating that though they were prisoners they did not wish to work the guns they were threatened with whipping, and the captain was told if he interfered, he should be whipped and <HI>sent home</HI> to England in irons. If he had thought facts were wanting, by a single advertisement in one of the Philadelphia papers, they would have been overpowered with facts. But if he had done so, he supposed he should have been charged with raising dissatisfaction in the minds of the people, or with encouraging Jacobinical principles. He therefore did not do it. But, without going out of the walls of the House, he said, he found evidence sufficient. He read an extract from the communication of the Secretary of State, dated March 2, 1794, in which were mentioned the representations made by sundry merchants of Phila∣delphia (of whom he was one) respecting the impressment
<PB N="54" REF="030219_0055_0FE526CA91BBFA60"/>
of American seamen. This document was thought suf∣ficiently strong to make an article of instruction to Mr. Jay in his late negociation; but, owing to certain difficulties, no specific agreement was entered into by him for their relief.</P>
<P>The plan now before the House, said Mr. Swanwick, is in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded to remedy the difficulties which have been urged as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acles in this business, by opening registers in which to enter every American seaman, by which may be known at any time the number of seamen belonging to the Uni∣ted States, and by means of which every such seaman would be possessed of a certificate of his <HI>citizenship.</HI></P>
<P>Every one knows, said he, what has <HI>been felt</HI> on account of American seamen carried into <HI>Algiers. No evidence was required with respect to their numbers, or how they were employed.</HI> The united exertions of the whole American people <HI>seemed to cry out</HI> for their releasement, and the busi∣ness, at length, has been effected. And let us not, said he, attend to our distressed citizens, in one part only, but in all parts of the world. Let us not, said he, <HI>be too nice about evidence.</HI> These men are generally <HI>ignorant,</HI> and can∣not give the necessary information; he thought, however, they had information sufficient for legislating upon in the present case. He hoped, therefore, the report would not be recommitted, until the committee had discussed the bu∣siness.</P>
<P>Mr. TRACY (Connecticut) believed that every member in that House felt the propriety of extending the benefit of the laws to every class of citizens, and to none more than to American seamen. Some members seemed to suppose that the distresses of American seamen have been looked upon with apathy, but if due attention had been paid to the efforts of government, it would have been seen that they had always been duly attended to. It is well known that great difficulties arise when it is attempted to distin∣guish between <HI>English and American seamen.</HI> This has been the reason why ample regulations have not always taken place. He hoped the government would be popu∣lar, and that the new members in the House would assist the old ones to render it more and more so; but thought
<PB N="55" REF="030219_0056_0FE52688F7D3BB98"/>
government ought not to be charged with apathy without paying due attention to what government had done.</P>
<P>Mr. TRACY proceeded to take notice of the resolutions proposed in the report. He enquired what good the agent to be sent to Great Britain would do. Are there seamen, said he, employed but at one place? Had not the United States Consuls at every port, and can they not do the bu∣siness? He wished for information on the subject. <HI>A great part of the seamen were foreigners,</HI> he said, and it would be very difficult to separate them. If the plan pro∣posed, however, could be made to appear to be beneficial, he would heartily join in effecting the desired relief to the class of citizens alluded to.</P>
<P>Mr. GOODHUE (Massachusetts) said the member from New York, on bringing forward this business, had charg∣ed government with looking upon the distresses of Ame∣rican seamen with apathy, and <HI>blushed</HI> on account of its conduct towards them. He represented, he believed, twenty times the number of American seamen that that gentleman represented; he was himself, indeed, formerly a seaman; yet he did not believe the evil complained of existed to any alarming degree. Mr. Cutting, it had been said, had relieved many seamen; that it was in the year 1790. Last summer the British took many vessels bound to France but they did not take the crews. There were some instances, he said, in which seamen had been impres∣sed, and he should be in favour of every necessary step to afford them relief; but no obloquy should be thrown on government. Neither does the evil exist to the extent it might have been supposed, when the business was brought forward. A member from Pennsylvania had mentioned a particular instance: he could mention a particular in∣stance of a French captain who had so ill-treated some American seamen, as to be cashiered, on a representation being made to the French government.</P>
<P>Mr. DAYTON (New Jersey) said that he had not ex∣pected an opposition to the resolution under consideration on the ground of fact, that he could not have supposed any member would have questioned the existence of the
<PB N="56" REF="030219_0057_0FE5270D291768C0"/>
evils, which the propositions were calculated to remedy. He entertained a belief that the impressment of American seamen, particularly on board of British ships of war, was a matter of too great notoriety, to need any evidence at this time. But the member from South Carolina, who manifested the most zealous opposition to these measures, had admitted that there had existed instances of this sort, and as it must follow that what had once existed might again exist, it behoved Congress to make provisions tend∣ing to prevent, or at least most speedily and efficaciously to remedy them.</P>
<P>Mr Dayton declared that he heartily approved the ob∣ject of the resolution, as originally proposed by the mem∣ber from New York, and the general principles of the re∣port founded thereon, as a question of humanity, and of great national policy. It was, however, with pain that he heard the worthy mover draw into unfavourable que∣stion, the conduct of the Secretary of State, and indulge himself in some severe reflections and imputations upon that officer. Mr. Dayton ascribed it to an irritability, and perhaps an honest irritability, upon this subject so affect∣ing and interesting to Americans. He ascribed it to a warmth of temper in which, in this particular case, the cooler judgment of that gentleman, and the knowledge of the real character and conduct of the Secretary of State had no agency or influence. The expressions which had been uttered by some gentlemen in the course of the dis∣cussion tending to charge our government with a criminal apathy and indifference towards this description of citizens, did by no means, Mr. Dayton said, meet with his appro∣bation. He believed them to be unfounded, for he was persuaded that whenever it heard, it did whatever it could to relieve the seamen of the United States, and to obtain for those who unfortunately needed it, complete redress. Having said thus much in vindication of the conduct of the government he returned to the resolution itself, and declared himself its advocate. It contained neither in its words nor spirit, any imputation upon the Executive, of the sort hinted at.</P>
<P>In the former case, every one must perceive it more than possible, that owing to distance and the time which
<PB N="57" REF="030219_0058_0FE526DA1B056F48"/>
must consequently be expended in the communication to, and remonstrance from our government, an <HI>American citi∣zen</HI> might be impressed and compelled to serve months, perhaps years in a service which he detested, <HI>and possibly forced to apply the match to a cannon charged with balls aimed for the destruction of his friends.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. BOURNE (Rhode Island) proposed to amend the re∣solution, by striking out that part of it which appoints an agent for Great Britain and confines the sending of an agent to that part of the English possessions in the West Indies to which the greatest number of American vessels sail.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON was pleased to see gentlemen concur in endeavouring to form a plan for the relief of American seamen. It has been asked why the Consuls were not entrusted with this business; the committee considered that, as the Consuls of the United States received no other recom∣pence for their services, than the dignity and consequence which, their office gives them, they would not be likely to pay sufficient attention to a business of this kind. They considered the immense labour of Mr. Cutting to deliver the impressed American seamen. They supposed, there∣fore, if the duty were laid upon the Consuls, a salary should be annexed to their office? but, as there is no Con∣sul in the West Indies, a special agent should be appoint∣ed.—In order to bring a view of the business before the House, he would ask, how relief is to be afforded to a seaman who has been impressed? Suppose he is seized in London, he is sent down to Portsmouth. The agent must attend immediately, get certificates, pay fees of office, employ council, &amp;c. to release a single seaman; a trouble he believed no Consul would take. The committee sup∣posed that the solemnity of commissioning an agent especi∣ally on the business, would convince <HI>Foreign powers</HI> that they would no longer <HI>suffer the British,</HI> or others, to exer∣cise that power over American seamen which they them∣selves could not exercise. It is to be hoped, also, that when the government of Great Britain sees a step of this sort taken, it will give up the practice of seizing American seamen, and let them pass in quietness. If not, the agents employed could transmit to this country an account of what seamen were seized by them, and every particularly
<PB N="58" REF="030219_0059_0FE52720A7E72238"/>
respecting the same. This consideration influenced the committee, and he trusted it would influence the House.</P>
<P>Mr. S. SMITH (Maryland) said that as the member from South Carolina had called upon gentlemen from sea ports for evidence, if they were silent, it would be sup∣posed no information could be given on the subject under discussion. He supposed he should be prevented from giv∣ing this information now, because the amendment of the first resolution was under consideration. [The House cal∣led for information.] He said he represented a port where the fact of American seamen being impressed by the Brit∣ish was <HI>so notorious,</HI> that <HI>every</HI> man knew it. But how, said he, is this information to be got and transmitted to the Secretary of State, no complaint is likely to reach his office, except brought there by merchants. In his <HI>own trade,</HI> he had frequent instances of this sort, almost in every voyage. He could <HI>not say the men impressed were al∣ways Americans, but they were men sailing under the authori∣ty of the United States.</HI> We have a flag, under that flag men are seized, and they have a right to expect, when seized, redress from government. There is <HI>no difference</HI> between <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Algerines,</HI> for, by the former, they are compelled to fight against those whom they <HI>wish well,</HI> which <HI>is equal to any slavery that can be imposed.</HI> He said, that from one of his ships there were two New-England men impressed; one of whom being a stout, courageous man, wished to have defended himself against his assai∣lants; but the supercargo said, no, this will risk the car∣go of the owner. The advice he gave, supposing govern∣ment would afford these men relief.</P>
<P>If the member from South Carolina wished for <HI>such in∣formation as would be received before a court of Judicature, it could not be got.</HI> Mr. Smith thought sufficient attention had not been paid by government <HI>to merchants and seamen.</HI> Mr Jay, in his communication to Lord Grenville says, an impressment of American seamen had taken place, who had been forced to fight, &amp;c. If this had not been so, it had not been written by Mr. Jay, nor would Lord Gren∣ville have promised relief. He hoped this information would be thought sufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030219_0060_0FE5270EC0B4D110"/>It had been said that there were not many instances of American seamen impressed; but, suppose there were but one man, <HI>and be a negro,</HI> suffering under <HI>the galling yoke of impressment,</HI> it is the duty of government to provide relief for that man. The same member has said that the Quibe∣ron vessels did not impress the crews of the ships; he said it was sufficient to take their flour and pay them nine dol∣lars for what might have been sold the next day for twen∣ty or upwards.—Mr. Smith concluded by observing, that if we were a feeble nation, we had a right to expect ju∣stice; but he hoped we were not to feeble as some gentle∣men imagined.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES (Virginia) was of opinion, with the mem∣ber from Rhode Island, that American citizens should be attended to in other countries, as well as in Great Britain. He had not heard, of any <HI>impressments</HI> but by the British, but he had heard of <HI>captivities;</HI> and that House had heard of a French officer being cashiered, for ill-treating Ame∣rican citizens; but it had heard no instance of Great Bri∣tain punishing officers for ill-treating American citizens. No, this marked the different character of the two nations towards the Americans.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK rose to inform the house that since he was in his place yesterday, he had been called upon with evidence on the subject now before the committee, in consequence of the call made for it in the course of the debate. The instances he had given to him were, the case of Robert Norris a native of Princeton in New-Jersey, and <HI>five others</HI> who sailed on board the American brig Matilda, captain Burke, from Philadelphia, which sailed from this port in May last, for Bourdeaux, and were on the 9th of July, brought to by four British frigates, for∣cibly taken into the vessel, impressed and compelled to go and serve on board one of the said frigates called the Stag, where they served four months, when the said Robert Norris made his escape from the frigate at Sheerness, at the risk of his life, and returned in January last to the United States. His companions he believes are yet in bondage. The other instance was the brig Sally captain Wilkins, which sailed from this port in May last bound to Madeira, and five days after leaving the Capes was brought
<PB N="60" REF="030219_0061_0FE4FE5035B2EED8"/>
to by the Rattle Snake stoop of war, captain York, and the mate (<HI>a native of Scotland,</HI> but who had sailed for <HI>ma∣ny years</HI> out of the United States) and one of the best seamen (an American) taken out. They were carried to Hallifax, from whence the fore-mast man made his escape, and arrived here the beginning of July. Before they ar∣rived at Hallifax, he informs, that fifteen men were taken out of American vessels.—Mr. Swanwick read also an ac∣count from an owner of several other impressments.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK (Massachusetts) said, he was yesterday prevented from attending the House by indisposition. The subject struck his mind, he said, in several points of view which had not been noticed. He was surprized why the business was undertaken in the way it was. No descrip∣tion of men, he said, were more entitled to regard than seamen; but this did not reconcile the adoption of the subject in the manner proposed. The executive, he was of opinion, would consider itself as charged with this business. An agent who is neither consul nor minister, is an instrument unknown, an undefined character that would not be recognized. It was impossible, he said, for any two agents, one in Great Britain and the other in the West-Indies, to gain information of the sufferings of sea∣men in different parts of the two countries, particularly in Great Britain. He called upon gentlemen to say whe∣ther they had ever heard of such a character as they were proposing to create? He said America had consuls in every part of the world, and if they have not, they ought to have salaries for the business. Why appoint agents? and what authority will they have?</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK noticed the different kinds of Ameri∣can citizens, and of the difficulties arising from the doc∣trine of inalienable right supported by the English, and observed that when two countries each claim a right to a man no means but force was left to decide between them.</P>
<P>The resolution was amended, and a select committee ordered to prepare a bill. The substance of which in the next <HI>Censor.</HI></P>

<P>The seamen, sailing under the sanc∣tion of our national flag, have been violently forced into a service they abhor, cruelly torn from their dear wives and smiling babes, and ignominiously scourged for asserting their privileges as citizens! The country to which they looked for relief has re∣garded their sufferings with apathy and indifference. Three long, long years we have beheld their whip∣pings and heard their lamentable cries; yet, for three long, long years we have been silent spec∣tators of the disgraceful scene! We have begun a compact with their oppressors, in which these poor dear fellows look with longing eyes in vain for one little tiny article, one ray of hope! <HI>I blush,</HI> that an A—can Minister could be <HI>guilty</HI> of this <HI>disgraceful</HI> omission!</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Peter Porcupine.</HI>—</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman who spoke last, has described the sufferings of our injured fellow citizens in a manner that does infinite honour to his feelings. He talks about <HI>blushing</HI> and <HI>guilty disgraceful omissions</HI> with a warmth peculiar to himself, and admirably calculated to produce what the players call stage effect. Indeed, Sir, I cannot help looking on ourselves as engaged in the perform∣ance of a tragedy here: the gentleman has gone back 2203 years, even to the days of <HI>Euripides,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="030219_0063_0FE5273990206B00"/>
for his model. The piece will certainly do us ho∣nour; but, it seems to be incomplete without a chorus to throw light on some parts of it, that in par∣ticular where he speaks of <HI>blushing;</HI> and, as I have a few verses in my hand, which are not quite foreign to this subject, I beg leave to read them.</P>

<P>True, Sir; nor is it so malicious to fling dirt, as to fling <HI>stones.</HI> I defy any one to say, that I, or any of my <HI>family</HI> or <HI>friends,</HI> ever flung stones, in order to knock out the brains of a man, whose arguments I was afraid to hear, be∣cause I knew them to be irresistible. The treat∣ment of Mr. H—ton is a stain, an everlasting stain on the city of N— Y—k. I do not scruple to say, without disparagement to a crowd of worthily cele∣brated men of whom this country may boast, that, after General Washington, this man has rendered it the most essential services; this very man whom a gang of foreign russian were hired to dispatch. Had one of the missiles hurled from their infamous hands struck him on the temple, you might have had the pleasure of seeing him expire at your feet, while we should have mourned the irreparable loss. Were I to draw your character, Sir, and place it by the side of that of Mr. H—ton; then you would have reason to blush indeed, a die ten thousand times deeper than crimson would become your jaundiced cheek.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. S—</SPEAKER>
<P>The gentleman last up seems to have lost sight of the question altogether. One would think he was contemplating protection to Mr. H— ton instead of A—can seamen. I shall endea∣vour to bring him back to the subject before the committee, reminding him, at the same time, that such personalities as he deals about him are very derogatory of the dignity of this House.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="030219_0065_0FE5267A723DE870"/>I am astonished that proofs of impressments are called for. When we heard of A—can seamen being prisoners <HI>in Algiers,</HI> no evidence was required with respect to numbers. The united exertions of the whole A—can people seemed <HI>to cry out</HI> for their releasement. Let us not be <HI>too nice about evi∣dence.</HI> These men are <HI>ignorant,</HI> and cannot give the necessary information.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter Porcupine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gen∣tleman for his hint about personalities; but he will allow, that I am as excusable as Mr L—, who talked about the <HI>shameful, guilty,</HI> and <HI>disgraceful</HI> conduct of a most upright public Minister. I may not have the mellifluent eloquence of the gentleman last up: I know I am a rough-hewn mortal; but, as I am speaking to men, and not to an assembly of <HI>little misses,</HI> the want of that gentleman's silver lisp may not amount to a total disqualification.</P>
<P>I shall now turn to what the gentleman has ad∣vanced on the subject before us.—He begs us <Q>not to be <HI>too nice</HI> about evidence.</Q> This is going a step beyond the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris. There the <HI>accuser</HI> is heard, and if the jury are sa∣tisfied of the guilt of the prisoner, <HI>no evidence is heard in his defence.</HI> This is not being over nice; but we are required to be still less nice. The mer∣ciful French hear the witnesses <HI>against</HI> the prisoner at any rate; but we are called upon to give our verdict, without hearing any at all; poor unfortu∣nate Great Britain is to be condemned upon the bare indictment. One comes forward and accuses her; she holds up her feeble emaciated hand, and pleads, NOT GUILTY, my Lords. Some of us wish to hear what can be urged against her; but the gentlemen tell us not to be too nice about evi∣dence
<PB N="65" REF="030219_0066_0FE52710432557F8"/>
that she is a notorious offender; that <Q><HI>eve∣ry</HI> man <HI>knows</HI> it, though <HI>no one</HI> can give <HI>regular information</HI> of it,</Q> and, in short, that she ought to have been annihilated long ago. In vain do we, like Pontius Pilate, ask, <HI>for what;</HI> still they cry with one voice: Let her be crucified! Let her be crucified!—And, is it thus we treat our poor old mother in the hour of her distress?</P>
<P>The gentleman produces, as a sufficient reason for our not being <HI>too nice,</HI> the great "<HI>ignorance</HI> of the <HI>citizens</HI> impressed." And, do I hear this lan∣guage from Mr. S—k? Is it possible for the people to be ignorant while under the rays of this focus of science? Do I live, Mr. Chairman, to hear the words <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>citizens</HI> articulated in the same breath? How long, Sir, have our ears been dinned with, <HI>an informed people, an enlighten∣ed people;</HI> with the destruction of superstition and prejudice, and the luminous close of the eighteenth century? And, shall we now be told, that our <HI>citizens</HI> are <HI>ignorant?</HI> That they are such stupid brutes as not to be able to give an account of what has befallen them? not even of their impri∣sonments and their stripes?</P>
<P>But, Mr. S—k, after two or three days dili∣gent search, brings us something like an account of some men impressed from a vessel <HI>of his own,</HI> and this, he insists, is evidence enough for any reason∣able man. Thus, when a sailor can be brought to say, that he has been impressed and scourged, he is an <HI>enlighted citizen;</HI> but when he cannot, he is a poor ignorant devil, <Q>not capable of giving the necessary information.</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman told us something about <HI>Algiers,</HI> and, though I cannot for my soul preceive why

Algiers was dragged into the debate, I look upon myself as entitled to say a word or two in reply. <Q>The united exertions, says he, of the whole A—can people seemed <HI>to cry out</HI> for the re∣leasement of the prisoners in Algiers,</Q> I believe, Sir, that the people in general were much affected with the fate of those unfortunate men, and that, had proper measures been taken to call their feel∣ings into action, the prisoners would long ago have been restored to their families and country, with∣out the interposition of government; but, no one will deny, that these measures should have originat∣ed with the <HI>merchants;</HI> that the example should have been given, and, indeed, the greatest part of the money bestowed by themselves. Was this the case; They did, indeed, <HI>"cry out;"</HI> they might, for ought I know, make fervent applications to heaven; but the applications to their purses, which had been filled by the toil and hardships of these poor fellows, were very faint and ineffectual. A subscription was opened in this city, Mr. S—k was himself one of the receivers, and I now call upon him to say, how much his brethren subscrib∣ed, and how much he subscribed himself. I call upon him to say, whether a company of <HI>foreign players,</HI> yea, even English players, did not subscribe more than all the merchants of this great, rich and flourishing city!—Here was <Q>apathy and indiffer∣ence,</Q> indeed! Here Mr. L— might have seen reason to "<HI>blush</HI> for a <HI>disgraceful omission!</HI>"</P>
<P>I am not sorry that the little gentleman bestowed a few of his silver sounds on the slaves in Algiers, as it furnishes me with an opportunity of comparing the conduct of the friends of the resolution towards those men, and that which they now hold towards seamen impressed by the English. The slaves in Algiers could have been at any time ransomed, and
<PB N="67" REF="030219_0068_0FE5267EB8B5BB10"/>
we well know, that they were <HI>all</HI> real <HI>A—cans.</HI> The seamen impressed are indefinite; we know not who or where they are; all we know about them, is, that they are <HI>all,</HI> or nearly so, subjects of the king of Great Britain. Now, how comes it, that these gentlemen show such amazing zeal, and are so deeply touched with what they gravely call the <HI>sufferings</HI> of these subjects of His Britannic Majesty, while they show such indifference for our own citi∣zens? This seems totally unaccountable, yet, Mr. Chairman, I think I can explain it in a few words. The impressment of <HI>British</HI> seamen by the British forms a subject of opposition to the treaty; any measures taken to resist that impressment may lead to a war; the expence attending the agents sent out will come from the public purse, and not from the purse of these gentlemen. None of these weigh∣ty reasons existed with respect to the slaves in Al∣giers, and therefore, they might have remained there, 'till they had rotted in their chains, had not that government which these sticklers for humanity now accuse of apathy and indifference, been much more vigilant and humane than they.</P>
<P>I have much more to say on this subject, Sir; but as the hour of Turkey and Madeira is at hand, I sit down, in order to give the House an opportu∣nity of adjourning.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NARRATIVE</HI> Of the Suicide of the <HI>Argus</HI> of New York.</HEAD>
<P>OF All the acts arising from folly, wickedness, or de∣spair, that of Suicide is best calculated to awaken curio∣sity. It is so hard to be accounted for from the common evils incident to life, and is such a direct violation of the first law of
<PB N="68" REF="030219_0069_0FE526ECB2F36560"/>
nature, that a man must possess an extraordinary degree of sto∣icism, not to feel some inclination to be informed of the cause. For my part, I felt this inclination so forcibly, upon hearing of the fate of the renowned <HI>Argus,</HI> that I could not rest, 'till I had obtained a circumstantial account of the whole affair. I trust, it is unnecessary to say how my breast has been wrung by this melancholy relation; nevertheless, I should not think that I discharged my duty as <HI>Censor,</HI> did I neglect to impart it to my readers.</P>
<P>By way of preface to this Narrative, it may not be amiss to give some account of the wonderful two-legged creature who is the subject of it.</P>
<P>His name indicates that he has a hundred eyes, which is a real fact. These eyes, like those of the beast in the vision, are divided between his fore and hinder parts; but, in other respects, they resemble those of the Lamper Eel: that is, they emit filth and noxious matter in place of admitting light; or, in other words, they answer none of the useful purposes of this organ in other animals. He is extremely vindictive and fero∣cious, and, though his stupid eyes are too dim to wound in the manner of the bassilisk, yet, when he has no other means of vengeance left, he drops tears that scald and burn like <HI>aqua fortis</HI></P>
<P>These qualities could not fail to recommend him to the great Citizen G—t, of seditious and insolent memory. He very soon became the Citizen's chief favourite, and is supposed to have drank deeply at the fountain of his largesses. From mo∣tives of gratitude, therefore, he was desperately attached to the cause of the French Republic. He has written, sworn, and lied in that cause; and, of all the tools of faction, has, per∣haps, been the most steady to his trust. He has chanted the Marfeillois Hymn, and celebrated all the successful massacres of his benefactors, with that kind of savage joy that animates the ravages of beasts of prey.</P>
<P>But, alas! how transitory are all sublunary things! The disgraceful defeats, or to use their own expression, <Q><HI>the</HI> little success,</Q> of his masters, during the last campaign, plunged him into a state of dejection, from which he was only raised to be sunk over head and ears in despair. Like many other cha∣ritable patriots, he was buoyed up by the hope of a rebellion, or, to give it the fashionable term, of a <HI>revolution,</HI> in Great Britain; and this event was reduced to a certainty by the ac∣count concerning the <HI>Sedition Bills,</HI> which our industrious and faithful and impartial news-mongers spread through the country.</P>
<P>This, then, was the rock of our <HI>Argus's</HI> hope: still, how∣ever, he had his doubts and his fears, and these were left to fluctuate during the wide chasm in our foreign intelligence. No∣thing
<PB N="69" REF="030219_0070_0FE526DBDC9F1E30"/>
torments and harrasses the mind like suspence. The poor <HI>Argus</HI> became pensive and melancholy, was often seen to stop in the middle of the street, and heard to mutter incoherent ex∣pressions about rebellion and <HI>Sedition Bills</HI> and Pitt and King George, or Citizen Guelph, as he called him.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, the fatal 23rd of March, about a quarter after six in the morning, he was perceived, with a spying-glass in his hand, walking on the battery opposite the port. He was observed to stop often and olap the glass to one of his eyes, then scratch his head, clench his fist, and give other evident tokens of anger or madness. At last, turning himself towards the water, he laid the telescope to his shoulder, as if it were a gun, and, after making a motion to fire, uttered a loud cry and ran down to the beach. Two labourers, who had viewed him all this time, now lost fight of him. One of them hasten∣ed to the spot, where he found the poor distracted wretch be∣labouring a log which had been thrown up by the tide. His left hand was all over blood, and the telescope was reduced to splinters, except about four inches of it, which he still gri∣ped fast in his right. Upon being asked what was the matter: "Look," says he, holding his bloody hand to the man, <Q>Look, my lad, that's the heart's blood of Pitt: no pity! no pity! let's to the palace and cut all their throats!</Q></P>
<P>The other workman now came up, and the two together, with the help of a third person, made shift to get him home, without further mischief. This was not effected, however, without some danger; for, as he conceived himself going to Newgate, as a preparative for a voyage to Botany Bay, there is not a mean of annoyance that he did not make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of, or an execration that he did not vomit forth.</P>
<P>When he was put to bed, he swore he was on a rack a million times crueler than that of Damien. <Q>Rascals, says he, I have only killed a minister. I have only done my duty as a citizen and a patriot.</Q> These ravings continued for nearly two hours, after which, having been copiously bled, he dropt off to sleep.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon he waked, when to the joy of his friends, and the surprize of every body, he seemed perfectly restored to his senses. He eat a bason of panada, drank a lit∣tle wine and water, and appeared quite recovered, except from the bruises he had received from the ribs of minister Log.</P>
<P>Just as things were taking this happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one of his printers brought word that a ship was that mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rived from Liver-pool, bringing news to the end of February. This imprudent communication was the cause of an immediate relapse. He jumped up, and, without either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coat, ran down to the wharf, from whence he got o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> board the vessel. "Well,"
<PB N="70" REF="030219_0071_0FE527296ECF90F8"/>
says he, with a voice and look that scared the whole crew, <Q>Well, rascals, you are come at last. Tell me this moment; are the <HI>Bills</HI> passed.</Q>—The Captain answered <HI>yes.</HI> "What!" says the raving <HI>Argus,</HI> "the Bills passed, and no Revolution!" <HI>None,</HI> say the captain.—"What! the English are not cutting one anothers' throats yet!"—<HI>No,</HI> says the humane tarpawling, <HI>more is the pity; but let us hope, for the love of God that they will begin soon.</HI>—This charitable informant had hardly done speaking, when our poor unfortunate friend made an attempt to throw himself over the quarter deck. Being prevented here, he as∣sumed a placid mein, pretended he was only in a joke, though it was evident to every one, he was but too much in earnest. Soon after this he slipped from among the crowd (which was very considerable on account of the great news that was ex∣pected) and got away on the forecastle, where he was prepa∣ing to hang himself. He had even got the cord round his neck, when he was perceived by a man upon the yards. His intentions were now so manifest, that it would have been down∣right inhumanity to neglect him any longer. He was conduct∣ed home by some of the citizens, and put under the care of his own people.</P>
<P>Arrived once more at his home, he seems to have been re∣solved to defer the execution of his desperate design no longer. He dissembled, however; talked very connectedly; enquired whether the paper was nearly composed or not, and even sat down and took his pen under pretence of writing an article of news. By those means he prevailed on his people to leave him alone; two of them, however, thought it prudent to remain at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of the stairs, in order to be at hand, should he make any attempt on his life. Their suspicious were but too well founded; for, at the end of half an hour's dead silence, they heard him utter a most dreadful groan, and, presently after, fall on the floor. They attempted to force the door, but it was too securely fastened. They then applied to the wainscot, and, at last, made an opening, when, shocking to relate! they found their dear master weltering in his blood, his throat being cut nearly across. A surgeon was instantly called, and every assist∣ance given; but, I am sorry to add, that, when this morning's post came away, there was little hope of recovery.</P>
<P>The interval between his entering his appartment and the per∣pretation of the horrid deed, was, it seems, employed in writing a farewell letter to his Sister and only relation, the <HI>Aurora</HI> of Philadelphia. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a copy of this letter, which, if obtained, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> next <HI>Censor.</HI></P>
<P>It is said, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I do not pretend to ascertain, that the instrument with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fatal gash was given, was one of the long <HI>couteaux,</HI> employ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he prisons of Paris, and was a <HI>keep-sake</HI> from a very intimate friend now in France.</P>
