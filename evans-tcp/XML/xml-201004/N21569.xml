<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was commanded to write the Chro∣nology of the World, I was immediately after instructed by Revelation how; without which I could not, nor could any other Man on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace of the Earth with certainty, however eminent for Wisdom and Learning he might be: after it was done, the LORD GOD said to me in a vision at night,—That is the true Age of the World, and the general computed one is erro∣neous.</P>
<P>As the SCRIPTURE is the only great Foun∣tain of Knowledge, or Book of written Truth in the World; as it contains the sacred Records of those Things which GOD has predetermined shall be hereafter—as well as those which have been already; and as it contains the History of our own Creation, with that of every living thing besides, It alone, in preference to any Man's opinion, ought to be, without the least doubt, freely believed and confidently depend∣ed on.</P>
<P>Although I am enabled, from revealed Know∣ledge, to write considerably more than what this Book contains, and which, in Justice to the Divine Spirit of Truth from whom it flows, ought to be believed; yet GOD, who instructs me in all things, that I may shew an example
<PB REF="028354_0006_0FD8A9B62757CED0"/>
of precision to the Learned, and be admired for it by the Wise; that I may give instruction to the Poor, and demonstrate the certainty of what I do write to every Man that has the least knowledge of his Creator, commands me to ad∣ditionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal its Truth by that great Testimo∣ny of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>criptural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vidence which no Nation can deny, and which no human Arguments can op∣pose.</P>
<P>Therefore, having Authority, I proceed thro' the Scripture, regularly uncovering, by reveal∣ed knowledge, as I go, its sacred Records WHICH HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E, holding each one up for public View, beautiful and clear to the open mind, that all Men may behold and examine them, that all men may per∣ceive their Truth and admire, at this late Hour of the World, not only what was wrote by Dan∣iel at Babylon, EXPLAINED IN LONDON, but likewise a similar Communication of RE∣VEALED KNOWLEDGE.</P>

<P>KNOW therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore (meaning the captivity) and to build Jerusalem to Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks, the streets shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.</P>
<P>Seven weeks and threescore and two weeks, is meant for a time of four hundred and eighty-three years: which commenced in the first year of Cyrus over Babylon, when he issued the pro∣clamation to restore the captivity, and conclu∣ded at the birth of Christ.</P>
<P>Two years after the Jews returned from Babylon to Jerusalem they laid the foundation of the second temple, but were so much inter∣rupted in the building, as not to be able to complete it until the expiration of eighty-two years.</P>
<P N="26">26 And after threescore and two weeks (which is four hundred and thirty-four years, meaning from the time the temple was finished to the death of Christ) shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that comes (meaning the Romans) will destroy the city and the sanctuary: it will be done like the overflowing of a flood; and to the end of war their desolation is determined.</P>

<HEAD>THE DEPARTURE OF THE HEBREWS FROM ALL NATIONS, AND THEIR RETURN TO JERUSALEM.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>From the three thousand six hundred and seven∣teenth year of the world, which was the third year of Belshazzar King of Babylon, when the vision was shewn to Daniel, of Jerusalem's fu∣ture desolation, the last dispersion of the Jews, and their being trod under foot in all nations, to the time of their return in the latter days, is two thousand three hundred years.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO make the vision of Daniel, which was explained to me by revelation from the Lord God, to be more easily understood, read what follows:</P>
<P>The prophet Daniel, after describing the suc∣cession of Cyrus and Alexander, goes on to the time of Christ, the destruction of Jerusalem, and how long it is to lie desolate; the dispersion of the Jews, and how long they are to be trod un∣der foot in all nations.</P>

<P N="11">11 Yea, he magnified himself, even to the
<PB N="16" REF="028354_0014_0FD8A9CF10CC8980"/>
Prince of the Host; by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</P>
<P N="12">12 And a host was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en him against the daily sacrifice, by reason of transgression: and it cast down the truth to the ground, and it practised and prospered.</P>
<P N="13">13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and ano∣ther saint said to that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desola∣tion to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</P>
<P>One angel was asking another in the presence of Daniel, that he might hear and be informed to write down what was said.</P>
<P>The sanctuary meant the second temple, tho' not built when this vision was shewn to Daniel; the host, the multitude of the people, or the whole nation.</P>
<P>How long shall be the Vision, means, how long is it from this time or year of shewing the Vision to Daniel until it is fulfilled by the resto∣ration of the Jews in the latter days of the world, when the curse for transgression, which made the city desolate, will be removed, and the ground of the sanctuary cleaned.</P>
<P N="14">14 And he said unto me, to two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctu∣ary be cleaned.</P>
<P>Days are mentioned by the angel instead of years to conceal the meaning of the prophecy until the proper time is fulfilled, and the ap∣pointed person made known for it to be reveal∣ed to: the present is the time that was then intended; I am the appointed person for it to

<HEAD>THE RETURN OF THE JEWS TO THEIR OWN LAND IN THE LATTER TIME OF THE WORLD, RECORDED BY MOSES AND THE OTHER PROPHETS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Song of Moses, in the thirty-second chapter of Deuteronomy, is the written testi∣mony given them, between God as Christ, and his people, until their return to Jerusalem, in the latter days of the world. It begins with describing Christ preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven; afterwards the great de∣struction of the Jews, which was fulfilled by the Romans, and their dispersion over the world: the latter part means their restoration, which invites all nations to rejoice with them for the abundant mercy of God, and his good∣ness to their land.</P>

<HEAD>THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD.</HEAD>
<P>THE very loud and unusual kind of thunder that was heard in the beginning of January, 1791, was the voice of the angel mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of the revelation, pro∣claiming the judgment of God and the fall of Babylon the Great: it was the loudest that e∣ver was heard since man was created, and shook the whole earth every time the angel spoke; it roared through the streets, and made a noise over London like the falling of mountains of stones.</P>
<P>Many buildings were damaged at the time of this thunder, and many persons were frightened by it; the great flashes of lightning proceeded also from the angel, and were according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> verse, reflected from the brightness of his glory.</P>

<HEAD>REVELATION TO ST. JOHN, CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power: and the earth was lightened with his glory.</P>
<P N="2">2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, (meaning the thunder) saying, Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen, &amp;c.</P>

<P N="5">5 For her sins have reached up to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</P>
<P N="6">6 Reward her, even as she rewarded you, and double to her double, according to her works; in the cup which she has filled, fill to her double.</P>
<P N="7">7 How much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her; for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</P>
<P N="8">8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning, and famine, and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judges her.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="vision">
<P>The Lord God was so exceeding angry at the time of the loud thunder I have mentioned in the preceding part, that he determined to leave his other judgments unfulfilled relative to London, and burn her immediately with fire from heaven: soon afterwards I was informed by revelation of what the thunder meant, and was commanded to go from London beyond the distance of eighteen miles. I had <HI>similar to the prophet Daniel at Babylon,</HI> an attending angel to explain all the visions, and support me under the grief I was loaded with for its approaching fall.</P>
<P>The Lord God knowing that I loved him with all my heart, and had often resisted the calls of hunger and distress, rather than comply with customs that would offend him, pitied me; for I had beseeched him to let me inform the people of London of their danger, and try by
<PB N="54" REF="028354_0052_0FD8AA36A50A77B8"/>
all possible means to save them; but was refu∣sed permission, because they would imprison and use me very ill for it.</P>
<P>In addition to all that God had promised and repeated by his angel to make me happy, he was now pleased to give me another proof of his unalterable regard, and convince me by it, that, <HI>although he could not in justice in his recorded judgments spare London,</HI> yet for my sake he would shew mercy to some: and take care, that by sickness and other causes, to remove the persons I desired should be saved, to a sufficient distance beyond the limits to be destroyed and sunk. Af∣ter thanking the Lord God, I mentioned seve∣ral, both men and women, and called the re∣membrance of his mercy to others whose names I did not know, but pointed them out in my mind.</P>
<P>Among those I mentioned, was William Pult∣ney, William Pitt, Gilbert Elliot, Charles Grey, the Earl of Buckinghamshire, the Marquis of Lansdowne, the Earl of Chatham, Maitland, now called Earl of Lauderdale; Henry Phipp, for I remembered his brother to have done me as act of friendship; John Dalrymple, John Griffin Griffin, Alderman Pickett, <HI>because that during his mayoralty he opposed by a public adver∣tisement the frequency of taking oaths;</HI> in doing so be honoured that all-remembering God, who will in due time as publickly honour him for it. Wilberforce, Bastard, Sheridan, Philip Stephens, Charles Fox: John Luke, a poor quaker; Sam∣uel Hood; the King and his family, for they were to be gathered into London: Ponsonby, for whom I conceived an esteem, from observing in his countenance openness and honesty; and
<PB N="55" REF="028354_0053_0FD8AA38DD694818"/>
possessing, as I thought, a heart similar to my own, I was led to entreat for him: until last year I could assign no other reason for mention∣ing that name than what I have given; but the true one is, that as God had determined not on∣ly to keep in London the people then in it, but likewise to allow great multitudes to be drawn to it from all parts of the country, he would be found among the number to be destroyed; for which, to prevent his death in such a place, the Lord God influenced me to regard him, that I might afterwards remember such a person, and be mindful of his safety.</P>
<P>I am not in the least acquainted with the man I have mentioned, whom God was pleased to distinguish by so great a testimony of his regard, but although I am not, and our names are dif∣ferent, <HI>he is, as well as myself,</HI> descended from David, king of Israel. The Countess of Buck∣inghamshire, whom I am no more acquainted with than the stranger I mentioned before, is likewise descended from David, king of Is∣rael; the family she is married into are also of the Hebrews, and are descended from Joseph the once president of Egypt.</P>
<P>There are many families of the same origin as those three I have named, made known to me by revelation, but I am forbid to mention any of them at present for public knowledge.</P>
<P>After entreating for the persons I have set down, and pointing from my mind to numbers besides, whose names I did not know, I was, <HI>to prepare me for the designation of God,</HI> carried up to heaven in a vision, and saw on my right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, at a small distance, a beautiful silver white bird in shape of a Dove, but a little larger; it
<PB N="56" REF="028354_0054_0FD8AA3A454C1440"/>
was the Holy Ghost, and was the very same that descended on the head of my blessed Saviour, when he came up from being baptized in the ri∣ver Jordan; he kept between me and <HI>Satan,</HI> who was then revealed that I might witness it, and great power given him to visit the earth.— The Lord God then spoke to me from the mid∣dle of a white shining cloud.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, <HI>having the angel of God near me,</HI> and saw Satan walking leisurely into London: his face had a smile, but under it his looks were sly, crafty, and deceitful. On the right side of his forehead were seven dark spots; he was dressed in white and scarlet robes.</P>
<P>Again I was in a vision, and saw London a scene of confusion; it was effected on a sudden; all the people were armed and appeared quite furious: I was carried through the city in the Spirit of God to see all things that were design∣ed should come to pass, and be informed how quick they could be accomplished.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and saw a large river run through London coloured with human blood.</P>
<P>Exceedingly unhappy for all that I saw, and which I knew would soon be fulfilled; I pray∣ed and entreated the Lord God to give me one more instance of his mighty regard, <HI>by sparing London and the great multitude in it.</HI> I said, I acknowledge, O Lord my God, that the people do very wrong, but it is through compulsion, and for want of knowing better.</P>
<P>The Lord God was so highly displeased, that I should, after all his former kindness, strain his affection and entreat him to annul his <HI>recorded judgment,</HI> as to stop me, and in a voice of great
<PB N="57" REF="028354_0055_0FD8AA3F6F341F28"/>
sharpness and anger, said, <HI>They have my blessed Gospel, and will not obey it.</HI> The angel that was appointed to give me instruction forsook me in an instant on hearing this answer. I trembled for my life, and seemed to be another man; for I was afraid of being destroyed with the city.— It was three days after this before the Lord God would be reconciled to hear my prayers, and speak to me with his former kindness.</P>
<P>In ten days after the three I was in a vision, and being carried up to heaven, the Lord God spoke to me from the middle of a large white cloud, and said in a strong clear voice—All, All. I pardon London and all the people in it for your sake: There is no other man on earth that could stand before me to ask for so great a thing.</P>
<P><HI>For ever, O Lord my God, I will praise and thank you for this great instance of your blessed regard; all Nations will hear it, and may all Nations honor you by their obedience: your great mercy is over them all, and by its goodness the world is now safe.</HI></P>
<P>Had London been destroyed in the year of 1791, the place where it stands would have formed a great bay, or inlet of the channel: all the land between Windsor and the Downs would have been sunk, including a distance of eighteen miles each side, but considerably more towards the sea coast; it would be sunk to the depth of seventy fathoms, or four hundred and twenty feet, that no traces of the city might be ever found, or even so much as looked for.</P>
<P N="21">21 And almighty angel took up a stone, like a great mill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, and cast it into the sea, say∣ing. Thus with violence shall that great city,

Babylon, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</P>
<P>That all men of wisdom and discernment may understand, on reading the revelation, that there are two cities mentioned in it <HI>spiritually,</HI> under the names of Babylon the Great, I will assist them by clearly marking out the distinction.</P>
<P>Rome, the spiritual Babylon, mentioned in the seventeenth chapter, is described, in the third verse, <HI>to be away into the wilderness;</HI> mean∣ing, by the words, into the wilderness, that the city is situated <HI>inland.</HI></P>
<P>But London, the spiritual Babylon, also men∣tioned in the eighteenth chapter, is described, by St. John, <HI>as the greatest sea-port</HI> for ships, wealth, and commerce, in the world.</P>
<P N="11">11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth her merchandize any more.</P>
<P N="12">12 The merchandize of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyme wood, and all manner of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</P>
<P N="13">13 And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</P>
<P N="14">14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after, are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</P>
<P N="15">15 The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off, for the fear of her torment, weeping, and wailing.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="59" REF="028354_0057_0FD8AA4290F9B400"/>16 And saying, Alas! alas! that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones, and pearls! for in one hour, such great riches is come to nought.</P>
<P N="17">17 And every ship-master, and all the com∣pany in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off.</P>
<P N="18">18 And cried, when they saw the smoke of her burning, What city is like to this great city!</P>
<P N="19">19 And they cast d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas! alas! that great city! wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her cost∣liness; for in one hour is she made desolate.</P>
<P N="20">20 Rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath aven∣ged you on her.</P>
<P>Read attentively the eighteenth chapter; and you will perceive described in it, the prodigious wealth, grandeur, and commerce of London: then remember, that the very great thunder and lightning I have mentioned, was in the depth of winter, <HI>an unusual time of year for the like;</HI> but they were as St. John exactly describes them, in the first and second verses. Meditate on these things, weigh them attentively in your mind, and all I have wrote besides; and the Spirit of God, if you love wisdom, will enlight∣en your understanding to see, and will also strike you with a conviction of their truth.</P>

<HEAD>The following would have been the Condition of England, which the Lord God shewed me in the month of July, <HI>1791,</HI> had his Judgment of Desolation on the World been suddenly fulfilled at the appointed Time in <HI>1793.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I was in a vision, and was carried away by the Spirit of God to a field of young wheat, which was grown about four inches high from the ground: an elderly English woman stood by me; <HI>she had no covering on her head,</HI> but over her arms was an old black silk cloak; it was worn threadbare, and rent in many places. While I was observing the dress and poverty of the woman, the wheat sprung up in an instant, and shot out to the size of full ears, the largest I ever saw in my life: astonished at such a sight, and wondering what it should mean, I stooped to feel some with my hand; when I had, <HI>the woman looked down to me with a countenance ex∣pressive of great distress to implore my pity and assistance,</HI> then turned her face away to the east, and afterwards looked up to heaven, as if she wanted rain and a cool wind.</P>
<P>After this I cast my eyes over the surface of the land; it was scorched to a dark brown, and frightful to look at: I could see no grass in the meadows, and the bushes in the hedges were all burnt brown; <HI>so great and mighty was the heat:</HI> I could see no beasts in the fields, and the fowls of heaven were all flown away.</P>
<P>The judgment of desolation being suspended, is the reason that this vision of famine and dis∣tress is also; when it takes place, England, like the woman and her cloak, <HI>(for she was an

<P>After this I was in a vision, and saw a large sword unsheathed in heaven: soon after I saw a large cup, full of red wine, and much froth on the top, lifted up, and held out to all nations.</P>

<HEAD>THE JUDGMENT OF DESOLATION ON ALL NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE thunder that was heard in the evening of the 2d of August, 1793, was the voice of the angel, mentioned in the nineteenth chapter of the Revelation, standing in the sun.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD>VERSE X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>II.</HEAD>
<P>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, (meaning the thun∣der,) saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God.</P>
<P N="18">18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them; and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</P>
<P>The dead will increase so fast, and be in such prodigious numbers, when this judgment takes place, that the living will not be sufficient to bury them, but will leave the bodies exposed to the fowls of heaven for meat.</P>
<P>The flashes of lightning, which issued during
<PB N="62" REF="028354_0060_0FD8AA49381D8A20"/>
the thunder, proceeded from the glory of the angel proclaiming the judgment of God, and re∣sembled in colour the clear day light.</P>
<P>The <HI>second thunder,</HI> that gave notice of God's approaching judgment, was on Wednesday eve∣ning, the 7th of August 1793, <HI>as is mentioned in the seventh of the Revelation,</HI> and was the voice of the angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD>VERSE II.</HEAD>
<P N="2">2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice <HI>(the thunder)</HI> to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea;</P>
<P N="3">3 Saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</P>
<P>The flashes of lightning, which issued during the time of this thunder, proceeded likewise from the glory of the angel, and resembled in colour fine amber.</P>
<P>The next and last thunder, <HI>(if the judgment had not been suspended for my sake)</HI> would be on the 11th of August following, and would have been, according to the sixteenth chapter of Re∣velation, the fourth angel pouring out his vial on the sun.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD>VERSE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>And the fourth angel poured out his vial on the sun, and power was given him to scorch men with fire.</P>

<PB N="63" REF="028354_0061_0FD8AA4AC4A29988"/>
over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.</P>
<P>The flashes of lightning, during this thunder, which would continue many hours, would like∣wise proceed from the glory of the angel, and would be, in strength and colour, like the burn∣ing flame.</P>
<P>This thunder would be accompanied by a vi∣olent storm of large hail stones, which, with the lightning, would kill multitudes of people, and destroy the harvest in many countries.</P>
<P>Soon after this thunder, <HI>the short time of four days only,</HI> the judgment of God on the world would begin to be fulfilled. The winds would be suspended in the firmament, <HI>according to the seventh chapter,</HI> that breathing might almost cease; the great body of heat, that would im∣mediately after be poured down from heaven on the earth, <HI>would be so fierce and powerful as to move the world, and kill every living thing, both man and beast, exposed under it in the open air.</HI></P>
<P>The trees, bushes in the hedges, grass in the meadows, and what corn was left from the hail, would be cut off and destroyed by this great and mighty heat. Most of the ships would be destroyed at sea, and all the fish near the sur∣face killed. Millions of the human race would die in all nations from this burning heat, and the many plagues it would produce.</P>
<P>The Nineteenth, Seventh, Sixteenth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth chapters, mean the same time, the same things; and are as one chapter to fulfil the judgment of God.</P>
<P>The 15th of August 1793, was the time ap∣pointed by the Lord God to fulfil the parts of the Revelation I have mentioned, and punish
<PB N="64" REF="028354_0062_0FD8AA4C37E5B528"/>
the world with desolation; but from his great mercy and regard for me, that I may be esteem∣ed in this country, and by all others, when I am revealed, suspended his judgment for a time— it hangs however over all nations.</P>
<P>Look at the age of the world; read atten∣tively the chapters I have mentioned, with what I have wrote besides; and you will discover in your own breast a light, to see and believe by.</P>
<P>That <HI>light, I mean</HI> which is often called <HI>a cer∣tain something,</HI> an <HI>internal monitor,</HI> that applauds man for courting wisdom, for being just, and doing good; but that never fails to reproach him for embracing folly, and doing evil: it is indeed no other than the Spirit of the living God.</P>
<P>All the prophecies given in visions from God, are concealed from the knowledge of man by mysterious allusions, until the proper time, and the appointed person for them to be reveal∣ed to. For it is not in the cunning of any one man, even assisted by the wisdom of all the rest on earth, to search out the deep secrets of God, or with truth to unfold the meaning of his vi∣sions: <HI>they are wonderful;</HI> they cannot be disco∣vered until God himself pleases to remove the co∣vering of secrecy; and, through an appointed person, blesses the world with a knowledge of their true meaning.</P>
<P>The fulfilling of the judgments of God, how∣ever destructively they may prove to the govern∣ments and nations which they are directed a∣gainst, are not allowed to affect my personal safety, nor operate in the least to my prejudice: for the certainty of my elevation, to the greatest <HI>principality</HI> that ever will be, in the world, can∣not
<PB N="65" REF="028354_0063_0FD8AA5071AB9768"/>
be prevented by the rise or fall of any hu∣man power on earth; because it is the repeated covenant of God to my forefathers, and his sa∣cred promise now by Revelation to myself.</P>
<P>The obscurity of David was no objection, with a discerning God, to make him the mo∣narch of Israel, and afterwards promise the succession to his family forever; neither is mine now to his fulfilling that promise, and holding me up to the world, as the visible governor of the Jews. For all the works of God are won∣derful, and very far exceed the capacity of man to know where they begin, how they are direc∣ted, on whom, or which way they will end:— I that have more knowledge of them, and of fu∣turity, revealed to me, than any other under the whole heaven, observe the operation of ev∣ery new one with more amazement than the former.</P>
<P>Therefore my present poverty is no obstacle to my future elevation, neither is it of much concern to myself; for the time of my being re∣vealed, with power from heaven, is nigh; when God, to manifest his regard, will give me favor with many, and influence all the people of Lon∣don to help me.</P>
<P>I am the prophet that will be revealed to the Jews, to order their departure from all nations, to go to the land of Israel, their own country, in a similar manner to Moses in Egypt, but with additional power.</P>
<P>I was an officer in the English navy, and ne∣cessarily so, although I did not know it, that the judgment of God on David, king of Israel might be fulfilled, which was, that the sword should never depart from his house.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="028354_0064_0FD8AA534F449990"/>It is fifteen hundred years since my family was separated from the Jews, and lost all knowledge of its origin; the last on record, in the Scripture, is James: xiii. chap. 55 ver. of St. Matthew. Told me by revelation.</P>

<P>A knowledge of the Scripture, the prophecies I have mentioned, and all that I have wrote be∣sides, have been communicated to me through visions and revelations from the Lord God: the prophet Daniel, and St. John the Apostle, were instructed, in the same manner, to write what they have.</P>
<P>It is by the saving of multitudes; by reveal∣ing, not only a true interpretation of the pro∣phecies, but also a knowledge of the times, and those secret parts of the Scripture which are not made known to any other man under heaven, that the Lord God begins with announcing to the world a knowledge of his mighty judg∣ments, <HI>the return of his former mercy to the He∣brews,</HI> their speedy restoration to Jerusalem, and the rise of a favorite family.</P>

<HEAD>REVELATION TO ST. JOHN, CHAP. XVII. OF ROME.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 AND there came one of the seven angels, which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come hither, and I will shew thee the judgment of the great whore, (meaning Rome) that sits upon many waters, (meaning her government over many nations.)</P>
<P N="2">2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, (meaning, they have been seduced to imitate her evil practices,) and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication, (mean∣ing, they are likewise deluded to drink deep to a state of insensibility from her vain doctrines.)</P>
<P>A remarkable instance of this was very late∣ly practised, and really fulfilled at Naples;— which, although governed by a king, is not∣withstanding in the see of Rome, and about sixty miles distant. In consequence of a vio∣lent irruption of fire out of mount Vesuvius, which is but a few miles from Naples, the simi∣litude of a human head, called St. Janarius's, was carried in procession, lifted up, and held out, fully believing, that by honoring the saint, through even this small part of his image, he himself in heaven, would be influenced to inter∣cede with God, to stop the great rivers of fire which issued from the burning mountain.</P>
<P>For a people, calling themselves Christians, which have had the Revelation so long to warn, and the blessed Gospel so long to instruct them, to embrace at this late hour of the world, such

But it is a part of that great chain of errors, still continued, which the Roman go∣vernment, at a former period, most wickedly bound its people in all nations, but clergy in particular with; and which is plainly foretold by St. Paul, in the fourth chapter of his First Epistle to Timothy, verse 1.

<P>The papal authority does not allow its cler∣gy to marry, from a belief that a man, by liv∣ing in a state of separation from a woman, is better qualified to fulfil the duties of a priest, more acceptable to God, than a man that is a husband and father. Such doctrine is an evi∣dent proof to every discerning person, that there is a great departure, or falling away, from the true faith; to continue then in the practice, after it is explained and made public by Divine command, is preferring darkness to light, the doctrines of devils to the good words of God: it is giving a willing heed to the se∣ducing spirits that St. Paul alludes to. Christ, the Savior of the world, who left his gospel of the kingdom of peace for the direction of all men, never made any such distinction; for some of his apostles were married, and some were not: and be, as God the Father, in the begin∣ning of the creation, blessed Adam and Eve, saying to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and
<PB N="70" REF="028354_0068_0FD8AA5CC76441F8"/>
replenish the earth, &amp;c. repeating the same after the flood, to Noah and his sons: he never or∣dered, nor never intended, the cruel imposition of celibacy on his immediate servants, or any other description of men.</P>
<P>It is also an abomination to him, because in∣consistent with the design of his creation, that any description of women, under the vain pre∣tence of what is falsely called religion and pi∣ety, of leading a more holy life, of serving God better, should be shut up forever in monasteries, inhumanly deprived of becoming wives and mothers.</P>
<P>I am commanded to say, it is grievous and sorrowful to the Lord God to see nations, which acknowledge him, and which have the whole Scripture to inform them of his will, paying a blind, an idolatrous obedience to human ordi∣nances, supported by bad oaths, and sinful vows, in direct opposition to what he designs, and what in the beginning, the covenant of his blessing prescribes.</P>

in her hand full of abominations, and filthiness of her fornication.</P>
<P N="5">5 And upon her forehead was a name writ∣ten, Mystery—Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots (meaning that she as a mother stood exposed for corrupting with her evil doctrines many cities to the condition of harlots) and abominations of the earth.</P>
<P N="6">6 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus; and when I saw her, I wondered, greatly astonished.</P>
<P>This Babylon the Great, this mother of har∣lots, means Rome; but is spiritually called by those names as an allusion to her excess of guilt as a Babylon, and corruption of doctrine as a mother.</P>
<P>St. John mentions in the third verse, that he was carried away into the Wilderness to see Rome; meaning by the words <HI>into the Wilder∣ness,</HI> that Rome the city he goes to look at is sit∣uated inland: this description is given to make a distinction between it and London, the mari∣time Babylon, full of ships, seamen, and com∣merce, mentioned in the eighteenth chapter.</P>
<P>The scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, with seven heads and ten horns, means the Pope—in this chapter only, and not in any other part of the Revelation, is the Pope alluded to under any name—or under any signi∣fication whatever: neither is Rome but in one part, which is in the sixteenth chapter and mid∣dle of the nineteenth verse.</P>
<P>The Pope, in addition to his many names of blasphemy, likewise assumes the powers and prerogatives of God, calling himself▪ Instead of
<PB N="72" REF="028354_0070_0FD8AA636C0082D8"/>
his blessed Savior, the Supreme Head of the Church: as such he pretends, for it is only pretention to deceive the ignorant, to be in∣fallible, and to pardon the commission of sin in others: again, as if sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and commanded immediately from God to impart freely his mighty blessing and his mighty spirit to whom he pleases, he ordains as it is called, Bishops, laying hands on them, and saying at the same time, receive the Holy Ghost; he likewise claims the pre-eminence of holiness in his person, and obedience to Christ in his actions, above all the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>There is no man spiritual that is not sancti∣fied by the Holy Ghost, and no man is sanctified that teaches by his doctrines—or recommends by his prayers opposition to Christ the Saviour, and disobedience to his Gospel of Peace; for it is through and by Christ the blessed spirit, is given that sanctifies, which every man that believes in him, and obeys his commands, may have— may partake of its blessing and sweets; some more, some less, in all things, and for all oc∣casions, as the Lord himself judges proper; but it will be given to every man in such suffi∣ciency as to make him abundant in knowledge, and teaching him clearly the ways of Salvation.</P>
<P>Man may give to man a title, but it is God only that can make man spiritual; it is he and none else that can give the Holy Ghost, the Di∣vine Spirit of Truth; all other givers among mankind, who say, "by the imposition of our hands receive the Holy Ghost, whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven, and whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained;" are but as
<PB N="73" REF="028354_0071_0FD8AA65068309B8"/>
so many false Christs—vain pretenders—blas∣phemously endeavouring to imitate the true One.</P>
<P>For a man to attempt to do what the true Christ only can, is attempting an imposition, and justly constitutes a false Christ. For a man to kneel down to a man to receive the Holy Ghost and then going forth by the authority of this false Christ; teaching and preaching under the name of the true Christ, but in opposition to his commands; deluded by an opinion that he is Spiritual because his human maker imposed on him to believe so, when in reality he is not, constitutes a false Prophet.</P>
<P>Those are the kind of people that the Lord Jesus Christ alludes to in the 24th chapter of St. Matthew, and warns the world to beware of.</P>
<P>There are many that preach and write under the name of Christ, without being influenced by his Spirit, or commanded by his word: for which, observe all you that love him, that read this book, that he will not give his blessed Spi∣rit, which is indeed the Holy Ghost, to any man exalted in pride and living under names of blasphemy; praying for the success and ag∣grandizement of particular men in war, at the expence of ruin, and destruction to others.— And yet, the Pope, to impress the multitude round him with reverence and awe, is entitled Holiness, the Vicar of Christ, Successor to St. Peter, and is accounted infallible; all such names are an evident demonstration of pride and falsehood; and as such, he has neither ho∣liness from Christ in his person, nor obedience to the Gospel of Truth in his actions.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="028354_0072_0FD8AA688757AF38"/>It is for blasphemy, idolatry, deceit, teaching rebellion against Christ, and for being a shedder of blood by war, that the Pope is called in the Revelation from God, a scarlet colored beast; under that dreadful name, though knelt to as divine, and exalted to the height of Heaven by titles, <HI>he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nks down into perdition;</HI> he is a fallen man, and is adjudged by that already testimony of St. John, to suffer the punishment of ever∣lasting fire.</P>

<P>The Popes having rose to what they are, and established their power by the sword, is the reason that God mentions in this part of the revelation to St. John, the beast; or papal au∣thority, to ascend from the bottomless pit: in the beginning they were great military princes, and governed with large armies; but latterly their power became weak, and their conse∣quence small; yet notwithstanding, the vain titles, pageantry, and military parade, are still preserved and closely embraced by the present.</P>

<P N="9">9 And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</P>
<P>The woman means Rome; and the seven mountains or hills on which the city is built, are meant by St. John as the seven heads of the Pope.</P>
<P N="10">10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes he must continue a short space.</P>
<P>These seven kings mean seven powerful mili∣tary Popes: they are denominated kings be∣cause they were warlike men, and in other re∣spects governed with the sword like them.</P>
<P N="11">11 And the beast, that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, is the same as the seven, and goes into perdition.</P>
<P>This means the last military Pope of Rome; for as the Popedom has rose by the sword, by the sword also it will fall; and the last Pope
<PB N="76" REF="028354_0074_0FD8AA6D2BD80F60"/>
alluded to in this verse, as well as the first mili∣tary one alluded to in the eighth verse; goes into perdition.</P>
<P N="12">12 And the ten horns which thou saw, are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</P>
<P N="13">13. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength to the beast.</P>
<P>These two verses mean the cardinals, who are compared to kings in name; but not in power: they are great, but not independent; they have a great name, but not independent sovereignty: they are called, like the German electors to the Emperor, as is mentioned in the seventh chapter of Daniel, the horns of the beast; because they assist the Pope with their counsel and authority.</P>
<P N="14">14 These shall make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb shall conquer them; for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful.</P>
<P>The pope and cardinals, by their teaching, practice, and government, are in a state of op∣position to Christ; that is, they practise and encourage, to support their form of govern∣ment, Swearing and War; the two principal things which Christ, above all others, prohibits in the most positive terms. It is for this oppo∣sition to his commands in the Gospel, that they are represented as making war against him;— they are permitted, through the patient suffer∣ing of God, to do so, until he can bear no longer with their rebellion; when, to fulfil this prophecy and his decreed judgment, they
<PB N="77" REF="028354_0075_0FD8AA721F85BB90"/>
will be entirely cut off. Christ, as supreme head of the church, acknowledges no religion but what he has taught by his Gospel, which is Christianity; for there is no kind of church but one, and that is visible man: it consists of one person, as well as a whole congregation; of one just man in a room, as well as a million any where else; he came into the world to save sinners, and redeem them from the chains of eternal death: the blessed Gospel is the great bond of his promises, now put into the hands of all men that will receive it for their instruc∣tion; for which, all that read or hear it, ought to remember their solemn covenant in baptism, and take care that on their part, the terms of his salvation are complied with. To do which, man must, to fulfil the design of his creation, endeavor to live long, and live happy; to do that, he must abolish War, and live in constant peace; he must likewise abolish swearing of every kind, because it leads to falsehood and perjury: and make the innocent words of Yes or No, the solemn bond of his public truth.</P>
<P>The men that are called preachers of Christi∣anity, instead of assuming vain titles and lofty political names; instead of assisting in any way at councils of state, they ought to stand between princes and war, between men and strife, be∣tween nations and bloodshed: they should be true teachers of the Gospel, and, like the im∣mediate disciples of their blessed Savior, always the Ministers of Peace.</P>

These two evils, enforced by law, and encouraged by religion, under the time of Christianity, and in contradiction to the blessed Gospel of truth, are the two principal fountains that deluge the world with sin, and deprive heaven of many.</P>

<P>As circumcision to the Jews was the seal of their covenant with God, and promise of obe∣dience to his law, so is baptism with Christians the seal of their covenant with Christ, and pro∣mise of obedience to his commands.</P>
<P>When teachers, professing Christianity, have their maintenance and elevation in the world, dependent on great political warlike govern∣ments, and want to do, from interested motives, what the blessed Gospel prohibits, to add plau∣sibility to their delusive reasons, as in the legal and religious case of swearing oaths: they go back to the law of Moses for a precedent, to justify their apostacy and conduct. The law was for the Jews alone, under the appointed administration of the Levites and elders, in their own country; nevertheless, when stran∣gers acknowledged God, and submitted to its rites, they were also allowed the freedom of its benefit; but when Christ came into the world, for the redemption of man, he abolished the law, which was temporary, and in its place gave the Gospel; which is everlasting. That is, he removed the form of worshipping God by sacrifice; the form of coming at the truth by
<PB N="82" REF="028354_0080_0FD8AA7CF98042B8"/>
swearing; and that of obtaining justice for injury, by reprisal and violence.</P>
<P>We all admire the Lord Jesus Christ for his humility and affection, the goodness and wisdom that breathes throughout his Gospel, and the sacrifice of himself for our salvation; yet the generality of the world, as if unmind∣ful of this wonderful instance of Divine love, not only refuse what they promised in baptism to obey, but likewise seek, by opposition and war, to destroy his salvation and happy govern∣ment of peace. What does a man require from his wife in marriage, but to love and be faith∣ful to him only? Would he not be jealous, and very angry, if she obeyed any commands in opposition to his, and honored another with the endearing name of husband? By the same rule, all that are baptized, are, by covenant, comparatively married to Christ; for the name of Christian implies a belief in him, and an obe∣dience to his words. Is it wise or just then, to obey a doctrine contrary to the commands of thy blessed Lord and acknowledged Savior? And is it not unkind in thee, O man, to honor thy equal with his sacred name?</P>
<P>As a man cannot, in justice, be considered as a servant, any longer than while he obeys the commands of his master, so neither can a man, in truth, be regarded as a Christian, any longer than while he obeys the commands of Christ.</P>
<P>Hear therefore, all nations, what the Lord God commands me to write, and be warned by it; that, as a master is compelled to withdraw his allowance of food, and discharge from his house a servant that will not obey him, so will he withdraw his loving kindness of peace, and
<PB N="83" REF="028354_0081_0FD8AA81951C3C60"/>

<HEAD><HI>PREFACE</HI> TO BOOK THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>LENGTH of time, change of countries and governments, corruption of language, and hasty copies in writing, before the more exact method of printing became generally used, has been the means of not only introducing, with∣out design, into the Hebrew Bible, an insertion of some new words, but likewise an expulsion of some of the old, which produces a disagree∣ment in some few parts, and makes it differ now from what it originally was in the times of David, Solomon, and at the commencement of the Babylonian captivity: some parts of the English translation are, consequently, erroneous; but they are so immaterial as not to affect, in the least, the truth of its sacred <HI>Records,</HI> or the tendency of its divine instruction.</P>
<P>The few parts of the English translation, which I am instructed to alter in my writings, the propriety will be allowed by every person that has discernment to perceive, or conviction
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="028354_0085_0FD8AA8D63197170"/>
to believe:—beyond the limits of my author∣ity, for it is prescribed, I am not suffered to proceed in any word or in any way whatever.</P>
<P>The following are the words which the Lord God spoke to me in a vision, soon after I was commanded to write and make known his judg∣ments, for the good of London and general benent of all nations:—There is no other man under the whole heaven that I discover the errors of the bible to, and reveal a knowledge how to correct them, so that they may be restored as they were in the beginning, but yourself.</P>
<P>Moreover, when I began to write I believed it necessary to adopt the same language as the Scripture does, regularly imitating it in the words—ye thee, and thou; but God spoke to me in a vision of the night, and said—Write in the same manner as I always speak to you; write as other men do; write according to the custom of the country you live in; you will then be better attended to, and what you write will be more easily understood.</P>
<P>A man that has been an officer in the navy, whose immediate ancestors have been separated from the Jews such a considerable length of time as to make them forget they ever belonged to the name,— such a man declaring himself openly to the world a prophet of God, the re∣vealed Prince allotted to order the sudden re∣turn of the Hebrews from all nations, and gov∣ern them in the land of Israel, will, with some reason, I allow, excite both astonishment and doubt: but from the multiplied recorded testi∣monies I produce, which no other on earth can,
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="028354_0086_0FD8AA8E432F4AD8"/>
it ought not to prevail with any person as a just objection against believing what I write.</P>
<P>For observe, some hostile profession was ne∣cessary for me to be engaged in, to fulfil the recorded judgment on the family I am designed to represent in the seat of government; there∣fore, with all the certain proofs I have and will constantly bring forward▪ with all the just rea∣sons I advance, the surprize and doubt, enter∣tained at the beginning, ought to vanish in as little time as would be requisite to read again the book which contains the account.</P>
<P>But remember likewise, from the records of Scripture, that Moses was taken away in his infancy, and remained separated from his bre∣thren for eighty years; the first forty of which he was reared in the palace of the king of Egypt, and educated in the language and cus∣toms of the country like one of its own native princes; yet he was revealed to the Israelites as the prophet of God, to order their hasty de∣parture from Pharaoh's bondage, and after∣wards to conduct them to the Promised Land.</P>
<P>SAUL, the son of Kish, after being anointed king, prophecied in company with other men, to the great astonishment of all that saw him.</P>
<P>DAVID, king of Israel, the greatest favorite that ever God had on earth, whose wars th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' many, originated at that time from necessity and justice, never undertook, but to prevent the introduction of idolatry, and preserve in the land of Israel a true uninterrupted worship of God, was a prophet; and for whose sake, in remembrance of his name, besieging armies were destroyed, and Jerusalem safely delivered▪
<PB N="xc" REF="028354_0087_0FD8AA915A61D860"/>
Yet this great monarch this unequalled favorite, this pattern of mercy to all kings, and who alone, of all men under heaven, possessed the established promise of everlasting national gov∣ernment, could not, (but the objection did not proceed from any charge of injustice or sin,) for, being a man of war, and having shed much blood on the earth, although done by the ex∣press concurrence of the Most High, be per∣mitted to build at Jerusalem a temple of worship for him: The great honor was given to Solo∣mon a king of peace, his son and immediate successor so averse though necessitated to or∣der it was the Creator of the world to the effusion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blood and the destruction of man.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>PROPHECY</HI> which relates to the present Time of the <HI>WORLD,</HI> the present <HI>WAR,</HI> and the approaching <HI>DISTRESS</HI> of all <HI>NATIONS. THE PROPHET DANIEL, CHAP. VII.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the first year of Belshazzar, king of Ba∣bylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions in the night on his bed; then he wrote the visions, to shew the substance of what they contained.</P>
<P N="2">2 Daniel spake and said; I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heaven strove on the great sea.</P>
<P N="3">3 And <HI>four great beasts</HI> came up from the sea, different one from another.</P>
<P N="4">4 The first was like a lion, and it had eagle's wings: I beheld 'till the wings were plucked, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</P>
<P>The lion means George the Third, the pre∣sent king of England; plucking the wings of the lion, means taking away the power of the king, made stand on the feet as a man, with a man's heart, means his reduction to the con∣dition of other men,—and possessing similar thoughts.</P>
<P>It is more than twenty months since I first wrote to the king, queen, and minister of state, to inform them of many things that would come to pass; that the time was nearly accom∣plished for some of the judgments of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be made manifest, and also that this prophecy was fulfilling: I beseeched them in the most earnest and respectful language, not to join in the war
<PB N="95" REF="028354_0092_0FD8AA9FCD2B6620"/>
on any account whatever, or even encourage it, for the death of Louis the Sixteenth would be impossible to prevent, it was recorded, and could not be avoided; the revolution in France, and its consequences proceeded entirely from the judgment of God to fulfil this prophecy of Daniel: therefore all attempts to overthrow the judgment, and preserve the monarchy by force, was opposing what was determined in the Scripture of Truth should most certainly take place.</P>
<P>The aspect of the war was delusive, the en∣couragements of success that it held out to prin∣ces were deceitful; but those encouragements of delusion were permitted, to bring many na∣tions under the judgment of God, and punish them for the heavy guilt of opposing his decrees.</P>
<P>If many had no more to fight against than a few men alone, or nations but one divi∣ded nation to subdue, then it might with reason be expected that the greatest number would soon overcome the least, and that many strong nations would soon conquer a weak one: but it is many men fighting against the Spirit of God, and strong nations laboring in vain with their blood and treasure to overthrow his Judgment.</P>
<P>The Lord God permits this opposition for three years and a half, to fulfil the determined part of this prophecy on all that oppose it;— that done, his judgments will take place, to punish man and lay waste kingdoms.</P>
<P>St. John the Apostle, in the nineteenth chap∣ter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Revelation, alludes, to the present time of the world, and means the same things, though differently described, as the prophet
<PB N="96" REF="028354_0093_0FD8AAA1AD16ADC8"/>
Daniel does in the seventh chapter; for which I am commanded to insert a part, that all prin∣ces and governments may be publicly warned, that they may know the consequences of this war, from the judgment of God, will be— death to millions, and everlasting distress to all nations.</P>
<P N="10">10 And I fell at his feet to worship him, and he said to me, see thou do it not; I am thy fel∣low servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; worship God: for the testi∣mony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P N="11">11 And I saw heaven opened; and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</P>
<P N="12">12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself.</P>
<P N="13">13 And he was cloathed with a vesture dip∣ped in blood: and his name is called, The Word of God:</P>
<P N="14">14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, cloathed in fine linen, white and clean.</P>
<P>The armies are an allusion to the powerful judgments of God, under what—or how many different forms their visitation of death is made on the world.</P>
<P N="15">15 And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he will rule them with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</P>
<P N="16">16 And he has on his vesture and on his thigh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="97" REF="028354_0094_0FD8AAA5DA82F108"/>17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, (meaning thun∣der, which is explained in the first book of Re∣vealed Knowledge) saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God.</P>
<P N="18">18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that fit on them; and the flesh of all men both free and bond, both small and great.</P>
<P N="19">19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together, to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</P>
<P N="20">20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had re∣ceived the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</P>
<P N="21">21 And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</P>

<HEAD>DANIEL, CHAP. VII. CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P N="5">5 And, behold, another beast; a second, like a bear: and it raised itself up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</P>
<P>This verse means the present empress of Rus∣sia: She is according to the judgment of God in this prophecy, decreed to suffer death: and by
<PB N="98" REF="028354_0095_0FD8AAA6F22F0008"/>
revelation I am informed it will be done by the hands of man.</P>
<P N="6">6 After this I beheld, and so, another like a leopard: which had on its back four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads, and do∣minion was given to it.</P>
<P>The Leopard, means Louis the Sixteenth king of France: the wings of a fowl on its back, are, like the eagle's on the lion, an allusion to the king's great moveable power.</P>
<P>The fall of this monarch from a throne, and afterwards suffering death, to fulfil the judg∣ment of God by his prophet Daniel, was impos∣sible for all the armies of Europe to prevent; equally so as the decreed death of Charles the First, king of England, which is mentioned by St. John in the thirteenth chapter and third verse of the Revelation; <HI>the deadly wound being healed,</HI> in the same verse, means the <HI>recovery</HI> of monarchy <HI>by the restoration</HI> of Charles the Second.</P>
<P N="7">7 After this I saw in the night visions a fourth beast; and behold, it was dreadful, and terrible and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped on the residue (meaning the elec∣tors) with its feet; it was different from all the beasts that were seen before, and it had ten horns.</P>
<P>This great beast, so different from the others, means the present emperor of Germany; the ten horns, mean the electors, or princes of the empire.</P>
<P>In one part of this chapter the horns are de∣nominated kings; the reason is, they raise ar∣mies, go to war, and govern with absolute
<PB N="99" REF="028354_0096_0FD8AAA8838D4958"/>
power, like them; but notwithstanding, they all acknowledge the emperor as their chief, and under that acknowledgment of subjection are so∣lentaly engaged to defend his empire when cal∣led on. For which to conceal the meaning of the prophecy, until the fulness of time comes and the appointed person for it to be revealed to, the vision represents the German princes as horns of defence belonging to the emperor's head.</P>
<P>It devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped on the residue with its feet—means the entire destruction of the German electors; and tho possession of their territories by the emperor: he will destroy them, and also spread his do∣minion over Italy; threatening at the same time all Europe, and despising its kings with their feeble efforts to oppose him. Rome will fall under his power, and so will Venice likewise; the former will be retaken by the French re∣public, but the latter will be plundered and al∣most destroyed. After this, to fulfil the pro∣phecy and the judgment of God, he will suffer death from the hands of man.</P>
<P>The orders of the emperor, in the Nether∣lands, are, that if the Austrian army should be defeated, <HI>and it most surely will;</HI> for I am com∣manded to repeat, as an example and warning, what the prophet Jeremiah was commanded to say to the messengers of Zedekiah, king of Judah:</P>

<P N="9">9 Thus says the Lord; Deceive not your∣selves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely de∣part from us: for they shall not depart.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="100" REF="028354_0097_0FD8A8BA605A8438"/>10 For though he had smitten the whole army of the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men, yet they should rise up, every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</P>
<P>By the same example, if the French army was to be defeated, even again and again, it should recover and conquer likewise; (that all the judgments of God, in the seventh chapter of the prophecy of Daniel, may take their course, and be fulfilled,) to acknowledge the French repub∣lic, and make an immediate peace on the best terms that can be obtained, the interests of o∣ther nations will not be much consulted: time, the threats of a victorious enemy, and the peri∣lous condition of the German army, will not admit the least delay.</P>
<P>The English will sharply remonstrate against this conduct; for which their army, however incredible it may appear to the Government now, will be surrounded, disarmed, and com∣manded to depart: but their General will be detained by the Austrian; and by revelation from the Lord God to me, he falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The emperor, being exhausted of money by the war, but having a large army at his com∣mand, determines, now he has made peace with the French, and quarrelled with the En∣glish, to execute the plan he has for some time conceived the hopes of being one day able to accomplish—his father and uncle, strange as it may appear, yet it is most certainly true, for I am informed by revelation, conceived the same design, and believed the attempt easily practi∣cable when the opportunity offered, which is—
<PB N="101" REF="028354_0098_0FD8A8BBB7B644A0"/>
<HI>the reduction of all Germany, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vernment of himself.</HI></P>
<P>He begins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seizing on the electorate of Hanover, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dering it quite bare: after this success, his ambition for more extensive dominion will rise; it will now lead him boldly forward to subject and devour them all. For God, to fulfil his judgments, and this prophecy of Daniel, in chapter vii. will deliver him over, to be governed by the secret, but powerful workings of an evil spirit; because his inclina∣tions are bad: according to all that I informed the king and queen of, in May and June 1792: as he did Ahab, king of Israel, to accomplish his fall, and the entire destruction of his family.</P>

<P N="6">6 Then the king of Israel gathered the pro∣phets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? and they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</P>
<P N="7">7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might en∣quire of him?</P>
<P N="8">8 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat▪
<PB N="102" REF="028354_0099_0FD8A8BD50F22280"/>
There is one man yet, Micaiah, the son of I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him, for he does not prophecy good of me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</P>
<P N="11">11 And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made horns of iron; and he said, Thus says the Lord, with these thou shalt push the Syrians, until thou continue them.</P>
<P N="12">12 And all the prophets prophecied so, say∣ing, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper:— for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.</P>
<P N="13">13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah, spake to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets are as one mouth, declar∣ing good to the king: let thy word, I pray thee be like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e word of one of them, and speak that which is good also.</P>
<P N="14">14 And Micaiah said, As the Lord lives, what the Lord says to me, that will I speak:</P>
<P N="17">17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep which have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace▪</P>
<P N="18">18 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecy no good for me, but evil?</P>
<P N="19">19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> right hand and on his left.</P>
<P N="20">20 And the Lord said, who will persuade Ahab, that he may go up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fall at Ramoth Gilead▪ and one said in this manner, and ano∣ther said in that manner.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood before the Lord, and said I will per∣suade him.</P>
<P N="22">22 And the Lord said to him, In what man∣ner? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and pre∣vail also; Go forth, and do so.</P>
<P N="23">23 Now, therefore, behold, the Lord God has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord has spoken of evil concerning thee.</P>
<P>The Emperor's council will be filled with the same delusive evil spirit, that they may con∣cur with him, and possess the same violent in∣clination for war and human destruction as him∣self. At this time a fresh decree will be issued from Vienna, commanding all Germany, and all the people under his government, as he con∣quers them by fire and sword, to offer solemn prayers up to the Lord God, for the further success of his imperial majesty's arms, the entire destruction of his enemies, and the preservation of himself; styling him, <HI>in blasphemy against God,</HI> their most Gracious, Just, and Merciful So∣vereign Lord.</P>
<P>The other nations of Europe, afraid, and trembling, will as solemnly implore the same Lord God for peace and safety, against such a cruel enemy, forgetting, that it was but a lit∣tle time before, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere praying in the same strain of blasphemy as himself—<HI>To destroy their enemies, and give success to their arms;</HI> to that very gracious and compassionate God, who seal∣ed the redemption of man with his own blood, and strictly commanded all nations, as his chil∣dren

<P>Opposition is in vain; he goes through the principalities like a flood, and collects in his progress a mighty army. The course of the prophecy is, That he shall conquer and destroy all before him: therefore he certainly will;— and take away the treasure of many wealthy cities likewise.</P>
<P>After this, to finish oppression, and fulfil the decreed judgment of God, the French Republic will be raised against him; his army will be entirely overthrown in Italy, and himself will be compelled to seek shelter among the very people whose relations he destroyed, whose towns he plundered and burnt but a little time before. This is Francis, the present reigning emperor of Germany, who is described, in chap. vii. ver. 7. of the prophecy of Daniel, as great, strong, and terrible; stamping under his feet with contempt, and destroying all the princes round him. His ambition will increase with his dominion, and his conquest will be so wonderful, for a short time, as to make all Eu∣rope tremble; his end is miserable; and as he treated others without mercy, no mercy will be shewn to him. His death, by the hands of man is certain, because decreed; and his punishment everlasting, because recorded. To be related to him now, will be considered hereafter as a capital crime.</P>

up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</P>
<P>This little horn, that grows great, and be∣comes so ambitious as to pluck up three of the other horns, to extend his own dominion, is the present King of Prussia. He is one of the imperial electors, and to fulfil exactly what the visions of God describe him to be, he confi∣dently calls himself, in great words, The pre∣ponderating member of the Germanic body.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia will acknowledge the French republic, and also make peace with it: he will oppose the Emperor, and likewise fol∣low his example; by which his dominions, to fulfil the prophecy, will be enlarged (compara∣tively for a moment only) by the addition of three electorates, when the Bear, (meaning Russia,) watching for the opportunity, <HI>will rise</HI> and devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prussia at one side, while the Em∣peror destroys him at the other.

<P>Russia will assist the Emperor in the begin∣ning, to promote her favourite design of de∣stroying the Turkish empire; she will also quar∣rel with the Poles and devour great numbers of them; Warsaw will be set on fire▪ and the government entirely changed.

treading down, and devouring with great fury, all opposition in its way. At the capital it stops; here are its decreed bounds; no far∣ther it must go. Here the Russian general di∣vides the spoils of many cities with his army, and the rich provinces of Turkey between his officers. Here he despises the oath of fidel∣ity, and throws away the submission of a sub∣ject—proclaiming himself Emperor of Greece.</P>
<P>After this the Swede will enter Russia, and destroy with great fury; even the ships of war and capital will not escape. The Russian em∣pire will be convulsed in many parts by its gen∣erals and governors, each rising up in his place, and claiming an authority to command the oth∣er: they will fight until great multitudes are destroyed, and the country made desolate. The imperial family will all be cut off, and no suc∣cessor will for ever after arise: the Govern∣ment, at the same time, will be broke to pie∣ces, and utterly dissolved; never, never to be restored any more.</P>
<P>The Spanish Monarchy will cease by this war, and the Stad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holdership of Holland will be cut off close to the ground; according to the visions of God to me, in 1792, and which I communicated at that time by his sacred com∣mand to the king and queen of England.</P>
<P>The king of Sardinia will be dethroned, and the Popedom destroyed forever! according to the revelation of God to use, and which I com∣municated to the English prime minister before the war with France was entered into; conclu∣ding what I wrote to him with these words— It is not all the navy of England, nor the ar∣mies

of Europe united, can prevent the king of Sardinia from being dethroned.</P>
<P>The <HI>death of the French king,</HI> as one of the particular number, mentioned in the seventh chapter of Daniel, decreed to die, took place, to fulfil the pre-determined judgment of God by this prophet; the monarchy of France is like∣wise, by the same judgment, abolished for ever, and the present form of government established. Therefore marvel no more that it cannot be conquered by all the armies without, nor de∣stroyed by all the commotions within; if it could, by human power, the <HI>Horn</HI> (meaning the king of Prussia) would be the allotted man to accomplish it: for the meaning of the pro∣phecy is, that he shall prevail against France for three years and a half, but not to conquer the whole: he would have faithfully kept with his army in France the promises he made with his mouth on entering it; which were to deli∣ver over the towns for plunder, and the peo∣ple for death, if he was opposed. it is for this that he is described by Daniel, to have a <HI>mouth speaking great things and blasphemies.</HI> All this would have been permitted, because recorded, to fulfil the prophecy; to hasten his own de∣struction, and the general fall of <HI>European Monarchy.</HI></P>

<P>HEAR what the Lord God additionally says to me by revelation, and commands me to write—<HI>France</HI> seeing England left alone, de∣serted by all her allies, will require, as the conditions of peace, an acknowledgment of the republic, a restoration of the colonies, and the ships taken away from Toulon. For a short time he will permit <HI>England,</HI> as he will <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> to succeed in the acquisition of delusive conquest, but it is the better—the more effectual, and more imperceptible to human foresight, to accomplish his judgment on her, according to the prophecy of Daniel and Reve∣lation of St. John; after that short time is expi∣red, which is nearly sorrow, new enemies will rise up, some warring against her openly, others privately; all will prevail, until she that sirs now as a <HI>queen among the nations,</HI> is, according to the vision of God, in my first book, without a covering on her head, worn thread-bare, and rent in many places.</P>
<P>Will England continue this war any longer against a people that have the judgment of God in their favor? Will she, by a continuance of the present war against France, enter into ano∣ther, for the safety of Hanover, against the Emperor of Germany, who will be rendered invincible for a time as a <HI>scourge,</HI> to fulfil the recorded judgments of God? Will she continue this war any longer for her destruction that she may enter into a fresh one with America to

hasten it? Is the king of England so regardless of his own life, and the preservation of his fa∣mily, as to involve them with himself in certain misery and death, by a longer continuance of this war: Is the government, the parliament, the clergy and people, so insensible to the bles∣sings of peace, and the happiness of fortune, as to prefer the absolute certainty of losing all they possess, and being destroyed themselves, to support a war which, in its consequences, to fulfil the judgment of God, is designed shall throw down, for ever, the English monarchy; and from the confusion it will make, through∣out the country, involve almost every family of wealth in beggary and death?</P>
<P>Are you, William Pitt, to whom I wrote in May and June 1792, informing you of the con∣sequences of this war to your country, when the war was not intended, so insensible to your own preservation and the benefit of your bro∣ther, as to continue any longer a war that will involve both you and him in certain death?— What I acquainted you with in 1792, and often since, was made known to me by <HI>visions and revelations</HI> from the Lord God. The <HI>death of Louis</HI> XVI. and the removal of the English crown from the king's head, to a level with the ground, according to the seventh chapter of Daniel; the fall of the queen's palace, and the destruction of the Tower; your own removal from administration, and afterwards death, was among the things which I informed you of would most certainly come to pass as the evil consequences of this delusive war. My account to you then, of futurity, concluded with these
<PB N="110" REF="028354_0107_0FD8A8D76793CA48"/>
words—"The visions are established, and the things mentioned most certain and true."</P>
<P>When I informed you that England would enter into this war, and the consequences which would, in despite of all your efforts, flow from it, <HI>you despised me;</HI> for at that time, the war was not intended: and to tell of evils that would most certainly ensue from a thing, when the thing they were to proceed from was not designed, were to you the effects of folly and deceit.</P>
<P>My knowledge of future things is given me from God; therefore what I wrote was true: A little time longer, and England will be so much entangled as not to be able to go forward without feeling the pains of that <HI>colonial conquest</HI> which is to be the cause of her death; nor to retire, without falling under that foreign blow, which will break the empires in pieces, and throw herself down on the ground; from whence she is never to rise up any more.</P>
<P>Neither evil can be prevented, and both will take place, to fulfil the <HI>judgment of God,</HI> accor∣ding to the prophecy of Daniel and Revelation of St. John; <HI>unless what I write is believed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> true, and the advice I give is strictly followed.</HI>— Fleets and armies are great things to talk of, because terrible to destroy mankind; but, when opposed by the power of heaven, they become weak, they lose their force and terror: for most of those in Europe are destined for the rocks and the flames: They are permitted to conquer a little for a short time now; but it is, like Russia and Germany, to hasten that dreadful f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of human government which will soon take place in the world: for they ever have been, in the
<PB N="111" REF="028354_0108_0FD8A8D9A6ACC5A8"/>
hand of God, the very instruments to effect what princes designed to prevent.</P>
<P>On the 12th of the month called May, 1792, I wrote to the king, minister of state, and spea∣ker of the commons, that no person should be able to say, hereafter, my conduct was irregu∣lar, or in the least disrespectful, to inform them that I was commanded, by the Lord God, to go to the Parliament-house on the 17th follow∣ing, and acquaint the members, for their own personal safety, and the general benefit of the country—That the time of the world was come to fulfil the seventh chapter of the prophecy of Daniel, and some of the judgments of God in the Revelation; that the death of Louis XVI. and the revolution in France, for the perpetual destruction of its monarchy, was decreed in the Scripture of truth; and would, against all hu∣man opposition, most surely take place: To in∣form them that the war, just going to be com∣menced, by Prussia and Austria, against France, was the very war alluded to by St. John, in the Revelation, chap. xix. which God called a war against himself;—because it went to oppose his decrees, and because it would be an effort of kings to overthrow his unaltera∣ble judgment. I was commanded to advise them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>minister of state,</HI> not to join in the war, or even encourage it on any account whatever: To inform them of the ap∣proaching fall of monarchy in Europe, the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this war would be productive of to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, but particularly to those that enga∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and likewise to inform them of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the jaws of the earth by a

pre-determined earthquake, according to the judgment of God, in chap. xvi. ver. 16, 17, 18, 19, of the Revelation; and lastly, to intreat them to acknowledge this gracious communica∣tion from God, for their length of life and bles∣sing, by an obedience to his good advice.</P>
<P>When at the door, on the 17th, I informed the speaker by a letter, that I waited, and was ready to communicate all that I was comman∣ded. In a few minutes after a messenger return∣ed, with my own letter, who treated me, <HI>in such a public place particularly,</HI> with unfeeling con∣tempt and incivility. The Lord God spoke to me instantly, on being ordered to go about my business, and said—Get away, get away from this place; be under no concern, it was not you that was despised and ordered away, but me, in your person, that sent you.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home I was in a <HI>vision</HI> and saw a large measuring rod move through the streets in great haste, and strike many of the houses as it passed, marking them for their ap∣proaching fall. After this I was made to look towards the <HI>Treasury,</HI> while the Lord God pro∣nounced, at the same time—<HI>All that side shall fall.</HI> In an instant, the whole place was cover∣ed with thick darkness; it seemed to be everlas∣ting darkness; darkness that should never be removed: And, again, he pronounced, in quick words, as if displeased—The whole shall fall.</P>
<P>The information, as will be plainly seen by the date, which I gave to the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>minister of state,</HI> with what I was commanded to offer to the parliament, was not only before the pre∣sent war with France was entered into, but also some length of time before it was ever intended:
<PB N="113" REF="028354_0110_0FD8A8DFA42B56A0"/>
therefore no person can say, with justice, that ei∣ther my conduct in obeying the positive com∣mands of God, or my endeavours to preserve peace; to preserve this country from the many evils it has now to encounter with, according to the determined judgment of unerring pro∣phecy; originated from weak ideas or political motives. No, my knowledge is given from God; I see all things now as they truly are; and know their consequences, to change them to what they really will be hereafter.</P>
<P>I am commanded to keep no company, and live retired; that I may avoid the temptation of political discussion, or any other argument, that would create animosity and strife.</P>

<P>The <HI>two witnesses,</HI> the <HI>two olive trees,</HI> and the <HI>two candlesticks,</HI> mean the same two parts of the <HI>everlasting Gospel of Salvation,</HI> as they are wrote by St. Matthew and St. John; which are the <HI>two apostles</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> witnesses of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="028354_0111_0FD8A8E52531D1F0"/>This explanation alone, which has never been discovered to any before, is sufficient to strike every man with conviction, that studies the Scripture, and believes in the spirit of God, that, as this part is true, the others I have, and shall constantly mention, are equally so; and that a knowledge of the whole comes directly to me from the Divine Being.</P>
<P>As the eyes of the blind cannot be opened, nor the sick healed, but by the immediate pow∣er of God; so neither can the prophecies be truly explained, but by regular instruction from the same <HI>Almighty Being.</HI></P>
<P>Read diligently what follows, and by the information contemplate on the mighty good∣ness of God, for revealing a true knowledge of his prophecies in sufficient time to implore for mercy, and save a <HI>city</HI> with <HI>multitudes of people,</HI> recorded to be destroyed.</P>
<P N="7">7 And when they shall have finished their tes∣timony, the beast that ascends out of the bot∣tomless pit will make war against them, and will overcome them, and kill them.</P>
<P N="8">8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which is spiritually called So∣dom in Egypt, where also our Lord was cru∣cified.</P>
<P>This great city, mentioned here, means <HI>Lon∣don:</HI> her streets are full of prostitutes, and ma∣ny of her houses are full of <HI>crimes.</HI> It is fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such exceeding great wickedness, that St. john <HI>spiritually</HI> calls <HI>London,</HI> in this chapter, by the name of <HI>Sodom;</HI> and infers, from the toleration of so much evil, that the two witnesses of Christ, that the two apostles, St. Matthew and St. John, spiritually represented by the two parts

<P N="11">11 And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell on all that saw them.</P>
<P>The three days and a half, <HI>mean three years and a half;</HI> and the present is the time of the world alluded to by St. John: for until the present war, of <HI>time, times,</HI> and the <HI>dividing of time,</HI> which is three years and a half, according to Daniel, 7th chapter, also is expired, the two parts of the blessed Gospel will lie dead in London, and over Europe likewise: after which, a <HI>prophet, (my∣sery)</HI> will be revealed to the world, with signs and the mighty power of fire from God; the two parts of the gospel of salvation will then be revived. <HI>(For my designation is, and the commands of God to me are, that I shall walk through the great thorough-fare-street of the city, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-pronounce his judgments, and declare them irre∣vocable.

<P N="13">13 And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand, and the remainder were a frighted, and gave glory (meaning honour) to the God of heaven.</P>
<P>The <HI>recorded judgment</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> according to this last verse, is that London, for indeed it is the city meant shall be visited by an earthquake, and a tenth part of it destroyed; in that tenth part, about seven thousand persons will be kil∣led. When the people see this, they will be convinced that it proceeds from the great anger of God, for despising his offered mercy, and creating his messenger ill, then they will all be frightened, and will all believe: Then the city will honour him by instant reformation, and all the people will implore him for pity.</P>
<P>Lot was laughed at, and the danger despised by his sons-in law when he said to them. "Up, get you out of this place, for the Lord will de∣stroy this city." Sodom was burnt and they perished.</P>

<P><HI>The thirteenth verse</HI> means the proclamation issued out by the king and council, to assemble for the last time the English parliament; they are to meet, but are never to separate, that all things in this prophecy relative to them may be fulfilled; and in the allotted time will, accord∣ing to the judgment of God, be destroyed by an earthquake.</P>
<P>Reader, consider attentively what I write, and remember that sin is always committed by man through the temptation of Satan, (for there is no man on earth that does not do wrong at times, neither is there my that is not a sinner; look at the words of Solomon in his prayer when the Temple was dedicated.)

<P>Them, means the <HI>Parliament; Armageddon,</HI> their house to assemble and die in.</P>
<P>Armageddon was a valley to bury the dead in and also a place of great mourning near Je∣rusalem:—The Parliament House in London being the <HI>recorded prophecied</HI> burying place of its members, and multitudes besides, is, for its designed similarity to the former, spiritually called in the Hebrew tongue by the same name.</P>
<P N="17">17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial in the air; and there came a great voice (meaning loud thunder) out of the Temple of heaven, from the Throne, saying—"IT IS DONE."</P>
<P>This verse means, that when the allotted time is expired for the English parliament to exist, the Lord God will pronounce from the Throne of Heaven, in a voice of very loud thunder, the judgment of its utter destruction on a sudden.</P>
<P N="18">18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake and so great.</P>
<P>The judgment of God being to destroy the English Parliament, this mighty earthquake will swallow it up at the very time of its sit∣ting, and likewise so much of London, as to leave but three divisions of it standing.</P>

<P>The city mentioned here, under the name of the great city, means London; this <HI>designed re∣corded earthquake</HI> will be felt in all nations under heaven as well as in England, and he dreadful effects by most cities in the world as well as London. The earth will be shook so violently at this time as to make it sink in many places, and let the sea flow in where the land was: mountains will sink to a level with val∣lies, and many islands will disappear forever in the sea.

<P N="14">14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</P>
<P N="15">15 I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions I saw troubled me.</P>
<P N="16">16 I came near to one of them that stood by, <HI>(an angel,)</HI> and asked him the meaning of all these things; so he told me, and made me un∣derstand the interpretation of them.</P>
<P>The prophet Daniel, in his visions, as well as St. John the apostle in the Revelation, had al∣ways an attending angel near, to explain the meaning of every thing he saw that was neces∣sary for him to be informed of.</P>
<P N="17">17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</P>
<P N="18">18 But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</P>
<P>The time is very nearly come for the <HI>judg∣ments of God to be felt in all nations,</HI> and this pare of the prophecy to be fulfilled in Europe: It is a warning to all princes and states, to honor God, and fear his judgments; to live in peace, and govern with mercy.</P>
<P N="19">19 Then I asked him the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, and exceeding dreadful! whose teeth
<PB N="126" REF="028354_0123_0FD8A906A4FADBA0"/>
were of iron, and its nails of brass; which de∣voured, broke in pieces, and stamped on the residue with its feet.</P>
<P N="20">20 And of the ten horns that were in its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and of the other which came up, before whom three fell; even of that horn which had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</P>
<P>The beginning of this verse means the Ger∣man Princes; the rest of it the King of Prussia; he threatens and executes more, presuming on the unconquerable power of his army, than any of his equals. His being represented in the visions of God as a horn, with eyes, and a mouth speaking very great things is an allusion to his military strength, quick discernment, and violent inclination to quarrel, always disputing for territory,—pushing at or fighting against some nation or other.</P>
<P N="21">21 I beheld and the same horn made war on the saints, and prevailed against them.</P>
<P>For my entreaty, the Lord God has been pleased to suspend this part of the prophecy, the latter part of the twenty-first verse that of allowing the king of Prussia to prevail against the righteous, and govern them with great op∣pression, under the power of his army, for three years and a half.</P>
<P N="22">22 Until the Ancient of Days came, when judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints should possess the kingdom.</P>
<P>2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thus he said;—The fourth beast will be the fourth kingdom on earth. (The Emperor will reduce, under his subjection, all Germany, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neighboring states, and all Italy, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="127" REF="028354_0124_0FD8A908665B61B8"/>
this great kingdom,) which will be different from all the other kingdoms; (meaning the other great kingdoms or monarchies, shewn in the vision; which are, England, Russia, and France.) It will try to devour the whole earth, tread it down, and break it in pieces.</P>
<P N="24">24 And the ten horns, out of his kingdom, (meaning the German electors, before they are destroyed by the Emperor,) are ten kings which will arise; and another will arise after them, meaning the king of Prussia, who is an elector: he will be different from the first, and will subdue three kings.</P>
<P>When the king of Prussia opposes the Empe∣ror, he will also at the same tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> follow his ex∣ample, which will soon now begin to manifest itself; indeed, the interval of time between this and then is but short; for all things are hast∣ening fast, and concurring in their operations, extend the war, and give the prophecy its full recorded course.</P>
<P N="25">25 And he will speak great words against the Most High, and will wear out the saint of the Most High; and will think to change times and laws: and they will be given into his hand, for a time, and times, and the dividing of time.</P>
<P>The beginning of this verse means the king of Prussia, speaking in <HI>blasphemy</HI> against God, threatening in great words, as if he possessed the whole power of heaven, to conquer and destroy, with his army, all cities that do not open to him and all men that oppose his designs. This was exactly fulfilled by the Horn, when he entered France in 1792; the proclamations which he issued, at that time, are full of <HI>blas∣phemy</HI> against God, presumption for his great
<PB N="128" REF="028354_0125_0FD8A90F2EB92E80"/>
army, and violent threats to destroy cities, and out innocent men in pieces.</P>
<P>Change times and laws: the meaning of which is, that what God decrees is his law, and this prophecy contains it; an opposition by the <HI>king of Prussia</HI> to what God has decreed shall come to pass, is endeavoring by force of arms to stop the course of the prophecy, and change the decreed time for it to be fulfilled. The king of Prussia, by threatening, with the great strength of his army, to build up, what God, to fulfil this prophecy, has thrown down; to re∣store that monarchy in France, which God, to fulfil his recorded judgment in this prophecy, has removed for ever;—is the meaning of— <HI>And he will think to change times and laws.</HI></P>
<P>And they will be given into his hand, for a time and times, and the dividing of time. The meaning of which is, that the king of Prussia, although acting in opposition to the will of God, (for every man that reads the Scripture, and believes it to be the book of truth, possesses from that moment a knowledge of good and evil, of right and wrong, of what is merciful, and what is cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, of what is pleasing to God, and what is offensive,) is permitted to wage a war of injustice against the righteous for three years and a half; during which time, according to the prophecy, he would conquer and destroy great multitudes of them. But my prayers pre∣vailed with God, even against his own recorded judgment by Daniel, for I beseeched him to op∣pose the unjust designs of the king of Prussia, before he invaded France, after he had, to suspend the prophecy, and for my sake to turn him back. The Lord God spoke to me in a vi∣sion,
<PB N="129" REF="028354_0126_0FD8A910656DAA40"/>
at night, and said, "He shall go out of France with shame and confusion."</P>
<P>This promise was fulfilled in the year 1792; for, soon after the Prussian army entered France, God led it into such difficult places as to endan∣ger its safety; he also sent the visitation of a wasting sickness that forced it to go away, ashamed and highly disappointed. Although the other parts of the prophecy must necessarily be fulfilled to accomplish the purposes of God, and the destruction of the Prussian monarchy, the king cannot conquer as the judgment in∣tended but he is permitted to oppose, sometimes defeated with shame, and sometimes encouraged by deceitful success; until his armies become weak, and the Bear becomes strong; until the proper time arrives for him likewise to fall.</P>
<P N="26">26 But the judgment shall sit, (it ought to be, <HI>But the judgment shall take places</HI>) and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia will have his country destroyed by <HI>fire and sword:</HI> his power will be taken away, and also his life: the government will be changed, and the monarchy will be abolished for ever.</P>
<P>In the year 1792 I sent the commands of God, as they were given to me by revelation at night, to the king of England, for the king of Prussia, before he invaded France, desiring him to return home, and have nothing to do with the people of that country; for the change of government taking place among them was de∣termined, that the unalterable judgment of God, in the Scripture of Truth might be fulfilled: reminding him, at the same time, as a corro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rating
<PB N="130" REF="028354_0127_0FD8A9162F264060"/>
testimony, that what I wrote was from God, of the monitor that entered his breast, and so powerfully struggled with his inclination to keep him back from war, that when he posi∣tively resolved on it, reproached him strongly with the injustice.</P>
<P>That intelligent, internal monitor, was in truth no other than the compassionate Spirit of the living God, striving, to the last moment, to save a falling man from the dreadful effects of his own judgment: but the king of Prussia de∣spised the blessed intimation, and resolved on a war; which, if there was no knowledge of God in the world, no part of human reason could find the least colorable pretence to justify.</P>
<P>At the time of my writing to the king of England, relative to the king of Prussia, I in∣formed him, as I was commanded, of the certain failure of the combined armies of Prussia and Austria.</P>
<P N="27">27 And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness, (meaning the power of all the king∣doms under the whole heaven,) will be given to the people and saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all do∣minions mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> serve and obey him.</P>
<P>This is that real kingdom of heaven, of Christianity in practice, to believe and obey God, which was commanded by Christ, to pre∣serve the soul of man, and a due knowledge of himself; preached by the apostles, and through them the foundation of it laid in all nations; though determined from the first transgression of Adam, and began more than seventeen hun∣dred years ago, with all the materials ready prepared, from the multiplied interruptions of
<PB N="131" REF="028354_0128_0FD8A91726C6A6A8"/>
war and other causes, incident to human king∣doms, like the second temple at Jerusalem—long in building—This mighty structure is not fin∣ished yet. This is that stone, cut out without hands, mentioned by the prophet Daniel, in his second chapter, 34th and 35th verses, which breaks the head and the feet, the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, and the clay, of the great image of human power to pieces: and this is that kingdom, mentioned by the same prophet, in the 44th verse following, which is to break in pieces and consume all other king∣doms; but which is to remain itself forever.— The name of this universal kingdom is Peace; it has the blessed Gospel for its government, and the Lord God for its king.</P>
<P>As I knew, in the beginning of 1792, that the king of England would enter into this war, and by doing so, fall under the same judgment from God as the other monarchs shewn in the vision, unless I could, by a just explanation of the prophecies, persuade him to remain at peace; he will, I trust, with the queen and minister of state, do me the justice hereafter to acknow∣ledge that the danger was fully communicated: and that I did not cease in my endeavors to pre∣vent him from joining in the confederacy against France, not only for a long time before he in∣tended it, but also after he had, even till the designs of government were ready to be execu∣ted by open preparations for hostility.</P>
<P>If this war was like any which has preceded it, a prince might, as usual, sit down at his lei∣sure, and calculate, from his successes, how long to carry it on; or, by his defeats, how soon he must leave it off: but the death of Louis XVI.
<PB N="132" REF="028354_0129_0FD8A9191A5A9500"/>
and the revolution in France, having proceeded from the recorded judgment of God, the two <HI>things which have occasioned it, and which have rendered it so entirely different, that its consequen∣ces are already determined,</HI> will be the lame to the monarchs engaged in it, as it happens to a man unexpectedly caught in a large trap, on forbidden ground—the pains of death convince him of transgression, before his eyes could warn him of the danger.</P>
<P>I know the judgments of God; by them I am directed; by revelation and through his Holy Spirit I write. To fulfil, then, the seventh chapter of Daniel, and such parts of the Reve∣lation as mean the present time and the same things, the war now carrying on will involve all the nations engaged in it in great distress, and nearly all the princes of Europe in death. As I knew all this a considerable time before the war, I set my heart and my mind to intercede with God, although it was against his recorded Judgments, to save the king, and <HI>spare the coun∣try</HI> I live in: I succeeded with God, and ob∣tained an offer of mercy; but could not with man, to believe and accept it.</P>
<P>I wish well to the king and queen, and like∣wise their family, to know all that I have re∣lated, and more than I am permitted to tell; to know the unavoidable death of him, and after∣wards the certain destruction of an amiable woman and her children, would, I thought, be a crime to reproach for ever the feelings of my heart, if I did not implore, when I knew the great kindness that God had for me, and endea∣vor, by all the means in my power, to pre∣vent it.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="028354_0130_0FD8A91A275D1278"/>But in doing this, I have subjected myself to the power of human laws, when, indeed, I had the choice to make them subject to me; for if I had not become an intercessor, by prayer and supplication for the people I live among, I should have been sent away from London. Its fall would soon after take place; and then my revelation, as the next great thing to warn the world, would immediately succeed; but, pre∣ferring its safety to my own immediate advan∣tage, <HI>although informed at the time that the people would not believe; that I should be despised, and made to suffer;</HI> I obtained its pardon at the risque of my own life, and determined to re∣main in it until my time to be revealed was en∣tirely completed.</P>
<P>I find, yes, I feel by dreadful experience, that all men are insensible to the consequences of those judgments, recorded in the Scripture, and are also exceedingly hardened against believing their true interpretation and time to be fulfilled. That I have suffered, by imprisonment and dis∣tress, more than is proper now to publish, <HI>for entreating, when I was told that my entreaties were contrary to the prophecies,</HI> to save the king and his family; London and its inhabitants, from recorded destruction; God, who is more gene∣rous to give mercy, than man is grateful to be∣lieve and accept it, is by all this revealed know∣ledge of his prophecies my witness now, and will, in due time, in a short time, be addition∣ally so, by terrible signs and mighty wonders.</P>
<P>I have said, in the first book, that the fulfil∣ling of the judgments of God, however de∣structive they might prove to the nations or governments, which they are directed against,
<PB N="134" REF="028354_0131_0FD8A91F25F66A10"/>
would not affect my personal safety, nor operate in the least to my prejudice: my elevation is recorded in the Scripture, and established by promise to myself; besides, I am not mortal to human power. But although I am to be great, <HI>far abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any prince on earth,</HI> and cannot be de∣stroyed by man: although the fall of govern∣ments and ruin of nations, will not be allowed to affect my personal safety, nor operate in the least to my prejudice, I will not provoke any, but endeavor, by a peaceable conduct, civility, and fair words, to make all men believe.</P>
<P>My earnest desire and prayer to God is, that as he has given me a pre-eminence of favor to all men that were ever upon earth before, I may be able, <HI>although I have been in prison, insulted and dispised; although my zeal is broke, and my inclination altered,</HI> to save in this country one person as well as another; the king, as well as myself; the rich, as well as the poor; all with∣out distinction. For which I request all men to meditate on the present times, and consult with themselves by their knowledge of the Scripture, by comparing the leading features of what ru∣ined other great nations unexpectedly, to what are now as suddenly opening to human view, and what are as unexpectedly coming to pass in the world; of the judgments and prophecies to be fulfilled, which every man that has the spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conviction to believe, and an understanding to discern, must plainly perceive that the con∣vulsed state of Europe, as it now presents itself, is one of their visible features; and that the sudden great war which occasions it, <HI>Multi∣plying still as it lengthens against all forcible en∣deavors, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>icing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> expected, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing

<P N="1">1 And in that day, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</P>
<P>The man alluded to by the prophet is myself, and the time of the world is <HI>just now come.</HI> Re∣member that the seventh chapter of Daniel, and the sixth of the Revelation, are now fulfil∣ling; remember, likewise, the second chapter and 24th verse of Haggai; by all of which, thrones are to fall, nation to be turned against nation, army against army, and man against man, until the earth is wasted of her people.— By this great destruction of the human race, millions, millions of women will go to the grave, widows, unmarried and barren.</P>
<P>The war is now, <HI>compared to what it will be in future</HI>—as four or five houses on fire, is to a large city set in flames by them; which all the arts and invention of the world, which all the force of power and political foresight cannot quench.

represents so many women as taking hold of one conspicuous and particular man.</P>
<P N="2">2 In that day the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth will be excellent and comely for them which are escaped of Israel.</P>
<P N="3">3 And it shall come to pass, that he which is left in Zion, and he that remains in Jerusalem, shall be called Holy: even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem.</P>
<P N="4">4 When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and has purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.</P>
<P>This verse alludes to the Jews after their re∣storation, and to Jerusalem in the latter time of the world, when rebuilt and inhabited; the Jews will then acknowledge Christ for their Messiah, and through the sanctification of his blessed Spirit they will be cleaned from sin.</P>
<P N="5">5 And the Lord will create upon every dwel∣ling-place of mount Zion, and upon her assem∣blies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glo∣ry (meaning the people) shall be a defence.</P>

be concealed until this time of the world, which is the time they relate to: its seals, their spir∣itual look or fastening.</P>
<P>Observe, the Revelation was given to St. John a long time after the death of Christ, not to commemorate those things which were before, which were fulfilled, which were known before the time of writing it; but to record those things which are to be in future, and which are to be fulfilled: according to the words of God, declared in the fourth chapter, and first verse, which are, "Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be <HI>hereafter.</HI>" They were shewn to him in heaven, under such won∣derful, such incomprehensible similitudes, in vi∣sions, as to seal their meaning a perfect secret, until the time of the world alluded to came, when the designed spiritual person (for no man can be a prophet of Christ, now under Christi∣anity, and speaking through the Holy Ghost, his spirit, without bearing some similarity to himself in meekness and compassion▪ (witness the apostles) would be revealed, to open the spiritual seals, and make known the secret pro∣phecies under them in the book.</P>

<P>The four first seals are opened, and the co∣vering of secrecy is removed; the judgments which are to punish the world for transgression, by rising nation against nation, and man against man, are gone forth <HI>spiritually under the simili∣tudes expressed in this chapter, to the eighth verse,</HI> and are began to be fulfilled; the concealed meaning of the prophecies, which have been carefully preserved so for me untill the present

<P>The Lord God commands me to acknowledge the kindness of a poor woman, that brought me a three-penny loaf each week, every Monday morning, when I was in prison: Her name is Isabella Wake. The prison is Newgate.</P>
<P>A man that died the day before, of a bad fe∣ver, and from neglect, for the want of proper nourishment, as I was told, made a vacancy in a room, with fourteen poor men, little air, and much crouded, for me to come into his place.</P>
<P>The small, very small pennyworth of bread, with water only, except one day in the week, when there are a few ounces of beef, for twen∣ty-four hours, is barely sufficient to keep life and body together. The prison is very close; there is not room enough to promote health, by the necessary exercise of walking: there are no coals allowed for fire, nor candles for light. There is no bed to lie on, nor blanket to cover one: The poor are entirely desti∣tute here.</P>
<P>When the condition of prisons, and the treat∣ment of prisoners, is required for public inform∣ation, it is from the poor man, whose health is injured by confinement, who has to draw his little air through a small iron-barred window, who has but a small pennyworth of bread al∣lowed
<PB N="144" REF="028354_0141_0FD8A938E3D3C890"/>
for the whole day to live on, that a true account is to be received; but certainly not from the officers, keepers, and contractors, who live in plenty; whose emoluments swell in pro∣portion as the prisons grow crouded.</P>
<P>Therefore be no longer astonished that London, in one part of the Revelation is called under the name of the great city, <HI>for she is the greatest city in Europe, and the richest in the world;</HI> in anoth∣er part she is called Sodom; and in a third, she is, as well as Rome, <HI>spiritually called</HI> Babylon the Great.</P>
<P>No man, who has any knowledge of God, can justly say, that London is without guilt, and her people are without sin; when her streets are full of vice, and her prisons are full of oppression.</P>

<P>I am commanded to acknowledge likewise the acts of friendship I received from Captain Hanchett, of Abingdon-street, which the Lord God considers as shewn directly to himself; therefore his blessing is on you; and by his pro∣mise in the Gospel, your reward is great.— Moreover, I am commanded to inform you, as well for the benefit of your children hereafter, as yourself immediately, that although your name is Hanchett, there is John Pitt, Earl of Chatham, Sir Gilbert Elliott, and Charles Grey: you, as well as them, the whole, as well as myself, are of the Hebrews; branches of my own family, and are descended from David king of Israel.</P>
<P>All this has been told me by revelation from the Lord God, in visions of the night.</P>
<P>There are many of my family, which have heard of me, and with which the Spirit of God has given me favor, that do not want either in∣clination or ability to demonstrate their friend∣ship: but they are deterred, from a fear of offending Government, and from a fear of incur∣ring the imputation of guilt, by being generous.</P>
<P>The pre-ordained and designed signet of peace for all nations, cannot do any thing that will ultimately tend to injure any prince gov∣ernment, or individual: if they view his words in a contrary light, it is because they calculate

<P>The Elijah, mentioned in this chapter, and the messenger, mentioned in the first verse of the third chapter, mean two distinct persons. The one was the immediate messenger of Christ, when he came for the salvation of mankind;— the other, his recorded prophet, to pronounce his judgments, and warn the world, before he comes to destroy it.</P>
<P>This is that great prophet alluded to in the last chapter, under the name of Elijah, and not

St. John the Baptist: he will possess the Spirit of God equal to Elijah, and have the power of his fire in the same manner.

<P>At a former time, when I was entreating God to spare London, I mentioned no man by his title: but when I was writing an account of it for public information, he said to me, "unless you write their titles, they themselves wont know who you mean." It will appear strange, because I am not acquainted with any of the di∣stinguished persons alluded to; but I knew ever∣one by some particular act that caught my ap∣probation, and made me remember them then. It secured as if God had done this on purpose, for he has often said to me since, in visions and
<PB N="148" REF="028354_0145_0FD8A940D5CB48E0"/>
revelations at night, You must be a wall of de∣fence and safety to many a great man;—yes, even to some that despise you now. At that time, after mentioning the name of William Pitt, I passed by that of his brother; immedi∣ately after, the Lord God reminded me of it, and, in a voice of great softness and good na∣ture, said, There is <HI>John Pitt,</HI> wont you mention him? You dont know who he is <HI>I forgave.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of 1790 the Spirit of God begun first, (although I always had a presentiment of being sometime or other very great,) to en∣lighten my understanding, and teach me to dis∣tinguish right from wrong. At that time I was an officer in the navy, and considering that vol∣untary swearing, which I was obliged to comply with every six months as a qualification to receive my pay, was unnecessary, unjust, and wicked, I requested to be indulged with permis∣sion to receive it without; stating at the same time, the concealed and unheeded cruelty of the oath, with my own reasons for objecting to the form: when I was told, in answer to my request, that there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to dispense with it.</P>
<P>Soon after this I made another request, sup∣porting my objections to voluntary swearing, with observing. That if the <HI>order of council</HI> en∣forced an oath in any manner or under any form whatever, and that the man it was directed to operate on, swore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a voluntary act—<HI>the result of his own free will,</HI>—would it not in the sight of God in heaven, and every <HI>man</HI> of dis¦cernment
<PB N="149" REF="028354_0146_0FD8A942130EFF70"/>
under him on earth, amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to a false oath?</P>
<P>These reasons with these objections, and the letter I received from the admiralty, stating their insufficient power to dispense with the usu∣al form of swearing, I published at that time in the newspaper called the <HI>Public Advertiser.</HI></P>
<P>During the time of my writing officially to the Admiralty I had occasion to write also to the president, whom I knew to be a member of the council; with the business of Swearing, which led me to make an application, I remark∣ed to him, That as men, whether few in number or the increased multitude of a senate were not infallible, they must consequently be subject to error. To corroborate more forcibly this as∣sertion, and likewise to impress a conviction of its justice, I mentioned among other things, a decision of the privy council relative to a native of Glasgow, who had his ship seized in the West Indies for an <HI>undesigned</HI> infringement of the Navigation act.</P>
<P>After a legal investigation in that country, it was clearly proved, and openly acknowledged, that although the apparent defect in the register might authorize the seizure, it could not justify a condemnation; because the commander, <HI>like an honest man,</HI> shewed it at the Custom-house, and received the approbation of the principal officer.</P>
<P>An appeal was lodged against this acquittal, by the seizing officer in the West Indies, and brought before the Privy Council in England! —the ship was condemned.</P>
<P>To constitute a High Court of Equity, its
<PB N="150" REF="028354_0147_0FD8A94363A601D0"/>
members, to pronounce their judgment agreea∣ble to that very name their existence as a court is derived from, must be governed more by the <HI>Intention</HI> than the presumptive proof. But to constitute a Court of Law, its judges must be directed by the express letter of the act of par∣liament under which they officiate.</P>
<P>For example, two men go into a forest; while the one is fetching a blow to cut down a tree, the axe flies from the handle and kills the other: Here is a presumptive proof of murder, and the law very justly brings the survivor to trial. But <HI>equity,</HI> viewing this circumstance in a proper light, declares the innocence, and acquits ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>Another, and more revelant to the seizure.— A man buys a stamp, to legalize a bond for the better security of trading with his money, <HI>or in plainer language, lending it on interest;</HI> to be certain that this stamp is warrantably just, ac∣cording to the prescribed forms of law, he shews it at the Stamp-office, where it is ac∣knowledged to be good and safe: after this, in consequence of some defect, it is declared illegal, and the holder subjected to a penalty.</P>
<P>I believe every man on earth, that has the common faculty of distinguishing white from black, will agree with me in saying, that it would be repugnant to equity to fine the holder for a defect that he had no knowledge of as such, and for what was authorised by the very office of government that always issued the stamps.</P>
<P>The law supposes criminality from the ap∣pearance; but equity measures it from the de∣sign. The one is external and visible, provided
<PB N="151" REF="028354_0148_0FD8A9480E575F18"/>
many years before it may be wanted: the other is internal and spiritual, always alive in the heart of every judge that possesses prudence, learning, and penetration.</P>
<P>When I was writing of these things, to the Earl of Chatham, on my knees! made a solemn vow to the Almighty God, declaring that if he would be pleased to enable me, I would most surely procure an inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nification for the poor man that lost his ship. Since that time the Lord God has told me, by revelation at night, That he would most truly enable me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for if I liked, I should be President of the Council, and Chancel∣lor of the Exchequer: I should have any thing that I required. Immediately after this, I heard another voice from heaven, say, The Lord have mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, if they had not you for their friend and counsellor; for England is the Spi∣ritual Egypt mentioned in the 11th chapter of the Revelation to St. John.</P>
<P>After making the numerous representations I have mentioned, the Earl of Chatham, with great propriety, acknowledged their justice so far as to erase the word <HI>Voluntary</HI> from the pre∣scribed form of swearing: but I was then re∣minded of the words of Christ in the 5th chap∣ter, 34th verse of St. Matthew, and strictly commanded to obey them. Soon after this, I requested from the Admiralty, and often repeated it, a dispensing order that I might receive my pay without an oath; but they would not grant it.</P>
<P>If the Earl of Chatham had shewn me the small favour I asked for, and certainly it would have been but a very small one to him, he should be held up to the world, at my friend,
<PB N="152" REF="028354_0149_0FD8A949839C5100"/>
to be admired and regarded; he should wear such a durable coronet as would make him the envy of princes; it should be a coronet that no human power would ever be able to remove.</P>
<P>As the Admiralty would not give me that reasonable indulgence I requested, as they would not shew me that kindness which as men living by the navy, they might have done with ease, and without prejudice to their dignity; I want∣ed for a bit of bread to eat: I was besides treat∣ed so ill, as to be dragged to a work-house with∣out any legal authority, against every remon∣strance I could make, and against every threat I could make use of to call them to a strict ac∣count for the injustice. The Admiralty knew all this; they might have prevented it, by or∣dering what was due to me to be paid; but they would neither prevent the evil, nor enable me to be liberated: they would not order the pay∣ment of what was due, until open falsehood was made use of to say I was out of my senses. It seemed as if they were under some private ap∣prehension, though pleased with my distress, of being charged one day or other in the eyes of their country with unfeeling cruelty, and want∣ed some kind of colourable evidence to justify the proceeding.</P>
<P>Hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore, all nations, and be warned by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, what the Lord God has told me by rev∣elation, and now commands me to write, that the injuries I received, because de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for obeying his word, in the blessed gospel, the remembrance of them should never be blessed out from the throne of heaven. Moreover, he said likewise, That he would shake the English admiralty as a man would violently bread in a basket, until
<PB N="153" REF="028354_0150_0FD8A94B04B5C7B0"/>
he loosed the foundations of the earth, and shook the place in pieces.</P>
<P>If I am out of my senses, in the opinion of the admiralty, for refusing first to take an idle oath, secondly, a false one, and thirdly, to take any: Christ the Saviour of the world, and him that Isaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Counsellor, who prohibits by his Gospel in the strongest terms all kind of swearing, must, by the same rule of knowledge for giving such a command, be out of his.</P>
<P>As the Quakers never swear, and their ob∣jections to it are sanctioned by a just indulgence of law; they, the king and parliament, for giving the indulgence, must for the same reason as I am, be out of theirs.</P>
<P>Christ having been abused at Jerusalem, re∣proached with having a devil, being mad, and out of his senses, makes it the less astonishing for me, that am his servant, to be reviled in the same manner: For which the Lord God com∣mands me to remind all men, from the testimo∣ny of his blessed Gospel, that the sin is blasphe∣my against his Holy Spirit, and that the punish∣ment is everlasting fire.</P>
<P>It is from visions and revelations, and through the Holy Ghost, that I write this book for the benefit of all men: therefore, to say it is false, that I am mad, am an impostor, have a de∣vil, or am out of my senses, constitutes the dan∣gerous sin of blasphemy.</P>

<HEAD>The following are some more of the <HI>VISIONS,</HI> which God shewed me, and which I am command∣ed to publish here.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month called July, 1791, I was in a vision, and was carried away by the spirit of God, to the sea coast, in the English channel— a new ridge of unknown land was brought in an instant plain to my eyes, while the finger of a hand wrote, in large capital letters, with great quickness, and a voice pronounced twice from heaven, at the same time,
<Q>SWEDE, SWEDE!</Q></P>
<P>After this I was in a vision in the month of January 1792, and was carried away by the Spirit of God to Sweden, when I was made look through a window in a room; I did, and saw a man walk from the side of a great chair, lea∣ving it empty. I could not see his face as he went away, and although I could not, nor per∣ceive that he had committed any crime, I thought with myself that he had been doing wrong. Immediately the angel that stood by me said, The chair means the chair of state;— and that man you saw will make it empty. The king of Sweden is <HI>delivered over for death,</HI> and that is the very man that will shoot him.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange is closely pursued like∣wise, but he is not delivered over yet.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and saw the Prussian eagle perched on a chair of state; soon
<PB N="160" REF="028354_0157_0FD8A95B6468EC40"/>
after, on a sudden, I saw the chair, the house, and the whole city where the chair stood, in flames. The angel that was near me, said, He is likewise pursued now.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and the Lord God talked with me, and said, I give you the life of the Swede; but know this for certain, that if you prevent his death, the man himself will not believe there was any danger of it.— And when you write hereafter of things in this country, you will be called an impostor, a fool, and a liar: you will be imprisoned, and treat∣ed very ill. When I see this, it will make me angry; I will then begin to kill the people, and I will surely destroy this city.</P>
<P>For which I gave no public information to warn the king of Sweden, and prevent his death. Had this man lived, he would have commanded the German army against France; his private plan was to go through Normandy, close by the sea coast, to be supplied the easier with provi∣sions from England, and endeavour, by all pos∣sible means, to take the harbour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest.</P>
<P>He said to himself, in his own closer. This is the plan I will pursue; it will be giving a mor∣tal blow to the French navy, and getting a safe harbour for our own ships.</P>
<P>All this was made known to me by revelation from the Lord God; and which I communicated to the queen and minister of state in 1792, some¦time before the provinces of Brittany and Nor∣mandy shewed any open appearance of hostility against the present government of France.</P>
<P>In the month of April 1793, I was in a vision, and was carried away in the spirit of God in Russia, where I saw a Bear stop and rest itself
<PB N="161" REF="028354_0158_0FD8A95F338F2C48"/>
under a large tree; soon after I beheld a man, that lay concealed among the branches, drop down softly, and with a sharp piece of iron, which he held in his hand, stab the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear; pro∣nouncing, as he did so, I have watched a long time for you, but now I have caught you at last.</P>
<P>I know by revelation from the Lord God, that this vision means the present empress of Russia; for which, being permitted, I give her this warning.</P>
<P>Let the death of the kings of Sweden and France, which is but a little time past; the death of the king of Spain and another, which will soon take place, for they are pursued; con∣vince the princes and the people of Europe, that the seventh chapter of Daniel and the se∣cond of Haggai are now fulfilling.</P>
<P>At a former time, when the Lord God was instructing me in a knowledge of the laws and other things, relative to the nation I am ap∣pointed to govern, he said, in a vision of the night, When I bring princes and people from all nations to bow down to you; when I begin to exalt you above the kings of the earth—Be sober, be modest, be reasonable. And immedi∣ately after he added, You may inform the king of England that I call you my nephew.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March, 1794, I was in a vision and saw the sun in its full strength, clear and high up in the firmament: soon after I saw ano∣ther sun rise on a sudden, equally large as the former, and stand close by it: both shone with equal brightness, and the last, as well as the first, enlightened the world.</P>
<P>After the first division of this copy was sent.
<PB N="162" REF="028354_0159_0FD8A960A4A5BE90"/>
to be printed, and even some of it done, the printer was advised not to do it according to my form; for, if he did, prosecution, imprison∣ment, and perhaps hanging, would be the con∣sequence to him. For which the Lord God com∣mands me to keep back the additional informa∣tion that otherways would be given, and termi∣nate the book.</P>
<P>I have said already that the sixth chapter of the Revelation was now fulfilling: the <HI>four first seals</HI> are opened, and the covering, which kept the meaning of the prophecies a profound secret until the present time, is removed: the <HI>recorded</HI> decrees are held up, and God himself commands a knowledge, of their contents to be published for the good of all nations. But if I cannot have the commands of God, and a knowledge of his judgments, printed exactly as I write, how is this extension of mercy to be known o∣ver Europe, and the people of London inform∣ed of any danger that is past, or any danger that is to come? All the prophecies in the Scripture were given through men: the Nine-inevites were warned through one.</P>
<P>How is the king to save himself from that <HI>re∣corded,</HI> determined, and unavoidable death,— which all the powers of armies cannot pre∣vent? How is London and the parliament to be saved, when they are recorded in the Scripture of truth to be destroyed? How is England, Eu∣rope, and most parts of the world to be saved, when they are recorded to be filled with blood by war, and to be made desolate for ever by earthquakes if the person I employ is deterred, by the fears of prosecution and evil, from print∣ing the full copy, exactly as I give it▪</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="028354_0160_0FD8A962E40227A8"/>The king of Egypt and his people were de∣destroyed, because they would not believe Mo∣ses; but the king of Nineveh and his people were saved, because they did believe Jonah, and reform.</P>
<P>The king of England, the chancellor of the Exchequer, secretaries of state, other members of administration, and as many members of both houses of parliament, as my ability will allow; the bishops, judges and all the foreign ambassadors in London; will have a book sent to each.</P>
<P>On account of my being insulted, because the Jews do not believe in the first book, by a pub∣lic acknowledgment of it, the Lord God com∣mands me to remind all men of what is wrote in that book, and to say, that as the Jews do not believe in Christ, it cannot be expected that they will in me; <HI>neither are they,</HI> until I am re∣vealed in a similar manner to Moses in Egypt, but with the additional power of sire as his sign, to make them.</P>
<P>The night before I had finished this book for the press, the Lord God shewed it to me in a vision, ready printed, holding it up at the same time by one leaf, and shaking all the others open, while he pronounced, in strong clear words, and commanded me to write them down exactly as he spoke, for universal information:</P>
<P>There is nothing in this book that the En∣glish law can take hold of:—So says Him that Isaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Counsellor.</P>
<P>I request every body, in all nations, to read this book with attention, and receive it savour∣ably, for although the information and warn∣ing
<PB N="164" REF="028354_0161_0FD8A9664E394BE0"/>
it contains is through me, yet it is not mine, but God's.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD>DEUTERONOMY, CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P N="15">15 The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.</P>
<P N="16">16 According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God; neither let me see this great fire any more that I die not.</P>
<P>The time of the world, alluded to by Moses, though not expressly mentioned in this chapter, when a prophet would be raised up, to order the restoration of the children of Israel in the latter days, (for he was fully informed of all the calamities <HI>that would befal them, afterwards their deliverance and return, to be dispersed no more,</HI> as the thirty-second chapter sufficiently testifies, is the present; and myself the man— the designed prophet, <HI>as leader of the Jews,</HI> to ful∣fil

a similar character, according to his own words, <HI>like unto me.</HI></P>
<P>For Christ is the head of all prophecy; from him flows the Divine Spirit of truth: he is Lord and God; he is all that Isaiah says of him—the Wonderful Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</P>
<P>Moses was but a man, and to a man like him∣self he alludes; as the Lord himself likewise declares in the three following verses.</P>
<P N="17">17 And the Lord said to me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken;</P>
<P N="18">18 I will raise them up a prophet from a¦mong their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.</P>
<P N="19">19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken to my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</P>

<HEAD>The meaning of this Chapter having been always misunderstood by expounders of the Scripture, I am commanded to insert and explain it for the benefit of all men. <HI>ACTS,—CHAP. VII.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="29">29 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian, where he be∣gat two sons.</P>
<P N="30">30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him, in the wilderness of mount Sina, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</P>
<P N="31">31, 32 Saying I am the God of thy fa∣thers, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="37">37 This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me.</P>
<P>This is he <HI>(meaning Moses still, and not the prophet alluded to in the preceding verse; who was not Christ neither, as has always been erroneously supposed)</HI> that was in the church, (meaning the tabernacle) in the wilderness <HI>with the angel</HI> which spoke <HI>to him</HI> in mount Sinai.</P>
<P N="39">39 To whom our fathers would not obey— (meaning Moses) but thrust him from them, (meaning Moses: often did he fast, and pray, that God might not destroy the congregation,) and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt.</P>
<P>Who was the conspicuous person that the an∣gel constantly accompanied, manifested himself to, and talked with during forty years in the wilderness, according to the 38th verse, but
<PB N="168" REF="028354_0165_0FD8A96FC58ADE78"/>
Moses? Who did the angel speak to in mount Sinai from a flame of fire in a bush? St. Stephen meant no other here than Moses.</P>
<P N="40">40 Saying to Aaron, make us Gods to go be∣fore us; for, as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</P>
<P>Expounders of the Scriptures have always supposed that St. Stephen, by repeating in this chapter the verses I have inserted from Deuter∣onomy, meant Christ to be the prophet alluded to by Moses, which is, <HI>like himself,</HI> to collect and lead home the Jews; but he does not; he re∣peats it as in historical account, to remind the council, before which he stood for judgment, that as their fathers had before rejected Moses in the wilderness, so did they their children re∣ject Christ at Jerusalem. But in no one part does he, or St. Peter in the 3d chapter, mean that Christ is the prophet alluded to by Moses in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy,—<HI>as the fortieth verse even sufficiently testifies.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD>REVELATION TO ST. JOHN, CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>St. John the Apostle in this chapter describes a woman as cloathed with the sun, <HI>the moon under her feet, (meaning darkness, or the Turk∣ish empire in Asia,)</HI> and a crown of twelve stars on her head. The sun alluded to is not the sun in the firmament, neither is that sun the Lord Jesus Christ, as has been always errone∣ously supposed. The woman is not the church, nor yet the Blessed Virgin, the mother of Christ, as has always been likewise erroneously suppo∣sed;
<PB N="169" REF="028354_0166_0FD8A97123F809D0"/>
but that sun, means an entire man com∣posed of flesh and blood like any other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that woman, the princess of Israel. The prince is represented as a sun, because that through him God will enlighten the world with more know∣ledge than ever it had yet, and give a fresh manifestation of his mercy to prolong its dura∣tion. The woman, as his consort, is represented as clothed with him, and also as wearing a crown of twelve stars; because he, as her hus∣band, is prince of the twelve tribes.</P>
<P>The child, <HI>who will govern all nations immedi∣ately under and next to God,</HI> being caught up to God and to his throne, means no more than the child going up to Jerusalem, where the throne of God will be on earth. The woman's going into the wilderness, means going up to Jerusa∣lem also: the words into the wilderness are mentioned because the city is situated <HI>far inland</HI> from the sea. The dragon means a European prince now alive, who will pour out proclama∣tions and manifestoes after me, as a flood would issue from the mouth of a dragon: <HI>for Satan will be in him.</HI></P>
<P>At the time God was explaining this chapter to me, be said, when I give you power to de∣stroy that man from the face of the earth, you will melt into pity and spare his life; for which all my people will universally blame you, be∣cause he is their enemy and oppressor. Those strange names are given, and those difficult al∣lusions to be understood, are made by St. John on purpose to seal the true meaning of the pro∣phecies and revelation an entire secret, <HI>according to the 5th chapter;</HI> until the full time is accom∣plished,
<PB N="170" REF="028354_0167_0FD8A974EC8A3CA8"/>
and the appointed person made known to publish them to the world.</P>
<P>The prophet Ezekiel in the visions of God to him, describes the great extent, and grandeur of Jerusalem at a future time; and likewise of its being governed by a human prince.</P>
<P>This is the very man, <HI>the appointed of God</HI> that is now abused, and publicly reproached in London—<HI>the capital of the spiritual Egypt, as is mentioned by St. John in the 11th chapter,</HI> with being a hypocrite, and a fanatic impostor.</P>
<P>Remember those things, O my God; and as thy thunder on the 7th of this month—August —was to shew thy full determination to throw down cities, and dash in pieces the council of evil men, if they committed any violence against me, <HI>for otherways I should now be lying in the common prison</HI>—So, O my God, execute; for they have no faith to believe thy just judgments, nor charity to be civil to thy messenger that declares thy great offers of mercy.</P>

<P>THE reason why these parts of Scripture, and the other things which follow, were not inserted when the first edition of this book was printed, is, the time was not accomplished, and the Lord my God would not permit them to be published until it was.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND OF SAMUEL, CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P N="44">44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, (meaning the then chil∣dren of Israel, over whom David was king.) Thou hast kept me to be head of the Heathen: a people which I know not shall serve me.</P>
<P>This promise to king David then, meant that it should be fulfilled to him in his descendent at a future time; a man, a human being, like any other that is composed of flesh and blood; but not the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God: who always was, and always will be, the head of the Heathen, and all nations. The promise was made from God to David, to be fully accom∣plished in that man's descendant; which de∣scendant, is myself; I shall, under God, rule all nations under the government of the Gospel to fulfil that covenant to David, and the promise of it by revelation to myself.</P>
<P N="45">45 Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.—<HI>(Meaning to be fulfilled in his descendent, as soon as they hear of his revelation.)</HI></P>
<P N="46">46 Strangers shall fade away, and they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all be afraid to come out of their close places.</P>
<P N="47">47 The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock: and exalted be the God—the rock of my sal∣vation.</P>
<P N="48">48 It is God that avengeth me, and that brings down the people under me; and that brings me forth from my enemies.</P>
<P N="49">49 Thou also be lifted me up on high, above them that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</P>
<P N="50"><PB N="172" REF="028354_0169_0FD8A97C05547C98"/>50. Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, <HI>among the Heathen,</HI> and I will sing praises to thy name.</P>
<P>Here, David, who was not himself among the Heathen, was praising God for his descend∣ant that should have this promise fulfilled to him, and who should be among the Heathen.</P>
<P N="51">51 He (meaning the Lord) is a Tower of Salvation for his king: (meaning the descendant of David as king, ruling over all nations under the covenant and constant direction of God,) and sheweth mercy to his Anointed, under David, and to his seed for evermore.</P>
<P>That Christ, the Saviour of the world, should be born of a Virgin, and that he should be cal∣led the Wonderful Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace, Isaiah the prophet sufficiently testifies: that Christ was so born, St. Matthew the Apostle witnesses in the first chapter of that part of the Gospel wrote by him. And Christ himself says in the 22d chapter, when speaking to the Pha∣risees,—"What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David. He says to them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying, the Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool? if David then call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man, from that day forth, all him any more ques∣tions."</P>
<P>The words are, "Unto David and to his seed for ever more."</P>
<P>It means, to continue in succession from father
<PB N="173" REF="028354_0170_0FD8A97D5C6881B8"/>
to son, from the one as a man, to the other as a man, while the world lasts.</P>
<P>The Blessed Virgin Mary, <HI>through whom Christ the Redeemer, who was God, came into the world,</HI> was descended from king David: it is for this that Christ, though he was the Everlasting Fa∣ther and Creator of all things, is alluded to as the son of David.</P>
<P>Mary was first cousin to that Joseph, who was promised to be her husband when found with child by the Holy Ghost. <HI>St. Matthew, chapter</HI> 1st. Both Mary and Joseph were des∣cended from one grandfather, who was Mat∣than; she the daughter of one brother, and Joseph the son of the other. <HI>Told me by reve∣lation</HI> from the Lord God.</P>

<HEAD>More of the <HI>VISIONS,</HI> which God shewed me, and which I am now commanded to publish.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month called June, 1791, at the hour of two in the afternoon, I saw a hand, from the wrist downwards, like the hand of a man, with the fore finger pointed out, appear on a sudden a little above the height of my head, near the door, on the wall or partition of the room I was then in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> After this I was informed, by revela∣tion, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, from the Lord God, that it meant the speedy end of the present king of England and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pire, like Belshazzar and Babylon, both of which would soon be destroyed.</P>
<P>In the month called May, 1792, I was in a vision, and receiving instruction from God of fu∣ture things: he shewed me the queen, greatly alarmed at his judgments, by my revelation, with the power of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and immediately she cried out, The Lord have mercy on us! we shall all be destroyed, we shall all be destroyed! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> After this I was in a vision again, and the Lord God shewed me the present queen of Eng∣land, coming towards me, slow, trembling, and
<PB N="175" REF="028354_0172_0FD8A980261A8440"/>
afraid. This was communicated, with other things, to William Pitt, in the month called June, 1792. And likewise, informing him, at the same time, that it would most certainly be fulfilled: It will: it is established with God, and will be so.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the month of June, 1792, I was in a vision, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God, to the palace called St. James's, where I saw the present king of England; he rose from his seat on seeing me, and immediate∣ly sent me his own magnificent star, at the same time breathing on it, and kissing, as if kissing to take a last farewel; yet not with grief and re∣luctance to give, but with evident satisfaction. Why the king of England should take his own conspicuous ornament, and send it to me, was a thing that I was greatly astonished at; I wished to know the meaning, but could not discover; until a loud voice pronounced, down from hea∣ven, The Lord God delivers his life over into your hands, and he will give you any thing to preserve it. This vision, with others, and other things, was communicated, by Divine command, to the king, in 1792. The letter, which con∣tained it, with others to the king, the queen, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, were put into the penny-post office, to be sent by that convey∣ance, according to the directions I received on that head by revelation from God.</P>
<P>1794. This day, called Thursday, and the 12th of the month called June, I was in a vision, at the hour of two in the afternoon, when the Lord God spoke to me in a voice of great quick∣ness, carrying me away to the Bank of England at the same time, and saying, There is one of
<PB N="176" REF="028354_0173_0FD8A984ADD736D8"/>
twenty. The whole place rung and trembled with the clear, but sharp sound of his words, it is by his sacred and particular command I mention this vision in writing.</P>
<P>The 13th, in the morning, the Lord God said to me, among other things, in a vision, You see those people do not believe, neither will they for all your endeavours; why then do you con∣tinue to entreat me for them?</P>
<P>The 14th, in the morning, the Lord God spoke to me, and said, The judgment is now against this nation; the thunder, just past, was to proclaim it: Pharaoh is appointed to die, and his government to be destroyed; the priests, and all the abominable idolatries of Egypt, shall perish, never to be found any more.</P>

<P N="1">1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli; and the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</P>
<P N="2">2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see, and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep,</P>

<P N="6">6 And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</P>

<P N="8">8 And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose, and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.</P>

<P>1794. The 25th of the month called June, the Lord God said to me in a vision of the night, on my bed, In seven days more the judgment will be on this nation.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and the Lord God brought close to me, that I might hear the report of a gun that was fired, and see a man privately shoot at another, to kill him: it was
<PB N="178" REF="028354_0175_0FD8A98864CBB550"/>
so near, that I saw the flash, and smelt the pow∣der. Before the death of the king of Sweden I was shewn, in a vision, similar to this, that he would be delivered over from the protection of God, to be shot.</P>
<P>I know, because the Lord God has explained it to me by revelation, that this vision means, the man fired at to be the present king of En∣gland. He will be shot, but not killed; he will be wounded, but not mortally.</P>
<P>He has not believed me at any time, although I fully informed him in 1792, and since, that it would be so: neither will he, until the very evil is visited on him: and visited on him, to increase his distress, at a time when he is sur∣rounded with danger, and loaded with trouble; it most certainly will. Then the king of En∣gland will be convinced by woeful and feeling proofs, but it will be very late;— comparative∣ly, when Death knocks at the door, that he de∣spised the offered mercy of God in 1792, and constantly since his best friend, among mankind, as false.</P>
<P>In the month called March, 1794, I was in a vision, and the Lord God shewed me a large and very tall oak tree it stood alone; it was en∣tirely withered, and all its branches were cut off. While I was considering the tree, its lonely condition and nakedness, I heard a very loud voice call out of heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew down that tree. Immediately, the tree was covered with a thick cloud of darkness, and an angel descended from God, who struck the tree with so violent a blow that it fell to the ground, and in its fall it made a great noise.</P>
<P>1794. First of the month called July, the
<PB N="179" REF="028354_0176_0FD8A98BD87F6C60"/>
Lord God said to me, among other things, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vision, early in the morning, for I had been ear∣nestly praying to him the evening before to hasten my revelation to the Jews, and inform me how long it would be until it took place; because I was daily abused as an impostor, for publishing his commands, by wicked men; ev∣ery one of them led on under the influence of an evil spirit—You must be at Constantinople, in your way to Jerusalem, by this time the next year.</P>
<P>The 2d of the same month, the Lord God said to me, in a vision on my bed, early in the morn∣ing, in breaking bread you must not any longer say, to any person, Peace and friendship, but salvation only to the spiritual.</P>
<P>I know, by revelation, that Christopher Love, a clergyman, who was unjustly tried, condemn∣ed, and put to death in London, in the year of 1651, had the divine Spirit of the living God, and prophecied from it. He testified of me at that time under different names, though all of them meant one and the same person; that of a Bright Star, as a Sound of Thunder in the Ears of the Wicked, a Lantern to the Jews, and a Great Man.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to give this testimony, and also to say, that he will soon send, in anger, the visitation of his judgment on Lon∣don, and call her to a strict account for shedding not only the blood of this righteous man, but likewise all his other faithful witnesses.</P>
<P>I know likewise, by revelation from the Lord God, and am commanded to write it down that John Maximilian Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was sanctified by the di∣vine Spirit of Truth, and prophecied, under its
<PB N="180" REF="028354_0177_0FD8A98DA5FA7538"/>
sacred direction, in the year of 1709. He has also testified of me under different names.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to inform you, John Wright, that you are of the Hebrews, of the tribe of Levi, descended from Aaron the high priest, by Phinchas, Zadok, and Ezra; for which the covenant to your forefather, Phinchas, of an everlasting priesthood, is renewed, given to you, to be manifested in you.</P>

<P N="10">10 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying.</P>
<P N="11">11 Phinchas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zea∣lous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</P>
<P N="12">12 Wherefore say, Behold I give to him my covenant of peace:</P>
<P N="13">13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him; even the covenant of an everlasting priest∣hood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.</P>
<P>This is the recorded testimony which the Lord my God commands me to give; and to say to you likewise, You are sanctified by the Holy Ghost, the divine Spirit of Truth.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say to all you, professing Christianity, whom I have, by his sa∣cred direction, acknowledged to be of the He∣brews, descended from Israel; for you, and your children after you, are some of his chosen peo∣ple; not to take up, in obedience to any law or any human power whatever, warlike arms, to

shed blood, or commit violence, in consequence of the approaching calamities which he will most surely bring on this Egyptian land.</P>
<P>Neither mind the people that blaspheme God, and revile you for believing in his testimonies: the wicked have always rose against the righte∣ous, and this land, like Egypt of old, has many task-masters to abuse and oppress in it. There∣fore comfort yourselves in the knowledge of the promises of God to his servants: For I declare, by his sacred command, that the visible Jews are but few in number, compared to the great multitude prosessing Christianity, but all de∣scended from the former Jews in the land of Israel, the forefathers of the present visible ones; which were, at different times, led cap∣tives into all nations: your lives are long, theirs but short; you are the holy seed, the people and saints of the Most High; to whom, and your children for ever, belongs the pos∣session and government of his kingdom.</P>
<P>The Lord God, who was the Lord Jesus Christ, commands me now, and not until now, to insert the following testimonies, <HI>as a warning to all blasphemers,</HI> and as a reason to all men, that do not know, why he said to me, in the preceding part of this book.

<P N="38">38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</P>

<P N="43">43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</P>
<P N="47">47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind; which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</P>

<P>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard <HI>as it were the sound of thunder,</HI> one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.— And I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him had a bow: and a crown was given to him; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</P>
<P N="3">3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.— And there went out another horse that was red; and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.</P>
<P N="5">5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.— And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</P>
<P N="7">7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him: and power was

given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</P>
<P N="9">9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimo∣ny which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying. How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth. And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, That they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</P>

<P N="2">2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake; some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting con∣tempt.</P>
<P N="3">3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="4">4 But, thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <HI>even to the time of the end:</HI> many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</P>
<P N="8">8 And I heard, but understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?</P>

<P N="10">10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</P>
<P>At this time, which is the time alluded to by the angel informing Daniel, the earth will quake, and be rent in many places: the heaven will be convulsed, opening and shutting, and
<PB N="190" REF="028354_0187_0FD8A9A5ACD89B28"/>
shewing many fearful signs;—there will be storms of wind, hail, and showers of rain, with violent thundering and lightning;—the very beasts of the field, birds of the air, and fishes of the sea, will be frightened: all the inhabi∣tants of the earth will tremble for their lives, dreading that it is the hour of their dissolution, and day of universal judgment; so fierce and terrible will the great anger of God be mani∣fested against a wicked world, professing Christ with their lips, but teaching rebellion against his blessed Gospel in their public laws and forms of prayer.</P>
<P>Swearing oaths; the Lord's supper, or taking the sacrament to remember him and commemo∣rate the awful moment when he gave it to his disciples, is made a qualification, even to the most unthinking, abandoned, and wicked, to serve in any public office or employment whatever.</P>
<P>Of the public prayers. Our Father, which art in heaven; hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; <HI>which is the kingdom of peace;</HI> is very good: but the next form of prayer is beseeching God to go forth with fleets and ar∣mies: this is very bad, because it is in direct opposition to the former; it encourages strife, hatred, war, and bloodshed; it is calling on God to keep back his kingdom, and to over∣throw his own gospel of peace. The worship of christians ought to be pure, humble, and peaceable without any mixture of politics or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tional constraints from human law.</P>
<P>The bishops are called Lords Spiritual.—To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdain a clergyman, he must kneel down before a bishop, while he says, "Receive the Holy

Ghost for the office and work of a priest in the church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained."</P>
<P>Likewise, at the consecration of a bishop, it is said, "Receive the Holy Ghost, for the office and work of a bishop in the church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. <HI>Amen. And remember</HI> that thou stir up the grace of God, which is given thee <HI>by this imposition of our hands.</HI>"</P>
<P>As there is in truth no Lord but God, no man ought to assume his sacred name. No man is Spiritual that has not the Holy Ghost, the divine Spirit of Truth; it is by Christ that it is given, and he will not give it to any that promotes the evil of war and disobedience to his gospel. A prince may give to a man a title, but it is God only that can make him Spiritual: he cannot give that mighty Spirit which he has not the power to command, and which he never recei∣ved the gift of himself. To pursue then any longer such a false form of ordination and con∣secration, is not only dishonorable to the king, parliament, and people of England, but also a reproach to the bishops to attempt to give, and to the clergy to kneel down to receive.</P>
<P>Turn from such deceitful unmanly ways, and endeavor to live long; for it is the word of God through a man that points at the crime, and warns you to forsake, what must, if you do not, lead to certain death: for believe me, the
<PB N="192" REF="028354_0189_0FD8BD775469E038"/>
day of destruction to punish disobedience to the gospel is so very nigh, that it will take place before the commencement of eight months from this day.</P>
<P>Look at your wives, your children, and all that is dear to you on earth; then consider how great the blessing to have them, to live with, and possess them; but how terrible the evil to separate, to be burnt with fire—to die, and lose them for ever.</P>
<P>Remember, God created man in his own image and likeness, and created the earth for his use; that man might believe in him, and obey his commands.</P>
<P>He brought the children of Israel out of Egypt to conduct them to the promised land,— but when they disobeyed him in the wilderness, he destroyed thousands of them. He burnt So∣dom and Gomorrah, because the people were wicked; but he saved Nineveh, which was also denounced, because the people repented.</P>
<P>The Lord God is great, merciful, and com∣passionate to forgive all that do entreat and obey his commands; but be assured, he is also great, mighty, and powerful, jealous of his sa∣cred name and honor when given to men: and he can do now what he did of old, <HI>they are re∣corded for our example and warning,</HI> that is, overthrow cities,—and destroy multitudes in an instant.</P>
<P>Life, blessing, and peace, is the inheritance of the servants, the saints, and people of the Most High.</P>

<P>All that believe in the testimony of God by me, which he now commands me to make known, are his people, a part <HI>(because the vi∣sible Jews are the great body)</HI> of that innumerable multitude, shewn by the angel to Esdras, crown∣ed, and receiving palms.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to remind all people of the loud thunder that was on the 7th of August last, and to say, It was a threat from him to destroy London, sooner than suffer me to be hurt: take it for a warning, and beware of the dreadful consequences that will most certain∣ly ensue, if a similar injury is intended against me: for if you, the English Government, are de∣termined to molest me, the Lord God is also determined to oppose you; and will visit with death on his enemies, and with destruction on their capital. For the English Government, <HI>both what is called civil and ecclesiastical,</HI> in its present form, will, by the fierce anger and de∣termined judgment of the Lord God, be re∣moved,
<PB N="196" REF="028354_0193_0FD8C2AE8813A080"/>
annihilated, and utterly destroyed, be∣fore the expiration of ten months from this day.</P>
<P>For those unhappy men, which compose it, as if the injustice of the present war was not sufficient to provoke him, have imprudently gone on, adding evil to evil, and now, more than before, publicly encourage blasphemy a∣gainst him, and abuse against his prophet. Why do they do so? said the Lord God to me. Why? because you have not their <HI>mark,</HI> but my seal; you have not their authority, the laying on the hands of their bishops, to give the Holy Ghost to prophecy by, but my Spirit, <HI>yet these are the men that pretend to judge of spirits,</HI> to discern the good from the evil: they suppose every man, that writes or speaks under the power and in∣fluence of God, is a false prophet, an impostor under delusion; because the words of truth, by him, go to contradict their mark, their human ordinances, and political forms of prayer.</P>
<P>The Lord Jesus Christ says, in the fifteenth chapter of his Gospel by St. Matthew, "But in vain they do worship me, teaching, for doc∣trines, the commandments of men."</P>
<P>And because the annunciation of my kingdom of peace and preservation, brings with it the sentence of death against their kingdom of war and human destruction; therefore, hear what the Lord God says to me by revelation, and commands me to write, That, as they have encouraged blasphemy against me, they shall not prosper; for I will send a blast on them that will confound all their counsels: and, as they have encouraged abuse against you, whom I sent, and who entreated me for their good, I will deliver them over to the power of their en∣emies;
<PB N="197" REF="028354_0194_0FD8C2AFF15BB630"/>
to be hated by every body, despised, and trod under foot like mire in the streets.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say, for the information of the English government, the judges, and all men, that the prisoners, now in confinement, and on trial for their lives, char∣ged with the crime of High Treason against the life of the king of England, are innocent: as such, he requires me to make known to the king his sacred commands in writing, and to publish this for the knowledge of all.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to inform, through this book, all that honour him—his servants—the peaceable and righteous in all na∣tions, which have had their property, whether in land or money, confiscated, for no other rea∣son than because the nation they belonged to de∣clared war against the nation they lived in, all such property, or its full value, with reasonable interest for the time, shall most surely be re∣stored.</P>
<P>And you, Peter Woulfe, one of the Avignon Society, whom the Lord my God commands me to mention here by name, as a testimony of his great regard, your property, confiscated in France, will all be restored with interest, and much kindness shewn to you by the members of its government: they will restore the property of every other <HI>peaceable individual</HI> likewise: by the same divine rule of justice, Spain, England, Prussia, Germany, Holland, and all the nations of Europe, must restore theirs. For the time of the world is just now come, and God is firm∣ly determined to manifest his mighty power, for the preservation of his people and saints, by ful∣filling

<HEAD>THE PROPHET ISAIAH, CHAP. XLI.</HEAD>
<P N="25">25 I HAVE raised up one from the north, (meaning the revealed Prince of the Hebrews at this time,) and he shall come; (meaning to Je∣rusalem, from that northern part of the world alluded to: England lies in the north, and it is indeed the country meant:) from the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treads clay.</P>
<P>Isaiah stood at Jerusalem when this prophecy was given, writing and recording it by the di∣rection of God, he looked to the northern p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the world, where this distinguished person, which he so clearly mentions, is first to rise, and then come to Jerusalem, calling on the name of the Lord, from the rising to the setting of the sun; as zealous for an obedience to the Gospel,
<PB N="199" REF="028354_0196_0FD8C2B6A658C1D8"/>
as David, his father, was for the law: travel∣ling in the mighty strength of the Spirit, and armed with the divine power of fire, like Eli∣jah, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Malachi,</HI> iv. 1. <HI>and</HI> 5. <HI>Isaiah,</HI> xi. 4. <HI>II. Es∣dras,</HI> xiii. 11.</NOTE> he will subject nations, remove thrones, and burn all rebel princes.</P>
<P N="26">26 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know; and before the time, (meaning before the prophecy is fulfilled; it being 2461 years from its declaration then to its accomplishment, now this present year of 1795,) that we may say, He is righteous! yea there is none that sheweth; yea, there is none that declareth; yea, there is none that heareth your words.</P>
<P>The king of England, and the members of his government, the parliament, bishops, judges, and all the ambassadors from foreign nations, in London, have received the information of their fall and destruction; but they all refuse to be∣lieve, and by so doing fulfil exactly what the prophet means, when he says, Yea, there is none that heareth your words.</P>
<P N="27">27 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, be∣hold them; (meaning the Jews crouding home to Jerusalem in great multitudes,) and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good ti∣dings. (It means the revealed prince, return∣ing home with the people to rebuild the deso∣late city, and make her rejoice.)</P>
<P N="28">28 For I behold, and there was no man;— even among them there was no counsellor that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</P>
<P>Here the Holy Ghost, the spirit of God,
<PB N="200" REF="028354_0197_0FD8C2FDEECEC1F0"/>
spoke by Isaiah, as if speaking by myself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for I have sent books of the judg∣ments of God to the king of England, and the members of his government, his parliament, his bishops, his judges, and all the foreign am∣bassadors in London, for their respective coun∣tries: but to accomplish what is so faithfully re∣corded by the prophet, where he speaks spiri∣tually as myself—Even among them there was no counsellor that, when I sent to them, could answer a word.</P>

<HEAD>Other Parts of the Revelation to St. John which are to be fulfilled, and which the Lord God commands me now to publish. <HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns; and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of Blas∣phemy.</P>
<P>This beast means the English Monarchy; and it is by ships and commerce that it has rose from the sea to such astonishing grandeur and magnitude. The heads, horns, and crowns, allude to the many departments of Government, and their splendid distinctions. The Blasphemy means the titles given to, and assumed by the King of England; such as, Our Most Gracious
<PB N="201" REF="028354_0198_0FD8C2B82FD22C18"/>
Sovereign Lord, Sacred Person, Majesty, De∣fender of the Faith, and Supreme Head of the Church; all which names belong to God, he only can be what they express, and when they are applied to any other, the sin is Blasphemy in his sight.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his seat, and great authority.</P>
<P>The English Monarchy, for being Supreme Head of the Church, and over the many reli∣gious sects tolerated in the country, is the reason that it is, for their great number, com∣pared to a leopard full of spots.</P>
<P>As a bear is very strong on his feet, so is the English Monarchy: and as a lion roars with his mouth the loudest of any beast, so does the English Monarchy proclaim its greatness more than any other.</P>
<P N="3">3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</P>
<P>The beginning of this verse means the death of Charles the First King of England: and the deadly wound being healed, means the recovery of Monarchy by the restoration of Charles the Second. During the interval of time between the death and succession, all the world won∣dered if the English Monarchy would ever be restored again.</P>
<P N="9">9 If any man have an ear let him hear. He that leads into captivity, shall go into captivity: be that kills with the sword must be killed with
<PB N="202" REF="028354_0199_0FD8C2BFE03671D8"/>
the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</P>
<P>The leading into captivity means imprison∣ment and slavery: and killing with the sword, means violence and war. The patience of the saints is, to bear quietly with those evils, and to resist the temptations of wealth to do them: All that have faith in God will not do such things, from a belief that they are offensive, because he commands them not.</P>
<P N="11">11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</P>
<P>This verse means the Elector of Hanover.— Coming up out of the earth, is to signify that his country or government is situated inland. The horns of a lamb, and the voice of a dragon, mean, that although he is weak in power like a lamb, yet by his voice he can threaten in great and mighty words like a dragon.</P>
<P N="12">12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It means the Elector of Hanover's succession to the crown, place, and power of the former King of England. To fulfil this part of the prophecy given by Revelation to St. John, the utter expulsion of the Stuart family must against all human opposition have taken place to admit the Elector of Hanover.</P>
<P>A great part of this chapter is taken up in describing the king and parliament. I am com∣manded to inform both of the recorded judg∣ments of God,—the dangers which threaten them, and their certainty of taking place, un∣less they implore him for mercy, and obtain it.</P>
<P>They have individually promised, by their
<PB N="203" REF="028354_0200_0FD8C2C130785B10"/>
godfathers and godmothers, in the sacred cove∣nant of baptism, and acknowledge a confirma∣tion of it by receiving the sacrament, (for both were instituted by the Lord Jesus Christ,) to believe in him and obey his commands; yet, notwithstanding this heaviest of all obligations which a human being can enter into, (for it is with his God,) and on the performance of which his salvation depends, the laws they make, a part of the Thirty-nine Articles, and some of the forms of prayer, used in public worship, goes more to break the covenant of baptism, to dishonor God, and oppose an obedience to his blessed Gospel, than was ever authorised in any other nation.</P>
<P>Without submitting to the forms of law pre∣scribed by act of parliament, which are in direct opposition to the commands of Christ, and very sinful to do, no man can hold any place of profit or trust, enjoy the privilege of freedom, and comparatively to buy or sell.</P>
<P N="17">17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</P>
<P N="18">18 Here is wisdom. Let him that has un∣derstanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.</P>
<P>This verse means the English parliament;— and although it exceeds the number mentioned here, yet, notwithstanding, it is the real and very assembly of men alluded to in the Reve∣lation, by the number of 666.</P>
<P>Because the Parliament acknowledge and ad∣dress the king by the divine names which belong only to God; such as, Our Most Gracious Sov∣ereign
<PB N="204" REF="028354_0201_0FD8C2C80574E960"/>
Lord, Sire, Majesty, and honor him with equal humility in supplication, when they re∣quire any thing, as if he really was the Lord of heaven and earth; such as, Humbly praying that your Majesty would be most graciously pleased, &amp;c. Therefore God, in his great an∣ger, being jealous of his name and honor, calls the king a beast, and the parliament his image and number.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 And I looked, and lo, a lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his father's name written in their foreheads.</P>
<P>The lamb, mentioned here, means myself, as Prince of the Hebrews; and mount Sion, Jeru∣salem: The hundred and forty-four thousand with me, having the name of my father wrote in their foreheads, mean not only the visible Jews of the twelve tribes, but likewise the in∣visible:—it comprehends all of Hebrew extrac∣tion that will believe in the testimony of God by me.</P>
<P N="6">6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel, to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people; saying, with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judg∣ment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the foun∣tains of waters.</P>
<P N="8">8 And there followed another angel, saving, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; that great city!
<PB N="205" REF="028354_0202_0FD8C2C978B5CAB0"/>
because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</P>
<P N="9">9 And the third angel followed them, saying, with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast, and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receives the mark of his name.</P>
<P N="12">12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the saith of Jesus.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 And I heard a great voice out of the tem∣ple, saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.</P>
<P N="4">4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of

the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and was, and shalt be; because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</P>
<P N="10">10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast, and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain; and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and their sores, and re∣pented not of their deeds.</P>

<P N="6">6 And he said to me. It is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: I will give to him that is a-thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</P>
<P N="8">8 But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say to you, George the Third, king of England, that im∣mediately on my being revealed, in London, to the Hebrews as their Prince, and to all nations as their Governor, your crown must be deliver∣ed up to me, that all your power and authority may instantly cease. On my being revealed, the invisible power of the angels of God, which guards me now, will then become visible as a flame of fire; the very same that accompanied Moses and the children of Israel out of Egypt.

I must not acknowledge any superior but the Lord Christ, who is the Lord God: and as a man raised up, like David, by him to be a Prince, he commands me to allow no equal, but instant∣ly to burn out of his kingdom the rebellious and disobedient. Read the xli. chap. and verse 25, of Isaiah.</P>
<P>Be advised by this, for evil is going to be let loose; when it is, the king of England will no more believe the signs of God by me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the king of Egypt would by Moses; therefore, de∣sire your servants to deliver directly to you all letters and messages from me; for, it is for your contempt to me that your country is ordered to be invaded, and your power to be destroyed.

<HEAD><HI>ANECDOTES</HI> OF RICHARD BROTHERS, <HI>THE PROPHET.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[From the Register of the Times, for March, <HI>1795.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>THIS extraordinary character having, for some months past, been the theme of the public in general, induces us to state some par∣ticulars respecting him, that, we trust, will gratify the curiosity of our readers. To see a man rising from the humble state of a work-house, to that of a person attracting the atten∣tion of all ranks and degrees, for his prophetic assertions, has justly excited astonishment. Let him be a madman, enthusiast, or hypocrite, he must be considered as the most extraordinary man this century has produced. To cause the most distinguished divines to hesitate in their opinions, respecting the truth or falsehood of his scriptural expositions, is, surely, in an untu∣tored
<PB N="2" REF="028354_0208_0FD8C2E0D59D18A8"/>
man, a most wonderful trait of character. Allowing him to be a hypocrite, to blind an appearance of truth so artfully, with the reality of falsehood, as to confound the most learned in scripture, evinces a faculty that few men, how∣ever powerful in the arts of delusion, in the course of ages, are found to possess. As a mad∣man, there is such an urbanity of manners, such a piety of principle, such a forbearance of self-gratification, such a uniform perseverance in attending to the welfare of human nature,— that we think it impossible for all the faculty, versed in the different kinds of Mania, to define the nature of Mr. Brothers's madness, and to class it under its respective species. Supposing him an enthusiast, he is equally extraordinary. Such persons are generally impelled to the most strenuous and violent of bodily and mental efforts. Their faculties are in a state of per∣petual agitation. Their passions seldom find a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uiescent pause from continual excitement.— their object, whatever it may be, so powerfully interests all their thoughts, that they are never becalmed, by rest or peace, until nature, ex∣hausted, submits to their soothing influence; but, contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o this, Mr. Brothers has appeared to be almost divested of the common passions of nature. Ever calm—ever collected—ever af∣fable and communicative of sentiments, dictated by a boundless attachment to the peace of man, if an enthusiast, he is, of all enthusiasts,—the most wonderful.</P>
<P>The above observations are stated merely as evidence of his singularity of character. They are not meant to vindicate or disprove the ve∣racity
<PB N="3" REF="028354_0209_0FD8C2E2C673FA40"/>
of his predictions, or his being the chosen restorer of the Israelites to their kingdom.</P>
<P>With regard to the particulars that have transpired respecting Richard Brothers,—we have to state the following:</P>
<P>In 1782, he was a lieutenant on board the Albion, of 64 guns. This ship being paid off in 1783, he was reduced to his half-pay, on which he supported himself until 1789, when some religious scruples arising in his mind a∣gainst the taking of oaths, he was prevented receiving his arrears until there were two years due, in 1791. At this period he lodged with a Mrs. Green, in Dartmouth-street, with whom he had then resided three years. During this time, he behaved with honesty, affable temper, and morality of principle.</P>
<P>Although he suffered the greatest distress from not receiving his arrears of pay, amounting to £. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9 by refusing to take the necessary oaths before the Agent, yet he persisted in refusing to be guilty of the crime, which he calls volunta∣rily swearing.—The reason he stated for his refusal was, that he considered swearing, every six months, as a qualification to receive pay, was unnecessary, unjust, and wicked. Having stated what he considered the concealed and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ded cruelty of the oath, in addition to ob∣jections against the form, he was told, there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to dispense with it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028354_0210_0FD8C2E3C69C3708"/>He soon after supported his former objections, and made another request, that he might receive his pay without being obliged to take the oath. On this occasion, he observed, that if the order of council inforced an oath, in any manner or any form whatever, and that the man it was di∣rected to operate upon, swore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a volun∣tary act, the result of his own free will—would it not, in the sight of God in heaven, and every man of discernment under him on earth, amount to a false oath? These reasons and objections he published, at the time, in the Public Adver∣tiser. He also published the letter he received from the admiralty, stating their insufficient power to dispense with the usual form of swear∣ing. Knowing the president of the admiralty was a member of the council, he wrote to him: In this, he stated, that as men, whether few in number, or the increased multitude of a senate, were not infallible, they must consequently be subject to error. To enforce his assertion, he alluded to the decision of the privy council, re∣lative to a native of Glasgow, who had his ship seized in the West-Indies, for what, he con∣sidered, was an undesigned infringement of the Navigation Act.</P>
<P>Such was his aversion to taking the oath, that he endured the want of even a bit of bread. Without considering him a Prophet, but merely as a man of purity and piety of principle, he is to be admired for the fortitude with which he endured his sufferings, rather than obtain relief by committing an act, which appeared to him most offensive to God and man. This conduct
<PB N="5" REF="028354_0211_0FD8C2E9E56E1F70"/>
may be admitted as a proof of his being, at least, sincere in his religious professions, however he may be the dupe of his own visionary delusions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Green being greatly distressed for the money due to her from Mr. Brothers, applied to the work house board of the United Parishes of St. Margaret's and St. John's the Evangelist, Westminster. The workhouse board consider∣ing the distress she must suffer, as well as what appeared to them, the lamentable situation of our Prophet himself, resolved to receive him as a casual pauper. Agreeably to an order from the board, he was brought about a week after to the work house. He entered the room with his hat on, and requested they would excuse his taking it off, as that homage he considered only due to the Almighty.</P>
<P>At first he appeared offended with his exami∣nation; but being desired to take a chair, his good temper returned. He then took off his hat, and said, he knew when he was treated with that respect his character demanded. In this instance, he appears to have refused taking off his hat, more from ideas of personal conse∣quence, than any peculiar homage he meant to reserve for the Almighty. His examination, containing sentiments which serve to display his temper, and the state of his mind, we insert it as follows. Pray, sir, do you know the reason of your being brought to this house? Indeed I do not. All that I know of the matter is, that I was brought in a very rough manner; but as external objects affect me but little, I acquiesce.</P>
<P>I think, sir, you are in his Majesty's service?
<PB N="6" REF="028354_0212_0FD8C2EEEE6B7410"/>
You are mistaken, I resigned two years since. I am in the service of a Prince, the greatest and most potent. A Prince, in whose services my wages will be certain; but his kingdom is not of this world. What, sir, was your reason for resigning your commission? Disgust; I con∣ceived the military life to be totally repugnant to the duties of christianity, and that I could not conscientiously receive the wages of plunder, bloodshed, and murder.</P>
<P>How did you imagine that you could live without your pay, and that pay, which, from your character and appearance, we should sup∣pose with honor to yourself and advantage to your country? Therefore I rejected. I obser∣ved before, that it was impossible for a military man, to take his pay with a safe conscience: I trust the master I serve will not suffer me to want. I shall, in a few days, receive a sum more than sufficient to pay this woman's debt, ten times over.</P>
<P>Pray, sir, have you ever been a house-keeper? I cannot absolutely say I have not: I once a∣greed for a house and was two months in pos∣session; but as a very melancholy idea comes across my mind when I think of that period, I hope you will not press me further upon the question.</P>
<P>Certainly we shall not; We understand, sir, that you were born in America? I was, in the town of Placensia▪ in Newfoundland; I have not a friend or relation in this part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028354_0213_0FD8C2F13357E7D8"/>Where did you lodge before you came to Westminster? In Bridewell precinct.</P>
<P>You will excuse us, sir, we mean it not as im∣pertinent, but as a necessary question; What did you pay weekly? I am above that false pride which shrinks from enquiry, I will answer any question you please to put to me.</P>
<P>I have already endeavoured to live within the bounds of my income—narrow as they were; but you may suppose, that out of nomi∣nally 3<ABBR>s.</ABBR> but really 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>d.</ABBR> per day, I could not afford any superb lodgings. In fact, I paid 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> per week for my room.</P>
