<HEAD>THE FUNNY COMPANION.</HEAD>
<P>ARLACKSMITH in a country town, while shoeing a horse, was gazed at by a number of negroes as they were passing by; being a little piqued at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the object of the blacks' attention, and attempting to cast a slur upon them, he said, "I believe hell's broke loose."—"Yes, massa," says one, "I see de devil has got hold de horse's foot."</P>
<P>A tradesman, whose love of money made him perscribe, as beneficial to his servants" health, and his own profit, the practice of early rising, one morning gave a poor black man a severe scolding for suffering the sun to shine on him while in bed—concluding his lectures with a severe threat, if he should ever after find him not up at sun rise. "At sunrise, massa?" asked the honest African, in the native simplic∣ity of his soul—it was worth a casket of dia∣monds to him—"At sunrise, massa? But sup∣pose, massa, the sun rise before day light—what shall I do den, sir?" The master made no re∣ply, and Sambo was dismissed.</P>
<P>A very pious gentleman, but rather worldly, who lives not many miles from Boston, made
<PB N="6" REF="028720_0004_0FDA61A665132278"/>it his constant practice to call up his family before day, in order that they might attend prayers, and be ready for their labour in good season: One morning having mustered his family rather earlier than common, he com∣menced family duties by prayer, during which, he returned thanks to the Lord, that they were brought to see the light of another day: An old negro standing by, cried out, "Top, top, vate a bit, no day yet, massa, sartin no day yet."</P>
<P>When the French fleet, during the late war, entered the British channel, the English fleet under f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Charles Hardy, stood away, as if bear∣ing for port; a jack tar, on board the Royal George, seeing this proceeding, went below, and bringing up his hammock, went to the head of the ship, which had the figure of George II. for its ornament—"Let me, old boy," said he, "muff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you, for damn me but it would hurt you too much to see us running away."</P>
<P>Mr. Mackenzie, who has sometimes been called the Scots Addison, is by profession an attorney. He was lately in company with sir William Howe, in the Highlands of Scotland. After dinner, the convesation happened to turn upon poison; the various effects of different species were mentioned, and among others, those of ratsbane and laurel water. "We say in England," said the general to Mr. Macken∣zie, "that ratsbane will not kill a lawyer."— "And we say in Scotland," replied the wit, "that some generals are in no danger from laurel."</P>
<P>Some years since, one Tom Hide, an Indian, famous for his cunning, went into a ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n at
<PB N="7" REF="028720_0005_0FDA61A7A709C640"/>Brookfield, in Massachusetts, and after a little talk, told the landlord, he had been hunting, had killed a fine fat deer, and that if he would give him a quart of rum, he would tell him where it was.—The landlord did not wish to let slip so good an opportunity to obtain the venison, and immediately measured the Indian his rum—"Well," says Tom, "do you know where the great meadow is?" "Yes"—"Well, do you know where the great marked maple tree that stands in it, is?"—"Yes"—"Well there lies the deer." Away posted the tavern∣er with his team, in quest of his purchase: He found the meadow and the tree; but his searchings after the deer were in vain; and he returned no heavier, but in chagrin, than he went. Some days after, he met the Indian, and violently accused him of a deception. Tom heard him out, and with the coolness of a philosopher replied, "did you find the mead∣ow, as I said?"—"Yes," "and the tree?"— "Yes"—"and the deer?"—"No."—"Ve∣ry good," continues he—"you found two truths to one li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which was very well for an Indian."</P>
<P>A certain trading justice in Boston, notori∣ous for his professional ingenuity, some time since employed a poor man to saw a load of wood, for which he agreed to give him eigh∣teen pence. The man, in order to be more ex∣peditious in the business, stripped off his coat and laid it in the street.—After finishing the job, he found, to his surprise, that the coat had vanished, and asking the justice, who had been at the door, nearly the whole time, if he had seen any thing of it—the worthy magistrate re∣plied, "he had found a coat in the street," and
<PB N="8" REF="028720_0006_0FDA61A925B50BB0"/>producing it desired to know, "if he could swear to the property;" on the poor man's an∣swering in the affirmative, he proceeded to ad∣minister the oath: After which, on restoring the coat, he shrewdly observed to the poor fel∣low, that they were now clear of each other, the price of the work being eighteen pence, and his fees amounting to the same.</P>
<P>Dr. F—, being in England in the year 1775, was asked by a nobleman, what would satisfy the Americans? He answered, that it might easily be comprised in a few re's, which he immediately wrote on a piece of paper.— Thus,

<P>Some years since, an Indian resided in the metropolis of a neighbouring state; he gained his subsistence by his industry, and being a ve∣ry handy fellow, he was frequently employed by many in the city, particularly by the gov∣ernor. The Indian, whose name was Joseph, took the liberty of enquiring of the governor, how it came to pass he had so many fine things about him and never worked any? The gov∣ernor
<PB N="9" REF="028720_0007_0FDA61AB92904DD8"/>replied that he got them by headwork. Joe wished to be instructed in the mystery, but was informed his scull was too thick for it. Some time after, Joe was sent for by the gov∣ernor, who demanded to know what he would have for killing a calf? Joe said, he would do it for two shillings: He was desired to go to the stable and perform the business; he went, cut the calf's throat, and left him lying there: after some delay he went to the house, and re∣ceived his pay: Soon after the governor went to see how his veal looked, but was astonished to find the calf lying dead, and nothing more done to it. He sent for the Indian, repri∣manded him severely for treating him so. Joe insisted that he had complied fully with his agreement; saying he had killed the calf, and that for two shillings more he would dress it, asking the governor if that was not something like headwork?</P>
<P>Some years ago, immediately after the shock of a tremendous earthquake had alarmed the inhabitants of Grenada, the conversation turn∣ed at the governor's table, upon the latent oc∣casion of the above phaenomenon; after every one of the company had assigned it to a differ∣ent cause, an old negro woman was asked, what was her opinion on the subject; she replied, "she thought the Great God was passing by, and the earth had made him a curtsy."</P>
<P>Several runaway negroes being condemn∣ed to be hanged, one was offered his life, on condition of being the executioner. He re∣fused it: he would sooner die. The master fixed on another of his slaves to perform the office. "Stay," said this last, "'till I prepare
<PB N="10" REF="028720_0008_0FDA61AEC671B820"/>myself." He instantly retired to his hut, and cut off his wrist with an axe. Returning to his master, "now," said he, "compel me, if you can, to hang my comrades."</P>
<P>During the late war, an elderly gen∣tleman from New-York, who was at bottom a staunch loyalist, but so fond of argument, that he would occasionally take up the subject of the war and argue upon it either pro or con— being once at a coffeehouse in London, when that topic was in agitation, and then defend∣ing the cause of the Americans, one of the company, more sanguine than the rest, round∣ly asserted, there could be no doubt of conquer∣ing the Americans, notwithstanding the supe∣riority of their numbers; for that one Eng∣lishman could drive an hundred of them.— Pray, do you think sir, said the Yankee, you could atchieve so noble an exploit? Perhaps not, replied the hero, upon so great a number— Could you drive fifty?—No—Could you drive twenty?—No—Could you drive one?— O yes, by G—d, I could do that easily at any time.—Then, sir, said the old gentleman, as you are an Englishman, and I am an American, if you please, drive me. The political brag∣gadocia, drew in his horns, and sneaked off.</P>
<P>Colonel Cockburn rose from a private soldier to the rank which he enjoyed when St. Eustatius was retaken.—Of this circum∣stance he was continually boasting, and upon occasions where it proved more pride than humility.—One day in the island of St. Eu∣statius, he was reviewing his troops, and took notice of a man in the ranks who was exces∣sively dirty.—Going up to him, he said, "how
<PB N="11" REF="028720_0009_0FDA61B062D24E80"/>dare you, you rascal, appear on the parade with that dirty shirt? it is as black as ink.— Did you ever see me so nasty, with such a dirty shirt, when I was a private man?"—"No, your honour, to be sure I never did," answered the man—"But then your honour will be pleased to recollect, that your honour's mother was a washer woman."</P>
<P>A person of the name of Palmer, who was a lieutenant in the tory new levies, was detected in the camp at Peek's kiln. Governor Tryon, who commanded the new levies, re∣claimed him as a British subject, represented the heinous crime of condemning a man com∣missioned by his majesty, an threatened ven∣geance in case he should be executed. Gener∣al Putnam wrote him the following pithy re∣ply:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Nathan Palmer, a lieutenant in your king's service, was taken in my camp as a spy—he was tried as a spy—he was condemned as a spy—and you may rest assured, sir, he shall be hanged as a spy. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>P. S. Afternoon—He is hanged.</P>
<P>A lady in Charleston, South Carolina, said, before one of her little girls, that Mrs. T—(a rosy widow, whom they visited in the next street) was a very good sort of a woman, and a very entertaining companion, when she had not a drop in her eye.</P>
<P>A few days after, Mrs. T— came to the house, and little Charlotte took more notice of her than she usually did. She stared in her
<PB N="12" REF="028720_0010_0FDA61B2835C84F8"/>face, indeed, in so pointed a manner, that the lady could not help being desirous of knowing, "what she saw in her countenance, to occa∣sion so critical an examination."</P>
<P>"I am looking," replied the child, with a pretty innocent voice, "to see if there is a drop in your eye."</P>
<P>A gentleman riding out one morning early in a place where he happened not to be acquainted; coming up by the side of a young woman who was carrying a pig in her arms, and hearing it scream violently, addressed her thus: "why, my dear, your child cries amaz∣ingly!" The young woman, turning round, and looking him in the face, said, with a smile upon her countenance, "I know it, sir, it al∣ways does so, when it sees its daddy."</P>
<P>As a gentleman, in a certain coffee house, was writing a letter to his friend, there being a good deal of company present, a pert young fellow posted himself behind him.— The gentleman concluded his letter with these words: I should write more, but there is an impudent puppy looking over my shoulder.— The macaroni instantly turned upon his heels, and exclaimed aloud, "I'll be d—d if I was looking over your shoulder."</P>
<P>The great Mr. Dalmahoy went in com∣pany with a friend lately to bedlam, to see the lunatics there. Among other unhappy ob∣jects, he saw a man quite naked, who called out for him to come to the grate. He did so. The madman said, come, sir, you are admiral of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fleet.—I am admiral of the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us not put our innocent men to death. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this sword, (handing him a straw)
<PB N="13" REF="028720_0011_0FDA61B66D00F348"/>and I'll take this, holding in his hand another straw. Dalmahoy took the straw, and the oth∣er throwing himself into an attitude, made several passes through the grate, which Dalma∣hoy humoured. At last the madman dropped his straw, and said, "you have disarmed me: but if you are a man of honor you will permit me to take up my sword again." Dalmahoy said, "by all means." The madman stooped, but instead of the straw, took up a large jordan, and dashed the contents in Dalmahoy's face, crying out, "there, d—n you, go and tell your king what a stinking admiral he pitched upon to fight with me."</P>
<P>A fellow who had been engaged to prove an alib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on a late trial, after declaring roundly that the prisoner was in his house at the time the robbery was commited, was asked by the counsellor for the prosecutor, whether he had not heard that the prisoner had con∣fessed his guilt? Yes, said he, gravely, but he was always a d—d lying dog.</P>
<P>A man went to see his neighbour who was ill, and sitting down by his bed side, asked him several questions concerning the state of his health; which the other, who was sudden∣ly taken speechless, could not answer. This highly offended his visitor, who was not con∣scious of the cause; and rising in a rage, told him, "that please God he would be sick him∣self soon, and when he came to see him, the d—l a word he would say to him, that noth∣ing might be lost."</P>
<P>Two chimney sweeps having a bridge to pass, where the toll for one of them amounted to all the money they could raise between
<PB N="14" REF="028720_0012_0FDA61B7B0F6D210"/>them, one of the fellows got into the foot-bag, which the other taking on his back, marched up to the gate, paid the single fare, and passed off with his load unsuspected.</P>
<P>A notorious miser, having heard a very elo∣quent charity sermon, "this sermon," said he, "strongly proves the necessity of alms; I had almost a mind to beg."</P>
<P>A young man, who has attended considera∣bly to arithmetic, and formed pretty towering ideas of his skill in that science, the other day addressed himself to an African in the follow∣ing manner: "Boston, I can take a pen and ink, and in three minutes can cypher out and tell you how many minutes you have to live." "Canna you, massa, you must be a very good cypher indeed. I aska you a question. Which can see best, a mare stone blind, or a horse without eyes?" Pho, that's no question at all." "I aske you another,—'pose he be ten rods to Nicholas's, how far you call him away out yonder?" "That I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tell neither," replied he. "Well, I aske one more," pose fifty rail make one load, how many he take to make a d—d great pile?" So many unanswerable questions quite confounded our young conceit∣ed arithmetician. He began to think he did not know every thing, and retreated from the lists of his African antagonist, with shame and confusion,</P>
<P>One of the king's soldiers in the civil wars, being full of zeal and liquor, staggered against a church, and clapping the wall of it repeated∣ly with his hand, hiccupped out, d—n you, you b—h, never fear, I'll stand by you to the last.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028720_0013_0FDA61B9A7AAFBC8"/>
A dragoon was shot in Dublin for desertion, and taking away his horse and accoutrements at the same time. When on his trial, an of∣ficer asked him what could induce him to take away his horse? To which he replied, "he ran away with him." What, said the officer, did you do with the money you sold him for? "That, please your honour," said the fellow, with the utmost indifference, "ranaway too."</P>
<P>Two friends, who had not seen each other for a long time, met one day by accident.— "How do you do?" says one, "so, so," re∣plied the other; "and yet I was married, since you and I were together."—"That is good news."—"Not very good—for it was my lot to meet with a termagant."—"It is pity."— "I hardly think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o—for she brought me two thousand pounds."—"Well, there is comfort." —"Not much—for with her fortune I pur∣chased a quantity of sheep, and they all died of the rot."—"That is indeed distressing."— "Not so distressing as you imagine—for by the sale of their skins, I got more than the sheep cost me."—"In that case you are indeminifi∣ed."—"By no means—for my house and all my money have been destroyed by fire."— "Alas! this was a dreadful misfortune."— "Faith, not so dreadful—for my termagant wife and my house were burned together."</P>
<P>The wife of a farmer, on an estate near Richmond, was taken in labour: the farmer wished for a son, and waited in the next room for the intelligence: it proved a boy, and the man jumped from his chair with ecstacy. A few minutes after, the maid servant came in,
<PB N="16" REF="028720_0014_0FDA61BCF9B65290"/>and told him her mistress was delivered of an∣other child, a fine girl: "a girl, (said the farmer with astonishment) well, well, we must endeavour to give it a bit of bread." A short while after, the girl appeared again, and told him her mistress was delivered of a lovely boy! "What, another child! (said the farm∣er, almost frantic with surprise) d—n it, Nancy, is your mistress a pigging?"</P>
<P>At the commencement of the late revolu∣tion, when the French nation appeared in∣clined to take part in the contest in favour of America, sir Joseph Yorke, the ambassador from England to the United Netherlands, meeting the French ambassador at the Hague, censured his court for interfering in the dis∣pute, and taking so ungenerous a part: "You have been guilty of a dishonourable act (said he) that is unpardonable—no less than that of debauching our daughter." "I am sorry (replied the French Ambassador) that your excellency should put such a severe construc∣tion upon the matter: She made the first ad∣vances, and absolutely threw herself into our arms; but, rather than forfeit your friendship, if matrimony will make any atonement, we are ready to act honourably, and marry her."</P>
<P>When George Whitfield first came to Charleston in South Carolina, the Rev. Alex∣ander Garden was episcopal minister of that place. Not liking Whitfield's principles, he took occasion to preach a sermon against him from the following text,—"Behold, those that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also."—In the afternoon of the same day, Whitfield, in his turn, retorted upon his
<PB N="17" REF="028720_0015_0FDA61BEE69580A0"/>antagonist to a very crowded audience, and with all the wit and satire for which he was so remarkable, from these words of St. Paul, "Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil, the Lord reward him according to his works."—Soon after, Garden, not to be outdone, took occasion to declaim with some heat, against the light and trifling tunes used in Whitfield's church, as being too theatrical and gay for holy worship, and such as had been long appropriated to prophane songs and airs—"Very true, doctor, said Whitfield in his next lecture: but pray, sir, can you assign any good reason why the devil should always be in possession of the best tunes?"</P>
<P>Some officers of the army who had served during the American war, walking in Hyde Park, dressed in their regimentals, met a man deformed by a haunch on his back, when one of them jocularly clapping his hand thereon, exclaimed, "What have you got here, my friend?" To which the other, with a coun∣tenance expressive of the insult, replied, "Bunker's hill—damn your red coat."</P>
<P>At the opening of one of the courts of law in Massachusetts, lately, a clergyman was sent for to address the Deity—a gentleman present observed, that although this was ever the laudable practice, at the supreme judicial court, these courts had never, in his memory, opened with prayer. A sailor, who heard the last remark, observed to his mess mate, "If so, Jack, I believe as how the ship is really in distress, since they pipe all hands, and now call the parson to his quarters."</P>

General Morgan, with eight hundred men, of whom one half were militia, completely beat, at the battle of the Cowpens, colonel Tarleton, who attacked him with one thousand regular troops.—Two hundred dragoons of that colonel, were put to flight, and briskly pursued by sixty Americans, under colonel Washington. Some months afterwards, Tar∣leton, being in the house of a farmer, spoke with much vanity of himself, and lightly of colonel Washington, saying "he wished much to see his face." "It is a pity then," replied a girl in the house, "that colonel Tarleton did not take the pains to turn his head at Cow∣pens."</P>
<P>In the western expedition of 1758, general Forbes, who commanded it, was, by his infirmi∣ties, reduced so low as to be taken up in a lit∣ter.—The Indians, who saw him, were aston∣ished that a warrior could not walk:—this so disgusted them at their commander, that they remonstrated against him. Their old friend, colonel Weiser, to appease them, made this sagacious reply: "This man is so terrible in war, that we are obliged to confine him, and let him write his orders; for if he was let loose on the world, he would deluge it with blood."</P>
<P>A negro had so cruel a master, that he dread∣ed the very sight of him. After exercising a variety of tyrannical acts among his slaves, the tyrant at last died, and left his son heir to his estates. Some time after his death a gentleman meeting the negro, asked him how his master behaved; I suppose, says he, he is a chip of the old block. No, no, says the negro, Masta be all block himself.</P>

The noted Tom Bell, while on Longisland, passed part of the time by the name of Brandt Schuyler, an alderman of Newyork—a custom of passing by other men's names being very common to him. Some time after his pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing by the said Schuyler's name, he was tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n up for some crime he had commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and brought to the gaol at Newyork. Curiosity was such with men in general, to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a person, that many visited him while in confinement▪ Among the rest was brandt Schuyler, who af∣ter a variety of questions, asked him, whether what he heard was true, namely, that you, Mr. Bell, have passed in Longisland by my name? Upon which Bell answered, "Yes, I passed by your name, but as I never was able to get even a drink of buttermilk by it, I soon left it off, and am determined to make use of it no more." This so confounded the alderman, that he made no reply, but walked off immediately—after which he was called the "buttermilk Alder∣man."</P>
<P>A fellow being stopped with four hogs that he had stolen, attempted to make his escape, but running into a bye road, through which there was no passage, he was taken and lodged in gaol. "Damn it, said he, as he entered, I have brought my hogs to a fine market."</P>
<P>A lady, celebrated in Scotland for her wit and beauty, happening to be at an assembly in Edinburgh, a young gentleman, the son of his majesty's print<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, who had the patent for pub∣lishing bibles, made his appearance dressed in green and gold. Being a new face, and ex∣tremely elegant, he attracted the attention of the whole company. A general murmur pre∣vailed
<PB N="20" REF="028720_0018_0FDA61C4E87763E8"/>in the room, to learn who he was; the lady instantly made answer loud enough to be heard, "Oh! don't you know him? it is young Bible, <HI>bound in calf and gilt—but not letter∣ed.</HI>"</P>
<P>When the amiable dutchess of Northumber∣land was some years ago on the continent, she stopped at an inn in French Flanders, at the Golden Goose; but arriving late, and being somewhat fatigued with her journey, she or∣dered but a slight repast for herself and her suite, which consisted of only five servants. In the morning, when the landlord presented his bill, her secretary was much surprised at one general item of "Expences for the night, 14 louis d'ors." In vain did he remonstrate; the artful Fleming knew the generous charac∣ter of the dutchess, and was positive. The money was accordingly paid. When she was preparing to depart, the landlord, as usual, at∣tended her to the carriage; and after making many congees, and expressing many thanks, he hoped he would have the honor of her grace's company on her return. "Why, I don't know but you may," said the dutchess, with her usual good humour; "but it must be upon one condition, that you do not mistake me a∣gain for your sign."</P>
<P>A lady being ill, sent for a physician, and on his leaving the room gave him a see of two guineas. This she repeated several times, but one day she gave him a single guinea. This by some accident fell upon the floor, when the doctor picked it up, and turning to the lady, with a significant look, said, "Madam, I be∣lieve I have dropt a guinea." "No, doctor,
<PB N="21" REF="028720_0019_0FDA61CAD2DC27D0"/>replied the lady smartly, 'Twas I who dropt the guinea."</P>
<P>A lady on the wrong side of fifty, having lost both her money and temper at a rout, with very little grace, had the additional misfortune in stooping, to lose her entire head dress, to the discovery of a bald pate; whereupon one of the company observed in her hearing, "That he could not but commend the HAIR, for leaving so weak a HEAD!"</P>
<P>An honest clergyman in the country was re∣proving a married couple for their frequent dissentions, which were very unbecoming, both in the eye of God and man, seeing that you are both ONE: "Both one! cried the hus∣band, were you to come by our door sometimes when we quarrel, you would swear we were TWENTY."</P>
<P>A large party of gentlemen were invited to dinner at a gentleman's house. It so happened that one of the party was overheard to say to another, "Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them." The gentleman took it up immediately, and said, "Wise men make proverbs, and fools repeat them."</P>
<P>A young member in the house of commons was tempted to display his oratorial powers, by the success and applause with which some eloquent members were attended; accordingly on a certain subject he rose up with great im∣portance, and said, "Mr. Speaker, have we laws, or have we not laws? If we have laws, and they are not obeyed, to what end were these laws made?" After he was seated some time, another member arose and said, "Mr. Speaker, did the honorable gentleman who
<PB N="22" REF="028720_0020_0FDA61CDE5679B78"/>spoke last, speak to the purpose, or did he not speak to the purpose? If he did not speak to the purpose, to what purpose did he speak?</P>
<P>The following story is related of a gentle∣man who had no nose: As he was walking along the street one day, a beggar woman fol∣lowed him, saying, God preserve your eyesight, Master? Why so, good woman? said he. Be∣cause, sir, said she, if you should grow dim∣sighted, your honor would have no place to hang your spectacles on.</P>
<P>The brave, but eccentric general Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had so little regard to the rules of politeness and civili∣ty, that he always spoke his opinions unreserv∣edly, without regarding the offence or pain they might excite. Being one night at Alba∣ny, drinking with an old Scotch officer, when he began to mellow with the wine, he told his companion that he had one fault, which he begged him to overlook, which was to abuse the Scotch when he was in liquor. In troth, replied the officer, I shall readily fogive your fault, if you will overlook mine; it is when I hear any person impertinently abusing Scot∣land or Scotchmen, when I am drunk or sober, I cannot refrain from laying my cane soundly over his shoulders. Now I will readily par∣don your fault, if you will pardon mine. This seasonable hint made the general very polite the remainder of the night.</P>
<P>During the late war, there lived in New Jersey, a remarkable dwarf. Though upwards of twenty years old, he was not more than three feet high, and every way small in pro∣portion. This curiosity drew great crouds of people to see him, and amongst the rest, gener∣al
<PB N="23" REF="028720_0021_0FDA61CF654C5700"/>Washington. The nero conversed some time with Tommy Thumb; asked several ques∣tions; and generally received pertinent an∣swers. The general wished to know his po∣litical sentiments, and asked whether he was whig or tory? "I cannot say, sir," said this man of might: "I have not yet taken an ac∣tive part."</P>
<P>Soon after the Massachusetts insurgents re∣treated from their attack on general Shepard, at Ordnance hill, and when it was hourly ex∣pected they would renew it, Shays sent a flag to general Shepard, requesting him to have de∣livered to him the bodies of the killed, amount∣ing to five. The officer, who had been sent by general Shepard, to receive the flag, on the re∣quest being made for five slain, with the ut∣most sang froid imaginable replied, "Present general Shepard's compliments to captain Shays: and inform him, that he cannot fur∣nish him with five dead, he having no more than four: But that if captain Shays will please to attack him again, he will then furnish him with another, and as many more as he shall desire."</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin, as agent for the province of Pennsylvania, being in England at the time the parliament passed the stamp act for Amer∣ica, was frequently applied to by the ministry for his opinion respecting the operation of the same, and assured them that the people of A∣merica would never submit to it. The act was nevertheless passed, and the event shewed he had been right. After the news of the de∣struction of the stamped paper had arrived in England, the ministry again sent for the doc∣tor,
<PB N="24" REF="028720_0022_0FDA61D144AB4448"/>to consult with him, and conclude with this proposition, that if the Americans would engage to pay for the damage done in the de∣struction of the stamped paper, &amp;c. the parlia∣ment would then repeal the act. To this the doctor answered, that it put him in mind of a Frenchman, who having heated a poker red hot, ran into the street, and addressing an En∣glishman he met there, "hah, monsieur, voulez vous give me de plaisir et de satisfaction, and lete me runi dis poker only one foote up your backside?" "What!" says the Englishman:— "Only to lete me runi dis poker one foote up your backside." Damn your soul," replies the Englishman. "Welle, den, only so far," says the Frenchman, pointing to about six inch∣es of the poker.—"No, no," replies the En∣glishman—"damn your soul; what do you mean?" "Well, den, says the Frenchman, will you have de justice to paye me for de trouble and expence of heating de poker?"— "dam me, if I do," answered the Englishman, and walked off.</P>
<P>A member of the general court of Massa∣chusetts, who, from accustoming himself to take a nap after dinner, when at home, could not dispense with the custom, when attending to give laws to a mighty people, not long since occasioned much sport in the house, by the following incident. A day was assigned for the second reading of a lumber act: As this interested our sleeper, he requested a friend, who sat next him, to awaken him, if the dis∣cussion of the bill should be introduced, while he was asleep. This his friend promised him: But, happening to go out for a few minutes,
<PB N="25" REF="028720_0023_0FDA61D32A6856A8"/>the bill was called for; and after a short de∣bate, was committed. Immediately after, the bill for preventing fornication was brought forward. This occasioned some debate, dur∣ing which the sleeper's friend returned. Find∣ing the lumber bill was dismissed, he thought he might indulge his friend in his nap. How∣ever, as ill luck would have it, he trod upon the toe of this votary to Morpheus, who sup∣posed it a signal for waking: immediately rousing himself, he rubbed his eyes, and look∣ing about, perceived a pause in the debate— on which he arose and addressed the speaker as follows: "Sir, I wish to speak a few words on the bill now in question. It affects, Mr. Speaker, my constituents very much; for <HI>above half of our town get their living by it.</HI></P>
<P>A certain lady of quality spoke to her But∣ler to be very saving of a cask of excellent small beer, and asked him how it could be best preserved—The butler replied, "By placing a barrel of good ale by it."</P>
<P>Mr. Quin happening to call at a friend's house near Bath, which was not quite finished, found only the servant at home; however, Quin being rather hard pressed in a certain way, told the fellow to shew him the little∣house; "Yes, sir, said the servant, the house is little, but it is very compact."—"I mean, said Quin, your necessary house."—"I believe, sir, said the servant, when my master comes down, he will find it very necessary, and much pre∣ferable to lodgings." Quin was almost out of all patience, and exclaimed, "Tis your con∣veniency I mean, sir." "Yes, sir; I can assure you, sir, as I said before, tho' small, it is very
<PB N="26" REF="028720_0024_0FDA61D4A57FABA0"/>convenient." "You rascal, you," says Quin, "'Tis your s—t house, I mean, and if you don't shew it me directly, I shall foul my breeches." Oh lord, Sir, said the servant, that is not built yet.</P>
<P>As a certain clergyman who shall be name∣less, was performing divine service in his par∣ish church, on the coast of Essex, where is a variety of shipwrecks, and where the people are well known to be very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of plunder; it so happened that the alarm was given of A WRECK! A WRECK! with which the con∣gregation were much more <HI>moved</HI> than with the parson's sermon; he perceiving it, opened the pulpit door, walked down stairs, and begged they would stay to hear five words more, which he had to say: the people consenting, the parson said, <HI>Let us all start fair.</HI></P>
<P>An old lady, who was not very much famed for good breeding and politeness, whatever oth∣er quality she might possess, being in a large party of very genteel company, happened to break wind backwards—a young gentleman who sat near her, seeing the company observe it, took the shame upon himself, and apologiz∣ed very modestly for the rudeness he had been guilty of. It passed very well, and the next day the lady sent him a pair of colours, with her compliments, and this remark, "That it was an ill wind that blew nobody good."</P>

<P>In the northern exertions last war, for raising men to serve his British majesty, it was too customary for the Lairds and Highland chiefs to compel their vassals into the service by main force, when they would not go by fair means.— A little disturbance of this sort happening one day, and a crowd ensuing, a person stopt to ask what was the matter?

<P>When the British and American armies were near each other in the neighbourhood of Germantown, five Hessian soldiers, who had straggled into the woods, and lost their way, were met by an Irishman, who was a private in general Washington's army: He immediately presented his piece, and desired them to sur∣render; they supposing that he was supported by a party, did as he directed, and threw down their arms. He then marched them before him to the American lines, and brought them to head quarters. General Washington won∣dered at the spirit and atchievement of the fel∣low, and asked him, how he, a single man, could capture five? Why, says the Irishman, Please your excellency, by Jasus I surrounded them!—The General laughed heartily, gave him a sum of money, and promoted him to a halbert.</P>

Some time since, a person on his travels through Coventry, in the state of Connecticut, stopped at the house of the Rev. Joseph Hunt∣ington, D. D. and acquainted the doctor, that he had been preaching at Susquehannah for a considerable time, but was so unfortunate as to be driven from his possessions by the Indians, who had destroyed his property. He added that he was on his way to Massachusetts, where he had some friends, and asked charity of the doctor. The latter was liberal and hospitable to the stranger, and told him as it was Satur∣day, and it would be improper for him to tra∣vel on the Sabbath, he might refresh himself at his house both days. The offer was accept∣ed; and Dr. Huntington invited his guest to assist him next day in the duties of his func∣tion; but he declined, alledging as a reason, that his cloths were not sufficiently decent to appear in the pulpit. To obviate this diffi∣culty, the doctor offered him a suit of clothes almost new. The objection being removed, the pretended clergyman agreed to assist his brother, and, in order to prepare himself, de∣sired to be left alone that evening, to study his discourse. A sire was accordingly made in his bed chamber, whither he repaired with his new garb, at the same time acquainting the doctor, that he must study till late at night, and hoped no noise he might make would dis∣turb the repose of the family. Sunday morn∣ing came, and the <HI>preacher</HI> being sent for to breakfast, was not to be found. He had de∣camped in the night, <HI>a la fourdine,</HI> and carried off the clothes, so well suited to his newly as∣sumed clerical dignity, leaving behind him the
<PB N="29" REF="028720_0027_0FDA61DCE6F2DB10"/>following apposite text, written at the top of the paper, intended for his discourse, "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me, and where I am, thither ye cannot come." John vii. 34.</P>
<P>A mad man having broke from confinement, was parading through the streets of Boston, with a loaded musket, which he had seized, and swearing that he would kill the first man that attempted to stop him. Governor Leveret ad∣vancing towards him, accosted him thus, "Ho, brother soldier, have you learned your exer∣cise?'—He answered, "Yes," "Then stand to your arms, while I give the word of com∣mand'." The man seemed pleased, and stood bolt upright, with his gun shouldered. The Governor then began—"Poise your firelock; rest your firelock—order your firelock; ground your firelock." The man obeved. "Face to the right about; march." As soon as he began to step, the Governor advanced, took up his gun, and beckoning to the bystanders, they in∣stantly seized him, and carried him to the place of confinement.</P>

<P>Soon after Sir William Johnson had been appointed superintendant of Indian affairs in America, he wrote to England for some suits of clothes, richly laced. When they arrived, HENDRICK, king of the Mohawk nation, was present, and particularly admired them. In a few succeeding days, Hendrick called on Sir William, and acquainted him that he had had a dream. On Sir William's enquiring what it was, he told him that he had dreamed that he had given him one of those fine suits he had lately received. Sir William took the hint, and immediately presented him with one of the richest suits. The Indian chief, highly

Some time after this, Sir William, happening to be in company with Hendrick, told him, that he had also had a dream. Hen∣drick being very solicitous to know what it was, Sir William informed him, that he had dreamed that he (Hendrick) had made him a present of a particular tract of land (the most valuable on the Mohawk river) of about 5000 acres. Hendrick presented him with the land immediately, but not without making this shrewd remark: "Now, Sir William, I will never dream with you again, you dream too hard for me."</P>

A famous painter agreed beforehand, for the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a picture with a gentleman, who was not indebted to Nature, either for shape or face; the picture being finished, the gentle∣man endeavoured to beat down the price, al∣leging that if he did not purchase it, it would lie on the painter's hands. "That is your mistake, says the painter, for I can sell it for double the price I demand." "How can that be?" says the gentleman, "for it is like nobody but myself." "True," replied the painter, "but I will draw a tail to it, (that is the time it will fetch me double) for, then it will make an excellent monkey." The gen∣tleman, to prevent being exposed, paid down the money demanded, and carried off the picture.</P>
<P>During the march of a detachment of the American army, through New-Jersey, in the late war, a silver spoon was missed in a house where a party of the troops had been billeted.</P>
<P>Suspicion pitched on a soldier, who was seen to have entered the apartment where the spoon was kept—and he was accused of the theft:</P>
<P>"May I never meet salvation"—exclaimed the soldier—"May I be sunk into the endless regions of perdition, if I have seen—heard of —or taken your spoon,"</P>
<P>"But no one else could have taken it," re∣plied the host.</P>
<P>The soldier again went through the "man∣ual" of his attestations of innocence—and im∣precations against himself if he was guilty.</P>
<P>The landlord looked astonished—and being an honest man, was obliged to believe the
<PB N="40" REF="028720_0038_0FDA61F9512C02E8"/>soldier—but just on the point to leave the ex∣amination—he, taking hold of the button of the soldier's coat, and looking him in the face— said—"Now say upon your honour, that you have not got my spoon—and I shall be satis∣fied." "Upon my honor," said the soldier to himself, after thinking for a few minutes— "Upon my honor"—Poh! blast you, he cried—pulling the spoon from his pocket, and giving it to its owner—"Blast your spoon— take your spoon and be d—d."</P>
<P>The host stared with surprise—and while lamenting that the great principles of mo∣rality, should have less weight in the mind of an intelligent being, than the principles of what he conceived to be a mere sound—the soldier swung his knapsack, and joining the corps, marched off.</P>

<P>A clergyman in New-Jersey, owned a negro by the name of Quash, who was by no means fond of working, and one day told his master he conceived it a hardship, "dai he poor ne∣gar man mus worke so hard, and massa do nothing." You are mistaken Quash, my la∣bour is more fatiguing than your's; I do head work, and your's is merely bodily exercise. This hint was sufficient for Quash. The next day he was ordered into the woods to procure fuel—but Quash staying longer than usual, the

When he enquired the cause, Quash starting up and rubbing his midnight brow, oh! massa me— me have been doing head work.—Well let me hear what your head has done.—Suppose massa, dere be five pigeons on dis tree, and you take a gun and soot two of dem, how many dere be left?

<P>Dr. P. an Irish parson and a remarkably or∣dinary man in his person, having a neat par∣sonage house very conveniently furnished, was one day shewing it to dr. Berkly, the celebrated bishop of Cloyne. "Well, my lord," says the doctor, after they had returned to the dining parlour, "you see what a nice marriage trap I have got here," "Why, yes doctor," says the bishop, looking him full in the face, "I see you have; but I am afraid you will not find a lady that will relish the bait."</P>
<P>The late excellent wit, counsellor Crips of Cork, who, from a very fine beau, dwindled into a mere sloven as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advanced in years, was invited by lady Doneraile to dinner at her country house. Her ladyship, knowing his inattention to dress, told him in the card, that the first personages in the neighbourhood of Doneraile were to dine with her, and request∣ed he would be very spruce on the occasion. But the request had no effect upon the coun∣sellor; he appeared before her ladyship in an old rusty black coat and waistcoat, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="42" REF="028720_0040_0FDA61FEB5F27C60"/>of greasy velvet breeches; which so disgusted her that she lectured him pretty smartly: "If I had not told you," says her ladyship, "in my card, that I expected a brilliant company to dinner, I should not be angry, but I remember I made it a particular request to see you de∣cently dressed; instead of which this old coat (taking hold of it) is not fit for a beggar; and the front of your waistcoat begrimed with the nastiest greasy velvet breeches I ever beheld: for shame, counsellor!" "Stop," says the wit; "my coat and waistcoat are old to be sure, and should be thrown aside; but my velvet breeches I have the utmost veneration for,—they are an old pall I carry to cover a dead friend."</P>
<P>When the distinguished duellist, George Robert Fitzgerald, was in Paris, the English ambassador introduced him to the French king; prior to which introduction, the ambassador informed his majesty, Mr. Fitzgerald was a man of such a mighty prowess, that he had fought thirty duels, and behaved equally brave and honorable in them all. "Then, I think," says the king with a smile, "this gentleman's life would make an admirable appendix to your renowned countryman's history, JACK the GIANT KILLER,"</P>
<P>Miss Hamilton, a maid of honour to the em∣press Catharine, wife to Peter the Great, had an amour, which, at different times, produced three children. She had always pleaded si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k∣ness; but Peter, being suspicious, ordered his physician to attend her, who soon made the discovery. It also appeared that a sense of
<PB N="43" REF="028720_0041_0FDA61FF65CE15D8"/>shame had triumphed over her humanity, and that the children had been put to death as soon as born—Peter enquired if the father of them was privy to the murder; the lady insist∣ed that he was innocent, for she had always deceived him, by pretending they were sent to nurse.—Justice now called upon the emperor to punish the offence. The lady was much beloved by the empress, who pleaded for her. —The armour was pardonable, but not the murder. Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r sent her to the castle, and went himself to visit her; and the fact being confess∣ed, he pronounced her sentence with tears; telling her, that his duty, as a prince, and God's vicegerent, called on him for that justice which her crime had rendered indispensably necessary, and that she must, therefore, pre∣pare for death. He attended her also to the scaffold, where he embraced her with the ut∣most tenderness, mixed with sorrow; and some say, that when the head was struck off, he took it up by the ear, whilst the lips were still trembling, and kissed them: a circum∣stance of an extraordinary nature, and yet not incredible, considering the particularities of his character.</P>
<P>The most wonderful ancedote, perhaps, in the world of letters, is the following.

A country attorney happened to be at a tav∣ern with an honest peasant, and was very facetious at the countryman's expense. They nevertheless agreed to try for a bottle of wine who could make the best rhyme.

The fellow waited for no further reply, but flew out of the bed with the violence of a man in fits, burst open the door, tumbled down stairs in the dark, and awaked the landlord with the noise, who de∣manded what was the matter.—"Matter," cri∣ed the farmer, "by all the devils in hell, I have been put to bed with the hangman, and never discovered it till this instant; is this the way you use strangers; for God's sake open the door and let me get into the street."

As soon as the duke cast his eyes on him, he spoke thus: "I know thy business, friend, thou art sent to take away my life. What hurt have I done thee? It is now in my power, with a word, to have thee cut to pieces before my face. But I pardon thee, go thy way and see my face no more." The gentleman, stung with his own guilt, and astonished at the excellent nature of this prince, fell on his knees, confessed his design, and who employed him; but fearing to tarry in France, he immediately departed the kingdom, and entered himself into the ser∣vice of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>The emperor Charles V. having one day lost his way a hunting in a forest, and being pretty far distant from his company, found himself, after wandering about some time, near an inn, which he entered to refresh himself. Being seated, he saw four men, whose appearance
<PB N="58" REF="028720_0056_0FDA6221327A3208"/>boded him no good; however, he took no notice, but ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed for what he wanted. These men at first were lying down and pretended to sleep. But one soon rose up, and approaching the emperor, told him, that he had dreamt he ought to take away his hat, and in saying so snatched it from him. A second then came to him, say∣ing he had dreamt that his sourtout would fit him very well, and took that from him. A third cast his eye upon his buff jacket, and stript him of it. The fourth dreamt likewise in his turn, and tells the prince not to take it amiss, if he gave himself the trouble to search him, and seeing a gold chain about his neck, to which hung a flagelet, he went to take it from him: stay, my friend, said the emperor to him, before you rob me of this dear little toy, suffer me to shew you the properties of it, and at the same time he began to whistle. His at∣tendants who had sought for him throughout the forest, happily arrived near the inn, and on hearing the sound, went in, and were much surprized to see him in that condition. "Be∣cause, said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e emperor, on seeing them, this set of people—have dreamt just what they pleased, I too am disposed to dream in my turn; and having dosed a little, he said to his attendants, I have dreamt that those gentlemen, the dreamers, all four deserve the gallows: and it is my will that it be fulfilled immedi∣ately." They accordingly hanged them all four directly opposite the inn.</P>
<P>When Cromwell was in Scotland with his troops, he went out one morning to see the country, with only a few guards: A Scotch
<PB N="59" REF="028720_0057_0FDA6222A9108ED8"/>soldier coming, to make himself remarkable by doing some great deed, fired at him from be∣hind a dyke; but having missed his aim, Cromwell's guards were going to seize and kill him.

<P>Lord Townshend, when young, being at the battle of Dettingen, as he was marching down pretty close to the enemy, was so very thought∣ful (as is usual with most officers on their first battle,) that he took no notice of a drummer's head that was sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> off just before him, though he received some of the brains on his coat. A ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eran officer observing this, went up to him, and endeavoured to rouse him, by telling him
<PB N="60" REF="028720_0058_0FDA622654CA6728"/>the best way in these cases was not to think at all. "Oh! dear sir, says his lordship, with great presence of mind, you entirely mistake my reverie; I have been only thinking what the devil could bring this little drummer here, who seems to possess such a quantity of brains."</P>

<P>James the first, when he was duke of York, took it into his head to visit Milton, merely out of curiosity. In the course of their con∣versation, the duke asked Milton, "Whether he did not think the loss of his sight was a judgment upon him for what he had written against his father, Charles the first?" The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣mortal bard made the following reply. "If your highness thinks, that the calamities which befall us here, are indications of the wrath of heaven; in what manner are we to account for the fate of the king, your father? The displeasure of heaven must, upon this suppo∣sition, have been much greater against him than me, for I have only lost my eyes; but he lost his head."</P>

<P>The whimsical and immortal author of Tris∣tram Shandy, was married to Mrs. Sterne on a Saturday morning: His parishoners had time∣ly notice of this circumstance, and knowing he would preach the next morning at his parish church, and desirous at the same time of seeing the bride, they assembled in such crouds, that the church was full, before the bell was done tolling. The bride, as was before expected, made her appearance, and the country folks indulged themselves with the usual observa∣tions, till Sterne mounted the pulpit; then every ear was ready to catch the words of his text, which turned out, to their astonishment, to be the following: "WE HAVE TOILED ALL NIGHT, AND HAVE CAUGHT NO FISH." The congregation looked at each other, some smil∣ed, others stopped their mouths with their handkerchiefs to prevent them from laughing, while the old folks wore very serious faces, and thought the humourist a very odd sort of fish for a pulpit lecturer: However, they at∣tended to his discourse, which turned out, as usual, very instructive; and all went home ve∣ry highly delighted with the text, but poor Mrs. Sterne, who blushed down to the finger's ends every step of the way to her house.</P>

De∣sirous one day to cut his way shorter, Mr. Hume took it into his head to pass over a temporary one, which had been erected for general accommodation, till the new one could be completed. Unfortunately, part of the temporary one gave way, and our illustrious philosopher found himself stuck in the mud. On hearing him call aloud for assistance, an old woman hastened to the spot, from whence the found seemed to proceed; but perceiving who he was, refused giving him any help. "Why, (cried she) are you not Hume, the atheist?" "Oh no! no! no! (returned the philosopher) I am no atheist! indeed you mistake, good woman, you do indeed!" "Let me hear then (returned the woman) if you can say the be∣lief."—Mr. Hume accordingly began the words, I believe in God, &amp;c. and finished them with so much propriety, that the old wo∣man, convinced of his christian education, charitably afforded him that relief, which otherwise she would have thought it a duty of religion to deny him.</P>

<P>Santeuil having a confessional dress on, ei∣ther to say vespers, or to muse upon some pro∣duction, a lady, who took him for a confessor, threw herself upon her knees, and recounted all her sins. The poet muttered something to himself, and the good penitent thinking he was reproaching her for her wickedness, hast∣ened the conclusion of her confession; when she found the consessor quite silent, she then asked him for absolution. "What, do you take me for a priest?" said Santueil. "Why then," said the lady, quite alarmed, "did you listen to me?" "And why,' replied Santeuil, "did you speak to me?" "I'll this instant go and complain of you to your prior," said the enraged female. "And I," said the poet, "am going to your husband to give him a full ac∣count of your conduct."</P>

<P>A counsellor of Grenada having refused to pay the sum of one hundred pistoles for an im∣age of St. Antonio de Padua, which Cano, a Spanish artist, had made for him. The coun∣sellor astonished at the price demanded, began to compute how many pistoles per day Cano had earned whilst the work was in hand: you have been five and twenty days carving this image of St. Antonio, said the niggardly arith∣metician, and the purchase money demanded being one hundred, you have rated your la∣bour at the exorbitant rate of four pistoles per day, whilst I, who am a counsellor, and your superior, do not make half your profits by my talents!—Wretch, cried the enraged artist, to talk to me of your talents—I have been fifty years learning to make this image in twenty∣five days, and so saying, he flung it with the utmost violence upon the pavement. The affrighted counsellor escaped out of the house, with the utmost precipitation, concluding that the man who was bold enough to demolish a saint, would have very little remorse in de∣stroying a lawyer.</P>

<P>A dispute which happened some time since about a box at the opera house in Paris, occa∣sioned a suit before the tribunal of the marchals of France: This tribunal receives complaints against military men upon affairs of honour, and in all cases in which military officers are accused of having behaved in a manner unbe∣coming gentlemen. A young clerical buck of distinguished birth, had taken one of the box∣es at the opera house. A marechal of France had set his heart upon the same box, and re∣quested that the Abbe would resign it to him: This the latter peremtorily refused to do; up∣on which the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>echal had recourse to violent measures, and took by force what he could not obtain by fair means. The Abbe, in order to obtain satisfaction for the affront that had been put upon him, lodged a complaint against the marechal, in the court of the marechals of France, and petitioned that he might be per∣mitted
<PB N="67" REF="028720_0065_0FDA623AA73E43C0"/>to speak in person in support of his charge. The prayer of the petitioner was readily granted.—He began by expressing his high sense of the honour he enjoyed in being permitted to plead before so illustrious an as∣sembly; at the same time that he felt uncom∣mon concern that he had been obliged, in vin∣dication of his own honour, to bring a charge against a person who had the honour of being a member of the court: He rejoiced, however, when he reflected, that they were too just and too equitable to refuse him justice, even against one of their own brethren. He did not think proper at first to name the accused in his speech, but took an effectual way of mortisying the general, by shewing which of the marechals was not the accused, and by mentioning the most memorable exploits of each. "It is not, (said he) of marechal such an one that I com∣plain; it is not of marechal Broglio, who so gloriously distinguished himself in the last German war; it is not marechal Clermont Tonnerre, who has rendered his name so fa∣mous by the most masterly retreats; it is not marechal de Contades, so renowned for his victories; it is not marechal de Richeliou, who took Minorca: He of whom I complain, never took a place in his whole life but my box at the opera house," and here he named the accused. The lords Generals by no means ex∣pected so severe a conclusion; they were sur∣prised, and at the same time not displeased at it: After a short deliberation they resolved that the Abbe had just grounds of complaint; but that the court, thinking he had obtained
<PB N="68" REF="028720_0066_0FDA623D3B7567B0"/>sufficient satisfaction by the turn he had given to his arguments, and the severe and witty conclusion of his speech, would not condemn the accused to any further punishment than he had already suffered from the satirical turn of the accused.</P>

<P>A rich and covetous counsellor of this king∣dom, that had an only child, which was a daughter, and worth twenty thousand pounds, a young handsome gentleman of good birth, though of no great fortune, yet had so far in∣finuated himself into the young lady's favour, that she had promised him marriage, if he could get her father's consent. Immediately he comes for London, and goes to her father, and told him, That he would give him ten pounds for a fee, if he could assist him in a business which did much concern him; which was, That there was a rich young heiress in town, which had promised him marriage, if it could any way be made good in law. Why, says he, let her hire a horse, and invite you to take her away, and let her get up before, and you behind, that it may not be said that you rode away with her, but she with you: and let her go to the minister, and tell him, it is her desire to be married to you, and so get a license accordingly; and when you are marri∣ed, then be sure to bed, and I'll warrant you she is your own. And this, says the gentle∣man, you will avouch for law? He told him, Yes. Well, Sir, says he, if you will set your hand to it, I'll give you ten pounds more; which he did. Immediately he goes into the country, and shews the young lady what was done, and how it was done; and she according∣ly performed her promise, and suddenly mar∣ried and bedded; and so having continued a

The lawyer fearing his repu∣tation might be brought into question, and see∣ing him to be a handsome and well bred gen∣tleman, and of a good family, clapt both their hands together, and said, God bless you: And then gave them a subsistence for the present, and made over all to them after his death.</P>
<P>A strange gentleman being much necessitat∣ed for a house of office in the city, and being unacquainted, went into an Upholsterer's shop, and bid him shew him a close stool; Then he shewed him one: What, says he, have you no better? Yes, say he, all of coloured velvet. Go, says he, fetch me two or three down. In the mean time he lets down his breeches, and sat down: The Upholsterer coming down, and seeing him in that posture, asked him what he was doing? Why, truly, says he, I am trying of it. And plucking up his breeches again, said, he did not like any of them, for they were all too low for him, and so went out of doors.</P>

<P>An apothecary in Oxford spoke to a coun∣tryman, by way of jeer, to bring him some live rats, and he would give him eighteen pence a piece for them: About a fortnight afterwards he brought them; and the apothe∣cary told him he was provided the day before.

I am unwilling (seeing I have brought them) to carry them back again; and told him, he would take the money out in physick, at some time or other; and so opened his bag, and let them about the shop, where they did so whisk up and down the shelves, that in a little space they broke him about forty pots and glasses, and could never get rid of them since.</P>
<P>A fellow was accused before a justice for calling a woman whore: The justice asked him why he did so?

Indeed, Sir, says she, I did often call upon him for it; nay, called him rogue too, because he would not pay me. Why then, says the justice, do you think him a rogue? Yes, truly, Sir, says she, to aggravate the matter, he is a very rogue. Nay, says the justice, then it is pity that a rogue and a whore should be part∣ed, and so sent them both to prison together: Then they both entreated him. Nay, says the justice, confess and be hanged; and so sent them both a way.</P>

<P>A notable fellow, as it is said, that would not be drunk above seven days in the week; and when he was drunk, was so besotted that he knew not what he did: Once his 'prentice was sent by his wife to fetch him home, and when he found him out, he found him reeling ripe also.

<P>A precise woman undertook to chastise her daughter, and charged her to look no more upon men; but instead of that, when you are in their company, you must still look upon the ground.

Well, says he, I'll go to the Judge, and tell him that you were condemned before for perjury, but now I'll indite thee for cozenage.

Nay, that's a lie, says the boy; for God made them bulls, but my father made them oxen.

It happened that an ignorant German came thither, and having (for his better progress in his degree he hoped to take) invited the doctor or the chair to supper; the German being a little flustered, asked the doctor, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would take money to make his horse a doctor too? Yes, says he, I may make a horse a doctor, as well as an ass; and so by consequence, your horse as well as yourself.</P>

<P>In Ireland a bagpiper coming for England with a knapsack on his shoulder, as he was sitting at dinner in a wood, three wolves be∣gan to accost him; then he threw one bread, and another meat, and still they crept nearer to him: Upon which, being afraid, he took his bagpipes and began to play, at which noise the wolves ran away. A pox take you, says he, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I had known you had loved mu∣sick so well, you should have had it before dinner.</P>
<P>A great Nobleman that was accounted mad by all that came near him, but yet had a great deal of craft withal; one day having got a great rusty horse nail in his hand, he made those in the house believe he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at it. With that all the physicians far and near were sent for; and after a long and serious consultation together, some said, it was good to send it out by way of purgation; others said, they would dissolve it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the body, and yet it should do him no hurt. He sitting by, and hearing all their discourse, told them, they were all fools and mount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anks: For, says he, could not you have applied a loadstone to my breech, and that would have drawn it out; for that attracts all iron to it.</P>
<P>A very covetous tradesman had a mind to be married, and yet was afraid for fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the charge of having children too fast; at last he resolved to marry, and agreed with his wife
<PB N="93" REF="028720_0091_0FDA627F6274A9D8"/>before marriage, that they would lie together but once a month: And says he, I intend to get every month a joint from head to foot of the child, so by that means we shall not have too many children; but I do it for this rea∣son, to ease thee in bringing of them up. Af∣ter marriage, it seems he lay with her the first night; and I know not how it came about, but at forty weeks end she was brought to bed of a brave boy, perfectly formed every way. Why, how now, wife, says he, this is not ac∣cording to my expectation? Yes, says she, but I may thank my good neighbours, or else, for ought I know, we might have had a deformed child.</P>
<P>At a market town in Yorkshire, there lived a Quaker, that was a barber, and the minister of the parish came to him for twenty shillings for tythes belonging to his parsonage: The Quaker told him he owed him none, nor none he would pay him. The parson told him, it was his due, and if he would not pay him by fair means, he'd get it by foul. The Quaker asked him, for what it was due? He told him for preaching and reading divine service, and other ministerial duties in the church. Why, says the Quaker, I never came there. You might if you would, said the parson, the door stands open. A little after, the Quaker hear∣ing that he was suing him for the money, en∣ters an action also against the parson for twenty shillings; when the Parson came to hear it, and went and asked him how he came to owe him twenty shillings? He told him, for trimming. Why, says the minister, I nev∣er

<P>A natural fool that served a knight in this kingdom, was commanded to give such a Lord his hand, which he presently did, but gave him his left hand; for which his master chid him, and told him he should have given the Lord his right hand.

<P>A Welchman riding with a charge of mon∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behind him, was set upon by a thief, who bade him deliver immediately; or (drawing a pistoly said, he would make it bounce through him. Say hur so, says the Welchman, since hur hath hur money, let hur hear one pounce for it, for hur never heard the pounce of a cun. The good natured thief to satisfy the curiosity of the Welchman, (whom he looked on as a very silly fellow) discharged his pis∣tol, which echoed in very many places. Cots splutter a nails, says the Welchman, it was a gallant pounce, and there was many little pounces too; Good her Urship, let her have one pounce more for hur money, and hur will be satisfied. So the thief discharged the oth∣er; at which the Welchman seemed better pleased than before, and asked if he had no more pounces: No, said the thief, I have no more: No! said the Welchman, then hur has one pounce in store, which hur will make pounce through hur immediately, if hur

<P>A young man married a cross piece of flesh, who not contented, though her husband was very kind, made continual complaints to her father, to the great grief of both families. The husband being no longer able to endure this scurvy humour, banged her soundly. Hereupon she complained to her father, who understanding well the perverseness of her humour, took her to task, and laced her sides soundly too; saying, go, and commend me to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usuand, and tell him, I am now even with him; for I have cudgelled his wife, as well as he hath beaten my daughter.</P>
<P>A gentleman who had a ruby face, came to a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber to be trimmed, and asked him, if he could or durst trim him? The barber replied, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he had learned his trade, and kept shop on purpose, and therefore both could, and durst, and would trim him, if he pleased. But, quoth the gallant, behold my face, and see the sugged difficulty of shaving it. If you trim me without bloodshed, I will give you ten shillings; but if I find you draw blood, with this stilletto I will stab you immediately. The brisk barber being more tempted with the rare reward of ten shillings, than dismayed by his threatening, undertakes it, and very artificial∣ly trims him without bloodshed, and the gen∣tleman was well pleased; but withal asked, How he durst venture upon him, since he was in so much hazard of his life? To whom the barber replied, I had no cause to fear my life; for if I had fetched blood of your face,
<PB N="96" REF="028720_0094_0FDA6285109D8E28"/>before you could have been sensible of it, I would quickly have let you blood in the wind∣pipe, and secured myself from your stab. The gentleman held up his hands in thanks for his deliverance, and vowed never to be trimmed upon those conditions again.</P>
<P>When Henry VIII dispatched Bishop Bon∣ner as an ambassador to Francis I, king of France, being at that time greatly incensed, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered many harsh words against the French king, and in these, and no other words, I charge thee, says he, deliver my embassy: But the bishop made answer, sir, if I should salute him in such gross and despiteful terms, and in his own court too, (forgetting the title of an ambassador) he can do no less than take off my head. Thy head! replied the king, if he should dare to offer it, twenty thousand of his subjects shall answer for that of thine. Aye, but, says the bishop, by your majesty's favour, I am doubtful whether any of those heads will fit my shoulders so well as that I have on. At which words, the king some∣what pacified, gave him leave to deliver his message in what language he thought best.</P>
<P>A man and his wife were striving for mas∣tery, who should wear the brecches, when (in the interim) one knocks at the door, which occasioned a cessation of blows for a time, whilst the good man steps to the door, and asked the party who he would speak to withal; who told him, with the master of the house. Stay, friend, says the man, but a little while, and I will resolve you, for as yet the case is doubtful. So stepping in, his wife and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>A templer going at Christmas into York∣shire, to see his father, took some other Tem∣plers along with him, and upon one of the holidays he carried them to an alehouse hard by, where the woman was deaf; coming thith∣er, O! my young master, says she, I have not seen you these seven years. Then he (think∣ing to abuse her) drank to her, saying, here's to thee, and to all the rogues, whores and bawds in England. She seeing his lips go, but hearing him not, said, come, sir, I'll pledge you, for I know you drink to your fa∣ther and mother, and those good gentlewomen your sisters.</P>
<P>A merry conceited Parson riding from London to Colchester, in a very rainy day, came about noon to an Inn in Chelmsford, and hav∣ing given the ostler his horse, went into the kitchen, where was a good fire so encompassed with unmannerly company, that the Parson could get no room: Whereupon he calls to the ostler, fetch me a peck of those Oysters which are to be sold at the gate, and give them my horse: Your horse, sir, replied the Ost∣ler; will your horse eat Oysters? I pray try, said the Parson. The country fellows hear∣ing what he said, left the fire to see the won∣der. In the interim, the Parson had his choice of feats, and fixed himself in a great
<PB N="98" REF="028720_0096_0FDA6287C610A0A8"/>chair next the sire. The Ostler having made trial, brought the Oysters back again, saying, sir, your horse will not touch them. Well, says the Parson, if he will not, bring them in hither, and I'll see if I can. The country fellows perceiving the plot, leered one upon another, laughed, and were ashamed to stay there any longer.</P>
<P>Two country attornies riding home from the term, overtook a carter, and began to jeer him, asking him, why his fore horse was so fat, and the rest so lean?

<P>A stout strong fellow that lived in the west country, who was the most famous in all those parts for many recreations, as pitching the bar, throwing the weight, football playing, riding, wrestling, fencing, so that none in his own country durst oppose him. But one day being in the company of some north country∣men, they were as highly commending a per∣son in the north, for all such like exercises, which did so trouble the west country champ∣ion, that he having inquired his name, quali∣ty and place of abode, the next morning sad∣led his horse, and rode a great journey from west to north to encounter him; but being come to his house near a Park, and asking for him, was told, that their master was not at home, but if he pleased to walk into the Park, about two bows shot, he should there find him alone. The western hero alights, and with his horse in his hand, came to the place, where
<PB N="99" REF="028720_0097_0FDA6288A5188560"/>he found him nailing of a pale, with a coun∣tenance very grim, and a tongue very silent; to whom the west countryman applies himself in this form, and told him, sir, I have heard much of your renown for active and strong exercises; they say you are the only man mag∣nified in the north, and I having as great fame in the west, have undertaken this long journey to you, that you and I may have a trial of skill, which of us two shall gain the conquest, and bear the name of victor. The north coun∣tryman, without saying any thing in answer, surveying his dimensions from head to foot, comes to the western Hector, put his hand un∣der his twist, pitched him over the Park pales, and falls to work again. The west country∣man rises up well satisfied, having no more but this to say, pray sir, throw my horse over too.</P>
<P>A person of quality in this kingdom, a∣mongst other gentlemen, did often meet at a Bowling Green, which stood next to the Church yard; and the Parson of that Church had this benefit, that if any did swear there, he was to have twelve pence for every oath: This person aforesaid happened to swear a Goliah oath, upon which the Parson demand∣ed twelve pence, which he gave him; and af∣ter that swore many others, for which he paid twelve pence apiece: and then swearing an∣other, he demanded twelve pence as before. Then he plucked out of his pocket a twenty shilling piece, and bade him give him nine∣teen shillings again; sir, says he, I cannot.

<P>A lusty young man was earnest with his fa∣ther to be married, and after much importu∣nity he was married to a neighbour's daugh∣ter; he had not been married six months, but he looked so bad, and was so ill and so feeble, that he could scarce stand upon his legs. A little after he espied a butcher running over a ploughed field after a mad bull; then he ask∣ed him why he did so? He told him to tame him. O! says he, let him be married, let him be married, if that do not tame him, I will be hanged.</P>
<P>A gentleman that had a great wit, and was well beloved among the great ones, and there∣fore invited often among them, but it seems had a very great leg; he being at a Noble∣man's table, greedily catched at a goblet of wine.

<P>A fellow who was a very great glutton, yet forsooth had a very great mind to be married; that is, to marry a very rich widow, and to that end, by his letters got admittance, and when he came, she saw the man was comely e∣nough, and well clad: But seeing him two or three times feed so largely, he asked a friend of here, what he was? He said, he was a great glutton: And when he came to speak with her about the matter, he protested he loved her as well as he did his own foul. By my troth,

<P>A devout gentleman being very earnest at his prayers in the church, it happened that a pickpocket being near him, stole away his watch, who having ended his prayers, missed it, and complained to his friend, that his watch was lost while he was at prayers.

<P>King James being in his progress at Wood∣stock, in Oxfordshire, the king finding it to rain so one morning that he could not ride a hunting, had got some of the nobility and gentry together, resolving to be merry: And one humour was, that the king having that morning a fine curveting horse given him, which kind of horse he never liked in his life, told them. That he that could tell the great∣est lie, should have that horse. So one told one lie, and another another; and several had told others, so that there was great laughing; and just in the midst of this mirth, in comes a country fellow, complaining to the king that some of his servants had wronged him: Well, well, says the king, we'll hear of that anon: Come, come hither amongst us, and you must know that he that can tell the greatest lie, shall have that horse. Truly Sir, says he, an't please your Grace, I never told a lie in all my life. With that, says the king, give him the horse, give him the horse, for I am sure that is the greatest lie that has been told today.</P>
<P>An honest man that was a true cavalier was, when he came from the wars, so reduced that

<P>Two gentleman travelling into the country, one of them had a hundred pounds in his portmanteau; alighting from his horse by a woodside to ease his body, a fellow comes out of the wood upon him, with a rabbit in his hand, desiring the gentleman to buy it of him; but he refused him, telling him, he knew not what to do with it, being troublesome to car∣ry: Whereupon the fellow whistles, and out comes a second, Says the first to him, Robin, the gentleman says, he won't buy the rabbit. How is that, says the second? But he must buy the rabbit; and then he whistles, and out comes two more; to whom the second says, Why, the gentleman refuses to buy the rabbit. How! refuse it, said they? But he must not refuse it; for he shall buy the rabbit. The gentleman looking one of them earnestly in the face, knew him to be a goldsmith that liv∣ed in London: upon which he replied, Well, Sirs, if I must buy the rabbit, pray what is the price of it? Says the goldsmith, only your money in the portmanteau. That's very dear, replied the gentleman, to give a hundred pounds for a rabbit. That's very true, said the goldsmith, were it an ordinary rabbit; but you never saw a fatter in your life, and that is the price, and you shall buy it. Well, says the
<PB N="103" REF="028720_0101_0FDA6291231B1750"/>gentleman, if I must it, there's your money; so they gave him the rabbit. The gentleman mounts his horse, and in a little riding, over∣takes his friend, to whom he says, since you left me, I have bought a rabbit, and we'll have it for supper; you shall pay me what the rab∣bit cost me, and for the roasting, and I'll find liquor to it. With all my heart, replies his friend. Coming to the Inn at night, it was accordingly done. Supper being ended, he asked him, what he gave for the rabbit? Why truly, says the gentleman, I had it cheap, it cost me but a hundred pounds. A hundred pounds! said his friend, sure you can't be in earnest! Upon that he tells him all the pre∣ceding story; and withal that he did not doubt but to receive his money again; for he was well assured he knew one of them. Coming up to London a little time after, he acquaints two or three friends more of this adventure, and they all agree to get a parcel of builion silver, and send for this goldsmith to a tavern near his house, and offer it for sale to him: They did so; the gentleman placing his friends in the next room, the goldsmith comes upon the summons. Sir, says the gentleman, I have some bullion silver, which I desire you to buy: What do you ask an ounce for it, says the goldsmith? Seven shillings and sixpence. Why, Sir, that's a price was never known, and I shall not throw away my money at that rate. So the gentleman knocks with his foot, and in comes one of his friends, to whom he says, Ralph, This man says he won't buy the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lver. How's that, says he? But he shall buy
<PB N="104" REF="028720_0102_0FDA629270EA00D0"/>the silver. And so knocking with his foot, in comes two more, and he tells them the same. How! Will you not buy the silver? Sir, you must, and shall buy the silver. The guilt of the goldsmith's former fact flying in his face, he returns the gentleman his hundred pounds, and gives him and his friends a treat of ten pounds more, to prevent them from publishing it to the world.</P>
<P>A man was saying, that such a man had an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll opinion of him.

<P>A Cobler was fitting in his shop singing merrily; his song was this, "Tamerlane was, and he was;" and continued so singing, and nothing else, many times together; which a gentleman that passed by, took notice of, and said to the Cobler, Prithee, friend, what was he? Why, says the Cobler, as great a fool as yourself, for aught I know. Sirrah, says the gentleman, you are a rascal; come out, and I'll kick you. No, sir, says he, 'tis no mat∣ter, I thank you for your love as much as if I had it, for I don't want kicking. Sirrah, says the gentleman again, come out, and I'll give you a kick. No, sir, says he, you need not trouble yourself, I won't come if you'd give me two.</P>
<P>A parson of a parish was thought to be more familiar than ordinary with a woman that had ten children, and she told her husband that nine w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re his, and no more. Well, says he,

<P>A scholar coming home from Cambridge to his father, his father asked him what he had learned? Why, father, says he, I'll prove these two chickens to be three? How is that, say the father?

<P>A poor countryman had so spent his time in true and honest pains, contented and not murmuring, that fortune seemed to smile upon him, as oft as he came to worship at her tem∣ple, whither he often resorted; the gracious looks of the goddess encouraged him to ask something more than before he used; and yet considering with himself, that too bold a vota∣ry might be repulsed, he modestly bounded his request with his suit, that her goodness would confer three wishes upon him, which from the oracle was answered, Ratified, wish and be happy. The joyful man acquainted his wife straight, who had been the constant
<PB N="106" REF="028720_0104_0FDA629863700580"/>companion of his labours, was to have share in his good fortune, and desired of her husband that one of those wishes might be left to her disposal. The good old man willing to grati∣fy her, granted her request: So to the Fair they came, whither they were bound, and the woman casting her eyes round about, to see what she should make the choice of her wish, at last (remembering what she wanted at home) espied a handsome wooden ladle, which she forthwith wished for, and as soon the thing was in her hand; which her husband seeing, and impatient at the miscarriage of the first wish, wroth with his wife for her simplicity, wished the ladle in her breech, which out of hand was instantly there. But the poor wom∣an (like a fly with a straw in the same place) was so tormented, besides the shame, that she desired her husband, that as he ever hoped to partake of her love, he would remove this impediment: To which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good man condescended, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n charity to his wife, wished it out again: So all the three wishes went in and out with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adle.</P>
<P>A felon going to execution on a cold win∣ter's day, and coming near a great pond on this side Tyburn, desired the carman to stop, that he might speak with the sheriff; who be∣ing come to him, he said thus: Mr. sheriff, I am now going to leave the world, and there∣fore I would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth to conceal any thing which may do others good: I confess that the last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obbery I committed was in this place; and I being closely pursued, having a great purse of money, I threw it into the midst o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="107" REF="028720_0105_0FDA629924C29D30"/>this pond. The people bearing him tell this to the sheriff, notwithstanding the coldness of the weather, presently ran into the pond to searen for the money; which they did a long time, till they were weary, as was the sheriff with staying; whereupon he came to the felon again, and inquired further if he was not mistaken. No, quoth the felon, I in∣tended to have some mirth and sport before I was hanged, and now I have had my desire in seeing the people wet and cool themselves for nothing; and therefore now you may drive on when you please.</P>
<P>A certain young gentleman, well known a∣mong the choice spirits of Charleston, South∣carolina, for singing a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, being lately recovered from an indisposition, which made him look rather down in the mouth, was ac∣costed by an old acquaintance, with, "how are you, my buck?

<P>A few years since, some boys, equipped in mock military accoutrements, such as paper caps, paper belts, wooden swords, &amp;c. were beating up for recruits in Parliament street, Boston; their serjeant made a stand at a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ner, and a number of people soon collected a∣bout him, among whom were some officers of the British army, of the delicate cast, then quartered in Boston: Young Kite delivered his speech at the drum head; after which

How durst you insult his majesty's service? You a soldier! why you are a dis∣grace to human nature; march off directly, or I shall chastise your presumption." On this the poor rejected lad was retiring apace, when an arch boy, eying the spectators in scarlet with a look shrewdly expressive, at the same time pulling the serjeant by the sleeve, "Sir," says he, "call him back, call him back, he'll do for an officer."</P>
<P>During the late war, an English frigate hav∣ing come up the Patomack, a party was land∣ed, who set fire to and destroyed some gentle∣men's houses on the Maryland side in sight of Mount Vernon, Gen.

<PB N="109" REF="028720_0107_0FDA629C5BEAC250"/>in consequence of which, he had given him orders by no means to comply with any such demands, for that he would make no un∣worthy compromise with the enemy, and was ready to meet the sate of his neighbours." The captain was highly incensed on receiving this answer, and removed his frigate to the Virginia shore; but before he commenced his operations, he sent another message to the same purpose offering likewise a passport t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. Washington to come on board: He went accordingly in the boat, carrying with him a small present of poultry, of which he begged the captain's acceptance. His presence pro∣duced the best effect—he was hospitably re∣ceived, notwithstanding he repeated the same sentiments with the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmness. The cap∣tain expressed his personal respect for the character of the General, commending the character of Mr. Lund Washington, and as∣sured him, nothing but his having misconceiv∣ed the terms of the first answer, could have induced him for a moment to conceive the i∣dea of taking the smallest measure offensive to so illustrious a character as the General, ex∣plaining at the same time the real or supposed prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cations which had compelled his severi∣ty on the other side of the river. Mr. Wash∣ington, after spending some time in perfect harmony on board, returned, and instantly dispatched sheep, hogs, and an abundant sup∣ply of other articles, as a present to the Eng∣lish Frigate.</P>
<P>The constitution of Pennsylvania makes a year's residence in the state, and payment of
<PB N="110" REF="028720_0108_0FDA629DA60615C8"/>taxes, the sole requisite to qualify a man for an elector.</P>
<P>At an election, when parties were violent, each warmly canvassing for suffrages, a cap∣tain of a ship, then lying at the wharf, took his seamen to a magistrate, paid a tax for each, and procured a certificate of the pay∣ment—then putting such tickets or votes in their hands, as he pleased, led them to the statehouse, where they all longed their votes.</P>
<P>On the return of the ship the next voyage, just before she arrived in Delaware bay, she was surrounded by a vast multitude of por∣poises, pursuing a westerly course with the ship. "See here," says one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilors to his ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, "what a merry company we have." "Yes, d—n 'em," replies Jack, "they are driving for Philadelphia, I believe, to pay taxes, and vote for assemblymen." The captain, who was then walking on the quar∣ter deck, heard the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>castick wag, and smiled, but said not a word.</P>
<P>Soon after the settlement of Virginia, cap∣tain Smith, then president of the council, con∣ducted a party of men a few miles from James∣town, to cut timber.—Among the rest were two gentlemen, who had not been used to la∣bour. As they were at work, their fingers began to be blistered, and the pain of holding their axes was such as to extort an oath at ev∣ery third blow. To prevent this, the presi∣dent ordered the oaths each day to be num∣bered, and at night condemned each man to have a can of water for each oath poured into his sleeve. These washings had the desired
<PB N="111" REF="028720_0109_0FDA62A2E663E180"/>effect, and it was afterwards rare to hear an eath in a week.</P>
<P>When the American war was warmly agi∣tated by the British ministry, Mrs. Wright, who was modelling the head of lord North, anxious to hear something respecting her na∣tive country, waited on him, to see how far she had improved in the likeness; and soon turned the conversation to the affairs of Amer∣ica. She assured him of the little probability of success, and with her usual warmth declar∣ed, that if he did not immediately recall the troops, and make atonement for the blood that had already been shed, he should lose his head. He laughed, and told her, it was of little consequence, respecting himself, as long as he preserved her friendship, which at all e∣vents he should be careful to do: For you know, Mrs. Wright, continued he, if they should cut my head off, 'tis in your power to make me another.</P>
<P>In the year 1785, a farmer of Bucks' coun∣ty, assisted by his people, working in harvest, killed a rattlesnake; and soon after having occasion to go home, took up by mistake his son's jacket, and put it on; the son was a stripling, and both their jackets were made of the same kind of cloth. The old man being warm, did not button the jacket until he got to the house, then found it much too little for him: he instantly conceived the idea, that he had been imperceptibly bitten by the rattle∣snake, and swelled from the effects of the poi∣son; he grew suddenly very ill, and was put to bed. The people about him were very
<PB N="112" REF="028720_0110_0FDA62A478790030"/>much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larmed, and sent for two or three phy∣sicians; one of whom poured down his throat a pint of melted lard—another gave him a do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of wild plantain—and the third made him drink hoar hound tea, made very strong. Not∣withstanding all, he grew worse and was to appearance on the verge of dissolution, when his son came home, with the old gentleman's jacket hanging like a bag about him. The whole mystery was at once unravelled, and the poor farmer, notwithstanding his drenches of hogs' fat, plantain and hoarhound, was well in an instant.</P>
<P>At the siege of Charleston, an American soldier had been bribed to convey to the ene∣my a plan and state of the works, ammuni∣tion, &amp;c. After he had passed the lines, he was discovered by the piquette; who, having repeatedly called on him to return, were at length obliged to fire at him, and wounded him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that he could not proceed. Upon ex∣amining the papers with which he was charg∣ed, they were found so accurately and ingeni∣ously executed, that General Lincoln was con∣vinced they were the work of another hand, and offered the soldier his life, provided he would discover the person in the garrison, who had employed him. This offer was re∣jected, with an observation, that he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the risque which accompanied his attempt, and had received an adequate consideration. The usual arrangements were therefore made for his execution, and the rope being tied about his neck, the General hoped that such circum∣stances might have shaken his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtitude, and
<PB N="113" REF="028720_0111_0FDA62A8B0514EF8"/>sent an aiddecamp to make another tender of pardon upon the same terms "No!" ex∣claimed the resolute victim, "You have my life in your power, but my honour is my own." The signal was immediately given, he was consigned to eternity, under the impression of this noble sentiment: And it is remarka∣ble, that the hangman, as he descended from his duty, was killed by a shot from the British piquette. Such conduct, however, proves the inconsistency of the human character; nor is it easy to conceive, how a mind, so solicitous to preserve its dignity in a matter merely per∣sonal, should have condescended to engage in a treachery, destructive to publick confidence and allegiance.</P>
<P>During the late war, an old citizen of Charlestown happened to fall into the hands of a party of British troops, in one of their excursions to Dorchester. On the party's re∣turning towards town, they stopped to refresh themselves at a plantation on Goose creek; and the soldiers began to jeer their prisoner for rebelling against the king. He not wish∣ing to offend them (as his life had been threatened, and they were then preparing a halter for a prisoner) answered, that he had enjoyed many happy days under the reign of George the second, and some agreeable mo∣ments since the present gentleman came to the crown. The commanding officer, a Caledoni∣an, who was supposed to be asleep, imagining the prisoner intended to degrade she royalty of his king, jumped up in a violent rage, and asked how he had the audacions assurance of
<PB N="114" REF="028720_0112_0FDA62A9A5B32F20"/>presuming to call the king a gentleman, and told him that if such another word escaped his lips, he would instantly cut him to atoms. The prisoner being terrified at the menaces of this highland butcher, replied, that he had no in∣tention of casting any reflection on his maj∣esty, as he had always <HI>suppased</HI> him to be a gentleman.</P>
<P>The Peruvians had a custom, on the death of any distinguished person, to inter along with him to keep him company, the servant that had been attached to him in his life. A young man who had lost his master, and who had also lost an eye, was selected to have the honour of accompanying him to the other world: But not being ambitious of the prefer∣ence, he exclaimed—"Do you know what you are doing? Are you not wanting in re∣spect to my master, thus to choose a person who has but one eye to serve him in the other world?" The Peruvians consulted, and the young man saved his life.</P>
<P>The following example of laudable pride in a soldier, was mentioned in a letter from an officer of the American army, written soon after the battle of Monmouth.—A soldier in that memorable action, fell into the hands of the English cavalry, when one of them knock∣ed him down, and attempted to picrce him through the back with his sword.—"Strike me in the heart," said he, turning br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>skly a∣bout, "that my friends may not blush for me after my death."</P>
<P>The day on which the federal convention agreed to the new constitution, presented to
<PB N="115" REF="028720_0113_0FDA62ABF2011A08"/>she publick, the great Dr. Franklin asked a gentleman who sat next to him, whether he had taken notice of the picture of the sun in the recess at the back of the president's chair? He replied that he had, but not with a par∣ticular attention. The Doctor then observed that painters had been puzzled to paint a sin∣gle sun in such manner that the spectator could determine whether it was a rising or a setting sun; he added, that he had viewed the picture before mentioned as often as he had been in the hall, and never had been able to come to a determination, but now he was sure it was a rising sun.</P>
<P>When governor Johnston was president in West Florida, at a publick meeting of the Indians and commissioners for determining the provincial boundaries, he plied the sa∣chems so briskly with liquor, that they were, according to the old saying, as great as kings. Meeting the next morning with one of the Indian chiefs, he asked him what he thought of the liquor he had drank. "It seems to me," says the copper coloured warrior, "to be a juice extracted from the tongues of wom∣en and the hearts of lions; for, after drink∣ing freely of it, I was as loquacious as a wom∣an, and felt as bold as a lion."</P>
<P>About fifty years ago, the general assembly of New hampshire used to fit in a tavern. A countryman happened to come into Ports∣mouth to buy nails, and was enquiring at the shops for single tens. A waggish fellow, known by the name of doctor Moses, over∣hearing him, directed him to the tavern,
<PB N="116" REF="028720_0114_0FDA62ADA499ACB8"/>where he told him were plenty of single tens. The man went, and inquired of two members who happened to be in the porch—they deem∣ed it an insult on the honour of the house, and made a complaint to the speaker. The man was taken into custody and laid the blame on Moses. He was then sent for, and having acknowledged the fact, was ordered to receive the speaker's reprimand and ask pardon on his knees. Moses obeyed, and having performed his humiliation, as he was rising from the floor, brushed his knees with his hand, and exclaimed, a dirty house! a dirty house!</P>
<P>An Indian chief of the Creek nation, being once appointed to negociate a treaty of peace with the people of Southcarolina, was desired by the governor and council to speak his mind freely, and not to be afraid, for he was among friends. "I will speak freely, I will not be afraid," said he, "for why should I be afraid among my friends, who never am among my enemies?"</P>
<P>The Elizabeth, an English man of war, would infallibly have been lost in the shoals on the coast of Florida, in 1746, had not cap∣tain Edwards ventured into the Havannah. It was in time of war, and the port belonged to an enemy. "I come," said the captain to the governor, "to deliver up my ship, my sailors, my soldiers and myself, into your hands: I only ask the lives of my men." "No," said the Spanish commander, "I will not be guilty of so dishonourable an action. Had we taken you in fight, in open sea, or up∣on our coasts, your ship would have been

But, as you are driven in by stress of weather, and are come hither for fear of be∣ing cast away, I ought, and do forget that my nation is at war with yours. You are men, and so are we; you are in distress, and have a right to our pity. You are at lib∣erty to unload and refit your vessel; and, if you want it, you may trade in this port to pay your charges: You may then go away, and you will have a pass to carry you safe beyond the Bermudas.

<P>Sir Simon Stuart, of Hartley, England, a∣musing himself with some old papers belong∣ing to his family, found endorsed on the out∣side of a covenant, that 15,000 pieces of gold were buried in a certain field, so many feet from the ditch, towards the south. These words appearing a kind of memorandum, the baronet took a servant with him, and going to the place described, made him dig, and found the treasure in a large iron pot, the mouth of which was covered with parchment, on which were written in legible characters, the follow∣ing words: The devil shall have it sooner than Cromwell.</P>
<P>An agreeable woman, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom Santeuil ow∣ed some money, meeting him one day at a pri∣vate house, asked him the reason she had not seen him so long; "Is it because you owe me something?" "No, madam, (replied the po∣et) that is not what prevents my visiting, and you are the cause that you are not paid."

<P>At the siege of Lisle, in queen Anne's time, upon an attack on some of the outworks, the grenadiers of the 15th regiment of foot, were obliged to retire, by the springing of a mine, or by the superiority of the enemy's fire. In this retreat, the lieutenant of those grenadiers, remarkable for his ill treatment of them, was wounded, and fell. The grenadiers were passing on, nor heeded his entreaties to help him off. At last he laid hold of a pair of shoes that was tied to the waistbelt of one of them: The grenadier, regardless of his situa∣tion, and in resentment of his former ill usage, took out a knife from his pocket, with which he cut the string, and left them with him, with this remarkable expression. "There! There is a new pair of shoes for you, to carry you to hell."</P>

<P>While a sailor's sentence was pronouncing, who committed a robbery on the highway, he raised a piece of rolled tobacco to his mouth, and held it between his teeth. When the sentence was finished, he bit off a piece of the tobacco, and began to chew it with great unconcern.—"Sirrah! (said the judge, piqued at his indifference) do you know that you are to be hanged in a very short time?" "So I hear," said the sailor, squirting a little tobacco
<PB N="119" REF="028720_0117_0FDA62B4E6CDB358"/>juice from his mouth at the same time.—"Do you know (rejoined the judge) where you shall go when you die?"—"I cannot tell, indeed, an't please your honour," said the sailor.— "Why then (replied the judge, with a tre∣mendous voice, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell you, you will go to hell."—"If I should, replied the sailor, with perfect tranquillity I hope, please your hon∣our, I shall be able to hear it."</P>
<P>When lord Sandwich received he first in∣telligence from Lloyd's coffeehouse of St. Vin∣cent's being taken, he hurried to the king to in∣form him of it, and when admitted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n audi∣ence, with great earnestness recommended that it would be wise to smother the matter.— "Smother it!" said the king, with surprise, "By H—n! the child is too big; we can't smother it, my lord."</P>
<P>Foote, whose talent lay in lampooning and mimickry, even in his early days, had once got the knack of imitating a late general offi∣cer, in the shrug of his soldiers, the lisping of his speech, and some other things, for which the general was remarkable, so that it grew a common topick among his acquaintance, who used to say, "Come Sam, let's have the gene∣ral's company." A friend at length acquaint∣ed the officer with it, who sent for Foote. "Sir," says the general, "I hear you have an excellent talent at mimicking characters, and among the rest, I find I have been the subject of your ridicule." "Oh, sir," says Foote, with great pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntry, "I take all my acquaintance off at times, and, what is more particular, I often take myself off." "God so," says the other, "pray let us have a speci∣men."
<PB N="120" REF="028720_0118_0FDA62B66790B150"/>Foote, on this, puts on his hat and gloves, takes hold of his cane, and making a short bow, left the room. The officer waited some minutes for his return, but at length, on inquiry, found he had really taken himself off, by leaving the house. The officer was gene∣ral Blakeney, with whom he was afterwards in the strictest friendship.</P>
<P>Foote and Garrick being at a tavern togeth∣er at the time of the first regulation of the gold coin, the former pulling out his purse to pay the reckoning, asked the latter, "What he should do with a light guinea he had?" "'Pshaw, 'tis worth nothing," says Garrick, "Fling it to the devil." "Well, David," says the other, "You are what I always took you for, ever contriving to make a guinea go farther than any other man."</P>
<P>When Lewis XIV. came to the throne, he was remarkably obstinate, and it could not be known whether he took advice of any one. He had no publick council, nor any private counsellor. One day being hunting on a very small Britanny bider, cardinal Mazarin fre∣quently repeated, "What a very strong horse that must be!" "Why so, my good cardinal?" said the king, "Why, sire," answered his em∣inence, "It not only carries your majesty, but the whole body of your council." From that moment the king took the hint, and, of course, advice, and became one of the greatest mon∣archs in the world.</P>
<P>When Dr. Johnson was first patronized by lord Chesterfield, the Doctor called on him one morning, and being shewn into an antecham∣ber,
<PB N="121" REF="028720_0119_0FDA62B7E4F0DD08"/>either from the mistake of the sootman, or his lordship's paying a preference to other company, the Doctor was left waiting there for two hours, without his lordship's appear∣ance. Johnson growing piqued at this neg∣lect, abruptly left the house, and from that hour resolved to break off all acquaintance with him. Some time after this, lord Chester∣field endeavoured all he could to recover Johnson's friendship, by writing two essays in favour of his dictionary, in a periodical paper then publishing, called "The World," as well as by other indirect solicitations; but all in vain: Johnson was not only resolved, but wrote his lordship word so, in a very remarka∣ble letter, wherein, with great dignity and phi∣losophick pride, he begged leave to be dismissed his patronage and acquaintance. Some time after this, a friend met the Doctor in Dods∣ley's shop, and asked him how he could desert a man who had been so serviceable to him, in the publick encouragement of his dictionary, as lord Chesterfield was? "Serviceable to me, sir!" says the author, "In no respect whatso∣ever: I had been for years failing round the world of literature, and just as I was getting into the chops of the channel, his lordship sends out two little cocko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats, more to partake of my triumphs, than to pilot me into harbour.

<P>As the celebrated Dr. Johnson was sitting in a coffeeroom, where a dog was very trouble∣some, he ordered the waiter to kick him out; the waiter not being so alert as he should be, the Doctor repeated his orders; upon which a young genius faid to the Doctor, I perce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

<P>Waller, the celebrated poet, in Oliver Crom∣well's protectorate, wrote many extravagant poems in his praise. When Charles II. came to the throne, he likewise wrote a poem upon the restoration, inscribed to that monarch, with which he was introduced to his majesty. The king, after having read the poem, told Waller, the lines were good, but not so good as some addressed to Oliver. To which the poet, with admirable presence of mind, repli∣ed, that poets always succeed best in fiction.</P>
<P>The celebrated Quin happened to be in a returned post chaise between Bath and Bristol, when the post boy, in order to increase his perquisite, took up another passenger, who
<PB N="123" REF="028720_0121_0FDA62C024FEB018"/>proved a very disagreeable one, having very sweaty feet, as well as being guilty of many indecencies. Quin was determined to get rid of him; a lucky opportunity offered, for the passenger asked him how long he meant to stay at Bristol; that, said Quin, depends upon the effect the sea water has upon me. What, said the other, are you going to drink it? No, said he, I am going to be dipped for the bite of a mad dog, and immediately shewed some distor∣tion of features, which the passenger took for indications of madness, and precipitately left the chaise.</P>

<P>King Charles II. on a certain time paying a visit to Dr. Busby, the Doctor is said to have strutted through his school with his hat upon his head, while his majesty walked complais∣antly behind him, with his hat under his arm; but when he was taking his leave at the door, the Doctor with great humility, thus addressed him: Sire, I hope your majesty will excuse my want of respect hitherto; but if my boys were to imagine there was a greater man in the kingdom than myself, I should never be able to rule them.</P>

<P>Quin, having had an invitation from a no∣bleman, who was reputed to keep a very ele∣gant table, to dine with him; and having no manner of aversion to a good repast, he ac∣cordingly waited on his lordship, but found the regale far from answering his expectation. Upon his taking leave, the servants, who were very numerous, had ranged themselves in the hall. Quin finding that if he gave to each of them, it would amount to a pretty large sum, asked, Which was the cook? who readily an∣swered, Me, sir. He then inquired for the but∣ler, who was as quick in replying as the oth∣er; when he said to the first—Here is half a crown for my eating—and to the other—Here is five shillings for my wine; but by G—, gentlemen, I never made so bad a dinner for the money in my life.</P>

<P>The late general Elbert of Georgia, having burst a blood vessel, thought it necessary to employ another physician, to consult with the gentleman who usually attended him.

<P>The late lord Courtney, who was of one of the oldest families in Britain, being married to a miss Clack, who was much inferior in point of birth, a conversation took place (at which the late bishop of Exeter was present) on the disparity of the match. "What is your ob∣jection?" says the bishop to a lady who took the principal lead in the conversation. "Want of family, my lord"—"Want of family," ech∣oed the bishop, "why I'll prove her of a better family than his lordship. He perhaps may trace his ancestors as far back as the con∣quest, but the family of the Clacks are as old as Eve."</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson being engaged by Mr. Osborne, a bookseller, to translate a work of some con∣sequence, he thought it a respect which he owed his own talents, as well as the credit of his employer, to be as circumspect in the per∣formance of it as possible. In consequence of which, the work went on (agreeably to Of∣borne's ideas, who measured most things by the facility with which they were done) rath∣er slowly: Accordingly he frequently spoke to Dr. Johnson of this circumstance; and be∣ing a man of a coarse mind, sometimes by his expressions, made him feel the situation of dependence. Dr. Johnson, however, seemed to take no notice of him, but went on accord∣ing
<PB N="128" REF="028720_0126_0FDA62CDB074FBC8"/>to that plan he had prescribed to himself. Osborne, wishing to have the book out to an∣swer some temporary purpose, and perhaps ir∣ritated by what he thought an ignorant delay, one day went into the room where Dr. John∣son was, and abused him in the most illiberal manner: Amongst other things he told him "he had been much mistaken in his man; that he was recommended to him as a good scholar, and a ready hand; but he doubted both: For that Tom such a one of the Old Baily (if he could rely on his sobriety) would have turned out the work much sooner, and that being the case, the probability was, that by this here time, the edition would have mov∣ed off."</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson heard him for some time un∣moved; but at last, losing all patience, he seized up a huge folio, which he was at that time consulting, and aiming a blow at the bookseller's head, succeeded so forcibly, as to send him sprawling to the floor: Osborne a∣larmed the family with his cries; but, Dr. Johnson, clapping his foot on his breast, would not let him stir, till he had exposed him in that situation; and then left him with this triumphant expression:</P>
<P>"Lie there, thou son of duilness, ignorance, and obscurity!"</P>
<P>James Boswell, requested of his father, the lord president, his opinion, of the immortal Dr. Johnson, and whether he did not think him a "perfect constellation in the literary hemisphere"—"Yes, my son, said he emphat∣ically, "he is—the ursa major, the great bear.</P>

Louis XIV, was told, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d Stair was one of the best bred men in Europe. "I shall soon put him to the test," said the king; and asking lord Stair to take an airing with him, as soon as the door of the coach was opened, he bade him pass and go in: The other bowed and obeyed. The king said, "the world is in the right in the character it gives: Anoth∣er person would have troubled me with cere∣mony."</P>
<P>The following is an account of the courage∣ous behaviour of one Gillit a French quarter∣master, who going home to his friends, had the good fortune to save the life of a young wom∣an, attacked by two ruffians. He fell upon them, sabre in hand, unlocked the jaw of the first villain, who held a dagger to her breast, and at one stroke pared the nails of the other, (who was armed with a pistol) just above the wrist. Money was offered by the grateful pa∣rents; he refused it; they offered him their daughter, a young girl of 16, in marriage; the veteran, then in his 73d year, declining, say∣ing, "Do you think that I have rescued her from instant death, to put her to a lingering one, by coupling so lively a body with one worn out with age?"</P>
<P>A French officer at a general review before the king, dans la plaine des Sablons in Paris, while he was running on horseback through the ranks, happened to let his hat fall on the ground; a soldier picking it up with a drawn sword, made a hole into it, which put the of∣ficer in such a violent passion, that he declar∣ed he would sooner have the sword through
<PB N="130" REF="028720_0128_0FDA62D15C698770"/>his guts than his hat. His majesty hearing this strange declaration, asked him the reason: "Why?" said he, "there is a surgeon of my acquaintance, who, I am sure, would give me credit; but I know of no hatter that will."</P>
<P>The abbe Gaglioni sent to Benedict XIV, at the desire of that pontiff, a box filled with the natural curiosities of Mount Vesuvius. The box was accompanied with a letter which contained nothing more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these words of the evangelist. "Command that these stones shall become bread." The pope explained his meaning by sending him a brief for a pension, to which he subjoined these words in his own hand writing.—"You have faith, I perceive, in the infallibility of the sovereign pontiff, of which I now send you a fresh proof. It be∣longs to me to expound the holy writ, in do∣ing which I ought always to attend to the spirit of the scripture, and I never explained it with more pleasure than on this occasion."</P>
<P>Mr. Helvetius had a secretary named Bau∣dot, who had known him from his infancy: And presumed from this circumstance to treat him with as much rude familiarity as a four pre∣ceptor would treat his pupil. One of the chief pleasures of this captious and ill temper∣ed man, was to censure the conduct, the ge∣nius, the character and the works of this mild and indulgent philosopher. His strictures were always concluded with severe and per∣sonal satire. Having once attended with great patience to the railings of Baudot, he went to his lady, one of the most virtuous and amiable
<PB N="131" REF="028720_0129_0FD9BC2D28E423C0"/>women in the world, and said, "Madam Helvetius, can it be possible that I have all the faults Baudot finds in me:"—"Surely not," said madam Helvetius, "Nevertheless, I have some," replied he, "and who will tell me of THEM, if I should turn away Baudot."</P>
<P>Soon after lord Chesterfield came into the privy council, a place of great trust happened to become vacant, to which the king and the duke of Dorset recommended two very differ∣ent persons. His majesty espoused the inter∣est of his friend with some heat, and told them, He would be obeyed; but not being able to succeed, he left the council chamber in great displeasure. As soon as he retired, the matter was debated warmly, but at length, it was car∣ried against the king, because if they once gave him his way, he would expect it again, and so it would rise at length to a precedent. How∣ever, in the humour his majesty was then in, a question arose, who would carry the grant of the office for his majesty to sign? and the lot fell upon lord Chesterfield. His lordship expected to find his majesty in a very unfav∣ourable mood; and accordingly it happened so; wherefore he prudently forebore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in∣cense him by an abrupt request; and instead of bluntly asking him to sign the instrument, very submissively asked whose name his majes∣ty would be pleased to have inserted, to fill up the blanks?—The king answered in a pas∣sion, The devil's, if you will. Very well, re∣plied his lordship; But would your majesty have the instrument run in the usual stile, Our trusty and well beloved cousin and counsellor?
<PB N="132" REF="028720_0130_0FDA62D49C77A0D0"/>The king laughed, and with all the good na∣ture in the world set his name to the paper, though to promote a person not very accepta∣ble to himself.</P>
<P>A gentleman met another in the street, who was ill of a consumption, and accosted him thus—"Ah! my friend, you walk exceeding∣ly slow"—"Yes (replied the sick man) but I am going very fast."</P>
<P>When doctor Samuel Johnson made the tour of Scotland, in 1773, he was admitted, speci∣ali gratia, into the fraternity of sages, known at Edinburgh by the title of the Physico Theo∣logical Society. The conversation, as usual, turned upon a very abstruse point of meta∣physicks, viz. Whether a man would accept of existence by choice, or whether the Deity, to carry on the present system of things, must not compel him to existence by necessity? After many hours speech in the most subtle and acute refinements of logick, the whole company turned their eyes on the doctor, and requested to hear his sentiments. His an∣swer was couched in his usual cynical strain. "For my part, I think the solution of the question ultimately depends on the single cir∣cumstance, of considering under what denomi∣nation of country the supposed subject for ex∣istence was to be discriminated. If he was to be an Englishman, he would exist by choice; if a Scotchman, by necessity."</P>
<P>Doctor Johnson, and Mr. Boswell, dining one day at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ady Macleod's, the former was helped to some green p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as, which were es∣seemed a varity for the season: having eaten
<PB N="133" REF="028720_0131_0FDA62D830DCAEA8"/>what was first laid on his plate, lady Macleod offered to help him a second time. "Pshaw, madam, (says the doctor) surely they are only food for hogs."—"It is for that very reason, sir, that I help you," replied her ladyship.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson coming up Fleet street, at about two o'clock in the morning, was alarmed by a person seemingly in great distress. He fol∣lowed the voice for some time, when, by the glimmer of an expiring lamp, he perceived an unhappy female, almost naked, and perishing on a truss of straw, who had just enough to tell him, "she was turned out by an inhuman landlord in that condition, and to beg his char∣itable assistance not to let her die in the street." The doctor, melted at this story, desired her to place her confidence in God, for that under him he would be her protector. He accord∣ingly looked out for a coach to put her into; but there was none to be had: His charity, however, was too strong to be cooled by such an accident. He kneeled down by her side, raised her in his arms, wrapped his great coat about her, placed her on his back, and in this condition carried her home to his house.</P>
<P>Next day her disorder appearing to be vene∣real, he was advised to abandon her; but he replied, "that may be as much her misfor∣tune as her fault; I am determined to give her the chance of a reformation;" he accord∣ingly kept her in his house above thirteen weeks, where she was regularly attended by a physician, who recovered her.</P>
<P>The doctor, during this time learned more of her story, and finding her to be one of those
<PB N="134" REF="028720_0132_0FDA62DB16BA2938"/>unhappy women, who are impelled to this miserable life more from necessity than in∣clination, he set on foot a subscription, and established her in a milliner's shop in the country, where she was living some years ago in very considerable repute.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Wager, was seized with a fe∣ver while he was out upon a cruize; and the surgeon without much difficulty prevailed up∣on him to lose a little blood, and suffer a blister to be laid on his back; by and by it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought necessary to lay on another blister and repeat the bleeding, to which Sir Charles also consented; the symptoms then abated, and the surgeon told him, that he must now swallow a few bolusses and take a draught; No doctor, says Sir Charles, you shall batter my hulk as long as you will, but d—n me! you shan't board me.</P>
<P>The reverend Basil Kennet was once chap∣lain in a ship of war, and as his place was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess with his brother officers, he found they were so addicted to the impious and not sensi∣cal vice of swearing, that he thought it not becoming his character to continue any longer among them, unless he could prevail upon them to leave it off; but conceiving at the same time that any grave remonstrance would have but little effect, he bethought himself of a stratagem which might answer his purpose, One of the company having entertained the rest with a story agreeable enough in itself, but so interrupted and perplexed with damme! blood and wounds! and such like shocking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as made it extremely ridiculous;—
<PB N="135" REF="028720_0133_0FDA62DC583EF090"/>Mr. Kennet then began a story himself, which he made very entertainining and instructive, but interlarded it with the words, bottle, pot and glass, at every sentence. The gentleman who was the most given to the silly vice, fell a laughing at Mr. Kennet with an air of great contempt. Why, said he, G—d d—me doctor, as to your story it is well enough; but what the d—I have we to do with your d—d bottle, pot and glass? Mr. Kennet very calmly re∣plied, sir, I find you can observe what is ri∣diculous in me, which you cannot discover in yourself; and therefore you ought not to be offended at my expletives in discourse, any more than your own.—Oh! oh! d—me parson, I smoke you; you shall not hear me swear another oath, whilst I am in your com∣pany—nor did he.</P>
<P>During the protectorship of Oliver Crom∣well, a design was formed for reestablishing the Jews, with full liberty to carry on trade, and exercise their religion; but though this affair met with violent opposition from the heads of the different sectaries, yet Oliver so far carried his point, as to encourage a small body of them to settle in their old quarter, under the direction of Manasseh Ben Israel, a great rabbi, who soon built a synagogue and publickly performed divine worship. The intelligence which the protector received, from time to time, by means of the extensive correspondence and close amity everywhere maintained throughout the universe among the scattered remains of the Jewish nation, con∣tributed not a little to the success of his en∣terprises
<PB N="136" REF="028720_0134_0FDA62DFA71A50A0"/>abroad, and particularly to that of his naval expeditions; an instance of which is somewhere upon record, and thus related: As the earl of Orrery was once walking with Cromwell in one of the galleries at Whitehall, a man almost in rags appeared in view; upon which Cromwell immediately left the earl, and took that person with him into his closet, who told him of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great sum of money that the Spaniards were sending over in a Dutch man of war, to pay their army in Flanders; and also the very part of the ship where the money was deposited. The protector then im∣mediately sent an express to Smith (afterward Sir Jeremy Smith) who lay in the Downs, informing him that, within a day or two, such a Dutch ship would pass the chan∣nel, which he must search for the Span∣ish money. Accordingly, when the ship passed by Dover, Smith sent, and demanded leave to search her. The Dutch captain replied, That none but his masters should search him. Upon which Smith sent him word again, that he had set up an hour glass, and if he did not submit to the search before it was run out, he would sink him. The Dutchman seeing it was in vain to contend with superior force, submitted in time; and so all the money was found. The next time Cromwell saw lord Orrery, he told him, he had his intelligence from that seemingly for∣lorn Jew, he saw him go to some days before.</P>
<P>When the Essay on Man was first publish∣ed, it came out in part and without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name. A little after the appearance of the first, Mr.
<PB N="137" REF="028720_0135_0FDA62E1250372D8"/>Morris, who attempted those things in the poetical way, particularly a piece for musick, which was performed in private before some of the royal family, accidentally paid a visit to Mr. Pope, who, after the first civilities were over, inquired of him what news there was in the learned world; and what new pieces were brought to light? Morris replied, that there was little or nothing; or at least little or nothing worth notice: That there was indeed a thing come out called an Es∣say on Man, the first epistle, threatening more, for he had read it, and it was a most a∣bomicable piece of stuff, shocking poetry, un∣sufferable philosophy, no coherence, no con∣nexion at all. If I had thought (continued he) that you had not seen it, I would have brought it with me. Upon this Mr. Pope frankly told him, "that he had seen it before it went to press, for it was his own writing, a work of years, and the poetry such as he thought proper for the expression of the sub∣ject; on which side he did not imagine it would ever have been attacked, especially by any man pretending to knowledge in the har∣mony of numbers." This was like a clap of thunder to the mistaken bard: He reached his hat, and with a blush and a bow, took his leave of Mr. Pope, and never more ventured to shew his unlucky face there again.</P>
<P>When the army of Lewis XIV. of France was encamped in Flanders during his war with the confederates, the king used sometimes to reside at the head quarters himself. It hap∣pened, that a very fine horse, which he had lately purchased, was exercised before his tent,
<PB N="138" REF="028720_0136_0FDA62E2DA6CE480"/>and among others who had gathered round to see him, was a corporal, who having been that afternoon too free with aqua vitae, was become as great a man as his majesty. He had stroll∣ed up to the spot, and getting within the cir∣cle, put himself in an attitude of consequence, and after having some time made his observa∣tions with the air of a profound connoisse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrusts a quid of tobacco into his mouth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore it was as fine a creature as ever he saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and as well broke; then tottering up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>om who had been riding it, and was just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ounted, asked him who was the own∣er: At this moment the king came out from his tent, and overhearing the corporal's ques∣tion, with whom he had already been divert∣ed, told him courteously, that the horse was his: The corporal made his majesty a slight compliment by moving his hat, and then set∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his arms akimbo, told him, that his rea∣son for asking was, that he had taken a liking to the horse and was inclined to buy him. The king told him he had no intention to sell him, but if it would oblige him he would treat with him on the same spot the next morning. The corporal, thrusting out his hand, cried, a match; to which the king consented, and rode off, giving private orders that no punishment should be inflicted upon the corporal, but that he should be brought before him the next morning. In the morning, when the poor fel∣low was told what had passed, and conducted to the king's tent, he was seized by a dreadful panick, lest his insolence and drunkenness might cost him his life. Into the presence, however, he was carried; and the king, who
<PB N="139" REF="028720_0137_0FDA62E493BA1838"/>intended only some sport, asked him, if he was the man that would last night have bought his horse? No, an't please your majesty, says the fellow, that man went away at three o'clock this morning. Did he so? said the king (who understood that at three o'clock, sleep had substituted a sober man for one that was drunk) I am very glad that I have got so sen∣sible and decent a person as you are in his stead, and I hope he will never come back; for if I see him, I shall certainly resent his be∣haviour. So the corporal was dismissed with∣out farther reprehension.</P>
<P>Killegrew, was a man of very great humour and frequently diverted king Charles II. by his lively spirit of mirth and drollery. He was frequently at court, and had often access to king Charles, when admission was denied to the first peers in the realm. Amongst many other merry stories, the following is related of Killegrew. Charles II. who hated business as much as he loved pleasure, would often dis∣appoint the council by withdrawing his royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resence when they were met, by which their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ness was necessarily delayed, and many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> council much offended at the disrespect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them. It happened one day when the council were met, and had sat some time in expectation of his majesty, that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungovernable man, quitted the room in a passion, and acci∣dentally met with Killegrew, to whom he ex∣pressed himself irreverently of the king: Kil∣legrew bade his grace be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alm, for he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay a wager of a hundred pounds, that he
<PB N="140" REF="028720_0138_0FDA62F4244314C0"/>would make his majesty come to council in less than half an hour. Lauderdale being a little heated, and under the influence of sur∣prise, took him at his word: Kill egrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him what had happened; and added, "I know your majesty hates Lauderdale, though the necessity of your affairs obliges you to be∣have civilly to him; now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, for Lauderdale is a man so boundlessly av∣aricious, that rather than pay the hundred pounds lost in this wager, he will hang him∣self, and never plague you any more." The king was pleased with the archness of this ob∣servation, and answered, then Killegrew, I'll positively go; which he did.</P>
<P>The bishop of Soissous in France, who valued himself on the politeness of his address, and was remarkable for never having uttered a rude expression, was once, by an indiscretion, guil∣ty of a piece of rudeness, sufficient to make his good breeding be called in question: And which shews the precaution that is necessary to be used in speaking to strangers. This pre∣late was come at court, where observing a lady, who was extremely corpulent, talking to the queen, and at the other end of the room a very genteel youth of a very promising ap∣pearance, both of whom were utter strangers to him, he addressed himself to the young gen∣tleman, and with a soft insinuating air, after some compliments, asked him if he knew who that Fat Sow was, who was in discourse with
<PB N="141" REF="028720_0139_0FDA62F5655115D8"/>her majesty? Yes, my lord, replied the youth, with great modesty; that Sow is the ambas∣sadress of Sweden, and mother to the little pig who has the honour to speak to your lordship. At this answer the bishop was struck with con∣fusion, and humbly begged pardon, adding, that he could not help feeling the greatest esteem for a person, who had with such mildness re∣buked him for his brutality.</P>
<P>A few nights since I was in company (says the writer) with a gentleman that was in the road of Algiers some years ago, and was an eye and an ear witness to the following story. One day as some christian captives, who had been ransomed, were going to be discharg∣ed, the town cruizers brought in a Swedish vessel; one of them hearing it was of that na∣tion, and being from thence himself, was very desirous to see the crew, when to his great sur∣prise he saw his own father (who was master of the ship) in the company: The son knew the father, but the father who had lost him when a youth, knew not his son, having long given him up as dead. The son discovered him∣self, to the father who embraced him with great tenderness: But the recollection of their situa∣tion soon interrupted their joy, and introduced lamentation and despair.—At length the young man addressed himself to his father in this manner: "The slavery you are going into, will be insupportable to you, and soon put an end to your life, the thoughts of which are worse than death to me. I have been here a great many years, and know the country, the people and their work; if they will accept of
<PB N="142" REF="028720_0140_0FDA62F6E4CC4DA8"/>me in your room, I will go back into slavery, and you shall go home again:—I know if I should be able to raise friends, I shall be re∣deemed;—if not—God's will be done!" The Moors readily accepted the exchange; so the father returned to freedom and his home, and the son to toil and slavery. A memorable in∣stance of filial piety.</P>
<P>The vicar of Bray, in Berkshire, being a catholick under the reign of Henry VIII. and a protestant under Edward VI. a catholick a∣gain under queen Mary, and a protestant in the reign of queen Elizabeth, was reproached as the scandal of his gown, by turning from one religion to another; "I cannot help that:" replied the vicar, "but if I changed my religion, I am sure I have kept true to my principle, which is, to live and die the vicar of Bray."</P>
<P>Philips, the noted harlequin, was taken up in London on suspicion of debt, and dealt with the officer in the following manner: He first called for liquor in abundance, and treated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll about him, to the no small joy of the bailiff, who was rejoiced to have a calf that bled so well, (as they term it.) Harlequin made the honest bailiff believe he had six dozen of wine ready packed up, which he would send for, to drink while in custody, and likewife allow him sixpence a bottle for drinking it in his own chamber. Shoulderdab listened to the proposal with pleasure. The bailiff went to the place, as directed, and returned with joy, to hear that it was to be sent in the morning early. Accordingly it came by a porter, sweat∣ing
<PB N="143" REF="028720_0141_0FDA62FE720EE548"/>under his load: The turnkey called to his master, and told him the porter and hamper were come in: Very well, said he, then let nothing but the porter and hamper out. The porter performed his part very well: Came heavily in with an empty hamper, and seemed to go lightly out, with Philips on his back. He was dishampered at an alehouse on the water side, crossed the Thames, and soon after embarked for Ireland. He was very fond of this trick, and would take pride in his project, which was contrived long before he was taken, to be ready on such an emergency.</P>
