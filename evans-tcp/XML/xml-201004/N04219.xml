<HEAD>THE <HI>EXAMINER,</HI> OR, <HI>Gilbert</HI> against <HI>Tennent.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I had read over Mr. <HI>G. Ten∣nent</HI>'s three first Sermons on <HI>Rev.</HI> 3▪3. representing the <HI>Necessity of holding fast the Truth,</HI> with the <HI>Appendix,</HI> relating to the <HI>Moravian Errors,</HI> &amp;c. I immediately reviewed and compared therewith his <HI>famous</HI> Sermon preach'd at <HI>Nottingham</HI> upon <HI>the Danger of an Unconverted Ministry,</HI> on <HI>Mark</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 44. And must confess it is as impossible to reconcile them upon the Principles of <HI>Common Sense,</HI> as to unite the <HI>two Poles.</HI></P>
<P>But then putting on that Charity which <HI>is not easily provoked,</HI> and <HI>hopeth all Things,</HI> I endeavoured to con∣sider the three Sermons as a <HI>Retractation</HI> of the <HI>Notting∣ham</HI> Sermon; That altho' he did not expresly retract it, yet I would charitably cast it in this Light, for the sake of <HI>Catholick Unity,</HI> and because it seems hard for an <HI>High Priest</HI> to confess his <HI>Errors</HI> even once a Year, tho' he may love to be <HI>Father Confessor</HI> himself, and bring others to the Stool.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005200_0004_1016E28E08B73380"/>
But upon Enquiry, it is to be suspected that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> never design'd that these <HI>three Sermons</HI> should superceed the other; but that they should consist and tra∣vel together like good Companions. For it is plain that after Mr. <HI>T</HI>—had preached these Sermons at <HI>N. York,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1742, his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham</HI> receives a new Edition at <HI>Boston,</HI> from the <HI>second Edition</HI> printed at <HI>Phi∣ladelphia;</HI> by which it appears that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> or his Friends, instead of suppressing it, have been careful to propagate it, as his <HI>Master-Piece;</HI> and indeed it is a Master-Piece of it's kind: And not only so, but I'm credibly inform'd, that he has lately justified it, as containing the genuine Sentiments of his Soul; and I'm apt to think he has spo∣ken the Truth. And no wonder Mr. <HI>T.</HI> won't abate one Jot or Tittle of it, since Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> has judg'd it <HI>an unanswerable Piece:</HI> for <HI>his Counsel</HI> it seems with ma∣ny in these Days is, <HI>as if a Man had enquired at the O∣racle of GOD.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Querists, Part</HI> III, <HI>Page</HI> 5, take Notice, that it hath been observed that when it is Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s turn to speak, then Mr. <HI>G. Tennent</HI> is proclaimed the <HI>most able, most eminent Servant of Christ, and all his Associates or Party, spiritual Men, and faithful Ministers of Christ,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. And in the <HI>Examiner, Pag.</HI> 149, it is affirmed, that when Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> preached a Sermon at <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI> he told a numerous Audience, that there were but few faithful Ministers of Christ in these Parts; and if he must be plain and name them, it was the <HI>Tennents</HI> and their Adherents: The like he did at <HI>Fog's Mannor.</HI>
<P>On the other Hand, If their Turn comes to speak or write, then Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> is proclaimed the <HI>most able, and most eminent Ser∣vant of Christ.</HI>—When there is such an Hue and Cry after Pha∣risees, we would be glad to know, whether it would be safe for the other side to trumpet one anothers Praises so loudly and highly as this side doth, without being in Danger of being taken up for Pharisees, and having the Crows Eggs cast in their Teeth? because Christ saith to those Pharisees that were offended at him for heal∣ing a Man on the Sabbath, John 5, 44. <HI>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another?</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005200_0005_1016E250F4B08A68"/>
It is plain also, That Mr. <HI>T—t</HI>'s zealous Advocates here and elsewhere, have by way of <HI>Charity,</HI> dispers'd about the Country great Numbers of the last Edition, tending to corrupt the Minds of People from the <HI>Sim∣plicity which is in Christ,</HI> and to promote that <HI>Confusion</HI> and <HI>separating Spirit</HI> which he himself has been instru∣mental of raising in many of our Places; <HI>Which the Lord rebuke in his Time.</HI> For many are fully perswaded that Mr. <HI>T—t</HI>'s Sermon and Practice upon it, have sown the Seeds of all that <HI>Discord, Intrusion, Confusion, Sepa∣ration, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies,</HI> &amp;c. that have been springing up in so many of the Towns and Churches <HI>thro' the Province for two Years past.</HI> Who hath been so instrumental to hatch the <HI>Cockatrice</HI> as himself, tho' at the same Time he could gravely advise others to <HI>crush it in the Egg</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his printed Letter to Mr. <HI>Dickinson.</HI></NOTE>. His <HI>Principiis obsta</HI> is given out too late in the Day: That is to say, <HI>After Vows make Enquiry,</HI> instead of <HI>letting alone Contention before it be medled with.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever will take the Pains to consider the main Scope of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> will find the Principles of it to be subversive of Gospel Order, the publick Ministry and publick Means of Education; and what have we more? What could <HI>touch the Apple of our Eye</HI> like this fatal Blow. It is a <HI>Blow at the Root.</HI></P>
<P>Take here by the Way, the Sentiments of the <HI>Synod</HI> in the <HI>Examination,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Page</HI> 81, <HI>viz</HI> <Q>We look up∣on Mr. <HI>T—'s</HI> printed Sermon preach'd at <HI>Nottingham</HI> to be a notable Instance of their sowing Seeds of Divi∣sion, and we charge him with perverting Scripture, uncharitable rash Judging of the Body of the Clergy of this Generation in the Lump, and encouraging Facti∣ons and Disorders therein; and say we, This, This, This, and the like Speeches thereunto, filled the Minds of many People against their stated Pastors, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005200_0006_1016E290AAA34C68"/>
Furthermore, I can't find any Room for rational Chri∣stian Charity to think that Mr. <HI>T</HI>—ever intended that his last Discourses should be interpreted as a Retracta∣tion of his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and therefore as long as he holds two Sett of Principles as opposite to one another, as the heathenish Principles of a good and an evil god, and until he makes a publick and solemn Re∣tractation of <HI>that Sermon,</HI> it is but just and equal to set <HI>Gilbert</HI> against <HI>Tennent,</HI> and <HI>judge him out of his own Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Having reviewed the <HI>florid Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s late Discourses, subscribed by <HI>Six Reve∣rend Divines,</HI> <Q>of whose Opinion it's said much Use is made in the Country,</Q> I stumbled at the Threshold again, when I could not find one Word to help out my Charity towards reconciling Mr. <HI>T—t</HI> with himself: But they set it forth as an Epistle of Commendation of this their <HI>dear Brother</HI> and his Works without any Ex∣ception.</P>
<P>They call his Performance, <Q><HI>A Labour of Love and Effort of holy Zeal of One that has learn'd to contend earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and with the Light of a wise Master-Builder, on the Foundation which Christ and his Apostles have laid.</HI></Q> The Metaphor would run as smoothly in the Words of the great <HI>Apostle, A Workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly</HI> dividing <HI>the Word of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>They say further, <Q>When this our <HI>dear Brother, whose Praise is in the Churches</HI> thro' the Provinces, visited us at <HI>Boston,</HI> two Years ago, and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> entred into his Labours here; it pleased God in a wonderful Manner to crown his abundant Services with Success, in the Conviction, and (we trust) Conversion of many Souls: As there∣fore the Name of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> is greatly endear'd to us, so we beseech our ascended SAVIOUR, the Head
<PB N="7" REF="005200_0007_1016E25284268000"/>of the Church long to continue him for a burning Light, and extensive Blessing to our Provinces; and in particular to use this faithful, judicious, and season∣able Endeavour of his Servant, for a Guard and De∣fence about his own sacred Truths, and his glorious Work in the midst of us, which too many are ready to speak evil of and oppose.</Q></P>
<P>One must be cloathed with Charity down to the Foot to think that these <HI>Reverend Gentlemen</HI> had not seen Mr. <HI>Tennent's</HI> Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> &amp;c. which stands in direct Opposition to some Parts of his Doctrine and Con∣duct exprest in these Sermons and elsewhere, as I shall demonstrate in parallel Lines.</P>
<P>If therefore they had well confidered and compared the one with the other, how is it reconcileable with the <HI>Simplicity that is in CHRIST,</HI> to represent Mr. <HI>T</HI>— as such a <HI>burning Light,</HI> when his Spots are so conspi∣cuous to the most cursory Reader?— One might expect that if Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> had not the Ingenuity to say, <HI>I Re∣pent,</HI> that at least these <HI>Reverend Gentlemen</HI> would have attempted a Reconciliation for him, if they think as <HI>Protestants</HI> generally do that <HI>Infallibility may mistake.</HI></P>
<P>Nay ought they not to have said publickly (as it is affirmed One of them said in private Conversation) that Mr. <HI>T. was now come Right:</HI> I suppose he meant <HI>Right about;</HI> which implies, that <HI>he had been Wrong.</HI> But it seems no Man dar'd or car'd to say unto him, <HI>Why dost thou such Things?</HI> Such is the Danger of <HI>ha∣ving Men's Persons in Admiration, because of Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>It seems, Such a prime Instrument of <HI>the Work</HI> that has been going on in the <HI>American</HI> Provinces for the two last Years, must be judged infallible and supported with the highest <HI>Encomiums</HI> of Six most Reverend Mi∣nisters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Colman <HI>thus magnifies him to Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>in a Let∣ter published in the first Weekly Paper printed at</HI> Glasgow, <HI>viz.</HI> We receiv'd him (Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>) just as we did you, as an Angel of Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<P><HI>Likewise Mr.</HI> Cooper <HI>in a Letter printed in the</HI> Weekly History, <HI>No. 2. calls him,</HI> Dear Mr. <HI>Tennent.</HI> He came <HI>(says he)</HI> in the Fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel indeed. He was with us several Months. Many Thousands were awakened, and I believe many truly Converted. There is quite another Face of Religion in this Town, as well as many Places in the Country. Many Ministers as well as People greatly quickened. Blessed be GOD, who put it into your Heart to move him to come; and inclin'd his Heart to come and help us. <HI>See Mr.</HI> Whitefield's <HI>Remarks on the State of Religion in</HI> New England.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="005200_0008_1016E292342E9CB0"/>I heartily wish he was more worthy for whom they have done this; and that they themselves had not in this <HI>Labour of Love</HI> to their <HI>dear &amp; honoured Brother,</HI> betrayed too great a liking of what is common∣ly called <HI>this Work.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Reverend Gentlemen</HI> say, That <Q><HI>this our dear Brother visited us at</HI> Boston <HI>two Years ago, and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>enter'd into his Labours.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It's true Mr. <HI>T</HI>— visited these Parts about that Time, and the Visit was full of Extraordinaries<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Language of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s Journey into <HI>New-England</HI> was plainly this, that no Man was like-minded, and capable to <HI>Water where Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>had planted.</HI> His coming among us was really judged by many wise and good Men, a bare-faced Affront to the <HI>Body of the Clergy of this Generation.</HI></NOTE>: His Pro∣gress thro' this Province savour'd more of worldly Pomp and Grandeur, than the Humility of the meek and lowly <HI>Jesus:</HI> He came eating and drinking, galloping over the Country with his <HI>Congregatio de propagandâ,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Magna Comitante Caterva,</HI> with a Troop of 20 or 30 Horse, entring into <HI>other Men's Labours,</HI> and <HI>devouring their Livings, having all Things in common.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005200_0009_1016E2552990C328"/>
He came — in <HI>the Spirit of Mr. Whitefield</HI> in∣deed, when Proclamation was made before him as Visitor or Vicar-General, The Rev. Mr. <HI>T.</HI> designs to preach in such a City or Church to Day, and to Morrow in ano∣ther, and continue in a Third <HI>and get Gain,</HI> without the least Regard to the stated Pastors of these Churches, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nolens;</HI> pleading <HI>Extraordinaries</HI> for suspending Scripture-Rules.</P>
<P>He came <HI>in the Spirit of Mr. Whitefield,</HI> when he treated the Body of the Ministry in this Province with so much Neglect and Contempt as he did<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Journal.</NOTE>, not only in not suffering himself to hear any of them, no not in <HI>Boston</HI> it self except once or twice; but also in cruelly censuring them in general and raising Jealousies in the Minds of People of their Faithful Ministers even to that Degree, as hath ended in a <HI>Spirit</HI> of dreadful <HI>Separation</HI> in many Places.</P>
<P>But then are these Rev <HI>Messirs.</HI> of the the same Mind, Spirit and Judgment? Did they come in the <HI>same Spirit</HI> when Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> in his <HI>Journal,</HI> Part 3d, Page 63, saith, <HI>"These bodily Convulsions, I believe come from the De∣vil; who, now the Work of GOD is going on, wants to bring an evil Report upon it?"</HI> And seeing nothing is more evident than that Mr. <HI>T.</HI>— is the grand Instru∣ment of promoting those animal Convulsions into which many of our New-Converts have fallen, and upon which great Stress is laid by many in the Work of Conversion. <Q><HI>Do not they take the Devils Part, who use Methods to further such sad Appearances, and condemn them for Opposers of GOD's Work, who labour to undeceive People about these Fits, by ascribing them to inferiour Causes?</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005200_0010_1016E293CB0D4CC8"/>
<Q>But is it not Matter of Fact when many of the Hearers of some Preachers fell into Convulsion-like Fits and roared, that the usual Note of such Preachers then was, <HI>Will any of you come to Christ?</HI> When at the same Time they pronounced heavy Curses upon such as took not such Fits, as being hard-hearted Pharisees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Examiner,</HI> P. 98.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Again, These Reverend Gentlemen, say, <HI>This our dear Brother enter'd into Mr.</HI> Whitefield's <HI>Labours.</HI> That is in other Words, Mr. <HI>Whitefield planted</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tennent watered;</HI> as if the Gospel had never been planted and watered in this Wilderness before these Rev. <HI>Messirs</HI> introduced the Practice of <HI>itenerary Preaching.</HI></P>
<P><Q>But pray will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell the World what great Success had Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> or himself, but where they had Opportunity to enter into other Men's Labours? And who planted and watered Congregations for them to crow of their Success therein? For in <HI>Maryland, Virginia</HI> and <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where Ministers are com∣paratively scarce, what News of Mr. <HI>W</HI>—'s great Success<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See P. 90.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>These Reverend Gentlemen conclude their Preface by saying, <Q><HI>We beseech our ascended Saviour, the Head of the Church in particular to use this faithful, judi∣cious and seasonable Endeavour of his Servant, for a Guard and Defence about his own sacred Truths, and his glorious Work in the midst of us, which too many are ready to speak evil of and oppose.</HI></Q> I would cha∣ritably hope that these <HI>Rev. Divines</HI> don't pretend by the last Paragraph to patronize and defend all the <HI>Extra∣ordinaries</HI> that have passed current for the <HI>Work of God,</HI> in this Time of Strife of Tongues and Confusion of <HI>Babel;</HI> or to Brand all with the black Character of <HI>Op∣posers of His Work,</HI> who are Enemies to <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="005200_0011_1016E29C5285DA10"/><HI>Delusion.</HI> There are many wild Disorders and Confusions in some of our Churches at this Day which really resem∣ble the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Disorders in the Times of the Apo∣stles. Necessity is therefore laid upon the faithful Mini∣sters of CHRIST to bear publick and <HI>seasonable</HI> Testimony against them; and pity it is these Rev. Gentlemen let slip so good an Opportunity as this to do it. But seeing they refuse to give a differencing Account of <HI>the Work,</HI> it is well that one of the Country Ministers hath since faithfully done it to their Hand, in one of their Pulpits.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Ashley</HI> in his Sermon on CHARITY, preached in the Church in <HI>Brattle-Street.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><Q>That the Reader may be able to form a right Judg∣ment of the contending Parties, let him resolve this plain Query, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the Opposers of Enthusi∣astick Pranks, set up under the Name of Reformations or Religion; or the warm Admirers of and Contenders for such, deserve the Name of <HI>Opposers of God</HI>'s <HI>Work?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I could find no other Key but that in the Sermon upon <HI>the little Foxes</HI> in the End of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s late Treatise, to let him out of the Labyrinth into which he had plunged himself. Where it is said Pag. 8, 9. <HI>Foxes have Holes. Foxes have most commonly many Ways and Passages to come out at, because if one should be stopt or closed up, they may have another to creep out at.—Foxes are crafty, and know how to dissemble.— Foxes that they may not be so easily ensnared, seldom run right forward, but run to one Side, and to the other Side and cross ways.</HI>—They have a sly Way <HI>of creeping into other Holes, and of turning other Animals,</HI> (it may be said) out of their rightful Possessions, so it is with respect to— for of this Sort are <HI>these which creep into Houses,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.6. And it may be generally said of them, <HI>that they creep into setled Ministries and Congregations, and turn out those that are Orthodox amongst them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005200_0012_1016E295A5DEE2A0"/>
It is evident that Mr. <HI>T</HI>— design'd by translating this Sermon, that it should be used as a Key to open the cunning, crafty Intreagues and Evasions of the <HI>Moravians</HI> in propagating their <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>frightful Errors.</HI> See <HI>Page</HI> 65, 100.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>T.</HI> must excuse me if I turn the same Key upon himself, to let him out of many Inconsistencies and Con∣tradictions charged upon him; <HI>I expect that he will make use of Fox-like Shifts to evade the Discovery.</HI>—Witness his <HI>second Letter</HI> printed in the <HI>Pensylvania Gazette</HI> of <HI>Sept.</HI> 2.1742.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 53. <HI>Of the Necessity,</HI> &amp;c. False Teachers are won't to use private sculking Methods; <HI>they creep into Houses, and lead captive silly Women,</HI> and often by them their Husbands, and others are corrupted.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall follow the same Method Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> has taken with the <HI>Moravians;</HI> and compare his Sermon preach'd at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> with his late <HI>Discourses</HI> and <HI>Appendix,</HI> in <HI>distinct Columns;</HI> or, in other Words, set <HI>Gilbert</HI> against <HI>Tennent</HI> for the Readers ease in finding out the Truth.</P>

<P><HI>Page</HI> 8. <HI>Of his Serm. at</HI> Nottingham, he scarce owns a Possibility of profiting under an unconverted Ministry— when he says, <Q>Is a <HI>dead Man</HI> fit to bring others to Life? Sad Experience verifies the unprofitable∣ness of the Ministry of un∣converted Men. Look in∣to the Congregations of un∣converted Ministers, and see what a sad Security reigns there: Not a Soul convinced that can be heard of, for many Years toge∣ther. — What if some Instances could be shewn of unconverted Ministers being Instrumental in con∣vincing Persons of their lost Estate? The Thing is very rare and extraor∣dinary. And for what I know, as many Instances might be given, of Satan's convincing Persons by his Temptations. Indeed it's
<PB N="16" REF="005200_0016_1016E2BCEDBD0BA0"/>a kind of Chance-Medley, both in respect of his Fa∣ther and his Children, when any such Event happens; and is'nt this the Reason why a Work of Conviction and Conversion has been so rarely heard of for a long Time in the Churches, till of late, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Bulk of her spiritual Guides were stone-blind and stone-dead?</Q></P>

<P><Q><HI>That Charity which thinketh no evil;</HI> surely then it will speak none. — <HI>That Charity</HI> which enclines to Mildness, Candour and Courtesy in Speech and Behaviour, it <HI>behaveth not it self unseemly.

Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thy self?</HI></Q></P>
<P>HAVING given the Reader a summary View of this Reverend Gentleman's inconsistent <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Principles;</HI> I shall proceed to represent his Conduct in the same Light; and to apply his own Words with re∣spect to Mr. <HI>Spangenberg,</HI> a <HI>Moravian Missionary</HI> (<HI>Page</HI> 99, <HI>Appendix</HI>) <Q>I have seen and heard of so much in∣consistent Conduct in him and others of that Sect, that I can hardly avoid a Jealousy of his Sincerity.

<P>But why doth this <HI>Gentleman</HI> deny to those <HI>Moravian Gentlemen</HI> the same Liberty he takes himself; to say, and unsay Things as liketh him? More especially seeing he himself has had greater Advantages of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth in a <HI>Protestant</HI> Country, than the <HI>Moravian's who have just emerged out of the Dark∣ness and Errors of Propery.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>T.</HI> complains bitterly of Mr. <HI>Batener</HI>'s contradict∣ing himself in <HI>his Hearing</HI> in the Space of Two or

But let Mr. <HI>T. first cast out the Beam out of his own Eye:</HI> For is it not as culpa∣ble for a <HI>leading Divine</HI> of <HI>New-Brunswick</HI> to contradict himself often in the Space of Two or Three Years, as for Mr. <HI>Betaner</HI> to do it once in the space of Two or Three Minutes in <HI>his hearing.

<P>Yea, and all such-like sudden and rapturous Con∣versions are equally pre∣sumptuous and delusive: But as a <HI>sorry Mushroom</HI> of a Nights growth.</P>
<P>Every Reader of com∣mon Observation will find the Transition very easy from the <HI>Moravians</HI> to many of the <HI>Converts</HI> now a-days, who talk boldly of their <HI>high Joys,</HI> and <HI>full Assurances, under a Mask of Humility; at the same Time trusting in themselves that they are righteous, and despising others.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Again,</HI> Page 108. <Q>I think it looks exceeding black in the <HI>Moravians</HI> to slight speculative Knowledge, so as they do which they call Head-Knowledge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Is not speculative Know∣ledge the same for Sub∣stance with that which 18 saving, only destitute of it's Influence upon Heart and Practice?</Q></P>

<HI>Ibid.</HI> <Q>Don't the Mora∣vians begin with the Affections first? And is this fair Dealing?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Do they not endea∣vour to insinuate them∣selves into People's Af∣fections first by Smiles, <HI>&amp;c. And in Page</HI> 65. Do any esteem the Mo∣ravian Sect because they <HI>Smile</HI> generally and ap∣pear loving? But Bre∣thren, is not this <HI>Judas-like</HI> to betray us with a Kiss? For while they shew such Love, they draw pious People into Error, and so set them a quarreling with one ano∣ther; shall we suffer them to smile us out, of our Princples. Then I'm sure we are poorly grounded in them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> <Q>Do not they take special Care to apply to young Persons, Females and ignorant People who are full of Affection?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who do they imitate
<PB N="29" REF="005200_0029_1016E2B47A6FC338"/>in attacking the weaker Part of Man, <HI>viz.</HI> the Passions? and the weaker Sex first, but the Devil, the Father of Lies and Errors? Did not he deal thus with our first Parents, and by the weaker Sex seduced <HI>Adam.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 107. <Q>And don't they refuse generally to reason upon Points in Re∣ligion whereby one might convince another, and leave People to be pro∣selyted by Sight only? It is politick in them in∣deed to wave Reasoning, and shun Discovery, for their Principles will bear neither.</Q> <HI>And in Page</HI> 65.</P>
<P><Q>My Soul is grieved to see the childish Fickle∣ness of the Sons &amp; Daugh∣ters of this Generation! who are toss'd about with every Wind of Doctrine; who are smil'd out of their Religion, without being able to offer one solid Reason for their Change.</Q></P>

<HI>See Page</HI> 58 <Q>Chil∣dren are fond of new Things, of Things that look bright, tho' they be of little Value: Thus, young Novices in Chri∣stianity, who are just be∣ginning the christian Course, ignorant in a great measure as to chri∣stian Principles, but full of Affection and Self-Con∣ceit; when a Moravian comes among them, sets down a while, and looks very harmless and inno∣cent &amp; sober, gives some Smiles, and talks about the Blood of Christ in their mystical Way, and of Love; Love! O brave! O what a fine Man is this?</Q></P>

Hath not Mr. <HI>T—</HI> de∣claimed more publickly and fiercely against Learning than the <HI>Moravians,</HI> when he pronounced his <HI>Anathe∣ma</HI> against the <HI>publick Aca∣demies,</HI> and poured Con∣tempt upon a <HI>learned Clergy,</HI> calling them <HI>Letter-learn∣ed,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Why then do we hear so much of the spiritual and mystical Sense of Scripture? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005200_0028_1016E2CD696A4F68"/>
Pray, Has not this been the constant Practice of the <HI>Itinerants</HI> to address and move the Passions first?</P>
<P>Is not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> a principal Mover and Promoter of the Passio∣nate-Religion, now prevail∣ing among so many? Is it not as unfair Dealing in the <HI>Itinerants</HI> as in the Mora∣vians?</P>
<P>Who can help <HI>smiling</HI> at this, that considers what is past and now is?—Strange that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> should complain of the <HI>Moravian Smiles</HI> in religious Matters! when it is notorious that he himself not only <HI>smil'd,</HI> but <HI>laughed heartily</HI> over his Converts, even while they were <HI>under a preparatory Work of the Law.</HI> And his Followers have practiced upon him, and not been ashamed to ex∣press their Joy at—by loud Laughing, even in the so∣lemn Assemblies. Is not this <HI>ludere cum Sacris?</HI> an un∣justifiable Practice in one, as well as another.</P>
<P>And is not this Practice exactly correspondent with the Practice of Mr. <HI>T</HI>—and other heady <HI>Itinerants,</HI> which <HI>creep into Houses, and lead captive silly Women?</HI></P>

It is evident to a Demon∣stration that they have had most Success <HI>among Females</HI> and <HI>young ignorant People.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Passage is so very applicable to the <HI>Itine∣rants</HI> in general, that I should have taken it for a Representation (not to say Refutation) of their Conduct if Mr. <HI>T</HI>—had not taught me to apply it to the <HI>Mora∣vians.</HI></P>
<P>This Rev. Gentleman had forgot surely the <HI>Motto</HI> of his own Party, viz. <HI>An∣swer him not a Word,</HI> when he wrote this, it is thought by some that <HI>their Strength</HI> was herein.</P>
<P>Even so many judicious and serious Christians are grieved at the Heart to see the <HI>childish Fickleness;</HI> of many Professors at this Day, who are as Children <HI>tossed to and fro,</HI> and <HI>carried a∣bout with diverse &amp; strange Doctrines, separating them∣selves,</HI> and <HI>having Men's Persons in Admiration;</HI> with∣out being able <HI>to offer one solid Reason for their Change.</HI></P>

It is a moving Argument and Proof that People, are not so well taught in this Land as is pretended, but have now as much need as ever to have their Minds in∣structed as well as their Pas∣sions moved.</P>

<P><HI>Page</HI> 107. <Q>Certainly, <HI>says he,</HI> we should adhere in∣violably to the Principles we have been instructed in, until we find better, which we should be always-ready to receive upon proper Conviction, which is not to be attained by the Sight of the Grimaces of Strangers, or by immediate Revelations or Enthusiasms, but by Scrip∣ture Reason and Argument." And in <HI>Page</HI> 52. "He directs in order to hold fast Christ's precious Truth, it is needful to <HI>wave a positive Conclusion, respecting the good State of Strangers, when we have not sufficient Evi∣dences for it, in respect of their Principles, Experiences, and Practice.</HI> Rash Judging either Way is certainly unreasonable and prejudicial: When Persons do speedily, without sufficient Grounds conclude <HI>Strangers,</HI> who come among them, to be Pious, and perhaps eminently so because of their fair Appearances in Behaviour, without examining their Principles. By this rash Method of proceeding their Affections are apt to be unreasonably
<PB N="31" REF="005200_0031_1016E2B72545D6F0"/>engaged in their Favour; and these being inflamed do give a secret wrong Byass to their Judgment, and thus they lay themselves open to all manner of Delusion.</Q></P>
<P>I am confident the impartial Reader is full convinced by this time that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> has drawn his own Picture to the Life, by the Representation he has given of the Principles and Practices of the <HI>Moravians,</HI> and that I have only set the Mirror in such a position that He and his Ad∣herents may see themselves and be ashamed. But if they are blinded with Self-love, Admiration, Conceit, Party-Zeal, and the like, and will not, or cannot see their own likeness. I believe others have so much of a Spirit of dis∣cerning as to see that Mr. <HI>T</HI>—and his Partizans as nearly resemble the Character here given of the <HI>Moravians as one Crow's Egg does another</HI> (to use his own homely Com∣parison.)</P>
<P>The Reader may take this Examination as an help to discover <HI>what is Truth</HI> in the <HI>late Religious Commotion</HI> in this Country, and he will find it to be just that which the <HI>Opposers</HI> so called, are zealous to maintain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Or∣der of the Gospel, and the sacred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God. Strip <HI>this Work</HI> of its <HI>Extraordinary's,</HI> and you will discern what is <HI>the Work of God,</HI> from that which is added to it <HI>by Art</HI> and <HI>Man's device.</HI> <Q>Pray what is there extraordinary on one side more that t'other; but what is justly to be exploded, <HI>viz.</HI> extraordinary Errors, Disorders, Intrusions, rash Censures, Clamours, Excla∣mations, vain glorious Boastings, Fits, Pretence of Sights and Visions, Roarings, Tremblings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Com∣pare Mr. <HI>T</HI>—with himself, and shave off his Extraordi∣nary's (turning the edge of his own Weapon upon him∣self) and <HI>his Strength will go from him, and he will be like any other Man; a Man Subject to like Passions as we are.</HI> I can't find but that the <HI>New-Brunswick Party</HI> are fallible as other Men, and chargeable with as many Errors, Intru∣sions, Contradictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as their Neighbours, <Q>whom they are ready to condemn as <HI>Enemies of God's Work</HI> and <HI>Enemies of Religion</HI> meerly for opposing their Errors and real in Discretions:" Whereas the true Interest of Re∣ligion is doubtless served by such Opposition.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005200_0032_1016E2D2D6CF08F8"/>
I know of no <HI>shorter Method</HI> to open the Eyes of <HI>blind party-Zealots,</HI> and convince them of the bad Tendency of extraordinary Self-Conceit, Dominion, rash Judging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than to bring them home to their own Doors, and turn these edge Tools upon themselves; prove them now here∣with, and you will find these crucified Gentlemen have yet as much Sensation and are as ready to <HI>cry out of Dan∣ger</HI> as any of their abused Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moravians</HI> it seems treated Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> in the same uncharitable, censorious, imperious, divisive Manner in which he himself has treated the <HI>Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</HI> and then the Spirit appears to him in a most frightful Shape, and must be avoided. <HI>Now it is come up∣on thee, thou faintest: And it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</HI></P>
<P>It is generally tho't that Mr. <HI>D—pt's</HI> clamorous Preaching in <HI>Boston</HI> against unconverted Ministers, espe∣cially at <HI>C—p</HI>'s Hill, tended more to open the Mouths of some <HI>Reverend leading Ministers</HI> there, to <HI>forbid the mad∣ness of the Prophet,</HI> than seven Men that can render a Reason. Therefore let the Clergy as well as Laity <HI>bear one another's Burdens,</HI> and <HI>remember them that are in Bonds as bound with them, and as being themselves also in the Body. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye even so to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In fine,</HI> I must earnestly advise Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> to retract his famous Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and call in the several Editions of it, for 'till then it is as impossible to reconcile <HI>Gilbert</HI> with <HI>Tennent</HI> as to mingle Light with Darkness, <HI>a double minded Man is unstable in all his Ways:</HI> Nay, I think he ought in Conscience to make a solemn Retracta∣tion of it and cry <HI>Peccavi,</HI> (and all such Changlings with him.) For it is a meer <HI>Incendiary</HI> wherever it tracks abroad and nothing but the <HI>Fire</HI> can purge and purify it.</P>
<P><HI>If any Mans Work abide which he hath built upon the true Foundation which is Christ, he shall receive a Reward. If any Mans Work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by Fire.</HI></P>
