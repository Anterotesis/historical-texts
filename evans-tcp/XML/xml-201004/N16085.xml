<HEAD><HI>Observation on the Articles of Confederation,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BY these Articles, it clearly appears to have been intended by the Parties, that Congress should be the supreme sovereign Power, in all Cases, and that their Acts and Proceedings should be supremely efficacious, as much as any sovereign Acts whatsoever.—Some Persons may imagine, that no Acts can be Sovereign Acts, without a King, as in Great-Britain, and other Nations ruled by Kings; but it is not the Name or Per∣son of a King, which makes him the Sovereign, or which makes his Acts supreme and absolute, but he becomes sovereign, and his Acts become supreme, by the Constitution, or by the People assenting to his possessing and exercising the sove∣reign and supreme Power.—It is very plain, that a free People, of any Nation or Country, may lodge the sovereign and supreme Authority, for their own Government, in a Number or Body of Men, without Regard to a King, or the Name of a King, or any single Person.—It was accordingly meant by the Parties to the Articles of Confederation, that Congress should possess and exercise the sovereign and supreme Power over all the United States in Confederation; and that without such Possession and Exercise, the Union and Confederation of the States must be defective and incomplete.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="020600_0003_0FB05146D4E0B230" MS="y"/>A few Remarks, taken from the British Union, may be of Use, to cast some Light on the Ame∣rican Articles of Union.—In the Union between England and Scotland, the Scotch retained their former Laws and their former Courts of Justice; but after the Union, their Laws were to be all made in the Parliament of Great-Britain; for it would be inconsistent with the Idea of a complete Union, under one Legislature, of King, Lords, and Commons, legislating at Westminster, that the Scotch should, at Home, still be their own Legislators, as before the Union; and though they considered that the King, Lords, and Commons, composing the Legislature of England, were, by their Constitution, as absolute, and might, on Occasions, be as arbitrary and oppressive as the Grand Turk; and that after the Union, and even after the Accession of sixty-one Members, sixteen Lords, and forty-five Commoners from Scotland, the British Legislature would still, by their Con∣stitution, be as absolute as before, and might, on Occasions, be oppressive; they nevertheless, for the Sake of a complete and consistent Union, chose to have their Representatives in the British Parliament, and to have their Laws, in Time to come, from that Parliament; stipulating at the same Time, that Laws concerning the Regulation of Trade, Customs, and Excise, were to be the same in Scotland as in England; but all other Laws in Use in Scotland, were to remain in Force after the Union, but alterable by the Parliament of Great-Britain; and that Laws concerning public
<PB N="4" REF="020600_0004_0FB05148799AC7C8"/>
Right, Policy, and civil Government, should be made the same throughout the whole united Kingdom, but no Alteration should be made in Laws concerning private Right, except for the evident Utility of the Subjects in Scotland.</P>
<P>Though the Circumstances of the British Union were not similar to the Circumstances of the American Union, and the Parties in the British Union were not <HI>in pari Casu</HI> with the Parties in the American Union, the main Point in the Bri∣tish Union being to subject the Scotch to the Parliament of England, to be thereafter composed of English and Scotch; and the Parties to the American Union having no King, Lords, or Com∣mons to be subject to, or governed by, yet still the following Remarks, arising from the Consti∣tution of the British Union, may be useful to show the Defects of the American Union.</P>
<P N="1">I. If it had been reserved to the Scotch, in some or any particular Cases or Case, to make Regulations for themselves, after the Union, and that in such particular Cases reserved, the Parlia∣ment of Great-Britain should not interfere; such a Reservation would have been inconsistent with the Union, and should soon occasion much con∣fusion.</P>
<P N="2">II. If the British Treaty for an Union, had only declared an Union generally, and that the King of England should, under such general Union, be the sole Arbiter of Peace and War, for Scotland as well as England, and that the Scotch should aid and assist England in all Wars, offensive
<PB N="5" REF="020600_0005_0FB0514AA6FB7248"/>
and defensive; but without infringing or violating the legislative Right of Scotland, within its own Limits; such a Stipulation would be extremely absurd, and would soon occasion much Confusion, because if any legislative Right had been left with Scotland, after the Union, there would have been no End of legislating Pretentions, on various Emergencies and Occasions, nor any precise Boundary left between the legislative and executive Powers, under the Union.</P>
<P N="3">III. If the Articles of the British Union had stipulated nothing concerning the Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Customs, and Excise, or the Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government, and had not enacted that such Laws should, in Time coming, be the same in Scotland as in England, this would have occasioned the utmost Confusion, by Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Customs, and Excise and concerning pub∣lic Right, Policy, and civil Government in Scot∣land, being different from, and clashing with, or derogatory to those Laws in England.</P>
<P>So much for Remarks upon the British Union, as a Kind of Introduction to the following Ob∣servations on the Articles of the American Union, and those Articles, in a political Sense, truly appear to be improperly penned, in various Par∣ticulars herein after observed upon:</P>
<P N="1">I. The Stipulation, that each State retains it's Sovereignty and Independence, &amp;c. (as in Article 1st) appears to be wrong. Under the Idea of a political Union of thirteen several States confede∣rating
<PB N="6" REF="020600_0006_0FB0514C0E4657B8"/>
together, the Sovereignty of any individual State ought not to have been considered or ex∣pressed to be retained by such individual State, because no Sovereignty ought to be supposed to exist in any individual State after the Union, the only Sovereignty which could be useful or of Importance being the United Sovereignty, and of course, the whole Sovereignty of the Thirteen United States ought to be lodged with, and con∣centered in the Congress, as being the supreme Body or Tribunal, constituted for the Purpose of possessing the united Sovereignties of the Thirteen several United States.</P>
<P N="2">II. If this is just, it will appear, that after the Union, no individual State ought to be it's own Legislator, but that the Laws of each State ought to be made and passed in Congress.—Perhaps this would not have been relished by the individual States, at the Time of the Articles of Union entered into; but now, after some Experience had under those Articles, during which Experience, various Events are said to have happened, to show the Inconvenience of individual States making their own Laws, <HI>ad Libitum,</HI> without regarding Con∣gress; perhaps the individual States will not consider an Alteration to be made in this Respect, either by themselves or Congress, severally or jointly, as any Infringement or Violation of the legislative Right of any individual State, but will consider it as a proper and even necessary Altera∣tion for the Benefit of the Union, and for render∣ing it more consistent and more complete.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="020600_0007_0FB0514DD34C23C8"/>III. If it is considered to be too much for indi∣vidual States to give up what is called their So∣vereignty, their legislative Right, still they may be willing and satisfied to have the Exercise of such their sovereign and legislative Rights modi∣fied and abridged, or limited so far that no Law or Laws, Regulation or Regulations, to be made by any individual State, in Time coming, shall be valid, or of any Force or Effect, without the Assent of Congress first had and interposed there∣unto.—If this Matter is suffered to continue, as it was left, under the Articles of Union, it will then be clear, that the individual States of the Union chuse to keep up an absurd <HI>Imperium in Imperio,</HI> by individual Sovereignties, and legisla∣tive Rights, militating against, and destructive of the Authority of Congress, which ought to be the only sovereign, supreme, and absolute Autho∣rity, over, in, and throughout every Part of the United States.</P>
<P>Upon this Head it is unnecessary to mention the natural Distinctions between Laws and Re∣gulations of one Kind and those of another Kind, between the Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Customs, and Excise, and the Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government, or to mention that such Laws and Regulations ought to be the same every where, throughout the Whole of the United States, because the Thing is plain and obvious; and if the Doctrine above laid down, is applied to the making an Alteration in the Exercise of Legislation, such Alteration will
<PB N="8" REF="020600_0008_0FB0514F1D3ED4E8"/>
prevent or remedy the Inconveniencies arising from the former Exercise of Legislation, under the Articles of Union, as well in Regard to Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Customs, and Excise, as Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government.</P>
<P>The Case that is said to have happened in the State of Massachusetts, after that State had made a Navigation Act, subjecting all Foreigners to pay double Duties, a heavy Tonage, and high Light-Money, in the Ports of that State, is a deplorable Instance of the Absurdity of any individual State making Laws for itself, for imposing Duties on Ships and Merchandize, when, in the Ports of other individual States of the Union, no such Du∣ties had been imposed, or existed; and the Con∣sequence was, that every foreign Ship destined for the Massachusetts, during the Continuance of the said Duties, went to other Ports, where they could deal to greater Advantage, and thereby Merchan∣dize of immense or very considerable Value, which would have been exchanged for the Massachusetts Produce, to the great Increase of their Revenue, was diverted into other Channels, and lost to the State of Massachusetts.</P>
<P>This Case alone (though there are other absurd Cases which might be stated) is sufficient to show the Necessity and Propriety of Congress being the sole Legislators, in commercial Matters, for all and every of the States, and also to show, that the commercial Laws and Regulations of all the States of the Union, ought to be the same
<PB N="9" REF="020600_0009_0FB05153B3AC8400"/>
throughout, for that otherwise it will always be in the Power of individual States to take Advan∣tage of, and sharp upon other States, as much as if they were disunited States.</P>
<P><HI>Sharping</HI> being here mentioned, it may not be impertinent to touch upon a Practice had in some States, of decrying and depreciating, and refusing to take the Paper Money of other States, in Pay∣ments, unless a certain Discount is allowed by the Tenderer of such Paper Money to the Ten∣deree or Person who is to receive the same. Of this Kind of Traffic there have lately been glaring Instances, in Regard to the Paper Money of the State of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> which the Dealers in New-York, and even New-Jersey-Men themselves, refused, and still do refuse, to take, except upon a Discount of at least one Penny in every Shilling; and by artful Management, this Practice has been extended so as to introduce a Variety of Tricks and Frauds into different Dealings and Transactions. From such Practice it must be obvious that art∣ful Dealers have it in their Power to decry and depreciate the Paper Money of any State, and thereby to <HI>Sharp</HI> upon innocent and plain Persons at every Turn, and on all Occasions of their Dealing. One Way to prevent such Practice for the future might be, for Congress, by an Act, to declare that all Paper Money, or Bills for Money on Credit, emitted by any individual State, in Time coming, shall be aided, countenanced, and supported by the Credit of the United States▪ and where any individual State shall ultimately be∣come
<PB N="10" REF="020600_0010_0FB05156D97FCD30"/>
deficient in Credit, or in the satisfying of Demands upon them, on Account of their Paper Money, that such Deficiency shall ultimately be made a Charge against the United States, which they shall be answerable to pay, and the deficient State shall be bound to relieve and indemnify the United States, of and from all Deficiency, in the best and most expeditious Manner that such defi∣cient State can relieve and indemnify the United States.—Another Way to discourage, if not to prevent the abovementioned Practice, might be by an Act to be passed by Congress, making it a public Offence and Misdemeanor, in and for any Person or Persons to decry or depreciate, or pre∣vent the Currency of the Paper Money of any individual State, or to take any Discount on any Paper Money of any individual State, and making it lawful for any Person or Persons inhabiting in any of the United States, to summon the Of∣fender and Offenders in the Premises, to appear before any one or two or more Justices acting in the State where the Offender resides; and upon Proof being made of the Offence, by the Oath of one or more credible Witnesses, the Justice or Justices taking Cognizance of the Offence, to fine the Offender in any Sum not exceeding Twelve Pounds Currency, to be paid to the Person or Persons complaining, besides his or their reasona∣ble Charges and Costs in that Behalf sustained. And upon the Offender neglecting or refusing to pay such Fine and Costs, making it lawful for such Justice and Justices to commit the Offender to the next Gaol, there to continue imprisoned till he pays the Fine and Costs.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="020600_0011_0FB051599807A838"/>So much concerning a Practice not provided against by the Articles of Confederation, may be deemed a Digression; but now to return to the Observations on the penning of the American Articles.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It appears to be stipulated, that in deter∣mining Questions in the United States in Con∣gress assembled, each State shall have one Vote, (as in Article 5th) But this appears to be wrong; for that a State twice as large and twice as popu∣lous as another State, ought to have two Votes, when the lesser State has only one Vote, and the least or smallest State must certainly have one Vote; but the larger, more extensive, more considerable, and more respectable States, ought to have more than one Vote, ought to have two, or three, or four, or more Votes, in Proportion to the Diffe∣rence between a considerable or large State, and a smaller State. To maintain otherwise, is to dis∣regard an equal and fair Representation of the States by their Delegates in Congress assembled. But if more than one Vote is to be allowed to some States, still it will not be necessary to cause those States to send a Delegate for each Vote they may become intitled to; for that if they have but one Delegate attending in Congress, such one Delegate may vote as many Times as his Consti∣tuents are intitled to vote on any Question.</P>
<P N="5">V. Where it is provided, that no Treaty of Commerce shall be made, whereby the legislative Power of the respective States shall be restrained from imposing such Imposts and Duties on Fo∣reigners,
<PB N="12" REF="020600_0012_0FB0515B20DBD1C8"/>
as their own People are subjected to, or from prohibiting the Exportation or Importation of any Species of Goods or Commodities whatso∣ever (as in Article 9th.) It appears to be most improperly expressed and penned; for that no Treaty of Commerce ought to be made, or per∣mitted to be made or entered into, by any Power, other than the Congress, and no individual State ought to possess a legislative Power of imposing Duties on Foreigners, or of prohibiting the Ex∣portation or Importation of any Goods or Com∣modities, all which ought to be left to Congress, as possessing the sovereign and united legislative Powers of all the individual States; and under this Head of Observations, what has been men∣tioned above, in the 3d Head of Observations, will forcibly apply.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the United States in Congress as∣sembled, should be the last Resort, on Appeal, in all Cases (as in the said Article 9th) appears to be right and proper; but then there is no Provision made for enforcing the Decisions or Determinati∣ons of Congress, or for carrying them into Exe∣cution or Effect; and such Provision may have been designedly omitted, by the Opinion of some Person or Persons concerned in the penning of the Articles, who might consider such a Provision unnecessary, because it is a Principle or Rule in Law, that where a Jurisdiction is given to any Person, or a Body of Persons, to determine Mat∣ters in Controversy or Dispute between Parties, it follows by Consequence, that the Person, or
<PB N="13" REF="020600_0013_0FB0515DECB15C48"/>
Body of Persons intitled to the Jurisdiction, must have an inherent Right to render their Jurisdic∣tion effectual, and to have their Decisions and Determinations enforced and carried into due Execution, by all the Ways and Means in Law, usual or practicable for enforcing the Decisions and Determinations of any Jurisdiction whatever. But as this Principle, or Rule of Law, is recon∣dite, and not obvious to every Person, or any Persons not learned in the Law, it would be better to have an express Provision for enabling Congress to enforce their Decisions, and carry them into Execution. For this Purpose a Law may be passed by Congress, enacting, that in all Cases of Decisions or Determinations made by Congress, upon Matters of Controversy or Dispute between one individual State and another State, or more individual States, the State or States refusing or declining to obey and conform to such Decisions and Determinations, or to acquiesce therein, shall be deemed guilty of the highest Contempt against the sovereign Authority of Congress, and making it lawful for Congress to punish any refractory State or States, by and with such high Penalties, Fines, or Amerciaments, for their Contempt, as such their Contempt may appear to Congress to deserve: And also making it lawful to and for any Person or Persons, to be appointed by Con∣gress for that Purpose, to attach any two or more of the most reputable and most responsible Inha∣bitants of and in such refractory and disobedient State or States, and the Persons so attached to be
<PB N="14" REF="020600_0014_0FB0515EDC71C0E8"/>
answerable for the Whole of the State or States they belong to, and liable to pay such Fines, Penalties, and Amerciaments, as shall, by Con∣gress, be imposed on the delinquent State or States; but the Person and Persons so answering and paying for the delinquent State or States, to be reimbursed and indemnified by the respective State or States, according to the Rules and Usage of Law, in Cases where a certain small Number of Persons in a State, County, Parish, or other District <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attached to answer for the Whole.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Where it is declared, that the United States in Congress assembled, shall never engage in a War, &amp;c. unless nine States assent to the same (as in Part of the said Article 9th). It appears wrong and absurd; for it is plain, that the sovereign, supreme, and absolute Power was properly intended to be lodged, and ought to be lodged with Congress; and their Resolves and Engagements, whether concerning a War, or any other public Matter, ought, in all Cases, to go by a Majority of the Votes or Voices of the de∣legated Members, present and acting at the Time, and in no Resolve or Engagement, ought the As∣sent of nine States to be considered as necessary or proper, but on the contrary unnecessary and improper; because, in many Cases, and on ma∣ny Occasions of Importance, it might happen, that Nine States, out of Thirteen, might not have their Delegates present in Congress, which might stop, impede, and even defeat, some very important Resolve, however necessary it might
<PB N="15" REF="020600_0015_0FB0516059359530"/>
be for the public Good to have it passed instant∣ly.</P>
<P>Here it may appear pertinent to mention one other Defect of the Articles of Union, which is, that Congress, in any Part of the Articles, is not vested with any Power or Controul over any of its own Members, and it has been said, that any Member, on the Principle of Law, that <HI>Inter Pares nulla Potestas,</HI> may leave Congress, when∣ever he pleases, without Leave from Congress, or the State he represents; and that there has been an Instance, of a late Question before Congress, being lost by the wilful Absence of a Member. If it has been so, it must be considered an egre∣gious Defect in the Articles of Union, for it is believed, that this has been the first Instance in the World, of a sovereign and supreme Juris∣diction, conferred on a Body of Men, and at the same Time leaving them without any Power or Authority over their own individual Members. In various Jurisdictions, in different Countries, it has frequently happened, that individual Mem∣bers, have been attached, fined, and even im∣prisoned for Absence, Neglect, and Contempt of Duty; and so it ought to be in Congress, and such Power ought to be assumed by Congress, as a Matter of Course, incident to, and inherent in their Jurisdiction; but if it is weakly con∣sidered, that Congress cannot exercise any Power or Authority over their own Members, without an express Law for that purpose; such Law may easily be passed by Congress, making it a high
<PB N="16" REF="020600_0016_0FB051625D4E51C0"/>
Misdemeanor, in and for any Member to depart, or absent himself from his duty in Congress, without the Leave of Congress, first had and ob∣tained, and to make those Members of Congress who counteract such Law, liable and subject to such Fines and Censures as to Congress, by the Majority of Votes, shall, in their Discretion, seem meet; and to such Law, no Concurrence of any individual State or States, can, in the Nature of the Thing, be at all necessary or pro∣per.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>A WELL WISHER</HI> to the United States of America, who came lately from London to New-York, surprised to find News-Papers filled with Censures on the Lame∣ness of the Articles of the American Union, was thereby induced to consider those Articles and Censures with some Care, and thereupon, volunteeringly, to write his Observations, as above, which he hopes will give some Satisfaction to those who will peruse them.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
