<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LENGTH of time, change of countries and governments, corruption of language, and hasty copies in writing, before the more exact method of printing became generally used, has been the means of not only introducing, without design, into the Hebrew Bible, an insertion of some new words, but likewise an expulsion of some of the old, which produces a disagreement in some few parts, and makes it differ now from what it originally was in the times of David, Solomon, and at the commencement of the Babylonian cap∣tivity: some parts of the English translation are consequently erroneous; but they are so immate∣rial as not to affect, in the least, the truth of its sacred <HI>Records,</HI> or the tendency of its divine in∣struction. The few parts of the English transla∣tion, which I am instructed to alter in my wri∣tings, the propriety will be allowed by every person that has discernment to perceive, or con∣viction to believe:—beyond the limits of my au∣thority, for it is prescribed, I am not suffered to proceed in any word or in any way whatever.</P>
<P>The following are the words which the Lord God spoke to me in a vision, soon after I was
<PB N="4" REF="028359_0003_0FD8C521CCECCAC8"/>
commanded to write and make known his judg∣ments, for the good of London and general bene∣fit of all nations:—There is no other man under the whole heaven that I discover the errors of the Bible to, and reveal a knowledge how to correct them, so that they may be restored as they were in the beginning, but yourself.</P>
<P>Moreover, when I began to write I believed it necessary to adopt the same language as the Scripture does, regularly imitating it in the words—ye, thee, and thou; but God spoke to me in a vision of the night, and said—Write in the same manner as I always speak to you; write as other men do; write according to the custom of the country you live in; you will then be bet∣ter attended to, and what you write will be more easily understood.</P>
<P>A man that has been an officer in the navy, whose immediate ancestors have been separated from the Jews such a considerable length of time as to make them forget they ever belonged to the name, such a man declaring himself openly to the world a Prophet of God, the revealed Prince allotted to order the sudden return of the He∣brews from all nations, and govern them in the land of Israel, will, with some reason, I allow, excite both astonishment and doubt; but from the multiplied recorded testiomonies I produce, which no other on earth can, it ought not to prevail with any person as a just objection against believing what I write.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028359_0004_0FD8C56814674828"/>For observe, some hostile profession was ne∣cessary for me to be engaged in, to fulfil the re∣corded judgment on the family I am designed to represent in the seat of government; therefore, with all the certain proofs I have and will con∣stantly bring forward, with all the just reasons I advance, the surprise and doubt, entertained at the beginning, ought to vanish in as little time as would be requisite to read again the book which contains the account.</P>
<P>But remember likewise, from the records of Scripture, that Moses was taken away in his in∣fancy, and remained separated from his brethren for eighty years: the first forty of which he was reared in the palace of the king of Egypt, and educated in the language and customs of the country like one of its own native princes; yet he was revealed to the Israelites as the prophet of God, to order their hasty departure from Pha∣raoh's bondage, and afterwards to conduct them to the promised land.</P>
<P>Saul, the son of Kish, after being anointed king, prophesied in company with other men, to the great astonishment of all that saw him.</P>
<P>David, king of Israel, the greatest favourite that ever God had on earth, whose wars, though many, originated at that time from necessity and justice, never undertook, but to prevent the in∣troduction of idolatry, and preserve in the land of Israel a true uninterrupted worship of God,
<PB N="6" REF="028359_0005_0FD8C52302AE3010"/>
was a prophet; and for whose sake, in remem∣brance of his name, besieging armies were de∣stroyed, and Jerusalem safely delivered. Yet this great monarch, this unequalled favourite, this pattern of mercy to all kings, and who alone, of all men under heaven, possessed the establish∣ed promise of everlasting national government, could not, (but the objection did not proceed from any charge of injustice or sin,) for, being a man of war, and having shed much blood on the earth, although done by the express concurrence of the Most High, be permitted to build at Jeru∣salem a temple of worship for him: The great honour was given to Solomon, a king of peace, his son and immediate successor; so averse, though necessitated to order it, was the Creator of the world to the effusion of blood and the destructi∣on of man.</P>

<P>IN obedience to the sacred command of the Lord God, whose servant and prophet I am, I publish this writing, that it may be translated in∣to all languages, for the information and benefit of all nations.</P>
<P>This is the last sign, and last warning, I am commanded to say, that will be given in writing before I am <HI>revealed to the Jews,</HI> when the com∣mands delivered to me will be—to order them to depart in great haste from all nations, and go to the land of Israel: to repronounce the judgments of God, which have been suspended hitherto for my sake, and declare them irrevocable.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>PROPHECY</HI> which relates to the present time of the <HI>WORLD,</HI> the present <HI>WAR,</HI> and the approaching <HI>DISTRESS</HI> of all Nations.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD><HI>The Prophet Daniel,</HI> Chap. vii.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Baby∣lon, Daniel had a dream, and visions in the night on his bed; then he wrote the visions, to shew the substance of what they contained.</P>
<P N="2">2. Daniel spake and said; I saw in my vision by night, and behold the four winds of the hea∣ven strove on the great sea.</P>
<P N="3">3. And <HI>four great beasts</HI> came from the sea, different one from another.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="10" REF="028359_0009_0FD8C5278154D9D0"/>4. The first was like a lion, and it had ea∣gle's wings: I beheld until the wings were pluck∣ed, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</P>
<P>The lion means George the Third, the pre∣sent king of England; plucking the wings of the lion, means taking away the power of the king; made stand on the feet as a man, with a man's heart, means his reduction to the condition of other men, and possessing similar thoughts.</P>
<P>It is more than twenty months since I first wrote to the king, queen, and minister of state, to inform them of many things that would come to pass; that the time was nearly accomplished for some of the judgments of God to be made manifest, and also that this prophecy was fulfil∣ling: I beseeched them in the most earnest and respectful language, not to join in the war on any account whatever, or even encourage it; for the death of Louis the sixteenth would be im∣possible to prevent, it was recorded, and could not be avoided; the revolution in France, and its consequences, proceeded entirely from the judgment of God to fulfil this prophecy of Daniel: therefore all attempts to overthrow the judgment, and preserve the monarchy by force, was oppo∣sing what was determined in the Scripture of Truth should most certainly take place.</P>
<P>The aspect of the war was delusive, the en∣couragements of success that it held out to prin∣ces
<PB N="11" REF="028359_0010_0FD8C56F645715D8"/>
were deceitful; but those encouragements of delusion were permitted, to bring many nations under the judgment of God, and punish them for the heavy guilt of opposing his decrees.</P>
<P>If many had no more to sight against than a few men alone, or nations but one divided nation to subdue, then it might with reason be expected that the greatest number would soon overcome the least, and that many strong nations would soon conquer a weak one: but it is many men fight∣ing against the Spirit of God, and strong nations labouring in vain with their blood and treasure to overthrow his judgment.</P>
<P>The Lord God permits this opposition for three years and a half, to fulfil the determined part of this prophecy on all that oppose it; that done, his judgments will take place, to punish man and lay waste kingdoms.</P>
<P>St. John the Apostle, in the nineteenth chap∣ter of the Revelation, alludes to the present time of the world, and means the same things, though differently described, as the Prophet Daniel does in the seventh chapter; for which I am com∣manded to insert a part, that all princes and governments may be publicly warned, that they may know the consequences of this war, from the judgment of God, will be—death to millions, and everlasting distress to all nations.</P>
<P N="10">10. And I fell at his feet to worship him, and he said to me, see thou do it not; I am thy fellow
<PB N="12" REF="028359_0011_0FD8C52BC68E6010"/>
servant, and of thy brethren that have the testi∣mony of Jesus; worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P N="11">11. And I saw heaven opened; and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</P>
<P N="12">12. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself.</P>
<P N="13">13. And he was cloathed with a vesture dip∣ped in blood: and his name is called, The word of God.</P>
<P N="14">14. And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, cloathed in fine linen, white and clean.</P>
<P>The armies are an allusion to the powerful judg∣ments of God, under what—or how many differ∣ent forms their visitation of death is made on the world.</P>
<P N="15">15. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he will rule them with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Al∣mighty God.</P>
<P N="16">16 And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</P>
<P N="17">17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried with a loud voice, (meaning thunder, which is explained in the first book of Revealed
<PB N="13" REF="028359_0012_0FD8C570E6DB24C0"/>
Knowledge) saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, come and gather yourselves toge∣ther to the supper of the Great God.</P>
<P N="18">18. That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them; and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</P>
<P N="19">19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together, to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</P>
<P N="20">20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had receiv∣ed the mark of the beast, and them that wor∣shipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</P>
<P N="21">21. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword pro∣ceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> vii. <HI>continued.</HI> 5. And behold, another beast; a second, like a bear: and it raised itself up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth be∣tween its teeth; and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</P>
<P>This verse means the present Empress of Russia: She is according to the judgment of God in this prophecy, decreed to suffer death: and by
<PB N="14" REF="028359_0013_0FD8C52D07DD61C8"/>
revelation I am informed it will be done by the hands of man.</P>
<P N="6">6. After this, I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard: which had on its back four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it.</P>
<P>The leopard, means Louis the sixteenth king of France: the wings of a fowl on its back, is, like the eagle's on the lion, an allusion to the king's great moveable power.</P>
<P>The fall of this monarch from a throne, and afterwards suffering death, to fulfil the judgment of God by his prophet Daniel, was impossible for all the armies of Europe to prevent; equally so as the decreed death of Charles the first, king of England, which is mentioned by St. John in the thirteenth chapter and third verse of the Revela∣tion: <HI>the deadly wound being healed,</HI> in the same verse; means the <HI>recovery</HI> of monarchy <HI>by the re∣storation</HI> of Charles the second.</P>
<P N="7">7. After this I saw in the night visions a fourth beast; and behold, it was dreadful, and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped on the residue (meaning the electors) with its feet; it was different from all the beasts that were seen before, and it had ten horns.</P>
<P>This great beast, so different from the others, means the present Emperor of Germany; the ten horns, mean the electors, or princes of the em∣pire.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028359_0014_0FD8C57694C86B58"/>In one part of this chapter the horns are deno∣minated kings; the reason is, they raise armies, go to war, and govern with absolute power, like them; but notwithstanding, they all acknowledge the Emperor as their chief, and under that ac∣knowledgment of subjection are solemnly en∣gaged to defend his empire when called on. For which, to conceal the meaning of the prophe∣sy, until the fulness of time comes and the appoint∣ed person for it to be revealed to, the vision repre∣sents the German princes as horns of defence be∣longing to the Emperor's head.</P>
<P>It devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped on the residue with its feet—means the entire de∣struction of the German electors; and the pos∣session of their territories by the Emperor: he will destroy them, and also spread his dominion over Italy; threatening at the same time all Europe, and despising its kings with their feeble efforts to oppose him. Rome will fall under his power, and so will Venice likewise; the former will be retaken by the French republic, but the latter will be plundered and almost destroyed. After this, to fulfil the prophecy and the judgment of God, he will suffer death from the hands of man.</P>
<P>The orders of the Emperor, in the Netherlands are, that if the Austrian army should be defeated, <HI>and it most surely will,</HI> for I am commanded to re∣peat, as an example and warning, what the pro∣phet
<PB N="16" REF="028359_0015_0FD8C531BA800748"/>
Jeremiah was commanded to say to the messengers of Zedekiah, king of Judah.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xxxvii. 9. Thus says the Lord; Deceive not yourselves, saying, the Chaldeans will surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</P>
<P N="10">10. For though he had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men, yet they should rise up, every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</P>
<P>By the same example, if the French army was to be defeated, even again, and again it should re∣cover and conquer likewise; (that all the judg∣ments of God, in the seventh chapter of the pro∣phecy of Daniel, may take their course, and be ful∣filled,) to acknowledge the French republic, and make an immediate peace on the best terms that can be obtained, the interests of other nations will not be much consulted: time, the threats of a victorious enemy, and the perilous condition of the German army, will not admit the least delay.</P>
<P>The English will sharply remonstrate against this conduct; for which their army, however in∣credible it may appear to the Government now, will be surrounded, disarmed, and commanded to depart: but their General will be detained by the Austrian; and by revelation from the Lord God to me, he falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The Emperor being exhausted of money by the war, but having a large army at his command,
<PB N="17" REF="028359_0016_0FD8C577A3F48378"/>
determines, now he has made peace with the French, and quarrelled with the English, to ex∣ecute the plan he has for some time conceived the hopes of being one day able to accomplish— his father and uncle, strange as it may appear, yet it is most certainly true, for I am informed, by re∣velation, conceived the same design, and believed the attempt easily practicable when the opportuni∣ty offered, which is—<HI>the reduction of all Germany, under the sole government of himself.</HI></P>
<P>He begins with seizing on the electorate of Hanover, and plundering it quite bare: after this success, his ambition for more extensive dominion will rise; it will now lead him boldly forward to subject and devour them all. For God, to ful∣fil his judgments, and this prophecy of Daniel, in chapter vii. will deliver him over, to be go∣verned by the secret, but powerful workings of an evil spirit; because his inclinations are bad: according to all that I informed the King and Queen of in May and June 1792; as he did Ahab, king of Israel, to accomplish his fall, and the en∣tire destruction of his family.</P>

<HEAD><HI>First of Kings,</HI> Chap. xxii.</HEAD>
<P N="4">4. And he said to Jehoshaphat, wilt thou go with me to the battle to Ramoth Gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am the
<PB N="18" REF="028359_0017_0FD8C5362676B1E8"/>
same as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</P>
<P N="5">5. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, from the word of the Lord to day.</P>
<P N="6">6. Then the king of Israel gathered the pro∣phets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle; or shall I forbear? and they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</P>
<P N="7">7. And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might enquire of him?</P>
<P N="8">8. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is one man yet, Micaiah, the son of Im∣lah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him, for he does not prophecy good of me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</P>
<P N="11">11. And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made horns of iron; and he said, Thus says the Lord, with these thou shalt push the Syrians, un∣til thou consume them.</P>
<P N="12">12. And all the prophets prophesied so, say∣ing, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper: for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.</P>
<P N="13">13. And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah, spake to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets are as one mouth, declar∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="028359_0018_0FD8C57990FD1B18"/>
good to the king: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good also.</P>
<P N="14">14. And Micaiah said, As the Lord lives, what the Lord says to me, that will I speak:</P>
<P N="17">17. And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills as sheep which have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, these have no master; let them return, every man to his house in peace.</P>
<P N="18">18. And the king of Israel said to Jehosha∣phat, Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecy no good for me, but evil?</P>
<P N="19">19. And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left</P>
<P N="20">20. And the Lord said, who will persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead; and one said in this manner, and another said in that manner.</P>
<P N="21">21. And there came forth a Spirit, and he stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him.</P>
<P N="22">22. And the Lord said to him, In what man∣ner? and he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and pre∣vail also: Go forth, and do so.</P>
<P N="23">23. Now, therefore, behold, the Lord God has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy
<PB N="20" REF="028359_0019_0FD8C53755BF7588"/>
prophets, and the Lord has spoken of evil con∣cerning thee.</P>
<P>The Emperor's council will be filled with the same delusive evil spirit, that they may concur with him, and possess the same violent inclinati∣on for war and human destruction as himself. At this time a fresh decree will be issued from Vienna, commanding all Germany, and all the people under his government, as he conquers them by fire and sword, to offer solemn prayers up to the Lord God, for the further success of his imperial majesty's arms, the entire destructi∣on of his enemies, and the preservation of him∣self; styling him, <HI>in blasphemy against God,</HI> then most gracious, just, and merciful sovereign Lord.</P>
<P>The other nations of Europe, afraid and trem∣bling, will as solemnly implore the same Lord God for peace and safety, against such a cruel ene∣my, forgetting, that it was but a little time before, they were praying in the same strain of blasphe∣my as himself—<HI>to destroy their enemies, and give success to their arms;</HI> to that very gracious a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compassionate God, who sealed the redemption of man with his own blood, and strictly com∣manded all nations, as his children and people, to live in peace and brotherly love.</P>
<P>Opposition is in vain; he goes through the principalities like a flood, and collects in his pro∣gress a mighty army. The course of the pro∣phecy
<PB N="21" REF="028359_0020_0FD8C57DED7659F8"/>
is, That he shall conquer and destroy all before him: therefore he certainly will; and take away the treasure of many wealthy cities like∣wise.</P>
<P>After this, to finish oppression, and fulfil the decreed judgment of God, the French republic will be raised against him; his army will be en∣tirely overthrown in Italy, and himself will be com∣pelled to seek shelter among the very people whose relations he destroyed, whose towns he plun∣dered and burnt but a little time before. This is Francis, the present reigning Emperor of Ger∣many, who is described, in chap. vii. ver. 7. of the prophecy of Daniel, as great, strong, and ter∣rible; stamping under his feet with contempt, and destroying all the princes round him. His ambition will encrease with his dominion, and his conquests will be so wonderful, for a short time, as to make all Europe tremble; his end is miserable; and as he treated others without mer∣cy, no mercy will be shewn to him. His death, by the hands of man is certain, because decreed; and his punishment everlasting, because recorded. To be related to him now, will be considered hereafter as a capital crime.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> vii. <HI>continued.</HI> 8. I considered the horns, and behold there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</P>

He is one of the imperial electors, and to fulfil exactly what the visions of God describe him to be, he confidently calls him∣self, in great words,—The preponderating mem∣ber of the Germanic body.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia will acknowledge the French republic, and also make peace with it: he will oppose the Emperor, and likewise follow his ex∣ample; by which his dominions, to fulfil the pro∣phecy, will be enlarged (comparatively for a mo∣ment only) by the addition of three electorates, when the Bear, (meaning Russia,) watching for the opportunity, <HI>will rise</HI> and devour Prussia at one side, while the Emperor destroys him at the other. His armies will be defeated, and his ca∣pitol set on fire by the Bear: his life will be taken away from the earth, and his monarchy, to fulfil the everlasting decrees of the Lord God, in the prophecy of Daniel, will be destroyed; never, never, to be restored any more.</P>
<P>Russia will assist the Emperor in the beginning to promote her favourite design of destroying the Turkish empire; she will also quarrel with the Poles, and devour great numbers of them; War∣saw will be set on fire, and the government en∣tirely changed.

At the capitol it stops; here are its decreed bounds; no farther it must go. Here the Russian general divides the spoils of many cities with his army, and the rich provinces of Turkey between his offi∣cers. Here he despises the oath of fidelity, and throws away the submission of a subject—pro∣claiming himself Emperor of Greece.</P>
<P>After this the Swedes will enter Russia, and de∣stroy with great fury; even the ships of war and capitol will not escape. The Russian empire will be convulsed in many parts by its general and go∣vernors, each rising up in his place, and claiming an authority to command the other: they will fight until great multitudes are destroyed, and the country made desolate. The imperial family will all be cut off, and no successor will for ever after arise; the government, at the same time, will be broke to pieces, and utterly dissolved; never, ne∣ver, to be restored any more.</P>
<P>The Spanish Monarchy will cease by this war, and the Stadholdership of Holland will be cut off close to the ground; according to the visions of God to me, in 1792, and which I communicated at that time by his sacred command to the king and queen of England.</P>

<P>The <HI>death of the French king,</HI> as one of the particular number mentioned in the seventh chap∣ter of Daniel, decreed to die, took place, to ful∣fil the pre-determined judgment of God by this prophet; the monarchy of France is likewise by the same judgment, abolished for ever, and the present form of government established.

It is for this that he is described by Daniel, to have a <HI>mouth speaking great things and blasphemies.</HI> All this would have been permitted, because record∣ed, to fulfil the prophecy; to hasten his own de∣struction,

both you and him in certain death? What I ac∣quainted you with in 1792, and often since, was made known to me by <HI>visions and revelations</HI> from the Lord God. The <HI>death of Louis</HI> XVI. and the removal of the English crown from the king's head, to a level with the ground, according to the seventh chapter of Daniel; the fall of the queen's palace, and the destruction of the tower; your own removal from administration, and af∣terwards death, was among the things which I informed you of, would most certainly come to pass as the evil consequences of this delusive war. My account to you then, of futurity, concluded with these words—"The visions are established, and the things mentioned most certain and true."</P>
<P>When I informed you that England would en∣ter into this war, and the consequences which would, in despite of all your efforts, flow from it, <HI>you despised me;</HI> for, at that time, the war was not intended; and to tell of evils that would most certainly ensue from a thing, when the thing they were to proceed from was not design∣ed, were to you the effects of folly and deceit.</P>
<P>My knowledge of future things is given me from God; therefore what I wrote was true: A little time longer, and England will be so much entangled as not to be able to go forward without feeling the pains of that <HI>colonial conquest</HI> which is to be the cause of her death; nor to retire, with∣out falling under that foreign blow, which will

the seventh chapter of the prophecy of Daniel, and some of the judgments of God in the Reve∣lation; that the death of Louis the XVI. and the revolution in France, for the perpetual de∣struction of its monarchy, was decreed in the Scripture of Truth; and would, against all hu∣man opposition, most surely take place: To in∣form them that the war, just going to be com∣menced by Prussia and Austria, against France, was the very war alluded to by St. John, in the Revelation, chap. xix. which God called a war against himself; because it went to oppose his decrees, and because it would be an effort of kings to overthrow his unalterable judgment. I was commanded to advise them, as I was the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>minister of state,</HI> not to join in the war, or even encourage it on any account whatever: To inform them of the approaching fall of mo∣narchy in Europe, the great distress this war would be productive of to all nations, but par∣ticularly to those that engaged in it: and like∣wise to inform them of their own sudden fall in the jaws of the earth by a pre-determined earth∣quake, according to the judgment of God, in chap. xvi. ver. 16, 17, 18 and 19, of the Reve∣lation; and, lastly, to entreat them to acknow∣ledge this gracious communication from God, for their length of life and blessing, by an obe∣dience to his good advice.</P>

The Lord God spoke to me in∣stantly, on being ordered to go about my business, and said—Get away, get away from this place; be under no concern, it was not you that was despised and ordered away, but me, in your person, that sent you.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home I was in a <HI>vision,</HI> and saw a large measuring rod move through the streets in great haste, and strike many of the houses as it passed, marking them for their ap∣proaching fall.

<P>The information, as will be plainly seen by the date, which I gave to the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>minister of state,</HI> with what I was commanded to offer to the parliament, was not only before the present war with France was entered into, but also some length of time before it was ever intended: there∣fore

no person can say, with justice, that either my conduct in obeying the positive commands of God, or my endeavours to preserve this country from the many evils it has now to encounter with according to the determined judgment of uner∣ring prophecy; originated from weak ideas or po∣litical motives. No, my knowledge is given from God; I see all things now as they truly are; and know their consequences, to change them to what they really will be hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>The Prophecy of Daniel, in the Seventh Chapter, continued.</HEAD>
<P N="9">9. I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit; whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</P>
<P>This verse alone, unassisted by any informa∣tion from me, is sufficient to explain the most ne∣cessary parts of the chapter to know; every per∣son that reads it must confess that it alludes to the latter time of the world, and that the general dissolution of human grandeur, which it men∣tions, is but the expected necessary preparation for the coming of Christ, to judge the world.</P>
<P N="10">10. A fiery stream issued, and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</P>
<P>The latter part of this verse corroborates the explanation that is given of the preceding one.</P>
<P N="11">11. I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke—<HI>is the king of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussia</HI>—(here the prophet Daniel returns to the former part of the vision, and gives a further ac∣count

of what was shewn him). I beheld, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</P>
<P>The death of this <HI>beast;</HI> means the death of the emperor of Germany, it is certain; and all the armies of Europe cannot save him, nor prevent the accomplishment of it by the hands of man. The judgment of God, according to this prophecy, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also, that he shall suffer the punishment of ever∣lasting fire.</P>
<P N="12">12. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</P>
<P N="13">13. I saw in the night visions, one like the Son of man; and behold, he came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and stood near before him.</P>
<P N="14">14. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</P>
<P N="15">15. I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions I saw trou∣bled me.</P>
<P N="16">16. I came near to one of them that stood by, <HI>(an angel,)</HI> and asked him the meaning of all these things; so he told me, and made me un∣derstand the interpretation of them.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="028359_0044_0FD8C59F33AA70C0"/>The prophet Daniel, in his visions, as well as St. John the Apostle in the Revelation, had al∣ways an attending angel near, to explain the meaning of every thing he saw that was necessary for him to be informed of.</P>
<P N="17">17. These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</P>
<P N="18">18. But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</P>
<P>The time is very nearly come for the <HI>judg∣ments of God to be felt in all nations,</HI> and this part of the prophecy to be fulfilled in Europe: It is a warning to all princes and states, to honour God, and fear his judgments; to live in peace, and go∣vern with mercy.</P>
<P N="19">19. Then I asked him the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, and exceeding dreadful! whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which de∣voured, broke in pieces, and stamped on the re∣sidue with its feet.</P>
<P N="20">20. And of the ten horns that were in its head, and of the other which came up, before whom three fell; even of that horn which had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</P>
<P>The beginning of this verse means the Ger∣man Princes; the rest of it the king of Prussia; he threatens and executs more, presuming on the
<PB N="46" REF="028359_0045_0FD8C560EDEF4700"/>
unconquerable power of his army, than any of his equals. His being represented in the visi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God as a horn, with eyes, and a mouth speak∣ing very great things, is an illusion to his milita∣ry strength, quick discernment, and violent incar∣nation to quarrel; always disputing for territory pushing at or fighting against some nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other.</P>
<P N="21">21. I beheld, and the same horn made war on the saints, and prevailed against them.</P>
<P>For my entreaty the Lord God has been pleas∣ed to suspend this part of the prophecy, the latter part of the twenty-first verse, that of allowing the king of Prussia to prevail against the righteous, and govern them with great oppression, under the power of his army, for three years and a half.</P>
<P N="22">22. Until the Ancient of Days came, when judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints should possess the kingdom.</P>
<P N="23">23. Thus he said; The fourth beast will be the fourth kingdom on earth. (The emperor will reduce, under his subjection, all Germany, the neighbouring states, and all Italy, to form this great kingdom,) which will be different from all the other kingdoms; (meaning the other great kingdoms or monarchies, shewn in the vision; which are, England, Russia, and France). It will try to devour the whole earth, tread it down, and break it in pieces.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="47" REF="028359_0046_0FD8C5A035D21380"/>24. And the ten horns, out of his kingdom, (meaning the German electors, before they are destroyed by the Emperor,) are ten kings which will arise; and another will arise after them, (meaning the king of Prussia, who is an elector); he will be different from the first, and will subdue three kings.</P>
<P>When the king of Prussia opposes the Emperor, he will also at that time follow his example, which will soon now begin to manifest itself; indeed, the interval of time between this and then is but short; for all things are hastening fast, and con∣curring in their operations, to extend the war, and give the prophecy its full recorded course.</P>
<P N="25">25. And he will speak great words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High; and will think to change times and laws: and they will be given into his hand, for a time, and times, and the dividing of time.</P>
<P>The beginning of this verse means the king of Prussia, speaking in <HI>blasphemy</HI> against God, threat∣ening in great words, as if he posseded the whole power of heaven, to conquer and destroy, with his army, all cities that do not open to him, and all men that oppose his designs. This was exact∣ly fulfilled by the Horn, when he entered France in 1792; the proclamations which he issued, at that time, are full of <HI>blasphemy</HI> against God, pre∣sumption for his great army, and violent threats to destroy cities, and cut innocent men to pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="028359_0047_0FD8C561E4DAF790"/>Change times and laws: the meaning of which is, that what God decrees is his law, and this prophecy contains it; an opposition by the <HI>king of Prussia</HI> to what God has decreed shall come to pass, is endeavouring by force of arms to sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the course of the prophecy, and change the de∣creed time for it to be fulfilled. The king of Prussia, by threatening, with the great strength of his army, to build up, what God, to fulfil this prophecy, has thrown down; to restore that mo∣narchy in France, which God, to fulfil his re∣corded judgment in this prophecy, has removed forever;—is the meaning of—<HI>And he will think to change times and laws.</HI></P>
<P>And they will be given into his hand, for a time and times, and the dividing of time. The meaning of which is that the king of Prussia, al∣though acting in opposition to the will of God, (for every man that reads the Scripture, and be∣lieves it to be the book of truth, possessess from that moment a knowledge of good and evil, of right and wrong, of what is merciful, and what is cruel, of what is pleasing to God, and what is offensive,) is permitted to wage a war of injustice against the righteous for three years and a half; during which time, according to the prophecy, he would conquer and destroy great multitudes of them. But my prayers prevailed with God, even against his own recorded judgment by Da∣niel, for I beseeched him to oppose the unjust
<PB N="49" REF="028359_0048_0FD8C5A4B20BA540"/>
designs of the king of Prussia, before he invaded France; after he had, to suspend the prophecy, and for my sake to turn him back The Lord God spoke to me in a vision, at night, and said. "He shall go out of France with shame and confusion."</P>
<P>This promise was fulfilled in the year 1792; for, soon after the Prussian army entered France, God led it into such difficult places as to endanger safety; he also sent the visitation of a wasting sick∣ness, that forced it to go away, ashamed and high∣ly disappointed. Although the other parts of the prophecy must necessarily be fulfilled to accom∣plish the purposes of God, and the destruction of the Prussian monarchy, the king cannot conquer as the judgement intended, but he is permitted to oppose, sometimes defeated with shame, and sometimes encouraged by deceitful success; until his armies become weak, and the Bear becomes strong; until the proper time arrives for him like∣wise to fall.</P>
<P N="26">26. But the judgment shall sit, (it ought to be, <HI>But the judgment shall take place,</HI>) and they shall take away his dominion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o consume and de∣stroy it to the end.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia will have his country de∣stroyed by <HI>fire and sword;</HI> his power will be ta∣ken away, and also his life; the government will be changed, and the monarchy will be abo∣lished for ever.</P>
<P>In the year 1792 I sent the commands of God,
<PB N="50" REF="028359_0049_0FD8C5A7A7E666B8"/>
as they were given to me by revelation at night, to the king of England, for the king of Prussia, before he invaded France, desiring him to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> home, and have nothing to do with the people of that country; for the change of government taking place among them was determined; that the unalterable judgment of God, in the Scrip∣ture of Truth, might be fulfilled: reminding him, at the same time, as a corroborating testimony, that which I wrote was from God, of the moni∣tor that entered his breast, and so powerfully struggled with his inclination to keep him back from war, that when he positively resolved on it, reproached him strongly with the injustice.</P>
<P>That intelligent, internal monitor, was in truth no other than the compassionate spirit of the liv∣ing God, striving, to the last moment, to save a falling man from the dreadful effects of his own judgment: but the king of Prussia despised the blessed intimation, and resolved on a war; that if there was no knowledge of God in the world, no part of human reason could find the least coloura∣ble pretence to justify.</P>
<P>At the time of my writing to the king of Eng∣land, relative to the king of Prussia, I informed him, as I was commanded, of the certain failure of the combined armies of Prussia and Austria.</P>
<P>And the kingdom, and dominion, and the great∣ness, (meaning the power of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven,) will be given to the
<PB N="51" REF="028359_0050_0FD8C5A7AA1C5D70"/>
people and saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions must serve and obey him.</P>
<P>This is that real kingdom of heaven, of Chri∣stianity in practice, to believe and obey God, which was commanded by Christ, to preserve the seal of man, and a due knowledge of himself; preached by the apostles, and through them the foundation of it laid in all nations; though deter∣mined from the first transgression of Adam, and began more than seventeen hundred years ago, with all the materials ready prepared, from the multiplied interruptions of war and other causes, incident to human kingdoms, like the second temple at Jerusalem—long in building—This mighty structure is not finished yet. This is that stone, cut out without hands, mentioned by the prophet Daniel, in his second chapter, 34th and 35th verses which breaks the head and the feet, the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, and the clay, of the great image of human power to pieces: and this is that kingdom, mentioned by the same prophet, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4th verse following, which is to break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms; but which is to remain itself forever. The name of this universal kingdom is Peace; it has the bles∣sed Gospel for its government, and the Lord God for its king.</P>
<P>As I knew in the beginning of 1792, that the king of England would enter into this war, and
<PB N="52" REF="028359_0051_0FD8C5ABA1311200"/>
by doing so fall under the same judgment from God as the other monarchs shewn in the vision unless I could, by a just explanation of the pro∣phecies, persuade him to remain at peace; he will I trust, with the queen and minister of sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, do me the justice hereafter to acknowledge, that the danger was fully communicated; and that I did not cease in my endeavours to prevent him from joining in the confederacy against France, not only for a long time before he intended it, but also after he had, even till the designs of govern∣ment were ready to be executed by open prepa∣rations for hostility.</P>
<P>If this war was like any that has preceded it, a prince might, as usual, sit down at his leisure, and calculate, from his successes, how long to carry it on; or, by his defeats, how soon he must leave it off: but the death of Louis XVI. and the revo∣lution in France, having proceeded from the re∣corded judgment of God, the two <HI>things which have occasioned it, and which have rendered it so en∣tirely different, that its consequences are already deter∣mined,</HI> will be the same to the monarchs engaged in it, as it happens to a man unexpectedly caught in a large trap, on forbidden ground—the pains of death convince him of transgression before his eyes could warn him of the danger.</P>
<P>I know the judgments of God; by them I am directed; by revelation and through his holy Spirit I write. To fulfil, then, the seventh chap∣ter
<PB N="53" REF="028359_0052_0FD8C5ACEFC96218"/>
of Daniel, and such parts of the revelation as mean the present time and the same thin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the war now carrying on will involve all the nations engaged in it in great distress, and nearly all the princes of Europe in death. As I knew all this a considerable time before the war, I set my heart and my mind to intercede with God, al∣though it was against his recorded judgment to save the king, and <HI>spare the country.</HI> I live in: I succeeded with God, and obtained an offer of mercy; but could not with man, to believe and accept it.</P>
<P>I wish well to the king and queen, and like∣wise their family; to know all that I have re∣lated, and more than I am permitted to tell; to know the unavoidable death of him, and after∣wards the certain destruction of an amiable wo∣man and her children, would, I thought, be a crime to reproach for ever the feelings of my heart, if I did not implore, when I knew the great kindness that God had for me, and endea∣vour, by all the means in my power, to prevent it.</P>
<P>But in doing this I have subjected myself to the power of human laws, when, indeed, I had the choice to make them subject to me; for if I had not become an intercessor, by prayer and supplication for the people I live among, I should have been sent away from London. Its fall would soon after take place; and then my reve∣lation, as the next great thing to warn the world,
<PB N="54" REF="028359_0053_0FD8C5B040581AB0"/>
would immediately succeed; but, preferring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> safety to my own immediate advanta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>although informed at the time that the people would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lieve that I should he despised, and made suffer▪</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obtained its pardon at the risk of my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and determined to remain in it until my time to he revealed was entirely completed.</P>
<P>I find, yes, I feel by dreadful experience, that all men are insensible to the consequences <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f those judgments, recorded in the Scripture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are also exceedingly hardened against believing their true interpretation and time to be fulfilled. That I have suffered, by imprisonment and dis∣tress, more than is proper now to publish <HI>fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣treating, when I was told that my entreaties were contrary to the prophecies,</HI> to save the king and his family; London and its inhabitants, from record∣ed destruction; God, who is more generous to give mercy than man is grateful to believe and ac∣cept it, is by all this revealed knowledge of his prophecies my witness now, and will, in due time, in a short time, be additionally so, by terrible signs and mighty wonders.</P>
<P>I have said, in the first book, that the fulfil∣ling of the judgments of God, however destruc∣tive they might prove to the nations or govern∣ments, which they are directed against, would not affect any personal safety, nor operate in the least to my prejudice: my elevation is recorded in the Scripture, and established by promise to
<PB N="55" REF="028359_0054_0FD8C5B0429A0BD0"/>
myself; besides, I am not mortal to human pow∣er. But although I am to be great, <HI>for above any prince on earth,</HI> and cannot be destroyed by man: although the fall of governments and ruin of na∣tions, will not be allowed to affect my personal safety, nor operate in the least to my prejudice, I will not provoke any, but endeavour, by a peace∣able conduct, civility, and fair words, to make all men believe.</P>
<P>My earnest desire and prayer to God is, that as he has given me a pre-eminence of favour to all men, that were ever upon earth before, I may be able, <HI>although I have been in prison, insulted and despised; although my zeal is broke, and thy in∣clination altered,</HI> to save in this country one per∣son as well as another; the king, as well as my∣self; the rich, as well as the poor; all without distinction. For which I request all men to me∣ditate on the present times, and consult with themselves by their knowledge of the Scripture, by comparing the leading features of what turned other great nations unexpectedly, to what are now as suddenly opening to human view, and what are as unexpectedly coming to pass in the world; of the judgments and prophecies to be fulfilled, which every man that has the spirit of conviction to believe, and an understanding to discern, must plainly perceive that the convulsed state of Europe, as it now presents itself, is one of their visible features; and that the sudden

<HEAD><HI>Of the Revelation,</HI> Chap. v.</HEAD>
<P>The book means the prophecies intended to be concealed until this time of the world, which is the time they relate to: its seals, their spirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> lock or fastening.</P>
<P>Observe, the revelation was given to St. John a long time after the death of Christ, not to com∣memorate those things which were before, which were fulfilled, and which were known before the time of writing it; but to record those things which are to be in future and which are to be ful∣filled; according to the words of God, declared in the fourth chapter, and first verse, which are "Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be <HI>hereafter.</HI>" They were shewn to him in heaven, under such wonderful, such in∣comprehensible similitudes, in visions, as to seal their meaning a perfect secret, until the time of the world alluded to came, when the designed spirutual person (for no man can be a prophet o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ, now under Christianity, and speaking through the Holy Ghost, his spirit, without bear∣ing some similarity to himself in meekness and compassion; witness the apostles) would be re∣vealed, to open the spiritual seals, and make knowe the secret prophecies under them in the book.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> vi. The four first seals are opened, and the covering of secrecy is removed; the judgments
<PB N="65" REF="028359_0064_0FD8C5CDEB3591B8"/>
which are to punish the world for transgression, by raising nation against nation, and man against man, are gone forth, <HI>spiritually under the simili∣tudes expressed in this chapter, to the eighth verse,</HI> and are begun to be fulfilled: the concealed meaning of the prophecies, which have been carefully preserved so for me until the present time, are now declared; the spiritual seals are opened the contents of the spiritual book, which they shut, is known, and a revealed knowledge of it published in this <HI>visible book,</HI> for the good of all mankind.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to acknowledge the kindness of a poor woman, that brought me a three-penny loaf each week, every Monday morning, when I was in prison Her name is Isabella Wake. The prison is Newgate.</P>
<P>A man that died the day before, of a bad fever, and from neglect, for the want of proper nourish∣ment, as I was told, made a vacancy in a room, with fourteen poor men, little air, and much crouded, for me to come into his place.</P>
<P>The small, very small pennyworth of bread, with water only, except one day in the week, when there are a few ounces of beef, for twen∣ty-four hours, is barely sufficient to keep life and body together. The prison is very close; there is not room enough to promote health, by the ne∣cessary exercise of walking: there are no coals al∣lowed
<PB N="66" REF="028359_0065_0FD8C5CF22B93C88"/>
for fire, nor candles for light. There is no bed to lie on, nor blanket to cover one; The poor are entirely destitute here.</P>
<P>When the condition of prisons, and the treat∣ment of prisoners, is required for public informa∣tion, it is from the poor man, whose health is in∣jured by confinement, who has to draw his little air through a small iron-barred window, who has but a small pennyworth of bread allowed for the whole day to live on, that a true account is to be received; but certainly not from the officers, keepers, and contractors, who live in plenty, whose emoluments swell in proportion as the pri∣sons grow crouded.</P>
<P>Therefore be no longer astonished that Lon∣don, in one part of the Revelation is called un∣der the name of the great city, <HI>for she is the great∣est city in Europe, and the richest in the world;</HI> in another part she is called Sodom; and in a third, she is, as well as Rome, <HI>spiritually called</HI> Babylon the Great.</P>
<P>No man, who has any knowledge of God, can justly say, that London is without guilt, and her people are without sin; when her streets are full of vice, and her prisons are full of oppression.</P>

<P>Moreover, I will provide for you; and although I am now poor, without house or servant, I shall soon have abundance, and be at the head of the greatest nation on earth: In my palace you shall always have an apartment, and at my table you shall always have a seat.</P>
<P>I am commanded to acknowledge likewise the acts of friendship I received from captain Han∣chett, of Abingdon-street, which the Lord God considers as shewn directly to himself; therefore his blessing is on you; and by his promise in the Gospel, your reward is great. Moreover I am commanded to inform you, as well for the benefit of your children hereafter, as yourself immedi∣ately, that although you name is Hanchett, there is John Pitt Earl of Chatham, Sir Gilbert Elliot, and Charles Grey: you, as well as them, the

<P>All this has been told me by revelation, from the Lord God, in visions of the night.</P>
<P>There are many of my family, which have heard of me, and with which the Spirit of God has given me favour, that do not want either in∣clination or ability to demonstrate their friendship; but they are deterred, from a fear of offending government, and from a fear of incurring the im∣putation of guilt, by being generous.</P>
<P>The pre-ordained and designed signet of peace for all nations, cannot do any thing that will ulti∣mately tend to injure any prince, government, or individual: if they view his words in a contrary light, it is because they calculate the future by the past; they know the things which were last month, but have no knowledge of those things which are to be the next. For all he does by writing, is to preserve the weak alive, and save the strong from falling down.</P>
<P>The weapons of his writing are not weak and carnal, but mighty and spiritual: when he is or∣dered to re-pronounce the judgments of God, and withdraw his eye from pity, the great power of his words will be felt to destroy, before their effects are seen to admonish; then, fleets, ar∣mies, princes, governments, and nations, must implore the God of heaven for mercy, and re∣ceive

<P N="5">5. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</P>
<P N="6">6. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to their children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</P>
<P>The Elijah, mentioned in this chapter, and the messenger, mentioned in the first verse of the third chapter, mean two distinct persons. The one was the immediate messenger of Christ, when he came for the salvation of mankind; the other, his recorded prophet, to pronounce his judgments, and warn the world, before he comes to destroy it.</P>
<P>This is that great prophet, alluded to in the chapter, under the name of Elijah, and not St. John the Baptist: he will possess the Spirit of God equal to Elijah, and have the power of his fire in the same manner. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers; that is, he will sup∣press <HI>war and violence,</HI> which sets the old against the young and the young against the old. He
<PB N="70" REF="028359_0069_0FD8C5D9EA0E1530"/>
will command peace, and by the great power given him from heaven, enforce an obedience wherever he comes.</P>
<P>The appointment of this prophet, being to in∣vite first, and compel after, all nations to come into the kingdom of peace, as a necessary prepa∣ration to meet Christ, when he comes to visit and judge the world: St. John the Baptist, for being appointed to prepare for Christ, preaching the same kingdom of peace, and promising, by bap∣tism, mercy to all that would believe, is the real and very reason, that Christ, in the seventeenth chapter of St. Matthew, calls him Elias.</P>
<P>At a former time, when I was entreating God to spare London, I mentioned no man by his ti∣tle: but when I was writing an account of it for public information, he said to me, "unless you write their titles, they themselves wont know who you mean." It will appear strange, because I am not acquainted with any of the distinguished persons alluded to; but I knew every one by some particular act that caught my approbation, and made me remember them then. It seemed as if God had done this on purpose, for he has often said to me since, in visions and revelations at night, You must be a wall of defence and safe∣ty to many a great man;—yes, even to some that despise you now. At that time, after men∣tioning
<PB N="71" REF="028359_0070_0FD8C5E0CBF7E378"/>
the name of William Pitt, I passed by that of his brother; immediately after, the Lord God reminded me of it, and, in a voice of great softness and good nature, said, There is <HI>John Pitt,</HI> won't you mention him? You don't know who he is <HI>I forgave.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of 1790 the Spirit of God begun first, (although I always had a presentiment of being sometime or other very great) to enlighten my understanding, and teach me to distinguish right from wrong. At that time I was an officer in the navy, and considering that voluntary swear∣ing, which I was obliged to comply with, every six months as a qualification to receive my pay, was unnecessary, unjust, and wicked, I request∣ed to be indulged with permission to receive it without; stating at the same time, the concealed and unheeded cruelty of the oath, with my own reasons for objecting to the form: when I was told, in answer to my request, that there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to dispense with it.</P>
<P>Soon after this I made another request, sup∣porting my objections to voluntary swearing, with observing, That if the <HI>order of council</HI> en∣forced an oath in any manner or under any form whatever, and that the man it was directed to operate on, swore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a voluntary act—<HI>the re∣sult
<PB N="72" REF="028359_0071_0FD8C5E549F66270"/>
of his own free will</HI>—would it not in the sight of God in heaven, and every <HI>man</HI> of discernment under him on earth, amount to a false oath?</P>
<P>These reasons with these objections, and the letter I received from the admiralty, stating their insufficient power to dispense with the usual form of swearing, I published at that time in the news∣paper called the <HI>Public Advertiser.</HI></P>
<P>During the time of my writing officially to the admiralty, I had occasion to write also to the president, whom I knew to be a member of the council; with the business of swearing which led me to make an application, I remarked to him; that as men, whether few in number, or the encreased multitude of a senate were not infalli∣ble, they must consequently be subject to error. To corroborate more forcibly this assertion, and likewise to impress a conviction of its justice, I mentioned among other things a decision of the privy counsel relative to a native of Glasgow, who had his ship seized in the West Indies for an <HI>undesigned</HI> infringement of the Navigation act.</P>
<P>After a legal investigation in that country, it was clearly proved and openly acknowledged, that although the apparent defect in the register might authorize the seizure, it could not justify a condemnation; because the commander, <HI>like an honest man,</HI> shewed it at the Custom-house, and received the approbation of the principal officer.</P>
<P>An appeal was lodged against this acquittal by
<PB N="73" REF="028359_0072_0FD8C5E8E4BE76B0"/>
the seizing officer in the West Indies, and brought before the privy council in England!—the ship was condemned.</P>
<P>To constitute a high court of equity, its mem∣bers, to pronounce their judgment agreeable to that very name their existence as a court is de∣rived from, must be governed more by the <HI>inten∣tion</HI> than the presumptive proof. But to consti∣tute a court of law, its judges must be directed by the express letter of the act of parliament un∣der which they officiate.</P>
<P>For example, two men go into a forest; while the one is fetching a blow to cut down a tree, the axe flies from the handle and kills the other: Here is a presumptive proof of murder, and the law very justly brings the survivor to trial. But <HI>equity,</HI> viewing this circumstance in a proper light, declares the innocence, and acquits ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>Another, and more relevant to the seizure. A man buys a stamp, to legalise a bond for the bet∣ter security of trading with his money, <HI>or in plainer language, lending it on interest;</HI> to be cer∣tain that this stamp is warrantably just, accord∣ing to the prescribed forms of law, he shews it at the stamp-office, where it is acknowledged to be good and safe: after this, in consequence of some defect, it is declared illegal, and the holder subjected to a penalty.</P>
<P>I believe every man on earth, that has the com∣mon
<PB N="74" REF="028359_0073_0FD8C5EA6ED71AA8"/>
faculty of distinguishing white from black, will agree with me in saying, that it would be repugnant to equity to fine the holder for a defe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that he had no knowledge of as such, and for what was authorized by the very office of go∣vernment that always issued the stamps.</P>
<P>The law supposes criminality from the appear∣ance; but equity measures it from the design. The one is external and visible, provided many years before it may be wanted: the one is inter∣nal and spiritual, always alive in the heart of every judge that possesses prudence, learning, and penetration.</P>
<P>When I was writing of these things to the Earl of Chatham, on my knees I made a solemn vow to the Almighty God, declaring that if he would be pleased to enable me, I would most surely procure an indemnification for the poor man that lost his ship. Since that time the Lord God has told me, by revelation at night, That he would most truly enable me: for if I liked, I should be President of the Council, and Chancellor of the Exchequer: I should have any thing that I re∣quired. Immediately after this, I heard another voice from heaven, say, The Lord have mercy on them, if they had not you for their friend and counsellor; for England is the Spiritual Egypt mentioned in the eleventh chapter of the Reve∣lation to St. John.</P>
<P>After making the numerous representations I
<PB N="75" REF="028359_0074_0FD8C5EF055130D8"/>
have mentioned, the Earl of Chatham, with great propriety, acknowledged their justice so far as to erase the word <HI>Voluntary</HI> from the prescrib∣ed form of swearing: but I was then reminded of the words of Christ in the 5th chapter, 34th verse of St. Matthew, and strictly commanded to obey them. Soon after this, I requested from the admiralty, and often repeated it, a dispensing order that I might receive my pay without an oath; but they would not grant it.</P>
<P>If the Earl of Chatham had shewn me the small favour I asked for, and certainly it would have been but a very small one to him, he should be held up to the world, as my friend, to be ad∣mired and regarded; he should wear such a du∣rable coronet as would make him the envy of princes; it should be a coronet that no human power would ever be able to remove.</P>
<P>As the admiralty would not give me that rea∣sonable indulgence I requested, as they would not shew me that kindness which, as men living by the navy, they might have done with ease, and without prejudice to their dignity; I wanted for a bit of bread to eat: I was besides treated so ill, as to be dragged to a work house without any legal authority, against every remonstrance I could make, and against every threat I could make use of to call them to a strict account for the injustice. The admiralty knew all this; they might have prevented it, by ordering what was
<PB N="76" REF="028359_0075_0FD8C5F1EC391738"/>
due to me to be paid; but they would neither prevent the evil, nor enable me to be liberated: they would not order the payment of what was due, until open falsehood was made use of to say I was out of my senses. It seemed as if they were under some private apprehension, though pleased with my distress, of being charged one day or other in the eyes of their country with unfeeling cruelty, and wanted some kind of co∣lourable evidence to justify the proceeding.</P>
<P>Hear, therefore, all nations, and be warned by it, what the Lord God has told me by reve∣lation, and now commands me to write, that the injuries I received, because done for obeying his word in the blessed, Gospel, the remem∣brance of them should never be blotted out from the throne of heaven. Moreover, he said, like∣wise, that he would shake the English admiralty as a man would violently bread in a basket, un∣til he loosed the foundations of the earth, and shook the place in pieces.</P>
<P>If I am out of my senses, in the opinion of the admiralty, for refusing, first to take an idle oath, secondly, a false one, and thirdly, to take any: Christ, the Saviour of the world, and him that Isaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Coun∣sellor, who prohibits by his Gospel in the strong∣est terms all kind of swearing, must, by the same rule of knowledge for giving such a com∣mand, be out of his.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="028359_0076_0FD8C5F1EE603528"/>As the Quakers never swear, and their ob∣jections to it are sanctioned by a just indulgence of law; they, the king and parliament, for giv∣ing the indulgence, must, for the same reason as I am, be out of theirs.</P>
<P>Christ having been abused at Jerusalem, re∣proached with having a devil, being mad, and out of his senses, makes it the less astonishing for me, that am his servant, to be reviled in the same manner: For which the Lord God com∣mands me to remind all men, from the testimo∣ny of his blessed Gospel, that the sin is blasphemy against his Holy Spirit, and that the punishment is everlasting fire.</P>
<P>It is from visions and revelations, and through the Holy Ghost, that I write this book for the benefit of all men: therefore, to say it is false, that I am mad, am an imposter, have a devil, or am out of my senses, constitutes the dangerous sin of blasphemy.</P>

<HEAD>The following are some more of the <HI>VISIONS,</HI> which God shewed me, and which I am com∣manded to publish here.</HEAD>
<P>In the month called July, 1791, I was in a vision, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God to the sea coast, in the English channel—a new ridge of unknown land was brought in an in∣stant plain to my eyes, while the finger of a hand wrote, in large capital letters, with great quick∣ness, and a voice pronounced twice from heaven, at the same time,
<Q>SWEDE! SWEDE!</Q></P>
<P>After this I was in a vision in the month of January 1792, and was carried away by the Spi∣rit of God to Sweden, when I was made look
<PB N="84" REF="028359_0083_0FD8C606ED475AB8"/>
through a window in a room; I did, and saw a man walk from the side of a great chair, leaving it empty. I could not see his face as he went away, and although I could perceive that he had committed any crime, I thought with myself that he had been doing wrong. Immediately the an∣gel that stood by me said, The chair means the chair of state; and that man you saw will make it empty. The king of Sweden is <HI>delivered over for death,</HI> and that is the very man that will shoot him.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange is closely pursued like∣wise, but he is not delivered over yet.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and saw the Prus∣sian eagle perched on a chair of state? soon after, on a sudden, I saw the chair, the house, and the whole city where the chair stood, in flames. The angel that was near me, said, he is likewise pur∣sued now.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and the Lord God talked with me, and said, I give you the life of the Swede: but know this for certain, that if yov prevent his death, the man himself will not be∣lieve there was any danger of it. And when you write hereafter of things in this country, you will be called an imposter, a fool, and a liar: you will be imprisoned, and treated very ill. When I see this it will make me angry; I will then be∣gin to kill the people, and I will surely destroy this city.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028359_0084_0FD8C6086F3FA078"/>For which I gave no public information to warn the king of Sweden, and prevented his death. Had this man lived, he would have commanded the German army against France; his private plan was to go through Normandy, close by the sea coast, to be supplied the easier with provisions from England, and endeavour by all possible means, to take the harbour of Brest.</P>
<P>He said to himself, in his own closet, this is the plan I will pursue; It will be giving a mor∣tal blow to the French navy, and getting a safe harbour for our own ships.</P>
<P>All this was made known to me by revelation from the Lord God; and which I communicated to the queen and minister of state in 1792, some time before the provinces of Brittany and Nor∣mandy, shewed any open appearance of hosti∣lity against the present government of France.</P>
<P>In the month of April 1793, I was in a vision, and was carried away in the spirit of God to Russia, where I saw a bear stop to rest itself un∣der a large tree; soon after I beheld a man, that lay concealed among the branches drop down softly, and with a sharp piece of iron, which he held in his hand, stab the bear; pronouncing, as he did so, I have watched a long time for you, but now, I have caught you at last.</P>
<P>I know, by revelation from the Lord God, that this vision means the present empress of
<PB N="86" REF="028359_0085_0FD8C60D85BBE928"/>
Russia; for which, being permitted, I give her this warning.</P>
<P>Let the death of the king of Sweden and France which is but a little time past; the death of the king of Spain and another, which will soon take place, for they are pursued; convince the princes and the people of Europe, that the seventh chap∣ter of Daniel and the second of Haggai are now fulfilling.</P>
<P>At a former time, when, the Lord God was in∣structing me in a knowledge of the laws and other things, relative to the nation I am appointed to govern, he said, in a vision of the night, when I bring princes and people from all nations to bow down to you; when I begin to exalt you above kings of the earth—Be sober, be modest, be rea∣sonable. And immediately after he added, you may inform the king of England that I call you my nephew.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March, 1794, I was in a vision, and saw the sun in its full strength, clear and high up in the firmament: soon after I saw another sun rise on a sudden, equally large as the former, and stand close by it; both shone with equal brightness, and the last as well as the first enlight∣ened the world.</P>
<P>After the first division of this copy was sent to be printed, and even some of it done, the printer was advised not to do it according to my form; for, if he did, prosecution, imprisonment, and
<PB N="87" REF="028359_0086_0FD8C60E6429CC18"/>
perhaps hanging, would be the consequence to him. For which the Lord God commands me to keep back the additional information that otherways would be given, and terminate the book.</P>
<P>I have said already that the sixth chapter of the Revelation was now fulfilling: the <HI>four first seals</HI> are opened, and the covering, which kept the meaning of the prophecies a profound secret un∣til the present time, is removed: <HI>recorded</HI> decrees are held up, and God himself commands a know∣ledge of their contents to be published for the good of all nations. But if I cannot have the commands of God, and a knowledge of his judg∣ments, printed exactly as I write, how is this ex∣tension of mercy to be known over Europe, and the people of London informed of any danger that is past or any danger that is to come? All the prophecies in the Scripture were given by men: the Ninevites were warned through one.</P>
<P>How is the king to save himself from that <HI>re∣corded,</HI> determined, unavoidable death, which all the powers of armies cannot prevent? How is Lon∣don and the parliament to be saved, when they are recorded in the scripture of truth to be destroyed? How is England, Europe, and most parts of the world to be saved, when they are recorded to be fil∣led with blood by war, and to be made desolate for ever by earthquakes, if the person I employ is de∣trered
<PB N="88" REF="028359_0087_0FD8BD6CC07E4050"/>
by the fears of persecution and evil, from printing the full copy, exactly as I give it?</P>
<P>The king of Egypt and his people were de∣stroyed, because they would not believe Moses; but the king of Nineveh and his people were saved, because they did believe Jonah and re∣form.</P>
<P>The king of England, the chancellor of the Exchequer, secretaries of state, other members of administration, and as many members of both houses of parliament, as my ability will allow; the bishops, judges, and all the foreign ambas∣sadors in London; will have a book sent to each.</P>
<P>On account of my being insulted, because the Jews do not believe in the first book, by a public acknowledgment of it, the Lord God commands me to remind all men of what is wrote in that book, and to say, that as the Jews do not be∣lieve in Christ, it cannot he expected that they will in me; <HI>neither are they,</HI> until I am revealed in a similar manner to Moses in Egypt, but with the additional power of fire as his sign, to make them.</P>
<P>The night before I had finished this book for the press, the Lord God shewed it to me in a vi∣sion, ready printed, holding it up at the same time by one leaf, and shaking all the others open, while he pronounced, in strong clear words, and commanded me to writ them down exactly as he spoke, for universal information:</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="028359_0088_0FD8C616A72AB008"/>There is nothing in this book that the English law can take hold of:—So says him that Isaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Counsellor.</P>
<P>I request every body, in all nations, to read this book with attention, and receive it favoura∣bly; for although the information and warning it contains is through me, yet it is not mine, but God's.</P>

<P>For Christ is the head of all prophecy; from him flows the Divine Spirit of Truth: he is Lord and God; he is all that Isaiah says of him —the Wonderful Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</P>
<P>Moses was but a man, and to a man like him∣self he alludes; as the Lord himself likewise de∣clares in the three following verses.</P>

<P N="29">29. Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.</P>
<P N="30">30. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him, in the wilderness of mount Si∣na, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</P>

<P N="37">37. This is that Moses, which said to the chil∣dren of Israel, a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me.</P>
<P>This is he <HI>(meaning Moses still, and not the pro∣phet alluded to in the preceding verse; who was not Christ neither as has always been erroneously sup∣posed)</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="028359_0092_0FD8C62080433320"/>
that was in the church, (meaning the ta∣bernacle) in the wilderness <HI>with the angel</HI> which spoke <HI>to him</HI> in mount Sina.</P>
<P N="39">39. To whom our fathers would not obey, (meaning Moses) but thrust him from them, (meaning Moses: often did he fast, and pray, that God might not destroy the congregation,) and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt.</P>
<P>Who was the conspicuous person that the an∣gel constantly accompanied, manifested him to, and talked with during forty years in the wilder∣ness, according to the 38th verse, but Moses? Who did the angel speak to in mount Sina from a flame of fire in a bush? St. Stephen meant no other here than Moses.</P>
<P N="40">40. Saying to Aaron, make us Gods to go before us; for, as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</P>
<P>Expounders of the Scriptures have always sup∣posed that St. Stephen, by repeating in this chap∣ter the verses I have inserted from Deuteronomy, meant Christ to be the prophet alluded to by Mo∣ses, which is, <HI>like himself,</HI> to collect and lead home the Jewe; but he does not; he repeats it as an historical account, to remind the council, before which he stood for judgment, that as their fathers had before rejected Moses in the wilder∣ness, so did they their children reject Christ at Jerusalem. But in no one part does he, or St.

<HEAD><HI>Revelation to St. John,</HI> Chap. xii.</HEAD>
<P>St. John the Apostle in this chapter describes a woman as cloathed with the sun, <HI>the moon un∣der her feet (meaning darkness, or the Turkish em∣pire in Asia,)</HI> and a crown of twelve stars on her head. The sun alluded to is not the sun in the firmament, neither is that sun the Lord Jesus Christ, as has been always erroneously supposed. The woman is not the church, nor yet the Bles∣sed Virgin, the mother of Christ, as has always been likewise erroneously supposed; but that sun, means an entire man composed of flesh and blood like any other; and that woman the princess of Israel. The prince is represented as a sun, be∣cause that through him God will enlighten the world with more knowledge than ever it had yet, and give a fresh manifestation of his mercy to prolong its duration. The woman, as his con∣sort, is represented as clothed with him, and also as wearing a crown of twelve stars; because he, as her husband, is prince of the twelve tribes.</P>
<P>The child, <HI>who will govern all nations immedi∣ately under and next to God,</HI> being caught up to God and to his throne, means no more than the child going up to Jerusalem, where the throne of

The woman's going into the wilderness, means going up to Jerusalem al∣so: the words into the wilderness are mentioned because the city is situated <HI>far inland</HI> from the sea.

<P>At the time God was explaining this chapter to me, he said, when I give you power to destroy that man from the face of the earth, you will melt into pity and spare his life; for which all my people will universally blame you, because he is their enemy and oppressor.

a future time; a man, a human being, like any other that is composed of flesh and blood; but not the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God; who who always was, and always will be, the head of the heathen, and all nations. The promise was made from God to David, to be fully accom∣plished in that man's descendant, which de∣scendant is myself; I shall, under God, rule all nations under the government of the Gospel to fulfil that covenant to David, and the promise of it by revelation to myself.</P>

<P>That Christ, the Saviour of the world, should be born of a virgin, and that he should be called the Wonderful Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace, Isa∣iah the prophet sufficiently testifies: that Christ was so born, St. Matthew the Apostle witnesses in the first chapter of that part of the Gospel wrote by him. And Christ himself says in the twenty-second chapter, when speaking to the Pharisees—"What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David. He says to them, How then does David, in spi∣rit call them Lord, saying, the Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstood? if David then call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man, from that day forth, ask him any more question."</P>

<P>In the month called June, 1701, at the hour of two in the afternoon, I law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and, from the wrist downwards, like the hand of a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, with the fore finger pointed out, appear on a sudden a little above the height of my head, near the door, on the wall or partition of the room I was then in. After this I was informed, by revelation, at night, from the Lord God, that at meant the speedy end of the present king of England and his empire, like Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azzar and Babylon, both of, which would soon be destroyed.</P>
<P>In the month called May, 1792, I was in a

vision, and receiving instruction from God of fu∣ture things: he shewed me the queen, greatly alarmed at his judgments, by my revelation, with the power of fire; and immediately she cri∣ed out, the Lord have mercy on us! we shall all be destroyed! we shall all be destroyed!</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision again, and the Lord God shewed me the present queen of England, coming towards me, slow, trembling, and afraid. This was communicated, with other things, to William Pitt, in the month called June, 1792. And likewise, informing him, at the same time, that it would most certainly be fulfilled: It will; it is established with God, and will be so.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the month of June, 1792, I was in a vision, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God, to the palace called St. James's, where I saw the present king of England; he rose from his seat on seeing me, and immediate∣ly sent me his own magnificent star, at the same time breathing on it, and kissing, as if kissing to take a last farewel; yet not with grief and re∣luctance to give, but with evident satisfaction. Why the king of England should take his own conspicuous ornament, and send it to me, was a thing that I was greatly astonished at; I wished to know the meaning, but could not discover, until a loud voice pronounced, down from hea∣ven, the Lord God delivers his life over into your hands, and he will give you any thing to

preserve it. This vision, with others, and other things, was communicated, by Divine command, to the king in 1792. The letter which contain∣ed it, with others to the king, the queen, and the chancellor of the exchequer, were put into the penny post-office, to be sent by that convey∣ance, according to the directions I received on that head by revelation from God.</P>
<P>1794. This day, called Thursday, and the 12th of the month called June, I was in a vision, at the hour of two in the afternoon, when the Lord God spoke to me in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice of great quick∣ness, carrying me away to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk of England at the same time, and saying, there is one of twenty. The whole place rung and trembled with the clear, but sharp sound of his words. It is by his sacred and particular command I mention this vision in writing.</P>
<P>The 13th, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the morning, the Lord God said to me, among other things, in a vision, you see those people do not believe, neither will they for all your endeavours; why then do you con∣tinue to entreat me for them?</P>
<P>The 14th, in the morning, the Lord God spoke to me, and said, the judgment is now against this nation; the thunder, just past, was to proclaim it: Pharaoh is appointed to die, and his government to be destroyed; the priests, and all the abominable idolatries of Egypt, shall pe∣rish, never to be found any more.</P>

<HEAD>In the same manner that the Lord God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the prophet Samuel, and revealed a knowledge of his, designs, in the same manner also he speaks to me, and reveals a knowledge of his will.</HEAD>

<P N="1">1. And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli; and the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</P>
<P N="2">2. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes be∣gan to wax dim, that he could not see, and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Lord called, Samuel; and he an∣swered, here am I. And he ran unto Eli, and said, here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</P>
<P N="6">6. And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel rose, and went to Eli, and said, here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</P>
<P N="7">7. Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him.</P>
<P N="8">8. And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose, and went to Eli, and said,
<PB N="104" REF="028359_0103_0FD8C63C31016CE8"/>
here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli per∣ceived that the Lord had called the child.</P>
<P N="9">9. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down, and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Sa∣muel went and lay down in his place.</P>
<P N="10">10. And the Lord came and stood, and called, as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samu∣el answered, speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. And the Lord said to Samuel, behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</P>
<P N="12">12. In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</P>
<P>1794. The 25th of the month called June, the Lord God said to me, in a vision of the night, on my bed, in seven days more the judgment will be on this nation.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vision, and the Lord God brought close to me, that I might hear the report of a gun that was fired, and see a man privately shoot at another to kill him: it was so near, that I saw the flash, and smelt the powder. Before the death of the king of Sweden I was shewn, in a vision, similar to this, that he would be deliver∣ed over from the protection of God, to be shot.</P>
<P>I know, because the Lord God has explained it to me by revelation, that this vision means, the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n fired at to be the present king of England
<PB N="105" REF="028359_0104_0FD8C64355C66EB0"/>
He will be shot, but not killed; he will be wound∣ed, but not mortally.</P>
<P>He has not believed me at any time, although I fully informed him in 1792, and since, that it would be so; neither will he, until the very evil is visited on him: and visited on him, to increase his distress, at a time when he is surrounded with danger, and loaded with trouble: it most certain∣ly will. Then the king of England will be con∣vinced, by woeful and feeling proofs, but it will be very late:—comparatively, when death knocks at the door, that he despised the offered mercy of God in 1792, and constantly since his best friend, among mankind, as false.</P>
<P>In the month called March, 1794, I was in a vision, and the Lord God shewed me a large and very tall oak tree; it stood alone; it was entirely wi∣thered, and all its branches were cut off While I was considering the tree, its lonely condition and nakedness, I heard a very loud voice call out of heaven, how down that tree. Immediately the the tree was covered with a thick cloud of dark∣ness, and an angel descended from God, who struck the tree with so violent a blow that it fell to the ground, and in its fall it made a great noise.</P>
<P>1794. First of the month called July, the Lord God said to me, among other things, in a vision, early in the morning, for I had been earnestly praying to him the evening before to hasten my revelation to the Jews, and inform me how long
<PB N="106" REF="028359_0105_0FD8C6446E0ADD80"/>
it would be until it took place; because I was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ly used as an impostor, for publishing his com∣mands, by wicked men; every one of them led on under the influence of an evil spirit—You must be at Constantinople, in your way to Jeru∣salem, by this time next year.</P>
<P>The 2d of the same month, the Lord God said to me, in a vision on my bed, early in the morning, in breaking bread you must not any longer say, to any person, peace and friendship, but salvation only to the spiritual.</P>
<P>I know, by revelation, that Christopher Hove, clergyman, who was unjustly tried, condemned, and put to death in London, in the year of 1651, had the divine Spirit of the living God, and pro∣phesied from it. He testified of me at that time under different names, though all of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one and the same person; that of a Bright Star, as a Sound of Thunder in the ears of the wicked, a Lantern to the Jews, and a Great Man.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to give this tes∣timony, and also to say, that he will soon send, it anger, the visitation of his judgment on London, and call her to a strict account for shedding not only the blood of this righteous man, but likewise all his other faithful witnesses. I know likewise, by revelation from the Lord God, and am com∣manded to write it down, that John Maximilian Dau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was sanctified by the Divine Spirit of Truth, and prophesied, under its sacred direction, in the

<P>The Lord God commands me to inform you, John Wright, that you are of the Hebrews, of the tribe of Levi, descended from Aaron the high priest, by Phineas, Zadok, and Ezra; for which the covenant to your forefather, Phineas, of an everlasting priesthood, is renewed, given to you, to be manifested in you.</P>

<P N="10">10. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</P>
<P N="11">11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</P>

<P N="13">13. And he shall have it, and his seed after him; even the covenant of an everlasting priest∣hood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an attonement for the children of Israel.</P>
<P>This is the recorded testimony which the Lord my God commands me to give; and to say to you likewise, you are sanctified by the Holy Ghost, the Divine Spirit of Truth.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say to all you, professing Christianity, whom I have, by his sacred direction, acknowledged to be of the He∣brews,

<P>Neither mind the people that blaspheme God, and revile you for believing in his testimonies: the wicked have always rose against the righte∣ous, and this land, like Egypt of old, has many task-masters to abuse and oppress in it. There∣fore comfort yourselves in the knowledge of the promises of God to his servants: For I declare, by his sacred command, that the visible Jews are but few in number, compared to the great mul∣titude professing Christianity, but all descended from the former Jews in the land of Israel, the forefathers of the present visible ones; which were, at different times, led captives into all nations: your lives are long, their's but short; you are the holy seed, the people and saints of the Most High; to whom, and your children for ever, belongs the possession and government of his kingdom.</P>
<P>The Lord God, who was the Lord Jesus Christ, commands me now, and not until now, to insert the following testimonies, <HI>as a warning to all blasphemers,</HI> and as a reason to all men, that do not know, why he said to me, in the

<P>As there is in truth no Lord but God, no man ought to assume his sacred name.

To pursue then any longer such a false form of ordination and consecration, is not only dishonourable to the king, parliament, and people of England, but also a reproach to the bi∣shops to attempt to give, and to the clergy to kneel down to receive.</P>
<P>Turn from such deceitful unmanly ways, and endeavour to live long; for it is the word of God through a man that points at the crime, and warns you to forsake, what must, if you do not, lead to certain death: for, believe me, the day of destruction to punish disobedience to the Gos∣pel is so very nigh, that it will take place before

the commencement of eight months from this day.</P>
<P>Look at your wives, your children, and all that is dear to you on earth; then consider how great the blessing to have them, to live with, and possess them; but how terrible the evil to sepa∣rate, to be burnt with fire—to die, and lose them for ever.</P>
<P>Remember, God created man in his own image and likeness, and created the earth for his use; that man might believe in him, and o∣bey his commands.</P>
<P>He brought the children of Israel out of Egypt to conduct them to the promised land, but when they disobeyed him in the wilderness, he destroy∣ed thousands of them. He burnt Sodom and Gomorrah, because the people were wicked; but he saved Nineveh, which was also denounc∣ed, because the people repented.</P>
<P>The Lord God is great, merciful, and compas∣sionate to forgive all that do entreat and obey his commands; but be assured, he is also great, mighty, and powerful, jealous of his sacred name and honour when given to men: and he can do now what he did of old, <HI>they are recorded for our example and warning,</HI> that is, overthrow cities, and destroy multitudes in an instant.</P>
<P>Life, blessing, and peace, is the inheritance of the servants, the saints, and people of the Most High.</P>

<P N="12">12. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood: and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind: and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</P>
<P N="15">15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondsman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</P>

<HEAD><HI>Second Book of Esdras,</HI> Chap. ii.</HEAD>
<P N="42">42. I Esdras, saw upon the Mount Zion a great multitude of people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.</P>
<P N="43">43. And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I mar∣velled at greatly.</P>
<P N="44"><PB N="122" REF="028359_0121_0FD8C69626E0E568"/>44. So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these? He answered and said to me, these be they that have put off the mortal cloathing, and put on the immortal: (It means the Jews, who, when I am revealed, will acknowledge that the Lord Christ is the Lord God: then they will put off the mortal cloathing unbelief and error, and put on the immortal cloathing of faith and righteousness) and have confessed the name, of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.</P>
<P N="46">46. Then said I to the angel, what young per∣son is that which crowns them, and gives them palms in their hands. So he answered and said to me, it is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then I began greatly to recommend them that stood so stifly for the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Son of God, alluded to here, is not the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, as has been al∣ways erroneously supposed; but a human being, of flesh and blood, like any other. It is a man, and but a man; though recorded, and honoured with being called the Son of God. It is myself, who am the man that will be made that prince, alluded to by Ezekiel, in the xliv. xlv. xlvi. and xlviii. chapters of this Prophecy; and in the se∣cond chapter of Haggai, <HI>when kingdoms are con∣vulsed with violence and war, with the fall of thrones and the destruction of armies,</HI> as a promised, a de∣signed signet, manifested to the world by the
<PB N="123" REF="028359_0122_0FD8C676CAE0F150"/>
great power and extended goodness of God. It is that man, whom God has designed to be the visible prince of Israel. As a believer in God, <HI>by, and through Christ, the divine Spirit of Truth,</HI> and an obeyer of his commands, he is a son, an adopted son: so is every man under heaven an acknowledged son, whether rich or poor, that does the same; and so is every woman likewise, an adopted, an acknowledged daughter.</P>
<P>Remember the words of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, where he says, after this manner therefore pray ye, Our Father which art in hea∣ven, &amp;c. As God then is our father, we, that acknowledge and pray to him as such, are surely his sons and daughters.</P>
<P>All that believe in the testimony of God by me, which he now commands me to make known, are his people, a part <HI>(because the visible Jews are the great body)</HI> of that innumerable multitude, shewn by the angel to Esdras, crowned, and re∣ceiving palms.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to remind all people of the loud thunder that was on the 7th of August last, and to say, it was a threat from him to destroy London, sooner than suffer me to be hurt: take it for a warning, and beware of the dreadful consequences that will most certain∣ly ensue, if a similar injury is intended against me: for if you, the English Government, is de∣termined to molest me, the Lord God is also de∣termined
<PB N="124" REF="028359_0123_0FD8C697B5201130"/>
to oppose you; and will visit with death on his enemies, and with destruction on their ca∣pital. For the English Government, <HI>both what is called civil and ecclesiastical,</HI> in its present form, will, by the fierce anger and determined judg∣ment of the Lord God, be removed, annihilated, and utterly destroyed, before the expiration of ten months from this day.</P>
<P>For those unhappy men, which compose it, as if the injustice of the present war was not suffici∣ent to provoke him, have imprudently gone on, adding evil to evil, and now, more than before, publicly encourage blasphemy against him, and abuse against his prophet. Why do they do so? said the Lord God to me. Why? because you have not their <HI>mark,</HI> but my seal; you have not their authority, the laying on the hands of their bishops, to give the Holy Ghost to prophecy by, but my Spirit, <HI>yet those are the men that pretend to judge of spirits,</HI> to discern the good from the evil: they suppose every man, that speaks or writes un∣der the power and influence of God, is a false prophet, an impostor under delusion; because the words of truth, by him, go to contradict their mark, their human ordinances, and politi∣cal forms of prayer.</P>
<P>The Lord Jesus Christ says, in the fifteenth chapter of his Gospel by St. Matthew, "but in vain they do worship me, teaching, for doctrines, the commandments of men.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="028359_0124_0FD8C678F46D10F8"/>And because the annunciation of my kingdom of peace and preservation, brings with it the sentence of death against their kingdom of war and human destruction; therefore, hear what the Lord God says to me by revelation, and com∣mands me to write, that, as they have encourag∣ed blasphemy against me, they shall not prosper; for I will send a blast on them that will confound all their counsels: and, as they have encouraged abuse against you, whom I sent, and who en∣treated me for their good, I will deliver them over to the power of their enemies; to be hated by every body, despised, and trod under foot like mire in the streets.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say, for the information of the English government, the judges, and all men, that the prisoners, now in confinement, and on trial for their lives, charged with the crime of High Treason against the life of the king of England, are innocent: as such, he requires me to make known to the king his sacred commands in writing, and to publish this for the knowledge of all.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to inform, through this book, all that honour him—his ser∣vants—the peaceable and righteous in all nations, which have had their property, whether in land or money, confiscated, for no other reason than because the nation they belonged to declared war against the nation they lived in, all such proper∣ty,

or its full value, with reasonable interest set the time, shall most surely be restored.</P>
<P>And you, Peter Woulse, one of the Avignon Society, whom the Lord my God commands me to mention here by name, as a testimony of his great regard, your property, confiscated in France, will all be restored with interest, and much kindness shewn to you by the members of its government: they will restore the property of every other <HI>peaceable individual</HI> likewise: by the same divine rule of justice, Spain, England, Prussia, Germa∣ny, Holland, and all other nations in Europe, must restore theirs. For the time of the world is just now come, and God is firmly determined to manifest his mighty power, for the prservation of his people and saints, by fulfilling by me his words in the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, a part of which are— But with righteousness he will judge the poor, and reprove, with equity, for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the road of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Prophet Isaiah,</HI> Chap. xli.</HEAD>
<P N="25">25. I have raised up one from the north, (meaning the revealed Prince of the Hebrews at this time) and he shall come; (meaning to Jeru∣salem,
<PB N="127" REF="028359_0126_0FD8C67AC0CC8378"/>
from that northern part of the world allu∣ded to; England lies in the north, and it is in∣deed the country meant: from the rising of the sun he shall come upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treads clay.</P>
<P>Isaiah stood at Jerusalem when this prophecy was given, writing and recording it by the direc∣tion of God, he looked to the northern part of the world, where this distinguished person, which he so clearly mentions, is first to rise, and then come to Jerusalem, calling on the name of the Lord, from the rising to the setting of the sun; as zealous for an obedience to the Gospel, as David, his father, was for the law: travelling in the mighty strength of the Spirit, and armed with the divine power of fire, like Elijah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malachi, iv. 1. and 5. Isaiah, xi. 4. 11. Esdrass, xiii. 12.</NOTE>, he will subject nations, remove thrones, and burn all rebel princes.</P>
<P N="26">26. Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know; and before the time, (mean∣ing before the prophecy is fulfilled; it being 2461 years from its declaration then to its ac∣complishment, now this present year 2795,) that we may say, He is righteous! yea there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth; yea, there is none that heareth yout words.</P>
<P>The king of England, and the members of his government, the parliament, bishops, judges, and all the ambassadors from foreign nations, in
<PB N="128" REF="028359_0127_0FDA232CB1F6E0D8"/>
London, have received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he information of their fall and destruction; but they all refuse to be∣lieve, and by so doing fulfil exactly what the prophet means, when he says, yea, there is none that heareth your words.</P>
<P N="27">27. The first shall say to Zion, behold, be∣hold them; (meaning the Jews, crouding home to Jerusalem in great multitudes) and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. (It means the revealed prince, returning home with the people, to rebuild the desolate city, and make her rejoice.)</P>
<P N="28">28. For I beheld, and there was no man; e∣ven among them there was no counsellor that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</P>
<P>Here the Holy Ghost, the spirit of God, spoke by Isaiah, as if speaking by myself at this very hour; for I have sent books of the judgments of God to the king of England, and the mem∣bers of his government, his parliament, his bi∣shops, his judges, and all the foreign ambassa∣dors in London, for their respective countries: but to accomplish what is so faithfully recorded by the prophet, where he speaks spiritually as myself—Even among them there was no coun∣sellor that, when I sent to them, could answer a word.</P>

<HEAD>Other Parts of the Revelation to St. John which are to be fulfilled, and which the Lord God com∣mands me now to publish.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xiii. 1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns; and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of Blasphemy.</P>
<P>This beast means the English monarchy; and it is by ships and commerce that it has rose from the sea to such astonishing grandeur and magni∣tude. The heads, horns, and crowns, allude to the many departments of government, and their splendid distinctions. The Blasphemy means the titles given to, and assumed by the king of England; such as, Our most Gracious Sovereign Lord, sacred Person, Majesty, defender of the Faith, and supreme head of the Church; all which names belong to God, he only can be what they express, and when they are applied to any other, the sin is blasphemy in his sight.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</P>
<P>The English monarchy, for being supreme head of the Church, and over the many religious sects tolerated in the country, is the reason that it is,
<PB N="130" REF="028359_0129_0FD8C69EDD864210"/>
for their great number, compared to a leopard full of spots.</P>
<P>As a bear is very strong on his feet, so is the English monarchy: and as a lion roars with his mouth the loudest of any beast, so does the En∣glish monarchy proclaim its greatness more than any other.</P>
<P N="3">3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</P>
<P>The beginning of this verse means the death of Charles the first, king of England: and the dead∣ly wound being healed, means the recovery of monarchy by the restoration of Charles the second. During the interval of time between the death and succession, all the world wondered if the English monarchy would ever be restored again.</P>
<P N="9">9. If any man have an ear let him hear. He that leads into captivity, shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</P>
<P>The leading into captivity means imprisonment and slavery: and killing with the sword, means violence and war. The patience of the saints is, to bear quietly with those evils, and to resist the temptations of wealth to do them: All that have faith in God will not do such things, from a be∣lief that they are offensive, because he commands them not.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="131" REF="028359_0130_0FD8C6808E9A4030"/>11. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</P>
<P>This verse means the Elector of Hanover. Coming up out of the earth, is to signify that his country or government is situated inland. The horns of a lamb, and the voice of a dragon, means that although he is weak in power like a lamb, yet by his voice he can threaten in great and mighty words like a dragon.</P>
<P N="12">12. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It means the elector of Hanover's succession to the crown, place, and power of the former king of England. To fulfil this part of the pro∣phecy given by revelation to St. John, the utter expulsion of the Stuart family must against all human opposition have taken place to admit the elector of Hanover.</P>
<P>A great part of this chapter is taken up in describing the king and parliament. I am com∣manded to inform both of the recorded judg∣ments of God, the dangers which threaten them, and their certainty of taking place, unless they implore him for mercy, and obtain it.</P>
<P>They have individually promised, by their god∣fathers and godmothers, in the sacred covenant of baptism, and acknowledge a confirmation of it by receiving the sacrament, (for both were in∣stituted by the Lord Jesus Christ) to believe in
<PB N="132" REF="028359_0131_0FD8C6A01C54A7B0"/>
him and obey his commands; yet, notwithstand∣ing this heaviest of all obligations which a hu∣man being can enter into, (for it is with his God,) and on the performance of which his sal∣vation depends, the laws they make a part of the Thirty nine Articles, and some of the forms of prayer, used in public worship, goes more to break the covenant of baptism, to dishonour God, and oppose an obedience to his blessed Gospel, than was ever authorised in any other nation.</P>
<P>Without submitting to the forms of law pre∣scribed by act of parliament, which are in direct opposition to the commands of Christ, and very sinful to do, no man can hold any place of profit or trust, enjoy the privilege of freedom, and comparatively to buy or sell.</P>
<P N="17">17. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</P>
<P N="18">18. Here is wisdom. Let him that has un∣derstanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.</P>
<P>This verse means the the English parliament; and although it exceeds the number mentioned here, yet notwithstanding, it is the real and very assembly of men alluded to in the Revelation, by the number of 666.</P>
<P>Because the parliament acknowledge and ad∣dress the king by the divine names which belong
<PB N="133" REF="028359_0132_0FD8C682AA1C70F8"/>
only to God; such as, our most gracious Sove∣reign Lord, Sire, Majesty, and honour him with equal humility in supplication, when they require any thing, as if he really was the Lord of heaven and earth; such as, Humbly praying that your Majesty would be most graciously pleased, &amp;c. Therefore God, in his great anger, being jea∣lous of his name and honour, calls the king a beast, and the parliament his image and number.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xiv. 1. And I looked, and lo, a lamb stood on Mount Sion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his father's name written in their fore-heads</P>
<P>The lamb, mentioned here, means myself as Prince of the Hebrews; and Mount Sion, Jeru∣salem: the hundred and forty-four thousand with me, having the name of my father wrote in their foreheads, means not only the visible Jews of the twelve tribe, but likewise the invisible—it com∣prehends all of Hebrew extraction that will be∣lieve in the testimony of God by me.</P>
<P N="6">6. And I saw another angel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel, to preack to them that dwell on the earth, and to every na∣tion, and kindred, and tongue, and people; saying with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</P>
<P N="8">8. And there followed another angel, saying,
<PB N="134" REF="028359_0133_0FD8C6A40E3F8988"/>
Babylon is fallen, is fallen; that great city! be∣cause she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</P>
<P N="9">9. And the third angel followed them, saying, with a loud voice, if any man worship the beast, and his image, and receive his mark in his fore∣head, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the pre∣sence of the lamb: and the smoke of their tor∣ment ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever, receives the mark of his name.</P>
<P N="12">12. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xvi 1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. And the first went, and poured out his vi∣al upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="135" REF="028359_0134_0FD8C684341EBA48"/>4. And the third angel poured out his vial up∣on the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the wa∣ters say, thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and was, and shalt be; because thou hast judg∣ed thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to to drink; for they are worthy.</P>
<P N="10">10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast, and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain; and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and their sores, and repent∣ed not of their deeds.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xxi. 6. And he said to me, it is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: I will give to him that is a-thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</P>
<P N="8">8. But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say to you, George the third, king of England, that immedi∣ately on my being revealed, in London, to the Hebrews as their prince, and to all nations as their governor, your crown must be delivered up
<PB N="136" REF="028359_0135_0FD8C6A52820FAD0"/>
to me, that all your power and authority may in∣stantly cease. On my being revealed, the invisi∣ble power of the angel of God, which gaurds me now, will then become visible as a flame of fire; the very same that accompanied Moses and the children of Israel out of Egypt. I must not ac∣knowledge any superior but the Lord Christ, who is the Lord God: and as a man raised up, like David, by him to be a prince, he commands me to allow no equal, but instantly to burn out of his kingdom the rebellious and disobedient. Read the xli. chap. and verse 25, of Isaiah.</P>
<P>Be advised by this, for evil is going to be let loose; when it is, the king of England will no more believe the signs of God by me than the king of Egypt would by Moses; therefore, de∣sire your servants to deliver to you all letters and messages from me; for, it is for your contempt to me that your country is ordered to be invaded, and your power to be destroyed. The tall oak, with all its branches cut off, mentioned in one of the visions of God, in the preceding part of this book, means yourself and family.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to say to you, Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, that as you are reviled and considered, by your former acquaintances, as ruined and lost, for speaking the truth as he manifested it to you, for publishing your testi∣mony of me, his servant, you shall, by the ex∣piration of three months, from this day, have
