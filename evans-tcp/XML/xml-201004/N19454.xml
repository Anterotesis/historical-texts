<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FUTURE generations will per∣haps view the late revolution in North America, as the most singular phaenomenon that ever appeared in the political hemisphere of any na∣tion.</P>
<P>To point out the gradual steps by which America finally obtained her independence, to describe those terrible scenes of rapine, blood, and slaughter, which accompanied those struggles, so fatal to thousands of brave officers and men on both sides, and so ruinous to the sinances of the mother-country, are principally the objects of this epitome.</P>
<P>In the execution of this business, we have endeavored to divest our∣selves of every spark of national prej∣udice, and have therefore contented ourselves with barely relating facts, without presuming to give our opin∣ion
<PB REF="025347_0004_0FCCDB8687763B88"/>thereon, wishing to leave our readers the sole power of judging for themselves.</P>
<P>Besides the detail of these impor∣tant events, we have given an ac∣count of the customs and manners of the original inhabitants of North America, and such as they nearly are at this day. We have also shewn at what time, and by what causes, the British colonies in North America were first settled, and have marked their rise from their original insignificance, till they be∣came <HI>Thirteen United and Independent States.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NORTH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to describe what America is at present, or by what means she became independent of the mo∣ther country, it cannot be disagreeable to our readers, to be informed of the persons, customs, and manners, of the original in∣habitants of North America.</P>
<P>The native American indians are tall and strait in their limbs beyond the pro∣portion of most nations. Their bodies are strong, but more fitted to endure much hardship, than to continue long at any ser∣vile work, which they cannot support. Their bodies and heads are flattish;
<PB N="14" REF="025347_0012_0FCCFEECAECDF2E8" MS="y"/>their features are even and regular, but their countenances fierce; their hair long, black, lank, and very strong, but without beards. The colour of their skin is a red∣ish brown, which most of them admire, and take proper methods to improve.</P>
<P>The Europeans, on their first arrival in America, found the Indians quite naked, except those parts, which it is common for the most uncivilised people to conceal. Since that time, they have generally a coarse blanket to cover them, which they buy from their neighbours. The whole tenor of their lives is of a piece: they are hardy, poor, and squalid; and their edu∣cation, from their infancy, is solely direct∣ed to fit their bodies for the mode of life they pursue, and to form their minds to inflict and endure the greatest evils. Their only occupations are hunting and war, for agriculture is left to their women.</P>
<P>As soon as their hunting season is over, which they go through with much patience and in which they exert great ingenuity, they pass the rest of their lives in entire indolence. They sleep half the day in their huts, and observe no bounds of de∣cency in their eating and drinking. Be∣fore the Europeans discovered them, they had no spirituous liquors; but now, the
<PB N="15" REF="025347_0013_0FCCFEF0623CF038"/>acquirement of these is the principal ob∣ject of their pursuit.</P>
<P>The indians are grave, even to sadness, in their deportment upon any serious occa∣sion, observant of those in company, re∣spectful to the old, and of a temper cool and deliberate. They are never in haste to speak before they have thought well of the matter, and are sure the person, who sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke before them, has finished all he has to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They have, therefore, the greatest contempt for the vivacity of the Euro∣peans, who interrupt each other, and fre∣quently speak all together. In their pub∣lic councils and assemblies, every man speaks in his turn, according as his years, his wisdom, or his services to his country, have ranked him. Not a word, not a whisper, not a murmur is heard from the rest while he speaks; no indecent condem∣nation, no ill-timed applause. The younger class attend for their instruction, and here they learn the history of their nation; here they are inflamed with the songs of those who celebrate the warlike actions of their ances∣tors; and here they are taught what are the interests of their country, and how to pur∣sue them.</P>
<P>Though the American Indian is nat∣urally humane and hospitable, yet, to the enemies of his country, or to those who
<PB N="16" REF="025347_0014_0FCCFEF36D9F5628"/>have privately offended him, he is impla∣capable. He conceals his resentments, he appears reconciled, till, by some treachery or surprise, he has an opportunity of exe∣cuting an horrible revenge. No length of time is sufficient to allay his resentment, no distance of place great enough to pro∣tect the object; he crosses the steepest mountains, he pierces the most impervious forests, and traverses the most hideous bogs and deserts for some hundreds of miles, bearing the inclemency of the seasons, the fatigue of the expedition, the extremes of hunger and thirst, with patience and cheerfulness, in hopes of surprising his enemy, on whom he exercises the most shocking barbarities.</P>
<P>The Americans have scarce any tem∣ples; for, as they live by hunting, inhabit mean cottages, and are given to change their habitation, they are seldom very reli∣gious. Some appear to have little ideas of God; others entertain better notions, and hold the existence of the Supreme Being, eternal and uncorruptible, who has power over all. Satisfied with owning this, which is traditionary among them, they pay him no sort of worship.</P>
<P>The darling passion of the Americans is liberty, and that in its fullest extent: to liberty the native Indians sacrifice every
<PB N="17" REF="025347_0015_0FCCFEF44BAE2878"/>thing. This is what makes a life of un∣certainty and want supportable to them, and their education is directed in such a manner as to cherish this disposition to the utmost. They are indulged in all manner of liberty; they are never, upon any ac∣count, chastised with blows, and very rarely even chidden.</P>
<P>Though some tribes are found in Amer∣ica with a king at their head, yet his power is rather persuasive than coercive, and he is reverenced as a father, more than feared as a monarch. He has no guards, no prisons, no officers of justice. In some tribes, there are a kind of nobility, who, when they come to years of discretion, are entitled to a place and vote in the councils of the nation. But among the Five Na∣tions, or Iroquois, the most celebrated commonwealth of North America, and in some other nations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is no other qual∣ification absolutely necessary for the head∣men, but age, with ability and experience in their affairs.</P>
<P>Whenever any affair of consequence is to be transacted, they appoint a feast, of which almost the whole nation partakes. There are smaller feasts on matters of less general concern, to which none are invited but those who are engaged in that particular business. At these feasts it is against all
<PB N="18" REF="025347_0016_0FCCFEF79A708A18"/>rule to leave any thing; so that, if they cannot eat all, what remains is thrown into the fire. They look upon fire as a thing sacred, and in all probability their feasts were anciently sacrifices. Before the entertainment is ready, the principal person begins a song, the subject of which is the fabulous or real history of their na∣tion, the remarkable events which have happened, and whatever matters may con∣duce to their honor or instruction. The others sing in their turn, they have dances too, with which they accompany their songs, chiefly of a martial kind; and no solemnity or public business is carried on without such songs and dances.</P>
<P>The charge of the internal peace and or∣der is likewise committed to the same council of the elders, which regulates whatever regards the external policy of the state. Their suits are few, and quickly decided, having neither property nor art enough to render them perplexed or te∣dious.</P>
<P>The loss of any of their people, whe∣ther by war or a natural dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, is lament∣ed by the whole town he belongs to. In such circumstances no business is taken in hand, however important, nor any rejoic∣ings permited, however interesting the occa∣sion, until all the pious ceremonies due to
<PB N="19" REF="025347_0017_0FCCFEF9D5C234A8"/>the dead are performed, which are always discharged with the greatest solemnity. The dead body is washed, anointed, and painted, so as in some measure to abate the horrors of death. Then the women la∣ment the loss with the most bitter cries, and the most hideous howlings, intermixed with songs, which celebrate the great ac∣tions of the deceased, and those of his an∣cestors. The men mourn in a less ex∣travagant manner. The whole village at∣tends the body to the grave, which is then interred, habited in the most sumptuous ornaments. With the body of the deceas∣ed are placed his bow and arrows, with what he valued most in his life, and pro∣visions for the long journey he is to take. Feasting attends this, as it does every so∣lemnity.</P>
<P>No instances of regard to their deceased friends are so striking as what they call the Feast of the Dead, or the Feast of Souls. The day of this ceremony is appointed in the council of their chiefs, who give or∣ders for every thing that may enable them to celebrate it with pomp and magnificence. The neighbouring people are invited to par∣take of the feast, and to be witnesses of the solemnity. At this time, all who have died since the last solemn feast of that kind, are taken out of their graves; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who
<PB N="20" REF="025347_0018_0FCCFEFBFACE69B0"/>have been intered at the greatest distance from the villages are diligently sought after, and brought to this great rendezvous of sepulchral relicts.</P>
<P>The opening of these tombs displays one of the most striking scenes that can be con∣ceived. — This humiliating portrait of hu∣man misery, exhibited in so many images of death, wherein a thousand various shapes of horror are depicted, according to the dif∣ferent ravages that time has made; forms altogether a scene too indelicate to be here described. I know not which ought to affect us most, the horror of so striking a sight, or the tender piety and affection of those poor people towards their departed friends.</P>
<P>This strange festival is the most magnifi∣cent and solemn of any they have, not only on account of the great concourse of natives and strangers, and of the pompous re-interment they give to the dead, whom they dress in the finest skins they can get, after having exposed them some time in this pomp, but for the games of all kinds which they celebrate upon the occasion, in the spirit of those, which the ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated upon simi∣lar occasions. In this manner do they en∣deavor to sooth the calamities of this life, by the honors they pay to the dead. Though
<PB N="21" REF="025347_0019_0FCCFEFD5C893CA0" MS="y"/>among these savage nations this custom is impressed with strong marks of the ferocity of their nature; yet an honour to the dead, a tender feeling of their absence, and a revival of their memory, are some of the most excellent means of softening our rugged nature into humanity.</P>
<P>Though the women in America have generally the laborious part of oecon∣omy upon themselves, yet they are far from being the slaves they appear, and are not at all subject to the great subordina∣tion, in which they are placed in countries where they seem to be more respected. On the contrary, they hold their councils, and have their share in all deliberations that concern the state; nor are they sound in∣ferior to the part they act. Polygamy is practised by some nations, but it is not general. In most places, they content themselves with one wife; but a divorce is admitted, and for the same causes that it was allowed among the Jews, Greeks, and Romans. No nation of the Americans is without a regular marriage, in which there are many ceremonies. Incontinent before marriage, after wedlock the chastity of their women is remarkable. The punish∣ment of the adultress, as well as that of the adulterer, is in the hands of the hus∣band himself, and it is often severe, being
<PB N="22" REF="025347_0020_0FCCFF01F4713778" MS="y"/>inflicted by him who is at once the party and the judge. Their marriages are not fruitful, seldom producing above two or three children; and from hence we may derive the principal cause of the depopula∣tion of America.</P>
<P>The manner of their preparing for war, and their mode of carrying it on, seem pe∣culiar to themselves. Almost the sole oc∣cupation of the American Indian is war, or such an exercise as qualifies him for it. His whole glory consists in this, and no man is at all considered until he has en∣creased the strength of his country with a captive, or adorned his hat with the scalp of one of his enemies. When the an∣cients resolve upon war, they do not al∣ways declare what nation it is they are de∣termined to attack, that the enemy, upon whom they really intend to fall, may be off their guard; and they sometimes even let whole years pass over without committing any act of hostility, that the vigilance of all may be unben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the long continuance of the watch, and the uncertainty of the danger.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they are not idle at home. The principal captain summonses the youths of the town to which he be∣longs, the war-kettle is set on the fire, the war songs and dances commence, the
<PB N="23" REF="025347_0021_0FCCFF04A65BA038"/>hatchet is sent to the villages and allies of the same nation, and the most hideous howlings continue, without intermission, day and night, over the whole tract of country. The women add their cries to those of the men, lamenting those whom they have either lost in war or by natural death, and demanding their places to be supplied by their enemies.</P>
<P>The fury of the nation being thus raised to the greatest height, and all longing to em∣brue their hands in blood, the war captain prepares the feast, which consists of dog's flesh. All that partake of this feast re∣ceive little billets, which are so many en∣gagements they take to be faithful to each other, and obedient to their commander. None are forced to the war; but, when they have accepted this billet, they are looked upon as enlisted, and it is then death to recede. All the warriors in this assem∣bly have their faces blackened with char∣coal, intermixed with dashes and streaks of vermillion, which give them a most horrid appearance. Their hair is dressed up in an odd manner, with feathers of va∣rious kinds.</P>
<P>In this assembly, which is preparatory to their military expedition, the chief be∣gins the war song, which having contin∣ued for some time, he raises his voice to
<PB N="24" REF="025347_0022_0FCCFF0609CF2390"/>the highest pitch, and turning off suddenly in a sort of prayer, he addresses himself to the God of war, whom they call Areskoni. "I invoke thee (says he) to be favorable to my enterprise! I invoke thy care of me and my family! I invoke ye likewise, all ye spirits and daemons good and evil! all ye that are in the skies, or on the earth, or under the earth, to pour destruction on our enemies, and to return me and my compan∣ions safely to my country!" All the war∣riors join him in this prayer with shouts and acclamations. The captain renews his song, strikes his club against the stakes of the cottage, and begins the war-dance, accompanied with the shouts of all his companions, which continue as long as he dances.</P>
<P>On the day appointed for their departure, they take leave of their friends, and change their clothes, or what moveables they have, in token of friendship. Their wives and female relations go out before them, and attend at some distance from the town. The warriors march out all dressed in their finest apparel and most showy ornaments, regularly one after another, for they never march in rank. Their chief walks slowly on before them, singing the death song. while the rest preserve the most profound silence. When they come up to the wo∣men
<PB N="25" REF="025347_0023_0FCCFF06F9C5EAC0" MS="y"/>they deliver to them all their finery, put on their worst clothes, and then pro∣ceed as their commander directs.</P>
<P>The Indians seldom engage in a war upon motives common to Europe: they have no other end but the glory of victory, or the benefit of their slaves, which it ena∣bles them to add to their nation, or sacri∣fice to their brutal fury; and it is very sel∣dom, that they take any pains to give their wars even the colour of justice. They fall sometimes on one nation, and sometimes on another, and surprise some of their hunters, whom they scalp and bring home as prisoners. Their senators wink at this, or rather encourage it, as it tends to keep up the martial spirit of the people, enures them to watchfulness and hardships, and gives them an early taste for blood. The qualities of an indian war are vigilance and attention, and to give and avoid a sur∣prise; and patience and strength to endure the intolerable fatigues and hardships which always attend it.</P>
<P>They often enter a village, while the strength of the nation is employed in hunt∣ing, and massacre all the helpless old men, women and children, or make prisoners of as many as they can manage, or have strength enough to be useful to their na∣tion. They often cut off small parties of
<PB N="26" REF="025347_0024_0FCCFF094C30F0F0" MS="y"/>men in their huntings; but when they dis∣cover an army of their enemies, their way is to throw themselves flat on their faces among the withered leaves, the colour of which their bodies are painted exactly to re∣semble. They generally let a part pass unmolested, and then, rising a little, they take aim, being excellent marksmen, and setting up a tremendous shout, which they call the war-cry, they pour a stream of mus∣ket bullets on the enemy, having long since laid aside the use of arrows. The party at∣tacked returns the same cry. Every man in haste retires behind a tree, returns the fire of the adverse party, as soon as they arise from the ground to give the second discharge.</P>
<P>Having fought sometime in this man∣ner, the party which thinks it has the ad∣vantage rushes out of its cover, with small axes in their hands, which they dart with great address and dexter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty. They redou∣ble their cry, intimidate their enemies with menaces, and encourage each other with a boastful display of their own brave ac∣tions. Thus, being come hand to hand, the contest is soon decided, and the con∣querors satiate their savage fury with the most shocking insults and barbarities to the dead, biting their flesh, tearing their scalps from their heads, and wallowing in their blood, like the wild beasts of the forest.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="025347_0025_0FCCFF0B11513E28"/>
The fate of their prisoners is indeed miserable. During the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ater part of their journey homewards they suffer no in∣jury; but when they arrive at the territo∣ries of the conquering state, or at those of their allies, the people from every village meet them, and think they shew their at∣tachment to their friends by the barbarous treatment of the unhappy victims; who on their arrival at their destined station, gene∣rally bring with them marks of the most cruel and merciless treatment.</P>
<P>The conquerors enter the town in tri∣umph; the war captain waits upon the head men, and in a low voice gives them a circumstantial account of every particu∣lar of the expedition, of the damages the enemy have suffered, and his own loss in it. This being done the public orator relates the whole to the people. Before they yield to the joy which the victory occasions, they lament the friends they have lost in the pursuit of it. The parties most nearly concerned are apparently afflicted with a deep and real sorrow; but, by one of those strange turns of the human mind, fashion∣ed to any thing by custom, as if they were disciplined in their grief, upon the signal for rejoicing, in a moment the tears are wiped from their eyes, and they rush into an
<PB N="28" REF="025347_0026_0FCCFF0C5F6E4F78"/>extravagance and phrenzy of joy for their victory. All this time the fate of the pri∣soners remains undecided, until the old men meet, and determine concerning their distribution.</P>
<P>It is usual to offer a slave to each house that has lost a friend, giving the preference according to the greatness of the loss. The person who has taken the captive at∣tends him to the door of the party's cot∣tage, where he delivers him, and with him gives a belt of wampum, to shew that he has fulfilled the purpose of the expedition, in supplying the loss of a citizen. They for some time view the present that is made them, and according as they think him or her, for the sex matters not, proper or improper for the business of the family, or as they take a capricious liking or displeasure to the countenance of the vic∣tim, or in proportion to their natural bar∣barity, or their resentment for their losses, they decide whether they will receive him into the family, or sentence him to death. If they be received into the fami∣ly, happy is their lot, as they are then ac∣cepted into the place of the father, son or husband that is lost; and they have no oth∣er mark of their captivity, but that of not being suffered to return to their own coun∣try, to attempt which would be certain
<PB N="29" REF="025347_0027_0FCCFF0DD2615A50"/>death. On the contrary, if they dislike the captive, the throw away the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt with indignation. Then it is no longer in the power of any one to save him, the nation is assembled as upon some great solemnity, a scaffold is raised, and the prisoner tied to the stake. He instantly begins his death song, and prepares for the ensuing scene of cruelty with most undaunted courage.— On the other side, they prepare to put it to the utmost proof, with every torment that the mind of man ingenious in mischief can devise.</P>
<P>It would be too shocking for the ear of our youthful reader to be told what inhu∣man tortures are inflicted on him, till at last, one of the chiefs, out of compassion, or weary with cruelty, generally puts an end to his life with a club or a dagger. The body is then put into the kettle, and this barbarous employment is succeded by a feast equally inhuman.</P>
<P>On this occasion, the women, forget∣ting the female nature, and transferring themselves into something worse than fu∣ries, act their parts, and even outdo the men in this scene of horror. The princi∣pal persons of the country set round the stake smoaking, and looking on without the least emotion. What is most extraor∣dinary, the sufferer himself, in the little
<PB N="30" REF="025347_0028_0FCCFF0FAFAC9AE8"/>intervals of his torments, smoaks also, ap∣pears unconcerned, and converses with his torturers about indifferent matters. In∣deed, during the whole time of his exe∣cution there seems a contest between him and them, which shall e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceed, they in in∣flicting the most horrid pains, or he in en∣during them with a firmness and constancy almost above human. Not a groan, not a sigh, not a distortion of countenance, escapes him; he possesses his mind entirely in the midst of his torments; he recounts his own exploits, informs them what cru∣elties he had inflicted upon their country∣men, and threatens them with the revenge that will attend his death; and though his reproa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s exasperate them to a perfect state of madness, rage, and fury, he con∣tinues his reproaches even of their igno∣rance in the act of tormenting, pointing out himself more exquisite methods, and more sensible parts of the body to be af∣flicted.</P>
<P>We do not dwell upon these circum∣stances of cruelty, which so much degrade human nature, out of choice; but as all, who mentions the customs of this people, have very particularly insisted upon their behavior in this respect, and as it seems necessary, in order to give a true idea of their character, we do not choose wholly
<PB N="31" REF="025347_0029_0FCCFF10BA97C568"/>to omit it. It serves to shew, in the strongest light, to what an inconceivable degree of barbarity the passions of men let loose will carry them. It will point out to us the advantages of a religion that teaches a compassion to our enemies, which is nei∣ther known nor practised in other reli∣gions; and it will make us more sensible, than some appear to be, of the value of commerce, the benefits of a civilised life, and the lights derived from literature, which, if they have abated the force of some of the natural virtues by the luxuries which at∣tend them, have taken out likewise the sting of our national vices, and softened the ferocity of the human race, without en∣ervating their courage. On the other hand, the constancy of the sufferer in this trying scene, shows the wonderful powers of an early institution, and a ferocious thirst of glory, which makes men imitate and exceed what philosophy, and even religion, do not produce.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a cursory review of the customs and manners of the original natives of North America, we shall now proceed to give an account of the first set∣tlement of the British colonies, and shew from what small beginnings time has raised them to an immense republic, under the title of the United and Independent States
<PB N="32" REF="025347_0030_0FCCFF13B1BEA650"/>of America. In order to accomplish this matter, we have given a general history of the late war, which ended in the loss of thirteen British American colonies. The different sieges and battles that took place during that period, we shall describe as co∣piously as our narrow limits will permit us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL of the most zealous and eminent protestants, in the reign of Edward VI. opposed the popish ceremo∣nies and habits though otherwise united to their brethren in religious tenets. Hun∣dreds of them fled into foreign parts to avoid persecutions, where they connected themselves with protestants of other na∣tions, who were equally arduous for a ref∣ormation.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, the refugees returned to Eng∣land, loaded with experience and learning, but in the utmost distress and poverty. Those of the clergy who could comply with the Queen's establishment, were quickly preferred; but the rest, after be∣ing permitted to preach a while, were sus∣pended, and reduced to their former indi∣gence.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="025347_0031_0FCCFF1485BF11C0"/>
The clergy and laity, who wished for greater ecclesiastical purity, struggled hard for the abolishment of popish ce∣remonies and habits, or at least, leaving the use of them indifferent in divine ser∣vice, by which, they obtained nothing but the honorable nick name of PURI∣TANS. Queen Elizabeth had enough of the blood of Henry the Eighth, to make her impatient of any opposition to her will, especially in matters of religion, in which she had an high opinion of her own know∣ledge; and, during her whole reign, she kept down the puritans with an uniform and inflexible severity. The merits, however, of their sufferings, the affected plainness of their dress, the gravity of their deportment, and the use of scripture phrases on the most ordinary occasions, and even their names, which had in them something striking and venerable, as being borrowed from the Old Testament, gained them a general es∣teem among sober people of ordinary un∣derstandings.</P>
<P>When King James came to the throne, he had a very fair opportunity of pacifying matters, or, at least he might have left them in the condition he found them. On the contrary, he suffered them to be per∣secuted, but not destroyed; they were ex∣asperated, and yet left powerful; and the
<PB N="34" REF="025347_0032_0FCCFF166AD35D18"/>then ministry, like those who lately lost us our colonies, exposed their own weakness, ignorance, and baseness, by an ill-timed severity.</P>
<P>In this state matters remained, until the accession of Charles the First, when they were far from being mended. This prince, andowed with some virtues, had very few amiable qualities. As grave as the puri∣tans themselves, he could never eagage the licentious part of the world in his fa∣vour; and that gravity being turned against the puritans, made him more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous to them. He gave himself up entirely to the church and churchmen, and he finished his ill-conduct, in this respect, by conferring the first ecclesiastical dignity of the king∣dom, and a great sway in temporal affairs, upon Dr. Laud, who, hardly fit to direct a college, was entrusted with the govern∣ment of an empire.</P>
<P>The puritans considered the most dreary realms, and the most unfrequented regions, where they could enjoy liberty of con∣science, as superior to the most splendid palaces, where they were to be governed by Laud. In consequence of these disaf∣fections, a little colony sailed from Eng∣land, and established itself at a place called New Plymouth, on the continent of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣rica. This happened in 1620.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="025347_0033_0FCCFF178F498748" MS="y"/>
The were but few in number, they landed in a bad season, and were supplied only from their private funds. The winter was premature, and extremely cold. The country was every where covered with wood, and afforded very little for the re∣freshment of persons sickly with such a voyage, or even for the sustenance of an in∣fant people Nearly half of them perished by the scurvy, by want, and the severity of the climate; but those who survived, not dispirited with their losses, nor with the hardships they were still to endure, supported by the vigor which was then the character of Englishmen, and by the satisfaction of finding themselves out of the reach of the spiritual arm, were enabled to procure in this savage country, a tolerable livelihood, and by degrees a comfortable subsistence for themselves and their fa∣milies.</P>
<P>The people of New Plymouth, having cleared the way for other sufferers to settle, in America, with less difficulty and dan∣ger than what they had experienced; the fame of their plantation spreading through the western part of England, and the gov∣ernment in church and state growing every day more oppressive, the territory of the Massachusett's Bay was purchased of the Plymouth council, in 1628, and a com∣pany
<PB N="36" REF="025347_0034_0FCCFF1904A7C1D8"/>soon formed, who consulted on set∣tling a plantation, to which non-conform∣ing puritans might emigrate, in order to en∣joy their own principles in full security.</P>
<P>In 1630, a large company arrived at Salem, consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing of more than fifteen hundred persons, from different counties in England. From the beginning of the colony, until the emigration ceased, in 1640, through a change of affairs in Eng∣land, there arrived in 298 vessels, about 21,200 settlers, men, women, and child∣ren, or four thousand families.</P>
<P>They did not however, all confine themselves to this colony: several families removed to Connecticut River, by mutual agreement with their fellow emigrants, who remained behind. Plantations were formed at Hartford, Windsor, and Wea∣thersfield. The inhabitants being soon after fully fatisfied, that they were out of the Massachusett's limits, and of course its jurisdiction, entered into a combination among themselves, became a body politic, without restraining the freedom of their civil government to the membership of their churches, and proceeded to the choice of magistrates and representatives.</P>
<P>Two large ships arrived at Massachusett's Bay, in 1637, with passengers from Lon∣don. Great pains were taken to prevail
<PB N="37" REF="025347_0035_0FCCFF1B129E6F08"/>upon them to remain in the colony; but they hoped, by moving to a considerable distance, to be out of the reach of a gen∣eral governor, with whom the country was then threatened. They sent to their friends in Connecticut to purchase of the natives the lands lying between them and Hudson's River. They then laid the foun∣dation of a flourishing colony, of which New Haven was the capital. Connecti∣cut and New-Haven continued two distinct colonies for many years. At length the general court of Connecticut determined to prefer an address and petition to Charles the Second, professing their subjection and loyalty to his majesty, and soliciting a royal charter; and John Winthrop, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who had been chosen governor, was appointed to negociate the affair with the king. He succeeded, and a royal charter was ob∣tained, constituting the two colonies for∣ever one body corporate and politic.</P>
<P>Mr. Roger Williams, a pastor of the church of Salem, being banished from the Massachusetts, on account of some reli∣gious disputes, went to the Narraganset country, accompanied with twelve com∣panions, and had land give him by the Indian Sachem Canonicus; of whom he afterwards purchased the large tract, lying between Pawtuchet and Pawturat rivers,
<PB N="38" REF="025347_0036_0FCCFF1C64AF24D0"/>(the great falls and the little falls, as the Indian name signifies) and stiled it <HI>Provi∣dence,</HI> from a sense of God's merciful pro∣vidence to him in his distress.</P>
<P>The authority and power of Miantonomy, another Sachem, and his uncle Canon∣icus, awed all the indians round to assist him and his few associates. When the de∣terminations of the Massachusetts general court, occasioned by what they called an∣tinomian disputes, banished many, and in∣duced others to leave the colony, the heads of the party were entertained in a friendly manner by Mr. Williams, who advised them to seek a settlement on Rhode-Island, in the year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and was very instru∣mental in procuring if of the indian sa∣chems.</P>
<P>Newhampshire and the Main were settled about the same time with the Massachu∣setts, by different proprietors, who had obtained patents, and whose views were to enrich themselves by the fishing trade at sea, and the beaver trade ashore.</P>
<P>The colony of New-York demands our next attention. The Dutch had settled it, and named it the New Netherlands. Charles the Second resolved upon its con∣quest in 1664; and in March granted to his brother, the Duke of York, the re∣gion extending from the western banks of
<PB N="39" REF="025347_0037_0FCCFF1D8D35A720"/>the Connecticut to the eastern shore of the Delaware, together with Long-Island, con∣ferring on him the civil and military pow∣ers of government. Col. Nichols was sent with four frigates and three hundred sol∣diers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o effect the business. The Dutch governor being unable to make resistance, the New Netherlands submitted to the English crown, in September, without any other change than of rulers. Few of the Dutch removed, and Nichols instantly en∣tered upon the exercise of his power, as deputy-governor for the Duke of York, the proprietary.</P>
<P>About the same time, 1664. New Jer∣sey, which was also taken from the Dutch, who were considered as having no right to any of their settlements in these parts of America, were included in the grant to the Duke of York. The Duke disposed of it to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, who being sole proprietors, for the better settlement of it, agreed upon certain constitutions of government, so well liked, that the eastern ports were soon considerably peopled.</P>
<P>Virginia was the original name of all the English North American <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, given in honor to the vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in Queen Eliza∣beth. King James, being applied to, grant∣ed letters patent to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gentlemen, on
<PB N="40" REF="025347_0038_0FCCFF1EF9DFA0C8"/>the 6th of April, 1606, with powers to di∣vide themselves into two distinct compa∣nies, the one consisting of London adven∣turers, called the first, or southern colony of Virginia; the second, or northern colo∣ny composed of merchants, belonging to Bristol, Plymouth, and Exeter. The territory granted to the first, or southern col∣ony was generally called <HI>Virginia,</HI> without any distinguishing epither, and retained that name after the second or northern colony, obtained the name of New England in 1614.</P>
<P>We come next to speak of Maryland. The first emigration to this part of America consisted of two hundred gentlemen of considerable fortune and rank, with their adherents, chiefly Roman Catholics, who hoped to enjoy liberty of conscience un∣der a proprietary of their own profession. They sailed from England in November, and landed in Maryland the beginning of 1633. Gov. Calvert, brother to Lord Baltimore, very wisely and justly purchased, by presents of various goods, the rights of the Indians, and with their free consent took possession of their town, which he called St. Mary's. The country was set∣tled with so much ease, and furnished with so many conveniencies, that emigrants re∣paired thither in such numbers as soon to
<PB N="41" REF="025347_0039_0FCCFF2286D62EE0" MS="y"/>render the colony populous and flourish∣ing.</P>
<P>Carolina follows Maryland in the order of existence. A few adventurers emi∣grated from the Massachusetts, and settled round Cape Fear, about the time of the Restoration They considered mere oc∣cupancy, with a transfer from the natives, without any grant from the king, as a good title upon the lands they possessed. They deemed themselves entitled to the same civil privileges as those of the country from whence they had emigrated. For years they experienced the complicated mis∣eries of want. They solicited the aid of their countrymen, and the general court of Massachusetts, with an attention and hu∣manity which did it the greatest honor, ordered an extensive contribution for their relief,</P>
<P>The final settlement of the province was effected equally through the rapacity of the courtiers of Charles the Second, and his own facility in rewarding those, to whom he was greatly indebted, with a lib∣erality that cost him little. The pretence, which had been used on former occasions, of a pious zeal for the propagation of the gospel among the indians, was successively employed to procure a grant of the im∣mense region, lying between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6th de∣gree
<PB N="42" REF="025347_0040_0FCCFF2382D30D90"/>of North latitude, and the river of St. Matheo, under the thirty first degree. In March, 1663, this territory was erected into a province by the name of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and conferred on Lord Clarendon, the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Craven, Lord Berkeley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Car∣teret, Sir John Colleton, and Sir William Berkeley, as absolute lord proprietaries, for ever, saving the allegiance due to the crown.</P>
<P>Pennsylvania and the Delaware counties next demand our attention. Mr. William Penn, one of the joint purchasers of the western part of the Jerseys, having re∣ceived the most exact information of the country to the westward of the Delaware, while engaged in the administration of the joint purchase, became desirous of acquir∣ing a seperate estate.</P>
<P>He presented a petition to Charles the Second in June, 1680, stating not only his relationship to the late admiral, but that he was deprived of a debt due from the crown, when the Exchequer was shut. He prayed for a grant of lands, lying to the northward of Maryland, and westward of the Delaware; and added that by his interest, he should be able to settle a pro∣vince, which might, in time, repay his claims. Having a prospect of success, he
<PB N="43" REF="025347_0041_0FCCFF25383436D0"/>copied from the charter of Maryland the sketch of a patent, which in November was laid before the attorney general for his opinion.</P>
<P>Penn had the same object in view as Lord Baltimore had, the guarding against the exertions of prerogative, which expe∣rience had taught both were very incon∣venient. The attorney general declared the clause of exemption from taxation il∣legal; and chief justice North being of the same opinion, and observing its tend∣ency, added the saving of the authority of the English parliament; so that it was stipulated by the king, for himself and his successors, that "no custom or other con∣tribution shall be laid on the inhabitants or their estates, unless by the consent of the proprietary, or governor and assembly, or by act of parliament in England."</P>
<P>The next year, 1681, the patent was granted, in consideration of "the merits of the father, and the good purposes of the son, in order to extend the English empire, and to promote useful commo∣dities." It was provided by fit clauses, that the sovereignty of the king should be pre∣served, and that acts of parliament, con∣cerning trade, navigation, and the customs, be duly observed. Penn was empowered to assemble the freemen, or their delegates,
<PB N="44" REF="025347_0042_0FCCFF2840D60CE0"/>in such form as he shall think proper for raising money for the use of the colony, and for making useful laws, not contrary to those of England, or the rights of the kingdom. A duplicate of the acts of the assembly was to be transmitted, within five years, to the king in council, and the acts might be de∣clared void within six months if not approved —It now remains only to give a concise account of the settlement of Georgia.</P>
<P>In 1732, a number of gentlemen con∣sidering the vast benefit that might arise from the tract of land, lying between the Savannah and the river Alatamaha, peti∣tioned the king for a charter, which was accordingly granted in June. They meant that the country should be made a bulwark for the southern colonies against the Span∣iards, and should give employment to num∣bers of people, who were burthensome at home to their friends and parishes.</P>
<P>Towards the end of August, Sir Gil∣bert Heathcote recommended, in the strongest terms, to the directors of the Bank, the interest of the colony. His speech had the desired effect, and the mem∣bers of the court, after his example, con∣tributed largely towards the undertaking, as did great numbers of the nobility, gen∣try, clergy and others; and the parliament granted 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> By the beginning of
<PB N="45" REF="025347_0043_0FCCFF2B37E46D08" MS="y"/>November, about one hundred and sixteen colonists presented themselves, most of them labouring people, and were furnished with working tools of all kinds, stores, and small arms.</P>
<P>Mr. Oglethorpe, one of the trustees, generously attended the first set of emi∣grants to Carolina, where they arrived in good health in, January 1733. The Ca∣rolinians made them a present of one hundred breeding cattle, besides hogs, and twenty barrels of rice, and furnished them with a party of horse, and with scout boats, by the help of which they reached the Savannah, where Mr. Oglethorpe, ten miles up the river, pitched upon a spot for a town, and in February the building of the first house commenced.</P>
<P>Mr. Oglethorpe was waited upon by a numerous deputation from the lower Creek nation, with whom he concluded a treaty, and soon after set out for Charles-town on his return to England, bringing with him several chiefs and a war captain. Before the end of March, 1734, more emigrants, to the amount of six hundred, were either sent over by charity, or went at their own expence.</P>
<P>In October, the Indians embarked for their own country, having had an allow∣ance, while in London, of twenty pounds
<PB N="46" REF="025347_0044_0FCCFF2C867361E8"/>a week, of which they spent little, as they commonly eat-and drank at the table of persons of the highest distinction. They embarked at Grave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end, in a ship which carried over a number of Salez burghers, being German protestants, who, with others of their countrymen that followed, settled on the Savannah, a town they called Ebe∣nezer, and which, by their habits of in∣dustry and sobriety soon became consider∣able.</P>
<P>The Georgians made a surprising pro∣gress in clearing their lands, and building their houses, and as an encouragement, the British parliament granted them a sup∣ply of 26,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which, with very great private donations. were expended upon strengthening the southern part of Georgia.</P>
<P>Thus have we given a succinct account of the first establishment of the British colonies in North America. By what unhappy means they at last became sepe∣rated from the mother country. will be clearly shown in the subsequent part of this history.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE narrow limits prescribed to us in this epitome, will not permit us to enter into a copious detail of all the mi∣nute concerns of the colonies, which may be found in more voluminous works, and there read by those, who have leisure and inclination to pursue so dry a study. We shall therefore proceed to describe only events of some consequence.</P>
<P>News being received in the Massachu∣setts of war being declared against France and Spain, the general court, then sitting, made immediate provision for raising forces for Anapolis in Nova Scotia.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="025347_0046_0FCCFF32C04B1A90"/>
Towards the end of the month of April, 174<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Commodore Warren arrived from the West Indies, with a sixty gun ship, and two of forty. He was soon after joined by another of forty, which had reached Canso a short time before. The men of war failed immediately to cruise before Louisbourg. The forces soon fol∣lowed, and landed at Chapeaurouge Bay the last day of April. The transports were discovered from the town early in the morning, which gave the inhabitants the first knowledge of the design.</P>
<P>The second day after landing, four hund∣red men marched round, behind the hills, to the northeast harbour, where they got about midnight, and set fire to all the dwellings and storehouses, till they came within a mile of the grand battery. The clouds of thick smoke proceeding from the pitch, tar, and other combustibles, prevented the garrison's discovering the enemy, though they were but at a short distance.</P>
<P>They expected the body of the army upon them, and therefore deserted the fort, having thrown their powder into a well; but the cannon and shot were left, which proved of great service to the besiegers. The army had near two miles to transport their cannon, mortars, &amp;c. through a mo∣rass,
<PB N="49" REF="025347_0047_0FCCFF3452A5DD60"/>which required great labour to accom∣plish. The men were yoked together, and during the night made great advances.</P>
<P>While the forces were busily employed on shore, the men of war, and other vessels were cruising off the habour, as often as the weather would permit. On the 18th of May, they captured a french 44 gun ship, having 560 men on board, and stores of all forts for the garrison.</P>
<P>It was given out, that an attack would be made by sea with the ships, on the 18th, while the army did the like by land. Whe∣ther a general storm was really intended or not, the French appeared to expect it, from the preparations making on board the men of war, and seemed not inclined to attempt to withstand it.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth, a flag of truce was sent to the general, desiring a cessation of hos∣tilities, that they might consider of articles for a capitulation. Time was allowed, but their articles were rejected by the general and commodore, and others offered, which were accepted by the French, and hostages given on both sides. The town was in con∣sequence delivered up on the seventeenth. As this was a time when vessels were ex∣pected from all parts at Louisbourg, the French flag was kept flying as a decoy. Two East Indiamen, and one South-sea ship, of the value of 600,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling, were taken
<PB N="50" REF="025347_0048_0FCCFF35890DB020"/>by the squadron, at the mouth of the har∣bour, into which they failed as usual, not knowing that the place had been taken by the English.</P>
<P>The French having been very troublesome in the back settlements of our colonies, it was concluded to take effectual methods to drive them from the Ohio. The reduction of Niagara, Crown Point, and their forts in Nova Scotia, was also resolved on. General Braddock was accordingly sent from Ireland to Virginia, with two regiments of foot; and on his arrival, when joined by the rest of the forces destined for that service, he found himself at the head of 2200 men. He had bravery, but wanted other qualifications to render him fit for the service to which he was appointed. The severity or his discipline made him unpopular among the regulars, and his haughtiness deprived him of the esteem of the Americans. His pride disgusted the indians, and led him to despise the country militia, and to slight the advice of the Virginian officers.</P>
<P>Colonel Washington earnestly begged of him, when the army was marching for fort Du Quesne, to admit of his going before, and scouring the woods with his rangers, which was contemptuously refused. The general had been cautioned by the Duke of Cumberland to guard against a surprise, and yet he pushed on heedlessly with the first di∣vision, consisting of 1400 men, till he fell
<PB N="51" REF="025347_0049_0FCCFF37012A3F90"/>into an ambuscade of 400, chiefly indians, by whom he was defeated and mortally wounded, on the 9th of July, 1755.</P>
<P>The regulars were put into the greatest panic, and fled in the utmost confusion; but the militia had been used to indian fighting, and were not so terrified. The general had disdainfully turned them into the rear, where they continued in a body unbroken, and served under Colonel Washington as a most useful rear guard, which covered the retreat of the regulars, and prevented their being entirely cut to pieces.</P>
<P>Previous to this and agreeable to the views of the British ministry, the Massachusetts assembly raised a body of troops, which were sent to Nova Scotia, to assist Lieutenant Go∣vernor Lawrence in driving the French from their several encroachments within that pro∣vince.</P>
<P>The expedition against Niagara was en∣trusted to Governor Shirley, but failed thro' various causes.</P>
<P>Sir William, then Colonel, Johnson, was appointed to go against Crown Point. The delays, slowness, and deficiency of prepara∣tion, prevented the several colonies joining their troops till about August. In the mean time the active enemy had transported forces from France to Canada, marched them down to meet the provincials, and attacked them; but, meeting with a repulse, lost six hundred
<PB N="52" REF="025347_0050_0FCCFF38A4A7D9A0"/>men, besides having their general Baron Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>skau wounded and made prisoner.</P>
<P>The next year, the Massachusetts raised a great armament to go against Crown Point; but Lord London, on his arrival, did not think it proper that the forces should proceed, owing to a temporary misunderstanding be∣tween his Lordship and the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>In the year 1758, happily for the British nation, the great Mr. Pitt was placed at the head of the ministry, when the face of affairs was soon changed, the war was prosecuted with unexampled success, and the enemy was at length driven out of America.</P>
<P>Mr. Israel Mauduit, the Massachusetts a∣gent, in 1763, gave early notice of the minis∣terial intentions to tax the colonies; but the general court not being called together till the latter end of the year, instructions to the agent, though solicited by him, could not be sent in proper time.</P>
<P>The next year however, 1764, the house of representatives came to the following re∣solutions: "That the sole right of giving and granting the money of the people of that province, was vested in them as their legal representatives; and that the imposition of duties and taxes by the parliament of Great Britain, upon a people who are not repre∣sented in the House of Commons, is abso∣lutely irreconcileable with their rights."—"That no man can justly take the property
<PB N="53" REF="025347_0051_0FCCFF3C684900E8"/>of another without his consent; upon which original principle, the right of representation in the same body, which exercises the power of making laws for levying taxes, one of the main pillars of the British constitution, is evidently founded."</P>
<P>These resolutions were occasioned by in∣telligence of what had been done in the Bri∣tish House of Commons. It had been there debated in March, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther they had a <HI>right</HI> to tax the Americans, they not being repre∣sented; and determined unanimously in the affirmative. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a single person present ven∣tured to controvert the <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>After various propositions for taxing the colonies, Mr. Grenville's intended stamp act was communicated to the American agents. Many of them did not oppose it, half their number being placemen or depo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> on the ministry. Mr. Joseph Sherwood, an honest quaker, agent for Rhode Island, refused his consent to America's being taxed by a Bri∣tish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment. Mr. Mauduit, the Massa∣chusetts agent, favoured the raising of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> money by a stamp duty, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would occasion less expence of officers, and would include the Wesundia islands. The scheme, however was postponed, and the ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts au∣thorised to inform the American a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>blies, that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t liberty to suggest any other ways of raising monies, and that Mr. Gren∣ville, was ready to receive proposals for any
<PB N="54" REF="025347_0052_0FCCFF3DC59DBE80"/>other tax, that might be equivalent in its produce to the stamp tax. The colonies seemed to consider it as an affront, rather than as a compliment. The minister would not be content with any thing short of a cer∣tain specific sum, and proper funds for the payment of it. Had not the sums been an∣swerable to his wishes, he would have reject∣ed them; and he would scarcely have been satisfied with less than 300,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum, which was judged absolutely necessary to de∣fray the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e expence of the army proposed for the defence of America.</P>
<P>No satisfactory proposals being made on the side of the Americans, Mr. Grenville adhered to his purpose of bringing forward the stamp bill, though repeatedly pressed by some of his friends to desist. Richard Jack∣son, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> had been chosen agent for the Massachusetts, who, with Mr. Franklin and other, lately come from Philadelphia, waited on Mr. Grenville, in February 176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to re∣monstrate against the stamp bill and to pro∣pose, that in case any tax must be laid upon America, the several colonies might be per∣mited to lay the tax themselves. Mr. Gren∣ville, however, adhered to his own opinions, and said that he had pledged his word for of∣fering the stamp bill to the house, and that the house would hear their objections.</P>
<P>The bill was accordingly brought in, and in March, the same year, received the royal
<PB N="55" REF="025347_0053_0FCCFF4074FD4EC0" MS="y"/>assent. The framers of the stamp-act flat∣tered themselves, that the confusion which would arise from the disuse of writings, would compel the colonies to use stamp paper, and therefore to pay the taxes imposed. Thus they were led to pronounce it to be a law which would execute itself.</P>
<P>Mr. Grenville, however, was not without his apprehensions that it might occasion dis∣order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to prevent or suppress which he pro∣jected another bill, which was brought in the same sessions, whereby it was made lawful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> military officers in the colonies to quarter their soldiers in private houses. This seemed intended to awe the people into a compliance with the other act. Great opposition being made to it, as under such a power in the army, no one could look on his house as his own, that part of the bill, was dropt; but there still remained a clause when it passed into a law, to oblige the several assemblies to provide quarters for the soldiers, and to furnish them with firing, bedding, candles, small beer, rum, and sundry other articles, at the expence of the several provinces. This clause continu∣ed in force after the stamp act was re∣pealed.</P>
<P>These proceedings of the mother country gave rise to great disturbances in America. Some persons of consequence at Boston, to manifest their abhorrence and detestation of a party in England, who they supposed were
<PB N="56" REF="025347_0054_0FCCFF41A208A580"/>endeavoring to subvert the British constitu∣tion, to enslave the colonies, and to alienate the affections of his majesty's most faithful subjects in America, early in the morning of the 14th of August, hung upon the limb of a large dead elm, near the entrance of Boston, in one of the most public streets, two essigies. One of them, as appeared by the labels af∣fixed thereto, was intended to represent the stamp officer; the other was a jack-boot, with a head and horns peeping out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p.</P>
<P>The report of this novelty drew great numbers from every part of the town and the neighboring country. This affair was left to take its own course, so that an enthusiastic spirit diffused itself into the minds of the spectators. In the evening, the figures were cut down, and carried in funeral procession, the populace shouting, <HI>Liberty and property forever! No stamps, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They then went to a new building, erected by Mr. Oliver, which they pulled down, falsely supposing it to be designed for the stamp-office. As soon as they approached Mr. Oliver's house, they beheaded the essigy, at the same time breaking all his windows, and demolished his gardens, fences, barns, and every thing else that came in their way.</P>
<P>The next day, Mr. Oliver, fearful of what might happen, declared that he had written to England and resigned. The mob assem∣bled
<PB N="57" REF="025347_0055_0FCCFF4413EFE1C0"/>again at night; and after some expres∣sions of joy for the resignation, proceeded to the lieutenant governor's, Mr. Hutchinson's house, which they besieged for an hour, but in vain; insisting repeatedly upon knowing, whether he had not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n favor of the stamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act.</P>
<P>These disorders grew ever day more enor∣mous and alarming. Mobs once raised soon become ungovernable by new and large ac∣cessions, and extend t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir intentions far be∣yond those of the original instigators. Crafty men may intermix with them, when they are much heated, and direct their operations very differently from what was at first designed.</P>
<P>People in England were differently affected by the disturbances in the colonies. Some were for supporting the authority of parlia∣ment at all events, and for enforcing the stamp act, if needful, with the point of the sword; while others were for quieting the colonies by the repeal of it. Happily for them, Mr. Grenville and his party were thrown out of place, and were succeeded by the Marquis of Rockingham, when, on the 22d of February, 1766, this obnoxious act was repealed.</P>
<P>In May, 1767, Mr. Charles Townsend, then chancellor of the Exchequer, moved the House of Commons for leave to bring in bills for granting a duty upon paper, glass, painters colours, &amp;c. in the British American colo∣nies;
<PB N="58" REF="025347_0056_0FCCFF46486DCE70" MS="y"/>for settling salaries on the governors, judges, &amp;c. in North America; and for tak∣ing off the duties on teas exported to Amer∣ica, and granting a duty of three pence a pound on the importation in America. Two bills were at length framed, and in June and July received the royal assent.</P>
<P>These acts occasioned fresh, disturbances in America, where matters were carried to a much greater height than bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. In con∣sequence of this, Lord Hillsborough wrote to General Gage, in June, 1768, to send troops to Boston, in order to preserve the peace of that town.</P>
<P>The introduction of troops into Boston was attended with very serious consequences. The inhabitants became exceedingly riotous. and some of the rabble pushed their ill con∣duct so far, as to oblige the soldiers to fire on them, in their own defence. This happened on the 5th of March, 1770, when three per∣sons were killed, five dangerously wounded, and a few slightly.</P>
<P>This was far from removing the evil, and only tended to widen the breach. Under the notion of zeal for liberty, the rabble ran into the most excessive licentiousness, and were every where guilty of the most lawless, un∣just, and tyrannical proceedings, pulling down houses, destroying the property of every one that had fallen under their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spleasure,
<PB N="59" REF="025347_0057_0FCCFF47C0883330"/>and delivering prisoners out of the hands of justice.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our attention to see what was doing, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mean time at home. The supporting the authority of parliament, was the only cause assigned by the minister him∣self for retaining the tea duty at the very time when he acknowledged it to be as anti∣commercial a tax, as any of those that had been repealed upon that principle.</P>
<P>The East India company, feeling the bad effects of the colonial smuggling trade in the large quantities of tea, which remained in their warehouses unsold, requested the repeal of the three-pence per pound in America, and offered, that on its being complied with, government should retain six-pence in the pound on the exportation. Thus the compa∣ny presented the happiest opportunity that could have been offered for honorably remov∣ing the cause of difference with America. This afforded an opening for doing justice, without infringing the claims on either side. The minister was requested and intreated, by a gentleman of great weight in the com∣pany, and a member of parliament, to em∣brace the oportunity; but it was obstinately rejected.</P>
<P>New contrivances were set on foot to intro∣duce the tea, attended with the three penny d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, into all the colonies. Various intrigues and solicitations were used to induce the East-India
<PB N="60" REF="025347_0058_0FCCFF4B6BC206C0"/>company to undertake this rash and foolish business. It was protested against as contrary to the principle of the company's monopol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power of the ministry prevailed, and the insignificant three-penny duty on tea was doomed to be the fatal bone of contention between Great Britain and her colonies. The company at last adopted the system, and became their own factors. They sent 600 chests of tea to Philadelphia, the like quantity to New York and Boston, be∣sides what was consigned to other places. Several ships were also freighted for different colonies, and agents appointed for the disposal of the commodity.</P>
<P>In the mean time the colonists, who well knew what had passed in the mother country, were concerting measures to counteract the views of the British ministry Soon after the arrival of the tea ships at Boston, a num∣ber of persons, chiefly masters of vessels, and ship bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lders from the north end of the town, about seventeen in number, dressed as In∣dians, went on board the ships, and in about two hours hoisted out of them, and broke open 342 chests of tea the contents of which they emptied into the sea. They were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the least molested; for the multitude of spectators on the wharf served as a covering party. The whole business was conducted with very little tumult, and no damage was done to the vessels or any other property.

</FIGURE>
<PB N="61" REF="025347_0060_0FCCFF4F0F78E060"/>When the business was finished, the people returned quietly to their own towns and hab∣itations.</P>
<P>These and other decisive proceedings of the Bostonians, induced the British ministry to bring in a bill into parliament, "for the immediate removal of the officers concerned in the collection of the customs at Boston, and to discontinue the landing and discharg∣ing, lading and shipping of goods, wares, and merchandizes, at Boston, or within the harbour thereof." On the 31st of March, 1774, the bill received the royal assent.</P>
<P>Other bills were passed by the British par∣liament, brought in by Lord North, all tend∣ing to punish the Americans, and the Bol∣tonians in particular, for their refractory be∣haviour. Petitions were sent over from America, and several of the members of both houses reprobated these severe and dangerous proceedings; but no regard was paid either to the petitions or to the remonstrances of the minority in both houses. The then min∣istry, at the head of which was Lord North, were determined to accept from the Ameri∣cans of nothing short of absolute and impli∣cit obedience to the laws of taxation. On the other hand, the people of Massachusetts Bay, supported and spurred on by the other colo∣nies, were determined not to submit, and pre∣pared to repel force by force. They col∣lected
<PB N="62" REF="025347_0061_0FCCFF50D9AF9B78" MS="y"/>all the arms they could, and spent much of their time in the exercise of them.</P>
<P>These proceedings of the people, and their manifest disposition to resistance, alarmed the general, who thought it necessary, for the safety of the troops, as well as to secure the important post of Boston, to fortify the en∣trance at the neck, which afforded the only communication, except by water, between the town and the continent.</P>
<P>In England, petitions were presented from the merchants of London, and almost all the trading towns in the kingdom; and Mr. Bol∣lan, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Lee, also pre∣sented petitions from the American congress; but government treated them with indifference and contempt.</P>
<P>Lord Chatham persevered in the prosecu∣tion of his conciliatory scheme with Ame∣rica, and accordingly brought into the house of Lords the outlines of a bill, which he hoped would answer that salutary purpose; but the ministry rejected it. At the same time, Lord North gave a sketch of the mea∣sures he intended to pursue, which were to send a greater force to America, and to bring in a temporary act, to put a stop to all the foreign trade of the different colonies of New∣England, particularly their fishery on the banks of Newfoundland, till they returned to their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="025347_0062_0FCCFF5216A3B720"/>
While matters were thus going on at home, General Gage, at Boston, received intelligence that cannon and carriages were deposited in the neighborhood of Salem. He accordingly sent a body of troops from the castle to seize them, but the Americans found time to out them away, and the troops returned without effecting any thing.</P>
<P>A skirmish having happened at Lexington, between the king's troops and a party of the militia, General Gage no sooner received this intelligence than he detached Lord Piercy to Concord, with sixteen companies of foot, and a number of marines, 900 men in the whole, and two pieces of cannon, to support Colonel Smith.</P>
<P>The junction of the Brigade under Lord Perey, with the detachment under Colonel Smith, gave the last a breathing time, espe∣cially as they now had cannon, which awed the provincials from pressing upon the rear in a direct line; but the whole force did not venture to halt long, as the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te men and militia were every where collecting, in order to cut off their retreat to Boston. They soon renewed their march, constant skirmishing succeeded, and a continual sire, though of∣ten irregular and scattering on their side, as well as on the part of the provincials. The close fiting from behind the walls, by good marksmen, for such were almost all the province <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put the troops into no small
<PB N="64" REF="025347_0063_0FCCFF544FF4DE90"/>confusion, and made it so dangerous for the officers, that they were more attentive to their safety than common. The regulars, when near Cambridge, were upon the point of taking a wrong road, which would have led them into the most eminent danger; but were prevented by the direction of a young gentleman residing at the college. They made good their retreat a little after sun-set, over Charlestown neck to Bunker's hill, but spent and worn down by the excessive fatigues they had undergone, having march∣ed that day between thirty and forty miles. Here they remained secure till the next day, when they crossed at Charlestown ferry, and returned to Boston. In this skirmish, the regulars had 65 killed, 180 wounded, and 28 made prisoners. The provincials had 50 men killed, 34 wounded, and four missing.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the mother country, where the restraining and fishery bill met with great opposition in both houses of par∣liament. The fishery bill had scarcely cleared the House of Commons, when Lord North brought in another to restrain the trade and commerce of the colonies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, to Great Britain, Ireland, and the British islands in the West Indies, under cer∣tain conditions and limitations.</P>
<P>The British ministry did not confine them∣selves to the making of laws; but they also
<PB N="65" REF="025347_0064_0FCCFF566FEC9DA0"/>sent out against the Americans the Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, who left Eng∣land on the 28th of May, and in about a week afterwards, transports laden with troops sailed from Cork, to reinforce General Gage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE necessity of securing Ticonderoga was early attended to by many in New England. General Gage had set the exam∣ple of attempting to seize upon military stores, and by so doing had commenced hostilities, so that retaliation appeared warrantable.</P>
<P>Colonel Allen was at Castleton, with about 270 men, 230 of which were <HI>Green Moun∣tain Boys,</HI> so called from their residing with∣in the limits of the Green Mountains, the Hampshire Grants being so denominated from the range of green mountains that run through them. Sentinels were placed im∣mediately on all the roads to prevent any in∣telligence being carried to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Colonel Arnold, who now joined Colonel Allen, reported, that there were at Ticon∣deroga, 80 pieces of heavy cannon, 20 of brass, from four to eighteen pounders, ten or a dozen mortars, a number of small arms, and considerable stores; that the fort was in a ruinous condition, and, as he supposed, garrisoned by about forty men. It was then settled, that Colonel Allen should have the supreme command, and Colonel Arnold was to be his assistant.</P>
<P>Colonel Allen with his 230 Green Moun∣tain Boys, arrived at Lake Champlain,
<PB N="67" REF="025347_0066_0FCCFF58B9FA7FB0"/>opposite to Ticonderoga, on the ninth of May, at night. Boats were with difficulty procured, when he and Colonel Arnold crossed over with 83 men, and landed near the garrison The two colonels advanced along side each other, and entered the port, leading to the fort, in the grey of the morn∣ing. A sentry snapped his fusee at Colonel Allen, and then retreated through the cov∣ered way to the parade. The main body of Americans then followed, and drew up. Capt. de la Place, the commander, was sur∣prised in bed. Thus was the place taken without any bloodshed.</P>
<P>On the 15th of June, 1775, the congress proceeded to choose by ballot a general to command all the continental forces, and George Wash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was unanimously elected.</P>
<P>The next day, orders were issued by the Americans, for a detachment of a thousand men, to march at evening, and entrench upon Bunker's hill. By some mistake, Breed's hill, high and large like the other, but situated on the furthest part of a peninsula, next to Bos∣ton, was marked out for the intrenchment in∣stead of Bunker's. The provincials proceed∣ed therefore to Breed's hill; but were prevent∣ed going to work till near twelve o'clock at night, when they pursued their business with utmost diligence and alacrity; so that by the dawn of the day, they had thrown up a
<PB N="68" REF="025347_0067_0FCCFF5CB74FA330"/>small redoubt, about eight rods square. Such was the extraordinary silence that reigned among them, that they were not heard by the British on board their vessels in the neigh∣boring waters. The sight of the works was the first notice that the Lively man of war had of them, when the captain began firing upon them about four in the morning.</P>
<P>The guns called the town of Boston, the camp, and the fleet, to behold a novelty, which was little expected. The prospect obliged the British generals to alter the plan they intended to have pursued the next day. They grew weary of being cooped up in Boston, and had resolved upon making them∣selves masters of Dorchester heights; but the present provincial movement prevented the expedition. They were now called to at∣tempt possessing themselves of Breed's hill, on which the provincials continued working, notwithstanding a heavy fire from the ene∣my's ships, a number of sloating batteries, and a fortification up Cop's hill, in Boston, directly opposite to the little American re∣doubt. An incessant shower of shot and bombs was poured by the batteries upon the American works, and yet but one man was killed.</P>
<P>The Americans continuing laboring inde∣fatigably till they had thrown up a small breast-work, extending from the east side of the redoubt to the bottom of the hill; but
<PB N="69" REF="025347_0068_0FCCFF5EC5804F58"/>they were prevented completing it from the intolerable fire of the enemy. By some un∣accountable error, the detachment, which had been working for hours, was neither re∣lieved, nor supplied with refreshments, but were left to engage under these disadvan∣tages.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one o'clock, and the day exceedingly hot, a number of boats and barges, filled with regular troops from Boston approached Charlestown, when the men were landed at Moreton's Point. They consisted of four battallions, two companies of grena∣diers, and ten of light infantry, with a pro∣portion of field artillery; but, by some over∣sight, their spare cartridges were much too big for them: so that, when the Americans were at length forced from their lines, there was not a round of artillery cartridges re∣maining.</P>
<P>Major Gen. Howe and Brigadier Gen. Pigot had the command. The troops formed, and remained in that position, till joined by a second detachment of light infantry and gre∣nadier companies, a battalion of the land forces, and a batttalion of marines, amount∣ing in the whole to about 3000 men. The Gererals Clinton and Burgoyne took their stand upon Cops-hill, to observe and contem∣place the bloody and destructive operations that were now commencing. The regulars formed in two lines, and advanced delibe∣rately,
<PB N="70" REF="025347_0069_0FCCFF60528155D0"/>frequently halting to give time for the artillery to fire, which was not well served. The light infantry were directed to force the left point of the breast-work, and to take the American line in flank. The grenadiers ad∣vanced to attack in front, supported by two battalions, while the left, under Gen. Pigot inclined to the right of the American line. One or two of the continental regiments had been posted in Charlestown, but afterwards removed to prevent their being cut off by a sudden attack; so that the British were not in the least hurt by the musquetry from thence,</P>
<P>Gen. Gage had for some time resolved upon burning the town, whenever any works were raised by the Americans upon the hills belonging to it: and while the British were advancing nearer to the attack, orders came to Cop's hill for executing the resolution. Soon after a carcass was discharged, which set fire to an old house near the ferry way; the fire instantly spread, and most of the place was soon in flames; while the houses at the eastern end of Charlestown were set on fire by men who landed from the boats.</P>
<P>The regulars derived no advantage from the smoke of the conflagration, for the wind suddenly shifting, carried it another way, so that it could not cover them in their ap∣proach. The provincials had not a rifleman among them, not one being yet arrived from

<PB N="71" REF="025347_0071_0FCCFF63B67A55B8"/>the southward; nor had they any other guns than common muskets, and even those were not furnished with bayonets. However, they were almost all marksmen, being accustomed to sporting of one kind or other from their youth. A number of Massachusetts people were in the redoubt, and the part of the breast-work nearest it. The left of the breast-work, and the open ground stretching beyond its point to the water-side, through which there was not an opportunity of carry∣ing the work, was occupied partly by the Massachusetts forces, and partly by the peo∣ple of Connecticut.</P>
<P>The British moved on slowly to the at∣tack, instead of using a quick step; which gave the provincials the advantage of taking surer and cooler aim. These reserved their fire, till the regulars came within ten or twelve rods, when they began a furious dis∣charge of small arms, which stopped the re∣gulars, who kept up the firing without ad∣vancing. The discharge from the Americans was so incessant, and did such execution, that the regulars retreated in disorder, and with great precepitation towards the place of landing. Their officers used every effort to make them return to the charge, with which they at length complied; but the Americans again reserved their fire till the regulars came within five or six rods, when the enemy was a second time put to flight.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="025347_0072_0FCCFF64BB15AFC8"/>
General Howe and the officers redoubled their exertions; and General Clinton, per∣ceiving how the army was staggered, passed over, without waiting for orders, and joined them in time to be of service. The Ameri∣cans being in want of powder, sent for a supply but could procure none; for there was but a barrel and a half in the magazine. This deficiency disabled them from making the same defence as before; while the Bri∣tish reaped a further advantage by bringing some cannon to bear, so as to rake the inside of the breast work from end to end. The regular army now made a decisive push, and the fire from the ships and batteries was re∣doubled. The provincials were of necessity ordered to retreat.</P>
<P>It was feared by the Americans, that the British troops would push the advantage they had gained, and march immediately to the head quarters at Cambridge, about two miles distant, and in no state of defence. But they advanced no farther than to Bunker's<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hill, where they threw up works for their own security. The provincials did the same upon Prospect-hill, in front of them, about half way to Cambridge.</P>
<P>The loss of the British according to Ge∣neral Gage, amounted to 1054, of whom 226 were killed; of these 19 were commissioned officers, including a lieutenant colonel, two majors, and seven captains. Seventy other
<PB N="73" REF="025347_0073_0FCCFF67DB87E5B8"/>officers were wounded. Among those more generally regretted, were Lieutenant Colonet Abercromby, and Major Pitcairn.</P>
<P>The provincials had 139 killed, 278 wounded, and 36 were missing, in all 453.</P>
<P>In the opinion of many, General Howe was chargeable with a capital error in land∣ing and attacking as he did. It might ori∣ginate from too great a confidence in the forces he commanded, and in too contemp∣tuous an opinion of the enemy he had to en∣counter. He certainly might have entrapped the provincials, by landing on the narrowest part of Charleston neck, under the fire of the floating batteries and ships of war. Here he might have stationed and fortified his army, and kept up an open communication with Boston by a water carriage, which he would have commanded through the aid of the navy, on each side of the peninsula. Had he made this manae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vre, the provincials must have made a rapid retreat from Breed's hill, to escape having his troops in the rear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd being enclosed. It was said that General Clinton proposed it. The rejection of that proposal greatly weakened the British army, and probably prevented the ruin of the A∣mericans.</P>
<P>In July, the congress received a letter from the convention of Georgia, setting forth, that the colony had acceded to the general
<PB N="74" REF="025347_0074_0FCCFF6947FE10F8"/>association, and appointed delegates to attend the congress.</P>
<P>The accession of Georgia to the colonies occasioned their being afterwards called <HI>The Thirteen United Colonies.</HI> The first hostilities that happened in this part between the oppo∣site parties, commenced about the middle of November, when a number of royalists at∣tacked the Americans, and obliged them, after three days, to surrender a fort they had taken possession of, in which they expected to make an effectual resistance.</P>
<P>In the month of November, the New-York convention having resolved upon the removal of the cannon from the battery of the city, Captain Sears was appointed to the business. Captain Vandeput, of the Asia man of war, was privately informed of the design, and prepared to oppose its execution. Learning when it was to be attempted, he appointed a boat to watch the motion of the people assembled for the purpose about the dead of night. The sailors in the boat giv∣ing the signal, with a flash of powder, of what was going forwards, the persons on shore mistook it for an attempt to fire a mus∣ket at them, and immediately aimed a volly of shot at the boat, by which a man was killed. Captain Vandeput soon after com∣menced a firing from the Asia with grape shot, swivel shot, 18 and 24 pounders, with∣out killing a single person, and wounded
<PB N="75" REF="025347_0075_0FCCFF6B77FDD4F0"/>only three, two slightly, the other lost the calf of his leg. He then ceased for a con∣siderable time, supposing that the people had desisted from their purpose, while they were only changing their mode of operation.</P>
<P>Capt. Sears provided a deceiving party, intended to draw the Asia's fire from the line of the working party. He sent the former behind a breast-work, by which they were secured by dodging down upon observing the flash of the Asia's guns. When all was in readiness, they huzzaed, and sung out their notes as though rugging in unison, and fired from the walls; while the working party si∣lently got off twenty-one eighteen pounders, with carriages, empty cartridges, rammers, &amp;c</P>
<P>Upon hearing the noise and seeing the fire of the musketry the captain ordered the Asia to fire a whole broadside towards that part of the fort, where the deceiving party had secured themselves, without intending any particular injury to the city. However some of the shot flew into the city, and did damage.</P>
<P>This affair happened at a very late hour, between twelve and two, and threw the cit∣izens into the utmost consternation. The distress of the New Yorkers was very much encreased by a painful apprehension, that Capt. Vandeput would renew his firing upon the city. A removal of men, women, chil∣dren,
<PB N="76" REF="025347_0076_0FCCFF6D219D4920"/>and goods instantly commenced, and continued for some time. Matters were however so far adjusted, as to quiet the appre∣hensions of the people, in reference to their suffering further from the fire of the Asia. To prevent it, the convention permitted Abraham Lott <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to supply his majesty's ships, stationed at Newyork, with all necessa∣ries, as well fresh as salted, for the use of those ships.</P>
<P>In the month of November, the general assembly of Rhode-Island passed an act for the capital punishment of persons, who should be found guilty of holding a traiterous cor∣respondence with the ministry of Great Bri∣tain, or any of their officers or agents, or of supplying the ministerial army or navy, employed against the United Colonies, with provisions, arms, &amp;c. or of acting as pilots on board any of their vessels. They also passed an act for sequestering the estates of several persons, whom they considered as a∣vowed enemies to the liberties of America.</P>
<P>On the night of the 26th of August, about 2000 American troops entrenched on Plow∣ed hill, within point blank shot of the Bri∣tish on Bunker's hill; and nothwithstanding a continual fire almost all the day following, they had only two killed and two wounded. The British finding that their firing did not answer, relaxed, and ofter a while desisted
<PB N="77" REF="025347_0077_0FCCFF6F2807E108"/>entirely, and the Americans remained quiet in their new post.</P>
<P>In the beginning of September, General Washington received a very acceptable re∣mittance of 7000 pounds weight of powder, which had been very scarce in the American army.</P>
<P>Gen. Washington, having received pleas∣ing accounts from Canada, being assured that neither Indians nor Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ians could be prevailed upon to act agai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Americans, concerted the plan of detaching a body of troops from the head quarters, across the country to Quebec. He communicated the same to Gen. Schuyler, who approved it, and all things were got in readiness. They set out on the expedition on the 13th of Sep∣tember, under the command of Col. Arnold, assisted by the Colonels Green and Enos, and Majors Megis and Bigelow, the whole force amounting to about eleven hundred men.</P>
<P>On the 18th of October, Capt. Morvat destroyed 139 houses, 278 stores and other buildings, the far greater and better part of the town of Falmouth, in the northern part of Massachusetts. The inhabitants in com∣pliance with a resolve of the provincial congress, to prevent tories carrying out their effects, gave some violent obstruction to the loading of a mast ship, which drew upon them the indignation of the British admiral.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="025347_0078_0FCCFF70024EE970"/>
In the mean time, Gen. Montgomery was sent forward to Ticonderoga, with a body of troops; and being arrived at the Isle aux Noix, he drew up a declaration, which he sent among the Canadians by Col. Allen and Major Brown, assuring them, that the army was designed only against the English garisons, and not against the country, their liberties, or religion.</P>
<P>Col. Allen and Major Brown being on their return, after executing the commission, with which the general had entrusted them, the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter advised Col. Allen, to halt, and proposed, that the Colonel should return to Longueil, procure canoes and cross the river St. Lawrence, a little north of Montreal, while he, the major, crossed a little to the south of the town, with near 200 men, as he had boats sufficient. The plan was ap∣proved, and Col. Allen passed the river in the night. The major, by some means, failed on his part, and Col. Allen found him∣self, the next morning, in a critical situation, but concluded on defending himself. Gen. Carleton, learning how weak Colonel Allen was, marched out against him with about forty regulars, together with Canadians, English and Indians, amounting to some hundreds, The colonel defended himself with much. bravery; but being deserted by several, chiefly Canadians, and having had fifteen of his men killed, was under the neces∣sity
<PB N="79" REF="025347_0079_0FCCFF71AFD62F70"/>of surrendering with thirty one effec∣tives and seven wounded. He was directly put in irons.</P>
<P>On the 4th of October, a party of Cana∣dians, who had joined and greatly assisted the besiegers, entrenched themselves on the east side of the lake, on which the enemy sent an armed sloop with troops to drive them away; but the Canadians attacked the sloop with vigour, killed a number of the men, and obliged her to return to St. John's in a shattered condition.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the main body of the army decamped from the south, and marched to the north side of the fort. In the evening, they began to throw up a breast work, in or∣der to erect a battery of cannon and mortars. The continental troops brought such a spirit of liberty into the field, and thought so free∣ly for themselves, that they would not bear ei∣ther subordination or discipline. The gene∣rals could not, in truth, direct their opera∣tions, and would not have stayed an hour at their head, had they not feared that the exam∣ple would be too generally followed, and so have injured the public service. There was a great want of powder, which, with the disorderly behaviour of the troops, was a damp to the hope of terminating the siege successfully. The prospect, however, soon brightened, for the Americans planned an at∣tack upon Chambleé, and in batteaus carried
<PB N="80" REF="025347_0080_0FCCDB8088D19180"/>down the artillery, past the fort of St. John's. After a short demur, it surrender∣ed to the majors Brown and Livingston. The greatest acquisition was about six tons of powder, which gave great encouragement to the provincials.</P>
<P>On the 12th of November, Gen. Mont∣gomery pressed on to Montreal, which, not being capable of making any defence, Gov. Carleton quitted it one day, and the Ameri∣can general entered it the next.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the advanced season of the year, Gen. Montgomery marched on for the capital, and on the 5th of December appeared before Quebec. The garrison con∣sisted of about fifteen hundred, while the besiegers were said to consist of little more than half that number. Upon his appear∣ing before the city, he sent forward a flag of truce, which was fired upon by order of Sir Guy Carleton. At this Gen. Montgomery was so provoked, that the next day he wrote to Sir Guy, and in his letter, departed from the common mode of conveying his senti∣ments; he made use of threats and language which in his cooler moments he would have declined.</P>
<P>In spite of the inclemency of the season, he set about erecting works. His batteries were composed of snow and water, which soon became solid ice. He planted on them five pieces of ordnance, twelve and nine
<PB N="81" REF="025347_0081_0FCCFF75F906BD58"/>pounders, with one howitzer; but the artil∣lery was inadequate, and made no impression.</P>
<P>In the evening, a council was held by all the commanding officers of Col. Arnold's detachment, and a large majority were for storming the garrison, as soon as the men were provided with bayonets, spears, hatchets and hand grenades. The plan of storming the garrison was wholly the work of General Montgomery, who, in the council of war held on the occasion, shewed the necessity. practicability, and importance of it, in such a clear and convincing manner, that they unani∣mously agreed to the measure. The attempt had the appearance of rashness; but the ge∣neral was persuaded that men, who had be∣haved so bravely, would follow him, and that Sir Gay Carleton's forces would not fight, when actual service commenced.</P>
<P>On the 31st of December, the troops as∣sembled at the hour appointed. They were to make the attack by the way of Cape Dia∣mond, at the general's quarters on the heights of Abraham, and were headed by the Gen. himself. Col. Arnold was made to attack through the suburbs of St. Roe. Col. Living∣ston and Major Brown were to make a false attack upon the walls, to the southward of St. John's gate, and in the mean time to set fire to the gate with the combustibles prepared for that purpose. The colonel was also to give the signals for the combination of the at∣tacks,
<PB N="82" REF="025347_0082_0FCCFF78DE8C9650"/>which were to begin exactly at five o'clock. It is said that Capt. Fraser, of the regulars, who was then on piquet, going his rounds, saw the rockets fired off as signals, and, forming a conjecture of what was going forward, beat to arms without orders, and so prepared the garrison for defence.</P>
<P>The different routes the assailants had to make, the depth of the snow, and other obstacles, prevented the execution of Living∣ston's command. The general moved with his division, attended by a number of carpenters, to the piquets at Cape Diamond. These were soon cut with the saws, and the general pulled them down himself. He then entered, attended by the carpenters and some of his of∣ficers.</P>
<P>On their entrance, their guides forsook them, which alarmed the general and other officers, who were unacquainted with the pass and situation of the enemy's artillery. However, they pressed on, and the general, observing that the troops did not follow with spirit, called out, "Fie, for shame! will the New York troops desert the cause in this cri∣tical moment? Will you not follow when your general leads? Push on, brave boys, Quebec is ours." A few acted with resolu∣tion, advanced, and attacked the guardhouse, when the enemy gave a discharge of grape∣shot from their cannon, and also of small arms, which proved fatal to the general, his
<PB REF="025347_0083_0FCCFF79D0385FD0"/>

<PB N="83" REF="025347_0084_0FCCFF7B37F90A60"/>aide de camp, Capt. Cheeseman, and others. The firing from the guardhouse ceased, by the enemy's quitting their post, and the op∣portunity offered for the assailants to push for∣ward with success; but the Deputy Quarter∣master General, Campbell, with the rank of a Colonel, assumed the command, ordered a retreat, which took place, and the wounded were carried off to the camp.</P>
<P>The division under Col. Arnold was equal∣ly unsuccessful. The Colonel received a wound in one of his legs from a musket ball, and was carried to the general hospital. His men maintained their ground till ten o'clock, when, all hopes of relief being over, they were obliged at last to surrender prisoners of war. In this attack the provincials lost up∣wards of an hundred men. Gen. Mont∣gomery was shot through both his thighs and his head. His body was taken up the next day, an elegant coffin was prepared, and he was soon after decently interred. The gen∣eral was tall and slender, well limbed, of easy, graceful, and manly address. He had the love, esteem, and confidence of the whole army; he was of a good family in Ireland, and had served with reputation in the late war with France. His excellent qualities and disposition procured him an uncommon share of private affection, and his abilities of public esteem. His death was considered as
<PB N="84" REF="025347_0085_0FCCFF825B2280B0"/>a greater loss to the American cause, than all the others with which it was accompanied.</P>
<P>When the continental troops had connect∣ed after the unsuccessful attack on Quebec, there arose a dispute who should command, and whether it was adviseable to raise the siege, or wait till a reinforcement should ar∣rive. A council of war agreed, that Col. Arnold should command, and should continue the siege, or rather the blockade, which was accordingly done, apparently at no small risk, as they had not more than four hundred men fit for duty; but they retired about three miles from the city, and posted themselves advantageously.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now return to Boston and its envi∣rons, and see what was transacting there. On the 15th of February, 1776, the strength of the ice having been tried in one place, and the frost continuing, Gen. Washington was desirous of embracing the season for pas∣sing over it, from Cambridge side into Bos∣ton. He laid before the council of war the following question: "A stroke well aimed at this critical juncture may put a final period to the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and restore peace and tranquility so much to be wished for; and therefore, whether part of Cambridge and Roxborough bays being frozen over, a gen∣eral assault should not be made on Boston?"</P>
<P>Gen. Ward opposed the idea, saying, "The attack must be made with a view of bringing on an engagement, or of driving the enemy out of Boston, and either end will be answered much better by possessing Dor∣chester heights." When the votes were called for, the majority were against the at∣tack. It was however determined to possess themselves of Dorchester heights, which was accordingly afterwards accomplished.</P>
<P>On the 5th of March, the British admiral informed Gen. Howe, that if the Americans possessed those heights, he could not keep
<PB N="86" REF="025347_0087_0FCCFF859856A2F8"/>one of his majesty's ships in the harbour. Every design of Gen. Howe to force the American works on the hill being frustrated, a counsel of war was called, when it was agreed to evacuate the town as soon as possi∣ble. The time that had been gained by the Americans for strengthening their works, took away all hopes of any successful at∣tempts to be made on them by the British forces. The Americans had provided a great number of barrels, filled with stones, gravel and sand, which were placed round the works, ready to be rolled down, with a view to break the lines of any hostile advan∣cing troops, when ascending the hills.</P>
<P>On the 7th of March, there was a gene∣ral hurry and confusion in Boston, every one, in the royal interest, being busy in preparing to quit the town, and to carry off every thing that was valuable. A flag was sent out from the select men, acquainting Gen. Washington with the intention of the troops, and that general Howe was disposed to leave the town standing, provided he could retire uninterrupted. Gen. Washington bound him∣self under no obligation, but expressed him∣self in words, which admitted of a favorable construction; and intimated his good wishes for the preservation of Boston. At four o'clock, in the morning, of the 17th, the embarkation was completed, and before ten the whole fleet was under sail, and the pro∣vincials
<PB N="87" REF="025347_0088_0FCCFF87DFFFD948"/>soon after took possession of the town.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of what was do∣ing in Virginia. Towards the close of 1775 the Liverpool frigate arrived at Norfolk from Great Britain. Soon after, the captain sent a flag of truce, and demanded to be inform∣ed, whether his majesty's ship of war would be supplied from the shore with provi∣sions. The reply was in the negative; and the ships in the harbor being continu∣ally annoyed by the riflemen from behind the buildings and warehouses on the wharfs, it was determined to dislodge them by destroy∣ing the town.</P>
<P>Previous notice was given, that the wo∣men, children, and other innocent persons, might remove from the danger. The en∣trance of the new year was signalized at four o'clock in the morning, by a violent can∣nonade from the Liverpool, two sloops of war, and the governor's armed ship the Dunmore, seconded by parties of sailors and marines, who landed and fired the houses next the water. Where buildings, instead of being covered with tile, slate, or lead, are covered with shingles, (thin light pieces of fir or cedar, half a yard in length, and about six inches broad) let the wind be ever so moderate, they will, upon being fired, be likely to communicate the conflagration to a distance, should the weather be dry, by the
<PB N="88" REF="025347_0089_0FCCFF88CD6E2028"/>burning shingles being driven by the force of the flames to the tops of other houses.</P>
<P>Thus the whole town was reduced to ashes, that the Americans might have no shel∣ter, should they be inclined to establish a post on the spot. A few men were killed and wounded at the burning of Norfolk, the most populous and considerable town for commerce of any in Virginia. It contained about 6000 inhabitants, and many in affluent circumstances. The whole loss was esti∣mated at more than three hundred thousand pounds sterling. However urgent the neces∣sity, it was an odious sight to see the gov∣ernor, Lord Dunmore, a principal actor in burning and destroying the best town in his government. The horrid distresses brought upon numbers of innocent persons, by these operations, must wound the feelings of all who are not hardened by a party spirit.</P>
<P>While matters were thus transacting in America, the ministry at home gave into great expences, to supply the army at Boston with fresh provisions and other articles. Sir Peter Parker and Earl Cornwallis, with the Acteon and Thunder bomb, sailed from Port mouth for Corke, to convoy the troops and transports there to America; but, owing to some delays, the fleet did not sail before the 13th of February. It consisted of forty-three sail, and about 2500 troops.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="025347_0090_0FCCFF8A3B99CC18"/>
On the 14th of March, a fresh attempt was made in the house of lords, to prevent a continuance of hostilities, which so far suc∣ceeded, that in the May following, letters patent, by his majesty's orders, passed under the great seal, constituting Lord Howe and Gen. Howe, to be his majesty's commis∣sioners for restoring peace to the colonies in North America, and for granting pardon to such of his majesty's subjects there, then in rebellion, as should deserve the royal mercy. The same month Commodore Hotham, with all the transports, having the first divis∣ion of Hessians on board, sailed from St. Helen's for North America. But let us re∣turn to Canada, and attend to what was going forward in that quarter.</P>
<P>The blockade of Quebec was continued; but the fears of the Americans were great, as they had no more than 400 men to do duty, while there were upwards of three times the number in the city; they were in daily expectation that the besieged would sally out upon them. At length a small reinforce∣ment arrived, which enabled them to take a little more rest, though the army was again soon reduced by the small pox that broke out among them.</P>
<P>Towards the end of May, several regi∣ments arrived from England, and the British forces in Canada were estimated at about 13,000 men. The general rendezvous was
<PB N="90" REF="025347_0091_0FCCFF8DF4FEB238"/>appointed to be at Three Rivers, half way between Quebec and Montreal. The Amer∣icans now formed a plan to surprise the Bri∣tish troops, and for that purpose marched un∣der cover of the night, on the 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of June, is order to attack them a little before day∣break. Gen. Thompson, who commanded in this expedition, had procured a Canadian guide, who was either ignorant or unfaith∣ful; for, a little before sun rise, he found his forces were out of the proper road. They returned, but losing their way by the side of the river, they were soon in view of some of the enemy's boats, between which and the flanking par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y several balls were exchanged. They then quickened their pace, and con∣tinued advancing in sight of the shipping, with drums beating and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es playing, as they knew they were discovered. The general, judging there was no possibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of passing the ships, without being exposed to all their fire, and yet determining to persist in the expedi∣tion, filed off at a right angle from the river. He meant to take a circuitous route, and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the town on the back side. A bad morass interposed, the troops entered it, and the men were almost mired. About nine o'clock, they came to a cleared spot, formed, and got into some order about ten. They advanced, but before the rear had got off the place of formation, the front received a heavy fire from the enemy, which struck them with
<PB N="91" REF="025347_0092_0FCCFF8F77D843C0"/>terror. The fire was instantly repeated, and though the balls flew over the heads of the troops, without doing any material execu∣tion, they gave way, and crowded back, in the utmost confusion, which left them with∣out a leader, so that every one did as he pleased. They turned their saces up the river and hastened through the swamp as fast as possible. About eleven they began to collect, and soon learned from the Canadians, that the enemy had sent a detachment, with several field-pieces by land, to cut off their retreat, and a party by water to seize their boats. About four they were told, that the enemy had secured the bridge before them, which it was supposed they must pass. They were also convinced that a large body were closely in their rear. Col. Maxwell ordered all who had collected together to halt, call∣ed the officers to him, and said, "What shall we do? Shall we fight those in the front or in the rear? Shall we tamely submit? or shall we turn off into the woods, and each man shift for himself?" The last proposal was preferred, but the enemy was so near, that the rear of the Americans was exposed to another tremendous fire, while going down the hill into the woods, but the halls flew over them without injuring any. The per∣son, who was entrusted with the care of the boats, had removed them in time to a secure place; so that the loss of the Americans,
<PB N="92" REF="025347_0093_0FCCFF90469D67B8"/>which must otherwise have been much great∣er, amounted only to about 200 prisoners.</P>
<P>The troops that escaped began to collect about ten the next day, and by noon were considerably numerous. They got along by degrees, and by sun set the day following ar∣rived opposite Sorel. Gen. Thompson and Col. Irwin, the second in command, with some other officers were taken. The killed and wounded of the king's troops were tri∣fling.</P>
<P>The king's forces having joined at Three Rivers, proceeded by land and water to Sorel, off which the fleet arrived in the evening a few hours after the rear of the Americans had left it. A considerable body was landed, and the command of the column given to Gen.

Sir Guy Carleton's extra∣ordinary precau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion to put nothing to hazard, when not absolutely necessary, gave the Ame∣ricans the opportunity of escaping. Had Burgoyne been instructed to press on with the utmost expedition, great numbers of the provincials must have been made prisoners, and but few would have crofied Lake Cham∣plain. Thus ended the expedition against Quebec.</P>

To return to Boston. The British Com∣modore Banks, omitting to leave cruisers in the bay, afforded an opportunity to the Ame∣rican privateers of taking a number of High∣landers. Three days after his quitting it, the George and Annabella transports entered, after a passage of seven weeks from Scotland, during the course of which they had not an opportunity of speaking with a single vessel, that could give them the smallest information of the British troops having evacuated Bos∣ton. They were attacked in the morning by four privateers with whom they engaged till the evening, when the privateers bore away, and the transports pushed for Boston harbor, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doubting but they should there receive protection, either from a fort or ship of force stationed for the security of British vessels. They stood up for Nantasket road, when an American battery opened upon them, which was the first serious proof they had of the situation of affairs at the port to which they were destined. They were too far embayed to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat, as the wind had died away, and the tide was half expended. The privateers, with which they had been engaged, joined by two others made towards them. They prepared for action; but, by some misfor∣tune, the Annabella got a ground so far a∣stern of the George, that the latter expected but a feeble support from her musketry. About eleven at night, the privateers anchored
<PB N="94" REF="025347_0095_0FCCFF9343CFB158"/>close by, and hailed them to strike the Bri∣tish flag. The mate of the George, and every sailor on board, the captain excepted, refused to fight any longer; but the officers and privates of the seventy first regiment stood to their quarters till all their ammuni∣tion was expended, when they were forced to yield. They had eight privates and a major killed, besides seventeen wounded. The number of Highlanders taken were 267 privates, 48 officers, besides Lieut Col. Campbell.</P>
<P>On the 25th of June, Gen. Howe ar∣rived at Sandy Hook in the Greyhound fri∣gate. He soon received from Gov. Tryon a full account of the state and disposition of the province, as well as of the strength of the Americans. Gen. Washington's army was small, rather below 9000 fit for duty. Of this little army, it was said, at least 2000 where wholly destitute of arms, and nearly as many with arms in such condition as to be rather calculated to discourage than animate the user. On the 2d of July, Gen. Howe's troops took possession of Staten Island.</P>
<P>On the first of July, congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole upon the subject of independence; but neither colonies nor members being unanimous, it was postponed till the next day. On the fourth, they had it under further considera∣tion, when the declaration of independence
<PB N="95" REF="025347_0096_0FCCFF94CDA28250"/>was agreed to and adopted. The title of it was,
<Q>"A declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assem∣bled."</Q></P>
<P>The preamble follows in these words.—"When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands, which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the seperate and equal station, to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind require that they should declare the causes that impel them to the seperation.</P>
<P>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal—that they are endowed by their creator with certain unali∣enable rights, among which are life, liber∣ty and the pursuit of happiness—that to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e these rights, governments are insti∣tuted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed—that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to insti∣tute a new government, laying its foundations upon such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
<PB N="96" REF="025347_0097_0FCD000C877587D8"/>most likely so effect their safety and happi∣ness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established, should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such go∣vernment, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the pa∣tient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity that constrains them to alter their former systems of government.</P>
<P>The declaration proceeds to give a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all hav∣ing in direct object the establishment of and absolute tyranny over those states.</P>
<P>On the 8th of July, at twelve o'clock the declaration of independence was pro∣claimed at the state-house in Philiadelphia, amidst the greatest acclamations. The next day, in consequence of general orders, it was read at the head of each brigade of the continental army at New York, and every where received with loud huzzas, and the utmost demonstrations of joy. The same evening, the equestrian status of the king
<PB N="97" REF="025347_0098_0FCCDB899EBB7A38"/>was laid prostrate on the ground, and the lead of which it was made was doomed to be run into bullets.</P>
<P>On the 14th of August Lord Dunmore quitted Virginia, and joined the British forces. He arrived with Lord Campbell and Sir Peter Parker off Staten Island. His lordship continued on the coasts, and in the rivers of Virginia, till the closeness and filth of the small vessels, in which the fugitives were crowded, together with the heat of the weather, the badness and scarcity of water and provisions, produced a pestilential fever, which made great havock, especially among the negroes, many of whom were swept away. When at length every place was shut against him, and neither water nor provisions were to be obtained, but at the expence of blood, it was found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cessary to burn several of the smaller and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> valuable vessels, to prevent their falling in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e hands of the Ameri∣cans, and to send <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remainder, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣iled friends of gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to seel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shalter in Florida, Bermudas, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> West Indies.</P>

But it was now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o late to bring them back to the obedience of the mother country, since the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aration of independence had been every where solemnly read.</P>
<P>In the month of August, Gen. Howe finding himself sufficiently strong to attempt something resolved on making a descent on Long isl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. The necessary measures being taken by the fleet for covering the descent, the army was landed, without opposition, between two small towns, Utretcht and Gravesend, not far from the Narrows, on the nearest shore to Staten Island.</P>
<P>On this island are several passes through the mountains or hills, which are easily de∣fensible, being very narrow, and the lands high and mountainous on each side. These were the only roads that could be passed from the south side of the hills to the American lines, excepta road leading round the easterly end of the hills to Jamaica. An early at∣tention had been given to the importance of these passes. To the second of them, the small American parties, patroling on the coasts, re∣tired upon the approach of the British boats with the troops. Lord Cornwallis pushed on immediately with the reserve and some other sorces: but finding the Americans in possession of the pass, in compliance with orders he risked no attack.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="025347_0100_0FCCDB8C8D405198"/>
The Americans had on each of the three passes or roads a guard of Soo men; and to the east of them in the wood, Col. Mites was placed with his battalion to guard the road from the south of the hills to Jamaica, and to watch the motion of the enemy on that side, with orders to keep a party con∣stantly reconnoitring to and across the Ja∣maica road. The centinels were so placed as to keep a continual communication be∣tween the three guards on the three roads.</P>
<P>On the 26th of August, Gen. Howe, having fully settled a plan of surprize, Gen, de Heister, with his Hessians, took post at Flatbush in the evening, and composed the centre. About nine o'clock the same night, the principal army, containing much the greater part of the British forces under the commands of Gen. Clinton, Earl Percy, and Lord Cornwallis, marched in order to gain the road leading round the easterly end of the hills to Jamaica, and so to turn the lest of the Americans. Col. Miles whose duty it was to guard this road, suffered the British to march not less than six miles, till they were near two miles in the rear of the guards, before he discovered and gave notice of their approach.</P>
<P>The next day, before day-break, Gen. Clinton arrived within half a mile of the road, when he halted, and settled his disposi∣tion for the attack. One of his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roles fell
<PB N="100" REF="025347_0101_0FCCDB8E493698C8"/>in with a patrol of American officers on horseback who were trepanned and made prisoners. Gen. Sullivan, though in expec∣tation that they would bring him intelligence, neglected sending out a fresh patrol on finding himself disappointed. Clinton, learning from the captured officers, that the americans had not occupied the road, de∣tached a battalion of light infantry to secure it, and advancing with his troops upon the first appearance of day, possessed himself of the heights that commanded the road.</P>
<P>About midnight, the guard, consisting all of New Yorkers and Pennsylvanians, per∣ceiving that there was danger at hand, fled without firing a gun, and carried to Gen. Parsons, who commanded them, the account of the enemy's advancing in great numbers by that road. Gen. Grant's movements were to divert the attention of the Ameri∣cans from the left, where the main attack was to be made by Gen Clinton. By day-light, Gen. Parsons perceived, that the British were got through the wood, and were de∣scending on the north side. He took twenty of his fugitive guard, being all he could collect, and posted them on a height in front of the British, about half a mile distant, which halted their column, and gave time for Lord Sterling to come up with his forces, amounting to about 1500, who possessed
<PB N="101" REF="025347_0102_0FCCFF964C1BDA80" MS="y"/>himself of a hill about two miles from the camp.</P>
<P>The engagement began soon after day∣break, by the Hessians from Flatbush under Gen Heister, and by Gen Grant on the coast; and a warm ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ade, with a brisk fire of small arms, were eagerly supported on both sides for some considerable time. The Americans opposing Gen. Heister were the first who were apprised of the march of the British troops under Gen. Clinton They accordingly retreated in large bodies, and in tolerable order, to recover their camp; but they were soon interrupted by the right wing under Gen. Clinton, who, having halt∣ed and refreshed his forces after passing the heights, continued his march, and getting into the rear of the left of the Americans, about half past eight o'clock, attacked them with his light infantry and light dragoons, while quitting the heights to return to their lines. They were driven back, and again met the Hessians, and thus were they alter∣nately chaced and intercepted. In these desperate circumstances, some of their regi∣ments, overpowered and out numbered as they were, forced their wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the camps through all the dangers with which they were pressed.</P>
<P>The Americans under Lord Stirling, who were engaged with Gen. Grant, behaved with great bravery and resolution; but were
<PB N="102" REF="025347_0103_0FCCFF99961EC010"/>so late in their knowledge of what passed elsewhere, that their retreat was intercepted by some of the British troops, who, besides turning the hills and the American left, had traversed the whole extent of country in their rear. Several broke through the enemy's lines and got into the woods. Gen. Parsons, with a small party, escaped by doing the same; numbers threw themselves in the marsh at Gorvan's Cove, some were drowned, and others perished in the mud. However a con∣siderable body escaped to the lines. The na∣ture of the country, and the variety of the ground, occasioned a continuance and exten∣sion of small engagements, pursuits and slaughter, which lasted for many hours before the scene closed.</P>
<P>The British troops displayed great valour and activity on this occasion. So impetuous was their ardor, that it was with difficulty they could be restrained, by Gen. Howe's orders, from attacking the American lines. They would probably have entered them, had not the works been completed the night before the action, by closing an opening on the right, and placing an abattis before it. The Americans were most completely surprised and effectually entrapped. Col. Smallwood's Maryland regiment suffered extremely, and was almost cut to pieces, losing 259 men. The loss was much regretted, on account of their being young men of the best-families in
<PB N="103" REF="025347_0104_0FCCFF9B057C4430"/>the country, All who were engaged in the actions of this day did not display the same courage; nor was it to be expected from such raw troops. Many escaped from the want of discipline; for they broke at the sight of danger and saved themselves by flight, whereas otherwise they must have been killed or taken. Large bodies however were cap∣tured. Gen. Sullivan, Lord Stirling, and Gen. Udell, besides three colonels, four lieutenant colonels, three majors, 18 cap∣tains, 43 lieutenants, 11 ensigns, an adju∣tant, three surgeons, and two volunteers, were made prisoners, together with 1006 privates, in all 1007. As among the pri∣soners the wounded were included, an allow∣ance of between four and five hundred for killed, drowned, perished in the woods, the mud, and the like, may be reckoned about the mark; the loss of the British, in killed and wounded, did not exceed 318, of whom only 61 were killed. After the battle, the Americans retreated to New-York, to which place they crossed over under the favour of a fog, taking with them all their military stores, and leaving nothing behind them hut a few pieces of cannon and some trifling matters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the affair of Long Island, en∣deavors were used by the Americans to keep up the spirits of the people, by puf∣fing accounts of the extraordinary bravery of their troops, and the destruction they made of the enemy. But that matters were not very promising appears from a letter of Gen. Mercer who commanded the flying camp, dated Sept. 4th, wherein he writes. "Gen. Washington has not, so far as I have seen, 5000 men to be depended on for the service of a campaign; and I have not 1000. Both
<PB N="105" REF="025347_0106_0FCCFF9DDB3D4FF8"/>our armies are composed of raw militia, perpetually fluctuating between the camp and their farms; poorly armed, and still worse disciplined. These are not a match for, were their numbers equal to, veteran troops, well fitted and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged on by able offi∣cers. Numbers and discipline must at last prevail. Giving soldiers, or even the lower orders of mankind, the choice of officers, will for ever mar the discipline of armies."</P>
<P>Gen. Howe, having fully prepared for a descent on New-York Island, embarked a strong division of the army under the com∣mand of Gen. Clinton and others, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boats, at the head of Newtown inlet, and at ano∣ther place higher up, where they could not be observed by the Americans, who expected the attack would be made on the side next to the East river, and had therefore thrown up lines and works to defend themselves.</P>
<P>On the 15th of September, about eleven o'clock, Gen. Howe's troops landed, under the cover of five ships of war, in two divi∣sions, the Hessians in one place, and the Bri∣tish in another. As soon as Gen. Washing∣ton heard the firing of the men of war, he rode with all dispatch towards the lines; but to his great mortification, found the troops posted in them retreating with the utmost precipitation; and those ordered to support them, Parsons's and Fellows's Brigade fly∣ing in every direction, and in the greatest
<PB N="106" REF="025347_0107_0FCCFFA0040E7F78"/>confusion. His attempts to stop them were fruitless, though he drew his sword, threat∣ened to run them through, and cocked and snapped his pistols.</P>
<P>On the appearance of a small party of the enemy, not more than sixty or seventy, their disorder was encreased, and they ran off with∣out firing a single shot, leaving the general in a hazardous situation, so that his attend∣ants to extricate him out of it, caught the bridle of his horse, and gave him a different direction.</P>
<P>Three large ships were slationed in the North river, opposite to those in the East river, and both kept up a constant cannon∣ading with grape shot and langrage quite across the island. The Hessians, upon their landing, seized and secured, in a neighbor∣ing building, as enemies, some persons who had been placed there to serve as guides, which for a while subjected them to a diffi∣culty.</P>
<P>When the regulars were completely land∣ed, they advanced towards the Kingsbridge∣road. The American brigades, which had fled on the enemy's approaching the lines, did not stop till they were met by Col. Glover's and five other brigades, who were hastening down to them. As soon as they joined, the whole marched forward, and took post on some heights, when suddenly 8000 of the enemy appeared on the next height, and
<PB N="107" REF="025347_0108_0FCCFFA20AD9DCD0"/>halted. Gen. Washington at first consented, that his troops should march forward, and give them battle; but, on a second consider∣ation, he gave counter orders, as he could not have any dependence on the militia and the flying camp, which composed half the number then present. When the Americans retired, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prospect of action remained, the English took possession of New York.</P>
<P>Gen. Washington, while moving the army from New York, into the country, was care∣ful to march and form the troops, so as to make a front towards the enemy, from East Chester almost to White Plains, on the east side of the highway, thereby to secure the march of those who were behind on their right and to defend the removal of the sick, cannon and other matters of consequence; but the want of many necessary articles con∣siderably retarded their march.</P>
<P>On the 25th of October, the royal army moved in two columns, and took a position they thought the most advantageous. Ob∣serving, however, that Gen. Washington's lines were much strengthened by additional works, he deferred all further attack till the arrival of more troops. Several skirmishes had already taken place, but nothing decisive had yet happened.</P>
<P>On the last day of October, Gen. Howe, being joined by the troops from Lord Percy, made dispositions for attacking the Ameri∣can
<PB N="108" REF="025347_0109_0FCCFFA3863AB230" MS="y"/>can lines early the next morning; but an ex∣treme wet night and morning prevented the execution at the time appointed, and it was not attempted afterwards, though the day proved fair. Gen. Washington gained in∣telligence of his danger from a deserter, when he drew off most of his troops at night, to∣tally evacuated his camp early in the morn∣ing of the first of November, and took higher ground towards the North Castle district; leaving a strong rear guard on the heights and in the woods of White Plains. Orders were given by Gen. Howe to attack this corps; but the execution of it was prevented by a violent rain.</P>
<P>Though this affair at White Plains made so much noise at the time in which it hap∣pened, no general action took place, and the Americans retreated, leaving the English in possession of New York and the Jerseys.</P>
<P>Gen. Washington, however, soon after made a descent on Jersey, and at Trenton surprised and took prisoners 23 Hessian offi∣cers, and 886 men of the same nation. In the evening, Gen. Washington repassed the Delaware, and retired to Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>From this period to the month of June, 1777, nothing passed in Jersey but one con∣tinued scene of blood and slaughter among detached parties, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any decisive advan∣tages being gained by either side. On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0th of June, at ten o'clock in the morning,
<PB N="109" REF="025347_0110_0FCCFFA571F448C8"/>the English troops began to cross over to Sta∣ten island, and the rear guard passed at two in the afternoon, without the least appearance of an enemy. Thus they evacuated the Jerseys, to enter upon new conquests, in hopes of reducing the United States to unconditional submission</P>
<P>Let us now turn to the British operations in the North, which were taken out of the hands of Sir Guy Carleton, and committed to the charge of Gen. Burgoyne. The forces allotted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em, consisting of British and German troops, amounted to more than 7000 men, exclusive of the artillery corps. A powerful brass train of artillery was fur∣nished, probably the finest, and the most ex∣cellently supplied, as to officers and private men, that had ever been destined to second th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> operations of an army not exceeding the present number. The army was, in every re∣spect, in the best condition, the troops were in the highest spirits, admirably disciplined, and uncommonly healthy.</P>
<P>The main body under Gen. Burgoyne, proceeded up Lake Champlain, landed and encamped at no great distance from Crown Point, where he met the indians in congress, and afterwards, in compliance with their cus∣toms, gave them a war feast. He made a speech to them, calculated to excite their ardor in the common cause, and at the same time to repress their barbarity. He conjured
<PB N="110" REF="025347_0111_0FCCFFA6F193ECD0"/>them to kill those only who opposed them in arms; that old men, women, children, and prisoners, should be held sacred from the knife or hatchet, even in the heat of actual conflict; that they should scalp those only whom they had slain in fair opposition; but that under no pretence should they scalp the wounded. or even dying, much less kill per∣sons in that condition: they were promised a compensation for prisoners, but informed, that they should be called to account for scalps.</P>
<P>On the near approach of the right wing of the royal army on the Ticonderoga side, the Americans abandoned their works towards Lake George, and left Gen. Phillips to pos∣sess the advantageous post of Mount Hope, without making any resistance, which would have been ineffectual, and could have an∣swered no good purpose. That apparent su∣pineness and want of vigour, with which they were chargeable, was not occasioned by cowardice, but actual imbecility.</P>
<P>Gen. Burgoyne's troops proceeded with much expedition, in the construction of their works, the bringing up of artillery, stores, and provisions; but what gave the greatest alarm was, the rapid progress they made in clearing a road, and getting artillery on Sugar Hill. When once they had erected a battery on this height, only a few hours more would
<PB N="111" REF="025347_0112_0FCCFFA88A66FAA8" MS="y"/>have been required to have invested the Ame∣ricans on all sides.</P>
<P>Gen. St. Clair, having received intelli∣gence by spies, that in twenty four hours the investure would be completed. when he should he cut off from all possibility of suc∣cour, Gen. Schuyler not having force suffi∣cient at fort Edward to relieve him he de∣termined to evacuate his posts, though he knew it would produce such astonishment as had not happened since the commencement of the war. He plainly perceived, that if he continued there, he should lose the army but save his character; whereas, by aban∣doning the place, he should save the army, and lose his character. A council of war was called, and it was unanimously concluded upon to evacuate as soon as possible.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of July the 6th. Gen. St. Clair left Ticonderoga. About three the troops were put in motion for the evacuation of the Mount; but Fer∣mov having set fire to his house, contrary to positive orders, the whole Mount was en∣lightened by it, so that the enemy had an op∣portunity of seeing every thing that passed, which damped the spirits of the Americans, and induced them to push off in a disorderly manner.</P>
<P>In the morning, Gen. Frazer, perceiving the evacuation, and that the Americans were retiring, commanded a pursuit with his bri∣gade,
<PB N="112" REF="025347_0113_0FCCFFA9B942DBF8"/>consisting of the light troops, grena∣diers, and some other corps. Gen. Reidesel, with most of the Brunswickers, was ordered by Gen. Burgoyne to join in the pursuit, either to support Frazer, or to act seperately. The latter continued the pursuit through the day, and receiving intelligence, that St. Clair's rear was at no great distance, he or∣dered his troops to lie that night on their arms. In the morning he came up with the Americans, commanded by Col. War∣ner, who had, besides his own, the regiments of colonels Francis and Hale. The British advanced boldly, and the two bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es formed within about 60 yards of each other. Fra∣zer began the at ack about seven o'clock, ex∣pecting every moment to be joined by Reide∣sel, and apprehending, that if he delayed, the enemy would escape. Hale being ap∣prized of the danger, never brought his re∣giment to the charge, but fled; so that Warner could bring into action no more than about 700 men. The conflict was bloody: Francis fell fighting with great bravery, and Warner, his officers and soldiers, behaved with much resolution and gallantry; so that the British broke and gave way, but soon formed again, and running on the Americans with their bayonets, the latter were put into no small confusion, which was encreased by the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tical arrival of Gen. Reidesel with the foremost of his column, consisting of the
<PB N="113" REF="025347_0114_0FCCFFAD0531C9C8" MS="y"/>Chasseur company, and eighty grenadiers and light infantry, who were immediately led into action. The Americans now fled on all sides. Gen. St. Clair heard when the firing began, and would have supported Warner, but the troops that were nearest, two militia regi∣ments, would not obey orders, and the others were at too great a distance. Hale, who had attempted to get off by flight, fell in with an inconsiderable party of British, and surren∣dered himself and a number of his men pri∣soners. The Americans lost 324 in killed, wounded and prisoners, and among the last were 12 officers. The royal troops, includ∣ing British and German, had not less than 183 killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence surprised Gen. Wash∣ington, and spread astonishment and terror through the New England states The ge∣neral was led to believe that the garrison <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much stronger. The Massachusett's general-court were faulty, in not having seasonably forwarded their quota of troops agreeable to the requisition of congress.</P>
<P>Let us now return to see what was doing by Gen. Howe. The British fleet and army which lay at Sandy Hook, were destined for the reduction of Philadelphia, in pursuance of a plan which had been settted between Sir William Howe and Lord George Germain, but did not sail 'till the 23d of July. The
<PB N="114" REF="025347_0115_0FCCFFAE896CC7E0"/>land forces consisted of thirty six British and Hessian battalions, including the light infantry and grenadiers, with a powerful artillery, a New York corps, called Queen's Rangers, and a regiment of light horse, estimated all together at about 16,000 men. The fleet consisted of 267 sail. Gen. Howe's thus abandoning Burgoyne, equally excited the astonishment of friends and enemies.</P>
<P>On the 14th of June the congress resolved that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.</P>
<P>It was not till the third of September that the royal army began to move forwards. On its advancing near to the Americans, these abandoned their ground, perceiving that it would not answer their first expectation. They crossed Brandywine at Chad's ford, and took possession of the heights on the east side of it, with an evident intention of disputing the passage of the river; but the superior numbers of the regular forces at last obliged them to retire.</P>
<P>A little after sunrise on the 11th of Sep∣tember, a warm engagement commenced, which lasted till the approach of night. On this occasion, the Americans shewed great resolution and courage; but a few hours more of day light might have so animated the conquering reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lars, satigued as they were,
<PB N="115" REF="025347_0116_0FCCFFAFBB54E760"/>as to have produced, those exertions, which would have been productive of a total and ruinous defeat to the Americans. It was said by the Americans themselves, that in this action, their loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners, was about twelve or thirteen hun∣dred; and that the royal army did not suffer, on their part, short of seven or eight hundred, in killed and wounded. The Americans also lost ten small field pieces, and a howitzer, of which all but one were brass.</P>
<P>The evening after the battle, a party of regulars was sent to Wilmington, who took the governor of the Delaware state, Mr. M'Kenley, out of his bed, and possessed themselves of a shallop lying in the creek, loaded with the rich effects of some of the inhabitants, together with the public records of the county, and a large quantity of public and private money, besides articles of plate, and other things.</P>
<P>After various motions of the regular army, on the 26th of September General Howe made his triumphal entry into Philadelphia, with a small part of his army, where he was most cordially received by the generality of the quakers, and a few other royalists. The bulk of his troops were left in and about German town, a village forming one conti∣nued street for near two miles. Gen. Wash∣ington's army was encamped near Shippach-creek about eighteen miles from thence.
<PB N="116" REF="025347_0117_0FCCFFB1AAA0BC28"/>The Congress, on the loss of Philadelphia, removed to York-town.</P>
<P>To return to the northern army, under the command of Gen. Burgoyne. Several actions took place, between the Americans and regulars, in the intended march of the British towards Albany. In these different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irmishes, the regulars suffered very consi∣derably, as well as the indians in their in∣terest. The principal action happened at Bennington, in which the Americans took from the Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> four brass field pieces, twelve drums, 250 dragoon swords, four ammunition waggons, and about 700 pris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers, among wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m was Lieut.

<P>On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gust, the English com∣mander bad occasion to write to Gen. Gates, and in this letter complained of inhumanity exercised towards the provincial soldiers in the king's service, after the affair of Ben∣nington, and then hinted at retaliation. Gen. Gates, in his answer of Sept. the 2d, inva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the charge, and then re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orted the Indian cruelties, which he imputed to Bur∣goyne, saying. "Miss M'Rea, a young lady, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght of virtuous character, and a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>, engaged to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cer in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with other women and children, taken out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> near Fort Edward car∣ried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the woods, and there murdered and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in a most shocking manner. Two
<PB N="117" REF="025347_0118_0FCCFFB2E2FE2528"/>parents, with their six children, were all scalped and treated with the same inhuman∣ity, while quietly residing in their once happy and peaceful dwellings. The miser∣able fate of Miss M'Rea was particularly ag∣gravated, by her being dressed to receive her promised husband, when she met her murderer employed by you. Upwards of one hundred men, women, and children, have perished by the hands of the ruffians, to whom it is asserted, you have paid the price of blood." Gen. Burgoyne, in his reply of the 6th of the same month, vindi∣cated his own character; shewed that Miss M'Rea's death was no premeditated barbar∣ity, and declared, that every other charge, exhibited by Gen. Gates, was ill founded and erroneous.</P>
<P>The murder of Miss M'Rea exasperated the Americans, and from that and other cru∣elties occasion was taken to blacken the royal party and army. The people detested that army which accepted of such Indian aid, and loudly reprobated that government which could call in such auxiliaries. Gen. Gates was not deficient in aggravating, by several publications, the excesses that had taken place, and with no small advantage to his own mil∣itary operations.</P>
<P>On the 18th of September, Gen. Bur∣goyne, having been very short of provisions, at length received a supply for about thirty
<PB N="118" REF="025347_0119_0FCCFFB4D46E8B88"/>days, together with other necessary stores He then resolved upon passing the Hudson's river with the army, which having executed, he encamped on the heights and on the plains of Saratoga. The Americans, observing the motions of the royal army, marched out 3000 strong, in order to attack him, but sound that to be prudentially impracticable. However, they drew up in full view of him, and there remained till dark.</P>
<P>The next day some of the American scout∣ing parties fell in with those of the British, and with great boldness began the attack about one o'clock at noon. The firing was no sooner heard by Gen. Phillips, than he made his way with a part of the artillery, through the woods, and rendered essential services. Each commander supported, re¦inforced, and ordered different regiments to engage. The battle was hot and obstinate on both sides, till about half past two o'clock, when it ceased for half an hour. The Amer∣ican and British lines being fully formed, the action was renewed, and became general at three. Both armies appeared determined to conquer or die, and there was one continual blaze of fire for three hours without intermis∣sion; the report of the muskets resembled an incessant roll beating on a number of drums.—The Americans and British alternate∣ly drove and were driven by each other.—Three British regiments, the 20th, the 21st,
<PB N="119" REF="025347_0120_0FCCFFB5C1DD1CA0"/>and the 62d, were in a constant and close fire for near four hours. All suffered consider∣able loss: the 62d, which was 500 strong when it left Canada, was now reduced to less than 60 men, and to four or five officers. Few ac∣tions have been characterised, by more obsti∣nacy in attack or defence, than was the pre∣sent. Both parties claimed the victory, though neither had much advantage to boast of.</P>
<P>From this time till near the middle of Oc∣tober, battles and skirmishes continually took place between the two armies, and the British were sadly reduced and weakened. On the 13th Gen. Burgoyne, finding that the troops had only three days provisions, in store, on short allowance, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, called into council all the generals, field officers, and captains com∣manding troops. There was not a spot of ground in the whole camp for holding the council of war, but what was exposed to can∣non or rifle shot; and while the council was deliberating, an eighteen-pound ball crossed the table. By the unanimous advice of the council, the general was induced to open a treaty with Gen. Gates. The first propo∣sals of the latter were rejected, and the sixth article with disdain, wherein it was required, that the British army should lay down their arms in their entrenchments. Burgoyne's counter-proposals were unanimously ap∣proved, and being sent to Gates were
<PB N="120" REF="025347_0121_0FCCFFB7397E79B0"/>agreed to, on the 15th, without any material alteration.</P>
<P>Gen. Gates being fearful of the conse∣quences that might follow, should Gen. Vaughan with his troops come up in time to Burgoyne's assistance, determined upon bring∣ing the matter to an immediate issue. On the morning of the 17th, he got every thing in readiness for attacking the royal army. This done he took out his watch, the time agreed for signing being come. He then sent Col. Greaton on horseback to Burgoyne with a message, requiring the general to sign, and allowed him no more than ten minutes to go and return. He was back in time, the treaty was signed, all hostile appearances ceased, and the Americans marched into the British lines to the tune of Yankee Doodle. They were kept there until the royal army had marched out of their lines, and deposited their arms at the place appointed by the treaty.</P>
<P>The delicacy with which this business was conducted reflects the highest honor upon the American general. It intimated that he was sensible of the mortification attending a reverse of fortune, and that he was unwil∣ling to aggravate the painful feelings of the royal troops, by admitting the American soldiers to be eye witnesses to the degrading spectacle of piling their arms. When the arms were deposited agreeable to treaty, the
<PB N="121" REF="025347_0122_0FCCFFB959202CB8" MS="y"/>royal troops were served with bread by the Americans, as they had not any left, nor flour to make it. They had only one day's salt meat remaining.</P>
<P>The treaty was stiled, "A convention between Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne and Major Gen. Gates." Among other articles it was stipulated, "That the troops under Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne shall march out of their camp with the honors of war, and the artillery of the entrenchments, to the verge of the river. where the arms and artillery are to be left.—The arms to be piled by word of command from their own officers. A free passage to be granted to the royal army to Great Bri∣tain, upon condition of not serving again in North America during the present contest; and the port of Boston to be assigned for the entry of transports to receive the troops, whenever Gen. Howe shall so order.—The officers baggage not to be molested or search∣ed.—During the stay of the troops in the Massachusetts bay, the officers are to be ad∣mited on parole, and be allowed to wear their side-arms."</P>
<P>The return signed by Gen. Burgoyne, at the time of the convention, made the British army, including Germans, amount to 5791, which was very short of the number they had on setting out from Canada. The train of brass arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, consisting of 42 pieces, was a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne acquisition to the Americans. There
<PB N="122" REF="025347_0123_0FCCFFBC271324B0"/>were also 4647 muskets, 6000 dozen of car∣tridges, besides shot, carcases, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Had Clinton advanced in time, Burgoyne would have been saved; but the troops he dispatched under General Vaughan amused themselves with burning Esopus, a fine vil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e on the north river, below Catskill. General Vaughan, with a flood tide, might have reached Albany, in four hours, as there was no force to hinder him. Had he pro∣ceeded thither, and burnt the stores, Gates, as he himself afterwards declared, must have retreated into New England.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the end of October, 1777, the royal army, under the command of Sir William Howe, removed to Philadelphia. Measures being concerted between the gene∣ral and admiral for clearing the Delaware of its obstructions, the former ordered batteries to be erected on the western or Pennsylvanian shore, to assist in dislodging the Americans from Mud island. He also detached a strong body of Hessians cross the river, who were to reduce the fort at Red-bank while the ships and batteries on the other side were to attack Mud-Island. Count D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nop, in the service of the English, was intrusted with the expedition against Red-bank, but he failed in the attempt. He was mortally wounded and taken prisoner, several of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s best officers were killed or disabled, and the Hessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, after a desperate engagement, were
<PB N="124" REF="025347_0125_0FCCFFBEC3065A60"/>repulsed. The second in command being also dangerously wounded, the detachment was brought off by Lieut. Col. Linsing. It is said that the royal detachment lost, on this occasion, between four and five hundred men.</P>
<P>The expedition against Mud Island met with better success, the Americans being drive from thence, and forced to retire to Red bank.</P>
<P>On the night of the 18th of November, Lord Cornwallis marched with a considerable force, and the next day crossed the Delaware, in his way to Red bank, which the Ameri∣cans abandoned, leaving behind them the ar∣tillery, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>siderable quantity of cannon ball. The English generals confessed, that the long and unexpected opposition they received from Red-bank and Mud Island, broke in upon their plans for the remainder of the campaign.</P>
<P>On the third of May, 1778, Mr. Simeon Deane arrived in America express from France, with very important dispatches.—The The congress was immediately convened, and the dispatches opened and read, among which, to their inexpressible joy, were a trea∣ty of commerce and a treaty of alliance, concluded between his most christian ma∣jesty the king of France and the United States of America. The treaties were duly weighed and considered seperately the next
<PB N="125" REF="025347_0126_0FCCFFC041D41038" MS="y"/>day, and upon each it was unanimously re∣solved, "That the same be, and is hereby accepted" The next resolution was, "That this congress entertain the highest sense of the magnanimity and wisdom of his most Christian majesty, so strongly exem∣plified in the treaty of amity and commerce; and the commissioners representing their states, at the court of France, are directed to present the grateful acknowledgments of this congress to his most Christian majesty, for his truly magnanimous conduct respect∣ing these states, in the said generous and disinterested treaties, and to assure his ma∣jesty, on the part of this congress, it is sin∣cerely wished, that the friendship, so happily commenced between France and these United States may be perpetual."</P>
<P>The congress, after receiving the treaties, had a stronger feeling of their own import∣ance than before, and resolved, "That the cummis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oners appointed for the courts of Spain, Tuscany, Vienna, and Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, should live in such stile and manner at their respec∣tive courts, as they may find suitable and ne∣cessary to support the dignity of their public character."</P>
<P>On the first of May, they agreed to a draught of "An address to the inhabitants of the United States of America." In this publication, when they come to the French treaty, they say, "You have still to expect
<PB N="126" REF="025347_0127_0FCCFFC2AEF10760"/>one seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e conflict.

Foiled in the principal design, you must expect to feel the rage of disap∣pointed ambition. Arise then! to your tents, and gird you for battle! It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the destroyer. They have filled up the measure of their abominations, and like ripe fruit must soon drop from the tree. Al∣though much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, while any corner of America is in the possession of your foes. You must drive them away from this land of Pro∣mise, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren at the extremities of the continent already implore your friendship and protection. It is your duty to grant their request. They hunger and thrift after liberty. Be it yours to dispense to them the heavenly gift. And what is there now to prevent it?"</P>
<P>In the month of May the American fri∣gate, Randolph of 36 guns, and 305 men, sailed on a cruise from Charlestown. The Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmouth, of 64 guns, disovered her and five other vessels, and came up with her in the evening. Capt, Vincent hailed the Ran∣dolph to hoist colours, or he would fire into

<PB N="127" REF="025347_0129_0FCCFFC70CDA5050"/>her; on which she hoisted American, and immediately gave the Yarmouth her broad∣side, which was returned, and in about a quarter of an hour she blew up. Four men saved themselves upon a piece of her wreck, and subsisted for five days upon nothing more than rain water which they sucked from a piece of blanket they had picked up. On the fifth, the Yarmouth being in chace of a ship, happily discovered them waving. The captain humanely suspended the chace, hauled up to the wreck, got a boat out and brought them on board.</P>
<P>On the 7th of May the second battalion of British light infantry, in Flat boats, at∣tended by three gallies and other armed boats, proceeded up the Delaware, in order to destroy all the American ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and vessels l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in the river between Philadelphia and Trenton.

The country being alarmed, and a strong body collected, the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion crossed to the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsylvani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shore. The next day they resumed their operations, and at sunset embarked and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned to Phi∣ladelphia. While upon the expedition, they burnt two fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the other of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> guns; nine l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge ships, three pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ct

<P>Gen Howe was succeeded in the com∣mand of the army by Sit Henry Clinton, who arrived at Philadelphia on the eighth of May.</P>
<P>On the sixth of February the treaties be∣tween France and the United States were signed. The alliance batween these two powers was known to the British ministry soon after they were signed. Mr. Fox, in a debate in the House of Commons five days afterwards, asserted, that the number of men lost to the army, in killed, disabled, deserted, and from various other causes, from the com∣mencement of hoslilities with America to that period, amounted to above twenty thou∣sand.</P>
<P>On the 17th Lord North introduced his conciliatory propositions. His plan was to enable the crown to appoint commissioners to treat with the colonies concerning the means of putting a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> end to those unhappy contests; for which five persons were invest∣ed with ample powers. His Lordship said in his speech, that Gen. Howe had been in the late actions, and in the whole course of the campaign, not only in the goodness of troops, and in all manner of supplies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also in
<PB N="129" REF="025347_0131_0FCCFFCAC205EDD8"/>point of numbers, much superior to the American army that opposed him in the field; that Gen. Burgoyne had been in num∣bers, until the affair at Bennington, nearly twice as strong as the army of the enemy; that he promised a great army should be sent out, and that a great army had accordingly been sent out, to the amount of 60,000 men and upwards.</P>
<P>The speech was long, able, and eloquent, and kept him up two full hours. A dull melancholy silence for some time succeeded. It was heard with profound attention, but without a single mark of approbation. Aston∣ishment, dejection, and fear, over-clouded the whole assembly. It was conjectured, that some powerful motive had induced ministry to adopt such an alteration of measures. This idea was confirmed by the positive assertion of Mr. Fox, that a treaty had been signed at Paris between the colonies and France, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich she recognized her independence.</P>
<P>On the 13th of March, the French am∣bassador delivered a rescript to Lord Wey∣mouth, in which he informed the court of London, that the king had signed a treaty of friendship and commerce with the United States of America. The knowledge of this transaction was communicated under the par∣ade of cultivating the good understanding between France and Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="025347_0132_0FCCFFCCF920F830"/>
On the 21st of March, a public audience and reception were given to the American commissioners, Mess. Franklin, Deane, and Lee, by the French monarch. They were introduced by Mons. Vergennes, and receiv∣ed by the king with the usual formalities and ceremonies. The striking acknowledg∣ment of the plenipotentiaries from the United States mortified the ministry and crown of Great Britain, and may be pronounced the political phenomenon of Europe. The day before it was exhibited, the French emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssa∣dor, in consequence of orders to quit Lon∣don, set out for Paris.</P>
<P>From this time, the courts of London and Versailles were busied in fitting out their fleets, which met each other in the month of July. The English fleet was commanded by the Admirals Keppel, Pallier, and Har∣land. But, as the action of that day is am∣ply related in our History of England, we shall not introduce in these annals of Ame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ica, an account of so foul a tarnish to the British flag.</P>
<P>In the beginning of June, the Trident British man of war arrived in the Delaware, with the Earl of Carlisle, Mr. Eden and Gov. Johnstone, three of the commissioners for restoring peace between Great Britain and America.</P>
<P>On the 18th of June, at three o'clock in the morning, the British ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ated Philadel∣phia,
<PB N="131" REF="025347_0133_0FCCFFCF9DCF4578"/>Mr. Eden having brought with him se∣cret instructions from England for that pur∣pose. They proceeded to Gloucesler point, three miles down the river, and before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en the whole had passed in safety cross the Delaware into New-Jersey.</P>
<P>When intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having evacuated Philadelphia reached the American head-quarters. Gen. Washington took his measures accordingly. Several skir∣mishes happened between the Americans and the regulars with various success, till on the goth of June the royal army arrived in the neighborhood of Sandy Hook. During the course of the march from Philadelphia, the royal army was much reduced, upwards of 800 having deserted, a great number of whom were Hessians.</P>
<P>On the 5th of July, the army passed over a bridge of boats cross a narrow channel to Sandy Hook, and were afterwards carried up to Newyork. On the 7th Lord Howe re∣ceived advice, that the squadrom from Tou∣lon was arrived at Virginia. Count d'Estaing anchored on the 8th at night at the entrance of the Delaware. The next morning he weighed and sailed towards the Hook, and on the evening of the 11th anchored without it. Had not bad weather and unexpected im∣pedimen's prevented, the Count must have surprised Howe's fleet in the Delaware, as the latter would not have had time to escape
<PB N="132" REF="025347_0134_0FCCFFD0C5DABFB0"/>after being apprised of his danger. The de∣struction of the fleet must have been the con∣sequence of such a surprisal, and that must have accasioned the inevitable loss of the royal army, which would have been so en∣closed by the French squadron on the one side, and the American forces on the other, that the Saratoga catastrophe must have been repeated. Lord Howe's fleet consisted only of six sixty four gun ships, three of fifty, and two of forty, with some frigates and sloops. Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Estaing had twelve ships of the line, some of which were of great force and weight.</P>
<P>On the and of July, the count sailed from Sandy Hook, when about twenty sail of ves∣sels bound to New York fell into his posses∣sion. They were chiefly prizes taken from the Americans; but had he stayed a few days longer, Admiral Byron's fleet must have fallen a defenceless prey into their hands. That squadron had met with unusual bad weather, and being seperated in different storms, and lingering through a tedious pas∣sage, arrived scattered, broken, sickly, dis∣masted, or otherwise damaged in various de∣grees of distress, upon different and remote parts of the American coast. Between the departure of d'Estaing and the 30th of July, the Renown of 50 guns from the West-In∣dies, the Raisonable and Centurion of 64, and the Cornwall of 74 guns, all arrived
<PB N="133" REF="025347_0135_0FCCFFD3082DBC18"/>singly at Sandy Hook. By d'Estaing's speedy departure a number of provision ships from Cork escaped also, together with their con∣voy. They went up the Delaware within fifty miles of Philadelphia after Lord Howe had quitted the river, not having obtained any information of what had happened. The British ministry had neglected countermand∣ing their destination, though orders for the evacuation of Philadelphia had been sent off so early, as to have admitted of their receiv∣ind fresh instructions where to have steered before sailing. Great rejoicings were made at New York upon their safe arrival, especi∣ally as provisions were much wanted both by the fleet and army.</P>
<P>Let us now quit the military operations for the present and take a view of the pending negociations. Gov. Johnstone, meaning to avail himself of former connections, endea∣voured to commence or renew a private cor∣respondence with several members of con∣gress, and other persons of consideration. In his letter to them he used a freedom with the authority under which he acted, not cus∣tomary with those entrusted with delegated power, and afforded such a degree of appro∣bation to the Americans in the past resistance they had made, as is seldom granted by ne∣gociators to their opponents. In a letter to Joseph Reed, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of April 11th, he said "The man, who can be instumental in
<PB N="134" REF="025347_0136_0FCCFFD4815B6980" MS="y"/>bringing us all to act once more in harmony, and to unite together the various powers which their contest has brought forth, will de∣serve more from the king and people, from patriotism, humanity, and all the tender tie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that are affected by the quartel and reconci∣liation, than ever was yet bestowed on human kind."</P>
<P>On the 16th of June, he wrote to Robert Morris, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> "I believe the men, who have conducted the affairs of America, in∣capable of being influenced by improper mo∣tives; but in all such transactions there is risk, and I think that whoever ventures should be sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed; at the same time that honor and emo∣lument should naturally follow the fortune of those, who have steered she vessel in the storm, and brought her safety to port. I think that Washington and the president have a right to every favour that a grateful nation can bestow, if they could once more unite our interest, and spare the miseries and de∣vastations of war."</P>
<P>On Sunday the 21st of June, Mr. Reed received a written message from Mrs Fer∣guson, expressing a desire to see him on bu∣siness, which could not be committed to writing. On his attending in the evening, agreeable to her appointment, after some pre∣vious conversation, she enlarged upon the great talents and amiable qualities of Gov. Johnstone, and added, that in several conver∣sations
<PB N="135" REF="025347_0137_0FCCFFD5FAB29898"/>with her, he had expressed the most favorable sentiments of Mr. Reed; that it was particularly wished to engage his in∣terest to promote the object of the British commissioners, viz. a re-union of the two countries, if consistent with his principles and judgment; and that in such case it could not be deemed unbecoming or improper in the British government to take a favorable notice of such conduct; and that, in this in∣stance, Mr. Reed might have ten thousand pounds sterling, and any office in the colonies in his majesty's gift.</P>
<P>Mr. Reed, finding an answer was expect∣ed, replied, "I am not worth purchasing; but such as I am, the king of Great Britain is not rich enough to do it." However right, the principles might be, on which this insi∣nuating scheme of conciliation was adopted, its effects were inimical.</P>
<P>On the 9th of July, congress ordered, "That all letters received by members of congress from any of the British commis∣sioners, or their agents, or from any subject of the king of Great Britain, of a public nature, be laid before congress" The pre∣ceding letters, being communicated, and Mr. Reed making a declaration of what had passed within his knowledge, congress resolved, "That the same cannot be considered but as direct attempts to corrupt and bribe the con∣gress; that as congress feel, so they ought to
<PB N="136" REF="025347_0138_0FCCFFD8AA1FDBF8"/>demonstrate, the highest and most pointed indignation against such daring and atrocious attempts to corrupt their integrity; and that it is incompatible with the honour of con∣gress to hold any manner of correspondence or intercourse with the said George John∣stone, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> especially to negociate with him upon affairs, in which the cause of liberty is concerned."</P>
<P>The proceedings in this business were ex∣pressed in the form of a declaration, a copy of which was ordered to be signed by the president, and sent by a flag to the commis∣sioners at Newyork.</P>
<P>These proceedings produced a very angry and violent declaration from Gov. Johnstone, in which the immediate operations of passion and disappointment were too conspicious. The language of his publication but poorly agreed with the high and flatter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng compli∣ments he had so lately lavished on the Ame∣ricans in those very letters, which were the subject of the present contest. It was dated the 26th of August, and transmitted to con∣gress; together with a declaration of the same date from Lord Carlisle. Sir Henry Clinton, and Mr. Eden, which went to a solemn and total disavowel, so far as related to the present subject, of their having had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny knowledge, directly or indirectly, of these matters specified by congress.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="025347_0139_0FCCFFD9CF326D38"/>
Thus were all hopes of further negocia∣tion with congress at an end. Had Lord North, and the rest of the ministry then in being, adopted these corrupting measures in the more early part of the Amrican disputes, it is possible he might have succeeded; but to attempt it at a time when the spirits of the Americans were raised to the highest pitch by their new alliance with France, was surely little short of folly and madness.</P>
<P>On the 6th of August, the Hon. Sieur Gerard was introduced to the congress, in quality of minister plenipotentiary, who pro∣duced a letter from his master the king of France to <HI>his very dear great friends and allies;</HI> and the compliments Mons. Gerard received on this occasion, were very different from those sentiments the Americans lately enter∣tained of their <HI>now</HI> faithful allies!</P>
<P>On the 14th of September, congress pro∣ceeded to the election of a minister plenipo∣tentiary to the court of France, when Dr. Benjamin Franklin was elected by ballot. His instructions were dated the 26th of Oc∣tober, and by them he was directed to ob∣tain, if possible, the French king's consent to expunge two of the articles of the treaty of commerce. The doctor was to inculcate the certainty of ruining the British fishery on the banks of Newfoundland, and conse∣quently the British marine, by reducing Hal∣ifax and Quebec.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE campaign in the northern states hav∣ing produced nothing advantageous to the British, and the winter being the proper season for southern expeditions, Sir Henry Clinton concluded upon turning his arms against Georgia. He might propose to him∣self the reduction of all the southern states, and he strongly inclined to it, by reason that these states produced the most valuable articles of commerce for the European market, and carried on a considerable export trade, which appeared no otherwise affected by the war, than as it suffered from the British cruisers. The rice was devoted to the ser∣vice of its enemies, while it was wanted for the support of the royal sleet and army in America. A plan of operations was con∣certed with Gen. Prevost, who commanded in East Florida; and it was intended, that Georgia should be invaded both on the north and south sides at the same time.</P>
<P>This expedition was committed to Col. Campbell, and the forces appointed to act under him amounted to full 2500, which sailed from Sandy Hook, on the 27th of November, being escorted by a small squadron under Commodore Hyde Parker. The fleet arrived at the isle of Tibee, near the mouth of the
<PB N="140" REF="025347_0142_0FCCFFDE44E03310"/>Savannah, and on the 29th of December, the troops effected a landing. They were no sooner landed, than they were led to attack the fort, which the British persisted in with so much spirit and rapidity, that the Ameri∣cans retreated with precipitation and disorder. No victory was ever more complete: thirty-eight officers, and 415 non-commissioned and privates, 48 pieces of cannon, 23 mortars, the fort with its ammunition and stores, the shipping in the river, a large quantity of pro∣visions, with the capital of Georgia, were all within the space of a few hours, in the possession of the British troops.</P>
<P>The 30th of December was appointed as a thanksgiving-day, by order of congress. The affairs of the United States were at this period in a most distressed, deplorable, and ruinous condition. Idleness, dissipation, and extravagance, seemed to have engrossed the attention of the generality of the American sons of liberty; and self-interest, speculation, and an insatiable thirst for riches a peared to have got the better of every other considera∣tion, and almost of every order of men. Party disputes and personal quarrels were too much the general object, while the moment∣ous concerns of the empire, a vast accumu∣lated debt, ruined finances, depreciated mon∣ey, and want of credit, which naturally brings on the want of every thing, were but secondary considerations, and postponed by
<PB N="141" REF="025347_0143_0FCCFFDFC6A92788"/>congress from time to time, as if their affairs were in the most flourishing situation. The paper currency in Philadelphia was daily sink∣ing, and at length even so low as fifty per cent, yet an assembly, a concert, a dinner, or supper, which cost two or three hundred pounds, did not only take men off from act∣ing, but even from thinking of what ought to have been nearest their hearts. Some of the most disinterested and patriotic Ameri∣cans felt more distress from this review of things, than they had done at any other time, from the disappointments and losses in the course of the war.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mons. Gerard, the French ambassador, manifested a desire, that the war might not be prolonged by too high and unreasonable demands, and that the United States would reduce their ultimatum as low as possible. He strongly recommend∣ed moderation, as the fate of war was uncer∣tain; and he hinted, that a decisive naval engagement in favour of the British, might give a great turn to their affairs.</P>
<P>The South-Carolina delegates, rather with a view to conquest, than from any special apprehension of danger to their own or neighbouring states, from the troops under Gen. Clinton, requested the Congress to ap∣point Gen. Lincoln on whose character they justly reposed great confidence, to the com∣mand of all the forces to the southward. Ac∣cordingly
<PB N="142" REF="025347_0144_0FCCFFE145B5E618" MS="y"/>they made the appointment on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5th of September, and ordered him imme∣diately to repair to Charlestown.</P>
<P>On the 2d of March, the American offi∣cer of the day reported, that reconno t∣ring parties of the enemy's horse and foot had been seen within their piquet the night pre∣ceding. Gen. Ashe, who had crossed the Savannah, with about 1200 troops, besides 200 light horse, returned on the evening of the same day to his camp. In short, the conduct of Gen. Ashe was so pusillanimous, that he made no preparations to impede the march of the British, and, soon after their appearance, he and his troops fled with pre∣cipitation, without firing a gun.</P>
<P>In the month of May Sir Henry Clinton dispatched Sir George Collier and Gen. Mat∣thews, with about 2000 men, besides 500 marines, to make a descent upon Virginia. They sailed for Portsmooth in that Province, and upon their arrival landed their troops at a distance, then marched and took immedi∣ate possession of the town, which was de∣senceless. The remains of Norfolk, on the opposite side of the river, fell of course into their hands. On the approach of the fleet and army, the Americans burnt several ves∣sels, others were saved and possessed by the British. The guards were pushed forwards eighteen miles by night to Suffolk, where they arrived by day light and proceeded to
<PB N="143" REF="025347_0145_0FCCFFE2DA726A90"/>destroy a magazine of provisions, together with the vessels and naval stores found there. A similar destruction was carried on at other places in that quarter, nor were the frigates and armed vessels less active or succes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful in their service.</P>
<P>Within the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>night that the fleet and army continued upon the coast, the loss of the Americans was prodigious. Above 130 vessels of all sorts, including some privateers, and ships of force, were destroyed or taken by them; seventeen prizes were brought away, besides 3000 hogsheads of tobacco, which fell into their possession at Portsmouth. Except the house of a widow and the church, they burnt every house in Suffolk, and all the principal houses of gentlemen in this route shared the same fate.</P>
<P>On the 30th of May, the troops were joined to others going up the North river to attack the posts of Stoney Point and Ver∣plank, where the Americans had begun to construct strong works, for keeping the lower communication open between the east∣ern and southern states. Gen. Vaughan landed with the greater part on the east-side, while the remainder, accompanied by Sir Henry Clinton, advanced further up, landed on the west side, and took possession of Stoney Point without opposition. Directly opposite, the Americans had completely fin∣ished a strong sort, which was defended by
<PB N="144" REF="025347_0146_0FCCFFE7621D1BC8"/>four pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and a garrison o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about seventy men. But it was commanded by Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; to the summit of whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocks cannon and mortars were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ragged up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring the night. By five in the morning, a battery was opened, which poured a storm of fire on the fort, while Vaughan with his division, made a long circuit by the sides of the hills, arrived and closely invested it by land. The garison, finding themselves totally overpowered, surrendered themselves prison∣ers of war. By the loss of these posts, the Jersey people were obliged to make a circuit of about ninety miles under the mountains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> communicate with the states c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of Hud∣son's river.</P>
<P>After the French had taken Grenada, and Count d'Estaing was lying with his fleet at Cape Francos, he received letters from Gov. Rutledge, Gen. Lincoln, the French consul at Charlestown, and others, urging him to visit the Amercan coast, and propos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng an attack upon Savannah. The general engaged to join him with a thousand men certain, and promised that every exertion should be made to increase the number. The application coinciding with the king's in∣structions, to act in concert with the forces of the United States, whenever an occasion presented itself, he sailed for the American continent within a few days after it was re∣ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="025347_0147_0FCCFFE8C16C3E18"/>
On the 1st of September, Count d'Estaing arrived with a fleet of twenty sail of the line, two of fifty guns, and eleven frigates. The appearance of the French fleet on the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia was so un∣expected by the British that the Experiment man of war. of fifty guns, Sir James Wal∣lace, commander, and three friga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, were captured. No sooner was it known at Charlestown, that the Count was on the coast, than Lincoln marched with all expedition for Savannah, with the troops under his com∣mand; and orders were also given for the South, Caro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na and Georgia militia to ren∣dezvous immediately near the same place.—The British were equally diligent in pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>paring for their defence.</P>
<P>The French and Americans, after having spent some time in making regular approaches at last determined to take the place by storm. Accordingly the morning of the 9th of Oc∣tober was fixed for the attack, and neither the French nor the Americans had the least doubts of success.</P>
<P>Two feints were made with the country militia, and a real attack a little before day∣light, on the Spring-hill battery, with 3500 French troops, 600 continentals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od 350 of the Charlestown militia, headed by Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'Estaing and Gen. Lincoln. They marched up to the lines with g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat boldness; but a heavy and well directed fire from the batteries,
<PB N="146" REF="025347_0148_0FCCFFEA3983FBD8" MS="y"/>and a cross fire from the gallies threw the front of the column into confusion. Two standards, however, one an American, were pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed on the British redoubts. Count Pulaski at the head of 200 horsemen, was in full gallop. riding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> town between the re∣doubts, with an intent of charging in the rear, when he received a mortal wound. A general retreat of the assailants took place, after they had stood the enemy's fire for fifty five minutes. D'Estaing received two slight wounds; 637 of his troops, and 234 of the continentals, were killed or wounded. Of the 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Charlestown militia who were in the hotest of the fire, only six were wound∣ed, and a captain killed. Gen. Prevost and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Moncrieff deservedly acquired great reputation by their successful defence. There were not ten guns mounted on the lines when the enemy first appeared, and in a few days the number exceeded eighty. The garrison was between two and three thousand, includ∣ing 150 militia. The damage it sustained was trifling as the men fired under cover, and few of the assailants fired at all.</P>
<P>Let us now see what the northern army was doing. In the middle of December, a part of Gen. Washington's army was with∣out bread and for the rest he had not, either on the spot or within reach, a supply sufficient for foor days. Both officers and men were almost perishing through want for a fortnight.
<PB N="147" REF="025347_0149_0FCCFFED4F15B990"/>The deficiency proceeded from the absolute emptiness of the American magazines in every place, and the total want of money and credit to replenish them. So that the general was obliged to call upon the magis∣trates of the Jersey state, to express his situa∣tion to them, and to declare in plain terms, that he and his army were reduced to the al∣ternative of disbanding or catering for them∣selves, unless the inhabitants would afford them aid. He alloted to each county a cer∣tain proportion of flour or grain, and a cer∣tain number of cattle to be delivered on cer∣tain days. To the honor of the magistrates, and the good dispositions of the people, be it added, that these requisitions were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ally complied with, and in many c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nties ex∣ceeded.</P>
<P>But to return to the sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nern armies. On the 20th of March, 1780, Admiral Arbuth∣not, with a small fleet crossed the bar, in front of rebellion road, and anchored in Five Fathom Hole. The American fleet re∣treated to Charlestown, and the crews and guns of all the vessels, except the Ranger, were put on shore to reinforce the batteries. Before the Americans had taken this st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, they should have considered, whether the ships were able to defend the bar, and should have sent them off, when they found it im∣practicable.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="025347_0150_0FCCFFEEBA6BC7B0"/>
On the 12th of April, the British opened their batteries against Charlestown, and a constant fire was kept up between both par∣ties until the 20th. On the 18th of April, Sir Henry Clinton received a reinforcement of 3000 men from New York; and on the 12th of May, Gen. Lincoln, after having made the most vigorous defence he was ca∣pable of, was obliged to capitulate. It was stipulated, that the continental troops and sailors should remain prisoners of war until exchanged, and be provided with good and wholesome provisions, in such quantities as were served out to the British troops. The militia were to return home as prisoners on parole, which, as long as they observed, was to secure them from being molested in their property by the British troops. The officers of the army and navy were to keep their swords, pistols, and baggage, which last was not to be searched; but their horses were not to go out of town, but might be disposed of by a person left for the purpose. The gar∣rison, at an hour appointed, was to march out of the town to the ground between the works of the place and the canal, where they were to deposit their arms. The drums were not to beat a British march, nor the colours to be uncased. All civil officers and citizens, who had borne arms during the siege, were to be prisoners on parole; and with respect to their property in the city, they were to have
<PB N="149" REF="025347_0151_0FCCFFF05F44E200"/>the same terms as the militia; and all other persons in the town, not described in any ar∣ticle, were notwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>standing to be prisoners upon parole.</P>
<P>The capital having surrendered, the next object of the British was to secure the gene∣ral submission of the inhabitants. With this view they posted garrisons in different parts of the country, and marched a large body of troops over the Santee, towards the extremity of the state, which borders on the most populous parts of North Carolina. This oc∣casioned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of some American parties, who had advanced into the upper part of South Carolina, in expectation of relieving Charlestown. Among the corps which had co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> forward with that view, there was one consisting of about 300 conti∣nentals, the rear of the Virginia line, com∣manded by Col. Buford. Tarleton, with about 700 horse and foot, was sent in quest of this party. Having mounted his infantry, he marched 105 miles in fifteen hours, came up with them at the Waxhaws, and demand∣ed their surrender on terms similar to those granted to the continentals at Charlestown. While the flags were passing and repassing on this business, Tarleton kept his men in motion, and, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruce was ended, had nearly surrounded his adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>aries. An action instantly ensued, when the continental party, having partaken of the general consternation
<PB N="150" REF="025347_0152_0FCCFFF2F001FE48" MS="y"/>occasioned by the British successes, made but a feeble resistance, and begged for quarter. A few, however, continued to fire. The British cavalry advanced, but were not oppo∣sed by the main body of the continentals. who conceived themselves precluded by their submission. The accidental firing of the few was an argument, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> direct∣ing the British legion to charge those who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad laid down their arms. In consequence of this order, the unresisting Americans, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aying for quarters, were cut in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ces. By Tarleton's official accourt of this bloody scene, 113 were killed, 50 badly wounded, unable to travel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d left on pa∣role, and 53 made prisoners, while they made such ineffectual opposition as only to kill seven and wound twelve of the British. Lord Cornwallis bestowed on Tarleton the highest encomiums for this enterprize, and recommended him in a special manner to royal favour and patronage.</P>
<P>The expected succours at length arrived from France, on the evering of the 10th of July, at Rhode-Island. The Chevalier de Ternay commanded the fleet, which consist∣ed of two shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y guns, one of 74, four of 64. a bomb vessel, and 32 transports. The land forces consisted of four old regi∣ments, besides the legion de Lau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un, and a battalion of artillery, amounting to about
<PB N="151" REF="025347_0153_0FCCFFF402C06820"/>6000 men, under the command of Lieut. Gen. Count de Rochambeau.</P>
<P>About the time that Charlestown suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er∣ed, Sir H. Clinton received intelligence, that a large number of forces and a French sleet, commanded by Mons. Ternay, might soon be expected on the American coast. This induced him to reimbark for New-York, leaving Lord Cornwallis with about 4000 men, which were deemed fully suffi∣cient for his purposes.</P>
<P>On the 4th of September was signed the plan of a treaty of commerce between the states of Holland and the United States of America, Mons. de Neufville, being prop∣erly authorized by the regency of Amster∣dam, engaged, that as long as America should not act contrary to the interest of the states of Holland, the city of Amsterdam would never adopt any measure that might tend to oppose the interest of America; but would, on the contrary, use all ts' influence upon the states of the seven United Prov∣inces of Holland, to effect the desired connec∣tion. This business was conducted by Mr. Adams on the part of America.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis went on successfully in South Carolina. On the 16 h of August he engaged the forces under Gen. Gates, and completely routed them after a long and obstinate contest. Gen. Gates was borne off the field by a torrent of dismayed militia.
<PB N="152" REF="025347_0154_0FCCFFF586CF54F8"/>They constituted so great a part of his army, that when he saw them break and run with such precepitation, be lost every hope of vic∣tory; and his only care was, if possible, to rally a sufficient number to cover the retreat of the other troops. He retired with Gen. Caswell to Clermont, in hope of halting them in their late encampment; but the fur∣ther they fled, the more they dispersed, and the generals giving up all as lost, retired with a few attendants to Charlotte.</P>
<P>The Americans lost eight field pieces, the whole of their artillery, with all their ammu∣nition waggons, besides 150 others, and a considerable quantity of military stores, and the greatest part of their baggage. The numbers slain cannot be precisely ascertained, no returns of the militia ever being made after the action: but it is supposed, that the Americans lost about 700 on this occasion. Though Cornwallis's victory was complete, yet, from the account the British gave of the action, it may be inferred, that it was dearly bought, upwards of 500 of their own troops being killed or wounded.</P>
<P>A minute representation of the retreat of the Americans from Charlotte to Salisbury, would be the image of complicated wretch∣edness. Care, anxiety, pain, humiliation, and dejection, poverty, hurry and confusion, promiscuously marked the shocking scene. Painful objects presented themselves to view;
<PB N="153" REF="025347_0155_0FCCFFF6FAFF0318"/>several men without an arm, some with but one, and many standing in need of the most kind and powerful assistance.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis, nowithstanding his vic∣tory, was restrained for some time from pur∣suing his conquests, by the loss he had sus∣tained in the battle, the extreme heat of the weather, the sickliness of the season and the want of necessary supplies; he therefore re∣mained at Cambden.</P>
<P>In the month of September, a discovery of the utmost importance was made, which was a scheme for delivering West Point into the hands of Sir Henry Clint on. Gen. Ar∣nold, who had the command of that post, was brave but mercenary, fond of parade, and extremely desirous of acquiring money to defray the expen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of it. When he en∣tered Philadelphia after the evacuation, be made Gov. Penn's, the best house in it, his head quarters. This be furnished in a very costly manner, and lived in a stile far beyond his income. He continued his extravagant course of living, was unsuccessful in trade and privateering, his funds were exhausted, and his creditors importunate, while his lust for high life was not in the least abated. He had exhibited heavy accounts and demands against the public; and the commissioners, upon examination, rejected about one half of the amount. He appealed to congress, and a committee was appointed, who were
<PB N="154" REF="025347_0156_0FCCFFF9068B8980" MS="y"/>of opinion, that the commissioners had al∣lowed more than the general had a right to expect or demand. This provoked him to outrageous expressions and proceedings. Dis∣gusted at the treatment he had met with, embarrassed in his circumstances, and having a growing expensive family, he turned his thoughts towards bettering his circumstances by new means. In 1779, a correspondence commenced between Gen. Arnold and Major Andre, adjutant-general to the British army, a rising young officer of great hope and merit.</P>
<P>For the speedy completion of the negocia∣tion that was carrying on between Sir Henry and Gen. Arnold, the Vulture sloop of war was stationed in the North River. at such a distance from the American posts, as, with∣out exciting suspicion, would serve for the necessary communication. Before this, a written correspondence through other chan∣nels, had been maintained between Arnold and Andre at New York, under the names of Gustavus and Anderson. √</P>
<P>On the 21st of September, the necessary arrangenents being made, a boat was sent at night from the shore to the Vulture, to fetch Major Andre, which brought him to the beach without the posts of either army, where he met Arnold The major continued with him during the day following, and at night, the boatman refusing to conduct him
<PB N="155" REF="025347_0157_0FCCFFFA76CC0BB0"/>back to the Vulture, which had shifted her position, as she lay exposed to the fire of a cannon sent to annoy her, he was obliged to concert his escape by land. He quitted his uniform, which he had hitherto worn under his surtout, for a common coat. He was furnished with a horse, and under the name of John Anderson. with a passport from Ar∣nold to go through the lines at White Plains or lower if he thought proper, he being on public business.</P>
<P>He pursued his journey alone towards York, passed all the guards and posts on the road without suspicion, and was much elated. The next day he travelled without any alarm, and began to consider himself out of dangers but unhappily for him, three of the New-York militia were with others on a sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing party between the out posts of the two armies. One of them sprung from his co∣vert, and seized And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> horse by the bridle. The major instead or instantly producing his pass, asked the man where he belonged to, who answered, <HI>"To below."</HI> Andre suspecting no deceit, said, <HI>"So do I."</HI> Then declared himself a British officer, and pressed that he might not be detained, for that he was upon urgent business. Upon the other two coming up, and joining their comrade, he discovering his mistake. The confusion that followed was apparent, and they pro∣ceeded to search him till they found his pa∣pers.
<PB N="156" REF="025347_0158_0FCCFFFB7B98CE30"/>He offered the captors a considerable purse of gold, and a very valuable watch, to let him pass; but they nobly disdained the temptation, besides the fascinating offers of permanent provision, and even of future promotion, on condition of their conveying and accompanying him to Newyork They conducted him to Lieut. Col. Jameson, the continental officer who had the command of the scouting parties, amounting to 800 men, chiefly militia. Arnold's conduct with regard to this body of men, and in other re∣spects, had excited such suspicions in the breast of the lieutenant-colonel, and the rest of the officers, that they had determined upon seizing the general at all events, had he come down and ordered them nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the enemy. Jameson, notwithstanding his strong jealousy of Arnold, was in the issue the means of his escape.</P>
<P>Major Andre, in order to give Arnold time to escape, requested that a line might be sent to acquaint him of the detention of Anderson, the name Andre had assumed, which Jameson, through an ill-judged deli∣cacy granted. The papers, which were found in the major's boots, were in Arnold's hand writing, and contained exact returns of the state of the forces, ordnances and defences at West Point and its dependencies, with the artillery orders, critical remarks on the works, an estimate of the number of men
<PB N="157" REF="025347_0159_0FCCFFFCF9F36B30" MS="y"/>that were ordinarily on duty to man them, and the copy of a state of matters that had been laid before a council of war by the commander in chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> These papers were enclosed in a packet to Gen. Washington, accompanied with a letter from the prisoner, avowing himself to be Major Andre, adju∣tant general to the British army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavouring to show, that he did not come under the de∣scription of a spy. These papers were for∣warded by Jameson.</P>
<P>No sooner had Arnold received the Major's letter, than he hastened on board the Vul∣ture, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay some miles below Stoney and Verplank's Points; and Arnold had not been long gone, when Washington arrived at his quarters. Had the plot succeeded, the con∣sequences must have been ruinous to the Americans. The forces under Arnold's command must have either laid down their arms, or have been cut to pieces. Their loss, and the immediate possession of West-Point, and all its neighbouring dependencies, must have exposed the remainder of Wash∣ington's army so, to the joint exertion of the British forces, by land and water, that no∣thing but ruin could have been the result with respect to the Americans.</P>
<P>On the 29th of September Gen. Wash∣ington appointed a board of fourteen general officers, with the assistance of the judge ad∣vocate
<PB N="158" REF="025347_0160_0FCCFFFE81301F78"/>general, to examine Major Andre's case, and to determine in what light it ought to be considered. Andre, disdaining all sub∣terfuge and evasion, and studying only to place his character in so fair a light, as might prevent its being shaded by present circum∣stances, voluntarily confessed more than he was asked, and sought not to palliate any thing relating to himself, while he concealed, with the most guarded and scrupulous nicety, whatever might involve others. The board shewed him every possible mark of indul∣gence, and sufficiently witnessed how much they felt for his situation. However, public justice obliged them to declare, "that Major Andre ought to be considered as a spy from the enemy; and that agreeable to the law and usage of nations, it is their opinion he ought to suffer death."</P>
<P>Several letters passed between the Gene∣rals Clinton and Washington relative to this unhappy affair; but nothing was capa∣ble of saving the unfortunate major. On the 2d of October, the tragedy was closed. The major was superior to the terrors of death; but the disgraceful mode of dying, which the usage of war had annexed to his unhappy situation, was infinitely dreadful to him. He was desirous of being indulged with a professional death, and had accordingly written, the day before, a pathetic letter, fraught with all the feelings of a man of sen∣timent
<PB N="159" REF="025347_0161_0FCD0000DAAA3F88"/>and honor, in which he requested of Gen. Washington, that he might not die on a gibbet. The general consulted his officers on the subject. Pity and esteem wrought so powerfully, that they were all for shooting him, till Greene insisted on it, that his crime was that of a common spy; that the public good required his being hanged; and that, were he shot, the generality would think there were favorable circumstances entitling him to notice and lenity. His observations convinced them that there would be an impro∣priety in granting the major's request, while tenderness prevented its being divulged.</P>
<P>When Major Andre was led out to the place of execution, as he went along he bow∣ed himself familiarly to all those with whom he had been acquainted in his confinement. —A smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude of his mind. Upon seeing the preparations at the fatal spot, he asked with some emotion, "Must I die in this manner?" He was told it was unavoid∣able. He replied "I am reconciled to my fate, but not to the mode." Soon after, re∣collecting himself, he added "it will be but a momentary pang;" and springing upon the cart, he performed the last offices to him∣self with a composure that excited the admi∣ration, and melted the hearts of all the spec∣tators. —Being told the final moment was at hand, and asked if he had any thing to say,
<PB N="160" REF="025347_0162_0FCD000241E7D2D0" MS="y"/>he answered. "Nothing but to request you will wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the world, that I die like a brave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He died universally esteemed and regre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Henry Clinton, on the 15th of Octo∣ber, 1780, in obedience to the orders sent him to prosecute the war with vigour in North Carolina and Virginia, dispatched Gen. Leslie from New York to the bay of Chesapeak, with near 3000 choice troops. He was to co-operate with Lord Cornwallis, who was expected to be far advanced to∣wards, if not to have reached Virginia. In a few days, the fleet arrived in the bay, and the troops were landed in different parts of Virginia.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June, the French and Spanish fleets formed a junction in the West Indies. They amounted to 36 sail of the line which, with their united land forces, formed such an apparent superiority, as no∣thing in those seas or islands seemed capable of resisting; but the Spanish troops, being too much crowded on board their transports, together with the length of the voyage, the change of climate and diet, and other cir∣cumstances, a most mortal and contagious disorder was generated, which first infected their own seamen, and at length spread, though not with so fatal an effect, through the French fleet and land forces. Besides the great mortality on the passage, the Spa∣niards landed 1200 sick on their first arrival
<PB N="162" REF="025347_0164_0FCD00061DB88D10"/>at Dominique, and a much greater number afterwards at Gaudaloupe and Martinico. Thus the spirit of enterprize was damped, and some part of their strength diminished.</P>
<P>In the month of September, Mr. Laurens was taken on his way from congress to Hol∣land, on the banks of Newfoundland. A packet of papers being thrown over-board, and not sinking suddenly, was saved by the boldness and dexterity of an English sailor, and most of them were recovered from the effects of the water On his arrival in England, he was committed, upon a charge of high treason, as a state prisoner to the Tower, under an order signed by the three secretaries of sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> By the medium of his papers, administration came to the know∣ledge of the eventual treaty of amity and commerce between America and Holland.</P>
<P>In consequence of this discovery, strong remonstrances were made to the States Gene∣ral; but, as no satisfactory answer was re∣turned, Sir Joseph Yorke received orders to withdraw from the Hague; and, on the 20th of December, general reprisals were issued against the ships, goods, and subjects, of the States General.</P>
<P>On the 12th of January, 1781, General Greene's troops consisted of about 1110. The next day, Col. Lee's partizan legion arrived from the northward, consisting of about 100 horsemen, well mounted, and 120
<PB N="163" REF="025347_0165_0FCD0007834E9690"/>infantry; and on the 13th the legion was detached on a secret expedition. They pushed on for Georgetown, where they sur∣prised several officers, and took them pri∣soners Major Irwin, and many more of the garrison were killed; but the principal part fled to the fort, which Lee was not in a condition to besiege. While this enterprize was carrying on, the enemy aimed a blow at Morgan, who was advised by Greene not to risque too much.</P>
<P>Gen. Leslie, in compliance with his or∣ders, left Virginia, and arrived at Charles∣town, and joined Lord Cornwallis, who wished to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Gen. Morgan from his sta∣tion and to deter the inhabitants from join∣ing him. The execution of this business was entrusted to Lieut. Col. Tarleton, who was detached with about 1100 men for that purpose. On the 17th of January, Tarleton came up with Morgan, when an action com∣menced, which terminated much to the dis∣advantage of Tarle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</P>
<P>Tarleton was very much censured for his conduct in this battle, which he was supposed to have lost by his un-officer like impetuo∣sity. Lord Cornwallis, with the expecta∣tions of regaining the prisoners, and demo∣lishing Morgan's corps, instantly concluded on a pursuit, which Morgan was aware of, and took his measures accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="025347_0166_0FCD000944562738" MS="y"/>
On the 31st of January, Greene suc∣ceeded Morgan in the command of the southern army, when a kind of military race commenced between the pursuing British and the fleeing Americans; but Greene got off before Cornwallis could overtake him.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis, being afterwards con∣vinced from Greene's movements, that he intended to venture an engagement, on the 14th of May sent off his baggage under a proper escort, and the next morning at day∣break, marched with the remainder of his army, amounting to about 2400 men, chief∣ly troops grown veterans in victory, either to meet Greene on the way, or attack him in his encampment.</P>
<P>The battle took place near Guilford court-house; and after a hard struggle of near two hours, the Americans retreated in good or∣der to the Reedy Fork, and crossed the river, about three miles from the field of action. Greene lost his artillery, and two ammuni∣tion waggons, the greatest part of the horses being killed before the retreat began.</P>
<P>In the month of February, reprisals hav∣ing been commenced against the Dutch, Rodney and Vaughan received instructions from Great Britain to direct their views to the reduction of the Dutch island of St. Eustatia. The British fleet and army in∣stantly appeared there, and surrounded it with a great force. Rodney and Vaughan
<PB N="165" REF="025347_0167_0FCD000B60943D90"/>sent a peremptory summons to the governor, to surrender the island and its dependencies within an hour, accompanied with a threat, that if any resistance was made, he must abide the consequences. Mons. de Graaff. totally ignorant of the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, could scarcely believe the officer, who delivered the sum∣mons, to be serious. He returned for an∣swer, that being utterly incapable of making any defence, he must of necessity surrender, only recommending the town and inhabitants to the clemency of the British commanders. The weal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of the place excited the astonish∣ment of the conquerors, the whole insland seemed to be one great magazine. All the storehouses were filled with various com∣modities, and the very beach was covered with hogsheads of sugar and tobacco. The value was estimated considerably above three millions sterling. But this was only a part; for above 150 vessels of all denominations, many of them richly laden, were captured in the bay, exclusive of a Dutch frigate of 38 guns, and five smaller. The neighboring small isles of St Martin and Saba were redu∣ced in the same manner.</P>
<P>Rodney being informed, that a fleet of about 30 large ships, all richly laden, with sugar and other West India commodities, had sailed from Eustatia for Holland just be∣fore his arrival, under convoy of a flag ship of
<PB N="166" REF="025347_0168_0FCCDB881DF284E8"/>60 guns, he dispatched the Monarch and Panther, with the Sybil frigate in pursuit of them. These soon overtook the convoy, when the Dutch admiral refusing to strike his col∣ours, and all remonstrances proving ineffec∣tual, a short engagement took place between his ship, the Mars and the Monarque. He died bravely in defence of his ship, when she instantly struck, and the whole convoy was taken.</P>
<P>The keeping of Dutch colours flying at Eustatia, rendered it for some time a decoy to French, Dutch, and American vessels, a considerable number of which fell accord∣ingly into the hands of the conquerors with∣out trouble.</P>
<P>Preparations began to be made, on the 21st of June, for the army under Gen. Washington to take the field The Amer∣icans marched towards White Plains, where they were joined by the French troops under Rochambeau.</P>
<P>Sir George Rodney, in consequence of in∣formation concerning the French fleet un∣der the Count de Grasse, detached the Ad∣mirals Sir Samuel Hood and Drake, with seventeen sail of the line, to cruise off Fort Royal for the purpose of intercepting him. On the 28th of April, some of Sir Samuel's headmost ships returned hastily in sight, and with signals announced the appearance of a superior fleet, and a numerous convoy, to
<PB N="167" REF="025347_0169_0FCD000DC1B94CA8"/>the windward of Point Salines. The ad∣miral made a signal for a general chace to windward, and at night it was determined by the admirals to continue the line a-head, so that getting as much as possible to wind∣ward, they might close in with Fort Royal at day-light, and cut off the enemy from the harbour.</P>
<P>In the morning the French appeared, their convoy keeping close in with the land, while Count de Grasse drew up his fleet in a line of battle for their protection. Admiral Hood used every manaeuvre to bring him to action; but he being to windward, and so having the choice, preferred a long shot distance. A partial engagement ensued. The van and the nearest ships, in the centre of the Bri∣tish, were exposed to a long and heavy weight of fire, in their struggles to close the French, and get to the windward; but suf∣fered principally in their masts, hulls, and rigging. The action lasted about three hours, when Admiral Hood perceiving, that not one shot in ten of the French reached, and that his attempts to gain the wind were fruitless, ceased firing, and the British fleet bore away for Antigua.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the transactions un∣der Lord Cornwallis. One great object of the British force was the establishment of a strong post and place of arms, and such as might render them perfectly masters of Che∣sapeak
<PB N="168" REF="025347_0170_0FCD000F8533BDC8" MS="y"/>bay, and herefore they repaired to York Town and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncester.</P>
<P>The French an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>can armies conti∣nued their mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> northward, till they arrived at the head of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>k; and within an hour after they received an express from Count de Grasse, with the joyful account of his arrival and situation. By the 15th of September, all the troops were arrived and landed at Williamsburgh, and preparations were made with all possible dispatch for put∣ting the army in a situation to move down towards York town.</P>
<P>On the 30th of September, Lord Corn∣wallis was closely invested in York Town. The trenches were opened by the combined armies on the 6th of October, at 600 yards distance from Cornwallis's works. On the 9th they opened their batteries, and conti∣nued firing all night, without intermission: The next morning the French opened their batteries on the left, and a tremendous roar of cannon and mortars was continued for six or eight hours without ceasing.</P>
<P>The French and Americans continued to carry on the siege with great success On the 16th their several batteries were covered with near 100 pieces of heavy ordnance; while the British works were so destroyed that they could scarcely show a single gun. Thus was Lord Cornwallis reduced to the necessity of preparing for a surrender, or of
<PB N="169" REF="025347_0171_0FCD0013790C5308"/>attempting an escape. He determined upon the latter. Boats were prepared under dif∣ferent pretences, for the reception of the troops by ten at night, in order to pass them over to Gloucester-Point. The arrange∣ments were made with the utmost secrecy. The intention was to abandon the baggage, and to leave a detachment behind to capitu∣late for the town's people, and for the sick and wounded, his lordship having already prepared a letter on the subject, to be deli∣vered to Gen. Washington after his depar∣ture. The first embarkation had arrived at Gloucester Point, and the greater part of the troops were already landed, when the wea∣ther, which was before moderate and calm, instantly changed to a most violent storm of wind and rain The bouts with the remain∣ing troops were all driven down the river, and the design of passing over was not only en∣tirely frustrated, but the absence of the boats rendered it impossible to bring back the troops from Gloucester. Thus weakened and divided, the army was in no small dan∣ger. However, the boats returned, and the troops were brought back in the course of the forenoon with very little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss.</P>
<P>Things were now hastening to a period, which could be no longer protracted; for the British works were sinking under the weight of the French and American artillery. All hopes of relief from New York were over,
<PB N="170" REF="025347_0172_0FCD00156D116E08"/>and the strength and spirits of the royal army were broken down and exhausted by their constant and unremitting fatigue. Matters being in this sinuation on the 17th of Oc∣tober, Lord Cornwallis sent out a flag with a letter to Gen. Washington, requesting a cessation of arms for twenty four hours, and that commissioners might be appointed for digesting the terms of capitulation. Com∣missioners were accordingly appointed; and on the side of the allies, were Vise. de Noailles, and Lieut. Col. Laurens, whose father was in close confinement in the Tower of London, while the son was drawing up articles, by which an English nobleman and a British army became prisoners.</P>
<P>On the 19th of October, the posts of York Town and Gloucester were surren∣dered. The honour of marching out with colours flying, which had been denied to Gen. Lincoln, was now refused to Lord Cornwallis, and Lincoln was appointed to receive the submission of the royal army at York Town, precisely in the same way his own had been conducted about eighteen months before. The troops that surrendered prisoners exceeded 7000; but so great was the number of sick and wounded, that there were only 3800 capable of doing duty. The officers and soldiers retained their baggage and effects. Fifteen hundred seamen shared the same fate as the garrison. The Gauda∣loupe
<PB N="171" REF="025347_0173_0FCD0017158EC898"/>frigate of 24 guns, and a number of transports, were surrendered to the conquer∣ors. About twenty transports had been sunk or burnt during the siege. The land forces became prisoners to congress; but the sea∣men and ships were assigned to the French admiral. The Americans obtained a fine train of artillery, consisting of 75 brass ord∣nance, and 69 iron cannon, howitzers, and mortars.</P>
<P>On the 24th of October, a fleet destined for the relief of Lord Cornwallis arrived off the Chesapeak; but, on receiving the news of his surrender, they returned to New York. The fleet consisted of 25 ships of the line, two fifties, and eight frigates. When they appeared off the Chesapeak, the French made no manner of movement, though they had 36 ships of the line, being perhaps satisfied with their present success, Every argument and persuasion was used with the Count de Grasse to induce him to aid the combined army in an operation against Charlestown; but the advanced sea∣son, the orders of his court, and his own engagements to be punctual to a certain time, fixed for his suture operations, prevented his compliance. His instructions had fixed his departure on the 15th of October, and he had already exceeded that time. On the 27th the troops under the Marquis St. Simon began to embark for the West Indies, and
<PB N="172" REF="025347_0174_0FCD001802FBCB40"/>about the 5th of November de Grasse sailed from the Chesapeak.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 27th of November, the king of England went to the house of peers, and opened the sessions of parliament. Warm debates took place on account of the ruin∣ous manner in which the American war was continued; but Lord North and his party, who thought they had not yet carried things far enough, maintained a considerable ma∣jority in the house of commons. Mr. Burke had made several motions, relative to the re∣lease of Mr. Laurens from the Tower. However, at length, Mr. Laurens was brought before Lord Mansfield, on the last day of the vear, in consequence of an order from the secretary of state, and was dis∣charged upon certain conditions.</P>
<P>The naval force of France and Spain in the West Indies, in the month of February, 1782, amounted to 60 ships of the line, and their land forces when joined would have formed a considerable army. Jamaica had no more than six incomplete battal ons of regular troops and the militia of the island to defend it; and therefore in case of at∣tack, must have been soon conquered. The arrival of Sir George Rodney with twelve sail of the line at Barbadoes, and his subse∣quent junction with Sir Samuel Hood's
<PB N="174" REF="025347_0176_0FCD001BECC97828"/>squadron, together with the arrival of three ships of the line from England a few days af∣terwards, perhaps providentially saved Ja∣maica from falling into the hands of the ene∣my. The English fleet at St. Lucia amount∣ing to 36 ships of the line, and the force un∣der de Grasse at Martinico to 34. The metal of the French is always heavier than that of the English, in equal rates, so that in this point the French had the advantage.</P>
<P>The van of the British fleet was com∣manded by Sir Samuel Hood, the centre by Sir George Redney, and the rear by Admiral Sir Francis Drake. The three divisions of the French fleet were under Count de Grasse, Mons. de Vaudreuil, and Mons. de Bo∣gainville.</P>
<P>On the 8th of April, the French fleet be∣gan to turn out of Fort Royal harbor early in the morning, with a great convoy under their protection, all bound to the French or Spanish ports in Hispanicla. De Grasse, in order to avoid an encounter on his passage, meant to keep close in under the islands, till be had eluded the pursuit of the English. However their departure from the bay was so speedily communicated by signals from the frigates, and the English fleet was in such ex∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilent preparati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, that all the ships were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ar of Gross Isl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Bay by noon, and pur∣sued with the utmost expedition; so that the French saved only a few hours, by being
<PB N="175" REF="025347_0177_0FCD001E3230FBD8"/>masters of the time of departure. The English gained sight of them under Domi∣nique at night, and afterwards regulated the pursuit by signals.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, Count de Grasse formed the line of battle, and thereby af∣forded an opportunity to his convoy for pro∣ceeding on their course, while he remained to abide the consequences. The van of the English fleet first closed with the French centre, while the English centre and rear were becalmed. The action commenced about nine o'clock on the ninth. The Bar∣fleur, Sir Samuel. Hood's own ship, had at times seven and generally three ships firing up∣on her, and none of the division escaped encountering a disproportionate force. The firm and effectual resistance with which they supported all the efforts of the enemy's su∣periority, was to the highest degree glorious. At length the leading ships of the centre were enabled to come up to their assistance. These were soon followed by Sir George Rodney in the Formidable, with his seconds the Namur and the Duke, all of 90 guns: they made and supported a most tremendous sire. De Grasse now changed the nature of the action, and kept at such a distance during the remainder of the engagement, as might prevent any thing decisive happening. The rest of the English fleet coming up De Grasse withdrew his ships from the action,
<PB N="176" REF="025347_0178_0FCD001F81F17790"/>and evaded all the efforts of the English commanders for its renewal. Two of the French ships were so damaged, that they were obliged to quit the fleet, and put into Guadaloupe. On the side of the English. the Royal Oak and the Montague suffered ex∣tremely; but they were capable of being repaired at sea, so as not to be under the ne∣cessity of quitting the fleet.</P>
<P>On the 11th the French fleet weathered Guadaloupe, and gained such a distance, that the body of their fleet could only be descried from the mast-heads of the British centre, and all hopes of Sir George Rodney's com∣ing up with them seemed to be at an end. In this critical situation, one of the French ships, which had suffered in the action, was perceived, about noon, to fall off consider∣ably from the rest of the fleet to leeward. This produced signals from the English ad∣miral for a general chase, which was so vig∣orous, that the Agamemnon, and some others of the headmost of the English line, were coming up so fast with this ship that she would assuredly have been cut off before evening, had not her signals and eminent danger induced de Grasse to bear down with his whole fleet to her assistance. This movement put it out of the power of the French to avoid fighting. The pursuing English fell back into their station, and a close line was formed.—.The French also
<PB N="177" REF="025347_0179_0FCD00210DF33A60"/>prepared for battle with the greatest resolu∣tion, and the night passed in preparations on both sides.</P>
<P>About seven o'clock in the morning, of the 12th of April, the battle commenced, and was continued with unremitting fury until near the same hour in the evening. As the English came up, they ranged slowly along the French line, and close under their lee. Being so near, every shot took effect, and the French ships being so full of men, the carnage in them was prodigious. The Formidable, Admiral Rodney's ship, fired near eighty broadsides, and it may be sup∣posed the rest were not idle. The French stood and returned this dreadful fire with the utmost firmness, each side fighting, as if the the honor and fate of their country were that day to be decided.</P>
<P>Sir George Rodney in the Formidable, with his seconds the Namur and the Duke, and immediatly supported by the Canada, between twelve and one o'clock, bore di∣rectly and with full sail athwart the French line and successfully broke through, about three ships short of the centre, where Count de Grasse commanded in the Ville de Paris of 110 guns. Being followed and supported by the remainder of his division, and wear∣ing round close about the enemy, he effec∣tually seperated their line. This bold ad∣venture proved decisive. The battle lasted
<PB N="178" REF="025347_0180_0FCD00236AE08448"/>till sun-set, for the French fought with the greatest bravery.</P>
<P>The British fleet having now gained the wind of the French, their general confusion was completed. Hood's division had been long becalmed and kept out of action; but his head ships and part of his centre, as far at least as the Barfleur, which he himself commanded, came up at this juncture, and contributed to render the victory more deci∣sive. The Caesar, Glorieux, and Hector, soon struck their colours but not till after they had made the most noble defence.</P>
<P>Count de Grasse was nobly supported even after the line was broken; and the Diadem, a French 74, went down by a single broad∣side, in a generous exertion to save him. The Ville de Paris was almost reduced to a wreck, but de Grasse still held out. At length, Hood in the Barfleur approached him just at sun-set, and poured in a most destruc∣tive fire. The Ville de Paris supported all these shocks for a quarter of an hour after, when she struck to Sir Samuel Hood. It was said, that, at the time she struck, there were but three men left alive and unhurt on the upper deck, and that the Count was one of them.</P>
<P>The Caesar was unfortuna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly set on fire, and blew up in the night of the action. A lieutenant and fifty English seamen perished, with about 400 prisoners. The number of
<PB N="179" REF="025347_0181_0FCD0024B82CE7B8"/>the French slain in this engagement, and that of the ninth, was computed at three thousand and near double that number wounded. The small superiority of British ships in point of number, contributed nothing to the success of the day, as more of Hood's division than that difference amounted to, were prevented coming into action through the want of wind. The whole loss of the English, in killed and wounded in the two actions, was stated only at 1050, of which 253 were killed on the spot.</P>
<P>In the Ville de Paris were found thirty six chests of money, destined to pay the subsist∣ence of the troops in the designed attack on Jamaica. Sir Samuel Hood being sent in pursuit of the scattered enemy, on the 19th he came up and took the Jason and Caton, of 64 guns each, and two frigates.</P>
<P>Thus the French lost eight ships of the line: six were in possession of the English, one had been sunk, and the Caesar blew up after her capture. The English having join∣ed off Cape Tiberoon, and the French having no force to the windward. Sir George Rodney proceeded with the disabled ships and pri∣zes to Jamaica, as well for their repair, as the greater security of the Island, should the combined fleet still venture upon the prosecu∣tion of their former design. Sir Samuel Hood was left with about 25 ships of the
<PB N="180" REF="025347_0182_0FCD00263B806FE8"/>line to keep the sea, and watch the motions of the enemy.</P>
<P>Let us now return to North America, where all parties seemed to be heartily tired of the war. On the 5th of May, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, and on the 7th he wrote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Gen. Washington, and sent him some public papers, that his excellency might learn from them, the disposition that prevailed in the government and people of Great Britain, relative to the making of a peace with America.</P>
<P>The British administration having resolved upon abandoning all offensive operations in America, the scheme of evacuating all the weakest posts in the United States was adopt∣ed. Accordingly, on the 11th of July Sa∣vannah was evacuated, and the Americans im∣mediately took possession of it, the works and town being left perfect.</P>
<P>On the 14th of December, Gen. Leslie, who commanded at Charleston completed the embarkation of his troops on his quitting that town. Gen. Wayne, with the legion and light infantry, had been before their works for several days, by order of Gen. Greene. It was hinted to him from Gen. Leslie, through a certain medium, that if they were permitted to embark without interruption, every care should be taken for the preserva∣tion of the town. Wayne was directed to accede to the proposal, the British also agree∣ing

<PB N="181" REF="025347_0184_0FCD002A1C9E56F8"/>not to fire on the town after getting on board. The conditions being fully understood by both parties, Charlestown was evacua∣ted and possessed without the least confu∣sion, the American advance following close on the British rear. The governor was con∣ducted into his capital the same day; the civ∣il police established the day following, and on the third the town was opened for business. On the 17th the British crossed the bar, and went to sea.</P>
<P>Every thing now seemed to announce the approach of peace. The American commis∣sioners expedited the negociation with the ut∣most assiduity, and on the 30th of November, provisional articles were agreed upon and sign∣ed, to take effect whenever terms of peace should be finally settled with the court of France. The business was finished so privately and unex∣pectedly that the ministers and embassadors, as well as others in and about the court of Ver∣sailles, were surprised upon hearing the news.</P>
<P>We must not here avoid mentioning an unfortunate event, which happened at the close of the still more unfortunate American war. Ten men of war, including Count de Grasse's ships, with a large fleet of merchant. men from Jamaica suffered exceedingly by a tremendous gale of wind off Newfound∣land, on the 17th of September. The Ville de Paris and the Glorieux foundered, and only one man out of the complement of both
<PB N="182" REF="025347_0185_0FCD002B7AD3D080"/>ships escaped to tell the melancholy tale. The Hector also sunk; but being descried in time by a snow that made towards them, the crew were saved. The Ramilies went down, but her people were saved by the merchantmen in company. The Centaur was likewise lost, and all her company, except twelve, with the captain, who got into the only remaining boat. They traversed a space of near 800 miles on the Atlantic ocean, without compass or quadrant, and with a blanket for a sail. They had only two biscuits divided among them every twenty-four hours; and as much water during that space to every man, as the neck of a wine bottle broken off would hold. At the expiration of sixteen days when the last division of biscuit and water had been made, to their inexpressible joy, they discov∣ered the Portuguese island of Fayal, where they safely arrived at night, and received every assistance their melancholy situation de∣manded.</P>
<P>On the 3d of September, 1783, the defin∣itive treaties between Great Britain, France, and Spain, were signed at Versailles by the Duke of Manchester, and the plenipoten∣tiaries of said court. On the same day, the definitive treaty with Great Britain and the United States of America was also signed at Paris, by David Hartley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the British plenipotentiary, and the plenipotentiaries of the said state.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="025347_0186_0FCD002D14CF4928"/>
By the articles of this treaty, his Britannic majesty acknowledged the independence of the United States of New Hampshire, Mas∣sachusetts Bay, Rhode island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut.. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. He also relinquished all claims to the government of them, and consented to treat with them as a free and independent people: Their boun∣daries were also settled, and they were allow∣ed the liberty of fishing and drying fish as usual on the banks of Newfoundland.</P>
<P>The particulars of the treaty between Great Britain, France, and Spain will be found in our History of England, to which it more properly belongs.</P>
<P>Thus ended the unhappy American war, which added to the national debt of the mo∣ther-country one hundred and twenty mil∣lions, besides the loss of many thousands of our bravest officers, soldiers, and seamen, to the eternal infamy and disgrace of those min∣isters, who advised and carried it on, con∣trary to the general voice of the people!</P>
