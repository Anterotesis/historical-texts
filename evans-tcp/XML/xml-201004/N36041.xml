<P>Is Christ divided?—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PARTIES and divisions among the professors of Christianity have hurt and wounded the cause of religion, more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the external at∣tacks of deists and insidels, heathens and devils.— The Church of Christ, at this day, is bleeding, even unto death, by the wounds she has received from this quarter. And what renders the case of the poor afflicted Church more pitiable and deplo∣rable, is, that, while many are crying out against divisions and their sad effects, few consider at whose door the divisions lie, or who the persons
<PB N="4" REF="047065_0003_10229F6320E45190"/>are, that cause and foment them: And it often happens that the principal authors of divisions are the loudest against them.</P>
<P>Bigots of all parties cry out against divisions; but their ideas are very contracted;—for they care not how much the body of Christ is rent, or divided, if they can but keep one of his <HI>fingers,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I may be allowed the expression, whole and en∣tire to themselves. Thus while many lament the want of <HI>unity,</HI> they mean unity in some <HI>favourite part</HI> only, and not in the <HI>whole.</HI> If <HI>this part</HI> be in a thriving way, they have no concern for other parts, but rather feel a secret satisfaction in hear∣ing that they are crumbling to pieces,—and this often becomes a very agreeable topic of conversa∣tion.—I wish professors would impartially examine themselves, and see if they do not find too much of <HI>this</HI> in their own breasts, notwithstanding all their pretended desires of love and unity.</P>
<P>And should any man, being grieved at the dis∣tractions of <HI>Zion,</HI> and possessed with a spirit of mo∣deration and peace, come forward, and, with a lenient hand, attempt to close the breaches, and heal the wounds of the bleeding Church,—nothing can be more unpromising and unpopular. His prof∣fered services are very unacceptable, and he subjects himself to dreadful suspicious from every side:— Suspicious of his <HI>intention</HI>—and of his leaning more
<PB N="5" REF="047065_0004_10229F65A15FEA30"/>to <HI>this</HI> part than to <HI>that.</HI> Dreadful insinuations are thrown out, as if he was inimical to this <HI>part</HI> or <HI>that,</HI>—and grave cautions are given against pay∣ing any regard to what he says, or even giving him a hearing:—his doctrine is poisonous—it sa∣vours too much of <HI>Calvinisin,</HI> says one,—and too much of <HI>Arminianisin,</HI> says another:—and, per∣haps, the more effectually to counteract, and hin∣der the salutary effects of the healing balm, his character is attacked, and the soundness of his re∣ligion called greatly into question.—And all this time the same cry is kept up against divisions and their sad effects.—Is not such a conduct just as absurd, as if a man should set a house on fire, and furiously rail against any one, that would attempt to quench it, and yet execrate, and vehemently bawl out against all house-burners? But the truth is, that men of <HI>this</HI> bigoted and contracted cast care not whose houses are burnt, <HI>so their own eggs are roasted.</HI></P>
<P>Contentions and divisions had grievously infest∣ed the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and St. Paul wrote this epistle to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> for the purpose of putting an end to them. Therefore, after some introduc∣tion, he presses into the body of his design, by ad∣dressing the Church in these pathetic words:— <Q>How I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the
<PB N="6" REF="047065_0005_10229F672CFE0548"/>same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</Q> He solemnly charges them to cultivate a spirit of LOVE and UNITY in the Church, and to avoid all party distinctions and party names, which are pregnant with mischief,—naturally tending to contract the mind, stir up strife, and confine cha∣rity within the narrow limits of a very small circle, and thus defeat and destroy the very design of Christianity in the world. Such baleful consequen∣ces are sure to take place, when one and auother are saying, <HI>I am of Paul,—and I of Apollos,—and I of Cophas,</HI> or Peter,—<HI>and I of Christ.</HI>—Thus it was at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and a partiality, in favor of this or that preacher, so much prevailed, and gave rise to such warm contentions and bitterness,—that, I dare say, they might wish to have their separato assemblies,—and that some would not go to hear <HI>Paul,</HI> had he preached within 100 yards of their door. They might not like his close, searching doctrine—and to hear human nature so degraded, and see it drawn in such black lines, as <HI>Paul</HI> was wont to do;—nor to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear so much about faith, and righteousness imputed—and their own works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from all share of merit in point of justifi∣cation. These, you know, were favourite topics with that great Apostle.—<HI>Apelles</HI> was their man—
<PB N="7" REF="047065_0006_10229F69AC1EAD80"/>they would go any distance to hear him. O, he was a sweet preacher—his oratorial powers were so charming, that he might be unto them <HI>as a ve∣ry lovely song of one that had a pleasant voice.</HI>—Some would hear neither Paul or Apollos but would turn out in all weathers, by night or by day—be the season hot or cold, wet or dry, to hear <HI>Peter</HI>—they were pleased with his plain, blunt manner of address—and besides he seemed, at times, to countenance ceremonies and the works of the law more than Paul did.—Others again had no ear for any but <HI>Paul</HI>—for he had the cha∣racter of a first-rate scholar, and a masterly rea∣soner;—they were for none of your <HI>fisherman</HI>—they must have one brought up at the seat of the <HI>Muses,</HI> or at the feet of some <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> or he would not do for them.—And there were others who were for no preacher at all,—they saw no ne∣cessity of going to hear any body—they could <HI>stay at home, and say their prayers, and do as well. I am of Christ,</HI> was their language.</P>
<P>Thus, or, perhaps, to the same purpose, they went on rapidly, to the great disgrace of Christi∣anity, the distraction of the Church, and the hurt of their own souls.—Against such proceedings the Apostle pungently remonstrates, as a dangerous rook—the bane of charity, and the ruin of the Christian Church.—<HI>Is Christ divided?</HI> says he.
<PB N="8" REF="047065_0007_10229F6B39387FA0"/>This is his first argument to show the impropriety and absurdity of church divisions. The argument stands thus—<HI>Is Christ divided?</HI>—Every body will answer, no. Then the natural conclusion, from the premises, is, Therefore, "his members should not be divided."—Christ is the head of the Church, and all his people are the members o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that one head,—the constituent parts of Christ's body. And if there should be no <HI>schism</HI> in the natural body— no contention among its members,—is it not equal∣ly unnatural and pernicious, that there should be any <HI>schism,</HI> rent, or contention among the mem∣bers of that <HI>mystical body,</HI> the church, of which Christ is the universal head? The Apostle makes use of the same reasoning, in the 12th chapter of this epistle, when he reproves the <HI>Corinthiant</HI> for the divisions, which had arisen among them, from the diversity of their spiritual gifts. "For as the body is one," says he, "and hath members; and all the members of that one body, being ma∣ny, are one body; so also is Christ."</P>
<P>In discoursing on the subject, I purpose,</P>
<P N="1">I. To shew who the members of Christ are, that constitate his body, the church.</P>
<P N="2">II. Shew that, in reality, there is but one church of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d, in all the world, which is com∣monly called the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Cat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> Church.</HI></P>

I. I am to show who the members of Christ are, which constitute his body, the church.— That all christians are members of the church of Christ, is, I believe, a matter of no controversy at all.—New men are called christians, because they are the disciples of Christ, and, by a living faith, are united to him, and have communion with him, both in his merit and spirit. This is the case of all real christians, and in consequence of which, "they have put o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the old man, and are renewed in the spirit of their mind, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the new man, which after God is renewed in righte∣ousness and true ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>."—On else, men are called christians because they presess these things, and seen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by their lives, to be what they do pro∣fess,—though they may be deslit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te of an internal change and the vital <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their hearts.—The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are both just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ied and sanctified; and <HI>these</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the mythical body of Christ, and are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of his church, not only as visible, but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>—The latter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the church, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> by men, who have neither authority, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the heart.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> judgment. In ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging
<PB N="10" REF="047065_0009_10229F712D209CC0"/>of church members, the <HI>profession</HI> and <HI>life</HI> must both be considered, because no man is to be esteem∣ed a christian, who does not profess all the <HI>essen∣tials</HI> of christianity. Such as profess some parts of christianity, and leave out, and deny other es∣sential parts, are not, in fact professors of Christi∣anity, and consequently are not members of the church as <HI>visible.</HI></P>
<P>But some might be willing to ask, what are the essentials of Christianity,—and what is necessary for a man to profess, and be, in order to his being a member of Christ's Church?—<HI>This</HI> question may be answered in a few words.—Every man, who so believeth in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, that his faith puri∣fieth his heart, and worketh by obedient love, is a true Christian, and consequently a member of the Church of Christ, as <HI>visible</HI> and <HI>invisible.</HI>—But to render this matter more plain, I shall express myself a little more full on the <HI>essentials</HI> of Christi∣anity and the characteristics of church members. Every man, then, is a church member, who so believes in God, as to take him for his Lord and God—his Creator, Ruler and Governor,—his portion, his happiness and ultimate end:—that so believes in Jesus Christ, as to receive and rely on him, as his only Redeemer and God-man Media∣tor, who has fulfilled all righteousness for us men,
<PB N="11" REF="047065_0010_10229F73ADB67FD8"/>and for our salvation—and was <HI>obedient unto death, even the death of the cross</HI>—suffering the just for the unjust—and made himself a sacrisice of attone∣ment for the sins of men—by which obedience and suffering he hath purchased pardon and grace, holiness and heaven for poor, guilty and wretch∣ed sinners, who had incurred the displeasure of God—lost the divine image, and forfeited all right and title to life eternal:—that, having fi∣nished the work he came to do, he rose from the dead—ascended into heaven, where he reigns as Lord of the Church, and intercedes with the Fa∣ther in behalf of his people;—and hath given out laws, which we must obey;—and, at the last day, he will come again and raise the dead—cite all mankind to the bar of his judgment seat, and will then judge the world in righteousness, and pass sentence on <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>sinners</HI>—adjudging <HI>those</HI> to everlasting life, and <HI>these</HI> to everlasting punish∣ment. And moreover, that he believes in, and takes the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> for his sanctifier—and to en∣lighten, quicken and purify—and, in a word, he believes that the Scriptures were given by <HI>his</HI> holy inspiration—sealed by his works and mira∣cles—and, consequently, that they contain the true and faithful words of God."</P>
<P>What I have just now enumerated comprize the essentials of the Christian religion,—and who∣soever
<PB N="12" REF="047065_0011_10229F762F1E1688"/>professeth these things, professeth the essen∣tials of Christianity. And he that not only profes∣seth, but hath also known the transforming power of these truths his own heart, and his profession is attended with seriousness and sobriety—holiness of life and conversation—a diligent use of all the means of grace, and the performance of all the known duties of religion,—piery toward God, and justice and mercy toward men—and a desire to know more of God and his holy will, that his obe∣dience may be more perfect, and himself more dead to the world and sin—more alive to God, and more conformed to his holy image:—if he lives a life of self-denial—takes up the cross, and is daily endea∣vouring to crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts:—He, I say, that so believes, and walks, is a Christian, both in faith and practice,—is a living member of Christ's body the Church, and in a state of salvation.</P>
<P>And he that professeth all this, professeth him∣self to be a Christian: And though he may not have that living faith, which savingly unites him to Christ—purifies the heart, and constitutes an <HI>invisible</HI> member,—yet, if his life does not noto∣riousfly contradict and nullify his profession, he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a member of the Church as <HI>visible,</HI> and must be re∣ceived as such, by the pastors of the Church, who
<PB N="13" REF="047065_0012_10229F79B30C09F8"/>are to judge only by the profession, life and con∣versation.</P>
<P>Particular <HI>modes</HI> and <HI>forms</HI> of religious worship, adopted by one or another, enter not at all into the <HI>essentials</HI> of Christianity; nor ought <HI>these</HI> to be made a bone of contention. If a man has faith in God, as reconciled to him through Jesus Christ—if he has repentance from dead works— believes in the Holy Ghost, and, by his sacred in∣fluence, is made a partaker of the divine nature, and evidences the same, as expressed above,—this man is <HI>fundamentally right,</HI> and ought by no means to be excluded from our charity.—In ex∣ternals, let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind—and make prayer and supplication to God, in that way, which he finds most profitable to himself.—If men will not endeavour to culti∣vate love and unity with one another, because one prays with a form, and another does not,—I think there is great reason to suppose, that their zeal savours more of the things of men, than the things of God.</P>
<P>But among the members of the Catholic Church, there is a great variety, in several respects. Some are babes, some are young men, and some are fa∣thers. Some are but lately converted—others have borne the burden and heat of the day. The <HI>former,</HI> being weak in grace and knowledge, must
<PB N="14" REF="047065_0013_10229F7C351F1F00"/>be fed with milk, and taught and grounded in the first principles of the doctrines of Christ;—the <HI>lat∣ter,</HI> having their senses exercised by use, must be fed with stronger meat, and carried on to matu∣rity, or perfection.—They differ much in their complexion. Though all the members of the fa∣mily resemble their heavenly Father in holiness, yet, by their complexion, they may be distinguish∣ed one from another.—Some are meek, mild and timorous;—others are more choleric and san∣guine. The <HI>former</HI> often complain of doubt, fear and difficulty;—but the latter are wont to speak in more positive strains, and appear more warm, zealous and confident.—They differ much as to spiritual health. Some are so vigorous that they seem all alive in the duties of religion, and their relish and appetite for their spiritual food, are so quick and sharp, that they go to the seve∣ral ordinances of religion and means of grace, with chearfulness and pleasure. Others have but weak stomachs, and are obliged to drag them∣selves on, especially to secret duties, and to strive hard to get down the heavenly manna.—In a word, some live much in holy peace and joy,— while others are under frequent complaints of deadness, coldness and indisposition, though they are truly tender and conscientious in all they do and say, and would not offend God, on any con∣sideration,
<PB N="15" REF="047065_0014_10229F7DC3D6C5D8"/>—while others, not a jot more conscien∣tious, and perhaps having a considerable share of misguided zeal, have few, or no complaints at all.</P>
<P>The members also differ in this, that all are not equally useful, nor have they all the same of∣fice. Some, like pillars in the house, are the supports of the spiritual building, in the places where they live. Others can scarcely stand on their own legs, or take one step further than they are supported and guided by their brethren. Some lay out themselves in administering food and phy∣sic, counsel and advice to the poor and weak mem∣bers: while others have so many maladies, that they trouble the family with their complaints and grievances.—Some are apt to teach, and are ap∣pointed pastors over the flock, to go before them, tend them, and give their portion of food in due season—rightly dividing the word, and sorting the provision according to the several ages and circumstances of all under their care. Upon the whole, God hath set the members in the body, every one as it hath pleased him, and in such or∣der and subserviency one to another, that <HI>the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no nood of thee, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</HI> —Having shown who the members of Christ are, which constitute his body, the Church, both <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> I proceed</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="047065_0015_10229F8043928148"/>
II. To shew that the Church of Christ, in all the world, is but one, which is commonly called the Holy Catholic Church.</P>
<P>This point may be proved in few words. It is strongly implied in the words of the text, and is pretty clearly asserted in the words already quoted, from 1 Cor. xii. 12. <Q>For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many are one body; so also is Christ.</Q>—If by the body here is meant the Church, as it is universally understood, then it clearly follows, that all christians, professing, be∣lieving and acting according to the character drawn under the first head, being members of that one body, of which Christ is the one undivided head, are all constituent parts of one and the same church; and consequently, in the strictest sense of the word, there can be but one church. Whe∣ther such christians live in <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> they constitute one and the same bo∣dy. They have all one God, the fountain of their being and the source of their felicity—one Father, who has reconciled himself to them, by Jesus Christ, and them to him, by the renovation of their nature, and shedding abroad his love in their heart, by the Holy Ghost.—<Q>They are all the children of God, by faith in Jesus Christ.</Q> They have all one Redeemer, Saviour and Medi∣ator,
<PB N="17" REF="047065_0016_10229F83E66817A0"/>who is the head sovereign and centre of them all;—they are all built on one foundation, and Jesus Christ, the chief <HI>conner stone,</HI> binds and con∣nects all in one; and, by him, is the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted. Jesus Christ is the <HI>chief corner stone</HI> laid in <HI>Zion,</HI> on which all true believers are built up into one <HI>spiritual house</HI> —By his righteousness are they all freely justified —by his obedience are they all made righteous, and by his spirit are all governed and sanctified.— They are actuated by the same divine Spirit,— and by this one Spirit are all baptized into one bo∣dy,—they all drink into one Spirit, and by that one Spirit have all access to the Father, through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>The church is <HI>one,</HI> as all the members have one and the same chief end, which is, to glorify God and enjoy him for ever.—They are one in affec∣tion and desire. Sin is the object of their hatred— the displeasure of God is the object of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: while God and Christ, holiness and heaven, are the objects of their love, hope and desire. Thus they unite, with one heart and soul, in the same objects.—They all li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e under the same divine government, and are subject to the same <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> which is called <HI>the law of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.—the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>— the law of Uberty</HI>—and <HI>the law of Christ.</HI>—They are all in one and the same <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> are
<PB N="18" REF="047065_0017_10229F86650D2350"/>unanimous in renouncing the devil, the world and the flesh—in devoting themselves to God, as their Father—to Jesus Christ, as their Saviour —and to the Holy Ghost, as their sanctifier,— and in living in obedience to all the known and essential duties of the gospel.—They love one ano∣ther, and pray for the prosperity of the whole body. Their conversation is in heaven, and the service of God is their employ.—And, at last, when they have finished their course, they shall obtain the same crown of glory, join in the same gene∣ral assembly and church of Christ in heaven, and praise their common Lord and Saviour, with one heart and soul and voice for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Having dispatched the doctrine, I come,</P>
<P N="3">III. To the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Under the first head, I shewed what a man must profess, believe and be, in order to constitute him a member of the christian church, as <HI>visible</HI> and <HI>invisible.</HI> He, that denies the <HI>essentials</HI> of christianity, is not a member of Christ's church at all.—If he profess all the essentials of the christian religion, and yet deny them in practice, by living
<PB N="19" REF="047065_0018_10229F87F0DD8198"/>in the commission of any sin or sins forbidden there∣by,—or in the omission of any duty or duties, therein commanded, and plainly enjoined, he can be no member of the Holy Catholic church, be∣cause it is manifest that he is an unholy man. Such an one is not even a visible member. And should a man profess to believe all the articles of the christian faith, and habitually maintain an ex∣ternal conduct, in a good measure conformable to his profession, though such an one must be ac∣counted a member of the <HI>Catholic Church</HI> as <HI>visible,</HI> yet he may be no member of the church as real and <HI>invisible.</HI> A man may be <HI>blameless, as touching the righteousness of the law,</HI> and externals of religion, and be no real christian, because we find from scripture, <HI>that men may have a name, that they live, while they are dead,</HI> and a <HI>form of godliness with∣out the power thereof.</HI></P>
<P>But such as profess and believe with that faith, which purifies the heart and works by love, and unites to Christ mystically, and are thus made par∣takers of his blood and righteousness, and the life∣giving and sanctifying virtues of the Holy Ghost, derived from him, the head of vital influence, as the branches derive sap from the vine;—such are not only justified and pardoned, by faith in the Redeemer, but are inwardly renewed in the spi∣rit of their mind,—are holy in heart and life, and

<P>If this state of the case be just, then, alas! how sew members, even visible, hath the church among us?—How many profess no religion at all? And while the generality profess to believe the essenti∣als of christianity, at least do not deny them,—yet do they not live in swearing, lying, drunkenness, uncleanness, and such like,—or in the omission of the plain duties of religion?—And are there not many such among you? Let every one lay his han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l on his breast, and say, <HI>Lord is it I?</HI> And what must be the consequence of such a conduct?—You pro∣fess a religion which daily and hourly condemns you; and your profession of it will only aggravate your final condemnation at the bar of God, and render your everlasting torment more intolerable —a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less, according to it, dictates, you, now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣pont and be converted that your sins may be blot∣ted out.—O sinners,—it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for you, <HI>at that awful day.</HI></P>
<P>But may a man not only profess, the essentials of the gospel, but sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke all known sin, and go in a round of all known duty, and yet be no more than a visible member, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>?</HI>—What then must you think of your case, O ye profane neglecters of God, and the duties and ordinances of religion? Must not hell and destruction be
<PB N="21" REF="047065_0020_10229F8D30D61340"/>your portion, if you live and die in your present state?—And ought not this consideration to in∣duce every one of us to look inwardly to the foundation of our religion, and examine into the reality of it and see whether it will stand the test.—</P>
<P>And, now, who among you are the living mem∣bers of the Christian Church, and who not?— Push the question home, and bring the matter to some certain issue. Be assured, this is a matter of no trifling importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. I may be told, that you are members of the <HI>Old Episcopal Church,</HI> and that you do not pretend to so much religion as other professions do.—I tell you there is but one Church, and the essentials of religion in doctrine and holiness of heart and life are the same in all the members. This I have already shewn. Therefore, whatever you may say, or whatever custom may call you, while you continue in the practice of sin, you are, in reality, no members of the <HI>Christian</HI> Church. <HI>This Church,</HI> as you have heard, is that one body, of which Christ is the head, and all the members thereof are holy. And though, unfortunately, the pro∣fessors of Christianity have been ranged under va∣rious denominations, yet each of these will dis∣own you, while you continue to act inconsistent with the requisitions of the gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="047065_0021_10229F90A69C4ED0"/>
Here I cannot but take notice of a very ill∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> reduction, which is often cast on the <HI>Old Church.</HI> To wit, <Q>That most of her members are <HI>drunkards</HI> or <HI>swearers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars, gamesters, re∣vellers, debauchees,</HI> and such like.</Q>—Be not de∣ceived my friends, <HI>such</HI> are no members of any Christian Church.—But you would say, that you have known such admitted to the Lord's table in the old church. I answer, that to admit such is ex∣ceeding wrong; but the Church is not the author of the wrong. For where such are admitted, the fault lies, either with the <HI>sons of Eli,</HI> or, which is most probable, with the very persons, who make the objection. For had they, instead of making a schisin and salling off into a divided party, done their duty, by admonishing the offender, and bring∣ing forward a proper information against cor∣rupt members, that they might be cut off, the ground of the objection would, probably, not have ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I most heartily concur, with this difference only—that, where∣as he recommends it to the <HI>Methodists</HI> in particular.

<PB N="23" REF="047065_0022_10229F9233C5E030"/>True, in this country, the Church of England, as the Protestant Episcopal Church was once called, was the established religion; and, perhaps, ninety nine out of a hundred knew little of any other de∣nomination, and in this church their children were baptized, and, by custom, they were called <HI>Churchmen.</HI> But the generality, when they grew up, joined themselves, in reality, to no church at all; but followed, as they now do, the way of their own hearts, and walked in the sight of their own eyes. And is this peculiar to any particular de∣nomination? Your own observation will inform you that it is not. The truth of the case is this, that no man ever was, nor ever will be a true member of Christ's church by <HI>natural generation;</HI> but he is made so by <HI>spiritual regeneration,</HI>—or being born of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it so that the church of Christ is <HI>one,</HI> and that all true Christians are members of but <HI>one body,</HI> of which <HI>Christ</HI> is the head? What pity is it then, that there should be so little love and for∣bearance
<PB N="24" REF="047065_0023_10229F94FAE24F70"/>among the professors of <HI>his</HI> name, and so much animosity among his members?—What signifies all professions without love?—<Q>Ah! this is right, <HI>says one,</HI> and sure I am, <HI>says he,</HI> I love all the people of God.</Q>—But who are they? Here is the point, <Q>O <HI>says one,</HI> if ever I was among the people of God in my life, they are the <HI>Baptists.</HI></Q> And another, <Q>If ever I was among the people of God, they are the <HI>Methodists;</HI></Q>— and so on. Now, if you can search to the bot∣tom, you would find the love of many great pro∣fessors centring in <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> party, and confined within the contracted circle of such as do as they do, say as they say, and think as they think; and that in some particular matters very unessential, and hardly countenanced by the word of God. Now, <HI>if you love them that love you, what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the same?</HI> This is no proof at all that you have any Christian love. Where there is a combination, or a same∣ness in principles and practices, the worst of men, even horse-thieves, are fond of one another.—</P>
<P><Q>This is the truth <HI>says one,</HI> and I am sure, I love people of all professions, who are Christi∣ans.</Q> —But take care,—don't you find it hard to think any man a Christian, who is not of your party?—Bigotry has a great tendency to make men <HI>hard of belief,</HI> in this respect. And while
<PB N="25" REF="047065_0024_10229F969F3D21A0"/>those, possest of it, are blind to the failings of any of their own party, they have an eagle's eye to discover the flaws of others, and a microscopic eye to magnify mole-hills into mountains.—Search and see how it stands with you, in this particu∣lar.</P>
<P>From bigotry and a party spirit it comes to pass, that we find some can give no credit to the excel∣lencies and good qualities of any, who belong not to their own division, nor to the miscarriages of any who do.—Tell them what a laborious, pun∣gent, animated, useful preacher such a man is, who belongs to a different party;—they don't seem to hear you,—they receive the account ve∣ry coldly,—and, perhaps, they will hum a tune, while you are talking, to shew they have no ear for that discourse.—And after you have done, perhaps the reply may be,—<Q>But is he not a <HI>Calvinist?</HI></Q>—Or, "Is he not an <HI>Armenian?</HI>" This is intended to obliterate, or, at least, to cast a cloud over all good qualities whatever.—And it is not unlikely, but they will hint, "That they have heard a very different story—and that one of their Brethren had <HI>mentioned something</HI>— but he did not like <HI>to say much.</HI>—However they wish he may be <HI>a good man</HI>—though they fear he has got too much of <HI>the spirit of the world.</HI>"—But if instead of good qualities, you men∣tion
<PB N="26" REF="047065_0025_10224B25DB52CBF8"/>some bad ones, or relate some fault, you catch their attention at once, and are heard with a smile of approbation.—Pause, my brethren, and see how much of this belongs to you.—I sear some of you will find yourselves very far from the Catholic love of <HI>that Christian,</HI> who, in reality, loves all the children or people of God of every profession.</P>
<P>Christian love is universal. And we may pre∣tend to Christianity as much as we please, yet we do but deceive ourselves, if it does not open our hearts, in love, to all professing christians as such, and all <HI>saints</HI> as <HI>saints,</HI> according to their various degrees of amiableness. And that love and desire of unity, which is not <HI>universal,</HI> has, in it, a strong tincture of <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>schism.</HI> He, that loveth one party, and not the rest, falls vastly short of loving all mankind;—and he, that is united but to a part, must of consequence be divided from the whole.</P>
<P N="4">4. From what has been said, we may learn how much it is the duty of all christians to promote uni∣ty among all professors in general, and in their own neighbour hoods in particular; and to avoid all discord and divisions, and whatever tends there∣to.—Unity, in the body of Christ, constitutes its <HI>health, ease, quiet</HI> and <HI>prosperity.</HI> But <HI>smart, pain, inquietude</HI> and <HI>wounds,</HI> are the native effects of
<PB N="27" REF="047065_0026_10229F9C99C8C0F8"/>impenitence;—his bowels of compassion yearn over you:—he expostulates with you, and asks, <HI>why will ye die, O louse of Israel?</HI>—He offers you pardon for all your sins,—to help and guard you to eternal glory; and to invest you with that in∣heritance, which was purchased with his own precious blood.—And, O will none of these things move you?—Are you determined like wicked So∣dom, to hold on your course, and follow the way of your own hearts?—</P>
<P>And is there no remedy?—Is it in vain to speak to you—Then let me turn my voice to God. Lot found favor, and by his prayer saved one little ci∣ty. And who can tell, but the ears of the Lord may be open to my prayer, while I am interce∣ding for you.—"And now, O thou fountain of mercy, have compassion on this congregation, and their souls shall live.—Open the ears and soften the hearts of these poor obstinate sinners, with whom all our warnings and intreaties have been in vain.—O Lord Jesus, thou Saviour of lost men, have mercy on these souls, in the depth of their security, presumption and misery;—and may thy blood soften and melt their hearts.—O thou Spirit of the living God, apply the remedy to <HI>those,</HI> so dearly bought; bring them to a deep sense of their danger—seize their consciences, and with a holy</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="047065_0027_10229FA011DB03B0"/>
Perhaps, one will tell me, there is not a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon earth more desirous of peace and unity in the church, than he is.—But upon what terms, pray? The true answer might be, that all men should agree to his terms, and come over to that party to which he is joined.—Such pride and self∣ishness forbid all hope of peace. The papists, no doubt, would have peace with protestants, on these terms. <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>selfishness</HI> are among the greatest enemies to the church's peace. <HI>These</HI> the devil makes use of to break the unity of christians; and he carefully watches all opportunities to throw in some bone of contention to seatter and divide the members of Christ. He will make use of the opinions and dispositions even of the godly to an∣swer this diabolical purpose. Some of these he will entangle in dangerous errors, and hereby he lays a train for blowing up animosities and warm contentions in doctrinal points. Sometimes, by means of rules for external government, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasion to excite passion and prejudice, and the contention may become so sharp, that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> are separated.</P>
<P>But one main thing, why so many, at this day, have drank so deeply into a divisive, party spirit, is, their being among, and so frequently convers∣ing with persons of a schismatic cast, who, both in private, and in public, are still blowing the coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="29" REF="047065_0028_10229FA1C11B91C0"/>of strife and contention. This is extremely dan∣gerous, especially to young persons, and such as are not well taught and grounded in the nature and doctrines of the gospel. How many are now stiff bigots, and furious for some divided party, in opposition to all others, who dreamed of no such thing, when they first became intimate with their present associates. Had they been told that such would be the effects, and that, in a little while, they would be led to forsake, and oppose even their fathers in the gospel—probably, they would have replied, with <HI>Hazael,</HI> <Q>Is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing?</Q> But after hearing and seeing those men, whom they esteem eminent∣ly pious, make it their religion and frequent prac∣tice to vilify and traduce all others as enemies to Christ and the gospel—and hearing their own side extolled as mere angels, and all others represent∣ed as of suspicious characters, or reproached and spoken against as blind, lifeless and formal—ene∣mies to the <HI>Church,</HI> or to <HI>them,</HI> as they generally call themselves the church, by way of eminence and distinction;—when they hear the principle of one, or another loaded with hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as if they were the offspring of the devil, and such like: —When this is the case, it is no wonder it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mprint a schismatical or party disposition on the minds of their hearers and admirers. Conversing
<PB N="30" REF="047065_0029_10229FA5372EA9C8"/>with such a party imbitters the mind, and natural∣ly creates uncharitableness towards all others;— and their conscience becomes so perverted and seared, that they can slander, revile, and throw out the most opprobrious speeches against any that differ from them, without any sense of <HI>guilt</HI> or <HI>shame,</HI>—nay, they will call it <HI>faithfulness,</HI> and think they are <HI>bold for God,</HI> while they are acting as contrary to the genius and design of the gospel and the law of Christ, as light is to darkness. O that you, my dear brethren, would bear with my plainness, and hear without prejudice—for be as∣sured I have no end to serve, but the good of your souls, and the peace and happiness of the Catholic church.—Whenever you hear a man extolling his own party—and vilifying others, either in plain terms, or by hints and insinuations—mark that man, and beware—take care how you catch that spirit,— for it is not the spirit of Christ, but the spirit of pride, bigotry and selfishness—yea, it is the spirit of him, who is <HI>the accuser of the brethren,</HI> and the enemy of love and peace.</P>
<P>How much better would it be, and how much mere of the spirit of Christianity would it mani∣fest, if, instead of <HI>this,</HI> christians of every denomi∣nation would be tender of the character of each other, and defend it, as long as it could be done with honor—and endeavour to cultivate a friend∣ly
<PB N="31" REF="047065_0030_10229FA6C81ACC70"/>correspondence with each other;—and if there is a diversity of sentiment, in some particular ar∣ticles, which are not <HI>essential,</HI>—why should <HI>that</HI> which is not essential in itself, be suffered to do such an <HI>essential injury,</HI> as that of tearing the body of Christ to pieces, wounding the cause of religion—and destroying the peace and happiness of its professors. What if there be a diversity in some <HI>modes</HI> of external worship, or <HI>rules</HI> of go∣vernment; —this is only the <HI>body</HI> and ought by no means to hinder our unity and agreement in the <HI>soul</HI> of religion.</P>
<P>The essentials of religion, as briefly laid down under my first head, are embraced, I believe by all persuasions—and I should think, they consti∣tute a bottom broad enough, for all Christians to stand on together—and afford a sufficient basis, for catholic unity.—Surely, those, who will not unite here, must have some other ends to serve than the peace, harmony and welfare of the <HI>Church,</HI> and the good of precious souls.</P>
<P>O could this blessed agreement, in the SOUL of religion once be permitted to take place, and prevail, its happy consequences would soon be apparent. Religion would gain credit and esteem in the earth, and force the world to say, "See how these Christians love!"—And it would not only gain credit, but influence, when
<PB N="32" REF="047065_0031_10229FA982A70808"/>its genuine tendency should manifest itself, and prevail in love and charity to all mankind.—We should hear of no more jars and contentions a∣mong its true professors, nor proscriptions of this or that preacher, who has nothing worse to be laid to his charge, than that he does not join sully to our particular party, and is not subject to our im∣mediate controul.—It would be sufficient for an union of hearts, if he fears God, and orders his conversation agreeably to the <HI>rules</HI> of the gospel of God, though he might not think proper to sub∣ject himself to every <HI>rule</HI> devised by man.</P>
<P>I have spoke the more freely on this subject, because it is well known, that during the long course of my ministry, I have never sat up as a head, or violent abettor of any party. And though I am a minister and a member of what is called the Old Church, and such I expect to live and die,—yet have I strenuously endeavored to cultivate love, affection, harmony and friendship with <HI>all</HI>—I have vindicated the characters of <HI>all,</HI> which I believed to be unjustly aspersed,—and, as far as opportunity has served, I have heard <HI>all</HI> —preached to <HI>all,</HI> and gladly joined with <HI>all,</HI> in their places of worship, in every ordinance of Christ.—But I have seen so much mischief done by bigotry and a party spirit, not only in that particular corner of the vineyard where I have
<PB N="33" REF="047065_0032_10229FAC5537ABD0"/>more statedly laboured, but elsewhere, that I thought it incumbent on me to shew the im∣propriety of these things, and point out their baneful effects—and to bear my testimony against them. And at the same time to lay down the broad and solid basis of christian <HI>love</HI> and <HI>unity</HI> in the Soul—the vitals and essentials of religion, and to invite and exhort <HI>all</HI> to lay aside all their jars, contentions, animosities and unchristian censures, and henceforth endeavour to cultivate a friendly correspondence with all,—and to imbibe a spirit of love and charity—as unbounded as the limits of the <HI>Holy Catholic Church.</HI> That God of his in∣finite mercy may render what has been said ef∣fectual to subserve the design and end intended, I beg for Christ's sake, Amen.</P>
