<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly and Impartial <HI>Reader.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope upon thy deliberate consideration and reflection, upon the Series of things in these parts, within these <HI>Eleven</HI> or <HI>Twelve</HI> years past; relating to the difference, between our <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>George Keith;</HI> thou may easily discern, that we in and through it all, have not affected controversies for Contro∣versies sake, being still in the defensive part, casting off those <HI>Darts</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> and wiping away those <HI>Calumnies</HI> and Re∣proaches, that he and his <HI>Abettor</HI> D. L. from time to time, have cast upon our <HI>Christian Profession;</HI> both by Print and other ways, he and some Joining with him, having printed here at least <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Ten</HI> books, papers and Pamphlets against us, be∣fore we Printed one line against <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P>In his title page, he compares me to <HI>Shimei</HI> the <HI>Railer,</HI> and in page 29 says, I am a continual <HI>Wrangler;</HI> which as it is false, so if true, would be very unfitly charged by him, who by the same manner of speach, as continually <HI>Railing</HI> and <HI>Wrangling.</HI></P>
<P>As for his comparing me with <HI>Baals four hundred lying Pro∣phets:</HI> Let but the candid <HI>Reader</HI> observe both our books, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may soon see, how proof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss he hath been, in his attempts to prove m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such, though for a Proof of his own falseness, take here one instance from the following Certificate.</P>

<PB REF="001143_0003_0FB08B45A3DCA618"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might be heard: To which <HI>G. K.</HI> says, it was in modera∣tion and due <HI>Respect,</HI> that he desired the <HI>Governour to command them,</HI> to give him a hearing &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, what he may call in self defence, a desire with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Respect &amp;c.</HI> indifferent person that heard it, may possibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a commanding wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; however, he owns, he would then have had our Friends been <HI>Commanded</HI> by the <HI>Governour,</HI> to have heard him.</P>
<P>In page 50. he cites from <HI>Proteus</HI> thus. <Q>That I disturbed the Quakers Meetings, in all the other places in <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Long Island,</HI> into which I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me; and then says, all is false: for what disturbance was made, was wholly made by them and never by me.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems then, that his coming into our peaceable <HI>Meetings,</HI> from place to place, and imposing upon us, though in the midst of our <HI>Horship,</HI> his reflecting discourses upon our <HI>Principles</HI> or Persons; and we but desiring to enjoy our <HI>Meet∣ings</HI> peaceably; and pleading the right, we have so to do, or the like, is cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by him a disturbance, made by us, but not by him; which the impartial will surely censure him for.</P>
<P>Again, because I said, he came not to <HI>Shrowsberry</HI> Meeting himself; but sent a rash <HI>Precipitant</HI> Person &amp;c. <HI>G. K.</HI> to excuse it, says, the said Person came Voluntarily without his sending, for he had no Power to send him.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> That it is to be understood, by what I said, that he sent him by a compelling Power; I suppose none are so weak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o imagine: And observe, he himself says in the same Paragraph, that Wee sent, Mark [SENT] him a <HI>Scurrilous</HI> Answer: Now, if the one be fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, so is the other; for the Person that carried that, which he calls <HI>Our Scurrilous Answer,</HI> went as Volunta∣rily in that business, as <HI>George Keith</HI>'s friend could do in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: but this is like the rest of his shifting and quibling. — As for the mistake about the day of the week, it must be, either by the <HI>Transcriber</HI> or <HI>Printer,</HI> for it is said the <HI>Fifth</HI>-day in the <HI>O∣riginal</HI> relation, according to <HI>G. K</HI>'s <HI>Observation.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="001143_0004_0FB08B48547E5A68"/>Note <HI>Reader,</HI> that as much of <HI>G. K</HI>'s Book (to wave direct Answers to mine) consist's of divers cita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions from other <HI>Friends</HI> Writings, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>verted to what sence he pleases; so they having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if not most of them. Answered over and over by our <HI>Friends</HI>▪ I have taken <HI>G. K</HI>'s own method in his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reface,</HI> to draw u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what I thought fit to speak to; being what I think is Necessary at this time. One thing more I cannot but take notice of, (viz.) how poor, pittyfull and mean Spirit∣ed it is in this <HI>G. K.</HI> to take part as he doth, with <HI>D. L.</HI> in his so manifestly abusing <HI>W. P.</HI> by saying, that in pa. 20. of <HI>Sandy Foundation,</HI> he called the Man <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Finite Impo∣tent Creature;</HI> and says in pa. 61. that it's vain and Idle in me, to clear <HI>W. P.</HI> of that horrid assertion.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Certain it's vain and idle in <HI>G. K.</HI> with his vain and nonsenceable consequences, drawn from some expressions, in other books of <HI>W. P</HI>'s, that have no reference to the said pas∣sage, so to charge W. P. for he may as soon prove a thing to be, which is not, as to prove that <HI>W. P.</HI> there called the <HI>Man Christ,</HI> the <HI>Finite Impotent Creature.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Admit the <HI>Quakers</HI> were unsound, as he would ren∣der them to be: Yet surely, he is a person very unfit to charge them with it▪ Or to charge them with false doctrine, who is so confused about his own Doctrine, as in <HI>Proteus,</HI> and in this book is shewn.</P>
<P>Again, observe in his <HI>Preface</HI> to his <HI>Retractations,</HI> he saith he hath not renounced any one assertion, contained in any of his former books, that ever was judged by him an <HI>Article</HI> of <HI>Faith;</HI> and whereas, I have in <HI>Proteus</HI> shewn him, both books and pages, wherein he in divers respects, had called several <HI>Doctrines, Fundamental Principles &amp;c.</HI> and also shewed, that he hath now renounced those principles, and though he would put it off with saying, I no where remember, or I do not re∣member, that I called them <HI>Fundamentals;</HI> or if I did call them so, it doth not follow, that they are so, or the like: I say, though he thus puts it off, &amp; doth not, not in truth cannot deny,
<PB REF="001143_0004_0FB08B48547E5A68"/>but that he did acknowledge them to be Fundamentals: yet in his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>face</HI> we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind; that he very confidently say's, I falsly chargeth on him, that they are acknowledged by himself to be Fundamentals, O the confusion of the Man!</P>
<P>Again, as to his being, an <HI>Apostate;</HI> we well know, how he hath called upon W. P. to give him an opportunity, to prove him an <HI>A∣postate:</HI> As also in his challenge to our Friends at <HI>Rhoad-Island,</HI> He did the like. We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, upon the term <HI>Apostate,</HI> hear him in his page 35. what he saith; (viz.) <Q>If I have departed from <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Quakers,</HI> which either they or I held to be <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> but were no real <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of <HI>Christianity;</HI> but <HI>Dross</HI> and <HI>Rubish,</HI> built on the true Foundation, this will not prove me an <HI>Apostate</HI> from <HI>Christiani∣ty,</HI> but only from the <HI>Dross</HI> and <HI>Dregs</HI> of <HI>Quakerism,</HI> or what is worse: And let them call me so if they will, in that sence; for we find in <HI>Scripture,</HI> the word <HI>Apostate,</HI> according to the <HI>Greek,</HI> used in a good sence: <HI>Whoever names the name of</HI> Christ, <HI>let them d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rt from</HI> Iniquity, (the <HI>Greek</HI> here is <HI>Apostate</HI>) <HI>i.e. let him</HI> Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>from</HI> Iniquity:</Q> thus far <HI>G. K.</HI> All which puts me in mind. <HI>First,</HI> how he told his Auditory, before he went last to <HI>England,</HI> that if they heard, that he put on the <HI>Canonical Robe,</HI> and turned to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> that then they might call <HI>G. K.</HI> an <HI>Apostate: Secondly,</HI> how he termed some <HI>Presbyterians, Apostates;</HI> for so do∣ing: <HI>Thirdly,</HI> notwithstanding which, in his exact <HI>Narrative</HI> pa. 15. he is turned, and says, if we prove him not to have changed in any <HI>Fundamental Principle,</HI> he ought not to be charged as an <HI>Apostate;</HI> but now it seems, he is turned again, and allows us to call him an <HI>A∣postate,</HI> though he will not own he is changed in any <HI>Fundamental Principle;</HI> though but 4 pages before he saith: he who cannot prove him varied in any one <HI>Fundamental</HI> of true <HI>Christianity,</HI> cannot prove him an <HI>Apostate.</HI> And besides <HI>Observe,</HI> if the word DEPART, and the word <HI>Apostate,</HI> be of the same signification, why then hath he been so long uneasie under our terming him an <HI>Apostate,</HI> since he owns he has DEPARTED from Principles of <HI>Quakers?</HI> But this is but to shew his confusion; as also further, to shew from his own Mouth, that we had ground enough to term him an <HI>Apostate.</HI></P>
<P>Observe again, I having fully proved, that he hath DEPARTED from <HI>Principles,</HI> acknowledged by himself to be <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> to excuse it as above; he says, if I have departed from Principles of <HI>Quakers,</HI> which either they or I held <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> but were not so, but <HI>Dross, Rubish</HI> and <HI>Dregs &amp;c.</HI> this will not prove me an <HI>Apostate</HI> from <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Surely to hold <HI>Dross, Rubish</HI> and <HI>Dregs</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Fundamentals</HI>
<PB REF="001143_0005_0FB08B49C38273E8"/>of <HI>Christanity;</HI> is to err <HI>Fundamentally:</HI> And yet in page 18. he says, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver he had any of their <HI>Fundamental Errors,</HI> he utterly de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys▪ as if to hold <HI>Dross, Rubish</HI> and <HI>Dregs</HI> for <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> was not to have <HI>Fundamental Errors,</HI> and as if that, though he so held; yet he was always sound in <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> as he hath so long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oasted of.</P>
<P>Again, though he used so much to boast, that in his books, he did not contradict himself, and affirmed, we could never prove he did; but (saith he) on the contrary; I can prove a good consistancy of my present Doctrine with all my former and latter books; notwithstand∣ing, the insinuation of some to the contrary. s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some <HI>Fundamentals</HI> pa. 13. <HI>Appeal</HI> pa. 5. but now in pa. 31. he says, that contradictions may be found in some of my former books, it's probable &amp;c but wheth∣er there be any consistancy, betwixt a good consistancy of his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Doctrine, with all his former and later books and contradictions in his books; men of consistant sence and reason will soon determine▪ to conclude after all his noise; about <HI>Our</HI> and the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> being un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in Fundamentals, as in <HI>Proteus</HI> pa. 49. I hinted; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ells us, in pa. 34. that it's generally agreed amongst all true <HI>Christians,</HI> that the <HI>Apostles Creed,</HI> for the <HI>Simpliciter Credenda,</HI> contains all the <HI>Fun∣damentals</HI> of <HI>Faith;</HI> and in pa. 31. he saith, it's not what men think to be <HI>Fundamental,</HI> that is always so; but what men think so from the certain knowledge, that they have, that they are so by warrant from the <HI>Holy Scriptures?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Very well; then this I know, that whatsoever warrant we have from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> concerning any or every Article of the said <HI>Creed;</HI> we hold our selves oblidged, as much as any faithful∣ly, to believe; and we do accordingly believe them; and therefore by <HI>G.

<P><HI>Answer.</HI> I did not only say it, but in page 5 quoted 3 of his own books to prove it, to none of which do I find, that he hath made one word of an Answer; but says: <HI>The first and chiefest</HI> Controversie <HI>was, whether to Preach</HI> Faith <HI>in</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rist <HI>with∣out us, as both</HI> God <HI>and</HI> Man, <HI>and also</HI> Christ <HI>within us as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the</HI> Eternal Word, <HI>was to Preach two</HI> Christs, <HI>which</HI> William Stockdal <HI>one of their chief</HI> Prachers <HI>did accuse me of; and which they could never be drawn to Condemn.</HI></P>

<P>And tho' they might have severall Meetings before it was done; yet our Friend's Judgment published by themselves, shews that the cause of it's delay was, <HI>G. K's. Ʋnruly behavi∣our,</HI> and <HI>Extream Passion;</HI> which occasioned their <HI>Abruptly</HI> breaking up; And which Judgment also shewed, that wee de∣nied the words so charged by <HI>G. K. True Copy.</HI> page 2. So that it behoved our Friends, surely, not to be too hasty in giving Judgment in such a case: And this I also know, that at a great publick Meeting at the <HI>Bank</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> among a Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous Multitude of them and us; one of <HI>G. K's</HI> Com∣pany asked us, as he stood in the Gallery; whether to Preach Faith in <HI>Christ within</HI> and <HI>Christ without</HI> was Preaching two <HI>Christs?</HI> He was readily Answered on our behalf by a Ancient <HI>Ministring Friend</HI> of ours, NO, it is not: How then could that be the Main or any part of the Controversy, when both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides own'd one and the same Doctrine to be true, as well as
<PB N="3" REF="001143_0006_0FB08B51B3EA3CC8"/>that the Person accused denyed the charge, (as I have heard) to his Dying day?</P>
<P>And, as for the Business, of the <HI>Light,</HI> it's being <HI>Sufficient</HI> without something else: That never came up to the above main matter of Controversy; for we then own'd that the Faith o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Outward Sufferings &amp;c.</HI> was <HI>Indispensibly Necessary</HI> to OUR <HI>Salvation;</HI> and to all to whom it was made known and Re∣vealed, as will be shewn here after: So that the <HI>Question</HI> a∣bout the <HI>Light</HI> which <HI>G.

<P>But, that it may appear <HI>G. K.</HI> receiv'd this acknowledgment as insufficient; see his <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Innocency</HI> then Printed page 7. where he takes us up thus: <HI>And to say, this Faith is necessary to such to whom it is Preached to make them Christians &amp;c. But not to such Pious</HI> Gentiles, <HI>to whom it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot Preached; as if they could be perfectly</HI> Christians <HI>&amp;c. without i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> most evidently doth contradict the</HI> Scripture.

<P>Now, doth not this clearly shew, that the Question betwixt <HI>G. K.</HI> and our <HI>Friends,</HI> was not whether <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>

<P>As for his <HI>Scripture</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in page 2 to Prove that none can be Sound without that Knowledge of <HI>Chirst</HI>'s outward Suffer∣ing and Death in the outward. I have Examined them all▪ and does not find one of them make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out, that none are Saved with∣out that knowledge; however in such cases, Doubtless as the <HI>Scripture</HI> says, whatsoever the <HI>Law</HI> saith, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith to them that are under the Law; So also whatsoever the <HI>Gospell</HI> Outwardly saith, it saith to them that are under the Outward <HI>Administra∣tion</HI> thereof: And have heard of it▪ even as we see when <HI>Christ</HI> had on the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt Preach'd</HI> to the People: many Peculiar <HI>Gospell-Precepts</HI> he ended with saying, <HI>Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and do them not, shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a Foolish M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n &amp;c.</HI> Where Mark, <HI>Christ</HI> doth not say, he is like a Foolish man who hath not <HI>heard;</HI> But he who haveing <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eard;</HI> yet hath not Obeyed.</P>
<P><HI>But in Page</HI> 3 <HI>he seems to Restrict the Necessity of that Faith, to such as are Capable of Actual Faith, which</HI> Infants <HI>are not: And that it's according to a good Rule in</HI> Law <HI>and</HI> Divinity; <HI>That words are to be taken according to the Subject matter:</HI></P>

It cannot according to his <HI>Good</HI> Rule be after Death; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause the Subject in such cases is, how wee shall be fitted for Heaven before Death.</P>
<P><HI>Again in pa. 3. he saith, Note the Dullness of this</HI> Caleb Pusey, <HI>who seems to be as avoid of Good sence, and Reason, as his</HI> Mill-Stones; <HI>As if the Salvability of the Vertuous Heathen, could not consist with the Ʋniversal Neccesity of Faith, in</HI> Christ Crucified, <HI>but by the Notion of the</HI> 12. Revolutions, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> As Dull as he Renders me, I can easily enough see he is expert in Abusing me, by leaving out the last part of those words or <HI>Sentence</HI> in my <HI>Preface,</HI> which shewed that <HI>G. K.</HI> had also <HI>Printed</HI> of such Virtuous <HI>Heathen,</HI> that they could not Perish, tho' they Died in that State: And as I then laid down, 3 of his own Assertions, one of which as above he ve∣ry runningly left out, so I shall shew them Briefly over again▪ and let him try his skill to Reconcile them if he can. The first is that <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Suffering</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> in the outward, is <HI>U∣niversaly Necessary</HI> in order to Man's Salvation and Perfection.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> is, that Virtuous <HI>Heathen</HI> cannot miss of <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> is, that such Virtuous <HI>Heathen</HI> can't Perish, al∣tho' they Dye in that state: <HI>Refutation</HI> pa. 40. Now consider, if Virtuous <HI>Heathens</HI> cannot Perish, tho' they dye in a state with∣out that Knowledge, and yet that Knowledge is Indispensibly Necessary; for them to have in order to their Perfection, where shall they have that knowledge: If he say that in order to their being made Perfect, they shall have it after Death in Heaven; that would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>atly opposite to what he offer's in p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. of his <HI>4th. Narrative,</HI> where discoursing of Perfection he
<PB N="7" REF="001143_0008_0FB08C79273A7B00"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith; it must be at the instant of Death; <HI>and that is</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith he) <HI>neither before, nor after Death:</HI> Now I say, let him. Try his Skill to Reconcile these without the <HI>Revolutions;</HI> For if such Virtuous <HI>Heathen</HI> cannot Perish, tho' they Dye without that knowledge, and without which they can't be Perfect, and that the Instant of Death is the time of being made Perfect; How is it then that they cannot Perish, tho' they Dye in a state of not being made Perfect: Again, what, will now become of his saying round again, in his <HI>Shimei</HI> pa. 19. <HI>That in</HI> Heaven <HI>after this Life is M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n's Salvation Perfected▪ and not till then▪</HI> perhaps if I should venture to call these things Contradictions; I might be call'd by him, Dull Sophister, or somewhat else; how∣ever, I shall Venture to <HI>Appeal</HI> to the Candid <HI>Reader,</HI> whether they be not great Inconsist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nces and Confusions; neither did I as he, in pa. 2. <HI>Insinuates</HI> against me, make it an Error in him; (nor any else) to Preach <HI>Christ Crucified without us &amp;c.</HI> I have been often much Comforted and <HI>Edified,</HI> when in the Power and Demonstration of <HI>Truth,</HI> I have (in our Meetings) heard <HI>Christ</HI> as in the outward <HI>Preacht</HI> and Declared of.</P>
<P>In page 3. He saith: <HI>If</HI> C. P. <HI>had but Common Discre∣tion, he might know, that I had fully Answer'd that about the</HI> 12. Revolutions <HI>in my</HI> former books.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> He should have told what <HI>Books;</HI> for I know of no book formerly of his, (tho' I have seen many) wherein he hath Denied that <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>But in page 13. of <HI>Shemei,</HI> he Implicitly owns he held it as an Hypothesys, and then say's; <HI>Will a Change of mind in that Re∣spect prove me to be</HI> varied <HI>in a</HI> Fundamental <HI>&amp;c?</HI></P>

<P>in page 4, of <HI>Truth and Innocency</HI> where he was also shifting, about the <HI>Revolutions,</HI> he seem's to own it is a probable Opinion, tho' now he say's doth not own it, as such, and the Reason he renders is for that it is Inconsistant with the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Body, pa. 13.</P>

K.</HI> at that time, to gain the more upon those he had Drawn aside, valued himself high, as that he was a <HI>Primitive Quaker,</HI> and that he was one with all Faithfull <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> and that he was consistent with all his former <HI>Books,</HI> and we but <HI>Revolters</HI> or <HI>Heathens;</HI> and told how <HI>Friends Letters</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> had lately then come over, and Confirmed his <HI>Doctrine</HI> in every particular, then in difference betwixt <HI>him</HI> and <HI>us,</HI> see <HI>Plea Innocent</HI> pa. 17. Well, things being thus, and we began to tell him of the In∣consistency of his <HI>former</HI> and <HI>lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Books,</HI> as well as with other <HI>Friends Books,</HI> and that he could not prove so by us: then to shift and wave that, he would be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling us, what it was to be the best <HI>Christian,</HI> which might have been exceeding well in it's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce; or had he then denied the <HI>Quakers Doctrine</HI> to be <HI>Christian,</HI> it would have occasioned that to be the direct <HI>Question:</HI> But at that time, for the above reason, it did not seem so, tho' it was consequently, who was the best <HI>Christian;</HI> and indeed the <HI>Question</HI> at that time, was not at all, whether a <HI>Quaker</HI> was a <HI>Christian</HI> or not; that being granted on both sides; but it was whether <HI>G. K.</HI> or we, had m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Reserv'd the <HI>Quakers Principles;</HI> and Consequently which had Retain'd best the <HI>Christians:</HI> For the <HI>Quakers Religion</HI> was own'd by him to be no other, but r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all <HI>Christianity▪</HI> as he confest in his <HI>Pref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> to <HI>Serious Appeal.</HI></P>
<P>As for his Accusing me, in his pa. 4. of a <HI>Notorious Fals∣hood,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="001143_0010_0FB08C7E33D0D0F8"/>about our difference about eleven years ago, it's fully detected above.</P>
<P>Well, I having accused both <HI>D. L.</HI> the Eight <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>G. K.</HI> of Attesting, and Publishing very false things: First, for my saying in <HI>Postscript,</HI> there is no such thing as <HI>D. Leeds,</HI> the Eight <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>G. K.</HI> had Alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d against <HI>G. F.</HI> in page 28. of <HI>Great My<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tery,</HI> which they quoted against him, nor in any other part of that book, that I know of whereupon <HI>G. K.</HI> ask's, <HI>will this that I know of, excuse him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I needed not those word to excuse me, for they were more then I was oblidged to have said but what I said, was true both in saying so (and I have search'd divers other, places) &amp; also in saying it was not in the place cited in the <HI>margent,</HI> though <HI>G. K.</HI> had said in that very broad sheet, that thay did exactly a∣gree as cited in the <HI>margent;</HI> and as for page 28. being put for 47. what was that to me. I knew not the least of it.</P>
<P>Well, he further saith, Malice it <HI>self cannot fix it on the Eight</HI> Ministers.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No, how came <HI>D. L.</HI> and he to do it then? For t'was from them I had it, neither will that help him out to say, he said, <HI>Most of those Quotations are Attested with near 800 more in the</HI> 3d. and 4th. Narrative.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> What is that to the purpose? For what could be un∣derstood by the words (those Quotations) but those in that <HI>Sheet</HI> he said they had <HI>Attested?</HI> So let it be where or when it will, yet it was these in that <HI>Sheet</HI> that <HI>G. K.</HI> said they had <HI>Attested,</HI> and it could be understood no otherwise: But if <HI>Ma∣lice</HI> it self can't fix a wrong <HI>Quotation</HI> on them, yet <HI>Truth</HI> it self can in the behalf of which I do tell him, that they have <HI>At∣tested</HI> to that, in that very page 47. of <HI>Great Mystery,</HI> for <HI>G. F</HI>'s. words, which are not his but his <HI>Adversary's</HI> words, and then <HI>G. K</HI>'s and the <HI>Eight Ministor's</HI> Sence (by way of Consequence)
<PB N="11" REF="001143_0010_0FB08C7E33D0D0F8"/>put upon <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s words; which is not fair; especially since <HI>G. K.</HI> would make the World believe, that the Quotations do exactly agree with the Books out of which they are taken, and offers to Prove it to our Faces; but what heed is to be ta∣ken of what such a Lavish man says, he can Prove? for, tho' he hath cited his 4th <HI>Narrative,</HI> (the third I never saw) and five of the Eight <HI>Ministers</HI> have <HI>Attested</HI> to the Truth of them; yet I find in that very book, they have Quoted <HI>W. P.</HI> again wrong, and that Materially; for, as he did, in the <HI>Serious Call,</HI> Render <HI>W. Penn:</HI> to say <HI>Christ's Outward Manifestation is a Deadly Poy∣son &amp;c.</HI> So hath he, and five of the Eight <HI>Ministers</HI> who At∣tested it, rendered him also there wrong, for <HI>W. P.</HI> truely Quoted, tho' not fully, is, <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Christ's Outward Manifestation &amp;c.</HI> So that they have all left out again the Words <HI>[the History of.]</HI></P>
<P>Again, I find, that in Page 22, of the fourth <HI>Narrative,</HI> as also in <HI>G. K</HI>'s <HI>Serious Appeal</HI> (as Corrected) they have also <HI>Attested</HI> to a False Quotation out of <HI>G. Fox's Great Mystery</HI> page 302. where they Cite him thus, <Q>And the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which signi∣fies Writings, are not <HI>Infallible</HI> nor <HI>Divine,</HI> but <HI>Humane.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s words truely Cited is, <Q>And the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which signifies Writings, as you say, outward Writings, Pa∣per and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, is not <HI>Infallible,</HI> nor is not <HI>Divine,</HI> but is <HI>Hu∣mane.</HI></Q> Here wee see that all of them, left out those words <HI>[As you say outward Writings, Paper and Ink]</HI> and yet have <HI>Attested</HI> it to be exactly done. And for a further proof, that they have all made false Citations in the said 4th. <HI>Narrative;</HI> see <HI>John Whiting's</HI> book called <HI>Judas and the Chief Priests &amp;c.</HI> who hath de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected them of divers more false Citations.</P>
<P>Nay, in the very <HI>Serious Call,</HI> where it's pretended to be Corrected; he hath more wrong Quotations; First, <HI>Steven Crisps</HI> works pa. 160. where he hath added to the word Light,
<PB N="12" REF="001143_0011_0FB08C84D3E2CA30"/>the words <HI>[In us]</HI> which, are not <HI>S. C</HI>'s words.</P>
<P>Next, on <HI>Edward Burrows</HI> works Pa. 205. whose words truely quoted are: And you are in the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tchcraft, as they were (<HI>Gal:</HI> 3) who take on things in your own wills, who observe Commands from without, from the Letter; whereas they have left out <HI>[As they were Gal: 3 who take on things in your own wills.]</HI></P>
<P>As for what he says page 7. of my saying the word Anity, should be next after the word <HI>Manifestation;</HI> and is so Correct∣ed in the Marg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, I doe really own, that was a mistake, for though the Word <HI>Christianity</HI> was Corrected; yet the par∣ticle <HI>[S.]</HI> was too much, which I since saw, after it was too late.</P>
<P>Again, I observe he saith, page 11. <HI>If that Faith▪ meaning the</HI> Faith <HI>of</HI> Christ<HI>'s</HI> Outward Sufferings▪ <HI>be onely necessary to any, beacause it is Preacht or Declared in the</HI> Scripture; <HI>it would follow, that of Men left alone the Preaching of it &amp;c. They sould does a kindness to their</HI> Children, <HI>by Preaching only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, and Obedi∣ence to the</HI> Light within <HI>them for their</HI> Salvation. How doth <HI>G. K's</HI> way mend it? for by the same Rule, where he says, as above is shewn, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such who are Obedient to the <HI>Light within,</HI> though they Dye without that <HI>Faith,</HI> they cannot miss of <HI>Salvation;</HI> well, add however, what necessity is there to <HI>Preach</HI> any thing to our <HI>Children,</HI> but Obedience to the Light within for <HI>Salvation?</HI> according to <HI>G. K</HI>'s Doctrine: besides, is <HI>G. K.</HI> wiser then the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which saith: <HI>The Ingrafted word is able to save the Soul. And that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of the</HI> Law speaking of the <HI>Gentiles) shall be Justified;</HI> and yet, the <HI>Apostle</HI> saith, <HI>That the</HI> Jew <HI>that had the</HI> Scripture, <HI>had the Advantage of them, much every way, chiefly because to them were commended the</HI> Oracles of God, see <HI>James</HI> the 1.21. <HI>Romans</HI> the 3d. 1.2.</P>
<P>As for what he Quotes in page th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 8. and 9. about the <HI>Scrip∣ture;</HI> and of this speaking, of their being a secondary and sub∣ordinate
<PB N="13" REF="001143_0011_0FB08C84D3E2CA30"/>cause; and means, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstrument▪ and about our be∣lieving them &amp;c: I never denyed either; meaning by believing <HI>in the</HI> Scripture, to believe the matters and things contained therein, to be certain Truth; and that they are able to make the man of <HI>God</HI> wise unto <HI>Salvation,</HI> through Faith in <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI> Mark [<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rough Faith in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI>] It is not said through Faith in the <HI>History,</HI> but Faith in <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>As for what he says in page 13. about Taxing <HI>D. L.</HI> with a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quoted page; I have reviewed the place well, and the nearest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can make of it, is (as I said) pa. 40. But it being some thing blotted, makes me think it was Marred in the Printing▪ and tho' I mentioned it to <HI>D. L.</HI> yet I did not Render that as a <HI>Material</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uit in him. But as to the Substance of the Charge, which I said upon him and <HI>D. L.</HI> for wrong Citation, that I stand by, tho' it was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for leaving out the word <HI>[And▪]</HI> now <HI>G K.</HI> to excuse it, says, the word <HI>[And]</HI> in that place, seems Super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s See how he can take away a word, and pervert the meaning, to serve a turn; for that word, is also left out in the <HI>Corrected Copy</HI> of his <HI>Serious Call:</HI> and yet how he censures <HI>G. W.</HI> for but saying in defence of <HI>G. F.</HI> where he saith, as it there stands. <HI>He that hath the same</HI> Spirit <HI>that Raised up</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>is</HI> Equal <HI>with</HI> God; now says <HI>G. W.</HI> the word <HI>[He that hath]</HI> should be left out, as contrary to our sence and Principle: this <HI>G. K.</HI> censures, as not being Pro∣ved; and also cry's out and says at this rate <HI>not onely both</HI> A∣theism <HI>and</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sie, <HI>but the highest</HI> Blasphemy <HI>may be Defended.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> How! what <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy</HI> defended by our denying of it to be according to our <HI>Principle!</HI> and therefore say, it should be left out, and possibly a <HI>Typographical Errour;</HI> Would <HI>G. K.</HI> be so Censured, for <HI>Correcting</HI> an <HI>Errour</HI> of his own book? which he calls <HI>Typographical</HI> viz. [<HI>are not, that</HI> Prophets] to [<HI>are not those</HI> Prophets.] See his <HI>Retr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ta∣tion</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001143_0012_0FB08C8764AB2D30"/>Book pa. 7. Also he tells, that there are divers <HI>Typogra∣phicall Errors</HI> to be found in many or most of his former <HI>Books;</HI> Now would <HI>G. K.</HI> take it well, that any should accuse him, for excusing those <HI>Errors,</HI> and call it excusing <HI>Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sphemy,</HI> and put him to prove that they are <HI>Typographicall.</HI></P>
<P>Next, as to what in Page 16. <HI>G. K.</HI> calls <HI>C. P</HI>'s <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI> and <HI>Fallacious</HI> way of Defending <HI>W. P's</HI> saying, <HI>That the</HI> OUT∣WARD PERSON <HI>was Properly the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>We utterly deny it,</HI> hath been so often Answered, that I think it needless to say more of it, than to desire the <HI>Reader</HI> to compare notes with <HI>William Penn</HI> and him, about <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Outward Person,</HI> from <HI>G. K</HI>'s Book, <HI>Refutation,</HI> pa. 37. not retract, thus, if <HI>Christ</HI> be onely and wholly restricted, to <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Outward Person,</HI> as he came into <HI>Flesh,</HI> then there was no <HI>Christ</HI> nor <HI>Saviour,</HI> nor <HI>Mediator,</HI> before <HI>Mary:</HI> But this is express <HI>Contrary</HI> to <HI>Scripture,</HI> in many places; which saith: <HI>By</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>all things was</HI> Created <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And surely all the <HI>Faithfull</HI> in all Ages were par∣takers of <HI>Christ,</HI> and he lived in them, as well as in <HI>Paul;</HI> ob∣serve, surely the outward Person was not in them, nor in <HI>Paul</HI> neither.</P>
<P>I come now to examine a little, how he says to clear himself, (tho' in vain) of being varied about the Nine <HI>Fundamentalls,</HI> which I taxed him to be Varied about.</P>
<P>In page 19. he saith: <HI>Observe Reader, how he endeavours to</HI> Convict <HI>me of</HI> Contradiction <HI>for saying, the</HI> Express Knowledge <HI>and</HI> Faith <HI>of</HI> Christ <HI>as he</HI> Outwardly Suffered, <HI>is</HI> Necessary <HI>to</HI> the <HI>Perfecting of Mens</HI> Salvation, <HI>who have it not before Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Meer prevaricating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where did I ever go about, to fasten a <HI>Contradiction</HI> on him, for any such thing? What I charged on him, as a Contradiction, was? for saying in the year 1670. he denyed the <HI>Express Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Christ without &amp;c.</HI> to be <HI>Necessary,</HI> save to whom it is Revealed, But in the year 1689. <HI>Indispensably Necessary</HI> to the perfecting mens.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001143_0012_0FB08C8764AB2D30"/>Again, in the year 1692. the express knowledge was not <HI>Necessary,</HI> save to whom was Revealed.</P>
<P>Again, that in the year 1690. the distinct knowledge was <HI>Necessary</HI> to all.</P>
<P>But again, in the year 92. the distinct knowledge was not <HI>Necessary</HI> to all; see <HI>Proteus</HI> page 7. 8. 9. However it seems, whether before or after Death, he is now turned again, and holds the Express knowledge to be <HI>Ʋniversally Necessary</HI> some time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cting men's <HI>Salvation:</HI> But in his <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing</HI>-book pa. 17 he tells us; he still said, the Express knowledge, is not <HI>Ʋniversally Necessary.</HI> Nay, in pa. 43. he says; <HI>If any such thing can be found in his former books, he does</HI> Retract <HI>and</HI> Renounce <HI>it;</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow it seems as if he hath <HI>Re∣tracted</HI> that in page 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now seems in complyance with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to restrict the <HI>Ʋniversall Necessity,</HI> of the knowledge and <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Death &amp;c.</HI> to adult Persons, <HI>(viz.)</HI> such as are capable to receive it, which (saith he) <HI>In∣fants</HI> and <HI>Idiots</HI> are not; yet in his further discovery writt a∣gainst <HI>Samuell Jennings,</HI> who told <HI>G. K.</HI> that his then <HI>Doc∣trine</HI> of the Faith in <HI>Christ</HI> without, it's being Necessary to all Mankind, would affect <HI>Infants, Deaf</HI> and <HI>Dumb</HI> Persons &amp;c. to which <HI>G. K.</HI> Answered: I freely own it, that I have so affirmed, and do still affirm, see pa: 14.</P>
<P>Now is he not here <HI>Varied</HI> in <HI>Doctrine</HI> also. Well▪ in his page 19 he proceeds and says; <HI>That such who have had an Im∣plic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> Faith <HI>in</HI> Christ, <HI>here in this World, and not an</HI> Express, <HI>for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of an Opportunity to have it</HI> Revealed, <HI>they shall have it in</HI> Heaven, <HI>after this</HI> Life; <HI>for then is mens</HI> Salvation Perfected, <HI>and not till then.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> What does he mean by, for want of an opportunity of having it <HI>Revealed,</HI> does he not say in page 14. of <HI>Heresie</HI> and <HI>Hatred,</HI> that the <HI>Light within,</HI> being <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> is abundantly <HI>Sufficient</HI> to the knowledge of <HI>Christ,</HI> both as he

Also in his <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther Discovery</HI> Pa. 17. writt against <HI>Samuel Jennings,</HI> he affirms that the <HI>Light within</HI> being <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI>) is able to give the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Death.</HI> But now, it seemeth, according to <HI>George Keith,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> want an <HI>Opportunity</HI> to reveal it <HI>Expresly,</HI> what strange work is here. Again, observe as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, he now says, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> SALVATION <HI>is not</HI> perfected till after <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> But in his 4th <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣rative,</HI> not above 3 years ago, he says, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are not Perfected after</HI> Death, <HI>but at the</HI> Instant <HI>of</HI> Death. Well, I can Source forbear to Call these things, <HI>Contradictions;</HI> but having not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of Logick, I shall content my felt to call them (as above) <HI>inconsistenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Con∣fusions,</HI> tho' it may be he will call me (as he hath done) <HI>Dull S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster, Supine Ignorant, Miller Philosopher,</HI> or what not, for my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins.</P>
<P>In his pa: 19, he says, <HI>in opposition to me, That to say</HI> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us <HI>had no</HI> Express faith <HI>of</HI> Christ, <HI>before</HI> St. Peter preach'd <HI>it to him, will not prove, that either in his former estate he had, or had not any</HI> Implicits <HI>of</HI> Christ <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is still meer stuff, and stu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, he knows it was not I that said <HI>Cornelius</HI> had, or had not an <HI>Implicit saith,</HI> only as, <HI>Ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ominem.</HI> Which in pa: 32 he tells me, binds my adversary, but not me. Which is very <HI>True:</HI> And a good use I may make of it against him, in this Case; for, tho' <HI>Cornelius</HI> might not, before <HI>Peter</HI> preach∣ed to him, have any <HI>Faith</HI> at all in <HI>Christ Crucified;</HI> yet <HI>G. K.</HI> was Oblidged to believe, he had, because he said, <HI>he had not an</HI> Express <HI>knowledge of it:</HI> 2dly because he also said, <HI>that the Term</HI> Express) <HI>Implyed the Term</HI> [Implicit] see <HI>Proteus</HI> pa: 12, <HI>All which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswers, with his Logical terms, by meer shuffling.

<P>Well the Ninth and last <HI>Fundamental,</HI> is about the <HI>Resurrection;</HI> concerning which, I charged him with having <HI>Varied,</HI> by being joined to those who hold their <HI>Carnal</HI> conceptions of it, which he once denyed.

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> What is that to the purpose? The Question is, whether those <HI>Priests,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> too, (for I never heard but they ge∣nerally agreed about that Doctrine, in matter and manner) do not in G.

<P>Well, but G. K saith, <Q>Of that which Dissolves into <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Ashes,</HI> that is no proper part of mans Body; and therefore doth not <HI>Rise:</HI> they say; their Body's (which their Souls wait for the Redemp∣tion of) see Corruption. G. K. say's "that <HI>That,</HI> which is to be Rais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, neither consumes nor Corrupts.</Q></P>
<P>Again, he saith in <HI>Truth Advanced</HI> pa. 21. <Q>Though God made man, of the Dust of the Ground; yet that dust was not common Dust, but much more <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Refined</HI> then that of which the Bo∣dies since the fall are made up of, and in pa. 117 Tells us, "as the Body of man at first was made up of such Excellent Dust, so it shall be made up of the same again.</Q></P>
<P>Observe, it seems, according to this great Correction of Errors, men have not the same bodies now, that man had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l: But made of anothee sort of <HI>Dust,</HI> and that such Dust they shall be made up of again at the <HI>Resurrection;</HI> these it's like, are the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, by which he differs from those who hold the Carnal conceptions, as a∣bove. Well, as far as I see; for all this, if they do but both sides say, it shall be the same for matter and substance, they own both sides the <HI>Fundamental</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> tho' the one says, it's the Body that turns to <HI>Dust,</HI> and sees <HI>Corruption,</HI> that is to <HI>Rise;</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Body; and the

Well however, as above▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t seems according to G.

Well, it seems he soon had done with my long ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion from his book, about the <HI>Resurrection;</HI> and possibly, he might think it high time for him too: For when he speaks to it to the purpose, it will be expected, that he prove.</P>

<P>6thly. Where the <HI>Scripture</HI> is his Rule, for these Notions?</P>
<P>Lastly, wether the <HI>Church,</HI> which he is now a Member of, be one with him about this <HI>Fundamental</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P>Well in pa. 30 He hath framed a Syllogism, to Prove that he is not an <HI>Apostate &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> My P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oving an <HI>Apostate,</HI> was from his own <HI>Definitions, Reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Arguments▪</HI> see the Title page and that he is not so, I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind he hath so much as attempted to Prove: and therefore, his long Harangue from pa. 32▪ to 34 is a meer Go by, and Derogation from the point. I come to his 5th. Section, about what he calls <HI>Per∣secution,</HI> in his pa. 35 and 36. the matter and ground of offence, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Querys out of their <HI>Appeal,</HI> he unfairly recites; for as he hath recited it, it says they hired Men to Fight, and reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ered a <HI>Sloop</HI> by force of Arms, and gave a Commission so to do: but the Query truely cited saith; they hired Men to Fight, as accord∣ingly they did, and Recovered a <HI>Sloop,</HI> and took some <HI>Privateers</HI> by force of Arms: which clause, to wit, &amp; [accordingly they did, <HI>(Fight)</HI> and recovered a sloop &amp;c.] was cunningly done by G. K. to leave out (it's like) calling to mind how, true citing it would, Contradict, what he had writ formerly [viz.] That it was <HI>Peter Boss,</HI> and one or two more with him, that in a little boat, took the <HI>Sloop,</HI> having nei∣ther <HI>Gun, Sword</HI> nor <HI>Spear:</HI> see <HI>Antichrist</HI> and <HI>Saduce</HI> pa. 6. Observe, their Query saith, they did <HI>Fight,</HI> and recover a <HI>Sloop;</HI> whereas G. K. said, as above, it was took by two or three, without <HI>Gun, Sword</HI> or <HI>Spear.</HI></P>
<P>Again, his said 9th▪ <HI>Query</HI> saith, that they gave a <HI>Commission</HI> to <HI>Right,</HI> signed by three <HI>Justices</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> whereof one was a Preach∣er among them; whereas it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a <HI>Warrant,</HI> in the nature of a <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry,</HI> to bring the <HI>Robbers</HI> Back to <HI>Justice,</HI> without any word of <HI>Fighting, Killing</HI> or <HI>Destroying</HI> in it: Secondly it was not <HI>Signed</HI> by three <HI>Justices</HI> that were <HI>Quakers;</HI> neither was any one of them a <HI>Preacher</HI> among us. another Falshood was, that the <HI>Ministers</HI> her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, had ingrossed the Worldly <HI>Government;</HI> whereas there were divers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerned in <HI>Government,</HI> not <HI>Ministers,</HI> nor <HI>Quakers</HI> neither
<PB N="23" REF="001143_0016_0FB08C90871EF3C8"/>Now, though Men may well enough publish Queries, about Religi∣ous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; yet they should not speak untruths o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men, and espe∣cially those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Authority,</HI> by so Querying.</P>
<P>Again, G K. is not fair to leave out the rest for which the <HI>Autho∣rity</HI> here was <HI>fastly</HI> offended with him, which was expressly men∣tioned in the <HI>Proclam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion,</HI> as he calls it, herein after mentioned, [viz] not only his calling a <HI>Magistra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Impudent Rascal;</HI> but also calling the <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> (who was well known to be a <HI>Sober Ju∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us</HI> man <HI>Impudent</HI> Man; and at another time, telling him, that his name would <HI>Stinke,</HI> &amp; that he was not fit to be a <HI>Governour,</HI> with ma∣ny other S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting Abusive expressions, both to him and the <HI>Magi∣strates</HI> &amp;c. besides what he said to the <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> in publick Meeting, as cited in state of the case page 55. <HI>(viz.)</HI> Thou art a <HI>Pitiful Governour;</HI> why doest thou not send me to <HI>Prison,</HI> or order me to be <HI>Whiped?</HI> my Back Itches for a whipping; &amp; hath <HI>Long Icht</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Well, but in page 37. he says it was a matter of <HI>Religion</HI> to us at that time, in no case to use a <HI>Carnal Weapon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> O! what Mighty matter of <HI>Religion</HI> it was to him, never to proceed in any <HI>Christian</HI> way, either by way of Rebuke or Exhortation to them, that were concerned in taking the said <HI>Sloop;</HI> but rather com∣mend them for what they had done, no no! all was well, &amp; the <HI>Friends</HI> concerned, his dear <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> for about eight Months after that, and till for his <HI>ungovernable</HI> and <HI>Turbulent</HI> behaviour, and Sepa∣ration &amp;c. our <HI>Friends</HI> saw a necessity, of disowning him as a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Peaceable <HI>Gospel</HI> amongst us: then it was, and not till then, that he was Animated to accuse those, for doing that, for which before he had commended them.</P>
<P>Now, to <HI>Conclude,</HI> this, as it hath been the <HI>Quakers Principle</HI> from the beginning, to <HI>Cease</HI> from <HI>War;</HI> so it hath been always as much their <HI>Principle,</HI> that <HI>Government</HI> is an <HI>Ordinance</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and that it ought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et up in all <HI>Countrys;</HI> for the <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Evil Do∣ers,</HI> and the Praise of them that do <HI>Well:</HI> se <HI>Edward Burro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> works pa. 754. and as <HI>Richard Huberthorn</HI> told <HI>KING CHARLES</HI> the Second, in Discourse with <HI>Him,</HI> that such <HI>Government</HI> we could <HI>Assist,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth in <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> and <HI>Estate.</HI></P>
<P>As to the noise he hath made from pa. 37. to 44. about another <HI>Presentment,</HI> then what I mention'd and Recited in my book, I have this to say in sincerity and Truth, that I never knew, nor so much as ever heard of any other, to the utmost of my Remembrance; neither hath G. K. produced any Proof; that there was another▪ neither do
<PB N="24" REF="001143_0017_0FB08C922E275A78"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> understand that there's any such thing upon the <HI>Court Records,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sides what <HI>Presentment</HI> I spoke of, was taken from our own book of the <HI>Trial,</HI> giving an account what they called in it <HI>Persecution</HI> here, and which was published by them in the year 1693. but <HI>G. K.</HI> says, that <HI>Presentment</HI> against him, for which he says, they would have found him <HI>Guilty</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> was in the year 92. see account <HI>Quakers Politicks</HI> pa. 28.</P>
<P>Well, how was it likely then, I should expect there was another <HI>Pre∣sentment,</HI> &amp; such a Severe one too, when their own book of their <HI>Tryals,</HI> published the next year, mentioned nothing of it? no, nor in any other book; as ever I heard of, was it ever published: but since <HI>G. K.</HI> does so positively affirm there was another, I shall not be positive against it; but as he hath produced no other, so I dare say, he never will be able to prove his charge in any other; viz. That they would have found him Guilty of <HI>Death,</HI> if the <HI>Government</HI> had not been changed, so that as to the substance of his complaint, I still say, a more Wick∣ed, Malicious, and False assertion, could hardly have been Invented, against those then in <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>Well, in pa. 41. he cryes out; <Q>Now observe the <HI>Logick</HI> of this <HI>Caleb Pusey▪</HI> the <HI>Presentment</HI> was <HI>Prosecuted</HI> and <HI>Tryed;</HI> therefore, there was no other <HI>Presentment.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> He states the matter too short, which should be rather thus: The <HI>Presentment</HI> in the 10th. Month 92. was <HI>Prosecuted &amp;c.</HI> therefore (as <HI>G. K.</HI> says in pa. 41. the other being not untill several Months after that of the 10th. Month 92.) there was no other <HI>Presentment</HI> in the year 92. But that of the 10th. Month 1692. and let him but prove, if he can, that there was any other <HI>Presentment</HI> in that year.</P>
<P>Well, however he says, he hath prov'd another, therefore, his proofs I shall examine: but first take notice, in pa. 36. how unfairly he mispresents the <HI>Magistrates Proclamation,</HI> as he there calls it, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Querys.</HI> He saith, they gave out, as is said, their <HI>Proclama∣tion</HI> against him▪ and charged him and others with a seditious paper▪ tending to the subversion of the <HI>Government</HI> &amp;c. Now after those words, [Subversion of the <HI>Government</HI>] G: K: stops, but the words following are [or to the Aspersing the <HI>Magistracy</HI> thereof.] Now this shows <HI>G. K.</HI>'s cunning (I will not say dull) <HI>Sophistry:</HI> for by those Last words it's clear, they did not positively Charge them with doing that, which Tended to the subversion of the <HI>Government.</HI> Now if <HI>G: K.</HI> had put in those last words, his charge against them would not have ap∣peared so high by Far. Well as above, this g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Logician</HI> calls out; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="25" REF="001143_0017_0FB08C922E275A78"/>saith in page 41, he hath given sufficient <HI>Evidence,</HI> that there was an∣other <HI>Presentment</HI> &amp;c. But what is the <HI>Evidence?</HI> why, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems the <HI>Magistrates</HI> Charg'd him in a <HI>Proclamation</HI> in the 6th. mt▪ 92. (for then it was) And gave a hint of what they then intended against him, and others, in its proper place, for Publishing the above <HI>Paper;</HI> therefore there was another <HI>Presentment</HI> several months after the 10th. Mth. 1692. Well, in his pa. 42 hear him again thus: <Q>Judge, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Reader if this C. P. be not as fast held in the Net as if he had a Thief in his Mill:</Q> But how so pray? Why, I had said▪ he was not accused in the Presentment, for Endeavouring to alter the <HI>Government;</HI> Yet it seems in the Proclamation, there were such words. Now again; behold <HI>G. K</HI>'s <HI>Logick:</HI> He was accused of it in a Proclamation in the 6. Mth 92. therefore it was in the <HI>present</HI> Mth. several Mths <HI>after</HI> the 10: Mth. 92. <HI>take notice,</HI> as above, there was not such a Positive charge in the said Proclamation neither.</P>
<P>Well, in p 42. he says, <Q>they wanted no will to have made him <HI>Guilty</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>That</HI> he had <HI>sufficiently</HI> proved by their <HI>severe Accusations</HI> against him, of <HI>speaking</HI> and <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing</HI> what tended to the <HI>Subversion</HI> of the <HI>Kings Government</HI> as well as <HI>W. P</HI>'s, which he took to be a capital <HI>Crime,</HI> and that such a <HI>Crime</HI> deserved <HI>Death &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now Pray, observe his <HI>Logick</HI> again, as well as his baseness▪ he saith sufficiently proved (he says) they wanted no will, to have made him Guilty of <HI>Death,</HI> because he himself hath said, without any Proof, that he was charg'd for Speaking and Writing, what tended to the subversion of the <HI>Kings Government,</HI> as well as <HI>W. P</HI>'s▪ But his putting in the <HI>Kings Government,</HI> is very base, and sign to Agravate his charge against the then <HI>Magistrates,</HI> as well as to clear himself of Abusing them; for there was no such words, as the <HI>Kings Government,</HI> in the <HI>Prolamation;</HI> neither hath he attempted to make any Proof, that he was charg'd any other where, For speak∣ing what tended to the subversion of the <HI>Kings Government.</HI></P>
<P>Well I n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w come to examine his proo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess proofs, that they would have found him Guilty of <HI>Death,</HI> he recites from the <HI>Law</HI> made 1684▪ these words; <Q>That who by speaking, or writing, do commit any act or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, tending to the subversion of the present <HI>Government▪</HI> shall Suffer <HI>Imprisonment</HI> for any time, not exceeding twelve Months and undergo such <HI>Corporal Punishment,</HI> as the <HI>Quality</HI> of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en∣der, and nature of the Offence may require.</Q></P>
<P>Now says G. K. pa. 43. that they had a mind to make it Capital, is evident.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001143_0018_0FB08C90871EF3C8"/><HI>Ans.</HI> Now is it <HI>Evident?</HI> Nay, then he had done something; but Pray where is his <HI>Evidence?</HI> why, hear his following words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>One of their own <HI>Profession,</HI> who knew their design, told me, they were preparing a <HI>Gibbet</HI> for me; this I can Attest upon <HI>Oath.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Pretty <HI>Logick</HI> again! G. K. says himself, in his own case, that one of our own Profession told him, they were preparing a <HI>Gibbet</HI> for him; therefore they would have made his crime <HI>Capital,</HI> viz. such as deserves <HI>Death,</HI> as he himself construes it, Ibid: when possibly, if the Truth of the matter were known, the Person that told him so, was no <HI>Quaker;</HI> but a great favourer of him: &amp; that Person only told him so in Waggery, being <HI>Ben Waller,</HI> now of <HI>Burlington;</HI> for so I have been informed it was.</P>
<P>Well he proceeds, and tells pa. 43. 44. how he hath enquired at the ablest <HI>Lawyers</HI> here, (viz.) those recommended to him as the Ab∣lest whether the <HI>Corporal Punishment</HI> in the said <HI>Act,</HI> might not by the Letter of the <HI>Law</HI> be construed, to extend to <HI>Death,</HI> seeing <HI>Death</HI> was but a <HI>Corporal Punishment? &amp;c.</HI> and, says he, <Q>the said <HI>Lawyers</HI> have Unanimously Answer'd me, that tho' they could not <HI>Hang</HI> me by Law, yet they could, if it was their will, cause to <HI>Whip</HI> me to <HI>Death:</HI> for it <HI>Whipping</HI> be the <HI>Corporal Punishment</HI> intended by the Law, there is no <HI>Limitation,</HI> as to the <HI>Number,</HI> or the severity of <HI>Lashes.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Whether this relation he gives, of the ablest <HI>Lawyers,</HI> be true or no, I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w not: but if true, I must tell him, I am with sub∣mission to better Judgments of another opinion: for tho' that Law did not assigne the number of stripes, yet there was a <HI>Law</HI> made at the same <HI>Sessions,</HI> limiting the Stripes not to exceed twenty one, where they are not otherways assigned. Besides, I don't in the least question, but, if a Person was upon Tryal of his <HI>Life,</HI> upon that <HI>Law,</HI> the ablest of these <HI>Lawyers,</HI> for a small Fee, would undertake to prove that a man could not be put to <HI>Death</HI> by any such <HI>Law;</HI> and that so to do, would not be a doing of it by that <HI>Law;</HI> but by grosly perver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing that <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>Again He says, <HI>That One of the Gentlemen</HI> Lawyers, <HI>that was Rec∣koned one of the Ablest in the</HI> Province, <HI>told him by that very</HI> Law, <HI>the</HI> Quaker Magistrates <HI>might have</HI> Oarified <HI>him</HI> (viz) <HI>as is said, was in∣tended against</HI> Dr. Oats <HI>in</HI> England, (viz) <HI>Cause to Whip You with an in∣tention, to Whip You till you</HI> Dyed.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> a Severe <HI>Whipping!</HI> But I dare pass for it, upon an occasion that might happen about the like <HI>Law,</HI> wherein that Able <HI>Lawyer</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="27" REF="001143_0018_0FB08C90871EF3C8"/>mihgt be appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to, by any Client, Especially, if he were b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t weighty in his application, he would soon shew a Retrogate opinion, upon that <HI>Law,</HI> to that above mention'd; Now suppose all this be true that he tells, the <HI>Lawyers</HI> said in the case, how does this prove G. K.'s charge, that they would have found him guilty of <HI>Death,</HI> if the <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> had not been changed? why no way, but by his usual sort of <HI>Logick, (viz.)</HI> the <HI>Lawyers</HI> said, by that Law they might have put him to <HI>Death;</HI> therefore they would have found him Guilty of <HI>Death.</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, reckoned one of the ablest <HI>Lawyers</HI> said, they might by that Law have <HI>Oatified</HI> him; therefore they would have found him Guilty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Death.</HI> For after all this, noise no greater Proof do I find he hath given, in all his rooks, then those proofless ones, above mention'd either that there was another <HI>Presentment,</HI> by which they intended to find him. Guilty of <HI>Death;</HI> or that they wanted not will so to have done; or that in other way they would have found him guilty or Death.</P>
<P>Well he says, <HI>Coll Markham,</HI> then Deputy <HI>Governour, Andrew Robinson,</HI> and other, <HI>Justice,</HI> sign'd a publick Writing, wherein they fully cleared him of all things the <HI>Quaker Magistrates</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to his charge.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> How did they clear him? from calling the <HI>Governour</HI> an <HI>Im∣pudent</HI> Man? and telling him he was not fit to be a <HI>Governour?</HI> and that his Name should <HI>Stink?</HI> or from calling a <HI>Magistrate Impudent Rascall?</HI> or did they clear him from misrepresenting the <HI>Magistrates</HI> in their Printed Appeal? or did they clear him from his abusing another <HI>Magistrate,</HI> by falsly accusing him, for putting his hand under <HI>Wo∣mens Pety Coates:</HI> Bid him go home to his <HI>Whores?</HI> If they did pretend to clear him of these things, it was not well done to be sure.</P>
<P>Well, in pa. 46. he will not own, that it would be any <HI>Persecution,</HI> for the Civil <HI>Magistrate,</HI> to Punish us, &amp; use some outward Coercioth and Restraint, by hindring our <HI>Preaching</HI> in publick <HI>Assembly</HI>'s <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Therefore I think soon to end this <HI>Head;</HI> for it plainly ap∣pears, he is full Ripe for <HI>Persecution;</HI> (tho' under the pretence of Persecutors common charge <HI>(viz.) Vile Heresie</HI>) tho' the name, now, is so Odious amongst most <HI>English</HI> men, that he chuses rather it seems, to call it Punishing, then Persecuting.</P>
<P>Well in his <HI>Postscript,</HI> I find few or, no Citations, that are Mate∣rial in themselves to be spoken do, but what have been Answered by our <HI>Friends,</HI> so often over and over, that I think it needless to spend much time, or Paper about them; yet I shall give a touch of some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ges in it, as <HI>First,</HI> his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt at Infallibility upon my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

F. sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke so of such, as got only the Words, and other mens Lines, made ready to their hands, as he there charged them, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed the Teachings of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the <HI>Lord &amp;c.</HI> And so were not so much as in the <HI>Faith</HI> of it; yet it follows not, that he meant People were under the <HI>Curse,</HI> for every <HI>Mistake.</HI></P>
<P>As for what he says aginst <HI>W. P.</HI> about <HI>Christ</HI> in us, offering up him∣self a Living <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to <HI>God</HI> for us, by which the wrath of <HI>God</HI> is ap∣peased to us.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I am satisfied, it was neither intended to deny or less<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the great <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> on the <HI>Cross</HI> without us, any more then G. K. did when he said thus, <Q>even at mans <HI>fall,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed of the <HI>Woman</HI> was given not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bruise the <HI>Serpents</HI> head, but also to be a <HI>Lamb</HI> or <HI>Sa∣cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fice</HI> to attone &amp; pacifie the Wrath of <HI>God</HI> towards Men, &amp; this is the <HI>Lamb</HI> that was slain from the <HI>foundation</HI> of the <HI>World;</HI></Q> The way to the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> not Retracted pa. 125. besides it was a <HI>living Sacrifice,</HI> &amp;c. not a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Death,</HI> on the <HI>Cross,</HI> as W. P. spoke of; and as I believe G. K. did not intend to lessen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> render it inconsistant with <HI>Christs</HI> offering up himself for the Sins of the World <HI>outwardly,</HI> no more I am satisfied, did W. P. As for that, about <HI>Robert Barclay</HI>'s speaking against unlawfull <HI>Games,</HI> and super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uity in Apparel; it's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>if<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing therefore I shall say no more of it, then to tell them that the Subject <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> treated of, was not about some mens wearing better cloathes then others; But about meer needless, costly and <HI>Super∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> Cloathings:</HI> nor about <HI>Children's</HI> playing in the Streets as he speaks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: But rather that when come to men, they should put away <HI>Child∣ish</HI> things.</P>
<P>Well in pa. 58. he thinks to call <HI>Christ</HI> as man, Impotent, is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>arrantable, if not <HI>Blasphemous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But I never found that <HI>W. P.</HI> ever termed <HI>Christ</HI> as man Im∣potent.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pa. 57. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me saying to D. L. did I ever take, or go about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> only▪</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001143_0019_0FB08C90871EF3C8" MS="y"/><HI>Ans.</HI> That was because D. L. had so often charged <HI>W. P.</HI> for cal∣ling <HI>Christ</HI> as <HI>Man,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Impotent Creature:</HI> But as one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat was Concern'd, he could not make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear as he charged him from p. 20. for there is no such thing, so he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lipt over to pa. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. where with leaving out the word <HI>Creature,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endring the word <HI>Finite</HI> in that page, to signifie also <HI>Impotent,</HI> he cunningly strove though against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eam to make good his charge there, by Consequence, for which I detected him, by using that word <HI>[only]</HI></P>
<P>In p. 64. he says; <Q>he never though or said that <HI>He (Christ)</HI> was <HI>Impotent,</HI> or a <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nite Impotent Creature;</HI> most unjust it is therefore, for <HI>C. P.</HI> to lay this at my door.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I remember not, that ever I charged him with terming <HI>Christ</HI> as Man <HI>Impotent,</HI> but by way of <HI>ad homin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> to <HI>D. L.</HI> who would fallen it as above upon <HI>W. P.</HI> because he term'd <HI>Christ</HI> as <HI>Man,</HI> to be <HI>Finite▪</HI> therefore in making satisfaction &amp;c he was <HI>Impotent:</HI> see <HI>Rebuke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rebuked</HI> in pa. 7. well consistant with which the <HI>Mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> with∣out any further pretence to the Logical art, frames this <HI>Syllog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm:</HI> He that owns <HI>Christ</HI> as man to be <HI>Finite;</HI> Owns <HI>Christ</HI> as man to be <HI>Impotent:</HI> but G. K. owns <HI>Christ</HI> as man to be <HI>Finite:</HI> Ergo. Now if the Major proposition, nor conclusion pleases him not let him lay that at his great Friend <HI>D. L</HI>'s door; for it is his, and not mine: And therefore, it behoves them to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econciled between themselves, before they seek such a continual. Wrangling with us▪ for G. K. says, <HI>Christ</HI> as <HI>Man</HI> is <HI>Finite,</HI> but not <HI>Impotent: D. L.</HI> says, if <HI>Christ</HI> as a <HI>Man</HI> is <HI>Finite,</HI> Consequently <HI>Impotent:</HI> And also says, that persion of several Societies of <HI>Christians</HI> hold so too; and for his part, he dare not call it <HI>Blasphemy</HI> so to affirm, see ibid. p 9. 10. tho' in his <HI>Trumpet &amp;c.</HI> he calls it <HI>Blasphemy</HI> in <HI>W. P.</HI> so to affirm.</P>
<P>As for what he says in his Preface about meeting him, and that the Truth can never be so well found out, as by having the Author books openly produced, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> read.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> To read them ones self; and take some necessary time to read the <HI>Cort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>▪<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as well as the <HI>Text<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and to see that we take a right the sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect treated on, in order to consider more certain the sence of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that we may not miss the Truth nor wrong our Nighbour: Surely every free and impartial mind will say, this is the most sure way to find whether the things, so cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged against our <HI>Friends</HI> be so or not. And there∣fore his saying wee cannot be so ease<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y detected in writ; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay otherwise for the above reasons. And surely people cannot be so easily deceived, when like the noble <HI>Berrheans,</HI> they are willing to weigh &amp; deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<PB N="30" REF="001143_0020_0FB08C9B9C309D20"/>matters as charged against us, and with an impartial E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where truly cited, compare them with the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as they may, when they only hear them brokenly read, and to as much disadvantage at all times, as they that read them think good. And as for his saying, <HI>Paper will not blush,</HI> what is that to the purpose? For the <HI>Innocent</HI> need not blush, neither is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lushing</HI> always a signe o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Guilt,</HI> I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Ex∣perience; neither is <HI>Confidence</HI> always a signe of <HI>Innocency:</HI> which, if <HI>G. K</HI> would speak as it is, I believe <HI>He</HI> might say, <HI>He knows that by LARGE EXPERIENCE also.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas in his page 49. he says, that at a <HI>Meeting</HI> with the <HI>Quakers</HI> by ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eement, our <HI>Friends</HI> read the <HI>book</HI> called ONE WON∣DER MORE; where he says, it's falsly charged on him, that he took the <HI>Scotch League</HI> and <HI>Covenant:</HI> To which I say, it's falsly so said by him; for there is no such <HI>Words</HI> in that <HI>book,</HI> that says he took it: But thus; that his <HI>Education, Judgment</HI> and <HI>Affection,</HI> in his <HI>Youth</HI> so dipt him in the <HI>Scotch Solemn League</HI> and <HI>Covenant,</HI> that he Glo∣ries in it; and says, that by it prelacy was declared a <HI>Limb</HI> of <HI>Anti-Christ,</HI> the horrible thing set up in the land, and that he had <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> to the <HI>Most High God</HI> against it, and had kept his <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w &amp;c.</HI> and quoted G.

<P>AND lastly, concerning the Disturbance, G. K. and his <HI>Compani∣on,</HI> made at our <HI>Yearly Meeting;</HI> and concerning, which they have taken several depositions. The substance of that matter was on this wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: On the 21st. of the 7th. Month 1703. <HI>John Talbot,</HI> a protest <HI>Minister</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> G.
