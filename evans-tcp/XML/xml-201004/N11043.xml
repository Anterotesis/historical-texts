<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Each British Ghost by thee depriv'd of Breath,</L>
<L>Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy Death.</L>
<BIBL>POPE's Homer.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>REFORM thy conduct, Monarch, or attend,</L>
<L>The doom denounc'd, by virtue's constant friend,</L>
<L>Heav'ns awful God, his mandate 'tis I bear,</L>
<L>And call on George's callous soul to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reform thy conduct, or expect that Heav'n,</L>
<L>By whom thy delegated pow'r is giv'n,</L>
<L>Will rouse in wrath, and hurl thee from the throne,</L>
<L>Unworthy Prince, whom Britons blush to own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See civil rage torment the bleeding land,</L>
<L>Rais'd and supported by a Monarch's hand;</L>
<L>Permit me Prince, t'unfold the dreadful scene,</L>
<L>And actions that disgrace the name of men,</L>
<L>See British legions reeking from the sword</L>
<L>Of worthless Britons, and their misled Lord,</L>
<L><PB N="222" REF="013993_0002_0F925926A9D6B568"/>
The orphan'd son, the helpless mother see,</L>
<L>Plung'd in the depths of awful misery.</L>
<L>Youth and hoary age lie whelt'ring on the plains,</L>
<L>And desolation and destruction reigns:</L>
<L>Such scenes as these must sure your soul appall,</L>
<L>Thou art th' occasion, thou the cause of all;</L>
<L>What e'er thy cursed minions can design,</L>
<L>Thou giv'st assent, and the whole guilt is thine;</L>
<L>See Britain wasted by her father's sword,</L>
<L>And France and ev'ry foreign aid implor'd;</L>
<L>Suppose they shou'd be conquer'd, what remains,</L>
<L>What can be had from captives and from chains;</L>
<L>What large revenues can your coffers boast,</L>
<L>From ruin'd cities, and a wasted coast,</L>
<L>From nations slaughter'd, and from seas of blood,</L>
<L>What gain to make the mighty mischief good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Remember Prince on what precarious ties,</L>
<L>The uncertain safety of a tyrant lies;</L>
<L>What poor defence will guards and armies yield,</L>
<L>When long insulted subjects take the field;</L>
<L>What safety then can parasites bestow,</L>
<L>Or how elude the long deserved blow;</L>
<L>When justice rises and demands the blood</L>
<L>Of haughty tyrants, and their fawning crowd;</L>
<L>Ah, blush, deluded Prince, with comcious shame</L>
<L>That George should merit that detested name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search British annals, and let them declare,</L>
<L>Those truths too harsh to wound the royal ear;</L>
<L>See brave Fitzwalter lead the Barons on,</L>
<L>And force the unwilling deed from coward John;</L>
<L>With iron sway the blust'ring dastard rules,</L>
<L>The constant dupe of swarming knaves and fools.</L>
<L>"The weakest Athiest wretch all Heav'n defies,</L>
<L>Who shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies."</L>
<L><PB N="223" REF="013993_0003_0F925927D0A45870"/>
So shrunk the tyrant, when Fitzwalter led,</L>
<L>His warlike cohorts on to Runny Mead,</L>
<L>Then ancient Windsor's lofty towr's beheld,</L>
<L>The blazing standards waving o'er the field,</L>
<L>The shining jav'lins glittering from afar,</L>
<L>The moony shields and all the pomp of war;</L>
<L>Sheath'd in bright steel then Britains saviours stood,</L>
<L>Undaunted, firm, and resolutely good;</L>
<L>Forth in the midst the frowning tyrant came,</L>
<L>And viewed with fear and rage each godlike name.</L>
<L>The coward shrunk at Britain's brave array,</L>
<L>And Magna Charta crown'd the glorious day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search further yet how Edward's minions fell,</L>
<L>That galling truth, to Bute and Mansfield tell.</L>
<L>May every curse, vindictive heaven can pour,</L>
<L>Descend on them, in one destructive shower,</L>
<L>Perish their names O! let the traitors bleed;</L>
<L>Justice demands, the realm approves the deed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceed and be by faithful hist'ry taught,</L>
<L>How Essex labour'd, and great Cromwell fought;</L>
<L>When haughty Charles disgrac'd the British throne,</L>
<L>And trod our freedom and religion down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That dreadful Crisis big with loud alarms,</L>
<L>Call'd every Briton to assert in arms</L>
<L>The dear bought rights, the violated cause,</L>
<L>Of their dear country and its sacred laws;</L>
<L>They came obedient to the glorious call,</L>
<L>One generous spirit animated all:</L>
<L>Such generous souls may Britain yet afford,</L>
<L>And own again a Cromwell's saving sword;</L>
<L>An Hampden yet, an Essex yet may rise,</L>
<L>And tyrants yet may fall a sacrifice.</L>
<L>Illustrious shades the faithful muse shall crown,</L>
<L>Your glorious names, with honour and renown,</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="013993_0004_0F92592824AF01A8"/>
Long as this world with all its splendor stands,</L>
<L>Stupendeous frame, rais'd by immortal hands.</L>
<L>Long as the annals of eternal fame,</L>
<L>Record each hero's and each patriot's name,</L>
<L>Long as a Briton lives t' assert the cause,</L>
<L>Of heaven, of freedom, and the British laws;</L>
<L>So long shall Cromwell's, Hampden's name remain</L>
<L>And times erasing vengeance prove in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inspire your children, O ye patriot band,</L>
<L>To rush on death, and save a sinking land;</L>
<L>You who could haughty tyranny repel,</L>
<L>Protect the cause, in which you nobly fell,</L>
<L>That glorious cause, which heaven eternal owns,</L>
<L>And fires to vengeance your too tardy sons:</L>
<L>They rise at length, t' assert the freedom given,</L>
<L>T' assert the cause of liberty and heaven;</L>
<L>Tremble thou tyrant at the awful day,</L>
<L>When injur'd Britons give their vengeance way;</L>
<L>Tremble ye minions who your Prince misled,</L>
<L>Uncommon wrath remains for you to dread,</L>
<L>The traytors who your sovereign's heart have steel▪</L>
<L>And cur'st him with a soul that cannot yield,</L>
<L>Eternal vengeance must your crimes pursue,</L>
<L>Justice demands you, as the public due.</L>
<L>Unseeling man, if e'er thy soul can know,</L>
<L>Steel'd as it is, the touch of human woe;</L>
<L>If generous pity can a thought impart,</L>
<L>To shake the horrid purpose of your heart,</L>
<L>If pity harbours in that iron breast,</L>
<L>Call back your cut-throats, give your people rest;</L>
<L>Withdraw your fleets, send no more armies o'er,</L>
<L>But bid the martial thunders cease to roar.</L>
<L>Do this, and Britain may again forgive,</L>
<L>Again consent to let a tyrant live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="225" REF="013993_0005_0F925928C36C1558"/>
<L>But dare not trifle with a moment given,</L>
<L>Presumptous Prince, nor spurn with awful heaven,</L>
<L>Think not that Britons passive will remain,</L>
<L>Hug the vile yoke, and smile upon the chain;</L>
<L>They have not learnt the faith which cowards own,</L>
<L>"The enormous faith of many made for one,"</L>
<L>Far nobler precepts fire the British breast,</L>
<L>Then yielding freedom for inglorious rest;</L>
<L>Far nobler ends their freeborn spirits own,</L>
<L>Then basely crouching to a tyrants throne;</L>
<L>Such base concessions stain'd not Britain's fame,</L>
<L>When Charles's death immortaliz'd their name▪</L>
<L>Or guilty James his injur'd subjects fled,</L>
<L>Lay hid in France and trembled for his head;</L>
<L>Remember this, O monarch, nor presume,</L>
<L>On tir'd out faith and lenity to come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sword is drawn and hellish discord roars,</L>
<L>Let loose by Mansfield on North Am'rick's shores,</L>
<L>The trait'rous Thane t' enslave a nation joins,</L>
<L>And blust'ring North avows their cur'st designs;</L>
<L>George too consents and signs the horrid deed,</L>
<L>By which innumber'd innocents must bleed.</L>
<L>With tenfold rage, inspire, O muse, the strain,</L>
<L>To paint the horrors of this guilty reign;</L>
<L>Young Allen dies in his paternal field,</L>
<L>And murder'd laws, audacious murderers shield,</L>
<L>The sovereign too t' enlarge the mighty guilt,</L>
<L>Thanks his dear Scotsmen for the blood they've spilt</L>
<L>Petitions spurn'd at, with a sulky frown,</L>
<L>The Monarch drives his subjects from the throne,</L>
<L>Astonish'd that those subjects dare to sue,</L>
<L>For fellow subjects, rebels in his view,</L>
<L>Tells them his firm, his steady soul retains</L>
<L>Its iron purpose, and his heart remains</L>
<L><PB N="226" REF="013993_0006_0F9259298DC72D08"/>
Inflexible, determin'd to enslave,</L>
<L>And murder thousands he had sworn to save.</L>
<L>Remember Prince, the throne to George was giv'n,</L>
<L>T' asser, the cause of Liberty and Heaven,</L>
<L>But when he ceases Freedom to maintain,</L>
<L>And dares attempt, unaw'd by laws to reign,</L>
<L>When Heavens great cause is spurn'd at and forgot,</L>
<L>And horrid popish superstition taught,</L>
<L>The cause that gave the scepter then demands,</L>
<L>The same again from his unworthy hands,</L>
<L>Resign, proud man, with shame resign the throne,</L>
<L>And let contrition for your faults attone,</L>
<L>Or once again the call of Heaven attend,</L>
<L>And be your people's, not your minions friend,</L>
<L>Do this, and Britain may again forgive,</L>
<L>And let a tyrant thus repenting live.</L>
<L>Your hopes of conquest on North Am'rics coast,</L>
<L>Are blasted, and your expectations lost,</L>
<L>Your armies routed, and your Generals driven</L>
<L>Back to their fleets, the sport of angry Heaven;</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the night the three Generals, Burgoyne, Clin∣ton, and How, embarked for America, one of the most dreadful storms of thunder and lightning, took place, that has shaken the British channel in the me∣mory of man.</HI></NOTE> When they embark'd what storms convuls'd the pole,</L>
<L>What light'nings flash'd, what awful thunders roll;</L>
<L>'Tis God against you in his wrath declares,</L>
<L>These are his omens, and his thunder theirs,</L>
<L>Say can your madness stand the dire alarms,</L>
<L>Say can you meet Omnipotence in arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="227" REF="013993_0007_0F92592A6CBA0AF0"/>
<L>But hark, they call you from the realms of dead,</L>
<L>The dauntless souls that for their country bled,</L>
<L>At Concord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the dreadful engagement at that place on the</HI> 19th <HI>of April,</HI></NOTE> slaughter'd, lay the glorious train,</L>
<L>That met the British Tyrant with disdain,</L>
<L>They call for vengeance from the shades below,</L>
<L>And point at you the author of their woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My soul's on fire, distinctions are forgot,</L>
<L>I'll speak to tyrants as a Briton ought.</L>
<L>By thee our plains lie steep'd in human blood,</L>
<L>By thee our rivers pour a purple flood,</L>
<L>By thee the British glories are no more,</L>
<L>And vast destruction whelm'd th' Atlantic shore;</L>
<L>By thee our cities dread the dire alarms,</L>
<L>And horrid slaughters of fraternal arms,</L>
<L>Thy trait'rous ministers the deed design,</L>
<L>Thou giv'st assent, and the whole guilt is thine</L>
<L>Wave after wave, the mighty mischiefs flow,</L>
<L>Thick and more thick, the threat'ning dangers grow;</L>
<L>Impartial ages yet to come will read,</L>
<L>With secret horror each infernal deed;</L>
<L>Rend thee, like Stuart, from the rolls of fame,</L>
<L>And unborn millions curse a G—e's name.</L>
