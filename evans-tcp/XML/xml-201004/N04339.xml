<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB II. 9, 10.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Then said his Wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine Integrity? curse GOD and die: But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish Women speaketh; what? shall we receive good at the Hand of GOD, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his Lips.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have heard of the <HI>Patience of Job,</HI> and seen the <HI>End of the</HI> LORD; which some excellent <HI>Expositors</HI> have said was to give an early and <HI>illustrious Type</HI> of the <HI>Humili∣ation of</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>his Sufferings,</HI> in his Way to Glory and <HI>Exaltation,</HI> as our <HI>Intercessor</HI> at the right Hand of GOD.</P>
<P>Among the many excelling Examples and <HI>Patterns</HI> given us thro' the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> of <HI>Suffering</HI> Afflicti∣on and Patience, no One is more remarkable, noble and illustrious, teaching and affecting than that of JOB'S; in the surprising <HI>first and second</HI> Assault of <HI>Satan</HI> upon his <HI>Family, Estate</HI> and <HI>Person.</HI></P>
<P>The Sovereign and gracious GOD had prov'd <HI>his Grace</HI> in this his Servant in a long <HI>prosperous State;</HI> and now was pleas'd to make a sudden <HI>Change</HI> upon him, for an equal <HI>Display</HI> of the Power and Glory of his Grace in a State of <HI>deepest Affliction.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005366_0004_1018255D630AB400"/>
<HI>Satan</HI> was greedy of a Permission to tempt and <HI>sift</HI> him, as he afterward was to try <HI>Peter.</HI> The cruel <HI>De∣vil</HI> spoil'd him of his Substance, and bereaved him of his <HI>Children</HI> and Servants in one Day; and that in so terri∣ble and <HI>judicial</HI> a Manner as might speak most dreadful∣ly the immediate Hand and utmost Indignation of <HI>Hea∣ven:</HI> But failing of his <HI>Wish,</HI> hereby to provoke him to <HI>curse</HI> GOD; he ask'd a further Permission to <HI>smite his Body</HI> from Head to Foot, with <HI>Boils</HI> and fiery <HI>Ulcers,</HI> extreamly <HI>painful</HI> and tormenting, as well as <HI>filthy</HI> and loathsome. It was the Pleasure of <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> to permit <HI>this</HI> also, that the <HI>Trial of Faith</HI> in his <HI>chosen Ser∣vant</HI> might be found to <HI>Praise</HI> and <HI>Honour and Glory</HI> thro' all Generations of the <HI>Church</HI> on Earth, and at the <HI>Day</HI> of the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment.</P>
<P>But no Word <HI>amiss</HI> falling from the afflicted <HI>Saint,</HI> in this his <HI>destitute and tormented</HI> State; no Words but of <HI>profound</HI> Humility, Resignation, Worship and Thanksgi∣ving, dropping from his Lips; the subtle <HI>Tempter</HI> hav∣ing spent all his outward <HI>Forces,</HI> betook himself to his hellish <HI>Craft</HI> and Policy, and annoy'd his gracious <HI>Soul</HI> with diabolical <HI>Suggestions</HI> and <HI>blasphemous</HI> Thoughts a∣gainst GOD; to second him in which he excited his <HI>Wife,</HI> whom the spiteful <HI>Fiend</HI> seems to have left to him on Design to make <HI>her</HI> his <HI>Tempter</HI> and Tormentor.— So he afterward grieved our blessed SAVIOUR; against whom not prevailing by more immediate Assaults in the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> he us'd the unwary and rash Lips of <HI>Peter,</HI> and got him that just Rebuke, <HI>"Get thee behind me, Satan.</HI></P>
<P>Her Words in my <HI>Text</HI> are very <HI>gross,</HI> and smell rank of <HI>Hell; Then said his Wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy Integrity? curse GOD and die.</HI></P>
<P>I am not ignorant that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is capable of ano∣ther <HI>Sense,</HI> and that some make it a Piece of <HI>gracious Advice, "Bless God, and expire:</HI> But I adhere to our <HI>Translation,</HI> which perfectly agrees with <HI>Job's Reply</HI> to her; <Q><HI>Thou speakest as a foolish Woman! What, shall we receive Good at the Hand of GOD, and shall we not receive Evil?</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005366_0005_10182560157BF060"/>
Some think her Words spoken in Way of profane <HI>Sarcasm,</HI> from a vext and inraged Heart; q. d. <Q>Yes, <HI>keep on blessing GOD!</HI> for <HI>what</HI> I pray! for <HI>Plagues</HI> and Want? and to what <HI>Fruit?</HI> to <HI>perish</HI> praising! persist then, and <HI>die as a Fool dieth.</HI></Q>—But more <HI>simply</HI> taken, and as our <HI>Translators</HI> give 'em, they are a Piece of <HI>profane and furious Counsel;</HI> cast off thy Reverence of the DIVINE MAJESTY, and dare to reproach that GOD who can deal so hardly and <HI>unjustly</HI> by thee; notwith∣standing all thy religious Services and Worship, thy Devotion and Integrity; <Q><HI>Curse</HI> him tho' thou die for it; curse and <HI>provoke him to strike thee dead</HI> at once, and put an <HI>End</HI> to all thy Misery.</Q></P>
<P>I confess <HI>this</HI> Sense sounds very <HI>horrid!</HI> but not be∣yond the <HI>Devil;</HI> who <HI>dar'd</HI> to demand of the SON OF GOD himself, to fall down and <HI>worship him:</HI> And as HE then turn'd and rebuked the <HI>Tempter</HI> and drove him away; "<HI>Get thee hence Satan!</HI> Math. iv. 10. So <HI>Job</HI> in the Spirit and Strength of his REDEEMER turn'd to his <HI>Wife</HI> and rebuked <HI>her; Thou speakest as a foolish</HI> wicked <HI>Woman! What? shall we receive Good at the Hand of GOD, and shall we not receive Evil?</HI></P>
<P>These are Words of high and merited <HI>Anger</HI> and se∣vere <HI>Reproof;</HI> but like those of the <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> when contending with the <HI>Devil,</HI> there is no <HI>railing</HI> in them: The holy Man kept a Guard on his <HI>Lips,</HI> tho' no doubt his Soul was <HI>pierced</HI> with Horror at her Words. He de∣tested the impious Motion, and rejected it with Abhor∣rence, without a Moment's Hesitation. He might well call her a <HI>foolish Woman, rash</HI> and inconsiderate, and al∣so <HI>profane;</HI> as the <HI>Fool</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the <HI>Phrase</HI> of Scripture. —And then he more <HI>mildly argues</HI> with her; yet with a sufficient <HI>Resentment: What? shall we receive Good,</HI> and so <HI>much</HI> Good as <HI>we</HI> have done, in a long Course of <HI>high</HI> worldly Prosperity! and <HI>shall we not receive Evil?</HI> even <HI>such</HI> Evils, so <HI>many</HI> and <HI>mighty</HI> ones together; and break∣ing in upon us all <HI>at once,</HI> bereaving us of <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Houshold, Substance</HI> and <HI>Estate, Ease</HI> and <HI>Health;</HI> in such
<PB N="8" REF="005366_0006_10182562E70A5AB0"/><HI>sudden</HI> and <HI>awful</HI> Manner. Can any Thing be <HI>wrong</HI> or unjust that a <HI>good GOD</HI> orders to befall us? The Evil of <HI>Affliction</HI> comes from <HI>Him</HI> now, as much as all the <HI>Af∣fluence</HI> of worldly Prosperity that has heretofore distin∣guish'd us! and weigh now the <HI>one</HI> against the other; what <HI>Good</HI> we have receiv'd all the Days of our Life, and comparatively how few and <HI>light Afflictions;</HI> and then say, if we ought not to <HI>bear</HI> silently and patiently, and with adoring Submission, the <HI>Evils</HI> which He <HI>now</HI> pleases to lay upon us?</P>
<P>This was <HI>Job's</HI> gracious Way of <HI>Reasoning;</HI> these <HI>Thoughts</HI> had kept his own Spirit <HI>calm,</HI> and with the same he would <HI>lay</HI> the roil'd Spirit of his Wife, and <HI>stop</HI> her muttering and <HI>blaspheming</HI> Mouth.—The <HI>Good</HI> and the <HI>Evil</HI> of this <HI>Life</HI> are both <HI>from GOD;</HI> his <HI>Sovereign∣ty</HI> (abstracted from every other Consideration) accounts for <HI>both</HI> in our State of <HI>Trial:</HI> The <HI>least</HI> of the <HI>Good</HI> is not deserved, the <HI>Evil</HI> is <HI>all</HI> merited and much <HI>more;</HI> the <HI>Good</HI> is much <HI>more</HI> for Kind, Measure and Continu∣ance, thro' our whole Lives, than the Evil; the <HI>Good</HI> is at least necessary and what we could not <HI>subsist</HI> with∣out, the Evil what may be <HI>liv'd</HI> under and outliv'd. The most <HI>common</HI> Mercies of this Life are usually the <HI>great∣est</HI> and most needful. The <HI>Good</HI> is not only for Neces∣sity, but also for Delight; the <HI>Evil</HI> is no more than we <HI>need,</HI> and what we could not do <HI>well</HI> without: The E∣vil and the Good both come according to GOD's <HI>Cove∣nant-Faithfulness</HI> to his own People; the Evil is impro∣vable to the <HI>best Good,</HI> and 'tis the Will and Meaning of GOD that we so improve it; and (to have done) the <HI>Good</HI> which we receive from the Hand of GOD doth not always give to particular <HI>Graces</HI> an equal <HI>Lustre,</HI> as does the <HI>Evil.</HI>—Should we not then <HI>receive the Evil</HI> in this State of our <HI>Trial</HI> and Probation? Surely 'tis cal∣culated for <HI>it;</HI> the Honour of GOD requires it; there are <HI>passive Graces</HI> which our <HI>fallen</HI> State calls for the Exercise of; and CHRIST <HI>the Captain of our Salvation was made perfect thro' Suffering.</HI></P>

"That many of GOD's <HI>dear Children</HI> are often an∣noy'd with cursed and <HI>diabolical Suggestions,</HI> which He will never <HI>reckon to them as their Sin,</HI> because they do in their Souls <HI>abhor and reject them</HI> with utmost <HI>Detestation.</HI></P>
<P>This was <HI>Job's</HI> Case, and so it is of many a gracious <HI>Saint</HI> in our <HI>own</HI> Time: We see 'em terrify'd and pierc'd with <HI>hellish</HI> Suggestions, which they abhor, and are rea∣dy to <HI>shriek</HI> out at: they look on 'em as <HI>their own</HI> Wic∣kedness, and so at themselves as <HI>Devils</HI> almost: they <HI>loathe</HI> themselves on this Account, and <HI>cry</HI> to GOD for Deliverance, and are in <HI>Anguish,</HI> that ever such <HI>foul</HI> Thoughts should have <HI>Access</HI> to them, and as they ap∣prehend <HI>lodge</HI> within them: But what says my <HI>Text</HI> to 'em? even as GOD in it did to <HI>Job;</HI> "in <HI>all this</HI> they have <HI>not sinned.</HI></P>
<P>I am then in the following <HI>Discourse</HI> to speak to these <HI>three Propositions:</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the most <HI>upright</HI> and dearest of the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD in his Church on Earth, may be sometimes <HI>annoy'd</HI> and tormented with some of the most cursed and <HI>diabolical Suggestions,</HI> most injurious and dis∣honourable to the blessed GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That these <HI>hellish</HI> Thoughts and <HI>Injections</HI> should be most <HI>grievous</HI> and <HI>ab∣horred</HI> to their holy Souls, and <HI>rejected</HI> with utmost De∣testation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That then they are not <HI>their Sin,</HI> nor will ever be imputed to them by the <HI>Holy GOD.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. The dearest of GOD's <HI>Children</HI> in his Church on Earth may be at Times <HI>annoy'd and terrified,</HI> pursu'd and haunted by some of the most <HI>cursed</HI> and diabolical <HI>Sug∣gestions,</HI> most injurious and dishonourable to the blessed GOD.</P>
<P>If <HI>Job</HI> suffered thus in his Day, why not the most dear and pleasant <HI>Child</HI> of GOD in ours? Who among <HI>us</HI> shall be exempt from <HI>this,</HI> or any other Kind of <HI>fiery Trial?</HI> Nay, a greater <HI>than Job</HI> presents HIMSELF to us in the Front of the <HI>New Testament:</HI> Matth. iv. 1. <HI>Then was</HI> JESUS <HI>led up of the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>into the Wilderness, to be

And <HI>whom</HI> may not <HI>Satan</HI> use as a <HI>Tempter</HI> to another, when the <HI>Wife of Job</HI> was so abused by him, and afterward the Lips of <HI>Peter</HI> to blaspheme the Purpose and <HI>Decree</HI> of GOD, re∣specting the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> as unjust and impossi∣ble, to the very Face of CHRIST, and in the Presence of his <HI>Fellow-Apostles;</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. xvi. 22.

<P>When we consider <HI>Satan's</HI> using <HI>Job's Wife</HI> to <HI>vex</HI> his righteous Soul, and draw him into Sin and Rebelli∣on against GOD; it forces into our <HI>Remembrance</HI> his Malice and Subtilty from the Beginning, when he took the Form of the <HI>Serpent</HI> in his <HI>first</HI> Temptation, so <HI>fa∣tal</HI> to Mankind through all Generations.

Whereas he knows that in the Day you eat, your Eyes will be opened, and you will be like</HI> HIMSELF <HI>for Knowledge</HI> and Understanding. The malicious and false <HI>Fiend</HI> suggests to her, that from <HI>Ill-will</HI> and Envy GOD had forbid them the delicious and <HI>improving</HI> Fruit, and that the <HI>Threatning,</HI> by which he had

<P>I might mention <HI>two Instances</HI> more, which are <HI>famous</HI> in Scripture Story, of the <HI>Wives of good Men,</HI> used by the <HI>Devil</HI> to tempt them into <HI>ill Thoughts</HI> of GOD. The first is that of <HI>Zipporah</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> when she was ter∣rified into the <HI>Circumcision</HI> of her Son; for she saw her <HI>Husband</HI> struck <HI>sick</HI> on his Journey, and threatned with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ath</HI> for the <HI>Omission,</HI> and hereby <HI>disabled</HI> for the Duty; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he therefore cast the <HI>Foreskin</HI> at his Feet and said, "<HI>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Husband art thou to me.</HI> This is vulgarly inter∣pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d in Way of <HI>Passion</HI> and Wrath; and for ought I know 'tis the <HI>right</HI> Sense of the Words, after all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Criticism</HI> that has been bestowed on them, to make them bear another Sense.

If this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the real <HI>Meaning</HI> and Language of angry <HI>Zipporah,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>virulent Repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach</HI> do her Words imply against GOD and his gracious Law?</P>
<P>The other <HI>Instance</HI> I pointed at is <HI>Michal</HI> the Wife of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when shew saw him in his <HI>Transport</HI> of holy Zeal and Joy <HI>dancing</HI> before the <HI>Ark</HI> of GOD: She blasphe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the religious <HI>Act</HI> as <HI>leud</HI> and shameful; and as if it were below the <HI>Dignity</HI> and State of the <HI>King of Israel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isrobe and <HI>uncover</HI> himself so before the DIVINE MA∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Y.—Was it <HI>Michal</HI>'s Pride, or was it <HI>Satan</HI>'s Envy and Rage, that we must <HI>impute</HI> these Reproaches against GOD unto? Doubtless she was <HI>possess'd,</HI> the Devil was in her, and he fill'd her <HI>Heart</HI> with Contempt, and her
<PB N="13" REF="005366_0011_1018257239CDF558"/><HI>Mouth</HI> with Railings. She vilify'd GOD and his <HI>Ark,</HI> in reviling <HI>David,</HI> his Zeal and Devotion; and GOD laid her under Reproach, and made her <HI>vile</HI> for the rest of her Life.</P>
<P>But to <HI>return</HI> again: The <HI>Devil</HI> needs no <HI>Instruments</HI> by whom to tempt: He has Access to our <HI>Minds,</HI> if GOD do not restrain and forbid him, to raise and move evil Thoughts in us. He <HI>shoots</HI> his fiery Darts, and they <HI>enter</HI> we know not how; but we <HI>feel</HI> 'em pierce and fasten in our Souls. For <HI>how</HI> one <HI>Spirit</HI> acts on ano∣ther we know not; but <HI>this</HI> we know, that <HI>Satan can fill the Heart against the</HI> HOLY GHOST; as in the Case of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes the <HI>Devil has hurried</HI> poor Souls with <HI>Athe∣istical</HI> Thoughts; for he finds <HI>an evil Heart of Unbelief</HI> within us, and foments it at Times, to high Degrees of <HI>Infidelity;</HI> so as not only to question the <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and therein of JESUS, <HI>GOD manifest in Flesh;</HI> but also the very <HI>Being</HI> and incomprehensible necessary <HI>Perfections</HI> of the DEITY; his <HI>Eternity,</HI> perfect <HI>Prescience</HI> and <HI>Decrees;</HI> which are indeed as the <HI>thick Darkness,</HI> or rather <HI>unapproachable Light</HI> wherein the ETERNAL dwells; and into which it may be the <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven are no more allow'd to <HI>pry</HI> with any Thought of searching them out, than the <HI>Church</HI> of old in the <HI>Wilderness</HI> was permitted to come near unto the <HI>Bounds</HI> about the <HI>Mount</HI> to <HI>gaze;</HI> into which if they had <HI>look'd,</HI> what could they have <HI>seen</HI> but Cloud and Lightning?</P>
<P>The <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD are also special Objects of <HI>Satan</HI>'s furious Attack, in his Assaulting the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of GOD's Saints. And herein he does by the <HI>Members,</HI> as he did by the HEAD, in the forty Days of our LORD'S Temptation.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Asaph</HI> was almost <HI>born away</HI> headlong into Un∣belief and <HI>Despondency;</HI> though he had thrown out his <HI>strong Anchor</HI> and Cable, <Q><HI>Truly GOD is good to Israel, even to them that are of a clean Heart!</HI></Q> Yet could he scarce <HI>outride</HI> the furious <HI>Storm:</HI> Psal. lxxiii.—<HI>But as for me, my Feet were almost gone, for I was envious at the
<PB N="14" REF="005366_0012_10182575352197D0"/>foolish, when I saw the Prosperity of the Wicked:—Verily I have cleansed my Heart in vain, and washed my Hands in Innocence! But should I speak thus, I shall offend against the Generation of thy Children!—</HI> Yet <HI>was my Heart grie∣ved and I was pricked in my Reins; so foolish was I and ignorant, I was even as a Beast before Thee!</HI> For <HI>never the less I am continually with thee, thou hast holden me by my right Hand; and whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Rage and Blasphemy of the <HI>Devil</HI> is especially spent against the <HI>Faithfulness and Truth of GOD, in his Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatnings:</HI> he inrages the <HI>wicked</HI> very often by accursed <HI>Misrepresentations</HI> of the <HI>one,</HI> and would drive the <HI>Godly</HI> into <HI>Despondencies</HI> and <HI>Desperation,</HI> by impudent Denials of the <HI>other.</HI> He has a furious <HI>Antipathy</HI> to that <HI>Name</HI> of GOD which is the strong <HI>Tower</HI> of the righteous, and into which they are ever <HI>flying;</HI> for in it <HI>all his Glory</HI> passes before sinful Man; Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7. <HI>The LORD, the LORD GOD, mer∣ciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth; keeping Mercy for Thousands,</HI> &amp;c. The De∣vil <HI>stabs</HI> a Child of GOD to the Heart, and <HI>pierces</HI> him in the most <HI>sensible</HI> and tender Part, while he <HI>reproaches</HI> him, and makes him but seem to <HI>doubt</HI> the <HI>Goodness and Truth</HI> of GOD, his <HI>Covenant-Kindness</HI> and <HI>Faithful∣ness.</HI> No Wonder therefore if we find the most <HI>Emi∣nent Saints</HI> on holy Record thus afflicted and tormented by the <HI>Blasphemer</HI> and <HI>Avenger.</HI>—As <HI>Job</HI> was thus out∣rag'd in my <HI>Text,</HI> so were <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Asaph</HI> and <HI>Heman</HI> in their times, long after; for the <HI>Tempter</HI> is the <HI>same</HI> to all that are living <HI>godly</HI> in every Age; as <HI>they</HI> are much the <HI>same</HI> in respect of Faith and Infirmity▪ <HI>David</HI> tells us in Psalm xlii. how he went <HI>mourning because of the Oppression of the Enemy,</HI> who insultingly <HI>reproach'd him from Day to Day, "Where is thy GOD?</HI> It was a <HI>Sword in his Bones,</HI> more for the <HI>Name</HI> of his GOD than the <HI>Scorn</HI> cast on himself; <HI>the Voice of Him that reproach∣eth and blasphemeth! why art thou cast down O my Soul, and why disquieted within me? hope thou in GOD, for I
<PB N="15" REF="005366_0013_10182576F2C5AA58"/>shall yet praise Him.—Asaph</HI> was a like suffering <HI>Saint</HI> by like violent Temptations to <HI>Despondency;</HI> Psal. lxxvii. <HI>His Sore ran in the Night and ceased not; his Soul refused to be comforted; he remembred GOD</HI> (his Name, Perfecti∣ons, Promises and Works) and yet his <HI>Trouble</HI> remained or increased; <HI>his Spirit was overwhelmed</HI> while it <HI>made diligent Search; "Will the</HI> LORD <HI>cast off forever? and will he be favourable no more? is his</HI> MERCY <HI>clean gone forever, and doth his</HI> PROMISE <HI>fail forevermore? hath GOD forgotten to be gracious, hath he in Anger shut up his ten∣der Mercies?—I said, this is my Infirmity, I will remem∣ber the Years of the right Hand of the most High! Thy Way is in the Sea, thy Path as in the great Waters, and thy Footsteps are not known.—Heman</HI> also was a Man of like <HI>Sorrows,</HI> and of like <HI>Faith and Devotion:</HI> He has gi∣ven us a <HI>Psalm of Instruction</HI> to Souls <HI>in the lowest Pit, in Darkness, in the Deeps;</HI> Psal. lxxxviii. "<HI>O</HI> LORD <HI>GOD of my Salvation, I have cried Day and Night before Thee; let my Prayer come before thee, incline thine Ear unto my Cry; for my Soul is full of Troubles, and my Life draweth nigh unto the Grave;—why castest thou off my Soul, why hidest thou thy Face from me?

<P>In fine, it has often been the <HI>Complaint</HI> of humble and gracious Persons, that they have found themselves an∣noy'd with <HI>unaccountable irreverent, foolish, vile, filthy, base,</HI> abominable Thoughts; They know not <HI>what, how</HI> or <HI>why!</HI> but they seem to <HI>buzz</HI> about 'em like <HI>Swarms of Flies,</HI> or break about 'em like <HI>Sparkles of Fire;</HI> more especially when they would set themselves to <HI>meditate</HI> and <HI>pray,</HI> and have their Minds most <HI>solemn</HI> and <HI>compo∣sed</HI> and <HI>close</HI> with GOD in holy Exercises.—Now what shall we say to these <HI>Satanical</HI> Molestations and Distur∣bances? On the <HI>Serpent's</HI> part it is more <HI>easy</HI> to ac∣count for it, from his <HI>Spite</HI> and Malignity against GOD and his Grace; but on the part of GOD, his Permission
<PB N="16" REF="005366_0014_1018257AF5AFF908"/>of <HI>Baalzebub</HI> herein, and the <HI>holy Ends</HI> of his gracious Government; it may be more <HI>difficult</HI> for us to conceive aright.</P>
<P N="1">1. On the part of <HI>Satan</HI> it is obvious to account for it from his implacable <HI>Hatred</HI> of GOD, and of <HI>Souls re∣covering</HI> into his Holiness and Favour; from which he is himself utterly and forever <HI>excluded.</HI> He <HI>hates</HI> GOD because of his <HI>Holiness,</HI> and for his righteous <HI>Judgment,</HI> his Power and <HI>Vengeance;</HI> which it is his <HI>Torment</HI> to think of, and know it <HI>coming</HI> on him. So when the <HI>fierce Devils,</HI> "exceeding fierce from the <HI>Tombs,</HI> whi∣ther they had driven the <HI>two possessed,</HI> beheld their <HI>Judge, the</HI> HOLY ONE OF GOD in their Way, and were correc∣ted by his Power and stopt; Matth. viii. 29. <HI>They cried out saying, "What have we to do with thee;</HI> JESUS <HI>thou Son of GOD! art thou come to torment us before the Time?</HI> It is the Devil's <HI>Torment</HI> to behold Angels or Men holy and <HI>happy,</HI> while he is miserable. He hates GOD because he is <HI>unlike</HI> him, and under his <HI>Wrath;</HI> he spitefully hates to see GOD <HI>serv'd</HI> and glorify'd by others; he would pollute and damn our Souls, that we may be as <HI>he is,</HI> impure and odious to GOD. He af∣fects a <HI>Kingdom</HI> of his own on Earth, in Opposition to the Kingdom of GOD and of Grace. He could not bear to see <HI>Man</HI> in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and be himself in <HI>Hell;</HI> to see <HI>Adam</HI> in the Likeness and Love of GOD and wor∣shipping before Him, and <HI>himself</HI> cast from those Feli∣cities. <HI>Curs'd</HI> in his Rage on this Account, beyond a common damned <HI>Ghost</HI> I may suppose, he wishes for <HI>Millions</HI> and <HI>Worlds</HI> to follow by his Means into the State of eternal Miseries; and having beguiled our mi∣serable <HI>first Parent</HI> into an Apostacy from GOD, and finding <HI>himself</HI> only the <HI>more damned,</HI> and a SAVIOUR re∣vealed for the <HI>Sons of Men;</HI> and Him a singular and e∣minent SEED of that very <HI>Woman</HI> whom he had decei∣ved into Sin and Misery; his <HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> against all her natural <HI>Seed,</HI> but more especially against the bles∣sed and <HI>promised</HI> ONE Himself, and those that should <HI>be∣lieve</HI> on his Name, has been so <HI>inflam'd</HI>—that <HI>as a roaring
<PB N="17" REF="005366_0015_1018257D036DF1E8"/>Lion</HI> he drives thro' the World, (and is <HI>going up and down in it,</HI> which are his own Words) <HI>seeking whom he may de∣vour;</HI> And whom he cannot <HI>destroy</HI> he loves to <HI>distress,</HI> af∣fright and scare, <HI>terrify</HI> and wound; or <HI>worry</HI> if he cannot <HI>rend;</HI> and no wonder if he <HI>roar</HI> the more, when he <HI>sees</HI> and cannot <HI>reach</HI> his Prey; as in the <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> and Souls <HI>up∣right</HI> like him:— Or like a <HI>Dog</HI> rather he goes <HI>about the City,</HI> and haunts the Villages like the <HI>Wolf</HI> by night; grinning and barking at the <HI>Flock of</HI> CHRIST and his <HI>Lambs,</HI> whose <HI>Blood</HI> he thirsts after. So the HOLY GHOST has represented to us our <HI>Adversary the Devil,</HI> 1 Peter v. 8. shown us our <HI>Enemy</HI> and Danger: So that on the <HI>Temp∣ter's</HI> part it is <HI>easy</HI> to say, <HI>why</HI> he annoys <HI>Souls</HI> with his hellish <HI>Suggestions</HI> against the blessed GOD; he hates both GOD and them, and desires nothing more than to see GOD <HI>dishonoured</HI> and <HI>them</HI> polluted, that they may be damned.— This was his Wish and <HI>Hope</HI> in his At∣tempt on holy <HI>Job;</HI> to bring the <HI>Man of boasted Inte∣grity to curse his GOD;</HI> and for the same Reason he de∣sired to have the <HI>Sifting of Peter</HI> who was too ready to <HI>boast</HI> in himself; <HI>though all Men forsake thee, yet will not I:</HI> Luke xxii. 31. <HI>Satan has desired to have thee, to sift thee as Wheat:</HI> to have him for <HI>his own</HI> if it might be, and carry him off an <HI>easy Prey,</HI> if CHRIST had not <HI>pray'd for him that his Faith should not fail;</HI> but if <HI>that</HI> may not be, he desires however by <HI>winnowing</HI> to <HI>shake and toss him furiously,</HI> and show his <HI>Chaff.</HI></P>
<P>In short, as Dr. <HI>Tillotson</HI> has it: <Q><HI>Malice</HI> against GOD and <HI>Envy</HI> to Men account for <HI>Satan</HI>'s Tempt∣ing us; to <HI>spoil</HI> (if he can) GOD of his Subjects and <HI>debauch</HI> them from their Allegiance, into his own <HI>Con∣demnation,</HI> Malignity and Misery.</Q>—A <HI>Ghost in Hell</HI> does not presently commence <HI>Devil,</HI> in this Height of Ma∣lignity against GOD and Cruelty toward Fellow-Sinners; if we may take Leave to form an <HI>Idea</HI> to our selves by the Words which the <HI>Parable</HI> puts into the Mouth of the <HI>rich Man</HI> there; <Q><HI>Nay Father Abraham, but if one went to them from the Dead they would repent! Send Lazarus therefore to my Father's House, for I have five
<PB N="18" REF="005366_0016_1018257ECA81BA50"/>Brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they come</HI> also <HI>into this Place of Torment!</HI></Q> — The <HI>best Thing,</HI> I suppose, that was ever intimated with Respect to a <HI>lost Soul</HI> in Hell: but such a <HI>parabolical</HI> Representation means not to <HI>affirm</HI> any Thing with Respect to <HI>Hell</HI> itself, but only to <HI>affect</HI> and move the <HI>Bowels of Sinners,</HI> to them∣selves and others, in our <HI>present State</HI> of Probation and Repentance.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be more <HI>difficult</HI> for us to <HI>dive</HI> into the wise and holy <HI>Ends</HI> of GOD, in his <HI>Permission</HI> of these <HI>fiery</HI> Assaults of <HI>Satan</HI> upon the Children of his <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>It was a most <HI>dark</HI> Dispensation to pious <HI>Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends,</HI> when it was <HI>his</HI> Case: his <HI>Wife</HI> broke out even into <HI>Blasphemy</HI> upon it, and his <HI>Friends</HI> afterward <HI>rent their Garments,</HI> and sat down by him <HI>silent</HI> and astonied, <HI>wailing</HI> and in Fears: It amaz'd <HI>Job himself</HI> under the <HI>Conscience of his Integrity;</HI> and it threw his <HI>Friends</HI> into horrid Tears and <HI>Suspicions</HI> of some heinous <HI>Iniquity</HI> by which he had provoked the <HI>Wrath</HI> and Judgment of GOD in so <HI>many</HI> and heavy Instances of it at once: But while He now stands in the Eyes of some, as the <Q><HI>Hero</HI> of an inspir'd <HI>Epic.

1. The <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD must set us down <HI>silent</HI> under such <HI>astonishing Dispensations, Trials and Exercises</HI> of his most <HI>gracious Saints;</HI> nor may his <HI>Will,</HI> Wisdom, <HI>Goodness</HI> and Faithfulness be doubted, <HI>question'd</HI> or disputed by <HI>Them</HI> or others. It was (without Doubt) the <HI>Error</HI> of <HI>Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends</HI> that they enter'd <HI>so far</HI> into an <HI>Argu∣ment</HI> and Dispute about the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the <HI>Divine Conduct</HI> respecting him; which may seem too much verging to∣ward <HI>a Saying unto GOD, what dost thou?</HI> or <HI>why</HI> hast thou done this? which <HI>who shall say?</HI> Eccles. viii. 4. Therefore <HI>Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends</HI> receiv'd no other <HI>Answer</HI> from Heaven, either first by <HI>Elihu</HI> who spake un∣der a Divine Impulse and <HI>Inspiration,</HI> nor afterward by the more immediate <HI>Voice out of the Whirlwind,</HI> but the <HI>unaccountable Greatness, Majesty</HI> and most certainly <HI>wise and perfect Dominion</HI> and Government of GOD <HI>most High and Holy.</HI> All Flesh must be <HI>silent</HI> be∣fore Him; be <HI>dumb</HI> and not open their <HI>Mouth</HI> because GOD does it! be <HI>still</HI> and know that it is of GOD; like <HI>Aaron</HI> hold their <HI>Peace,</HI> like <HI>Eli</HI> say "<HI>It is the LORD!—Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends</HI> did but <HI>darken Counsel by Words without Knowledge,</HI> while they were ready to fix <HI>one Rule</HI> and Measure in all Providential Dispensations. We are let into the <HI>Secret</HI> and Reason in the <HI>Case of Job,</HI> that we may learn to rest <HI>satisfied</HI> in the Will of GOD, and the Dispositions of Providence, <HI>whatever</HI> befals our selves or others. GOD is wise and holy, and his <HI>Work perfect,</HI> in all Things that respect either his <HI>Children</HI> or his <HI>Enemies.</HI> We may neither say, "<HI>Why does the Way of the Wicked prosper?</HI> Or wherefore does GOD seem to <HI>look favourably</HI> upon the Way of them <HI>that deal trea∣cherously?</HI> And why do they <HI>devour the Man that is more righteous?</HI> without laying down to our selves, and that strongly, an immoveable Foundation, as the <HI>Prophet</HI> does, Hab. i. 12.13. "<HI>Art thou not from Everlasting, O</HI> LORD <HI>my GOD, my</HI> HOLY ONE? <HI>thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity.</HI> So when the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was ready to have <HI>pleaded with GOD,</HI> and was tempted <HI>to talk with him of his Judgments,</HI> he was <HI>inspir'd</HI> first to
<PB N="20" REF="005366_0018_1018258740247408"/>lay down this Principle, never to be departed from, but ever kept in Mind, "<HI>righteous art thou O</HI> LORD!</P>
<P N="2">2. As GOD will not suffer his <HI>upright</HI> Servants to be <HI>tempted</HI> above what they are <HI>able</HI> to bear, but will with the <HI>Temptation</HI> find a Way for their <HI>Escape,</HI> so his graci∣ous <HI>Purpose</HI> in permitting <HI>Satan's fiery Assaults</HI> on their Souls, is to <HI>glorify his Grace</HI> in their <HI>holy bearing</HI> and re∣sisting them, and so by the <HI>Weakness of Man</HI> to make the <HI>Triumphs of Grace</HI> the more glorious over the Sub∣tlety, Malice and <HI>Wrath of Satan.</HI> So it was in the Con∣flict of <HI>Job,</HI>—"Let me try his <HI>boasted Grace</HI> (said the <HI>Tempter</HI>) and he'll curse thee to thy Face; "He is in <HI>thy Hand</HI> (said GOD) and <HI>my Grace</HI> in him shall <HI>triumph</HI> gloriously over <HI>thy</HI> Spite and Power. Therefore when he held fast his <HI>Integrity</HI> under the <HI>first Scene</HI> of dread∣ful Trials, the ALMIGHTY even gloried in him over his false and cruel Enemy, Job ii. 3. "<HI>And still he holdeth fast his Integrity; although thou movedst me against him.</HI> And in the <HI>Record</HI> of these Sufferings and Patience of <HI>Job,</HI> the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD is glorified to his <HI>Church</HI> forever in the Power, the Riches and <HI>Alsufficiency</HI> thereof. The <HI>perfect Man</HI> came out of his <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second</HI> Fire, as the <HI>three Worthies</HI> did out of the <HI>fiery Furnace,</HI> without the least <HI>Smell</HI> upon him, or his <HI>Raiment</HI> so much as scorch'd: And as the LORD GOD OF HOSTS, the <HI>GOD of Israel</HI> was magnified in the Sight of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> and all the <HI>Princes</HI> of his vast Empire, in the one <HI>Miracle</HI> of Power; so is the Power of <HI>Faith,</HI> Patience, Penitence, Adoration, Submission glorified to the <HI>Saints</HI> of GOD in <HI>all Ages</HI> by the History of <HI>Job;</HI> and perpetual Glory is <HI>render'd</HI> by the Church on <HI>his</HI> Account from Age to Age. And how abundantly <HI>crowned</HI> then is that <HI>Trial of Faith,</HI> whatever it be, by <HI>manifold Temptations for a Season,</HI> tho' it be tried by <HI>Fire,</HI> which shall be <HI>found to Praise Honour and Glory</HI> unto the <HI>Day of Christ,</HI> and <HI>in</HI> that glorious Day, and unto all <HI>Eternity?</HI>— Thus has the LORD <HI>set apart</HI> some <HI>for Himself!</HI> And "they <HI>shall be mine</HI> says the LORD in the Day when <HI>I make up my Jewels! "Thou shalt tread upon the Lion and Adder, the young Lion and the

<P><HI>Satan</HI> would not <HI>chuse</HI> (we may well think) to <HI>disrest</HI> a Soul that is at <HI>Ease</HI> in Sin, but rather would <HI>soothe</HI> and rock him into a sounder <HI>Sleep:</HI> but the Tempter may be so <HI>infatuated</HI> at times, for ought we know, as to raise those Fears and <HI>Horrors</HI> in some under their <HI>first</HI> (and but common) Conviction, which he can <HI>never</HI> lay again, and which free Grace makes to <HI>issue</HI> in their saving <HI>Conversion.</HI> Or rather may we not think, that GOD having awaken'd the Soul, and <HI>Satan</HI> fearing to <HI>lose</HI> his hold of it, his <HI>Rage</HI> is over ruled to <HI>promote</HI> and carry on the good Work of GOD begun, and to <HI>drive</HI> the Soul faster and closer to its SAVIOUR.</P>
<P N="2">2.

The <HI>Tempter</HI> attempts, again and again, to <HI>blast</HI> the Work of Grace begun, to bring it to a <HI>stop,</HI> to deter and <HI>dishearten</HI> the pious Soul in its Way: <Q>there is a <HI>Lion</HI> in the street, an <HI>Adder</HI> in the Path! desist or turn back!</Q>— but GOD <HI>turns</HI> the affrighting Suggestion to Unbelief and <HI>Despon∣dency,</HI> into an <HI>Alarm</HI> unto <HI>Faith,</HI> holy <HI>Fear,</HI> Prayer and Fortitude; so that what was meant to affright astonish and <HI>deter,</HI> is made to <HI>quicken</HI> unto Prayer, Watchfulness and Diligence, in a more earnest Flight to the SPIRIT of Grace for Succour, and to the atoning cleansing Blood of a great SAVIOUR and INTERCESSOR: by which means you may have often found, O buffetted <HI>Child</HI> of GOD, that you had been less <HI>humble,</HI> careful, <HI>sollicitous</HI> and anxious about your spiritual State, and in your Walk with GOD, if you had never <HI>felt</HI> those <HI>Conflicts</HI> with your spiritual Adversaries, which a holy GOD has mercifully call'd you to endure, and has carried you through.

Job</HI> shone the <HI>brighter</HI> all his After-life in the Eyes of all about him; and it was to him the same Thing as if he had only been in the <HI>Mount with Moses,</HI> and came down with his <HI>Face.

I come now to the <HI>second</HI> Thing proposed, which is,</P>
<P N="2">II. These hellish <HI>Suggestions,</HI> and horrid <HI>diabolical</HI> Thoughts, as they should and will be most <HI>grievous</HI> and abhorred to a holy Soul, so ought they to be <HI>re∣jected</HI> and cast out with utmost <HI>Detestation.</HI></P>
<P>It is not only Matter of <HI>Fact</HI> and Experience, but also of <HI>Necessity,</HI> that they are thus <HI>grievous</HI> to and abhorred by a <HI>holy Mind:</HI> As it is <HI>Duty</HI> to GOD, so where <HI>Grace</HI> is in Exercise it is in the Nature of Things necessary. —<HI>Job</HI> appears in the <HI>Text</HI> as if <HI>stab'd</HI> to the Heart by his <HI>Wife's</HI> hideous Words; he <HI>answers</HI> the foul Temp∣tation with Abhorrence, he <HI>ejects</HI> the cursed Thought, he <HI>reprehends</HI> her with Indignation, and calls her a <HI>fool∣ish</HI> wicked Woman; and <HI>argues</HI> on GOD's Behalf, <HI>why</HI> utmost Reverence, Love, Fear, Gratitude, Adoration Submission was <HI>due</HI> from him to the <HI>blessed</HI> GOD, and should ever be <HI>render'd</HI> by him, by the Help of his Grace: <HI>What? Shall we receive Good at the Hand of the LORD, and shall we not receive Evil?</HI> Thus <HI>Grace</HI> will direct, urge and <HI>constrain us</HI> to think and speak in any like Case; as we know it was exhibited by our blessed SAVIOUR in his Temptations.</P>
<P>But let us take the <HI>Truth</HI> before us, the <HI>Duty</HI> pro∣pounded to us, in its several <HI>Parts,</HI> and briefly speak to each of them: These <HI>infernal</HI> Thoughts and <HI>Injections,</HI> should be very <HI>grievous</HI> and distressing to us, we should heartily <HI>detest</HI> 'em, <HI>reject</HI> and spue 'em out as soon as they arise in us, if we can; and at the same Time <HI>fortify</HI> our selves with holy <HI>Reasoning</HI> and Argument, as we are able; as <HI>Job</HI> piously and wisely did under the Direction and Assistance of GOD.</P>
<P N="1">1. They should be very <HI>grievous</HI> and distressing to our Souls, and they necessarily <HI>are</HI> so to a gracious Heart. <HI>As a Sword in our Bones</HI> it should be to us as it, was to <HI>David:</HI> Psal. xlii.—It is hard to hear our <HI>selves,</HI> a <HI>Parent</HI> or a <HI>Friend,</HI> any whom we esteem and reve∣rence, spoken evil of or <HI>reviled;</HI> but how much more dear and <HI>sacred</HI> is the Name and <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>GOD most
<PB N="28" REF="005366_0026_101825A01CA5A228"/>High,</HI> good and holy, wise and just, to a pious Heart? "<HI>Holy and reverend is his Name! Him thou shalt fear, to him thou shalt cleave and Him thou shalt serve! He is thy Praise and He is thy GOD.</HI> Deut. x. 20. <HI>That glorious and fearful Name, the</HI> LORD <HI>thy GOD.</HI> xxviii. 58.</P>
<P>It should be <HI>grievous</HI> to apprehend the <HI>Enemy of GOD and of all Righteousness</HI> so <HI>nigh</HI> us, and that by our <HI>Apos∣tacy</HI> from GOD he has such <HI>Access</HI> to us. It may well <HI>scare</HI> us to think that he is or has been (as it were) <HI>at our right Hand,</HI> and whispering into our <HI>Ear</HI> with a <HI>con∣tagious</HI> filthy Breath; Things so <HI>impious</HI> in themselves, and to us <HI>pernicious</HI> without the Succours of preserving Grace.</P>
<P>It should be <HI>horrible</HI> to imagine (but that the Heart is <HI>conscious</HI> to its own Wickedness) that <HI>Satan</HI> should see any Way of <HI>Entrance</HI> into us for his hellish <HI>Blasphemies,</HI> and Profaness! or that he should conceive the least <HI>Hope of Success</HI> against us, in such barefac'd Infidelity, <HI>Athe∣ism</HI> and Devilism! that he should seem to <HI>see</HI> us <HI>so like</HI> himself! or that any of the <HI>Humane Race,</HI> but especi∣ally under the Light of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> could be really <HI>such incarnate Devils,</HI> as this would render them.</P>
<P>We may well <HI>tremble</HI> with Horror from a pious <HI>Self-Love,</HI> lest those hellish Suggestions should make any Im∣pression, find the least Entertainment in us, or Compli∣ance from us. For sooner should we chuse <HI>to cease to be,</HI> then to be capable of <HI>regarding</HI> and yielding to a <HI>Thought</HI> of this Nature, against the Being, Holiness and Glory of the GOD that made us! which were to <HI>bring up Hell</HI> from beneath, and <HI>act the Devil</HI> in open Day-Light.</P>
<P>In a Word, It should grieve us to think or know that there is any such Degree of <HI>Malignity</HI> against GOD in any <HI>Creature</HI> whatsoever! That even <HI>Hell</HI> it self can show any Thing so vile and unclean. As one would be scar'd to see a <HI>Devil,</HI> so this <HI>Idea</HI> of diabolical <HI>Spleen</HI> and Hatred, and of <HI>spiritual Filthiness,</HI> may justly make our <HI>Blood</HI> run <HI>cold</HI> thro' every Vein, and the <HI>Hair</HI> of our Head to <HI>rise</HI> up an End!</P>

So grievous and terrifying have the <HI>blasphemous Sug∣gestions of Satan</HI> been to holy Souls, in whom the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD dwells and rules, having fill'd them with <HI>Faith and Love, Reverence and godly Fear.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We must therefore in our Souls <HI>detest</HI> and <HI>loathe,</HI> feel and express a vehement <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of such <HI>hellish Suggestions. "Do I not hate them, that hate thee?</HI> (said holy <HI>David,</HI> teaching us to <HI>feel</HI> and speak <HI>thus</HI> after him, Psalm cxxxix) <HI>and am I not grieved with them that rise up against Thee? I hate 'em with perfect Hatred,—I count them my Enemies: Search me O GOD and know Heart, try me and know my Thoughts, and see Thou</HI> and show to <HI>me</HI> if it be not thus.</P>
<P>What should our Souls equally <HI>detest,</HI> as this express∣ed open Enmity, Hatred, Contempt and <HI>Spite</HI> against the Holy GOD? At what should they equally <HI>rise,</HI> bursting with Anger <HI>Disdain</HI> and Wrath? <HI>Meekness,</HI> I had well nigh said, were here a <HI>Vice;</HI> and <HI>Mildness</HI> the Want of <HI>Zeal;</HI> did I not call to Mind the <HI>Arch-Angel's</HI> Words when <HI>contending with the Devil;</HI> how far he kept from any <HI>railing Accusation,</HI> but only said "<HI>the LORD rebuke thee.</HI> Provok'd <HI>Abishai</HI> could not preserve a <HI>like</HI> Government of himself when <HI>Shimei</HI> only railed against his <HI>Earthly King; "Shall this dead Dog curse my Lord?</HI> said he: But what would <HI>David</HI> himself have said, had the <HI>Curse</HI> been utter'd against his <HI>King</HI> and GOD, the LORD <HI>of Glory?</HI> The basphemous <HI>Being</HI> and his <HI>Act</HI> had equally been the <HI>hated of David's Soul,</HI> and should be of <HI>ours?</HI> Although there <HI>needs</HI> no imprecating any <HI>Curse</HI> upon the <HI>Devil, curs'd</HI> as he is long since from the Mouth of GOD, and under the Sentence of eternal Death.—"If any Man <HI>love not our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>let him be Anathema, Maran-atha,</HI> says the <HI>Apostle</HI> 1 Cor. xvi. 22.

I have put this <HI>Run</HI> of Scripture together, and as it were into the Mouth of tempted <HI>Job,</HI> to assist <HI>others</HI> when tempted to <HI>hard Thoughts</HI> of the blessed GOD, in strengthning and confirming themselves in their <HI>Adora∣tions</HI> before Him. In much <HI>fewer</HI> Words <HI>Job</HI> set the <HI>Temptation</HI> in its true Colours, as most unjust and <HI>base,</HI> ungrateful and <HI>impious;</HI> and what his Soul should <HI>never</HI> come into, GOD helping him; but keep at the greatest <HI>Distance</HI> from it.</P>
<P>It was the SPIRIT and Grace of CHRIST that thus <HI>ani∣mated Job</HI> and fill'd his Mouth with <HI>Arguments;</HI> for when JESUS was <HI>himself</HI> led by the SPIRIT into the Wilderness to be tempted of the <HI>Devil,</HI> he <HI>rebuk'd</HI> the filthy and impudent <HI>Suggestions</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> once and again, by giv∣ing his holy and irresistible <HI>Reasons</HI> from the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD; "<HI>It is written,</HI> said he, and again—<HI>it is writ∣ten:</HI> So it became <HI>Him</HI> who took our <HI>Nature,</HI> therein to be made <HI>under the Law,</HI> and to <HI>fulfil</HI> it; and whose <HI>Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> it was to say "<HI>Thy Law is within me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Joseph</HI> was the princely <HI>Type</HI> of CHRIST both in his <HI>resolute Repulse</HI> of the <HI>Tempter,</HI> the Devil in his <HI>Mistress;</HI> refusing to see or hear her; and yet <HI>arguing</HI> too <HI>the great Wickedness, and Sin against GOD;</HI> and also the foul <HI>Ingratitude</HI> Injustice and Villany to his <HI>Master:</HI> And when nothing would do with the impudent <HI>Creature</HI> he <HI>fled:</HI> An <HI>Act</HI> as <HI>heroic</HI> in its Circumstances, as <HI>David</HI>'s facing the <HI>Monster</HI> of a Man, the <HI>Defier of the Host of GOD.</HI>— In like manner, when <HI>David</HI> was outrag'd by <HI>Michal</HI> for the <HI>Transports of his Devotion,</HI> he bid her think if it were not <HI>grateful</HI> in him to <HI>dance before the LORD</HI> and his <HI>Ark,</HI> who had prefer'd him to her <HI>Father's</HI> House, and made him the <HI>King of Israel;</HI> "the devout will <HI>ho∣nour me</HI> said he, <HI>and I will be yet more vile than thus, and base in my own Eyes.</HI> 1 Sam. v. 22.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>Sin</HI> is never to be <HI>parly'd with,</HI> but at once and resolutely to be <HI>denied;</HI> yet is it the <HI>Act of Wisdom</HI> and Grace to <HI>reason with our selves</HI> for our Confirmation and Establishment in just and holy Resolutions; and with <HI>others</HI> for their Reproof and Conviction.

From this <HI>Artillery</HI> discharge upon the <HI>Hosts of Hell,</HI> and they will <HI>flee from you.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>rebuke</HI> the Tempter and <HI>refuse</HI> to sin: and when this is done, <HI>clench</HI> the Denial with the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> which sets before you the impious Nature of <HI>Sin,</HI> and the cursed Nature and End of the <HI>Tempter;</HI> our Rela∣tion and natural Subjection to GOD and infinite Obli∣gations to Him; his <HI>Laws</HI> Promises and Threatnings; and <HI>be</HI> the <HI>Christian fixed in his Post, strong in the</HI> LORD and in the <HI>Power of his Might, to withstand the Wiles of the Devil, and wrestle against Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, and spiritual Wicked∣ness in high Places:</HI> Think, what is <HI>holy</HI> and righteous, wise and good, Duty and Interest; and there <HI>fix your Foot,</HI> and <HI>stand,</HI> having your <HI>Loins girt about with Truth</HI> and having on <HI>the Breastplate of Righteousness.</HI> Commit yourself thus to GOD and to the <HI>Word of his Grace, which is able to keep you from falling.</HI></P>
<P>So far we have seen under the <HI>two first Propositions;</HI> that the <HI>dearest</HI> Children of GOD may be call'd to <HI>en∣dure</HI> the most <HI>foul</HI> and accursed Annoyances from the <HI>Devil;</HI> which will be unspeakably <HI>grievous</HI> to them and abhorred, and ought to be infinitely detested and in∣stantly <HI>rejected</HI> by them.—Yet if they cannot get <HI>rid</HI> of them, as they desire and <HI>strive</HI> to do, they must <HI>beware</HI> of a too <HI>intense contending</HI> with them; but <HI>turn away</HI> as from a barking <HI>Dog,</HI> or from an abusive raving <HI>Scold,</HI> or from a <HI>cursing Shimei.</HI>—As the heavenly Mr. <HI>Janeway</HI> advises in this Case, <Q>Let not <HI>such Thoughts</HI> have any Time of <HI>Abode</HI> in your Mind, but <HI>turn 'em out</HI> with all the <HI>Loathing</HI> and Abhorrence that you can; and with as <HI>little Trouble and Disturbance</HI> as you can; or else <HI>it pleases the Devil</HI> if he can but make you your <HI>own Tormentor.— Divert</HI> your Thoughts therefore to something good and <HI>holy,</HI> and let those very <HI>Injections</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="005366_0033_101825B58C0D6F18"/>be constantly the Occasion of some <HI>spiritual Medita∣tion,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> the <HI>quite contrary</HI> to the Blasphemy or infidel Suggestion: Or fall a <HI>praying</HI> with Earnest∣ness; and the <HI>Devil</HI> will be <HI>weary</HI> if he finds his <HI>De∣signs thus broken;</HI> and that those <HI>Sparks of Hell</HI> which he <HI>strikes</HI> into Souls to <HI>kindle</HI> and <HI>inflame Corruption,</HI> do but put <HI>Warmth into Grace,</HI> and set Faith and Prayer a working:</Q> He will be <HI>beat</HI> with his own <HI>Weapon</HI> when it is <HI>turn'd</HI> upon him, <Q>what he intended as <HI>Water</HI> to cool or <HI>quench</HI> your Love to GOD, proves like <HI>Oil</HI> to make it <HI>flame</HI> the more vehemently.</Q></P>
<P>I go on now to show in the <HI>last</HI> place,</P>
<P N="3">III. That these grievous and <HI>abhorred Injections are not the Sin of the dear Saints of GOD,</HI> nor will be <HI>reckon∣ed</HI> so by their <HI>holy and gracious GOD;</HI> nor do they <HI>de∣file and pollute</HI> their Souls, nor bring them under <HI>Guilt,</HI> when they are detested and rejected. This the <HI>Text</HI> is plain and positive in, "<HI>In all this Job sinned not.</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>strange</HI> to observe the dreadful <HI>Fears</HI> of many <HI>melancholly Christians,</HI> who are <HI>hurried</HI> and distressed with evil and wicked Thoughts which their Souls abhor; "That 'tis <HI>altogether</HI> (or very <HI>much</HI>) their <HI>own Wicked∣ness</HI> and Guilt; and they are ready to account and call themselves the most <HI>unbelieving and profane,</HI> the most <HI>pol∣luted and vile</HI> of any in the World; and to think that <HI>none have Hearts</HI> and Minds so <HI>alienated from GOD,</HI> and turn'd against Him as <HI>theirs:</HI> they <HI>impute</HI> all to them∣selves, and think themselves <HI>twofold</HI> more the Children of <HI>Hell</HI> than others! — Why is it <HI>thus?</HI> they are ready to <HI>ask,</HI> if there is not a <HI>Fountain of Impurity</HI> in <HI>Me</HI> more than in others, casting up <HI>such Mire and Dirt?</HI> Or if the Hand of <HI>Satan</HI> be in the <HI>troubling of the Waters,</HI> yet is it not plain he <HI>finds</HI> all this odious <HI>Filth</HI> at the Bottom in me? for which I should <HI>abhor</HI> my self and fear lest GOD abhor me!—And yet verily <HI>GOD sees not Iniquity

<P>The Support and <HI>Relief</HI> of such distressed Souls, and to <HI>convince</HI> them of their <HI>Error,</HI> I had principally in Mind in the Choice of this <HI>Subject;</HI> although I take it not to have been the very <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Case</HI> with <HI>Job,</HI> who was too <HI>intelligent</HI> and establish'd a Worshipper of GOD to be driven from the happy <HI>Confidence</HI> of his <HI>Integrity</HI> and Uprightness, by the Assaults of <HI>Satan</HI> or by the <HI>Argu∣ments</HI> of his <HI>Friends:</HI> He <HI>appeal'd</HI> from <HI>them</HI> unto GOD the Searcher of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and who knows all Things, that He <HI>knew he loved Him:</HI> Chap. x. v. 7. <HI>Thou knowest that I am not wicked!</HI> and in his <HI>last Reply,</HI> he finish'd with a long <HI>Train</HI> of noble <HI>Appeal</HI> to GOD and Affirmations to Men: Chap. xxvii. <Q>As GOD <HI>liveth</HI> who hath ta∣ken away my Judgment, and the ALMIGHTY who hath vexed my Soul; all the while my <HI>Breath</HI> is in me and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD is in my Nostrils; my <HI>Lips</HI> shall not speak Wickedness, nor my Tongue utter <HI>Deceit:</HI> GOD forbid that I should <HI>justify</HI> you; <HI>'till I die I will not deny my Integrity:</HI> My Righte∣ousness <HI>I hold fast</HI> and will not let it go; my Heart shall <HI>not reproach</HI> me as long as I live.</Q></P>
<P>But alas! how <HI>few</HI> of the dear <HI>Children of GOD</HI> in our Days arrive at like <HI>steddy</HI> full <HI>Assurance</HI> of Faith as <HI>Job</HI> had, respecting their <HI>Integrity!</HI> they are too often <HI>soon shaken in Mind;</HI> though we are admonished by the HOLY GHOST <HI>not</HI> to be so on one Account and another. 2 Thess. ii. 2. Even <HI>Ministers</HI> as well as common <HI>Dis∣ciples</HI> may be too justly likened to <HI>Reeds shaken with the Wind!</HI> and no wonder, when <HI>Peter</HI> himself was so easi∣ly carried away as the dry <HI>Stubble</HI> by a sudden <HI>Blast</HI> of Temptation, in his <HI>Self-Confidence,</HI> and after Warning given him by his LORD.</P>
<P>But what now lies before us, is to affirm and <HI>prove</HI> that there may be the <HI>foulest Motions</HI> to Sin, made by <HI>Satan</HI> to the Minds and Hearts of the most <HI>sincere</HI> and <HI>pious</HI> among the People of GOD; as <HI>this</HI> in the <HI>Text</HI> was to <HI>Job, "Curse GOD and die!</HI> and yet if their Soul

<P>Thus the <HI>evil One,</HI> the <HI>Prince of this World</HI> came first with <HI>Flatteries</HI> and Allurements, and afterward with <HI>Rage</HI> and Terrors, with all the <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> surround∣ing our blessed LORD, and <HI>found nothing in him; for in Him was no Sin.</HI> And if JESUS was thus <HI>tempted,</HI> yet <HI>without Sin;</HI> so if any of his dear <HI>Members</HI> are in like Manner tempted, and by his Grace are <HI>kept</HI> from yiel∣ding; by his <HI>Power</HI> are enabled to resist and <HI>rebuke</HI> the Temptation, it is by no Means <HI>Sin</HI> in them; but they are <HI>more than Conquerors thro' Him.</HI></P>
<P>Let us <HI>reason</HI> and argue a little on this <HI>Point.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The meer <HI>thinking</HI> on Sin, or the Contemplation of it with <HI>Aversion</HI> of Soul, can by no Means <HI>defile</HI> the Mind. GOD Himself <HI>beholds</HI> Sin, <HI>thinks</HI> of it, yet is infinitely <HI>holy,</HI> and of <HI>purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and cannot look on Iniquity.</HI> Hab. i. 13. i. e. He beholds it with <HI>Abhorrence,</HI> his <HI>Soul</HI> hates it, his <HI>Word</HI> forbids, con∣demns and threatens it. The holy <HI>Angels</HI> also see our Sins, open and secret, consider and detest 'em; are of∣fended at and grieved by them; and it is their <HI>Holiness.</HI> —<HI>Good Men</HI> make <HI>diligent Search</HI> and Enquiry into the Nature of <HI>Sin,</HI> their own and others among whom they dwell; discern the moral <HI>Evil,</HI> Guilt and Pollution of it; its Turpitude, Baseness and Malignity; yet are they not <HI>defiled</HI> hereby, no but the more <HI>purified</HI> both in Heart and Life.—Regenerate Persons and sincere <HI>Peni∣tents</HI> find it absolutely necessary for them often to call their <HI>past</HI> Sins to Remembrance; they can neither shew themselves <HI>Men</HI> nor <HI>Christians</HI> without doing so, for a renewed <HI>Repentance</HI> on the Account of 'em, to increase their <HI>Humiliation</HI> and Abasement before GOD, to quic∣ken themselves in the <HI>Mortification</HI> of the Body of Sin and Death which they carry about with them, to fix their
<PB N="40" REF="005366_0038_101825C4D45EE7A0"/><HI>Abhorrence</HI> of it and of themselves for it, and to strengthen their <HI>Watch</HI> against every Motion to it, from within or from without;—but all this is according to <HI>Godliness,</HI> and <HI>purifying</HI> to the Soul in <HI>obeying the Truth.</HI>—Now it is the same Thing in the Event, thro' the <HI>Grace of GOD</HI> with and in his <HI>Saints,</HI> if vile and wicked Thoughts a∣rise <HI>involuntarily</HI> in 'em, or are thrown and cast in upon them by <HI>Satan</HI> without and against their Will: If the Soul in either Case rise against them in <HI>Fear,</HI> in Mourn∣ing, in Hatred and <HI>loathing</HI> of them; Iniquity is but <HI>purged away</HI> hereby, and the Soul <HI>confirmed</HI> in holy Dis∣position, and the <HI>Habit</HI> of Grace is strengthned. As if you <HI>rinse</HI> a very foul Vessel, though it be in <HI>dirty</HI> Wa∣ter, yet it will be something the <HI>cleaner</HI> for it; the <HI>Dirt</HI> at the Bottom will be in Part (at least) loosned, and cast out with the Water; so here, though the Injection of <HI>Satan</HI> be never so unclean and defiling in it self, yet the Soul <HI>spuing out</HI> the foul Thought, <HI>casts up</HI> also something further of its natural Impurity together with it.</P>
<P>Indeed there is a Contemplation or <HI>thinking</HI> of Sin that is most <HI>impure</HI> and defiling: To think of it with <HI>liking</HI> and Complacency or Desire is highly so; to <HI>crave,</HI> intend, and project it, to muse and dwell on it with Pleasure, to <HI>roll it as a sweet Morsel under our Tongue</HI> with Taste and Relish; to recollect it with Delight and <HI>chaw</HI> it over again as the <HI>Cud,</HI> (which is to <HI>injure</HI> the wholsome Property of the <HI>clean</HI> Creatures) this is to <HI>listen</HI> to the Tempter with Inclination and Consent, and call the forbidden Fruit <HI>good</HI> for Sight and Taste, and is <HI>grosly</HI> polluting to the Soul; as also in a <HI>Degree</HI> it is, not to have our Hearts <HI>rise against,</HI> and <HI>fly from</HI> every Motion within us to known Sin. For in this Case <HI>Lust lodges,</HI> is <HI>harbour'd</HI> and entertained, <HI>conceives</HI> and brings forth; and is so much <HI>real</HI> Adultery, Murder, Profa∣ness of the Heart: Matth. v. 12. But on the contra∣ry, to think of <HI>Sin</HI> with Grief and <HI>Mourning,</HI> Fear and Confusion, Indignation and Rejection, this is <HI>purgative</HI> and purifying, <HI>wholsome</HI> and healthful, <HI>medicinal</HI> and
<PB N="41" REF="005366_0039_101825C7DDCF7070"/>restorative, nourishing and <HI>strengthning</HI> to a <HI>Principle of Grace,</HI> in <HI>Act</HI> and Exercise.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it be moreover consider'd, that the very <HI>Argu∣ment</HI> I am upon <HI>supposes</HI> the abhorred detested Thoughts <HI>injected by another,</HI> and that they do <HI>not come</HI> or proceed from the <HI>Soul it self,</HI> nor are originally its <HI>own,</HI> and that the Soul is <HI>grieved</HI> by 'em, <HI>offended</HI> at 'em, <HI>disowns</HI> and re∣jects 'em: they are therefore some <HI>spurious Births</HI> from abroad, laid <HI>secretly</HI> and basely at our <HI>Door,</HI> or with∣in it, and <HI>falsly father'd on us,</HI> if we are <HI>so foolish</HI> as to receive and <HI>own</HI> them. If we consent not, 'tis only the <HI>Devil's Sin;</HI> his Act, his Guilt and he must answer for it. If for Instance, the first <HI>Adam</HI> had done as the SECOND did; if our <HI>first</HI> Parents, had <HI>rebuk'd</HI> the Tempter and <HI>detested</HI> his Motion to them, when he persuaded them to <HI>disbelieve</HI> and disobey GOD; the <HI>Sin</HI> had rested only on the <HI>Devil;</HI> they had remained <HI>innocent</HI> and been <HI>confirm'd</HI> in Holiness; but they <HI>yeilded</HI> to his cursed Suggestion, took <HI>part</HI> in his Act and in his <HI>Apostacy</HI> from GOD.</P>
<P>Indeed, now in our <HI>fallen</HI> State we have just <HI>Reason</HI> to suspect our Selves and <HI>fear always,</HI> sometimes <HI>more</HI> than at other, whether the vile <HI>Motions</HI> to Sin within us be not from our <HI>own Hearts, which are deceitful above all things</HI> and desperately wicked; <HI>who can know them?</HI> No wonder therefore if the <HI>holiest</HI> Child or Servant of GOD be sometimes ready to say, <Q>I fear it is <HI>Sin dwell∣ing</HI> and reigning in me, and the Hand of the <HI>Devil</HI> is it may be <HI>little</HI> in it; for as St. <HI>James</HI> says "<HI>Every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lust and enticed;</HI> and how shall I <HI>know</HI> but that it is <HI>thus</HI> with me?</Q></P>
<P>But let us call in the <HI>Aid</HI> of the blessed St. <HI>Paul</HI> to set this matter in its true Light; and it is well for the <HI>Church</HI> that it has these <HI>two Apostles</HI> to give Light into each others Meaning. In the vii. <HI>Chap.</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> "the <HI>Apostle</HI> gives a Description of the <HI>Conflict between Grace and Corruption</HI> which he experienced in <HI>himself!</HI> and no doubt but every <HI>renewed</HI> sanctified Soul has more or less the <HI>like</HI> Experience. The <HI>Apostle</HI> calls himself
<PB N="42" REF="005366_0040_101825CB4636C260"/><HI>carnal and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld under Sin,</HI> because he at Times did that which he <HI>allowed not,</HI> but truly <HI>hated:</HI> but his Support and <HI>Relief</HI> was, <Q>that it was <HI>no more He that did it, but Sin that dwelt in him:</HI> for, the <HI>Good</HI> that he <HI>would</HI> he too often did <HI>not,</HI> but the <HI>Evil</HI> that he would not, that he <HI>did:</HI> Now (says he again) if I <HI>do</HI> that I <HI>would not,</HI> it is no more <HI>I</HI> that do it, but <HI>Sin</HI> that dwelleth in me: He goes on, I find then a <HI>Law</HI> that when I <HI>would do good, Evil is present</HI> with me: For I <HI>delight</HI> in the <HI>Law of GOD</HI> after the <HI>inward Man;</HI> but I see <HI>another Law</HI> in my Members <HI>warring against</HI> the Law of my <HI>Mind,</HI> and bringing me into <HI>Captivity</HI> to the Law of Sin! O <HI>wretched Man</HI> that I am, who shall <HI>deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI></Q>—The like spi∣ritual <HI>Conflict</HI> and <HI>lusting</HI> of the <HI>Flesh</HI> against the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and of the <HI>Spirit against the Flesh,</HI> was found in the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> at <HI>Galatia,</HI> so that <HI>they could not do the Things that they would.</HI> Gal. v. 17.</P>
<P>We see here that a <HI>good Man</HI> may have this <HI>Rejoic∣ing,</HI> <Q>the Testimony of his <HI>Conscience</HI> to his <HI>Complacen∣cy</HI> in the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD, and that his highest <HI>Pleasure</HI> in Life is, when <HI>Heart and Life</HI> are in the strictest Conformity to the Law and <HI>Will of GOD;</HI> and that with <HI>his Mind</HI> he is <HI>serving the Law of GOD;</HI> and yet at Times, <HI>hold himself</HI> no better than one brought into <HI>Captivity</HI> to the Law of <HI>Sin,</HI> a <HI>carnal Creature, and sold under</HI> it:</Q> And yet he must <HI>not impute</HI> to his <HI>own Will</HI> and allowance the <HI>Evils</HI> which he <HI>bewails, groans</HI> out un∣der, <HI>strives</HI> against and <HI>hates</HI> himself for. To this <HI>he</HI> must recur, "It is <HI>no more I</HI> that do it, but <HI>Sin</HI> which dwelleth in me; a <HI>Body of Death</HI> which I am hourly <HI>groaning,</HI> for a <HI>full</HI> Deliverance from.—It is the Experi∣ence and <HI>Confession</HI> of the <HI>holiest Saints</HI> on Earth, that there are sad <HI>Remains of Impurity</HI> and Uncleanness clea∣ving to them; the <HI>Filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit,</HI> which are <HI>defiling</HI> to their best <HI>Frames</HI> and Duties; and too often <HI>lusting</HI> strongly and at Times <HI>prevalently;</HI> so that the <HI>Good</HI> which they <HI>desire</HI> to do they too often <HI>do not,</HI> and the <HI>Evil</HI> which they <HI>wou'd not</HI> they at Times

<P>In short, All <HI>Sin</HI> is voluntary; the <HI>Will</HI> is in it, the <HI>Choice</HI> is of it, the Soul <HI>likes</HI> it, and hence <HI>Guilt</HI> arises. — All that I shall further <HI>add</HI> on this Argument, to carry it to the utmost <HI>Evidence</HI> and Demonstration, is</P>
<P N="3">3. There is not only <HI>no Sin,</HI> but <HI>much Vertue;</HI> a no∣table Exercise of <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Victory</HI> over Temptation, in the <HI>Case</HI> supposed; when <HI>blasphemous</HI> Tho'ts arising in us, or violently suggested to us, are <HI>abhorred</HI> by us, de∣tested and <HI>rejected.</HI> Violent Temptations to hideous Sin are hereby resisted, refused and <HI>overcome:</HI> And how <HI>far</HI> is this from the committing Sin, or <HI>contracting Guilt?</HI> GOD, the righteous <HI>Judge</HI> reckon'd it to <HI>Job</HI> for <HI>Righ∣teousness,</HI> and his <HI>Triumph over Satan; still he holdeth fast his Integrity! although thou movedst me against him, to de∣stroy him without a Cause.</HI></P>
<P><Q>This added to his <HI>Character,</HI> (says Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> on the Place) turn'd to his <HI>Praise and Glory!</HI> GOD him∣self speaks of it with a kind of Pleasure and <HI>Wonder,</HI> and of <HI>Triumph</HI> in the Power of his own <HI>Grace!</HI> He stands the <HI>faster,</HI> and <HI>holds</HI> the faster, for being shaken!
<PB N="44" REF="005366_0042_101825D107E16520"/><HI>still</HI> he does so; after so <HI>violent</HI> an Assault upon him! he has <HI>got Ground</HI> instead of losing any! his <HI>Constancy</HI> shows proves and <HI>crowns</HI> his Integrity! He is more hearty and <HI>lively</HI> than ever in <HI>blessing Me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Job</HI> approv'd himself the perfect and <HI>upright Man,</HI> one that feared GOD and <HI>eschewed Evil;</HI> and that there was <HI>none like him</HI> on the Earth: None <HI>tried,</HI> temp∣ted and afflicted like him in his Day, or since among meer Men, or that <HI>bore</HI> Temptations of like Kind and Degree, so many and great, with like <HI>Heroic</HI> Piety and Fortitude. — The <HI>Tempter</HI> could not but own himself <HI>beat,</HI> and GOD <HI>justified</HI> in all that He had said of his penitent, patient, believing faithful <HI>Servant.</HI></P>
<P>GOD meant and allow'd the <HI>Trial,</HI> that it might stand on <HI>Record</HI> for the Comfort of his <HI>tempted Saints,</HI> and for the Edification of his <HI>Church</HI> for ever. It is a <HI>Banner display'd</HI> for others to <HI>fight</HI> under, in the Cause of <HI>Truth</HI> and Holiness, to the End of the World. <HI>Job</HI> has help'd many a weak and strong <HI>Believer</HI> to beat the Devil again and again, down to our own Days. He still <HI>sits as a King in the Army;</HI> and <HI>what Hosts</HI> of suffering Saints are <HI>still fighting</HI> under and after him, and conquering by <HI>Faith in his</HI> REDEEMER.</P>
<P>And by every Fight and <HI>Victory</HI> they certainly get some further <HI>Strength</HI> and Power against Sin, and <HI>Con∣firmation</HI> in Grace; even as <HI>the Testimony of</HI> CHRIST <HI>was confirmed</HI> in the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and they <HI>confirmed to the End;</HI> that they might be <HI>blameless in the Day of</HI> CHRIST: 1 Cor. i. 6, 8. <HI>Satan</HI> also is more and more <HI>bruised under the Feet</HI> of GOD's People; and like the conquering <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> they will be <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll'd by</HI> JESUS to set their <HI>Feet</HI> on the <HI>Necks</HI> of the <HI>Principalities and Powers of Darkness;</HI> and the <HI>Promises</HI> of both <HI>Testaments</HI> will be fulfilled to them and in them; "<HI>thou shalt tread upon the Lion and the Adder; on Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the Power of the Enemy,</HI> Psal. xci. Luk. x. So <HI>Light is sowing for the righteous,</HI> in the Hours of greatest <HI>Darkness;</HI> and the humble <HI>Disciples of</HI> JESUS will one Day like the <HI>Seventy</HI> return with <HI>Joy</HI> to Him, saying, "LORD, <HI>even

<P>The Day is coming when <HI>the Saints shall judge the World, shall judge Angels!</HI> Then they shall see <HI>their Enemy,</HI> the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> the <HI>Devil and Satan</HI> at the <HI>Bar</HI> of CHRIST their <HI>Saviour,</HI> and <HI>damn'd</HI> and cast into the <HI>Lake of Fire!</HI> Then having follow'd CHRIST in the <HI>Re∣generation</HI> they shall <HI>sit down with him on his Throne!</HI> Then having drank of <HI>his Cup</HI> and been baptized with <HI>his Baptism,</HI> they shall sit on his <HI>right Hand</HI> and on his <HI>left</HI> in his Kingdom! — Let 'em realize now by <HI>Faith</HI> how full will be their <HI>Joy,</HI> how bright their <HI>Glory,</HI> how high their Honour, how <HI>wide</HI> their <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Renown</HI> in that illustrious <HI>Day!</HI> They <HI>Conquerors</HI> and <HI>more</HI> than Conquerors! and so their <HI>Triumphs</HI> more than <HI>August</HI> or <HI>Roman;</HI> Divine, Coelestial and Eternal!— Wherefore <Q>my beloved <HI>Brethren,</HI> count it <HI>all Joy</HI> when ye fall into diverse <HI>Temptations,</HI> yea the most <HI>fiery</HI> Trials; for blessed is the Man that <HI>endureth</HI> them, for when he is <HI>tried</HI> he shall receive the <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> which the LORD hath <HI>promised</HI> to them that love Him: But let <HI>Patience</HI> have its <HI>perfect</HI> Work, that ye may be perfect and <HI>entire</HI> wanting nothing.</Q> <HI>James</HI> i. 2, 3, "4, 12.</P>
<P>I close with some Words of the very Reverend and pious Dr. <HI>Horneck</HI> on this Argument: <Q><HI>Unallowed blasphemous</HI> and other <HI>wicked</HI> Thoughts in the Heart <HI>do not defile it:</HI> This <HI>Doctrine</HI> must be often incul∣cated, because of the great Number of <HI>pious Souls</HI> who look upon themselves as the <HI>vilest Wretches</HI> in the World, and are ready to run into <HI>Desperation,</HI> because so many <HI>horrid</HI> Tho'ts and <HI>filthy</HI> Suggestions present themselves to their Minds; more especially disturb∣ing them in their <HI>Devotions</HI> and religious Exercises: But not being <HI>allow'd</HI> of, nor <HI>consented</HI> to; however dreadful and <HI>hainous</HI> they are in themselves, they <HI>no more defile the Heart</HI> than <HI>boisterous Winds,</HI> and the

The <HI>Soul</HI> in this Case is like the <HI>young Men in the fiery Furnace;</HI> while a thousand <HI>Sparks</HI> fly about them, not a hair of their Head is singed.</Q></P>
<P>To have done, — In every <HI>Congregation</HI> almost there are some whose <HI>Case</HI> this is: Some are <HI>known</HI> to us, and there may be others: To <HI>all such</HI> I have bro't the <HI>Mind</HI> of GOD and they must make <HI>Conscience</HI> of receiv∣ing it as <HI>from Him:</HI> Wherefore <HI>comfort</HI> your selves to∣gether, and <HI>edify</HI> one another: <HI>Comfort the Feeble-mind∣ed, and support the Weak: And the very</HI> GOD <HI>of Peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray GOD your whole Spirit Soul and Body be preserved blameless unto the Coming of our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST: <HI>Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus in some poor manner and measure en∣deavoured to show, that the most <HI>pious</HI> and gracious Persons in the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD on Earth, may be <HI>annoyed</HI> with most accursed <HI>hideous</HI> Tho'ts and Suggestions against the Blessed GOD, his Truths and Laws; which ought to be and will be very <HI>grievous</HI> to and <HI>abhorr'd</HI> by them, and should be <HI>rejected</HI> instantly with <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>station,</HI> or rather with a <HI>holy Disdain</HI> and Contempt; and that when they are so they are <HI>not our Sin,</HI> and will never be <HI>reckon'd</HI> a∣gainst us as our Sin by GOD our righteous and gracious JUDGE; and that not only is there <HI>no Sin</HI> in this Case com∣mitted by the grieved and <HI>distressed</HI> Soul, flying to CHRIST for <HI>Refuge</HI> and Protection; but indeed there is the <HI>true Exercise of Grace</HI> and <HI>Victory</HI> over Sin; <HI>true Grace</HI> is tried, proved, display'd and triumphant before the Eyes of the <HI>invisible Hosts</HI> and Armies of the <HI>Living GOD,</HI> as really as

<P>I proceed therefore to the USE and IMPROVEMENT of the Subject; and though the <HI>principal</HI> Part thereof must be to <HI>relieve</HI> and <HI>direct</HI> (by the Will of GOD) <HI>distressed Souls</HI> under the Annoyances of <HI>Hell;</HI> yet there being also many weighty <HI>Inferences</HI> that offer to us by Way of <HI>Instruction, Caution, Conviction, Counsel</HI> and <HI>Direction,</HI> as well as of Support and <HI>Comfort</HI> to the Soul that is <HI>tempted</HI> and weary; I shall take <HI>those</HI> in my Way also.</P>
<P N="1">I. First then by Way of <HI>Inference</HI> and <HI>Instruction,</HI> I shall recollect and mention some <HI>Truths</HI> of great Im∣portance, naturally <HI>flowing</HI> from what has been already said, and indeed all along <HI>implied</HI> and supposed therein:</P>
<P>As, 1. The <HI>cursed Nature of Sin,</HI> the <HI>hideous Fruit</HI> of the Creature's <HI>Apostacy</HI> from GOD; and the <HI>Malignity</HI> against Him that is in our <HI>corrupt Nature:</HI> We may here take a near and full <HI>View</HI> of the deformed <HI>Face,</HI> the o∣dious and filthy <HI>Features</HI> of SIN; as it <HI>lusts in us</HI> a∣gainst the blessed GOD; and to what a <HI>Degree</HI> it would exceed, if the <HI>Word,</HI> SPIRIT and Grace of GOD did not <HI>restrain</HI> and prevent it.</P>
<P>For, are there then the <HI>Seeds</HI> of this <HI>Atheism and Blas∣phemy</HI> and Rage against GOD in us, if he should <HI>leave</HI> us to our selves, or deliver us up to <HI>Satan</HI> to sift us? Are our <HI>Hearts so evil</HI> as to have the least Propensity to such detestable <HI>Impieties?</HI> Can <HI>Satan</HI> see it possible to bring us into them?

<PB N="48" REF="005366_0046_101825DBD0586AF0"/>Where <HI>only</HI> (one would think) such a Thing can be imagined as a <HI>blaspheming</HI> because of their <HI>Plagues!</HI> — If <HI>Sin</HI> tends even to <HI>this</HI> here on Earth; or if it has ever turn'd Angels and Men into such <HI>Devil;</HI> into the worst and <HI>last</HI> Degrees of such Malignity against the most good, most holy perfect and blessed GOD; the Author of all <HI>Being</HI> Perfection and Blessedness; — O what an EVIL is it?

For what <HI>Shame</HI> have we chang'd our Glory?—And consequently, what Humi∣liation, what Mourning, Self-loathing and Abhorrence, what Fear and <HI>Jealousy</HI> for our selves does our fallen State call for?

<PB N="49" REF="005366_0047_101825DDA47C8F98"/>are they <HI>distinct</HI> Inferences, and to be briefly spoken to <HI>each</HI> by themselves.</P>
<P N="1">1. Doubtless there is a <HI>Devil;</HI> a <HI>Tempter</HI> of a most accursed Nature; the Exciter of these hated <HI>Tho'ts</HI> which <HI>haunt</HI> at times some of the dear Children of GOD, and grievously distress and terrify 'em; unavoidably rising in their Minds, as if the Blasphemy where <HI>whisper'd</HI> in their Ear and urg'd upon them. Not that the Devil <HI>knows</HI> our Tho'ts always, tho' he may shrewdly <HI>guess</HI> at 'em; nor can he make us think or hinder our think∣ing as he <HI>will;</HI> nor in any Manner or Degree but as he is <HI>permitted:</HI> Never the less that there are wicked, lying, profane, spiteful <HI>Spirits</HI> that do find a near <HI>Access</HI> to the Minds of godly Persons, and have <HI>Pleasure</HI> in wor∣rying and tormenting them, has been by many sadly experienc'd.—It's true that this is the Lot of <HI>some</HI> only, and those ordinarily more or less subject to Fear and <HI>Melancholly:</HI> but then it is to be considered also, that GOD <HI>permits not</HI> the Devil to persecute <HI>whom</HI> or <HI>when</HI> he pleases after this hideous Manner, as he could not come at <HI>Job</HI> 'till GOD gave him Permission; and that such Kind of Annoyances will presently make Persons <HI>sad</HI> and melancholly; for what is more <HI>dejecting</HI> in it∣self? The <HI>Devil</HI> also may doubtless discern when and where there is most Likelihood of <HI>succeeding</HI> in his Temp∣tations of one <HI>kind</HI> and of another, and apply them ac∣cordingly: He persecutes the more soft and <HI>timorous</HI> Temper with <HI>black</HI> and gross Suggestions, while he sel∣dom tempts the <HI>sanguine</HI> free and gay Minds to Melan∣cholly; no, but to licentious Airs and careless Jollity: he fishes with the <HI>Bait</HI> that is likeliest to <HI>take</HI> with the Constitution of Nature, the Circumstances of Life; or with the alter'd <HI>Frame</HI> of Persons under the <HI>Changes</HI> that pass over them.— But to return,</P>
<P>One Proof of a <HI>Devil,</HI> or malignant Nature imploy∣ing it self against GOD, is had in the inward <HI>Persecuti∣ons</HI> that piously disposed Minds are made to suffer in <HI>vile</HI> and odious Tho'ts, which they resist, cry out of, and fly from, but can't rid themselves of. Here is <HI>Satan</HI> as
<PB N="50" REF="005366_0048_101825E054760598"/>plainly to some suffering Souls, and unto them that are made acquainted with their Distresses, as his bodily <HI>Pos∣sessions</HI> have been frequently undoubted, where the <HI>possessed</HI> have been agitated, rent and torn by him, in hor∣rible Manner, in the Sight of others.</P>
<P>That there is a GOD we know by <HI>his Works,</HI> and that He is a most wise, powerful and infinitely <HI>good</HI> BEING; because these his <HI>Divine Perfections</HI> do gloriously appear in them: In like manner that there is a <HI>Devil,</HI> or Spiritual <HI>Wickednesses</HI> in high Places, is evident and notorious from many palpable <HI>Effects,</HI> which prove him a Being <HI>apostate;</HI> base, envious, malicious, cruel, outrageous against GOD and <HI>Goodness.</HI>—The Temptations to <HI>Sin</HI> which we feel our <HI>selves,</HI> and see the <HI>World</HI> of Mankind carried away with, and hear the <HI>Good</HI> and Virtuous groan under the Annoyance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, are a sufficient Proof of a World of <HI>Devils,</HI> that like cunning <HI>Serpents,</HI> or roaring <HI>Lions</HI> are <HI>lurking</HI> or <HI>walking</HI> about, to bite and devour.</P>
<P>This was so palpable to the <HI>Heathen</HI> World, that many of them came into the Imagination of <HI>two</HI> Principles; the One of all <HI>Good,</HI> the other of all <HI>Evil;</HI> and they ignorantly worship'd the <HI>One</HI> with Love and Venera∣tion, the <HI>other</HI> with Dread and Horror: But Reason and <HI>Revelation</HI> has banished this ridiculous and inconsistent Thought from the <HI>Christian</HI> World; the Word and Works of GOD concurring in this plain Account of <HI>Him,</HI> that HE the <HI>first Cause</HI> of all Things is necessarily and infinitely <HI>good;</HI> and that <HI>Evil</HI> is only from the Creatures <HI>Apostacy</HI> and Rebellion against GOD, Opposition to his <HI>Will</HI> and Enmity against it: For there needs only a <HI>Deflexion</HI> from what is <HI>good</HI> and right, to make <HI>Sin</HI> and Evil.</P>
<P>We find therefore some apostate <HI>Intelligences,</HI> besid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our own wicked Hearts, suggesting Evil to us, and per∣swading to it with Importunity and Vehemence, and sometimes with Violence and Virulence, even to our <HI>own</HI> Horror and Loathing at Times (evil and wicked as we are) and to our exquisite Pain and Anguish; and what can we impute <HI>this</HI> to but a <HI>Devil?</HI> Or what can
<PB N="51" REF="005366_0049_101825E41CC60720"/>we infer from it but the Being of such a <HI>cursed Spirit,</HI> the Enemy of GOD's Glory and of our Holiness and Happiness.</P>
<P>This Argument I find in <HI>Zanchius,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Unde hae malae, <HI>invitae</HI> Cogitationes? Non a <HI>Nobis</HI> quia invitae; non a <HI>Deo</HI> ne{que} bonis Angelis, quia malae; ergo a <HI>Diabolis.</HI></NOTE> Whence are those evil and <HI>impious Thoughts</HI> and Motions forcing in upon us? not from our <HI>selves,</HI> for they are against our <HI>Wills;</HI> not from GOD or <HI>good Angels</HI> because they are so <HI>wic∣ked;</HI> therefore they must be from <HI>Satan;</HI> some invisi∣ble <HI>Evil One,</HI> even fuller of explicit Spite and Rancour against GOD and Holiness than our <HI>own</HI> corrupt Hearts appear.</P>
<P>To use the Words of the Venerable and judicious Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> here,—<Q><HI>Temptations</HI> (says he) are some∣times so <HI>unnatural,</HI> so importunate and violent, that the <HI>Person</HI> tempted even feels something without himself, perswading and urging him: He can nei∣ther be <HI>alone,</HI> nor go about his <HI>Calling,</HI> but he is fol∣low'd and <HI>dog'd</HI> with earnest Motions to Sin; and unto <HI>Sins</HI> too to which he never found himself in∣clin'd; Sins which he has no Pleasure in, nor Pros∣pect from; Sins that are quite against the Tempera∣ture of his Body, and the Desire of his Mind.</Q> — Truly, a <HI>Mind thus persecuted</HI> will need no <HI>Argument</HI> scarce, beside its own <HI>Sense</HI> and Experience, to satisfy it "that there is a <HI>Devil,</HI> its <HI>Adversary,</HI> which desires his Annoyance, Defilement, Damnation.</P>
<P N="2">2. From hence likewise it appears, what a <HI>hateful Spi∣rit</HI> the Devil is; and how abhorr'd and abominable he should be to us; how loath'd and fear'd and detested by us.—What just <HI>Cause</HI> does he give us to <HI>hate</HI> him, if this be his Rage and Malice against us? or much ra∣ther if he move us thus at any time against the Blessed GOD! would have us blaspheme HIM, <HI>curse</HI> him, and entertain odious Thoughts of Him! — <HI>cursed Spirit,</HI> a Hater of GOD, and hated by GOD, — should not <HI>we</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="005366_0050_101825E71AD32060"/>hate him? Psal. cxxxix. ult. "<HI>Do I not hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee?</HI> And am I <HI>not grieved with them that rise up against Thee? I hate them with perfect Hatred, I count them mine Enemies.</HI> We can have no other Idea of a <HI>Devil,</HI> as such, but as most <HI>odious</HI> and accursed! And the more strongly <HI>Grace</HI> is rooted, and <HI>Goodness</HI> rul∣ing in us, the <HI>more</HI> must he be an <HI>Execration</HI> to us. <HI>Ha∣tred</HI> was made for such an Object, as much as <HI>Love</HI> for GOD most good and holy.</P>
<P>More especially how should <HI>we</HI> hate to be <HI>our selves</HI> like unto such an <HI>odious</HI> Creature as <HI>Satan!</HI> or to be un∣der his Power, possessed and acted by him, or obedient to him! of such a <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Devil, doing his Lusts!</HI> how should this make us abhor our own <HI>Souls,</HI> our own Being! for how odious must we then be to the blessed GOD! how accursed in the Sight of HIM that made us in his <HI>own Likeness</HI> and Love. Look into the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and see the soul Face in that <HI>Glass;</HI> "thou <HI>Child of the Devil,</HI> as truly as <HI>Elimas the Sorcerer</HI> was before thee! And of that <HI>wicked One,</HI> as much as <HI>Cain</HI> who slew his Brother, and went out <HI>blasted</HI> from the Presence of GOD! His <HI>Servants</HI> we are to whom we obey, led <HI>Captive</HI> by him at his Will; the miserable <HI>Prey</HI> of the <HI>Lion</HI> or <HI>Dragon</HI> of Hell; the forlorn <HI>Spoil</HI> of the Powers of Darkness! What a <HI>Shame</HI> and Reproach is this to <HI>Human</HI> Nature! To <HI>Men</HI> made but little lower than the <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> and for <HI>Angelic</HI> Perfection and Felicity among them!—but how are we fallen by Sin, into the Hands of <HI>Devils,</HI> into the <HI>Mire</HI> of their Prison, in <HI>Chains</HI> under Darkness!—Here is Bondage and Slavery abject∣ly <HI>chosen,</HI> and continued in! as if Sinners could <HI>love their Masters, and would not go free;</HI> altho' the SON OF GOD has come down from Heaven; and even <HI>died,</HI> as well as <HI>besought</HI> them, to make them <HI>free.</HI></P>
<P>It is true that <HI>no Man</HI> can be truly said to <HI>love the De∣vil;</HI> and the more Sinners come to <HI>know</HI> of him the more they must <HI>hate</HI> him; and <HI>mutual</HI> everlasting <HI>Ha∣tred</HI> between them and Devils in <HI>Hell</HI> will be one Part of their eternal <HI>Torment:</HI> But Multitudes love his Lusts,
<PB N="53" REF="005366_0051_101825E913EAFBD8"/>and wear his inglorious <HI>Chains</HI> with Mirth and Pleasure; yea some count 'em their <HI>Ornaments,</HI> like true <HI>Hotten∣tots</HI> in the visible Kingdom of GOD. The <HI>Devil</HI> is wor∣shipped and serv'd in the <HI>dark Places</HI> of the Earth out of gross Ignorance and <HI>Fear;</HI> but by Multitudes under the Light of the Gospel from <HI>liking</HI> to his Motions, in all the <HI>Filthinesses</HI> both of <HI>Flesh and Spirit:</HI> A practical Love they show to their deadly <HI>Enemy,</HI> and they hate their <HI>Friend,</HI> their <HI>Father,</HI> their <HI>Redeemer, the Holy One of GOD!</HI>—It would be a good <HI>Step</HI> in Religion to <HI>hate</HI> the Devil! how few of the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Men</HI> do it in Truth, whatever they may think! It is the Property of <HI>Grace,</HI> and no small Part of our Christian <HI>Bond</HI> by our <HI>Baptism,</HI> to renounce the <HI>Devil</HI> and all his Works; yea to hate his <HI>Likeness</HI> in our selves or others; to <HI>mourn</HI> and bewail it in <HI>our selves,</HI> and behold it in <HI>Trans∣gressors</HI> and be <HI>grieved.</HI> The Act of Renunciation and <HI>Ab∣juration</HI> in our <HI>Baptism</HI> should be remember'd by us, <HI>re∣peated</HI> and confirmed every Day we live: This is our <HI>Alle∣giance</HI> and Fidelity to GOD our KING, and this is the <HI>Liberty of the Sons of GOD,</HI> the <HI>glorious Liberty</HI> which we are called into by the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Moreover, we must infer</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Devil's</HI> great <HI>Guilt</HI> and the Greatness of his <HI>Damnation</HI> at the last, from his being the <HI>Seducer of Men</HI> into Sin, <HI>Apostacy</HI> from GOD and <HI>Rebellion</HI> against Him; and from his <HI>persisting</HI> in his Attempts against the <HI>Chil∣dren of GOD</HI> unto this Day, with <HI>like</HI> Enmity, Falshood and Malice, as he tempted <HI>Adam</HI> the <HI>Son of GOD</HI> in Pa∣radise.—As he there <HI>belied</HI> GOD and beguiled <HI>Eve,</HI> so he belies GOD still, and would terrify penitent and be∣lieving Souls into unjust and <HI>hard</HI> Thoughts of Him; even the most <HI>vile</HI> and accursed that can be; in Defi∣ance of all that he hath <HI>said</HI> to us in his <HI>Word.</HI> It is his Hatred of GOD, more than of us, that accounts for all this. His <HI>Envy</HI> is of GOD's Glory, his <HI>Malice</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Work of GOD!</HI> This gives the <HI>Glare of Hell</HI> in them. Indeed the <HI>Blood of Souls</HI> alone is a <HI>Scarlet and Crimson die,</HI> but the deeper <HI>Stain</HI> is the <HI>lying against the</HI> HOLY GHOST, whose <HI>Holiness</HI> he hates, declares <HI>War</HI>

The <HI>Dragon fights</HI> though he knows that he can never <HI>con∣quer,</HI> and that the <HI>Time of his Torment</HI> is coming on! he blasphemes GOD, deceives the <HI>Nations,</HI> accuses the <HI>Brethren,</HI> persecutes the <HI>Woman and her Seed,</HI> the <HI>Church;</HI> and casts out his <HI>Floods to drown</HI> her spiritual <HI>Seed;</HI> and all because they <HI>keep</HI> the Commandments of GOD and the <HI>Testimony of</HI> JESUS! But his <HI>Judgment</HI> is coming on and the <HI>Serpent's Head</HI> will be then utterly <HI>crush'd:</HI> even at the <HI>second</HI> Appearing of the SON OF MAN with Power and great Glory; when the <HI>Devil and his Angels</HI> shall be judged by the LORD and his <HI>Saints;</HI> who will destroy him by the <HI>Breath</HI> of his Mouth and by the <HI>Brightness</HI> of his Coming. But previous also to this <HI>final</HI> Judg∣ment, will the <HI>Angel of</HI> JESUS come down with <HI>the Key of the bottomless Pit and a great Chain in his Hand, and lay hold on the Dragon, the Devil and Satan, and bind him and shut him up for a thousand Years.</HI> Rev. xx. 1, 2.

<P>Surely it must <HI>needs</HI> be thus: The <HI>Arch-Sinner</HI> and <HI>first</HI> in Revolt from GOD, and the <HI>inveterate</HI> Enemy, shall least of all <HI>escape</HI> the Divine Vengeance: The <HI>Saints shall judge Angels: They</HI> shall see their <HI>Adversary</HI> and Tempter brought forth in Chains before the <HI>Bar</HI> of CHRIST, around whose Throne they shall stand; they shall hear him arraigned, convicted and <HI>damned</HI> from the Mouth of the glorious MAN, JESUS CHRIST; for his <HI>first</HI> malicious Seduction of our <HI>first Parents,</HI> and for all his Endeavours <HI>since</HI> to maintain and increase our <HI>Apostacy!</HI>

<P>Let me <HI>illustrate</HI> the Matter a little from the Wicked∣ness and tragic End of <HI>Haman,</HI> and the Salvation, Joy and Gladness thence arising to the <HI>Jews:</HI> That vile en∣ormous <HI>Power, Haman,</HI> in his <HI>Luciferian</HI> Pride, Envy and Rage, murderously plotted, and almost compassed, the Destruction of the <HI>captiv'd Church:</HI> The good Queen <HI>Esther</HI> petition'd in her Fear and Anguish for <HI>her Life</HI> and the Life of her <HI>People;</HI> for alas! they were <HI>sold in</HI> the Intention of the <HI>Evil One,</HI> to be destroy'd, <HI>to be slain and to perish!</HI> But in the End, confounded with Guilt and speechless, <HI>Haman</HI> is doom'd and dragg'd to the <HI>Gallows,</HI> which he had prepar'd for <HI>Mordecai the Jew,</HI> after he had just liv'd to see him <HI>exalted,</HI> crowned and triumphing! his <HI>Associates</HI> in the plotted Destruction fell with him under a dreadful Vengeance; and thence was the <HI>Church's</HI> Salvation and Triumph perfected! <HI>Esther reign'd, Mordecai</HI> went out from the Presence of the <HI>King</HI> in <HI>royal Apparel,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> had Light and Gladness Joy, and Honour.—So when the <HI>Grand Enemy of the Saints</HI> is bro't to the <HI>Bar of</HI> CHRIST, in the Judgment of the <HI>great Day,</HI> they will rise up and say—"<HI>This</HI> LORD <HI>is the Adver∣sary and wicked One!</HI> And then the abject <HI>Devil</HI> would most gladly <HI>fall</HI> at the <HI>least Saint's Foot</HI> to beg for his Life!

<P>This is the <HI>second</HI> Inference, — there is a <HI>Devil;</HI> a <HI>Host</HI> of accursed Spirits, of a most cursed Disposition, under hideous Guilts, and reserved to a dreadful Dam∣nation.

Consider the <HI>End</HI> of their Faith and Patience, lest you be <HI>weary</HI> and faint in your Minds.—Let me only <HI>read</HI> to you the <HI>Vision</HI> of these <HI>Victors</HI> above, that have <HI>put off the Har∣ness,</HI> and <HI>rest from their Labours:</HI> Revel. vii. 9, — 17. <HI>After this I beheld, and lo, a great Multitude, which no Man could number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands; and cried with a loud Voice, saying, Salvation to our GOD which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the Angels stood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and the four Beasts, and fell before the Throne on their Faces, and worshipped GOD, saying, Amen: Blessing, and Glory, and Wisdom, and Thanksgiving, and Honour, and Power, and Might be unto our GOD for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the Elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white Robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great Tribulation, and have washed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the Throne of
<PB N="67" REF="005366_0065_101826129A7F2848"/>GOD, and serve him Day and Night in his Temple: and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living Fountains of Waters: and GOD shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Let the <HI>second Use</HI> be of <HI>Caution</HI> in two or three <HI>Particulars,</HI> wherein we may else do Wrong to the <HI>Doc∣trine</HI> before us and misimprove it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us beware of <HI>imputing to the Devil</HI> too much of <HI>our own Sin and Guilt,</HI> the corrupt Workings of our own Hearts. We have <HI>Sin dwelling in us,</HI> and must remem∣ber how we are admonished by the HOLY GHOST, that <HI>every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lust and enticed.</HI> James. i. 14. The <HI>regenerate</HI> have the Re∣mains and Lusting of Sin within them; and in its <HI>Pre∣valence</HI> at times the <HI>Apostle</HI> charges it on indwelling Sin; Rom. vii. 17, 20. <HI>It is Sin which dwelleth in me.</HI> We must by no means say, that the <HI>Agency of the Devil</HI> is in every <HI>Temptation</HI> which Men suffer, or <HI>Sin</HI> which they com∣mit: Neither can we say, that his Hand <HI>is not</HI> in this or that Sin: He is invisible, and our own wicked Hearts act so in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with him, that sometimes which is most to blame is not to be said. It is <HI>best</HI> for the <HI>Sinner,</HI> often to take it wholly to <HI>himself,</HI> but too <HI>common</HI> to hear him laying it to the <HI>Devil. Satan</HI> moved <HI>David</HI> to num∣ber the People, and <HI>Satan</HI> filled the Heart of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> to lie unto the HOLY GHOST. — Only where the <HI>Injection is involuntary,</HI> without and against a Person's Will; where it is <HI>violent</HI> unnatural, a horror and torment to a Person, there it may be reasonably attributed to the <HI>Devil,</HI> his Malice and Force. But ordinarily it is wise and best to <HI>charge our selves,</HI> humble abase and loathe our selves before GOD. Yet it may be utterly <HI>wrong</HI> to accuse, <HI>condemn,</HI> torment our selves, where we are only annoy∣ed
<PB N="68" REF="005366_0066_10182615B6B14FF0"/><HI>assaulted</HI> and tempted, without our <HI>yeilding</HI> to the detested Motion. — In <HI>Temptations</HI> to Sin, that are at∣tended with <HI>Profit and Pleasure</HI> our own Hearts may in all likelyhood be the <HI>principal,</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> only accessary: Or if he is <HI>first</HI> in the Motion and there be our Compli∣ance, we are <HI>accessary</HI> in the Crime, and must smite upon our own Breast. Yet the <HI>Case</HI> too often is, that <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>leud</HI> People tempt the Devil to tempt them; or are so habituated to and set upon their wicked Ways, that they need no <HI>Tempter</HI> besides themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Extream</HI> we should be caution'd against is, of making <HI>too light</HI> of this Doctrine of the <HI>Annoyances</HI> which gracious Souls sometimes meet with from diabo∣lical and hellish Suggestions of <HI>Satan.</HI> It is, I am sensible, a <HI>ridiculous</HI> kind of Suggestion against the <HI>Devil,</HI> in the Opinion of <HI>many</HI> at this Day. Many a <HI>Free-thinker</HI> may be ready to <HI>scoff</HI> at it as fanatical, whimsical, splenetic, <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and what not. Some <HI>virtuous</HI> Persons may be <HI>too far</HI> in such a Tho't; because they have never <HI>felt</HI> any thing of it <HI>themselves,</HI> and thro' the Favour of GOD it is not the <HI>known</HI> Case of very many, and generally those few by <HI>Constitution</HI> of Body subject to Melan∣cholly. — Others it may be, of the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, may d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubt and scruple much the Reality of this Truth, from the <HI>Peace and Quiet</HI> which thro' the Goodness of GOD they have always themselves enjoyed, since GOD has <HI>wro't</HI> upon their Souls, and given 'em <HI>Comfort</HI> in his Ways; and they have found a holy <HI>Fear</HI> and Rever∣ence of GOD increasing with their <HI>Pleasure</HI> in Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Yet I can assure both the <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> (whether they profanely <HI>ridicule,</HI> or whether they <HI>meekly</HI> and ten∣derly <HI>pity</HI> our Doctrine) it is an <HI>undoubted Fact,</HI> what many have <HI>felt</HI> and others <HI>seen,</HI> and there is no <HI>denying</HI> against Sense and Sight. It is a <HI>real Case,</HI> that many very pious Persons are grievously buffeted, vexed and tormented by some <HI>invisible wicked Power,</HI> with base, o∣dious, profane, impure <HI>Thoughts,</HI> which their Souls ab∣hor. — In like manner, People may doubt or deny (if they please) whether ever there was an <HI>Apparition</HI> or a
<PB N="69" REF="005366_0067_10182619359B09A8"/>
<HI>Possession,</HI> because they themselves were never so un∣happy as to see the one or the other; or because there have been <HI>Fancies, Lies</HI> and <HI>Cheats</HI> obtruded on the World in one Case or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther; but to <HI>me</HI> however, it were the Height of <HI>Scepticism</HI> and unreasonable doutb∣ing. — And so it is to make all that has been said con∣cerning <HI>Hellish Annoyances</HI> to be the Fruit of a <HI>distem∣pered Brain,</HI> the Power of Melancholly, or Fitts of <HI>Va∣pour.</HI> — There is a <HI>Medium</HI> we shall do well to keep, that we may not be <HI>superstitious;</HI> but we must quarrel both with <HI>Scripture, Experience</HI> and <HI>humane Testimony,</HI> if we question the Reality of this <HI>Fact;</HI> that <HI>good People</HI> and of good <HI>Understanding</HI> do at times <HI>suffer,</HI> as we have been saying, from a cruel <HI>Tempter</HI> that is blasphemous and <HI>invisible.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A third <HI>Caution</HI> which I would put in is, that we <HI>do not allow our selves to question the Justice and Righte∣ousness of the Divine Permission;</HI> or to entertain <HI>hard Tho'ts of the blessed</HI> GOD on this Account. — Alas! we are no <HI>Judges</HI> of what the Sovereign GOD may do or can do; or of the <HI>Rights</HI> and Wisdom of his Government: We have not yet been in the <HI>Worlds of Spirits,</HI> to see their various Natures, States, Orders and Services in the <HI>Creation of</HI> GOD. But this we know both by <HI>Revela∣tion</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> that Man has <HI>sold</HI> himself to Sin, and that he did it by the Instigation of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and what wonder than is it, that the Devil has so much <HI>Access</HI> to and Influence on him; either to <HI>gain</HI> his Mind and Will to what is <HI>evil,</HI> or if that is <HI>refused</HI> then to <HI>insult</HI> and terrify him.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> gave up himself to the <HI>Tempter</HI> on his first As∣sault, on his plain giving the <HI>Lye</HI> to GOD and charg∣ing him even with an <HI>Envy</HI> of his Creatures Im∣provement in Knowledge and Happiness; and is it any <HI>strange Punishment</HI> of this his shameful and disloyal <HI>Sur∣render</HI> of himself to the <HI>Devil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Will, that it should be so much from that Day in the Power of the Tempter to vex and distress him with new Temptations, or fiery <HI>Injections</HI> on his resisting and refusing them? or might
<PB N="70" REF="005366_0068_1018261CB4840BC8"/>he not by a just <HI>Rejection</HI> from GOD have been given over to the <HI>Possession of Satan,</HI> as his <HI>Tormentor</HI> for ever, for his base Rejection of GOD, his easy Commandment and terrible Threatning of <HI>Death?</HI> — Moreover, from Generation to Generation the <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> of Men do in effect acknowledge, <HI>confirm</HI> and establish, by their own <HI>Act and Deed,</HI> the Dominion and Tyranny of the <HI>Devil</HI> over themselves and their Children, by their <HI>un∣godly Lives</HI> and Conversations; abandoning themselves and their <HI>Offspring</HI> to all manner of Wickedness. And after all, dare they <HI>impeach</HI> the Goodness and Justice of GOD in <HI>permitting</HI> him the <HI>Power,</HI> which they have <HI>themselves given</HI> him, of Access to their <HI>Minds</HI> and Con∣sciences, either as a Tempter or a Tormentor? Is it strange that the <HI>Devil</HI> should call himself the <HI>God of this World,</HI> and say of the Kingdoms and Families of it, "<HI>All this is mine!</HI> when such Multitudes are <HI>led Captive by him at his Will</HI> in the Places of most <HI>pure Faith and Wor∣ship;</HI> and <HI>willingly deceiv'd</HI> by him into eternal Perditi∣on? Or is it wonderful that among the small Number of those that are <HI>saved</HI> from him, as to his <HI>Rule,</HI> some of them are cruelly handled and <HI>persecuted</HI> by him? Can this give us any Pretence for an arraigning of the Di∣vine <HI>Mercy?</HI> when as it is of the LORD'S <HI>Mercy</HI> that the <HI>very best</HI> have not been utterly <HI>abandon'd to them∣selves,</HI> and given up a <HI>Prey to Satan,</HI> as they are <HI>ready</HI> to acknowledge. — How much more must we all own that the just GOD may <HI>judicially give over</HI> wicked and incorrigible Sinners to <HI>their own Hearts Lusts,</HI> and to the Power of <HI>Satan</HI> to <HI>deceive and harden</HI> them to their final Destruction, as he gave over <HI>Ahab</HI> to the <HI>lying Spirit</HI> and his dismal <HI>End!</HI> or to <HI>torture</HI> them before their Time, and drive them <HI>despairing</HI> and roaring out of the World, as he did by <HI>Judas, Spira</HI> &amp;c! And doubtless he may for as wise gracious and <HI>holy Ends,</HI> relating to his <HI>own</HI> Glory and <HI>our</HI> Salvation, and <HI>Satan's Confusion</HI> and eternal Judgment; <HI>try</HI> and <HI>explore</HI> the Truth and Power of his <HI>Grace</HI> in his <HI>Servants</HI> and Children, by permitting the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil, and the Efforts of his
<PB N="71" REF="005366_0069_1018262053AFBBE0"/><HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Spite</HI> against them. Let us not <HI>dare</HI> there∣fore to have or <HI>favour</HI> any <HI>hard Thoughts</HI> of the blessed GOD, for his permitting the <HI>Enemy</HI> of our Souls and his Glory, to tempt and <HI>distress</HI> us when our Hearts are <HI>most</HI> and <HI>best</HI> in our <HI>Endeavours</HI> after a <HI>holy Walk</HI> before him, and <HI>Communion</HI> with him. In <HI>this Frame</HI> the <HI>Temp∣ter</HI> found holy <HI>Job,</HI> when he shot the <HI>fiery Dart</HI> at him, <HI>"Curse GOD and die.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The last <HI>Caution</HI> I wou'd give is this, That those who have <HI>never</HI> suffer'd after <HI>this kind</HI> do not grow <HI>se∣cure</HI> or <HI>high-minded</HI> thereon; but <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>pray</HI> that they <HI>enter not into Temptation.</HI> It is not because you are <HI>better</HI> than others, that you have been <HI>spared</HI> and they griev∣ously tried and <HI>buffeted:</HI> No, <HI>Job</HI> was the <HI>first Saint</HI> in his Day, and therefore the rather <HI>selected</HI> to be the <HI>Champion,</HI> the <HI>David</HI> to go out against <HI>Goliah</HI> and slay him. You are not <HI>sure</HI> but that it may be your <HI>Turn</HI> to suffer thus, before you die. Security or <HI>Self-Confidence</HI> may expose you to the Trial and <HI>Combat;</HI> as <HI>Satan</HI> de∣sired to have <HI>Peter</HI> to <HI>sift</HI> him, when he heard him <HI>vaunt, "I am ready to go with Thee to Prison and to Death.</HI> CHRIST <HI>pitied</HI> him and <HI>pray'd</HI> for him that his <HI>Faith</HI> might not fail. How <HI>well</HI> is it for us, that we have a SAVIOUR to <HI>fear</HI> and care for us, when we do not <HI>enough</HI> fear for our selves.—The <HI>kind Rule</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> to us is, the kind∣est <HI>Admonition</HI> and Warning imaginable to us; "<HI>Thou standest by Faith, be not high minded, but fear. Satan's</HI> Advantage over <HI>Peter</HI> was from his Self-Assurance: he <HI>foil'd</HI> him, though he could not make his Faith to <HI>fail.</HI> Never therefore <HI>presume. Humility</HI> is the great Security of the Grace of GOD with us, and his <HI>Grace</HI> is our only Preservative. <HI>GOD resisteth the proud, but giveth Grace</HI> and <HI>more</HI> Grace to the <HI>Humble.</HI> We had need be <HI>sober and vigilant,</HI> wakeful and on our Watch, because <HI>our Ad∣versary the Devil goeth about as a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour.</HI> And it is with <HI>Fear and Trembling</HI> that we must be <HI>working out our Salvation,</HI> that so GOD may still <HI>work in us both to will and to do of his good Plea∣sure.</HI> Phil. ii. 13. The <HI>Way of GOD,</HI> his <HI>working</HI> on,
<PB N="72" REF="005366_0070_10182622D760CD60"/>in and with us, is <HI>agreeable to the Nature</HI> (the Under∣standing and Reason, Liberty and Freedom) which he has given us; in <HI>Concurrence</HI> with our <HI>own Endeavours,</HI> and making us <HI>diligent</HI> and careful in them.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>third Use</HI> may be of <HI>Conviction, Awakening</HI> and <HI>Terror</HI> to profane BLASPHEMERS, who make a Sport of <HI>belching</HI> out, at their filthy Lips, those cursed and <HI>di∣abolical Words,</HI> which a <HI>gracious</HI> Heart trembles with <HI>Hor∣ror</HI> at the <HI>Tho't</HI> of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to have <HI>suggested</HI> to him.</P>
<P>How many <HI>such</HI> are there, to be every where met with, thro' the <HI>Christian World,</HI> who feel <HI>no Remorse</HI> in <HI>utter∣ing</HI> the Blasphemies against GOD which any <HI>Devil</HI> from <HI>Hell</HI> can Suggest to them! They set their <HI>Mouth</HI> against the Heavens, and their <HI>Tongue</HI> rages thro' the Earth: they make a <HI>Mock of Sin,</HI> misusing, abusing taking <HI>in vain,</HI> the holy and awful <HI>Name of</HI> GOD most High; in <HI>ludi∣crous Oaths, Curses, Imprecations, atheistical</HI> Talk, ridiculing the holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> vilifying Religion! they <HI>curse</HI> GOD <HI>and look up,</HI> look about 'em and regard no Man, <HI>damn</HI> themselves and others in <HI>Railery</HI> or in <HI>Rage.</HI> These in∣carnate <HI>Devils</HI> turn the Earth into a <HI>Hell</HI> before the Time; and would <HI>rend the Heavens</HI> (one would think) and <HI>tear</HI> the Name and Royalties of GOD in Pieces. In execra∣ble <HI>Speech</HI> they daily <HI>reproach</HI> the Name of their MAKER, his Worship and his Laws, his Threatnings and his Curse; the <HI>Blood</HI> of their SAVIOUR and all his offer'd Grace. Surely these are willing to be tho't the <HI>Sons of Hell</HI> and the Chil∣dren of <HI>Belial,</HI> and whose else can they be! <HI>they declare their Sin as Sodom and glory in their Shame!</HI> they are plainly <HI>possess'd</HI> and acted by the <HI>Devil, and his Lusts they do!</HI> they aloud proclaim themselves his <HI>Vassals,</HI> and the <HI>Ene∣mies</HI> of their GOD, and of all that are <HI>good and holy!</HI> they neither <HI>fear</HI> his great and glorious <HI>Name,</HI> nor <HI>tremble at his Word</HI> and Curse; but despise his <HI>Being,</HI> laugh at his <HI>Wrath,</HI> sport at his <HI>Lightning</HI> and Thunder, and mock at <HI>Damnation!</HI> — They <HI>wait</HI> not for <HI>Satan's</HI> Motion, but would <HI>raise</HI> him by impious Adjurations, and bring him <HI>up</HI> from below! they <HI>open wide</HI> both Heart and Mouth
<PB N="73" REF="005366_0071_101826246457E4E0"/>for him to <HI>enter;</HI> and provoke GOD to <HI>depart</HI> from them wholly; saying to Him, "<HI>We desire not the Know∣ledge of thy Ways!</HI> they belch out the <HI>Flames</HI> of Hell, and <HI>sear</HI> themselves as with a <HI>glowing Iron</HI> from it.</P>
<P>O what a Mark of <HI>Reprobation</HI> do such Men wear, what a <HI>Brand</HI> of Perdition on their Cheek and Lips! their <HI>Mouth is full of Cursing,</HI> their <HI>Ways always grievous,</HI> and the <HI>Judgments</HI> of GOD are <HI>far away</HI> out of their Sight!

<P>But how contrary to this is the <HI>Spot of GOD's Chil∣dren,</HI> the <HI>shining Star</HI> worn on their Breast; to show 'em to be among the <HI>Nobles</HI> of the <HI>Court</HI> of HEAVEN! the same <HI>devilish Tho'ts</HI> which are a <HI>Pleasure</HI> to the wick∣ed, <HI>terrify</HI> and torment the godly! the one <HI>trembles</HI> at that which is the other's <HI>Sport!</HI> It is a Sport to a <HI>Fool</HI> to do Mischief; he throws about <HI>Fire-brands, Arrows and Death,</HI> and says—"<HI>Am I not in jest?</HI>—Let it com∣fort the <HI>One</HI> that GOD has said, "<HI>To this Man will I look that is poor and contrite, trembling at my Word!</HI> And let it terrify the <HI>others</HI> to read the <HI>Vengeance</HI> written, "<HI>Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy GOD in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless.</HI> Ever∣lasting <HI>Blasphemy</HI> shall be the eternal <HI>Punishment</HI> of Blas∣phemers! <HI>They</HI> and <HI>Devils</HI> together shall <HI>gnaw their Tongues for Pain, and blaspheme the GOD of Heaven, and never repent to give him Glory,</HI> Rev. xvi. 11.</P>
<P>If any who have us'd themselves to profane <HI>Swear∣ing, Cursing</HI> and execrable Speech, or who curse <HI>inward∣ly</HI> though they dare not speak out, cast their Eyes upon <HI>these Lines;</HI> let me call upon them in the Name and

<P N="4">IV.

<P>Let such <HI>troubled Souls</HI> consider, that these <HI>Annoyan∣ces</HI> from the <HI>Enemy</HI> and the <HI>Avenger</HI> are much rather a hopeful <HI>Symptom of Grace ruling</HI> in them, than of a <HI>grace∣less State</HI> or the Rule of <HI>Sin:</HI> that they are no Argu∣ment of <HI>weak</HI> Grace, but rather of its <HI>Growth</HI> and Strength: Nor is it any Token that your Soul is <HI>out of Frame,</HI> and that the Exercise of Grace is <HI>suspended,</HI> that it is <HI>not lively</HI> and vigorous; for was not JESUS led up by the SPIRIT into the <HI>Wilderness</HI> of Temptation, immediately after his <HI>Baptism?</HI> and was not <HI>Job</HI> assaulted

<P>Again let it be your Comfort, <HI>O Child of GOD,</HI> under all your Annoyances from <HI>Hell,</HI> which you resist and <HI>de∣test,</HI> that they are only a <HI>Sign</HI> that Satan <HI>hates you,</HI> and it may be <HI>fears</HI> you; and that <HI>you hate him</HI> and shall never be <HI>his.</HI> It will comfort you to think that you are hated <HI>by him,</HI> as <HI>Job</HI> was; he <HI>loves his own,</HI> and we know that he <HI>hated</HI> CHRIST <HI>first,</HI> and hates the holy e∣ver blessed GOD implacably, for evermore.</P>
<P>I add, that it may be a Sign that <HI>Satan fears thee,</HI> and therefore <HI>furiously attacks</HI> thee: he fears (I hope) that he shall <HI>lose</HI> thee, and sees thee at least beginning to <HI>fear GOD,</HI> and in his Fear <HI>turning</HI> earnestly from Sin, <HI>caring</HI> for thy Soul, and seeking after an Interest in CHRIST, and the Mercies of GOD thro' Him: this will <HI>inrage</HI> him to be sure, and if GOD permit him he will doubtless come down in <HI>great Wrath,</HI> as knowing that his Time is <HI>short</HI> if thou art turning to GOD: As the

<P>I say again, to <HI>conflict with Satan</HI> is the <HI>Property</HI> of true <HI>Grace,</HI> and it is the Property of the <HI>Devil</HI> to con∣flict with <HI>that:</HI> who but the <HI>Saints of the</HI> MOST HIGH have ever been the <HI>Objects of his Spite,</HI> the Subjects of his <HI>Persecution!</HI> but <HI>fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer! behold, the Devil shall cast some of you into Prison, that ye may be tried, and you shall have Tribulation ten Days! be thou faithful unto Death and I will give thee the Crown of Life.</HI> Rev. ii. 10.</P>
<P>Yea, though thou be <HI>foil'd by Satan</HI> in some Encoun∣ters, as <HI>Peter</HI> was once and twice, yet you may "<HI>rise</HI> again by <HI>Repentance,</HI> and obtain <HI>Establishment</HI> in Grace by your <HI>Fall,</HI> as he did. And remember, "that GOD <HI>trains up</HI> those whom he <HI>loves</HI> and is preparing for <HI>Glory</HI> by Exercises of <HI>Trial,</HI> Temptation and Suffering. So <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>David</HI> were educated long in the <HI>School</HI> of Affliction, and fitted for their <HI>Princely</HI> State and Glories. — And the <HI>greater</HI> the <HI>Fight of Affliction</HI> be, the grea∣ter is the <HI>Victory,</HI> and the greater the <HI>Triumph.</HI></P>
<P>But you will <HI>say</HI> after all, "I <HI>question</HI> whether I do indeed <HI>resist, reject, abhor</HI> and <HI>spue out</HI> those Evil <HI>Thoughts</HI> as I ought to do, and as a <HI>Child of GOD</HI> certainly <HI>ought</HI> and will do!

V. I come now to the <HI>fifth</HI> and <HI>last Use,</HI> which is of <HI>Counsel and Direction;</HI> what <HI>Rules</HI> to give for <HI>Support</HI> against, and for <HI>Deliverance</HI> from such cursed and de∣vilish <HI>Suggestions</HI> and Annoyances, as we have been treating of.</P>
<P>Now the repeated <HI>Rule</HI> to us is in general <HI>this, Jam.</HI> iv. 7. <HI>Resist the Devil and he shall flee from you:</HI> 1 Pet. v. 9. <HI>Whom resist, stedfast in the Faith.</HI> We must re∣fuse, deny, oppose, repulse, resolutely and stedfastly: And to help us in doing so,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us <HI>get</HI> and ever <HI>preserve</HI> right <HI>Conceptions</HI> of the DIVINE BEING; even those <HI>vast</HI> and <HI>awful</HI> and glo∣rious ones which the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> of GOD supply us with. These let us be <HI>frequently</HI> calling to Mind, so as to <HI>fix</HI> them in our Minds, with great Solemnity. Let us use our selves to <HI>think</HI> often of GOD, and ever <HI>speak</HI> of Him with great Seriousness and Reverence; never <HI>lightly</HI> or vainly. — I do not say that the <HI>Habit</HI> of this <HI>will keep us</HI> from the Temptations of <HI>Satan,</HI> nor make 'em <HI>less tormenting</HI> to us; no, the <HI>Torture</HI> of it is from the <HI>greater Reverence</HI> we have of GOD; but it will <HI>arm and fortify</HI> us against the Temptations, and <HI>strengthen</HI> us to resist them.</P>
<P>For how can I be won't to think of GOD aright, ac∣cording to his Excellent MAJESTY, Holiness, Goodness, Wisdom; his Eternity, Immensity, Sovereign Domi∣nion and Power; his Truth Grace and Mercy; my Creator, Preserver; Saviour, Sanctifier and heavenly Fa∣ther; and yet <HI>bear</HI> to have any Thing mean, base, vile suggested to me of Him; or that any such Thought should rise within me against him! No, the better we know what GOD is, the <HI>more</HI> shall we esteem, admire, venerate, love and joy in Him, and the <HI>less</HI> shall we endure an <HI>unworthy</HI> Thought of Him; but our <HI>Faith</HI> will turn it into an <HI>Occasion</HI> of a more express and raised <HI>Adoration.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That we may <HI>defend</HI> our selves from, or <HI>overcome</HI> such Assaults of the <HI>Evil One,</HI> let us diligently <HI>study the Holy Scriptures, meditate</HI> much in GOD's Law, attentively
<PB N="78" REF="005366_0076_101826341922AD58"/><HI>read</HI> his Word daily, and attend on the <HI>preaching</HI> of it with Reverence, Meekness and Love. This is the <HI>Shield of Faith,</HI> whereby to <HI>quench all the fiery Darts of the wicked One.</HI> Eph. vi. 16. This is the <HI>Helmet of Salvation</HI> and the <HI>Sword of the Spirit.</HI> By this we must <HI>defend</HI> our selves, and <HI>put by</HI> the dangerous <HI>Passes,</HI> the deadly Thrusts of the Enemy; and by this we are to <HI>offend</HI> and <HI>pierce the Tempter,</HI> whom we must <HI>wound</HI> and stab and torture by opposing the <HI>written Word</HI> to his cursed Motions. "<HI>It is written,</HI> said our <HI>Holy</HI> SAVIOUR, and so he has taught us to <HI>shame and put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> can't have the <HI>Face</HI> to say to us, as he did to <HI>Eve, "Yea, has GOD said?</HI> when we open our <HI>Bible</HI> to him, and shew him the written <HI>Text;</HI> written by the <HI>Finger</HI> of GOD himself, concerning <HI>Himself.</HI> At <HI>other</HI> Debate or Argument he may be too <HI>hard</HI> for us, but keep to <HI>this</HI> and there can be no <HI>Reply</HI> or Evasion. Tell the <HI>Tempter</HI> you fear and stand in Awe of the <HI>holy Word,</HI> and by that also <HI>he</HI> shall be judg∣ed! tell him that <HI>he</HI> also knows it to be true <HI>and trem∣bles! Parly not</HI> with him, if he say again, "<HI>Yea, has GOD said?</HI> But <HI>insist</HI> upon it, "<HI>Yes has GOD said,</HI> and thou knowest it. Let us <HI>keep to the Word,</HI> and GOD will keep us from or in the Hour of Temptati∣on. Rev. iii. 10. <HI>Eve</HI> lost her <HI>self</HI> and us, by not a∣biding by what she <HI>knew</HI> GOD had spoken. Instead of insisting on GOD's Authority and Veracity, she went to <HI>reasoning</HI> with the <HI>Serpent:</HI> She should have kept to the <HI>Commandment,</HI> the <HI>Promise</HI> and the <HI>Threatning;</HI> kept the <HI>Terrors</HI> and the <HI>Rewards</HI> of GOD in her Eye;" do this and <HI>live,</HI> but in the Day thou <HI>eatest,</HI> thou shalt <HI>sure∣ly die.</HI> Will the <HI>Tempter</HI> show us the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of this World and all the Glories of 'em; let us show him the Glories of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the Flames of <HI>Hell;</HI> and where is the <HI>Power</HI> of his Temptation? — The <HI>End</HI> of the written and preached <HI>Word</HI> is to instruct direct and warn us, that we <HI>be not ignorant of his Devices,</HI> and that we be <HI>arm'd against the Wiles of the Devil.</HI> "I went into the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> (said the tempted and dejected <HI>Psal∣mist</HI>)
<PB N="79" REF="005366_0077_10182636D8259460"/>and there <HI>understood I the End</HI> of the Wicked, in whose flourishing I was grieved. The <HI>Word</HI> brought him <HI>Light</HI> and Comfort, and scatter'd all his <HI>Clouds.</HI> It is <HI>mighty through GOD to the pulling down Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it self against the Know∣ledge of GOD, revenging</HI> every Attempt against it, <HI>and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of</HI> CHRIST. 2 Cor. x. 5. It is the Means appointed for our <HI>Deliverance from the Power of Darkness,</HI> and of our <HI>Translation into the Kingdom of GOD's dear</HI> SON: The Means of recovering Souls out of the <HI>Snare of the Devil,</HI> when they are in most Danger of being <HI>taken Captive</HI> by him. 2 Tim. ii. 26.</P>
<P N="3">3. PRAYER, sincere, and fervent and continued <HI>Prayer,</HI> is a most necessary, special, excellent and <HI>effectual Means of quenching Satan's fiery Temptations,</HI> and to fix the Soul in a stedfast raised <HI>Reverence of GOD,</HI> and <HI>Trust</HI> in Him. It is a <HI>grand Article</HI> and Part of Prayer, as our LORD has taught us in his most excellent <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Directory,</HI> the LORD'S <HI>Prayer, "lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil;</HI> the Evil <HI>one Satan,</HI> the evil <HI>thing Sin.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Possessions</HI> of old, we read that the <HI>worst kind</HI> of unclean and malicious <HI>Spirits</HI> went out by <HI>Prayer and Fasting.</HI> To be sure then let us not <HI>neglect</HI> this powerful Means, which is always <HI>present</HI> with us; for we are bid to <HI>draw nigh always</HI> with true Hearts, and in the <HI>full Assurance of Faith;</HI> praying always with <HI>all Prayer</HI> (vocal or ejaculatory as Occasion offers; — and <HI>when</HI> does it not offer?)</P>
<P>This <HI>Direction</HI> is not only a matter of <HI>Counsel</HI> to us, but of <HI>Commandment</HI> also, and special <HI>Prescription:</HI> for when the <HI>Apostle</HI> in the Name of CHRIST had been numbring to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> all the <HI>Parts of the Christian Armour,</HI> whereby they must <HI>stand in the evil Day,</HI> he adds upon and unto all THIS; "<HI>praying always</HI> with <HI>all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all Perseverance.</HI> This is both the Saints <HI>Strong Hold,</HI> for Refuge and Retreat from the <HI>Enemy; "I flee unto Thee "to hide me; "Thou art my Hiding Place, and shalt com∣pass

When the <HI>Thorn</HI> pierced most, and <HI>Satan buffetted</HI> the holy <HI>Apostle,</HI> he <HI>besought the Lord thrice;</HI> and received the blessed <HI>Answer, "My Grace shall be sufficient for thee.</HI> He had learned this of our LORD JESUS in the <HI>Garden of Temp∣tations,</HI> that <HI>Hour of the Power of Darkness,</HI> when he went away the <HI>third time,</HI> with increasing <HI>Fervency,</HI> Im∣portunity and Submission; <HI>O my Father, if this Cup may not pass away.</HI> So he encounter'd and vanquish'd the <HI>Powers of Darkness,</HI> and <HI>sanctified</HI> to the Church for ever the Way of <HI>Prayer</HI> for <HI>Victory</HI> over them, and <HI>Deliver∣ance</HI> from them.—When <HI>Peter</HI> also was to be tempted, CHRIST <HI>prayed for him,</HI> and told him that he had done so, that he might <HI>pray for himself.</HI> It ever was and will be the Way of GOD's People. When <HI>Rabshakah blasphem'd,</HI> rav'd and threatned, <HI>Hezekiah lift up his Prayer,</HI> and GOD answer'd, Let the <HI>Daughter of Sion despise</HI> him! <HI>whom has he reproached!</HI>—and when <HI>Haman had devised</HI> against the Church, <HI>Esther and Mordecai</HI> sought the LORD by <HI>Fasting and Prayer,</HI> and then she <HI>fell down in Tears</HI> also before the King.— Do we <HI>feel</HI> or <HI>fear</HI> the Annoyances of the <HI>evil Spirit,</HI> let us <HI>go</HI> in our <HI>Tears</HI> with <HI>Faith</HI> to the <HI>good</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> GOD, for his <HI>Aids,</HI> Succours, Influences, to pre∣vent and keep us; and tho' the <HI>Tempter</HI> should follow you to your <HI>Knees</HI> and even dare to suggest <HI>Blasphemy</HI> to you there; yet let him not <HI>deter</HI> or drive you from <HI>Praying,</HI> but double your <HI>Adorations</HI> of GOD, and say "<HI>At what time I am afraid I will trust in Thee; in GOD will I praise his Word, in the</HI> LORD, <HI>I have put my Trust; I will not fear</HI> what Men or Devils can do unto me.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="6">6. That afflicted <HI>tempted Persons make not too great a Matter of their molesting Thoughts;</HI> which they are very <HI>prone</HI> to do, and they give <HI>Tempter</HI> a great <HI>Advantage</HI> thereby. <HI>Non multum volvat et revolvat Cogitationes istas,</HI> says the very pious, judicious and learned <HI>Van Ma∣stricht:</HI> "Don't keep <HI>poring</HI> on and <HI>revolving</HI> in your Minds the Molestations given you; but humbly <HI>obtest</HI> and <HI>plead</HI> before GOD your utter <HI>Aversion</HI> to them, with <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to GOD for it; and beg of him to enable you not to <HI>lay 'em so to Heart,</HI> as to be <HI>hinder'd by 'em</HI> in Matters of <HI>present Duty,</HI> toward GOD, your selves, your Families or Neighbours.

<P>I remember the <HI>Venerable Mr. Baxter</HI> speaks on this <HI>Argument</HI> in the following Manner, <Q>If you make a great Matter of every <HI>Thought</HI> that is <HI>cast</HI> into your Mind, you keep 'em the <HI>longer</HI> in Mind, and 'tis the Way to <HI>fix</HI> 'em there. Troublesome Thoughts are like angry <HI>Scolds,</HI> who if you regard and <HI>answer</HI> 'em will <HI>follow</HI> and dog you, and never have done; but if you <HI>answer 'em not,</HI> and <HI>turn</HI> from 'em, they'll have <HI>done</HI> and give over; or at least you <HI>get out of hear∣ing 'em.</HI> — The <HI>Devil</HI>'s Design (says he) is to dis∣quiet and <HI>vex</HI> you; let him see that you will not re∣gard him. He'll keep you <HI>to it</HI> all Day long, if he finds you <HI>hearkning</HI> to and <HI>answering</HI> all he says. He will take you off from <HI>greater</HI> Duties and from <HI>all</HI> Duties, if you stay to <HI>wrangle</HI> with him.</Q>— As the <HI>Arch-Angel rail'd not</HI> again at the <HI>raving Devil,</HI> but only said "<HI>the LORD rebuke thee;</HI> so answer and <HI>rebuke</HI> the Injections of <HI>Satan,</HI> and <HI>argue not</HI> with him.—Yea, la∣bour after a <HI>placid Submission</HI> to the Will of GOD in his <HI>holy Permission</HI> of them. Turn the <HI>cruel</HI> Exercise given by an <HI>Enemy,</HI> into a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and Surrender to GOD. This Example <HI>Job</HI> gives in our Text, and so did CHRIST <HI>in the Garden; "Father, let the Cup pass! never the less not as I will.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> seems to have been in this <HI>Frame</HI> under the <HI>Thorn,</HI> and the <HI>Answer</HI> to his Prayer was, "<HI>My Grace shall be sufficient for thee.— Godliness with Contentment is great Gain:</HI> We must labour after <HI>Contentment</HI> in the Will of GOD under the most <HI>fiery Trials:</HI> It is the <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Crown</HI> of all moral <HI>Obedience,</HI> active or passive: It is the <HI>Top-stone</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> the <HI>Ten Commandments:</HI> We had not known <HI>Sin,</HI> nor yet the <HI>Perfection of Grace</HI> in a sincere Obe∣dience, if the <HI>Law had not said,</HI> and ended thus, "<HI>thou shalt not covet.</HI> There is <HI>one Will in Heaven,</HI> which is GOD's, and thence is the Perfection of <HI>Holiness</HI> and
<PB N="85" REF="005366_0083_10182647C5650AE0"/><HI>Happiness.</HI> If it could be <HI>thus</HI> on Earth, we should be <HI>perfect</HI> too here below. That we may be so, as far as is <HI>possible, Contentment</HI> in the whole <HI>Will</HI> of GOD is the <HI>last</HI> Commandment. This would <HI>fulfil</HI> the whole Law, in both the <HI>Tables</HI> of it; in all the <HI>Devotion</HI> we owe to GOD, in all the <HI>Love</HI> we owe to <HI>our Neighbour,</HI> and in all the <HI>Care</HI> we should have of our <HI>own Souls.</HI> And to <HI>exhibit,</HI> evidence and promote this <HI>blessed Frame</HI> in us under the most <HI>fiery Trials,</HI> let me proceed to ano∣ther <HI>Rule</HI> or Direction, which is</P>
<P N="7">7. Make Conscience of <HI>daily</HI> exercising your selves in <HI>Adoration, Blessing, Thanksgiving</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI> to GOD; more especially for CHRIST and the <HI>sure Mercies</HI> of the Everlasting <HI>Covenant</HI> of Grace, purchas'd and ratified by his <HI>Blood. In GOD I will praise his Word, in the LORD I have put my Trust, I will not fear what Flesh</HI> (or <HI>Spi∣rit) can do unto me;</HI> when they <HI>would swallow me up!</HI> or <HI>while fighting daily they oppress me.</HI> Psalm lvi. 1, 4. This is to <HI>fly to the Rock of</HI> Salvation, and <HI>hasten our Escape from the windy Storm and Tempest.</HI> For the <HI>Name of the LORD is a strong Tower, which the righteous fly to and are safe;</HI> and the Promises in CHRIST are the <HI>Anchor</HI> of our Souls in every <HI>Storm</HI> of Temptation.</P>
<P>"Tie your selves daily therefore (says Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>) to spend as much Time in confessing <HI>Mercies receiv'd,</HI> as in confessing <HI>Sins committed.</HI> Be more in the <HI>Praises of GOD,</HI> and less in <HI>bewailing your selves. Thanksgiving</HI> is the <HI>greater</HI> Duty; give <HI>this</HI> the largest Share of your Time:— As Change of <HI>Diet</HI> will change the Tempe∣rature of the <HI>Body,</HI> so you may <HI>sweeten</HI> your embitter'd Minds by <HI>delightful</HI> Thoughts of GOD. Praise Him for his <HI>Mercy</HI> and his <HI>Truth,</HI> when the <HI>Tempter</HI> would have you <HI>question</HI> or deny both. You will find your <HI>Graces</HI> move, and <HI>Comforts</HI> flow by this Means; as when you go into <HI>Sun-shine</HI> you find Light and Warmth. — Or if you can't find at last that you have the <HI>de∣lighting Love</HI> which you desire, you may not be able to deny but you have a <HI>desiring</HI> seeking and <HI>lamenting</HI> Love. Thank GOD for <HI>this,</HI> and take Encouragement from
<PB N="86" REF="005366_0084_1018264C22FDAC10"/>it, and it will increase both Love and Comfort.— But after all, as <HI>he</HI> goes on to <HI>advise</HI> and direct</P>
<P N="8">8. "<HI>Overvalue not the passionate Part of Duty,</HI> nor build too much on <HI>Transports of Joy</HI> as the surest <HI>Evi∣dences</HI> of true Grace, or necessary to a <HI>Walk</HI> before GOD and <HI>Communion</HI> with Him; but know that a re∣solved humble <HI>Choice</HI> and Endeavour are the <HI>Life</HI> of Grace and Duty; when <HI>Feelings</HI> are but <HI>lower</HI> and un∣certain Things. — This is another of the <HI>Rules</HI> gi∣ven by the heavenly and experienced Mr. <HI>Baxter.</HI></P>
<P>"You know not what you do, says he, when you lay so much on the <HI>passionate</HI> Part, and are striving for deep and <HI>transporting</HI> Apprehensions: These are not the <HI>main</HI> and great Things, nor the <HI>Essentials of Holiness.</HI> Too much of this <HI>Feeling</HI> may distract you: and GOD knows best how <HI>much</HI> of it may be <HI>good</HI> for you, or what you may be <HI>able</HI> to bear.—Passionate <HI>Feelings</HI> (says he) depend much on <HI>Nature;</HI> some People are much more <HI>sensible</HI> than others; a <HI>little</HI> Thing goes <HI>deep</HI> with 'em. The most <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>solid</HI> are usually the <HI>least</HI> passionate, and the <HI>weakest</HI> hardly moderate their Passions. GOD is not an Object of <HI>Sense,</HI> but of the <HI>Understanding</HI> and Will. I have known many <HI>complain</HI> for Want of deeper <HI>Feelings,</HI> when if they had been <HI>more,</HI> it might have <HI>distracted</HI> them." Thus <HI>He.</HI></P>
<P>Some <HI>good Souls</HI> have been ready to wish they could feel <HI>greater Degrees of Terror,</HI> such as they have <HI>seen others</HI> in, or <HI>heard</HI> 'em tell of their passing thro': but this does not seem to be a <HI>natural</HI> Exercise of Grace, whether we consider GOD or our <HI>Selves:</HI> For, the <HI>Pains</HI> of every <HI>Birth</HI> belong to GOD alone to <HI>order,</HI> and not at all to <HI>us to chuse:</HI> And as we are very thankful to GOD when a <HI>Child</HI> is born with <HI>fewer</HI> and more <HI>gentle</HI> Pains to the Mother; so by all means ought the <HI>Soul</HI> to be that passes thro' the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> by the Will of GOD, with lesser <HI>Agonies</HI> of Distress: for <HI>Instance,</HI> — tho' the <HI>Jailor</HI> could never enough be thankful to GOD, that he <HI>broke open</HI> his hard Heart, like the <HI>Iron Gate of the Pri∣son,</HI> by the Terrors of an <HI>Earthquake;</HI> — yet ought not
<PB N="87" REF="005366_0085_1018264EC3FDF130"/><HI>Lydia</HI> to be as much <HI>rais'd</HI> in Gratitude to the same <HI>So∣vereign Grace?</HI> and was she not as much <HI>affected</HI> (think you) with the Kindness and <HI>Gentleness of</HI> GOD in his dealing with her in a more <HI>mild</HI> and <HI>placid</HI> manner? Acts xvi. 14. "<HI>Whose Heart the</HI> LORD <HI>opened, that she attend∣ed to the things spoken by Paul; and when she was baptised and her Houshold, she besought us saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my House and abide there: and she constrained us.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Look to thy holy, <HI>humble, constant, even,</HI> and if pos∣sible <HI>chearful Obedience to the Laws of the Gospel;</HI> that thou <HI>be righteous before</HI> GOD, <HI>walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the</HI> LORD, <HI>blameless.</HI> <Q>O That my <HI>Ways were directed</HI> (as <HI>David</HI> teaches us to pray) that <HI>I might keep thy Precepts!</HI> then shall I not be <HI>ashamed,</HI> when I have <HI>Respect</HI> unto <HI>all</HI> thy Commandments! I <HI>will</HI> keep thy Statutes, <HI>forsake</HI> me not utterly" — <HI>Walk before me,</HI> said GOD to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and be thou <HI>perfect;</HI></Q> and lo I <HI>establish my Covenant</HI> with thee; —"The LORD <HI>is with you</HI> while ye be <HI>with Him;</HI> and if you <HI>seek</HI> him he will be <HI>found</HI> of you; but if you <HI>for∣sake</HI> him he will forsake you. Look diligently to thy <HI>holy living,</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> shall never <HI>hurt</HI> you. "<HI>Eschew Evil,</HI> and GOD will make his <HI>Hedge</HI> about you. "Who shall <HI>harm</HI> you if you be <HI>Followers</HI> of that which is <HI>good.</HI> <Q>GOD is faithful who will not <HI>suffer</HI> you to be <HI>tempted</HI> above what you are <HI>able,</HI> but will with the Tempta∣tion find a way to <HI>escape.</HI></Q>—<HI>Satan</HI> will be discouraged if he sees he can't <HI>hinder</HI> thee in <HI>holy living,</HI> but only <HI>quickens</HI> thee in thy Care and <HI>Heed</HI> thereto. This is to turn the <HI>Devil's Weapons</HI> against him, and to <HI>stab him</HI> with his <HI>own Sword.</HI> The righteous shall <HI>hold on</HI> his Way; GOD will not suffer his Feet to be <HI>moved,</HI> and he that hath <HI>clean Hands</HI> shall wax <HI>stronger and stronger.</HI>— Answer therefore and rebuke the <HI>Tempter,</HI> strong in <HI>Faith; "depart</HI> from me, thou <HI>evil One,</HI> for <HI>I will</HI> keep the Commandments of my GOD! "LORD I will keep thy Statutes, O <HI>forsake</HI> me not utterly! — That Temptation is lost on us that does not cause us to <HI>trans∣gress;</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="005366_0086_1018265052D77898"/>but if it increase our <HI>Watch</HI> unto Prayer and Obedi∣ence it is our <HI>Gain.</HI> "He that committeth <HI>Sin</HI> is of the <HI>Devil,</HI> but in this the <HI>Children of</HI> GOD <HI>are manifest;</HI> <Q>how shall <HI>I do this Wickedness</HI> and sin against GOD! Ye are then of GOD, <HI>little Children</HI> and have <HI>over∣come!</HI> for <HI>greater is</HI> HE <HI>that is in you, than he that is in the World.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="10">10. After all, and in all, <HI>build</HI> nothing upon thy <HI>own Righteousness,</HI> nor <HI>act</HI> or <HI>trust</HI> in thy own <HI>Strength;</HI> but seek to and rely on CHRIST for Righteousness and Strength; and cast thy <HI>polluted, guilty,</HI> perishing, <HI>wound∣ed</HI> Soul on the <HI>free Sovereign Grace,</HI> Mercy and Com∣passion of GOD, imploring the everblessed ETERNAL SPIRIT, the <HI>Convincer</HI> of Sin, the <HI>Sanctifier</HI> of Souls, and then their COMFORTER, to be ever <HI>with thee;</HI> to <HI>succour</HI> and support thee, to defend and <HI>keep</HI> thee, to <HI>rebuke the Tempter,</HI> to <HI>bruise</HI> him under thy staggering Feet; and <HI>say</HI> unto thee, "<HI>My Grace is sufficient for thee,</HI> and <HI>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI>—Thus go in the Name of CHRIST to the Everlasting FATHER for the Gift of his HOLY SPIRIT, to shew thee the <HI>Evil of Sin,</HI> to work in thee a <HI>saving Humiliation</HI> for it, to give thee a true and <HI>deep Repentance,</HI> Contrition and <HI>Self-loathing</HI> on the Account of it, to <HI>enable thee to cry</HI> for Pardon and Re∣novation; to be <HI>in thee</HI> the <HI>Spirit of Grace and Supplica∣tion,</HI> to help thee with <HI>Groanings</HI> which cannot be utter∣ed, and succour thee when tempted; to work <HI>Faith</HI> in thee and the proper <HI>Exercise</HI> of it upon every Occasion, in <HI>every Time of Need;</HI> to make it work by <HI>Love,</HI> to make thee know the <HI>Love of</HI> CHRIST which passes Know∣ledge; to <HI>ground and root</HI> it in thee; to give thee and encrease in thee <HI>a Child-like Fear</HI> and Reverence, and a <HI>Christ-like Submission</HI> to his and thy <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> his GOD and thine; a Covenant GOD and FATHER in Him. —And then to be thy COMFORTER; for it is his blessed <HI>Office,</HI> under and from the <HI>Ascended</HI> SAVIOUR; who was <HI>tempted,</HI> and that hideously, both in the <HI>Wilderness</HI> and in the <HI>Garden;</HI> and in <HI>our stead,</HI> bearing the Sins of <HI>his Elect,</HI> and is therefore able to <HI>succour them that be tempted.</HI>

<P>AN excellent LETTER on the foregoing <HI>Subject</HI> com∣ing lately into my Hand, I have prevail'd with the <HI>Person</HI> to whom it was wrote, to yield to my publishing a Part of it, as I now do, without asking Leave of the Revd. and judicious <HI>Writer</HI> of it,—for I truly think it will make up some <HI>Defects,</HI> and also give Strength and <HI>Force</HI> to some Things said, in this <HI>Treatise.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>July</HI> 19. 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think your <HI>Difficulties</HI> are not <HI>peculiar</HI> to you, but such as I have met with <HI>frequent</HI> Instances of; tho' Persons under such like Difficulties are ready to think them peculiar, and that <HI>no One's Case</HI> is like their's.—It is evident that <HI>Satan</HI>'s Design is to <HI>hinder</HI> their serving GOD, and using the pro∣per Means for their own Profit and Comfort; by wasting away their Time and Lives in unprofitable Exercises of Mind, needless Doubts, Scruples, Terrors, and fighting with Shadows; and it soon thro' Melancholly becomes <HI>natural</HI> for them to <HI>pore</HI> upon that which is unprofitable▪ and thereby they feed their own <HI>Disease,</HI> and <HI>involve</HI> themselves more and more, till they get an <HI>Aversion</HI> to, and <HI>object</HI> most against, those <HI>Things</HI> which have the great∣est Tendency to their <HI>Relief:</HI> There is a certain <HI>Gloom</HI> up∣on the Mind which the <HI>Devil</HI> makes great Advantage of; for it weakens the Mind and disables it from guarding a∣gainst him; to his utmost therefore he strives to <HI>increase</HI> that Gloom; (for he sees that the <HI>Mind</HI> while under it is like <HI>a City without Walls</HI>) and to that End will ever now and then be casting in some <HI>horrid Tho't,</HI> or fright∣ful Suggestion, or Temptation: And if the Person in such
<PB N="92" REF="005366_0090_1018265FAE501FF8"/>a Case goes to <HI>dispute</HI> with him, or <HI>fight</HI> against him, he often makes his <HI>Advantage</HI> of that very disputing and fighting; and by that Means <HI>plunges</HI> the Soul deep∣er and deeper, and entangles it more and more. The best Way of <HI>resisting</HI> the subtle and strong Adversary is to <HI>neglect</HI> him, turn <HI>from</HI> him, and not <HI>enter</HI> into Disputes with him; nor take so much <HI>Notice</HI> of his Suggestions, however frightful and horrid, as to be <HI>alarm'd</HI> with them: For if he has once alarm'd and <HI>affrighted</HI> the Soul, then he has gain'd a great <HI>Advantage</HI> against it, and he will be sure to <HI>improve</HI> it to his utmost.—The best Way is for a Person to <HI>look unto GOD</HI> for Help, and <HI>go right on his Way,</HI> and not <HI>stand to hear</HI> what the Devil has to say. This above any other Course <HI>disappoints</HI> him, for hereby he <HI>loses his Opportunity</HI> to try his Strength and <HI>Subtilty</HI> with us; for he knows well that if he can <HI>draw</HI> into a Dispute with him he shall be too <HI>subtil</HI> for us: A <HI>Resolu∣tion</HI> to go stedfastly right forward in the Way of <HI>Duty</HI> and of <HI>all</HI> Duty, (if one could maintain it) without stand∣ing <HI>still,</HI> or turning <HI>aside,</HI> is one of the best <HI>Remedies</HI> un∣der such sort of Difficulties.—The great <HI>Strife</HI> of the Devil is to weaken and <HI>break</HI> such Persons <HI>Resolution</HI> and Stedfast∣ness in the Way of Duty, and either by <HI>Terror</HI> or <HI>Perswa∣sion</HI> to make 'em <HI>neglect some Ordinance,</HI> or some Duty of our <HI>general</HI> or particular <HI>Calling;</HI> some Duty of <HI>Worship,</HI> or some necessary <HI>worldly Business;</HI> or something that Providence <HI>calls</HI> us to, by which we might <HI>profit</HI> our Selves, our <HI>Families,</HI> our <HI>Neighbours</HI> or the public <HI>Societies</HI> unto which we belong. And I have observ'd that Per∣sons under such Circumstances, being in <HI>Darkness</HI> and Doubts of the <HI>State</HI> of their Souls, <HI>generally take a wrong Course</HI> to obtain Satisfaction: they spend all their Time almost <HI>in anxious poring on past Experiences,</HI> and <HI>viewing 'em over and over:</HI> Not but that they <HI>ought to examine</HI> past Experience; but this is not <HI>all,</HI> nor yet the <HI>main</HI> Thing they have to do: Deliverance from Doubts and Darkness, in such <HI>Cases,</HI> is not obtain'd chiefly <HI>by Self-Examination,</HI> but <HI>Action</HI> I have always observ'd that when Persons instead of <HI>applying</HI> themselves with all their
<PB N="93" REF="005366_0091_101826615C6E8C98"/>Might to <HI>seek GOD</HI> and his Grace, and to <HI>serve him, for∣getting the Things that are behind,</HI> and <HI>pressing forward</HI> in the Way of all Duty, as tho' they <HI>counted not themselves to have apprehended;</HI> I say, when instead of <HI>this,</HI> they <HI>neg∣lect their great Work,</HI> and <HI>abandon themselves to musing, po∣ring and looking over Things that are past;</HI> they get <HI>nothing</HI> by it: A spending <HI>seven Years</HI> in thus examining <HI>past</HI> Ex∣periences or <HI>present</HI> Circumstances, brings 'em <HI>no nearer</HI> to Satisfaction; but rather <HI>intangles</HI> and <HI>perplexes</HI> their Minds more and more, and gives <HI>Satan</HI> greater Advan∣tage: And however with their examining themselves they do as they <HI>think</HI> strive to <HI>go on</HI> in a Way of <HI>Duty,</HI> yet in their <HI>seeking GOD</HI> they commonly err in <HI>four</HI> Things:</P>
<P N="1">1. They seek him with an <HI>unsubmissive Spirit.</HI> It is true they sometimes seek <HI>earnestly</HI> and with <HI>Bitterness of Soul;</HI> but there is commonly <HI>a Sort of Uneasiness,</HI> and in∣ward <HI>Tumultuousness,</HI> and <HI>Unquietness</HI> of Spirit; which shows a <HI>Want</HI> of that <HI>humble, meek, calm</HI> and submissive Spirit, that becomes a poor <HI>unworthy Worm,</HI> and more es∣pecially a <HI>Christian,</HI> or a <HI>Child of GOD,</HI> when GOD <HI>frowns</HI> or <HI>hides his Face.</HI> I have often seen <HI>this;</HI> they have some Degree of that <HI>Frame</HI> which <HI>Job</HI> had before <HI>Elihu</HI> spake, and GOD after him out of the <HI>Whirlwind;</HI> they <HI>complain</HI> "that they <HI>cry to GOD</HI> and he does <HI>not answer,</HI> they <HI>seek</HI> him but they cannot <HI>find</HI> him; "<HI>they go for∣ward, but he is not there; and backward but they can't per∣ceive him!</HI> He seems to <HI>shut out their Prayer, and turn a deaf Ear</HI> to them. But I have known many <HI>Instances</HI> of such as made these <HI>Complaints,</HI> being brought afterwards by the Grace of GOD to seek him after quite <HI>another</HI> Manner; to lie as it were at his <HI>Foot,</HI> in a humble sub∣missive <HI>quiet</HI> Frame of Spirit, in a great Sense of their utter <HI>Unworthiness,</HI> and of GOD's Holiness and <HI>Sovereign∣ty,</HI> and so remaining in a calm <HI>waiting</HI> Frame; when once they have been brought to <HI>this,</HI> all their <HI>Clouds</HI> have been <HI>scatter'd,</HI> and GOD has wonderfully appeared and <HI>unveil'd</HI> himself for their <HI>Consolation:</HI> and I never knew it <HI>fail,</HI> when Persons after great <HI>Darkness,</HI> and having

<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Error</HI> in such Persons <HI>seeking GOD,</HI> is seek∣ing with <HI>Discouragement. Before they ask</HI> they do as it were <HI>conclude</HI> they shall have a <HI>Denial;</HI> and <HI>while</HI> they are asking, they do as it were <HI>tell GOD</HI> that he <HI>won't an∣swer 'em;</HI> and so they greatly <HI>dishonour</HI> him, deny him the <HI>Glory</HI> of his Grace, and provoke a Denial. They ask in a <HI>heartless</HI> Manner, because in a <HI>discourag'd</HI> Man∣ner. Hence they have no <HI>Resolution</HI> to say as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, "<HI>I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</HI> When they <HI>ask</HI> and are <HI>denied,</HI> it has not that <HI>Effect</HI> upon them, as it had upon the <HI>Woman of Canaan,</HI> to make her <HI>cry the more earnestly,</HI> and to be the more <HI>resolute.</HI> On the <HI>con∣trary,</HI> they are <HI>knock'd on the Head,</HI> and are ready to conclude, that GOD <HI>don't intend</HI> to show 'em Mercy, and that <HI>his Mercy is clean gone for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another <HI>Error</HI> in their seeking is, that they <HI>seek Comfort more than Holiness.</HI> We ought to seek <HI>Comfort,</HI> and the Joy of the <HI>Light of GOD's Countenance,</HI> as of more <HI>Worth</HI> than all the World; but our Minds should be more <HI>engaged,</HI> and our <HI>Strength</HI> more imploy'd, in an earnest <HI>Care</HI> and Strife to do our <HI>Duty to</HI> GOD, and to <HI>serve</HI> him; than to <HI>attain</HI> the Comfort of <HI>Satisfaction a∣bout our own Condition:</HI> It should be our <HI>Meat and Drink to do the Will of GOD:</HI> If we take effectual Care of <HI>this,</HI> GOD will take Care of our <HI>Comfort,</HI> and will do that for us, which <HI>we</HI> can never do for our Selves: He'll scatter our <HI>Clouds</HI> and Darkness, and fill our Souls with <HI>Light.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another <HI>Error</HI> in such Persons <HI>seeking GOD</HI> is, that they do not seek him in the Way of <HI>all Duty.</HI> It may be they abound in <HI>praying,</HI> and <HI>reading,</HI> and <HI>meditating,</HI> and <HI>fasting;</HI> and <HI>lie upon their Faces</HI> as <HI>Joshua</HI> did, when <HI>smitten before A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> but they are not so thorough in the
<PB N="95" REF="005366_0093_10182665286BC358"/>mean Time <HI>to search out the Achan;</HI> the <HI>Trespass</HI> in every Way of the <HI>Commandments</HI> of GOD. For GOD is to be sought and <HI>waited on</HI> in the Way of the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>every Thing</HI> that he calls us to, whether they be the <HI>Du∣ties</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>second Table:</HI> the immediate Duties of <HI>Religion,</HI> or of <HI>secular Business:</HI> These are <HI>all</HI> of 'em <HI>Wisdom's Gates</HI> and the <HI>Posts of her Doors,</HI> where we are to <HI>watch</HI> and <HI>wait.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Sir, I have briefly express'd my <HI>Thoughts</HI> with Regard unto the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of that Nature which you labour under. <HI>Experience</HI> abundantly convinces me of my <HI>Insufficiency</HI> to relieve in such Cases. It is GOD that must help to <HI>give good Advice,</HI> and also to <HI>follow</HI> it. It is the <HI>good Shepherd</HI> must <HI>seek his Sheep:</HI> To His Al∣sufficient <HI>Power</HI> and Grace I recommend your <HI>Case,</HI> and am</P>
