<HEAD>A VINDICATION of NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Poor <HI>New-England:</HI></P>
<P>THOU hast always been the eye∣sore of Squinting malignity; the <HI>Butt</HI> of many Envenomed Arrows, which from time to time have been Shot at thy Tranquillity; but of none more wickedly Designed, than those late <HI>Addresses,</HI> which have (after their fashion) Endeavoured to alienate Their <HI>Majesties</HI> Affections from thee. However let it be known, Thou hast friends in <HI>England</HI> who Suffici∣ently know thy circumstances, to wipe off the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> now cast upon thee; And give thee a better and more faithfull Carracter.</P>
<P>What sincere <HI>Protestant</HI> in the three Kingdoms can behold (without Regret) the Inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes, and hard measures, which that <HI>Protestant Country</HI> hath of late met with all from their <HI>Tory</HI> Adversaries? A <HI>Protestant Country,</HI> 'tis, (we say) and of the <HI>Church of England</HI> too, (whatever is bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ered to the Contrary) in that they acknowledge the Doctrinal <HI>Articles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> here professed, and that with a greater sincerity, than many who have subscribed these Articles (for prefer∣men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s) and after preached up and pub∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagiar, Armini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and <HI>Soci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (not without a spice of <HI>Popery</HI>) which are to them the most palpable Con∣tradictions.</P>
<P>The things wherein that <HI>Country Dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s</HI> from that which is Commonly called the <HI>Church of England,</HI> is their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and form of <HI>Church Government;</HI> while in the same time they Agree therein, not only with the <HI>Nonconformists</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> but with <HI>all</HI> the rest of the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> in <HI>Christendom:</HI> Let the matter be throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly scan'd, and you will find very little Dif∣ference between the <HI>Scotch, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches, and the Church of <HI>New-England:</HI> Perhaps nothing but this, that the Church of <HI>New-England</HI> chooses to do that more <HI>Explicitely,</HI> which is done <HI>Im∣plicitely</HI> in all those other Churches; And if the Pastors and Elders of the Churches there have been a little more willing, to manage their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/>,</HI> than it is in some other Churches, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think they have enough to say for it, to Excuse them from the Imputation of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Here then the Difference be∣tween <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> is wholly swallowed up in that Country; and any one, having a Certificate of his Communi∣on in any of those <HI>Forreign Churches</HI> men∣tioned, is admitted into the like Commu∣nion there, without any further Difficulty.</P>
<P>The <HI>first Planters</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> could not indeed comply, with several things, Imposed in the Church of <HI>England</HI> for that they thought them <HI>unwarrantable,</HI> and the Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yance therein, Unto <HI>them (Dis∣satis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>) Sinful.</HI> The imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers tho they <HI>confessed</HI> the things <HI>Indifferent,</HI> yet (so Rigid were they, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves even to destroy the Non-complyers.

<P>'Tis impossible to Relate all the Hard∣ships and sorrows, which they underwent in subduing that horrid Wilderness: But the good providence of GOD to smiled upon them, that in a little time that Wil∣derness was by their great Endeavours &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, improved into an habitable Country: And by the after Natives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (who knew no other) accounted too pleasant a Land to be parted with upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accounts: And altho' in the last 50 years, more have gone out of it, than ever went into it, Yet hath New-England encrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d (by the blessing of God) to a people of (perhaps many more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) 100000 Souls.</P>
<P>The Settlement and prosperity of that Country hath not a little contributed to the <HI>Revenues,</HI> of the <HI>English Crown;</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is from there chiefly the West Indian plantations, have their <HI>Provisions, Timber∣trade, Horses &amp;c.</HI> so that in all things whereby they do advantage the Crown, they must acknowledge they are beholding to <HI>New-England</HI> for it, without which they had hardly been capable of <HI>Subsistence,</HI> or indeed of <HI>Settlement.</HI> The N-Englanders pay <HI>Customs</HI> in the Southern plantations for all they fetch from thence into their own Country: And when they bring them hether, they pay the same over again. Be∣sides the vast <HI>Returns</HI> they otherwise make into <HI>England,</HI> i. e. <HI>Plate, Oyl, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>try, Fishery &amp;c.</HI> Their <HI>Shipping</HI> has also been Considerable, for which they are (or may be with Encou∣ragement) so well furnished with All Ma∣terials, that the King may (if He please, &amp; as Occasion Requires) there build whole <HI>Naci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> as well as thence fetch a few <HI>Mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and that at very easy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as is Judged by men that understand those Affaires.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these advantages, they have been no <HI>wayes Chargeable to the Crown of England,</HI> where they quietly enjoyed their Charters; what it has cost the King force their disturbance, the Exche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or Officers can best inform you. <HI>Indians</HI> have more than once made Bloudy Wars upon them, but (by Gods help) they have with much Bravery and Gallantry, repressed and sub∣dued the Salvages, tho' met without con∣siderable Expence, yet they never put a farthing to the Kings Account tho' it were to maintain the Extent of his Dominion. This is far beyond what any other such English plantations can pretend unto.</P>
<P>Add to this.</P>
<P>They have Erected a Considerable <HI>Colledge</HI> amongst them for the Education of their Youth in Piety and good Literature; Tho' they have had no Royal <HI>founders</HI> (no <HI>Al∣freds</HI> no <HI>Balliols,</HI> no <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urys</HI> 6<HI>th</HI> or 8<HI>ths,</HI> no Queen <HI>Elea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors &amp;c.</HI>) no great pre∣lates (Such as <HI>Chichley, Fox, Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lif, Wool∣sey &amp;c▪</HI>) to promote so glorious a Work; No Extraordinary <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nefactors</HI> (Tho' they are not ungratefull to the Memo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of such as have freely Contributed to so great and Useful a Charge) A <HI>Colledge</HI> that has sent forth Able and Faithful Pastors, to more than 100, Christian Congregations, in that Country, besides the help they have afforded to some other parts of the World. A <HI>Colledge</HI> that has been supplyed with
<PB N="3" REF="000452_0004_0FA5B27318EF83B0"/>
Students from <HI>free</HI> Schooles ordered to be se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led in Every Considerable Town of the Collonies. A <HI>Colledge</HI> that has <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> In∣dians,</HI> to make them serviceable to their own Country men; which Pagans, tho' they have often molested, and some times sorely Distressed, the honest New-Englanders, yet their Charity has so far Extended towards them, as to endeavour their Welfare both Temporal and Eternal.</P>
<P>On all this the <HI>Colledge</HI> by Ingenuous &amp; Civil Education hath had its proper In∣fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence. The <HI>Colledge</HI> which we say was a <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Necessary</HI> Work, and therefore deserves all Encouragement and Promo∣tion. <HI>Noble;</HI> for where is the Like in all the English America? where, even among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that in wealth do far Exceed the poor Lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ous New-Englanders, is there any such thing? And <HI>Necessary</HI> too; for else the Rising Generations would have soon become Barbarous; because neither would their Estates reach to seek Education in <HI>England;</HI> neither would any person of worth go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from hence (unless driven by Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion) so far of to seek Employment when he might have it nearer home. 'Twas therefore a brave and happy thought that first pitched upon this <HI>Colledge;</HI> Tho' at some times it has been unhappy in this, that it has bestowed its favours (is A Ms.) on some ungrateful persons, who would now undermine that Government upon which its foundations were laid; and by which for so long a time its superstructure has been always sustained.</P>
<P>The <HI>Loyalty</HI> of that people to the Crown of England, and its Legal Government is sound, whatever to the Contrary has been Asserted or Insinuated; not only <HI>Interest</HI> obliges them, but <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> dis∣poses to a Readiness, in testifying their <HI>Al∣legiance</HI> to their King upon all occasions; some late Instances may manifest it to be <HI>Signal;</HI> But we shall first hear what their accusers say, and then convince them and the whole World, that the Adversaries of New-England have the least cause to B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and Vaunt themselves in this matter; as will appear in its place.</P>
<P>Upon Consideration of the foregoing particulars, we may well say, that man had Reason, who formerly in Print pub∣lished an account of that Country, to con∣clude his Discourse with this passage.</P>
<P><HI>One would think such a People should not find an Enemy among any sort of Christia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, but those called</HI> Papist, <HI>or else among such as</HI> Papist like, <HI>can give up their Religion, Rights, Liberties and properties</HI> nay, <HI>their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> senses, to the Conduct of their fellow Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>But it cannot be Imagined, that the Enemy of all good, should not always be inspiring some or other to be molesters of such a people, and to endeavour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reproach and Ruin: they have been a People too like the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> to be any other wise used in the World, than those Ancient Confessors of our Sa∣viours time. Hence they have not only been frequently Troubled by the <HI>Townyes</HI> among whom they dwell, but have also been continually <HI>Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kened</HI> by the Calum∣nies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of some that dwell among themselves, who have been willing to serve the <HI>Ac∣cuser of the Brethren:</HI> But God has payd them their Wages: for it has been of∣ten observed that the Remarkable Judg∣ments of Heaven have first or last over∣taken the Adversaries of that People; tho' God hath for a while Fatherly Chastised them, by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Rods, which he hath af∣terwards consumed.

<P>This people must be still Disturbed, Yea, <HI>Exterminated;</HI> Do they not see it?

Why, only send some French Dragoons a∣mongst them to <HI>Teach them Succoths Lesson</HI> by the <HI>Briars and Thornes of the Wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Well, God with a miracle of Mercy, has by the late <HI>Revelution,</HI> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed them from some of those Dangers: And yet there are a company of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></HI> amongst them, that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to get them back into what they have Escaped; And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> are the <HI>Refuge</HI> unto which therein they have had their Recourse.</P>
<P>There scarce ever went a Civil stranger into those parts, but he hath Admired &amp; Predicated the Charity, Civility, and Hospita∣lity of that People; yet some III-minded men, who went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther <HI>Poor</HI> Enough, and after grew <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> amon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them, have been so Abominably ungrateful as to Revile that Country with Clam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs and Slanders, Purposely to procure them all manner of Oppressions.

<P>Now for the pedantick <HI>Narration,</HI> in which see how Wisely they begin with Cele∣brating <HI>the grace and favour</HI> of His Majesties <HI>Royall Predecessor</HI> in the change of <HI>New-Englands</HI> Government about 4. or 5. years since: mean while consider how negli∣gent are all the <HI>Corporations</HI> of England (whereof that of <HI>New-England</HI> was called one) that they have not all this while Re∣presented to His Majesties, the High opini∣on they had of His late Majesties, <HI>Grace and Favour</HI> in depriving <HI>them</HI> of their Charters. <HI>A Grace and Favour,</HI> say yee? we thought His present Majesti's descent into <HI>England</HI> was on purpose to deliver the English Nation from such <HI>favours: A favour?</HI> no 't was a <HI>Treason</HI> against the Crown of England, as designed to destroy the Dominions thereof; and if so, they which carried that Token of love, deserve somthing for their labour. <HI>As</HI> to <HI>New-England</HI> in Particular, it was a <HI>monstrous favour,</HI> to overturn that Govern∣ment, under which the Plantation had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ouri∣shed some scores of years, and not one in Twenty but dreaded an alteration thereof; and in the Room of it, to Establish a Go∣vernment absolutely destructive to the English-mans <HI>Magna Charta</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> a <HI>French-man</HI> with <HI>four more</HI> (none of them chosen by the people) to make <HI>Laws,</HI> leavy Taxes, and send all of them 2 or 3000. miles out of their Country when they pleas∣ed; whether a <HI>Defensive War</HI> should call for any so to be so exposed or no: This was the <HI>Grace and favour,</HI> which they re∣ceived.</P>
<P>The favourable <HI>way of conveying</HI> this memorable <HI>favour,</HI> we suppose the New-Englanders do well Remember. 'T was by a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> issued out against them, and a Declaration requiring those few par∣ticular persons mentioned therein, to make their def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of their own particular change. The <HI>Governour and Company</HI> appointed an Attorney to appear, and answer the <HI>Quo W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ranto</HI> in the Court of the <HI>Kings bench.</HI> But the prosecutors not being able to make any thing of it <HI>there,</HI> a new suite was (<HI>favour∣ably</HI>) commenced, by <HI>Scire Facias</HI> in the high Court of <HI>Chancery:</HI> there, tho' an <HI>Im∣possible time</HI> for their appearance and an∣swer, was assigned, yet Judgment was en∣tred up against them for default in non appearance, and was not all this admira∣ble <HI>grace and favour?</HI> Besides this they can∣not hitherto forget, that altho' King <HI>Charles</HI> (in his Declaration) assured them, that no man there should be Invaded in his <HI>pro∣perty;</HI> yet upon the vacating of their Char∣ter, their new Masters made bold, and did them the <HI>favour</HI> to tell them, that they had now lost all <HI>Titles to their Lands;</HI> they were all the Kings; and accordingly be∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to serve <HI>Writts of Intrusion</HI> upon them. As for those that are fond of <HI>such favours,</HI> let them have their Belly full, and much good may it do them.</P>
<P>Yet all this might had some <HI>favour</HI> in it, if it were (as they say) a <HI>Deliverance from the Slavery and Thrald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of a most Extrava∣gant &amp; Arbitrary Government:</HI> surely if it had been such as they represent it, yet it is not a little unco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th for the favo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the

latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to call it so. And yet let them know (<HI>how Extravagant and Arbitrary</HI> soever it was) few in the Territory were for its dissolution, but such as were for the raising of their own fortunes upon their Neighbours ruines. This Government by Charter containing divers priviledges for encouragement of so great an undertaking, was the product of <HI>King and Council,</HI> on whose wisdom tis no small Reflection to call it <HI>Extravagant.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! but say they; <HI>No part of the Char∣ter, but the name, was ever made use of, or regarded.</HI> A charge which their most Violent accusers had never yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>head enough to alledge against them: why was not this proved, when the <HI>Quo Warranto's</HI> were ser∣ved? Indeed the Administrators of the Government were <HI>men</HI> who had their faults; but all mankind knows, that upon advise, they have been ready to correct their Errou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, when they have seen they did not rightly understand some Particulars in their Charter.</P>
<P>Well; but it seems the Destruction of that Government, has made some <HI>so happy, as to enjoy the freedom of Divine Service and Worship, after the manner of the Church of Eng∣land, which was never untill the Vacating of the said Charter, admitted or allowed to any.</HI> Tis true that the <HI>Common Prayer Worship</HI> was not so publickly used before the late <HI>usur∣pation</HI> and Invasion of their Government. But see the reason. Twas not because the Government <HI>would not allow it</HI> (that's the shameless lie of these <HI>Addressors</HI>) the Go∣vernment never <HI>did,</HI> nor <HI>durst</HI> hinder any persons, from the use of that Service. They many years since repeal'd a Law (made in the days of yore) which seemed to bare a little upon but <HI>one piece</HI> of that Service. They have always had that regard unto the Statutes of England, that they never (as we can learn) gave the least molestation to <HI>that way;</HI> altho' tis well known, that Plantation was Erected, by the first plan∣ters, on purpose to avoid many things there∣in. The truth of the matter is this; There could never be found amongst them, to make a Sufficient Congregation to <HI>that way;</HI> un∣till the change of the Government powered in some strangers who were to raise (to themselves) Estates amongst them. Before <HI>that,</HI> those of <HI>that way</HI> who had any visible sense of Religion, usually joyned in worship with the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> as find∣ing nothing in those Administrations to of∣fend their Conscience: tho' perhaps not enough to please their <HI>Appetite.</HI> Besides if any one appear to be a man fearing God, they receive him to the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> not∣withstanding his being <HI>Episcopal</HI> Or if at any time there were any number of <HI>that way,</HI> they could never find <HI>Clergi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-men</HI> to undertake the cure of their souls. Tis confessed that once, or twice, a Debauch∣ed <HI>Priest</HI> has appeared amongst them; particularly one <HI>Vardenbosch,</HI> who, be∣sides the good work of <HI>Baptizing</HI> a noted Whore, or two of his acquaintance, made private <HI>Marriages,</HI> without any previous publication of <HI>Bauts</HI> (which is a nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance &amp; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to all humane Society) and yet so tender was the Government, as only to give them some <HI>Orall Rebukes,</HI> upon which the guilty Knaves have run away. <HI>Pirates</HI> indeed that will Drink, Sweare, Fornica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, practice and preach up (the honest games of) Cards, Dice &amp;c. Have never found New-England a good Fishing ground. And others that have had more <HI>Grace,</HI> have also (for the most part) had more <HI>Witt,</HI> than to Cross the Ocean, for a dwelling in so <HI>Cold a Country.</HI> And this is all the Inter∣ruption that ever the Church of England found in those parts of the World.</P>
<P>They next affirm, that all this while, <HI>such as were in fellowship, and Church Co∣venant there, and their Children, do not include a Tenth part of His Majesties Subjects in those
<PB N="9" REF="000452_0010_0FA5B27C19D3E870"/>
parts.</HI> Which, if true, we must needs say, 'Tis (as they add) <HI>to the great shame, and Scandal of the Christian Religion.</HI> But where must the <HI>Shame</HI> lye? The Churches there open the Doors for all godly men to come to their Sacraments. Let any person (of whatever perswasion) manifest a real piety, and see if they shall be denied any Eccle∣siastical Priviledges, or Ordinances. In the same Church there, have been <HI>Presbyterians, Independents, Episcopalians, and Antipaedobap∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> all welcome to the same Table of the Lord, when they have manifested to the Judg∣ment of Christian Charity a work of Regene∣ration in their souls. To speak plainly; If the Church of <HI>England</HI> do <HI>Practice</HI> according to what it does <HI>profess,</HI> in the Qualifications, which the Rub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick of its Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgy, requires of all Communicants, it must Exclude <HI>more than Ten</HI> of its members from the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a∣ment, where the Church of <HI>New-England</HI> Excludes <HI>one,</HI> in any of its Congregations. Yea, travel to any English Plantations in America; and see whither <HI>New-England</HI> has not proportionably <HI>Ten times</HI> more Com∣municants, than any of them all. It is well known that <HI>Barbados</HI> and <HI>Virginea</HI> are no Countrys of Non-conformists to the Church of England; will you then know what Mr. <HI>Godwin</HI> (a <HI>Church man</HI> of their own) testifies concerning them? of <HI>Bar∣bados</HI> he writes thus; <HI>A Country in England of the same Extent with this Island, has com∣monly an hundred, or more, Parishes and Mi∣nisters; but in this Island, half of the Churches are destitute, tho' but Eleven in all; and in those Churches that are better supplied. It is known that Prayers and Sermons are usually delivered to little more than the bare walls only; notwithstanding the Multitude of English people belonging to each; of whom not a fifth part could be admitted into most of them should they all appear.</HI> Of <HI>Virginea,</HI> he writes; <HI>It is most certain, that there are many fami∣lies, who have never been present at any pub∣lique Exercise of Religion since their Importa∣tion into that Collony.</HI> These things were published more than <HI>Ten years</HI> since; and it may be soon Enquired, whether the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> (who claimes Jurisdictions over those Countreys) has yet redressed things that are so much <HI>to the great shame, and Scan∣dal of the Christian Religion.</HI> Why the E∣pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>copalians now should represent <HI>New-England,</HI> as odious upon this Account, no <HI>Reason</HI> but <HI>Malice</HI> can be given. However we shall indeed be sorry, if His Majesties Subjects in <HI>New-England</HI> do so much dis∣regard the great King of Heaven; that not a <HI>Tenth part</HI> of them, can, or will make a good Claim unto His Blessed Sacra∣ments; but the Truth is, scarce a <HI>Tenth part,</HI> of what these people say, is true. If they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferr to <HI>Baptism,</HI> we must confess, there was One who had the Impudence to <HI>Preach,</HI> before he was <HI>Baptized,</HI> his Name was <HI>Samuel Myles M A.</HI> but this was none of the Countrys fault; twas because, of his <HI>Descent.</HI> There are <HI>divers times Ten.</HI> Towns in that Country, that have not <HI>half Ten</HI> families (free from a bad fame) in which the Children are not Baptized. If the Assertion of these Reproaches could any where be verified, one would think it should be in <HI>Boston,</HI> (which most abounds with <HI>Strangers,</HI> and consequently with <HI>Vices</HI>) yet if any man should say, <HI>they that are in Church Covenant, and their Children do not make a Tenth part of His Majesties Subjects there;</HI> all the Town would proclaim him a most <HI>notorious Lyar.</HI> It seems there is one <HI>Tenth part</HI> of the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> which these men have no conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment for.

This little Book has only two matters in it, the one of History, and the other of Argument: As for the History, tis either true or false; if true, you know whom it Affects: if false; give me so much as one Instance wherein it is so.

Edmund</HI> had <HI>hired them to Fight against the English,</HI> and for that end had made them a great present; but they would not so do, because the English had never wronged them; however the <HI>Maquas</HI> said, they took the present, as pay for what Service they had done for the English in the former War. These <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qua's</HI> (or <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>awks</HI>) were compelled by <HI>Sir. Edmund</HI> to make peace with the <HI>French at Canada,</HI> which the Indi∣ans themselves afterwards bitterly resented, and all men saw this was but to serve the French Interest to the apparent hazard of, &amp; Ruine to <HI>New-England.</HI> Tis true, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ober people of <HI>New-England,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid very little stress upon <HI>Indian</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>timonies; yet they could not be without Apprehensions, when they saw what <HI>methods</HI> were taken, for consuring of those Testimonies. The new English Armies in the East, who did nothing but Starve, Freez, and perish there, knew most of these things. Now considering such things as these, and receiving the surprizing news of <HI>K James</HI> his being retired into <HI>France;</HI> and that there upon <HI>Sir Edmu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> himself Immediately left the Armie, they presently (many of them) without Order went home to their Friends, and it was <HI>this</HI> that produced the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Revolution</HI> had cast the Govern∣ment into better hands, their first care was to settle the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast,</HI> and procure a peace; but the <HI>Sache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> with whom they Treated, prooving false, and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecuting the War, the Government of the <HI>Massac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>etts</HI> sent the greatest Armies they could possibly raise, so defend the places in those provinces, which were most in danger, which has cost them <HI>many Thousand Pounds,</HI> besides <HI>many persons lives</HI> that are lost.</P>
<P>And yet after all this, for a Company of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-minded people to <HI>Article</HI> against the Government, for Exposing those Provinces to Ruine, when themselves know that the whole Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, upon too manifest grounds, ascribe the <HI>beginning of the War</HI> to some, with whom they have been best acquainted; Is a most wicked and abominable absurdity!

<P>But be it so, that the present heavy

Taxes do cause <HI>Murmurers</HI> to encrease a∣mongst them; tis no more than we see here at home; and yet we still suppose there are more than <HI>Twenty to One</HI> amongst them (whatever they talk of their <HI>Thousands</HI>) who would look upon themselves as much <HI>Injured &amp; Abused,</HI> If they should be depri∣ved of their <HI>Charter Government;</HI> but how∣ever things fall, we hope they are well fur∣nished with patience and submission to un∣dergo greater Tryals.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Murmurers</HI> are not so many as they would bear us in hand; We'l give the Reader some Demonstration by an In∣stance. Tis Reported here, that <HI>Charter-Town</HI> is the most Ill-affected, Distracted, &amp; Divided Town in the Country; If it be so, we are sorry for their degeneracy. Now about the same time this Libell came from <HI>Boston;</HI> there came also an Address, In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cribed, <HI>To the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, the humble Address of sundry Your Majesties Subjects Inhabitants in Charles-Town.</HI> These also have it seems forgotten the <HI>Queens</HI> Majesty. But let that pass on the same Score with the other. This Address is an Accu∣sation of the Country for the <HI>Rashness</HI> and <HI>Inconsiderateness</HI> committed in the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and after some other Scurvy flashes and Reflections, which were we at lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure to deal with, they should have their due: They come at last to petition, That <HI>they might not be Estranged from the laws of Eng∣land:</HI> the meaning of all which is easy to be Interpreted: In short, they like nor <HI>Charter Government,</HI> and let them abound in their own sence. As for the Plantati∣ons haveing some things <HI>diverse</HI> from the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> it is no more than all the other English Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> may have affirmed of them. We could never learn that <HI>New England</HI> varies from any Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that would be proper, or were by the <HI>King</HI> and Parliament intend∣ed, for such a Country. However, this Ad∣dress is Subscribed by <HI>Thomas Graves,</HI> late, Judge of the County Court; <HI>Richard Sprague</HI> late Captain of the Trained band, who appeared at the Head of his Company to Assist in the above mentioned <HI>Revolution</HI> in the day thereof; and Ten more; of which, one was a <HI>Sir. Edmunds</HI> Captain, one is in our Copy Subscribed <HI>Bowers,</HI> without a <HI>Christian name,</HI> and no wonder if he be a <HI>Quaker;</HI> we suppose it is <HI>that</HI> Quakers, who was one of <HI>Sir.

<P>The good people of <HI>New England</HI> want not a kindness for the <HI>Church of England;</HI> tho' they cannot be satisfied with these pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enders thereunto; they Believe there are Thousands in that Communion with
<PB N="25" REF="000452_0026_0FA5B28CA3A818F8"/>
whom they Expect Eternal happiness in the same Heaven. Such Renowned Names, as those of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Tillo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> are as pre∣cious and as Valued amongst the people of <HI>New England,</HI> and there <HI>Books</HI> as much Read, and Lov'd and Liv'd, as with any here at home. All the hurt they wish to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> is, to see it <HI>Reform'd</HI> in some things which the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do account none of 'tis <HI>Beauties;</HI> but these <HI>New England Episcopalians</HI> are utterly a discredit to the whole Body whereof they pretend themselves to be the Members.</P>
<P>We are very well Satisfyed the <HI>present Government of New-England</HI> Intend not to molest these odd people for any of these Extravagant matters; but if <HI>Strangers</HI> may <HI>Advise</HI> the said Government (and why may <HI>we</HI> not, as well as <HI>these</HI> people pre∣sume to <HI>Advise</HI> their King?) we would than Council them to be no ways Dis∣couraged from the Service of Their Ma∣jesties. Certainly if any of the <HI>Tory-mas¦querade Jacobites</HI> (who endeavour to En∣feable them and Weaken the hands) shall cause them to for-bear any thing, that must be done to maintain Govern∣ment, Vertue, Order, and Peace, in that Country; they will not find Their Maje∣sties to Thank them for it. Their Majesties own them for a <HI>Government,</HI> their <HI>Charter</HI> is as much Restored, as any of the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> (Except that of <HI>London</HI>) All the World will wonder at them, if they do not use it, since it is all the Government they have, untill Their Majesties shall please to give them further Orders if any of the other Corporations here in <HI>England</HI> should hear, that the <HI>New Englanders</HI> refused to act upon their (lately Incommoded) Char∣ters, they would Hiss at them, as the <HI>Com∣mon Enemies of the English Nation,</HI> should the Freemen here forbear their <HI>Elections,</HI> or the <HI>Tories</HI> here tell them, they might not go on in all things as they were, they would be the Ridicule of the whole World. For any to declare for the late <HI>Commission Government</HI> (being so directly against the <HI>Native Privi∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dges</HI> of English men) is a sort of <HI>Treason;</HI> and it tends to Alienate the minds of Their Majesties Subjects, from their Subjection to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> It is little less <HI>Treasonable</HI> to say that their Majesties have left that Country <HI>without Government;</HI> for that would be to say (what <HI>New England</HI> ab∣hors) that they might dispose of themselves to any Prince or Potentates in the Earth (by a <HI>Client lary</HI> Subjection) for their own Security; according to that Rule of the <HI>Civil Law</HI> [<HI>Sirvus D fer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as a Domino Liber∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sto</HI>] They have therefore a Government for, and under Their Majesties; and what is it? Unless it be their <HI>Charter</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which Their Majesties do Invite them to Act upon; and Expect they should, as the rest of the Nation do, till they are farther Settled. Let <HI>the People</HI> therefore (if they know, and have sense to perceive, their own Interest) pro∣ceed in their free Elections of honest men, and such as they can trust, to take care of the whole; and the <HI>Magistrates</HI> (so Elect∣ed) act Vigorously according to <HI>Law,</HI> till a full Settlement shall come to them, which we hope will not be long; And we doubt not but the fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur of both God and Their Prince shall be their Encouragement.</P>
<P>In fine, Let the people of that Country all Unite for the Common Safety. The <HI>Re∣volution</HI> once, and <HI>Two Miracles</HI> more since, have kept them from Anno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nces by <HI>French Fleets,</HI> which were coming out against them: They must quickly Expect farther Alarms, and it is now no time for them to Quarrel a∣mongst themselves. <HI>New-England</HI> has divers times been on the borders of Ruine, by those two Vices of <HI>Covetousness</HI> &amp; <HI>Ingratitude;</HI> which are things that agree but ill with their <HI>high Profession.</HI> If any Number amongst them should at this time study to with-hold or

And if they ill re∣qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any of their <HI>Publick Servants,</HI> they may live to confess their <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> as much as ever unthankful <HI>Israel</HI> in distress. But now, <HI>Contention</HI> is the Vice, that most Threa∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns that Country. We wish we knew how to compose any differences that may be a∣mongst them; but we cannot fully inform our selves in all the Occasions of the divers sentiments, that we hear are amongst that people: Only we are Jealous that one <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tilent Principle,</HI> Advanced by <HI>Captain Pal∣mer,</HI> in his late Pamphlet against <HI>New Eng∣land</HI> has been too much Imbibed by some, and granted by others to their Litigious Adver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aryes, and has had some Influence thereupon.</P>
<P>This <HI>Palmer</HI> has, the Impudence &amp; Folly to Assert, that [<HI>The English Plantations</HI> (and New England <HI>in particular</HI>) <HI>are no parts of the Empire of England, but like Wales &amp; Ire∣land, which were Conquered, &amp; belong to the Dominion of the Crown of England, and that therefore he, that wears the Crown, may set up Governments over them, which are Despotick and Absolute, without any regard to</HI> (the English mans) <HI>Magna Charta.

It is upon this principle that <HI>New England</HI> has been Torn in pieces by salvage Op∣press<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs; It is upon this same principle, that they have been Railed at for a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣lion like the Sin of witch craft,</HI> for Dis∣mounting these Rank R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, who Spurr'd them on to their own Destruction. But Certainly the man that Publishes this prin∣ciple never more Intends re Visit the <HI>English Plantations in America,</HI> having thus foolishly and wickedly Exposed himself to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust Indignation of them all; how can they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him otherwise, than as a <HI>Common E∣nemy,</HI> that shall thus openly deny them the precious <HI>English Liberties?</HI> No English men in their Wits will ever Venture their Lives and Estates to Enlarge the Kings Do∣minions abroad, and Enrich the whole Eng∣lish Nation, if their Reward after all must be, to be deprived of their <HI>English Liberties.</HI> And pray, let all the English <HI>American</HI> Plan∣tations now take notice, That the <HI>New∣Englanders</HI> in their late Revolution did but act in a <HI>Quarrel</HI> wherein <HI>they</HI> and, <HI>all</HI> Eng∣lish men had an Interest. Gentlemen, <HI>you</HI> that so much Love to hear <HI>New-England</HI> Reproach'd, it was for <HI>you,</HI> as well as for <HI>themselves,</HI> that the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> acted in their Revolution.</P>
<P>Moreover, Will not the Curse of <HI>St. David,</HI> and <HI>St. Patrick,</HI> fall upon the Head of this man, for making the <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> such a Conquered people, as that the <HI>Welch</HI> (since their Incorporation) have but a preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious claime for their Representa∣tives to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itt in the <HI>English Parliament;</HI> and the <HI>Irish</HI> (or rather the <HI>English</HI> in that Kingdom) are but meet <HI>Slaves &amp; Villains,</HI> for all their <HI>Parliament at Dublin.</HI> As for the the Colonys of <HI>New England</HI> in par∣ticular If they be not Esteemed as <HI>parts of England,</HI> why were <HI>Quo Warr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to's</HI> Is∣sued out against the Government in <HI>Boston</HI> as belonging to <HI>Westminister in Midlesex;</HI> and their Tenures settled in free Soccage as of the Manour of <HI>East Greenwich</HI> (as we think it is mentioned in their Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter.)

<P>We shall Conclude this matter with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>orable passage of that Accomplished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Sir.
