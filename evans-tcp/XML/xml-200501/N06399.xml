<HEAD>A brief ACCOUNT of the Book and it's AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Rev. Author of the following Piece has been removed by Death, before its coming into public View, Custom has made it decent to introduce it with a prefatory Page.</P>
<P>The Copy he brought to the Press sometime the last Year, and a Number of Sheets passed his own Review. But a Variety of Incidents retarded finishing the Work till now.—It is hoped, no material Mistakes of the Printer have escaped Correction, besides what are noticed in the Table of Errata.</P>
<P>They that were acquainted with the Author, or know his just Character, &amp; have any Taste for the serious Theme, will want Nothing to be said in Recommendation of the ensuing Tract, but only that Mr. EDWARDS wrote it.</P>
<P>Several valuable Pieces on this Subject have lately been published, upon the same Side of the Question. But he had no Notice of so much as the very first of them, till he had wholly concluded what he had in View: nor has it been thought, any Thing already printed should supersede this Work of his; being designed on a more extensive Plan; comprising a Variety of Arguments, and Answers to many Objections, that fell not in the Way of the other worthy Writers; and the Whole done with a Care of familiar Method and Language, as well as clear Reasoning, in ge∣neral accommodated very much to common Capacities.</P>
<P>It must be a sensible Pleasure to every Friend of Truth, that so masterly a Hand undertook a Reply to Dr. TAYLOR; notwithstanding the various Answers already given him, both at home and abroad.—And should the said <HI>Dr.</HI> or any other in his behalf, attempt to vindicate his Book, though our Author being dead, this his Work will have the Disadvantage of wanting his Pen to defend it,
<PB N="ii" REF="008118_0004_0F6B573D43ECAB50"/>
yet it is not doubted but other sufficient Hands will be found to engage in the Cause, &amp; support labouring Truth.</P>
<P>As it has been thought unfit, this Posthumous Book should go unattended with a respectful Memorial of the Author, it is hoped, the Reader will candidly accept the following Minutes of his Life and Character; chiefly ex∣tracted from Accounts given of him in the public Prints, upon Occasion of his Decease.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS was the only Son of the late Rev. Mr. TIMOTHY EDWARDS, long a faithful Pastor of a Church in <HI>Winsor,</HI> in Connecticut; who (together with his Wife, our Author's pious Mother) was living, in a very ad∣vanced Age, till a-little before the Death of this his ex∣cellent Son, who had for many Years been his Parents Joy and Crown.</P>
<P>He had his Education in YALE COLLEGE.—At the Age of about Eighteen, commenced Batchelor of Arts, Anno 1720.—Afterwards resided at College for some Time, pursuing his Studies with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laudable Diligence.—Took the Degree of Master, at the usual Time: and for a while served the College in the Station of a Tutor.</P>
<P>He soon entered into the Ministry, and was settled at Northampton, in Massachusetts, as Colleague with his aged Grandfather, the Rev. and famous Mr. SOLOMON STOD∣DARD; with whom, indeed, <HI>as a S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n with the Father, he served in the Gospel,</HI> till Death divided them.—There he continued his Labours for many Years, in high Esteem at home, as well as abroad; till uncomfortable Debates arising about a Right to Sacraments, and after his best At∣tempts finding no rational Prospect of any safe and speedy Issue of them, he at length amicably resign'd his Pastoral Relation, and had an honourable Quietus, Anno 1750.</P>
<P>Soon after this, there being a Vacancy in the Mission at Stockbridge, by the Death of the Rev. and learned Mr. JOHN SERGEANT, the Board of Commissioners at Boston, who act under the Society in London, for propagating the Gospel among the Indians in and about New-England, turned their Eyes to Mr. EDWARDS, for a Supply of that
<PB N="iii" REF="008118_0005_0F6B573E66495C70"/>
Mission. And upon their unanimous Invitation, in Con∣currence with the Call of the Church (consisting of Indians and English) at Stockbridge, he removed thither, and was regularly re-instated in the Pastoral Office.</P>
<P>He continued his Ministry there, until on Occasion of the Death of his worthy Son-in-law, the Rev. and Learned Mr. AARON BURR, who had succeeded the Rev. and Learned Mr▪ JONATHAN DICKINSON (so memorable as an Author) in the Station of President of the College of NEW-JERSEY, he was by the Hon. and Rev. TRUSTEES of that Society chosen to be his Successor. The Com∣missioners at Boston having received a Motion from them for his Translation, did in Deference to the Judgment of so respectable a Body, as well as from an Esteem for Mr. EDWARDS, and a View to his more extensive Usefulness, generously consent to his Removal: and the venerable Council, to whom he finally refer'd himself for Advice on this important Occasion, giving their unanimous Opinion for the Clearness of his Call to the President's Place, he at Length (thô with much Reluctance and Self-diffidence) relinquished his Pastoral Charge and Ministerial Mission at Stockbridge, and removed to Prince-Town in New-Jersey, where NASSAU-HALL stands, lately erected.</P>
<P>But that fatal Distemper, the Small-pox, which has in former Days been so much the Scourge and Terror of AMERICA, breaking out, in or near the College, about that Time, and Inoculation being favoured with great Success, Mr. EDWARDS, upon mature Thought and Consultation, judged it advisable to go into this Method. Accordingly he was inoculated on the 23d of February 1758. And thô his Disease was comparatively light, the Pock of a milder Sort, and few, yet such a Number happened to be seated in his Throat and Mouth, as prevented his receiving the necessary cooling and diluting Draughts; and so, upon the Turn of the Pock, a secondary Fever came on, which pre∣vailed to the putting an END (on March 22d) to the important Life of this good &amp; great Man.—As be lived chearfully re∣signed in all Things to the Will of Heaven, so he died, or
<PB N="iv" REF="008118_0006_0F6B573ED9C09720"/>
rather, as the Scripture emphatically expresses it, in relation to the Saint in Christ Jesus, he <HI>fell asleep,</HI> without the least Appearance of Pain, &amp; with great Calm of Mind. Indeed, when he first perceived the Symptoms upon him to be mortal, he is said to have been a-little perplexed for a while, about the Meaning of this mysterious Conduct of Providence, in calling him out from his beloved Privacy, to a public Scene of Action and Influence; and then so suddenly, just upon his Entrance into it, translating him from thence, in such a Way, by Mortality! However, he quickly got believing and composing Views of the Wisdom and Goodness of God in this surprising Event: and rea∣dily yielded to the sovereign Disposal of Heaven, with the most placid Submission. Amidst the Joy of Faith, he departed this World, to go and see JESUS, whom his Soul loved; to be with him, to behold his Glory, and rejoyce in his Kingdom above.</P>
<P>But he left a bereaved Family (his beloved and amiable Spouse, with Ten desirable Children <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of them, his pious and lovely Daughter, Mrs. BURR, soon followed him: only leaving two agreable Children; for whom there can scarce be a better or greater Wish, than that they may live, and shine in the Image of their excellent Parents and Grand-parents.</NOTE>) and a bereaved young Seminary of Learning, to sit in the Dust, and mourn the unspeakable, yea, in some obvious Respects, irreparable Loss, of a most affectionate, wise and faithful Head! And this, in a Season of general Calamity, and threatning Danger to Church and State. Oh, when a holy God takes away such righteous Persons, such invaluable Jewels, in repeated Instances and in quick Succession, from our guilty Land and Nation, and that in the Beginning of a dark gathering Tempest, big with the Fate of Nations, surely it is an awful Omen, claiming our serious Attention and Regard.—May we not justly lament over this excel∣lent Man, in Language like that of David over his Royal Father, &amp; his Brother JONATHAN; "Oh, the BEAUTY
<PB N="v" REF="008118_0007_0F6B573FED055C30"/>
of Israel is slain"!—Or, as he mourn'd over a brave War∣riour, "Know ye not, that a GREAT Man is fallen this Day in Israel!" Or, 'in the pensive Strains of Elisha, la∣menting after Elijah, that eminent Prophet, and Head of the Schools, as he saw him ascending from Earth to Hea∣ven; "My Father, my Father, the CHARIOTS of Israel, and the HORSE MEN thereof!"</P>
<P>Though, by the preceeding Account of Mr. EDWARDS, the Reader may form a general Idea of his Character; yet doubtless a more particular Description will be expected.</P>
<P>In Person, he was tall of Stature, and of a slender Make.—There was something extreme delicate in his Con∣stitution; which always obliged him to the exactest Ob∣servation of the Rules of Temperance, and every Method of cautious and prudent living. He experienced very sig∣nally the Benefit hereof, as by such Means he was helped to go through incessant Labours, and to bear up under much Study, which, Solomon observes, is a Weariness to the Flesh.—Perhaps, never was a Man more constantly retired from the World; giving himself to Reading, and Contemplation. And a Wonder it was, that his feeble Frame could subsist under such Fatigues, daily repeated and so long continued. Yet upon Occasion of some Re∣mark upon it by a Friend, which was only a few Months before his Death, he told him, "He did not find but he was then as well able to bear the closest Study, as he was 30 Years before; and could go through the Exercises of the Pulpit with as little Weariness or Difficulty."—In his Youth, he appeared healthy, and with a good Degree of Vivacity; but was never robust.—In middle Life, he appeared very much emaciated (I had almost said, mortified) by severe Studies, and intense Applications of Thought.—Hence his Voice was a-little languid, and too low for a large Assembly; though much relieved and advantaged by a proper Emphasis, just Cadence, well-placed Pauses, and great Distinctness in Pronunciation.—He had a piercing Eye, the truest Index of the Mind.—His Aspect and Mein had a Mixture of Severity and Pleasancy. He had a na∣tural
<PB N="vi" REF="008118_0008_0F6B5740438A8E20"/>
Turn for Gravity and Sedateness; ever contem∣plative; and in Conversation usually reserved, but always observant of a genuine Decorum, in his Deportment <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> free from sullen, supercilious and contemptuous Airs, and without any Appearance of Ostentation, Levity, or Va∣nity.—As to Imagination, he had Enough of it for a great and good Man: but the Gaieties of a luxuriant Fancy, so captivating to many, were what he neither affected himself, nor was much delighted with in others.—He had a natural Steadiness of Temper, and Fortitude of Mind; which, being sanctified by the Spirit of God, was ever of vast Advantage to him, to carry him through difficult Services, and support him under trying Afflictions, in the Course of his Life.—Personal Injuries he bore with a becoming Meekness and Patience, and a Disposition to Forgiveness.—The Humility, Modesty, and Serenity of his Behaviour, much endeared him to his Acquaintance; and made him appear amiable in the Eyes of such as had the Privilege of conversing with him.—He was a true and faithful Friend; and shewed much of a disinterested Benevolence to his Neighbour.—The several Relations sustained by him, he adorned with an exemplary Conduct; and was solicitous to fill every Station with its proper Duty.—He kept up an extensive Correspondence, with Ministers and others, in various Parts; and his Let∣ters always contained some significant and valuable Com∣munications.—In his private Walk, as a Christian, he ap∣peared an Example of truly rational, consistent, uniform Religion and Virtue: a shining Instance of the Power and Efficacy of that holy Faith, which he was so firmly at∣tached to, and so strenuous a Defender of. He exhibited much of Spirituality, and a heavenly Bent of Soul. In him one saw the loveliest Appearance,—a rare Assemblage of Christian Graces, united with the richest Gifts, and mu∣tually subserving and recommending one another.</P>
<P>As a Scholar, his intellectual Furniture exceeded what is common, under the Disadvantages we labour of in this remote Corner of the World. He very early discovered
<PB N="vii" REF="008118_0009_0F6B57432722A570"/>
a Genius, above the ordinary Size: which gradually ripened and expanded, by daily Exertment and Application. He was remarkable for the Penetration and Extent of his Understanding, for his Powers of Criticism and accurate Distinction, Quickness of Thought, Solidity of Judgment, and Force of Reasoning; which made him an acute and strong Disputant. By Nature he was formed for a Logician, and a Metaphysician; but by Speculation, Observation, and Converse, greatly improved. He had a good Insight into the whole Circle of liberal Arts and Sciences: possessed a very valuable Stock of Classick Learning, Philosophy, Mathematicks, History, Chrono∣logy, &amp;c. By the Blessing of God on his indefatigable Studiousness, to the last, he was constantly treasuring up useful Knowledge, both human and divine.</P>
<P>Thus he appears uncommonly accomplished for the ar∣duous and momentous Province, to which he was finally called. And had Heaven indulged us with the Continu∣ance of his precious Life, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve Reason to think, he would have graced his new Station, and been a signal Bles∣sing to the College, and therein extensively served his Ge∣neration, according to the Will of God.</P>
<P>After all, it must be owned, Divinity was his Favorite∣Study; and the Ministry, his most delightful Employment. Among the Luminaries of the Church, in these American Regions, he was justly reputed a Star of the first Magni∣tude. Throughly versed in all the Branches of Theology, didactic, polemic, casuistic, experimental, and practical. In Point of divine Knowledge and Skill, had few Equals, and perhaps no Superiour, at least in these foreign Parts. On the maturest Examination of the different Schemes of Principles, obtaining in the World,&amp; on comparing them with the sacred Scriptures, the Oracles of God, &amp; the great Stan∣dard of Truth, he was a Protestant &amp; a Calvinist in Judgment; adhering to the main Articles of the Reformed Religion with an unshaken Firmness, and with a fervent Zeal, but tempered with Charity &amp; Cand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, and governed by Dis∣cretion. He seemed as little as most Men under the Bias
<PB N="viii" REF="008118_0010_0F6B574445D5CE10"/>
of Education, or the Possession of Bigotry.—As to practi∣cal &amp; vital Christianity, no Man appeared to have a better Acquaintance with its Nature &amp; Importance; or to under∣stand true Religion, &amp; feel it's Power, more than he: which made him an excellently fit Guide to inquiring Souls, and qualify'd him to guard them against all false Religion. His internal Sense of the Intercourse between God and Souls, being brought by him to the severe Test of Reason and Revelation, preserved him, both in Sentiment &amp; Conduct, from the least Tincture of Enthusiasm.—The accomplish∣ed Divine enters deep into his Character.</P>
<P>As a Preacher, he was judicious, solid, and instructive. Seldom was he known to bring Controversy into the Pul∣pit; or to handle any Subject in the nicer Modes &amp; Forms of scholastic Dissertation. His Sermons, in general, seemed exceedingly to vary from his controversial Compositions. In his Preaching, usually all was plain, familiar, sententi∣ous, practical; and very distant from any Affectation of appearing the great Man, or displaying his extraor∣dinary Abilities as a Scholar. But still he ever preserved the Character of a skilful and thorough Divine. The common Themes of his Ministry were the most weigh∣ty and profitable; and in special, the great Truths of the Gospel of Christ, on which he himself lived by Faith. His Method in preaching was, first to apply to the Understanding and Judgment, labouring to enlighten and convince them; and then to persuade the Will, engage the Affections, &amp; excite the active Powers of the Soul.—His Language was with Propriety▪ and Purity, but with a noble Negligence; nothing ornamented. Florid Diction was not the Beauty he preferred. His Talents were of a su∣periour Kind. He regarded Thoughts, rather than Words. Precision of Sentiment and Clearness of Expression are the principal Characteristicks of his Pulpit-Stile. Neither quick nor slow of Speech, there was a certain Pathos in his Ut∣terance, and such Skill of Address, as seldom failed to draw the Attention, warm the Hearts, and stimulate the Consci∣ences of the Auditory. He studied to shew himself ap∣proved
<PB N="ix" REF="008118_0011_0F6B57456AF909A0"/>
unto God, a Workman that needed not to be a∣shamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.—And he was one that gave himself to Prayer, as well as to the Ministry of the Word. Agreably it pleased God to put great Honour upon him, by crowning his Labours with surprising Successes, in the Conversion of Sinners, &amp; the Edification of Saints, to the Advancement of the Kingdom and Glory of God our Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS distinguished himself as a Writer, espe∣cially in Controversy, which he was called to on a Variety of Occasions. Here the Superiority of his Genius emi∣nently appeared. He knew to arrange his Ideas in an exact Method: and close Application of Mind, with the uncom∣mon Strength of his intellectual Powers, enabled him in a Manner to exhaust every Subject he took under Conside∣ration. He diligently employed the latter Part of his Life in defending Christianity, both in its doctrinal and practical Views, against the Errors of the Times. Besides his excellent Writings in Behalf of the Power of Godli∣ness, which some Years ago happily prevailed in many Parts of the British <HI>America;</HI> he also made a noble Stand against Enthusiasm &amp; false Religion, when it threat∣ned to spread, by his incomparable Treatise upon religi∣ous Affections. And more lately in Opposition to Pela∣gian, Arminian, and other false Principles, he published a very elaborate Treatise upon the Liberty of the human Will. A Volume, that has procured him the Elogy of eminent Divines abroad. Several Professors of Divinity in the Dutch Universities very lately sent him their Thanks, for the Assistance he had given them in their Inquiry into some controverted Points; having carried his own further than any Author they had ever seen.—And now this Vo∣lume of his, on the great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin, is presented to public View. Which, thô studiously adapted to lower Capacities, yet carries in it the evident Traces of his great Genius, and seems with superiour Force of Argument to have intirely baffled the Oppo∣nent.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="008118_0012_0F6B5745864FD458"/>Besides numerous other fair Manuscripts, he has a Volume on the NATURE of VIRTUE; which he designed should follow the present one into the public Light. It is hoped, that we shall yet see it; and that they who have the Care of his Papers, will consult the common Benefit, by pub∣lishing more of the valuable Remains of this great Man: by which, he being dead, may still speak, for the Instruction of Survivors.</P>
<P>His Writings will perpetuate his Memory, and make his Name blossom in the Dust. And the Blessing of Hea∣ven attending the Perusal of them, will make them effect∣ually conducive to the Glory of God, and the Good of Souls; which will brighten the Author's Crown, and add to his Joy, in the Day of future Retribution.</P>
<P>In fine, the candid Reader will excuse the Imperfecti∣ons in this Sketch of a Character and Account of the de∣ceased Man of God. It is hoped, some good Hand will give us the Memoirs of his LIFE at large, and do greater Justice to his Merits.</P>
<P>Some Lines in Verse, published on Occasion of his Death, deserve a Place here.</P>

<HEAD>The Author's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Discourse is intended, not meerly as an Answer to any <HI>particular Book</HI> written against the Doctrine of <HI>original Sin,</HI> but as a <HI>general Defence</HI> of that great important Doctrine. Nevertheless, I have in this Defence taken Notice of the main Things said against this Doctrine, by such of the more noted Opposers of it, as I have had Opportunity to read; particu∣larly those two late Writers, Dr. TURNBULL, and Dr. TAYLOR of <HI>Norwich;</HI> but especially the lat∣ter, in what he has published in those two Books of his, the first intitled, <HI>The Scripture-Doctrine of Original Sin proposed to free &amp; candid Examination;</HI> The other, his <HI>Key to the Apòstolic Writings,</HI> with <HI>a Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistle to the</HI> Ro∣mans. According to my Observation, no one Book has done so much towards rooting out of these Western Parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> the Princi∣ples and Scheme of Religion maintain'd by our pious and excellent Fore-fathers, the Divines and Christians who first settled this Country, and alie∣nating the Minds of many from what I think are evidently some of the main Doctrines of the Gos∣pel, as that which Dr. TAYLOR has published against the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin.</HI> This Book has now for many Years been spread abroad in the Land, without any <HI>Answer</HI> to it, as an Anti∣dote; and so has gone on to prevail with little Controul. I have indeed heard, that an Answer
<PB N="xii" REF="008118_0014_0F6B57471AAF40C8"/>
to it has been publish'd by Dr. JENNINGS of <HI>London:</HI> but never saw it, nor heard of its being in these <HI>American</HI> Parts: So that, however suffi∣cient it may be, it has been of no Service to that Purpose here. And in as much as about <HI>fifteen</HI> Years (if I mistake not) have elapsed, since Dr. TAYLOR'S Piece has been in the Hands of some, there is manifest Need of some other Antidote, for the sake of such as dwell in this Part of the World. The providing one is what I have at∣tempted in the following Work; wherein I have closely attended to <HI>that Piece,</HI> in all it's Parts, and have endeavoured that no one Thing there said, of any Consequence in this Controversy, should pass unnoticed, or that any Thing which has the Appearance of an Argument, in Opposition to this Doctrine, should be left unanswered. I look on the Doctrine as of <HI>great Importance;</HI> which every Body will doubtless own it is, if it be <HI>true.</HI> For, if the Case be such indeed, that all Mankind are by <HI>Nature</HI> in a State of <HI>total Ruin,</HI> both with res∣pect to the <HI>moral Evil</HI> they are the Subjects of, and the <HI>afflictive Evil</HI> they are exposed to, the one as the Consequence and Punishment of the other, then doubtless the great <HI>Salvation</HI> by CHRIST stands in direct Relation to this <HI>Ruin,</HI> as the Remedy to the Disease; and the whole <HI>Gospel,</HI> or Doctrine of Salvation, must <HI>suppose</HI> it; and all real Belief, or true Notion of that Gospel, must be built upon it. Therefore, as I think the Doctrine is most cer∣tainly both true and important, I hope, my at∣tempting a <HI>Vindication</HI> of it, will be <HI>candidly</HI> inter∣preted; and that what I have done towards it's
<PB N="xiii" REF="008118_0015_0F6B5747C3FDE190"/>
Defence, will be <HI>impartially</HI> considered, by all that will give themselves the Trouble to read the en∣suing Discourse.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I had finished my Defence of the Doct∣rine of Original Sin, and prepared the Copy (as here you have it) for the Press, and had wrote the preceeding Part of this <HI>Preface,</HI> before I had re∣ceived the least Intimation of any Thing written or intended to be written by the Rev. Mr. NILES, in Answer to Dr. TAYLOR.—But having heard, that his Answer is chiefly confined to two Parts of Dr. TAYLOR'S <HI>Scripture-Doctrine,</HI>—without so particularly replying to the <HI>third</HI> Part of that Book, or the large <HI>Supplement;</HI> and it being the Design of the following Discourse to examine every Thing material throughout the <HI>whole</HI> Book, and many Things in that other Book of Dr. <HI>T—r's,</HI> containing his <HI>Key</HI> and Exposition on <HI>Romans;</HI> as also many Things written in Opposition to this Doctrine by some <HI>other</HI> modern Authors; and moreover, my Discourse being not only intended for an <HI>Answer</HI> to Dr. TAYLOR, and other Oppo∣sers of the Doctrine of Original Sin, but (as was observed above) for a <HI>general Defence</HI> of that Doct∣rine; producing the <HI>Evidence</HI> of the Truth of the Doctrine, as well as answering <HI>Objections</HI> made against it:—considering these Things, I say, I hope this Attempt of mine will not be thought needless, nor be altogether useless.

<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>PART I. WHerein are considered some <HI>Evidences</HI> of original Sin from <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Events,</HI> as found by Obser∣vation and Experience: together with Representations and Testimonies of holy Scripture, and the Confession and Assertions of Opposers.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LIST>
<ITEM>CHAP. I. The Evidence of <HI>Original Sin</HI> from what appears in Fact of the <HI>Sinfulness</HI> of Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LIST>
<ITEM>SECT. I. <HI>All</HI> Mankind do constantly, in all Ages, without Fail in any one Instance, <HI>run into that moral Evil,</HI> which is in Effect their own utter and eternal <HI>Perdition,</HI> in a total Pri∣vation of God's Favour, and suffering of his Vengeance and Wrath. <HI>Pag.</HI> 1,—17.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. II. It follows from the Proposition proved in the fore∣going Section, that all Mankind are under the Influence of a <HI>prevailing effectual Tendency in their Nature,</HI> to that Sin and Wickedness, which implies their utter and eternal Ruin. <HI>Pag.</HI> 17,—26.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. III. That <HI>Propensity,</HI> which has been proved to be in the Nature of all Mankind, must be a very <HI>evil, depraved,</HI> and <HI>pernicious</HI> Propensity; making it manifest, that the Soul of Man, as it is by Nature, is in a <HI>corrupt, fallen &amp; ruin'd State:</HI> Which is the other Part of the Consequence, drawn from the Proposition laid down in the first Section. <HI>Pag.</HI> 27,—33.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. IV. The Depravity of Nature appears by a Propensity in all, to sin <HI>immediately,</HI> as soon as they are capable of it, and to sin <HI>continually</HI> and <HI>progressively;</HI> and also by the <HI>Remains</HI> of Sin in the <HI>best</HI> of Men. <HI>Pag.</HI> 33,—3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. V. The Depravity of Nature appears, in that the ge∣neral <HI>Consequence</HI> of the State and Tendency of Man's Nature is <HI>a much greater Degree of</HI> Sin, <HI>than Righteousness;</HI> not only with Respect to Value and Demerit, but likewise Matter and Quantity. <HI>Pag.</HI> 39,—49.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. VI. The Corruption of Man's Nature appears by it's Tendency, in it's present State, to an extreme Degree of <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Stupidity</HI> in Matters of Religion. <HI>Pag.</HI> 49,—62.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. VII. That Man's Nature is corrupt, appears, in that vastly the <HI>greater Part</HI> of Mankind, in all Ages, have been <HI>wicked Men. Pag.</HI> 62,—76.</ITEM>
<PB N="xvi" REF="008118_0018_0F6B574D49972B70"/>
<ITEM>SECT. VIII. The native Depravity of Mankind appears, in that there has been so little <HI>good Effect</HI> of so manifold &amp; great <HI>Means</HI> used to promote Virtue in the World. <HI>Pag.</HI> 76,—100.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. IX. Several <HI>Evasions</HI> of the Arguments for Depravity of Nature, from Trial and Events, considered.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Evasion</HI> I. <HI>Adam's</HI> Nature, and the Nature of the <HI>Angels</HI> that fell, was <HI>not</HI> sinful, yet they <HI>sinned:</HI> and <HI>all</HI> Mankind may, <HI>without</HI> a sinful Nature, sin as well as they. <HI>Pag.</HI> 100,—106.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Evasion</HI> II. Man's own <HI>Free-will</HI> is a Cause <HI>sufficient</HI> to account for the general Wickedness of the World. <HI>Pag.</HI> 106,—108.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Evasion</HI> III. The Corruption of the World, may be owing, not to a depraved Nature, but to <HI>bad Example. Pag.</HI> 108,—115.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Evasion</HI> IV. The general Prevalence of Wickedness may with∣out supposing a corrupt Nature, be accounted for by our <HI>Senses</HI> being <HI>first</HI> in Exercise, and our <HI>animal Passions</HI> getting the Start of Reason. <HI>Pag.</HI> 115,—118.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Evasion</HI> V. Men in this World are in a <HI>State of Trial;</HI> it is therefore fit, that their <HI>Virtue</HI> should be tried by <HI>Opposition,</HI> both from without and from within. <HI>Pag.</HI> 118,—121.</ITEM>

<HEAD>The Evidence of Original Sin from what appears in Fact of the Sinfulness of Mankind.</HEAD>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>All Mankind do constantly in all Ages, without Fail in any one Instance, run into that moral Evil, which is in Effect their own utter and eternal Perdition, in a total Privation of GOD's Favour, and suffer∣ing of his Vengeance and Wrath.</HEAD>
<P>BY <HI>Original Sin,</HI> as the Phrase has been most commonly used by Divines, is meant <HI>the innate sinful Depravity of the Heart.</HI> But yet when <HI>the Doctrine</HI> of original Sin is spoken of, it is vulgarly understood in that Latitude, as to include not only the <HI>Depravity of Nature,</HI> but the <HI>Imputation</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="008118_0022_0F6B57500A1AE618"/>
first Sin; or in other Words, the Liableness or Exposed∣ness of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, in the divine Judgment, to par∣take of the Punishment of that Sin. So far as I know, most of those who have held one of these, have maintain'd the other; and most of those who have opposed one have opposed the other: both are opposed by the Author chiefly attended to in the following Discourse in his Book against original Sin: And it may perhaps appear in our future Consideration of the Subject; that they are closely connected, and that the Arguments which prove the one establish the other, and that these are no more Difficulties attending the allowing of one than the other.</P>
<P>I shall in the first Place consider this Doctrine more especially with regard to the Corruption of Nature: and as we treat of this, the other will naturally come into Con∣sideration, in the Prosecution of the Discourse, as con∣nected with it.</P>
<P>As all moral Qualities, all Principles either of Virtue or Vice lie in the Disposition of the Heart, I shall consi∣der whether we have any Evidence, that the Heart of Man is naturally of a corrupt and evil Disposition. This is strenuously denied by many late Writers, who are Ene∣mies to the Doctrine of original Sin; and particularly by Dr. <HI>Taylor.</HI></P>
<P>The Way we come by the Idea of any such Thing as Disposition or Tendency, is by observing what is constant or general in Event; especially under a great Variety of Circumstances; and above all, when the Effect or Event continues the same thro' great and various Opposition, much and manifold Force and Means used to the contrary not prevailing to hinder the Effect.—I don't know that such a Prevalence of Effects is denied to be an Evidence of prevailing Tendency in Causes and Agents; or that it is expresly denied by the Opposers of the Doctrine of original Sin, that if, in the Course of Events, it univer∣sally or generally proves that Mankind are actually cor∣rupt, this would be an Evidence of a prior corrupt Pro∣pensity in the World of Mankind; whatever may be said
<PB N="3" REF="008118_0023_0F6B5750CA830658"/>
by some, which, if taken with it's plain Consequences, may seem to imply a Denial of this; which may be con∣sidered afterwards.—But by many the Fact is denied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That is, it is denied, that Corruption and moral Evil is commonly prevalent in the World. On the contrary, it is insisted on, that Good pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ponderates, and that Virtue has the Ascendant.</P>
<P>To this Purpose Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> says, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moral P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il▪</HI> P▪ 289, 290.</NOTE> <Q>With regard to the Prevalence of Vice in the World, Men are apt to let their Imagination run out upon all the Robberies, Pyracies, Murders, Perjuries, Frauds, Massacres, Assassi∣nations they have either heard of, or read in History; thence concluding all Mankind to be very Wicked. As if a Court of Justice were a proper Place to make an Estimate of the Morals of Mankind, or an Hospital of the Healthfulness of a Climate. But ought they not to consider, that the Number of honest Citizens and Farmers far surpasses that of all Sorts of Criminals in any State, and that the innocent and kind Actions of even Criminals themselves surpass their Crimes in Num∣bers; that it is the Rarity of Crimes, in Comparison of innocent or good Actions, which engages our Attention to them, and makes them to be recorded in History, while honest, generous domestic Actions are overlooked, only because they are so common? As one great Dan∣ger, or one Month's Sickness shall become a frequently repeated Story during a long Life of Health &amp; Safety.—Let not the Vices of Mankind be multiplied or magni∣fied. Let us make a fair Estimate of human Life, and set over against the shocking, the astonishing Instan∣ces of Barbarity and Wickedness that have been perpe∣trated in any Age, not only the exceeding generous and brave Actions with which History shines, but the pre∣vailing Innocency. Good-Nature, Industry, Felicity and Chearfulness of the greater Part of Mankind at all Times; and we shall not find Reason to cry out, as
<PB N="4" REF="008118_0024_0F6B57518CC04070"/>
Objectors against Providence do on this Occasion, that all Men are vastly corrupt, and that there is hardly any such Thing as Virtue in the World. Upon a fair Com∣putation, the Fact does indeed come out, that very great Villanies have been very uncommon in all Ages, and look'd upon as monstrous; so general is the Sense and Esteem of Virtue.</Q>—It seems to be with a like View that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, <Q>We must not take the Measure of our Health and Enjoyments from a Lazar-House, nor of our Understanding from <HI>Bedlam,</HI> nor of our Morals from a Goal, (P. 353.)</Q></P>
<P>With respect to the Propriety and Pertinence of such a Representation of Things, and its Force as to the Conse∣quence designed, I hope we shall be better able to judge, and in some Measure to determine whether the natural Disposition of the Hearts of Mankind be corrupt or not, when the Things which follow have been considered.</P>
<P>But for the greater Clearness, it may be proper here to premise one Consideration, that is of great Importance in this Controversy, and is very much overlook'd by the Opposers of the Doctrine of original Sin in their disputing against it; which is this—</P>
<P>That is to be look'd upon as the true Tendency of the natural or innate Disposition of Man's Heart, which appears to be it's Tendency when we consider Things as they are in themselves, or in their own Nature, without the <HI>Interposition of divine Grace.</HI> Thus, that State of Man's Nature, that Disposition of the Mind, is to be look'd upon as evil and pernicious, which, as it is in it self, tends to extremely pernicious Consequences. and would certainly end therein, were it not that the free Mercy and Kindness of God interposes to prevent that Issue. It would be very strange if any should argue that there is no evil Tendency in the Case, because the meer Favour and Compassion of the most High may step in and oppose the Tendency, and prevent the sad Effect-tended to. Particularly, if there be any Thing in the Nature of Man, whereby he has an uni∣versal, unfailing Tend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncy to that moral Evil, which ac∣cording
<PB N="5" REF="008118_0025_0F6B575243807C00"/>
to the real Nature and true Demerit of Things, as they are in themselves, implies his utter Ruin, That must be look'd upon as an evil Tendency or Propensity; how∣ever divine Grace may interpose, to save him from deser∣ved Ruin, and to over-rule Things to an Issue contrary to that which they tend to of themselves. Grace is a sove∣reign Thing, exercised according to the good Pleasure of God, bringing Good out of Evil; The Effect of it be∣longs not to the Nature of Things themselves, that other∣wise have an ill Tendency, any more than the Remedy belongs to the Disease; but is something altogether inde∣pendent on it, introduced to oppose the natural Tendency, and reverse the Course of Things. But the Event that Things tend to, according to their own Demerit, and ac∣cording to divine Justice, That is the Event which they tend to in their own Nature; as Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s own Words fully imply (<HI>Pref. to Par. on Rom.</HI> p. 187.) <Q>God a∣lone (says he) can declare whether he will pardon on punish the Ungodliness &amp; Unrighteousness of Mankind, which is in IT'S OWN NATURE punishable.</Q> Nothing is more precisely according to the Truth of Things, than divine Justice: It weighs Things in an even Balance; it views and estimates Things no otherwise than they are truly in their own Nature. Therefore undoubt∣edly that which implies a Tendency to Ruin according to the Estimate of divine <HI>Justice,</HI> does indeed imply such a Tendency in it's <HI>own Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And then it must be remember'd, that it is a <HI>moral De∣pravity</HI> we are speaking of; and therefore when we are considering whether such Depravity don't appear by a Tendency to a bad Effect or Issue, 'tis a <HI>moral Tendency</HI> to such an Issue, that is what is to be taken into the Ac∣count. A moral Tendency or Influence is by <HI>Desert.</HI> Then may it be said, Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature or State is attend∣ed with a pernicious or destructive Tendency, in a <HI>moral</HI> Sense, when it tends to that which <HI>deserves</HI> Misery and Destruction. And therefore it equally shews the moral Depravity of the Nature of Mankind in their present
<PB N="6" REF="008118_0026_0F6B5753575A12B8"/>
State, whether that Nature be universally attended with an effectual Tendency to destructive Vengeance <HI>actually executed,</HI> or to their <HI>deserving</HI> Misery &amp; Ruin, or their <HI>just Exposedness</HI> to Destruction, however that fatal Conse∣quence may be prevented by Grace, or whatever the actual Event be.</P>
<P>One Thing more is to be observed here, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Topic mainly insisted on by the Opposers of the Doctrine of Original Sin, is the Justice of God; both in their Ob∣jections against the Imputation of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, and also against it's being so order'd that Men should come into the World with a corrupt and ruin'd Nature, without having merited the Displeasure of their Creator by any personal Fault. But the latter is not repugnant to God's Justice, if Men can be, and actually are, born into the World with a Tendency to Sin, and to Misery and Ruin for their Sin, which actually will be the Consequence, unless <HI>meer Grace</HI> steps in and prevents it. If this be allowed, the Argument from <HI>Justice</HI> is given up: For it is to suppose that their Liableness to Misery &amp; Ruin comes in a Way of Justice; otherwise there would be no Need of the Inter∣position of divine Grace to save 'em; Justice alone would be sufficient Security, if exercised, without Grace. 'Tis all one in this Dispute about what is just &amp; righteous, whe∣ther Men are born in a miserable State, by a Tendency to Ruin, which <HI>actually follows,</HI> and that <HI>justly;</HI> or whether they are born in such a State as tends to a Desert of Ruin, which <HI>might justly</HI> follow, and <HI>would actually follow,</HI> did not Grace prevent. For the Controversy is not, what Grace will do, but what Justice might do.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular on this Head, because it enervates many of the Reasonings and Conclusions by which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> makes out his Scheme; in which, he ar∣gues from that State which Mankind are in <HI>by divine Grace,</HI> yea, which he himself supposes to be by divine Grace; and yet not making any Allowance for this, he from hence draws Conclusions against what others suppose of the deplorable and ruin'd State, Mankind are in by the

Fall. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>He often speaks of Death and Affliction as coming on <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity in Consequence of his Sin; and in P. 20,21. and many other Places, he supposes that these Things come in Consequence of his Sin, not as a Punishment or a Calamity, but as a Benefit: But in P. 23. He supposes, these Things would be a great Calamity and Misery, if it were not for the Resurrection; which Resurrection he there, and in the fol∣lowing Pages, and many other Places, speaks of as being by Christ; and often speaks of it as being <HI>by the Grace</HI> of God in Christ.</P>
<P>P. 63, 64. speaking of our being subjected to Sorrow, Labour and Death, in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin; He represents these as Evils that are reversed, and turned into Advantages, and that we are delivered from <HI>through Grace</HI> in Christ. And in P. 65, 66, 67. He speaks of God's thus turning Death into an Advantage <HI>through Grace</HI> in Christ, as what vindicates the Justice of God in bringing Death by <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>P. 152, 156. 'Tis one Thing which he alledges against this Proposition of the Assembly of Divines, That we are by Nature Bond-slaves to <HI>Satan; That God hath been providing, from the Beginning of the World to this Day, various Means and Dispensations, to preserve and rescue Mankind from the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>P. 168, 169, 170. One Thing alledged, in Answer to that Objection against his Doctrine, That we are in worse Cir∣cumstances than <HI>Adam,</HI> is the Happy Circumstances we are under by the Provision and Means furnished, through <HI>free Grace in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>P. 228. Among other Things which he says, in answering that Argument against his Doctrine, and bro't to shew Men have Corruption by Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is a Law in our Members,—bringing us into Captivity to the Law of Sin and Death, spoken of <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. He allows that the Case of those who are under a Law threatning Death for every Sin (which Law he elsewhere says, <HI>shews us the natural and proper Demerit of Sin, and is perfectly consonant to everlasting Truth and Righteousness) must be quite deplorable, if they have no Relief from the Mercy of the Lawgiver.</HI></P>
<P>P. 367,—370. In Opposition to what is supposed of the mi∣serable State Mankind are brought into by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, one Thing he alledges, is, <HI>The noble Designs of Love, manif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted by advancing a new and happy Dispensation, founded on the Obedience and Righteousness of the Son of God;</HI> and that altho' by <HI>Adam</HI> we are subjected to Death, yet in this Dispensation a Resur∣rection is provided; And that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity are under a mild Dispensation of <HI>Grace</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>P, 388, 389. He vindicates God's Dealings with <HI>Adam,</HI> in placing him at first under the Rigour of Law, Transgress and die (which, as he expresses it, <HI>was putting his Happiness on a Feet extremely dangerous</HI>) by saying, <HI>that as God had before de∣termined in his own Breast, so he immediately established his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt upon a quite different-Bottom, namely, upon Grace.</HI></P>
<P>P. 398, 399. against what R. R. says, That God forsook Man when he fell, and that Mankind after <HI>Adams's</HI> Sin were born without the divine Favour &amp;c. He alledges among other Things, <HI>Christ's coming to be the Propitiation of the Sins of the whole World—And the Riches of God's Mercy in giving the Promise of a Redeemer to destroy the Works of the Devil,—that He caught his sunning falling Creatures in the Arms of his Grace▪</HI></P></NOTE> Some of his Arguments and Conclusions to this Effect, in order to be made good, must depend on such a Supposition as this; That God's Dispensations of Grace are Rectifications or Amendments of his foregoing Consti∣tutions and Proceedings, which were meerly legal; as tho' the Dispensations of Grace, which succeed those of meer Law, implied an Acknowledgement, that the preceeding Legal Constitution would be unjust, if left as it was, or at least very hard Dealing with Mankind; and that the other were of the Nature of a Satisfaction to his Creatures, for former Injuries, or hard Treatment: so that put together, the Injury with the Satisfaction, the legal and injurious Dispensation taken with the following good Dispensation, which our Author calls Grace, and the Unfairness or im∣proper Severity of the former amended by the Goodness of the latter, both together made up one Righteous Dis∣pensation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008118_0028_0F6B575541AED110"/>The Reader is desired to bear this in Mind, which I have said concerning the Interposition of divine Grace, it's not altering the Nature of Things, as they are in them∣selves; and accordingly, when I speak of such and such an evil Tendency of Things, belonging to the present

Nature and State of Mankind, understand Me to mean their Tendency <HI>as they are in themselves,</HI> abstracted from any Consideration of that Remedy the sovereign and infi∣nite Grace of God has provided.</P>
<P>Having premised these Things, I now proceed to say,</P>
<P>That Mankind are all naturally in such a State, as is attended, without Fail, with this Consequence or Issue; that they universally run themselves into that which is, in Effect, their own utter eternal Perdition, as being fi∣nally accursed of God, and the Subjects of his remediless Wrath, thro' Sin.</P>
<P>From which I infer, that the natural State of the Mind of Man is attended with a Propensity of Nature, which is prevalent and effectual, to such an Issue; and that there∣fore their Nature is corrupt and depraved with a moral Depravity, that amounts to and implies their utter un∣doing.</P>
<P>Here I would first consider the Truth of the Proposition; and then would shew the Certainty of the Consequences which I infer from it. If both can be clearly and cer∣tainly proved, then I trust, none will deny but that the Doctrine of original Depravity is evident, and so the False∣ness of Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Scheme demonstrated; the greatest Part of whose Book, that he calls <HI>the Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin</HI> &amp;c. is against the Doctrine of <HI>innate De∣pravity.</HI> In P. 383. He speaks of the Conveyance of a corrupt and sinful Nature to <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity as <HI>the grand Point</HI> to be proved by the Maintainers of the Doctrine of original Sin.</P>
<P>In order to demonstrate what is asserted in the Propo∣sition laid down, there is Need only that these two Things should be made manifest: <HI>One</HI> is this Fact, that all Man∣kind come into the World in such a State, as without fail comes to this Issue, namely, the universal Commission of Sin; or that every One who comes to act in the World as a moral Agent, is, in a greater or lesser Degree, guilty of Sin. The <HI>Other</HI> is, that all Sin deserves and exposes

P.379. He says as follows? <Q>The Law, I conceive, is not a Dispensation suitable to the Infirmity of the human Nature in our present State; Or it doth not seem congruous to the Goodness of God, to afford us no other Way of Salvation but by Law, which if we once transgress we are ruin'd for ever. For who then from the Beginning of the World could be saved? And therefore it seems to me, that the Law was not abso∣lutely intended to be a Rule for obtaining Life, even to <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise: <HI>Grace</HI> was the Dispensation God in∣tended Mankind should be under: And therefore Christ was fore-ordained before the Foundation of the World.</Q> There are various other Passages in this Author's Writings, of the like Kind.</NOTE></P>
<P>That every one of Mankind, at least of them that are capable of acting as moral Agents, are guilty of Sin (not now taking it for granted that they come guilty into the World) is a Thing most clearly and abundantly evident from the holy Scriptures; 1 Kings viii. 46. <HI>If any Man sin against thee, for there is no Man that sinneth not.</HI> Eccl. vii. 20. <HI>There is not a just Man upon Earth that doth Good, &amp; sinneth not.</HI> Job▪ ix.2,3. <HI>I know it is so of a Truth,</HI> (i. e as <HI>Bildad</HI> had just before said, That God would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast away a perfect Man &amp;c.) <HI>but how should Man be just with God?

his Sight: for by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</HI> So Gal. ii. 16. 1 Joh. i. 7,—10. <HI>If we walk in the Light, the Blood of Christ cleanseth us from all Sin. If we say that we have no Sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us. If we confess our Sins, he is faithful &amp; just to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanse us from all Unrighte∣ousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a Liar, and his Word is not in us.</HI> As in this Place, so in innumerable other Places, Confession and Repentance of Sin are spoken of as Duties proper for all; as also Prayer to God for Pardon of Sin; and Forgiveness of those that injure us, from that Motive, that we hope to be forgiven of God. Universal Guilt of Sin might also be demonstrated from the Appointment, and the declared. Use and End of the ancient Sacrifices; and also from the Ransom, which every one that was numbered in <HI>Israel,</HI> was directed to pay, to make Ato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment for his Soul, <HI>Exod.</HI> xxx. 11—16. All are represented, not only as being sinful, but as having great and manifold Iniquity, <HI>Job</HI> ix. 2, 3. <HI>Jam.</HI> iii. 1, 2.</P>
<P>There are many Scriptures which both declare, the uni∣versal Sinfulness of Mankind, and also that all Sin de∣serves and justly exposes to everlasting Destruction, under the Wrath and Curse of God; and so demonstrate both Parts of the Proposition I have laid down. To which Purpose, that in Gal. iii. 10. is exceeding full. <HI>For as many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that conti∣nueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> How manifestly is it implied in the Apostle's Meaning here, that there is no Man but what fails in some Instances of doing all Things that are writ∣ten in the Book of the Law, and therefore as many as have their Dependance on their fulfilling the Law, are un∣der that Curse which is pronounced on them that do fail of it? And hence the Apostle infers in the next Verse, <HI>that NO MAN is justified by the Law in the Sight of God:</HI> as he had said before in the preceeding Chapter,
<PB N="12" REF="008118_0032_0F6B575AE8794C30"/>
ver. 16, 17. <HI>By the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified;</HI> and that all that <HI>seek to be justified by the Works of the Law, are found Sinners.</HI> The Apostle shews us that he understands, that by this Place which he cites from <HI>Deuteronomy, the Scripture hath concluded,</HI> or <HI>shut up, all under Sin;</HI> as in Chap. iii. 22. So that here we are plainly taught, both that every one of Mankind is a Sinner, and that every Sinner is under the Curse of God.</P>
<P>To the like Purpose is that, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 14. and also 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 6, 7, 9. where the Law is called <HI>the Letter that: ills, the Ministration of Death,</HI> and <HI>the Mini∣stration of Condemnation.</HI> The Wrath, Condemnation and Death which is threaten'd in the Law to all its Trans∣gressors, is final Perdition, the second Death, eternal Ruin; as is very plain, and is confess'd. And this Punishment which the Law threatens for every Sin, is a just Punish∣ment; being what every Sin truly deserves; God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law being a righteous Law, and the Sentence of it a righteous Sentence.</P>
<P>All these Things are what Dr.<HI>T.</HI> himself confesses and asserts. He says, that the Law of God requires perfect Obedience. (<HI>Note</HI> on Rom. vii. 6. P. 391, 392.) <Q>God can never require imperfect Obedience, or by his holy Law allow us to be guilty of any one Sin, how small soever. And if the Law as a Rule of Duty were in any Respect abolished, then we might in some Respects transgress the Law, and yet not be guilty of Sin. The moral Law, or Law of Nature, is the Truth, everlast∣ing, unchangeable; and therefore, as such, can never be abrogated. On the contrary, our Lord Jesus Christ has promulgated it a new under the Gospel, fuller and clearer than it was in the Mosaical Constitution, or any where else;—having added to its Precepts the Sanction of his own divine Authority.</Q> And many Things which he says, imply that all Mankind do in some Degree transgress the Law. In P. 228. speaking of what may be gather'd from <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. &amp; viii. he says, <Q>We are
<PB N="13" REF="008118_0033_0F6B575BAE827A98"/>
very apt, in a World full of Temptation, to be de∣ceived, and drawn into Sin by bodily Appetites &amp;c. And the Case of those who are under a Law threatning Death to every Sin, must be quite deplora∣ble, if they have no Relief from the Mercy of the Lawgiver.</Q> But this is very fully declared in what he says in his Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 20. P. 378, 379. His Words are as follows; <Q>Indeed, as a Rule of Action prescribing our Duty, it (the Law) always was, and al∣ways must be a Rule ordain'd for obtaining Life; but not as a Rule of Justification, not as it subjects to Death for every Transgression. For if it COULD in it's utmost Rigour have given us Life, then, as the Apostle argues, it would have been against the Promises of God.mdash;For if there had been a Law, in the strict and rigorous Sense of Law, WHICH COULD HAVE MADE US LIVE, verily Justification should have been by the Law. But he supposes, no such Law was ever given: and therefore there is Need and Room enough for the Promises of Grace; Or as he argues, <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 21. It would have frustrated, or rendred useless the Grace of God. For if Justification came by the Law, then truly Christ is dead in vain, then he died to accomplish what was, or MIGHT HAVE BEEN EFFECTED by Law it self, without his Death. Certainly the Law was not brought in among the <HI>Jews</HI> to be a Rule of Justification, or to recover 'em out of a State of Death, and to procure Life by their sinless Obedience to it: for in this, as well as in another Respect, it was WEAK; not in it self, but through the WEAKNESS of our Flesh, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 3. The Law, I conceive, is not a Dispensation <HI>suitable to the Infirmity of the human Nature</HI> in our present State; or it doth not seem con∣gruous to the Goodness of God to afford us no other Way of Salvation, but by LAW; WHICH IF WE ONCE TRANSGRESS, WE ARE RUIN'D FOR EVER. FOR WHO THEN FROM THE BE∣GINNING OF THE WORLD COULD BE SA∣VED?</Q>
<PB N="14" REF="008118_0034_0F6B575C0C4C1DF8"/>
How clear and express are these Things, that no one of Mankind from the Beginning of the World can ever be justified by Law, because every one trans∣gresses it? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am sensible, these Things are quite inconsistent with what he says elsewhere, of <HI>sufficient Power in all Mankind constantly to do the whole Duty which God requires of 'em,</HI> without a Ne∣cessity of breaking God's Law <HI>in any Degree.</HI> (P. 339, 340, 344, 348.) But I hope, the Reader will not think me accoun∣table for his Inconsistences.</NOTE></P>
<P>And here also we see, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> declares, that by the Law Men are sentenc'd to <HI>everlasting Ruin</HI> for one Trans∣gression. To the like Purpose he often expresses himself. So, P. 207. <Q>The Law requireth the most extensive O∣bedience, discovering Sin in all it's Branches.—It gives Sin a deadly Force, subjecting every Transgression to the Penalty of Death; and yet supplieth neither Help nor Hope to the Sinner; but leaveth him under the Power of Sin, and Sentence of Death.</Q> In P. 213. He speaks of the Law as <HI>extending to Lust and irregular Desires, and to every Branch and Principle of Sin; and even to its latent Principles, and minutest Branches.</HI> Again (<HI>Note</HI> on <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 6. P. 391.) <HI>to every Sin, how small soever.</HI> And when he speaks of the Law subjecting every Transgression to the Penalty of Death, he means eternal Death, as he from Time to Time explains the Matter. In P. 212. He speaks of the Law <HI>in the con∣demning Power of it, as binding us in everlasting Chains.</HI> In P. 396. He says, that Death which is the Wages of Sin, is the <HI>second Death:</HI> And this P. 78. he explains of <HI>final Perdition.</HI> In his <HI>Key,</HI> P. 155. § 264. he says, <Q>The Curse of the Law subjected Men for every Trans∣gression to <HI>eternal Death.</HI></Q> So in <HI>Note</HI> on <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 20. P. 371. <Q>The Law of <HI>Moses</HI> subjected those who were under it to Death, meaning by Death eternal Death.</Q> These are his Words.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="008118_0035_0F6B575CCCA4E870"/>He also supposes, that this Sentence of the Law, thus subjecting Men for <HI>every,</HI> even the <HI>least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>every minutest Branch,</HI> and <HI>latent Principle of Sin,</HI> to so dread∣ful a Punishment, is <HI>just and righteous, agreable to Truth</HI> and the <HI>Nature of Things,</HI> or to the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>proper Demerits of Sin.</HI> This he is very full in. Thus in P. 21. <Q>It was Sin (says he) which subjected to Death by the Law, JUSTLY threatening Sin with Death. Which Law was given us, that Sin might appear; might be set forth IN IT'S PROPER COLOURS; when we saw it subjected us to Death by a Law PERFECTLY HOLY, JUST, AND GOOD; That Sin by the Commandment, by the Law, might be represented WHAT IT REALLY IS, an exceeding great and deadly Evil.</Q> So in Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 20. P. 380. <Q>The Law or Ministration of Death, as it subjects to Death for every Transgression, is still of Use to shew THE NATURAL AND PROPER DEMERIT OF SIN. <HI>Ibid.</HI> P. 371, 372. The Language of the Law, Dying thou shalt die, is to be understood of the <HI>Demerit</HI> of the Transgression, that which it <HI>deserves.</HI></Q> <HI>Ibid.</HI> P. 379. <Q>The Law was add∣ed, saith Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> on the Place, because the <HI>Israelites,</HI> the Posterity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> were Transgressours as well as other Men, to shew them their Sins, and the Punishment &amp; Death, which in STRICT JUSTICE they incurred by them. And this appears to be a true Comment on <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 13.—Sin, by Vertue of the Law, subjected you to Death for this End, that Sin, working Death in us by that which is <HI>holy, just &amp; good,</HI> PERFECTLY CONSONANT TO EVERLAST∣ING TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS—Consequently every Sin is <HI>in strict Justice deserving</HI> of Wrath &amp; Punishment; and the Law in its Rigour was given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> to set home this awful Truth upon their Consciences, to shew them the evil and per∣nicious NATURE of Sin; And that being conscious they had broke the Law of God, this might convince them of the great Need they had of the FAVOUR
<PB N="16" REF="008118_0036_0F6B575DDF3B9EE8"/>
of the Lawgiver, and oblige them, by Faith in his GOODNESS, to fly to his MERCY for Pardon and Salvation.</Q></P>
<P>If the Law be holy, just and good, a Constitution per∣fectly agreeable to God's Holiness, Justice and Goodness; then he might have put it exactly in Execution, agreably to all these his Perfections. Our Author himself says, P. 409. <Q>How that Constitution, which establishes a Law, the making of which is inconsistent with the Justice and Goodness of God, and the Executing of it inconsistent with his Holiness, can be a righteous Constitution, I confess, is quite beyond my Comprehension.</Q></P>
<P>Now the Reader is left to judge whether it ben't most plainly and fully agreeable to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s own Doctrine, that there never was any one Person from the Beginning of the World, who came to act in the World as a moral Agent, and that it is not to be hoped there ever will be any, but what is a Sinner or Transgressor of the Law of God; and that therefore this proves to be the Issue and Event of Things, with respect to all Mankind in all Ages, that, by the natural and proper Demerit of their own Sinfulness, and in the Judgment of the Law of God, which is perfectly consonant to Truth, and exhibits Things in their true Colours, they are the proper Subjects of the Curse of God, eternal Death, and everlasting Ruin; which must be the actual Consequence, unless the Grace or Fa∣vour of the Lawgiver interpose, and Mercy prevail for their Pardon and Salvation. The Reader has seen also how agreeable this is to the Doctrine of the holy Scrip∣ture.</P>
<P>And if so, and what has been observed concerning the Interposition of divine Grace be remember'd, namely, that this alters not the Nature of Things as they are in themselves, and that it don't in the least affect the State of the Controversy we are upon, concerning the true Nature and Tendency of the State that Mankind come into the World in, whether Grace prevents the fatal Effect or no; I say, if these Things are considered, I trust, none will
<PB N="17" REF="008118_0037_0F6B575E861F5648"/>
deny, that the Proposition that was laid down, is fully proved, as agreeable to the Word of God, and Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> own Words; <HI>viz.</HI> That Mankind are all naturally in such a State, as is attended, without fail, with this Consequence or Issue, that they universally are the Subjects of, that Guilt and Sinfulness, which is, in Effect, their utter and eternal Ruin, being cast wholly out of the Favour of God, and subjected to his everlasting Wrath and Curse.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>It follows from the Proposition proved in the fore∣going Section, that all Mankind are under the Influ∣ence of a prevailing effectual Tendency in their Nature, to that Sin and Wickedness, which implies their utter and eternal Ruin.</HEAD>
<P>THE Proposition laid down being proved, the Conse∣quence of it remains to be made out, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Mind of Man has a <HI>natural Tendency</HI> or <HI>Propensity</HI> to that Event, which has been shewn universally and in∣fallibly to take Place; (if this ben't sufficiently evident of it self, without Proof;) and that this is a <HI>corrupt</HI> or <HI>depraved</HI> Propensity.</P>
<P>I shall here consider the former Part of this Conse∣quence, namely, whether such an universal, constant, in∣fallible Event is truly a Proof of the Being of any <HI>Ten∣dency</HI> or <HI>Propensity</HI> to that Event; leaving the <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>corrupt Nature</HI> of such a Propensity to be considered af∣terwards.</P>
<P>If any shall say, they don't think that it's being a thing universal and infallible in Event, that Mankind com∣mit some Sin, is a Proof of a prevailing Tendency to Sin; because they don't only sin, but also do Good, and per∣haps more Good than Evil: Let them remember, that the Question at present is not, How much Sin there is a Tendency to; but, Whether there be a prevailing Propensi∣ty to that Issue, which it is allowed all Men do actually
<PB N="18" REF="008118_0038_0F6B5762F63136F8"/>
come to, that all fail of keeping the Law perfectly;—Whe∣ther there ben't a Tendency to such Imperfection of Obe∣dience, as always without fail comes to pass; to that De∣gree of Sinfulness, at least, which all fall into; and so to that utter Ruin, which that Sinfulness implies and infers. Whether an effectual Propensity to this be worth the Name of Depravity, because of the Good that may be supposed to balance it, shall be considered by and by. If it were so, that all Mankind, in all Nations and Ages, were at least one Day in their Lives deprived of the Use of their Reason, and run raving mad; or that all even every individual Person, once cut their own Throats, or put out their own Eyes; it might be an Evidence of some Ten∣dency in the Nature or natural State of Mankind to such an Event; tho' they might exercise Reason many more Days than they were distracted, and were kind to and tender of themselves oftener than they mortally and cru∣elly wounded themselves.</P>
<P>To determine whether the unfailing Constancy of the above-named Event be an Evidence of Tendency, let it be considered,—What can be meant by <HI>Tendency,</HI> but a pre∣vailing Liableness or Exposedness to such or such an E∣vent? Wherein consists the Notion of any such thing, but some stated Prevalence or Preponderation in the Nature or State of Causes or Occasions, that is followed <HI>by,</HI> and so proves to be effectual <HI>to,</HI> a stated Prevalence or Common∣ness of any particular Kind of Effect? Or, something in the permanent State of Things, concerned in bringing a cer∣tain Sort of Event to pass, which is a Foundation for the Constancy, or strongly prevailing Probability, of such an Event? If we mean this by Tendency (as I know not what else can be meant by it, but this, or something like this) then it is manifest, that where we see a stated Pre∣valence of any Kind of Effect or Event, there is a Tendency to that Effect in the Nature and State of it's Causes. A common and steady Effect shews, that there is some-where a Preponderation, a prevailing Exposedness or Liableness in the State of Things, to what comes so
<PB N="19" REF="008118_0039_0F6B5763A19F3D20"/>
steadily to pass. The natural Dictate of Reason sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws, that where there is an Effect, there is a Cause, and a Cause sufficient for the Effect; because, if it were not sufficient, it would not be effectual: and that therefore, where there is a stated Prevalence of the Effect, there is a stated Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣valence in the Cause: A steady Effect argues a steady Cause. We obtain a Notion of such a Thing as Tenden∣cy, no other Way than by Observation: And we can ob∣serve nothing but Events: And 'tis the Commonness or Constancy of Events, that gives us a Notion of Tendency in all Cases. Thus we judge of Tendencies in the natural World. Thus we judge of the Tendencies or Propensi∣ties of Nature in Minerals, Vegetables, Animals, rational and irrational Creatures. A Notion of a stated Tendency or fix'd Propensity is not obtain'd by observing only a single Event. A stated Preponderation in the Cause or Occasion, is argued only by a stated Prevalence of the Effect. If a Die be once thrown, and it falls on a par∣ticular Side, we don't argue from hence, that that Side is the heaviest; but if it be thrown without Skill or Care, many Thousands or Millions of Times going, and con∣stantly fails on the same Side, we have not the least Doubt in our Minds, but that there is something of Pro∣pensity in the Case, by superiour Weight of that Side, or in some other respect. How ridiculous would he make himself, who should earnestly dispute against any Tenden∣cy in the State of Things to Cold in the Winter, or Heat in the Summer; or should stand to it, that altho' it often happen'd that Water quench'd Fire, yet there was no Tendency in it to such an Effect?</P>
<P>In the Case we are upon, the human Nature, as existing in such an immense Diversity of Persons and Circumstan∣ces, and never failing in any one Instance, of coming to that Issue, <HI>viz.</HI> that Sinfulness which implies extreme Misery and eternal Ruin, is as the Die often cast. For it alters not the Case, in the least, as to the Evidence of Tendency, whether the Subject of the constant Event be an Individual, or a Nature and Kind. Thus, if there be a
<PB N="20" REF="008118_0040_0F6B5764C2497EB8"/>
Succession of Trees of the same Sort, proceeding one from another, from the Beginning of the World, growing in all Countries, Soils and Climates, and otherwise in (as it were) an infinite Variety of Circumstances, all bearing ill Fruit; it as much proves the Nature and Tendency of the <HI>Kind▪</HI> as if it were only one Individual Tree▪ that had remain'd from the Beginning of the World, had often been transplanted into different Soils &amp;c. and had conti∣nu'd to bear only bad Fruit. So, if there were a particu∣lar Family, which, from Generation to Generation, and thro' every Remove to innumerable different Coun∣tries and Places of Abode, all died of a Consumption, or all run distracted, or all murder'd themselves, it would be as much an Evidence of the Tendency of something in the Nature or Constitution of that Race, as it would be of the Tendency of something in the Nature or State of an Individual, if some one Person had liv'd all that Time, and some remarkable Event had often appeared in him, which he had been the Agent or Subject of, from Year to Year, and from Age to Age, continually and without Fail. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here may be observed the Weakness of that Objection, made against the Validity of the Argument for a fix'd Propensity to Sin, from the Constancy and Universality of the Event, That <HI>Adam</HI> sin'd in one Instance, without a fix'd Propensity. Without Doubt a single Event is an Evidence, that there was some Cause or Occasion of that Event: But the thing we are speaking of, is a <HI>fix'd Cause:</HI> Propensity is a <HI>stated</HI> continued thing. We justly argue, that a <HI>stated Effect</HI> must have a <HI>stated Cause;</HI> and truly observe, that we obtain the Notion of Tendency, or <HI>stated Preponderation</HI> in Causes, no other Way than by observing a stated Prevalence of a parti∣cular Kind of Effect. But who ever argues a fix'd Pro∣pensity from a single Effect? And is it not strange arguing, that because an Event which once comes to pass, don't prove any stated Tendency, therefore the unfailing Constancy of an Event is an Evidence of no such thing?—But because Dr.<HI>T.</HI> makes so much of this Objection, from <HI>Adam's</HI> sinning without a Propensity, I shall hereafter consider it more par∣ticularly, in the Beginning of the 9th <HI>Section</HI> of this Chap∣ter; where will also be considered what is objected from the Fall of the Angels.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="008118_0041_0F6B5765D143C8D8"/>Thus a Propensity attending the present Nature or na∣tural State of Mankind, eternally to ruin themselves by Sin, may certainly be infer'd from apparent and acknow∣ledged Fact.—And I would now observe further, that not only does this follow from Facts that are acknowledged by Dr. <HI>T.</HI> but the Things he <HI>asserts,</HI> the Expressions and Words which he <HI>uses,</HI> do plainly imply that all Mankind have such a Propensity; yea, one of the highest Kind, a Propensity that is <HI>invincible,</HI> or a Tendency which really amounts to a fix'd constant unfailing <HI>Necessity.</HI> There is a plain Confession of a Propensity or Proneness to Sin, P. 143.—"Man, who drinketh in Iniquity like Water; who is attended with so many sensual Appetites, and so APT to indulge them—" And again P. 228. "WE ARE VERY APT, in a World full of Temptation, to be deceiv'd, &amp; drawn into Sin by bodily Appetites."—If we are <HI>very apt</HI> or prone to be drawn into Sin by bodily Appetites, and <HI>sinfully to indulge them,</HI> and very apt or prone <HI>to yield to Temptation to Sin,</HI> then we are <HI>prone to Sin:</HI> for to yield to Temptation to Sin, is <HI>sinful.</HI>—In the same Page he represents, that on this Account, and on Account of the Consequences of this, <HI>the Case of those who are under a Law threatning Death for every Sin, must be quite deplorable, if they have no Relief from the Mercy of the Lawgiver.</HI> Which implies, that their Case is hopeless, as to an escape from Death, the Punishment of Sin, by any other Means than God's Mercy. And that implies, that there is such an <HI>Aptness</HI> to yield to Tempta∣tion to Sin, that 'tis hopeless that any of Mankind should wholly avoid it. But he speaks of it elsewhere, over and over, as truly <HI>impossible,</HI> or what <HI>can't be;</HI> as in the Words which were cited in the last <HI>Section,</HI> from his Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 20. where he repeatedly speaks of the Law, which subjects us to Death for every Transgression, as what <HI>CANNOT GIVE LIFE;</HI> and represents, that if God offer'd us no other Way of Salvation, <HI>no Man from the Beginning of the World COULD be saved.</HI> In the same Place he with Approbation cites Mr. <HI>Locke's</HI> Words,
<PB N="22" REF="008118_0042_0F6B576683019B88"/>
in which, speaking of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> he says, <Q>All En∣deavours after Righteousness was LOST LABOUR, since any one Slip forfeited Life, &amp; it was IMPOSSI∣BLE for them to expect ought but Death.</Q> Our Author speaks of it as impossible for the Law requiring sinless O∣bedience, to give Life, <HI>not that the Law was weak in it self, but thro' the Weakness of our Flesh.</HI> Therefore, he says, <HI>he conceives the Law not to be a Dispensation suitable to the Infirmity of the human Nature in its pre∣sent State.</HI> These Things amount to a full Confession, that the Proneness in Men to Sin, and to a Demerit of and just Exposedness to eternal Ruin by Sin, is univer∣sally invincible, or, which is the same Thing, amounts to absolute invincible Necessity; which surely is the highest Kind of Tendency, or Propensity: and that not the less for his laying this Propensity to our Infirmity or Weakness, which may seem to intimate some Defect, rather than any Thing positive: And 'tis agreable to the Sentiments of the best Divines, that all Sin originally comes from a de∣fective or privative Cause. But Sin don't cease to be Sin, or a Thing not justly exposing to eternal Ruin (as is imply'd in Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> own Words) for arising from In∣firmity or Defect; nor does an invincible Propensity to Sin cease to be a Propensity to such Demerit of eternal Ruin, because the Proneness arises from such a Cause.</P>
<P>It is manifest, that this Tendency which has been prov∣ed, don't consist in any particular external Circumstances, that some or many are in, peculiarly tempting and influ∣encing their Minds; but is <HI>inherent,</HI> and is seated in that <HI>Nature</HI> which is common to all Mankind, which they car∣ry with them wherever they go, and still remains the same, however Circumstances may differ. For it is implied in what has been proved, and shewn to be confess'd, that the same Event comes to pass in all Circumstances, that any of Mankind ever are or can be under in the World. <HI>In God's Sight no Man living can be justified;</HI> but all are Sinners, and exposed to Condemnation. This is true of Persons of all Constitutions, Capacities, Conditions, Man∣ners,
<PB N="23" REF="008118_0043_0F6B5767A7E7FCF8"/>
Opinions and Educations; in all Countries, Climates, Nations and Ages; and through all the mighty Changes and Revolutions, which have come to pass in the habitable World.</P>
<P>We have the same Evidence, that the Propensity in this Case lies in the Nature of the Subject, and don't arise from any particular Circumstances, as we have in any Case whatsoever; which is only by the Effects appearing to be the same in all Changes of Time and Place, and un∣der all Varieties of Circumstances. It is in this Way only we judge, that any Propensities, which we observe in Mankind, are such as are seated in their Nature, in all other Cases. 'Tis thus we judge of the mutual Propensity be∣twixt the Sexes, or of the Dispositions which are exercised in any of the natural Passions or Appetites, that they truly belong to the Nature of Man; because they are observed in Mankind in general, through all Countries, Nations and Ages, and in all Conditions.</P>
<P>If any should say, Tho' it be evident that there is a Tendency in the State of Things to this general Event, that all Mankind should fail of perfect Obedience, and should sin, and incur a Demerit of eternal Ruin; and also that this Tendency don't lie in any distinguishing Circumstances of any particular People, Person or Age: yet it may not lie in Man's Nature, but in the general Con∣stitution &amp; Frame of this World, into which Men are born: Tho' the Nature of Man may be good, without any evil Propensity inherent in it; yet the Nature and universal State of this earthly World may be such as to be full of so many and strong Temptations every where, and of such a powerful Influence on such a Creature as Man, dwell∣ing in so infirm a Body &amp;c. that the Result of the whole may be, a strong and infallible Tendency <HI>in such a State of Things,</HI> to the Sin and eternal Ruin of every one of Mankind.</P>
<P>To this I would reply, that such an Evasion will not at all avail to the Purpose of those whom I oppose in this Controversy. It alters not the Case as to this Question,
<PB N="24" REF="008118_0044_0F6B5768B8832DA8"/>
Whether Man is not a Creature that in his present State is depraved and ruin'd by Propensities to Sin. If any Creature be of such a Nature that it proves evil in it's proper Place, or in the Situation which God has assigned it in the Universe, it is of an evil Nature. That Part of the System is not good, which is not good in it's Place in the System; and those inherent Qualities of that Part of the System, which are not good, but corrupt, in that Place, are justly looked upon as evil inherent Qualities. That Propensity is truly esteemed to belong to the <HI>Nature</HI> of any Being, or to be inherent in it, that is the necessary Consequence of it's Nature, considered together with it's proper Situation in the universal System of Ex∣istence, whether that Propensity be good or bad. 'Tis the <HI>Nature</HI> of a Stone, to be heavy; but yet, if it were placed, as it might be, at a Distance from this World, it would have no such Quality. But seeing a Stone is of such a Nature, that it will have this Quality or Tenden∣cy, in it's proper Place, here in this World, where God has made it, 'tis properly look'd upon as a Propensity be∣longing to it's Nature: And if it be a good Propensity here in it's proper Place, then it is a good Quality of it's Nature; But if it be contrariwise, it is an evil natural Quality. So, if Mankind are of such a Nature, that they have an universal effectual Tendency to Sin and Ruin, in this World, where God has made and placed them, this is to be looked upon as a pernicious Tendency belonging to their Nature. There is, perhaps, scarce any such thing in Beings not independent and self-existent, as any Power or Tendency, but what has some Dependance on other Beings, which they stand in some Connection with, in the universal System of Existence: Propensities are no Propensities, any otherwise, than as taken with their Objects. Thus it is with the Tendencies observed in natural Bodies, such as Gravity, Magnetism, Electricity &amp;c. And thus it is with the Propensities observed in the vari∣ous Kinds of Animals; and thus it is with most of the Propensities in created Spirits.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="008118_0045_0F6B5768D322F0E8"/>It may further be observed, that it is exactly the same thing, as to the Controversy concerning an Agreeableness with God's moral Perfections of such a Disposal of Things, that Man should come into the World in a depraved ruin'd State, by a Propensity to Sin and Ruin; whether God has so ordered it, that this Propensity should lie in his Nature considered alone, or with Relation to it's Situa∣tion in the Universe, and it's Connection with other Parts of the System to which the Creator has united it; which is as much of God's ordering, as Man's Nature it self, most simply considered.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> (P. 188, 189.) speaking of the Attempt of Some to solve the Difficulty of God's being the Author of our Nature, and yet that our Nature is polluted, by suppo∣sing that God makes the Soul pure, but unites it to a polluted Body [or a Body so made, as tends to pollute the Soul;] He cries out of it as weak and insufficient, and <HI>too gross to be admitted:</HI> For, says he, <HI>Who infused the Soul into the Body? And if it is polluted by being in∣fused into the Body, who is the Author and Cause of it's Pollution? And who created the Body</HI> &amp;c?—But is not the Case just the same, as to those who suppose that God made the Soul pure, and places it in a polluted World, or a World tending by it's natural State in which it is made, to pollute the Soul, or to have such an Influence upon it, that it shall without fail be polluted with Sin, and eter∣nally ruin'd? Here, mayn't I also cry out, on as good Grounds as Dr. <HI>T.</HI>—Who placed the Soul here in this World? And if the World be polluted, or so constituted as naturally and infallibly to pollute the Soul with Sin, who is the Cause of this Pollution? And, who created the World—?</P>
<P>Tho' in the Place now cited, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> so insists upon it, that God must be answerable for the Pollution of the Soul, if he has infused or put the Soul into a Body that tends to pollute it; yet this is the very Thing which he himself supposes to be Fact, with respect to the Soul's being cre∣ated by God, in such a Body as it is, and in such a World
<PB N="26" REF="008118_0046_0F6B5769A3D078E8"/>
as it is; in a Place which I have already had Occasion to observe, where he says, <Q>We are <HI>apt,</HI> in a World full of Temptation, to be drawn into Sin by bodily Appe∣tites.</Q> And if so, according to his Way of Reasoning, God must be the Author and Cause of this Aptness to be drawn into Sin. Again P. 143. we have these Words, <Q><HI>Who drinketh in Iniquity like Water; who is attend∣ed with so many sensual Appetites, and so apt to in∣dulge them.</HI></Q> In these Words our Author in Effect says the individual thing that he cries out of as so <HI>gross, viz.</HI> The Tendency of the Body, as God has made it, to pollute the Soul, which he has infused into it. These sensual Appetites, which incline the Soul, or make it <HI>apt</HI> to a sinful <HI>Indulgence,</HI> are either from the Body which God hath made, or otherwise a Proneness to sinful Indul∣gence is immediately and originally seated in the Soul it self, which will not mend the Matter, for Dr. <HI>Taylor.</HI></P>
<P>I would here lastly observe, that our Author insists upon it, P. 317, 318. That this lower World where we dwell, in its present State, <Q>Is as it was, when, upon a Review, God pronounced it, and all it's Furniture, very good.—And that the present Form and Furniture of the Earth is full of God's Riches, Mercy &amp; Goodness, and of the most evident Tokens of his Love &amp; Bounty to the Inhabitants.</Q> If so, there can be no Room for such an Evasion of the Evidences from Fact, of the uni∣versal infallible Tendency of Man's Nature to Sin &amp; eternal Perdition, as, that the Tendency there is to this Issue, don't lie in Man's Nature, but in the general Constitution and Frame of this earthly World, which God hath made to be the Habitation of Mankind.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>That Propensity which has been proved to be in the Nature of all Mankind, must be a very evil, de∣praved and pernicious Propensity; making it manifest that the Soul of Man, as it is by Nature, is in a corrupt, fallen and ruin'd State: which is the other Part of the Consequence, drawn from the Proposition laid down in the first Section.</HEAD>
<P>THE Question to be considered, in Order to deter∣mine whether Man's Nature is not <HI>depraved and ruin'd,</HI> is not, Whether he is not inclined to perform as many <HI>good Deeds</HI> as <HI>bad ones?</HI> But, Which of these two he preponderates to, in the Frame of his Heart, and State of his Nature, <HI>a State of Innocence and Righteousness, and Favour with God;</HI> or <HI>a State of Sin, Guiltiness and Abhorrence in the Sight of God?</HI>—Persevering sinless Righteousness, or else the Guilt of Sin, is the Alternative, the Decision of which depends (as is confessed) according to the Nature and Truth of Things, as they are in them∣selves, and according to the Rule of Right and of perfect Justice, Man's being approved and accepted of his Maker, and eternally blessed as good; or his being rejected, thrown away and cursed as bad. And therefore the Determi∣nation of the Tendency of Man's Heart and Nature with respect to these Terms, is that which is to be look'd at, in Order to determine whether his Nature is good or evil, pure or corrupt, sound or ruin'd. If such be Man's Na∣ture, and state of his Heart, that he has an infallibly ef∣fectual Propensity to the latter of those Terms; then it is wholly impertinent, to talk of <HI>the innocent and kind Actions, even of Criminals themselves, surpassing their Crimes in Numbers; and of the prevailing Innocence, good Nature, Industry, Felicity and Chearfulness of the greater Part of Mankind.</HI> Let never so many Thou∣sands, or Millions of Acts of Honesty, good Nature &amp;c.
<PB N="28" REF="008118_0048_0F6B576B02FCB1B8"/>
be supposed; yet, by the Supposition, there is an unfail∣ing Propensity to such moral Evil, as in it's dreadful Con∣sequences infinitely out-weighs all Effects or Consequen∣ces of any supposed Good. Surely that Tendency, which, in Effect, is an infallible Tendency to eternal Destruction, is an infinitely dreadful &amp; pernicious Tendency: And that Nature &amp; Frame of Mind, which implies such a Tendency, must be an infinitely dreadful &amp; pernicious Frame of Mind. It would be much more absurd, to suppose, that such a State of Nature is good, or not bad, under a Notion of Men's doing more honest and kind things, than evil ones; than to say, the State of that Ship is good, to cross the Atlantick Ocean in, that is such as cannot hold together through the Voyage, but will infallibly founder and sink by the Way; under a Notion that it may probably go great Part of the Way before it sinks, or that it will pro∣ceed and sail above Water more Hours than it will be in sinking:—Or, to pronounce thatRoad a good Road to go to such a Place, the greater Part of which is plain and safe, tho' some Parts of it are dangerous, and certainly fatal to them that travel in it; or to call that a good Pro∣pensity, which is an inflexible Inclination to travel in such a Way.</P>
<P>A Propensity to that Sin which brings God's eternal Wrath and Curse (which has been proved to belong to the Nature of Man) is not evil, only as it is <HI>calamitous</HI> and <HI>sorrowful,</HI> ending in great <HI>natural Evil;</HI> but it is <HI>odious</HI> too, and <HI>detestable;</HI> as, by the Supposition, it tends to that <HI>moral Evil,</HI> by which the Subject becomes odious in the Sight of God, and liable, as such, to be condemned, and utterly rejected and cursed by him. This also makes it evident, that the State which it has been proved Mankind are in, is a corrupt State in a <HI>moral Sense,</HI> that it is in∣consistent with the Fulfilment of the Law of God, which is the Rule of moral Rectitude and Goodness. That Tendency, which is opposite to that which the moral Law requires and insists upon, and prone to that which the moral Law utterly forbids, and eternally condemns
<PB N="29" REF="008118_0049_0F6B576CEE881818"/>
the Subject for, is doubtless a corrupt Tendency, in a mo∣ral Sense.</P>
<P>So that this Depravity is both <HI>odious,</HI> and also <HI>perni∣cious,</HI> fatal and destructive, in the highest Sense, as ine∣vitably tending to that which implies Man's eternal Ruin; it shews, that Man, as he is by Nature, is in a deplorable and undone State, in the highest Sense. And this proves that Men don't come into the World perfectly innocent in the Sight of God, and without any just Exposedness to his Displeasure. For the being by Nature in a lost and ruin'd State, in the highest Sense, is not consistent with be∣ing by Nature in a State of Favour with God.</P>
<P>But if any should still insist on a Notion of Men's good Deeds exceeding their bad ones, and that seeing the good that is in Men more than countervails the Evil, they can't be properly denominated evil; All Persons and Things being most properly denominated from that which prevails, and has the Ascendant in them: I would say further, That</P>
<P>I presume it will be allowed, that if there is in Man's Nature a Tendency to Guilt and Ill-Desert, in a vast Over-balance to Virtue &amp; Merit; or a Propensity to that Sin, the Evil and Demerit of which is so great, that the Value and Merit that is in him, or in all the virtuous Acts that ever he performs, are as Nothing to it; then truly the Nature of Man may be said to be corrupt and evil.</P>
<P>That this is the true Case, may be demonstrated by what is evident of the infinite Heinousness of Sin against God, from the Nature of things. The Heinousness of this must rise in some Proportion to the Obligation we are under to regard the divine Being; and that must be in some Pro∣portion to his Worthiness of Regard; which doubtless is infinitely beyond the Worthiness of any of our Fellow∣Creatures. But the Merit of our Respect or Obedience to God is not infinite. The Merit of Respect to any Being don't increase, but is rather diminish'd in Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣tion to the Obligations we are under in strict Justice to pay him that Respect. There is no great Merit in paying a
<PB N="30" REF="008118_0050_0F6B576D93E5FA98"/>
Debt we owe, and by the highest possible Obligations in strict Justice are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bliged to pay; but there is great Demerit in refusing to pay it. That on such Accounts as those there is an infinite Demerit in all Sin against God, which must therefore immensely outweigh all the Merit which can be supposed to be in our Virtue, I think, is capable of full Demonstration; and that the Futility of the Objection. which some have made against the Argument, might most plainly be demonstrated. But I shall omit a particular Consideration of the Evidence of this Matter from the Nature of Things, as I study Brevity, and left any should cry out, <HI>Metaphysicks!</HI> as the Manner of some is, when any Argument is handled, against any Tenet they are fond of, with a close and exact Consideration of the Nature of Things. And this is not so necessary in the present Case, in as much as the Point asserted, namely, that he who commits any one Sin, has Guilt and Ill-Desert which is so great, that the Value and Merit of all the Good which it is possible he should do in his whole Life, is as Nothing to it; I say, this Point is not only evident by <HI>Metaphysicks,</HI> but is plainly demonstrated by what has been shewn to be <HI>Fact,</HI> with respect to God's own Constitutions and Dispensations towards Mankind: As particularly by this, that whatever Acts of Virtue and Obedience a Man per∣forms, yet if he tresp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses in one Point, is guilty of any the least Sin, He, according to the Law of God, and so according to the exact Truth of Things and the proper Demerit of Sin, is exposed to be wholly cast out of Fa∣vour with God, and subjected to his Curse, to be utterly and eternally destroyed. This has been proved; and shewn to be the Doctrine which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> abundantly teaches. But how can it be agreeable to the Nature of Things, and exactly consonant to everlasting Truth and Righteousness, thus to deal with a Creature for the least sinful Act, tho' he should perform ever so many Thousands of honest and virtuous Acts, to countervail the evil of that Sin? Or how can it be agreeable to the exact Truth and real Demerit of Things, thus wholly to cast off the deficient
<PB N="31" REF="008118_0051_0F6B576E0476D280"/>
Creature, without any Regard to the Merit of all his good Deeds, unless that be in Truth the Case, that the Value and Merit of all those good Actions bear no Proportion to the Heinousness of the least Sin? If it were not so, one would think, that however the offending Person might have some proper Punishment, yet seeing there is so much Virtue to lay in the Balance against the Guilt, it would be agreeable to the Nature of Things, that he should find some Favour, and not be altogether rejected, and made the Subject of perfect and eternal Destruction; and thus no Account at all be made of all his Virtue, so much as to procure him the least Relief or Hope. How can such a Constitution <HI>represent Sin in its proper Colours,</HI> and <HI>according to its true Nature and Desert</HI> (as Dr.<HI>T.</HI> says it does) unless this be it's true Nature, that it is so bad, that even in the least Instance it perfectly swallows up all the Value of the Sinner's supposed good Deeds, let 'em be ever so many. So that this Matter is not left to our Metaphysicks, or Philosophy; the great Lawgiver, and infallible Judge of the Universe, has clearly decided it, in the Revelation he has made of what is agreeable to ex∣act Truth, Justice and the Nature of Things, in his re∣vealed Law or Rule of Righteousness.</P>
<P>He that in any Respect or Degree is a Transgressour of God's Law, is a wicked Man, yea, wholly Wicked in the Eye of the Law; all his Goodness being esteemed No∣thing, having no Account made of it, when taken together with his Wickedness. And therefore, without any regard to his Righteousness, he is, by the Sentence of the Law, and so by the Voice of Truth and Justice, to be treated as wor∣thy to be rejected, abhor'd and cursed forever; and must be so, unless Grace interposes, to cover his Transgression. But Men are really, in Themselves, what they are in the Eye of the Law, and by the Voice of strict Equity &amp; Justice; however they may be looked upon, and treated by infi∣nite and unmerited Mercy.</P>
<P>So that, on the whole, it appears, all Mankind have an infallibly effectual Propensity to that moral Evil, which
<PB N="32" REF="008118_0052_0F6B576ECD2CE8D8"/>
infinitely out-weighs the Value of all the Good that can be in them; and have such a Disposition of Heart, that the certain Consequence of it is, their being, in the Eye of perfect Truth and Righteousness, Wicked Men. And I leave all to judge, whether such a Disposition be not in the Eye of Truth a depraved Disposition.</P>
<P>Agreable to these Things, the Scripture represents all Mankind, not only as having Guilt, but immense Guilt, which they can have no Merit or Worthiness to counter∣vail. Such is the Representation we have in <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. 21, to the End. There, on <HI>Peter's</HI> enquiring <HI>how often his Brother should trespass against him and he for∣give him, whether until seven Times?</HI> Christ replies, <HI>I say not unto thee, until seven Times, but until seventy Times seven;</HI> apparently meaning, that he should esteem no Number of Offences too many, and no Degree of In∣jury it is possible our Neighbour should be guilty of towards us, too great to be forgiven. For which this Reason is given in the Parable there following, that if ever we obtain Forgiveness and Favour with God, He must pardon that Guilt and Injury towards his Majesty, which is immensely greater than the greatest Injuries that ever Men are guilty one towards another, yea, than the Sum of all their Injuries put together; let 'em be ever so many, and ever so great: so that the latter would be but as an hundred Pence to ten Thousand Talents: which immense Debt we owe to God, and have No∣thing to pay; which implies that we have no Merit, to countervail any Part of our Guilt. And this must be because, if all that may be called Virtue in us, be com∣pared with our Ill-desert, it is in the Sight of God as No∣thing to it. The Parable is not to represent <HI>Peter's</HI> Case in particular, but that of all who then were, or ever should be Christ's Disciples. It appears by the Conclusion of the Discourse; <HI>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do, if ye, from your Hearts, forgive not every one his Brother their Trespasses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="008118_0053_0F6B576F8DDA0158"/>Therefore how absurd must it be for Christians to ob∣ject, against the Depravity of Man's Nature, a greater Number of innocent and kind Actions, than of Crimes; and to talk of a prevailing Innocency, good Nature, In∣dustry, and Chearfulness of the greater Part of Mankind? Infinitely more absurd, than it would be to insist, that the Domestic of a Prince was not a bad Servant, because tho' sometimes he contemned and affronted his Master to a great Degree, yet he did not spit in his Master's Face so often as he performed Acts of Service; Or, than it would be to affirm, that his Spouse was a good Wife to him, be∣cause, altho' she committed Adultery, and that with the Slaves and Scoundrels sometimes, yet she did not do this so often as she did the Duties of a Wife. These Notions would be absurd, because the Crimes are too heinous to be atoned for, by many honest Actions of the Servant or Spouse of the Prince; there being a vast Disproportion between the Merit of the one, and the Ill-desert of the other; but in no Measure so great, nay infinitely less than that between the Demerit of our Offences against God, and the Value of our Acts of Obedience.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone through with my first Argument; having shewn the Evidence of the Truth of the Proposi∣tion I laid down at first, and proved it's Consequence. But there are many other things, that manifest a very corrupt Tendency or Disposition in Man's Nature in his present State, which I shall take Notice of in the follow∣ing <HI>Sections.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Depravity of Nature appears by a Propensity in all to sin immediately, as soon as they are capa∣ble of it, and to sin continually and progressively; and also by the Remains of Sin in the best of Men.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Depravity of Man's Nature appears, not only in that they universally commit Sin, who spend any long Time in the World, but in that Men are
<PB N="34" REF="008118_0054_0F6B5770809765D0"/>
naturally so prone to Sin, that none ever fail of <HI>immedi∣ately</HI> transgressing God's Law, and so of bringing infinite Guilt on themselves, and exposing themselves to eternal Perdition, as soon as they are capable of it.</P>
<P>The Scriptures are so very express in it, that all Man∣kind, <HI>all Flesh, all the World,</HI> every Man <HI>living,</HI> are guilty of Sin; that it must at least be understood, every one that is come to be capable of being active, in Duty to God, or Sin against him, is guilty of Sin. There are Multitudes in the World, who have but very lately begun to exert their Faculties, as moral Agents; and so are but just en∣tred on their State of Trial, as acting for themselves. There are many Thousands constantly in the World, who have not lived one Month, or Week, or Day, since they have arrived to any Period that can be assigned from their Birth to Twenty Years of Age. And if there be not a strong Propensity in Man's Nature to Sin, that should as it were hurry them on to speedy Transgression,&amp; they have no Guilt previous to their personal Sinning, what should hinder but that there might always be a greater Number of such as act for themselves on the Stage of the World, and are an∣swerable for themselves to God, who have hitherto kept them∣selves free from Sin, and have perfectly obeyed God's Law, and so are righteous in God's Sight with the Righteousness of the Law; and if they should be called out of the World with∣out any longer Trial (as innumerable die at all Periods of Life) would be justified by the Deeds of the Law? And how then can it be true, that <HI>in God's Sight no Man living can be justified,</HI> that <HI>no Man can be just with God,</HI> and that <HI>by the Deeds of the Law no Flesh can be justified, because by the Law is the Knowlege of Sin?</HI> And what should hinder but that there may always be many in the World, who are capable Subjects of Instructi∣on and Counsel, and of Prayer to God, for whom the Calls of God's Word to Repentance, and to seek Pardon thro' the Blood of Christ, and to forgive others their Injuries, because they need that God should forgive them, would not be proper; and for whom the Lord's Prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
<PB N="35" REF="008118_0055_0F6B5771CB7E0C10"/>
suitable, wherein Christ directs all his Followers to pray, that God would forgive their Sins, as they forgive those that trespass against them?</P>
<P>If there are any in the World, though but lately be∣come capable of acting for themselves, as Subjects of the Law of God, who are perfectly free from Sin, such are most likely to be found among the Children of Christian Parents, who give 'em the most pious Education, and set them the best Examples: And therefore such would ne∣ver be so likely to be found in any Part or Age of the World, as in the primitive Christian Church, in the first Age of Christianity (the Age of the Church's greatest Pu∣rity) so long after Christianity had been established, that there had been Time for great Numbers of Children to be born, and educated by those primitive Christians. It was in that Age, and in such a Part of that Age, that the Apostle <HI>John</HI> wrote his first Epistle to the Christians that then were. But if there was then a Number of them, come to Understanding, who were perfectly free from Sin, why does he write as he does? 1 Joh. 1. 8, 9, 10. <HI>If we say that we have no Sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us. If we confess our Sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanse us from all Unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sin∣ned, we make him a Liar, and the Truth is not in us.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If any should object, that this is an overstraining of Things; and that it supposes a greater Niceness and Exactness, than is observed in Scripture-Representations and Expressions, to infer from these Expressions, that all Men sin immediately, as soon as ever they are capable of it: To this I would say, that I think the Arguments used are truly solid, and do really and justly conclude, either that Men are born guilty, and so are chargeable with Sin before they come to act for themselves, or else commit Sin immediately, without the least Time intermitting, after they are capable of under∣standing their Obligations to God, and reflecting on them∣selves; and that the Scripture clearly determines, there is not one such Person in the World, free from Sin. But whether this be a straining things up to too great an Exact∣ness, or not; yet I suppose, None that don't entirely set aside the Sense of such Scriptures as have been mentioned, and deny those Propositions which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself allows to be contain'd in some of 'em will deny they prove, that no <HI>considerable Time</HI> passes after Men are capable of acting for themselves, as the Subjects of God's Law, before they are guilty of Sin; because if the Time were considerable, it would be great enough to deserve to be taken Notice of, as an Exception to such universal Propositions, as, <HI>In thy Sight shall no Man living be justified,</HI> &amp;c. And if this be allowed, that Men are so prone to Sin, that in Fact all Mankind do sin, <HI>as it were,</HI> immediately, after they come to be capable of it, or fail not to sin so soon, that <HI>no considerable Time</HI> passes before they run into Transgression against God; It don't much alter the Case, as to the present Argument. If the Time of Freedom from Sin to be so small, as not to be worthy of Notice in the forementioned universal Propositions of Scrip∣ture, it is also so small, as not to be worthy of Noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the present Argument.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="008118_0056_0F6B5772D0F46888"/>Again, the Reality and Greatness of the Depravity of Man's Nature appears in this, That he has a prevailing Propensity to be <HI>continually</HI> sinning against God. What has been observed above, will clearly prove this. That same Disposition of Nature, which is an effectual Propen∣sity to <HI>immediate</HI> Sin amounts to a Propensity to <HI>conti∣nual</HI> Sin. For a being prone to <HI>continual</HI> sinning is no∣thing but a Proneness to immediate Sin <HI>continued.</HI> Such appears to be the Tendency of Nature to Sin, that as soon as ever Man is capable, it causes him immediately to sin, without suffering any considerable Time to pass without Sin. And therefore, if the same Propensity be continued undi∣minish'd, there will be an equal Tendency to immediate sinning again, without any considerable Time passing. And so the same will always be a Disposition still imme∣diately to sin, with as little Time passing without Sin af∣terwards, as at first. The only Reason that can be given why Sinning must be immediate at first, is that the Dispo∣sition
<PB N="37" REF="008118_0057_0F6B5773E83F40D0"/>
is so great, that it will not suffer any considerable Time to pass without Sin: and therefore, the same Dis∣position being continued in equal Degree, without some new Restraint, or contrary Tendency, it will still equally tend to the same Effect. And tho' it is true, the Pro∣pensity may be diminished, or have Restraints laid upon it, by gracious Disposals of Providence, or merciful In∣fluences of God's Spirit; yet this is not owing to Nature. That strong Propensity of Nature, by which Men are so prone to immediate Sinning at first, has no Tendency in it self to a Diminution; but rather to an <HI>Increase;</HI> as the continued Exercise of an evil Disposition, in repeated actual Sins, tends to strengthen it more &amp; more: agreea∣ble to that Observation of Dr. <HI>T—r's,</HI> p. 228. <Q>We are apt to be drawn into Sin by bodily Appetites, and when once we are under the Government of these Ap∣petites, it is at least exceeding difficult, if not impracti∣cable, to recover our selves, by the meer Force of Reason.</Q> The Increase of Strength of Disposition in such a Case, is as in a falling Body, the Strength of it's Tendency to descend is continually increased, so long as it's Motion is continued. Not only a constant Commissi∣on of Sin, but a constant Increase in the Habits &amp; Practice of Wickedness, is the true Tendency of Man's depraved Nature, if unrestrained by divine Grace; as the true Tendency of the Nature of an heavy Body, if Obstacles are removed, is not only to fall with a continual Motion, but with a constantly increasing Motion. And we see, that increasing Iniquity is actually the Consequence of natural Depravity, in most Men, notwithstanding all the Restraints they have. Dispositions to Evil are commonly much stronger in adult Persons, than in Children, when they first begin to act in the World as rational Creatures.</P>
<P>If Sin be such a Thing as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself represents it, P. 69. <Q>A Thing of an odious and destructive Nature, the Corruption and Ruin of our Nature, and infinitely hateful to God;</Q> then such a Propensity to continual and increasing Sin, must be a very evil Dis∣position.
<PB N="38" REF="008118_0058_0F6B5774031AEC00"/>
And if we may judge of the Perniciousness of an Inclination of Nature, by the Evil of the Effect it naturally tends to, the Propensity of Man's Nature must be evil indeed: For the Soul being immortal, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> acknowleges, P. 370. it will follow from what has been observed above, that Man has a natural Disposition to one of these two Things; either to an Increase of Wicked∣ness without End, or 'till Wickedness comes to be so great, that the Capacity of his Nature will not allow it to be greater. This being what his Wickedness will come to by it's natural Tendency, if divine Grace don't pre∣vent, it may as truly be said to be the Effect which Man's Natural Corruption tends to, as that an Acorn in a proper Soil truly tends by it's Nature to become a great Tree.</P>
<P>Again, That Sin which is remaining in the Hearts of the <HI>best</HI> Men on Earth, makes it evident, that Man's Na∣ture is corrupt, as he comes into the World. A remain∣ing Depravity of Heart in the greatest Saints, may be ar∣gued from the Sins of most of those who are set forth in Scripture as the most eminent Instances and Examples of Virtue and Piety: And is also manifest from this, That the Scripture represents all God's Children as standing in Need of Chastisement. Heb. xii. 6, 7, 8. <HI>For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth; and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.—What Son is he, whom the Father chastneth not?—If ye are without Chastisement,—then, are ye Bastards, and not Sons.</HI> But this is directly and fully asserted in some Places; as in that foremention'd Eccles. vii. 20. <HI>There is not a just Man upon Earth, that doeth Good and sinneth not.</HI> Which is as much as to say, There is no Man on Earth, that is so just, as to have attain'd to such a Degree of Righteousness, as not to commit any Sin. Yea, the Apostle speaks of all Christians as often sinning, or committing many Sins; even in that primitive Age of the Christian Church, an Age distinguished from all others by eminent Attainments in Holiness; Jam. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>In many Things we all offend.</HI> And that there is Pollu∣tion in the Hearts of all, as the Remainder of moral Filth
<PB N="39" REF="008118_0059_0F6B5774C1F7D860"/>
that was there antecedent to all Attempts or Means forPu∣rification, is very plainly declared in Prov. xx. 9. <HI>Who can say, I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</HI></P>
<P>According to Dr. <HI>T.</HI> Men come into the World wholly free from sinful Propensities. And if so, it appears from what has been already said, there would be Nothing to hinder, but that many, without being better than they are by Nature, might perfectly avoid the Commission of Sin. But much more might this be the Case with Men after they had, by Care, Diligence and good Practice, attain'd those positive Habits of Virtue, where by they are at a much great∣er Distance from Sin, than they were naturally:—which this Writer supposes to be the Case with many good Men. But since the Scripture teaches us, that the best Men in the World do often commit Sin, and have remaining Pollution of Heart, this makes it abundantly evident, that Men, when they are no otherwise than they were by Na∣ture, without any of those virtuous Attainments, have a sinful Depravity; yea, must have great Corruption of Na∣ture.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Depravity of Nature appears, in that the gene∣ralConsequence of the State &amp; Tendency of Man's Nature is a much greater Degree of Sin, than Righteousness; not only with respect to Value and Demerit, but Matter and Quantity.</HEAD>
<P>I Have before shewn, that there is a Propensity in Man's Nature to that Sin, which in Heinousness and Ill-desert immensely outweighs all the Value and Merit of any supposed Good, that may be in him, or that he can do. I now proceed to say further, that such is Man's Nature, in his present State, that it tends to this lamentable Effect, That there should at all Times, thro'
<PB N="40" REF="008118_0060_0F6B577624A2C4D8"/>
the Course of his Life, be at least, much more Sin, than Righteousness; not only as to <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> but as to <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Measure;</HI> more Disagreement of Heart and Practice from the Law of God, and from the Law of Nature and Reason, than Agreement and Conformity.</P>
<P>The Law of God is the Rule of Right, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> often calls it: It is the Measure of Virtue and Sin: So much Agreement as there is with this Rule, so much is there of Rectitude, Righteousness, or true Virtue, and no more; and so much Disagreement as there is with this Rule, so much Sin is there.</P>
<P>Having premised this, the following Things may be here observed.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Degree of Disagreement from this Rule of Right is to be determined, not only by the Degree of Distance from it in <HI>Excess,</HI> but also in <HI>Defect;</HI> or in other Words, not only in positive Transgression, or doing what is <HI>forbidden,</HI> but also in witholding what is <HI>required.</HI> The divine Lawgiver does as much prohibit the one as the other, and does as much charge the latter as a sinful Breach of his Law, exposing to his eternal Wrath and Curse, as the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mer. Thus at the Day of Judgment, as described <HI>Matth.</HI> xxv. The Wicked are condemn'd, as <HI>cursed,</HI> to <HI>everlasting Fire,</HI> for their Sin in Defect and Omission: <HI>I was on hungred, and ye gave me no Meat,</HI> &amp;c. And the Case is thus, not only when the Defect is in Word or Behaviour, but in the inward Temper and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xercise of the Mind. 1 Cor. xvi. 22. <HI>If any Man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</HI> Dr.<HI>T.</HI> speaking of the Sentence and Punishment of the Wicked (<HI>Matth.</HI>xxv.41, 46.) says, <Q>It was manifestly for WANT of Benevolence, Love and Compassion to their Fellow∣Creatures, that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondemned.</Q> And else∣where, as was observed before, he says, that the Law of God extends to the <HI>latent Principles</HI> of Sin, to <HI>forbid</HI> them, and to condemn to eternal Destruction for them. And if so, it doubtless also extends to the inward Principles of Holiness to <HI>require</HI> them, and in like manner to cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> for the Want of them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="41" REF="008118_0061_0F6B5776C9EA5C50"/>II. The Sum of our Duty to God, required in his Law, is <HI>Love to God;</HI> taking Love in a large Sense, for the true Regard of our Hearts to God, implying Esteem, Honour, Benevolence, Gratitude, Complacence &amp;c. This is not only very plain by the Scripture, but it is e∣vident in it self. The Sum of what the Law of God re∣quires, is doubtless Obedience to that Law: No Law can require more than that it be obeyed. But 'tis manifest, that Obedience to God is Nothing, any otherwise than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Testimony of the Respect of our Hearts to God: With∣out the Heart, Man's external Acts are no more than the Motions of the Limbs of a wooden Image; have no more of the Nature of either Sin or Righteousness. It must therefore needs be so, that Love to God, or the Respect of the Heart, must be the Sum of the Duty required to∣wards God in his Law.</P>
<P N="3">III. It therefore appears from the Premises, that who∣soever withholds more of that Love or Respect of Heart from God which his Law requires, than he affords, has more Sin, than Righteousness. Not only he that has left divine Love, than Passions &amp; Affections which are opposite; but also he that don't love God half so much as he ought, or has Reason to do, has justly more Wrong, than Right, imputed to him, according to the Law of God, and the Law of Reason; he has more Irregularity, than Recti∣tude, with Regard to the Law of Love. The sinful Dis∣respect or Unrespectfulness of his Heart to God, is greater than his Respect to him.</P>
<P>But what considerate Person is there, even among the more virtuous Part of Mankind, but what would be a∣shamed to say, and profess before God or Men, that he loves God half so much as he ought to do; or that he exercises one half of that Esteem, Honour and Gratitude towards God, which would be altogether becoming Him; considering what God is, and what great Manifestations he has made of his transcendent Excellency and Good∣ness, and what Benefits he receives from him? And if few or none of the best of Men can with Reason and
<PB N="42" REF="008118_0062_0F6B5777021324A8"/>
Truth make even such a Profession, how far from it must the Generality of Mankind be?</P>
<P>The chief and most fundamental of all the Commands of the moral Law, requires us <HI>to love the Lord our God, with all our Hearts, and with all our Souls, with all our Strength, and all our Mind:</HI> that is plainly, with all that is within us, or to the utmost Capacity of our Na∣ture: all that belongs it, or is comprehended <HI>within</HI> the utmost Extent or Capacity of our Heart and Soul, and Mind and Strength, is required. God is in Himself wor∣thy of infinitely greater Love, than any Creature can ex∣ercise towards him: He is worthy of Love equal to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fections, which are infinite: God loves Himself with no greater Love than he is worthy of, when he loves him∣self infinitely: But we can give God no more than we have. Therefore, if we give him so much, if we love him to the utmost Extent of the Faculties of our Nature, we are exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed: But when what is proposed, is only that we should love him as much as our Capacity will allow, this Excuse of Want of Capacity ceases, and Obligation takes hold of us; and we are doubtless obliged to love God to the utmost of what is possible for us, with such Faculties, and such Opportunities and Advantages to know God, as we have. And 'tis evidently implied in this great Commandment of the Law, that our Love to God should be so great, as to have the most absolute Possession of all the Soul, and the perfect Government of all the Princi∣ples and Springs of Action that are in our Nature.</P>
<P>Tho' it is not easy, precisely to fix the Limits of Man's Capacity, as to Love to God; yet in general we may determine, that his Capacity of Love is coextended with his Capacity of Knowledge: The Exercise of the Un∣derstanding opens the Way for the Exercise of the other Faculty. Now, tho' we can't have any proper positive Understanding of God's infinite Excellency; yet the Ca∣pacity of the human Understanding is very great, and may be extended far. 'Tis needless to dispute, how far Man's Knowledge may be said to be strictly comprehensive
<PB N="43" REF="008118_0063_0F6B5777CD55ECD8"/>
of Things that are very great, as of the Extent of the Expanse of the Heavens, or of the Dimensions of the Globe of the Earth; and of such a great Number, as of the many Millions of it's Inhabitants. The Word, <HI>Com∣prehensive,</HI> seems to be ambiguous. But doubtless we are capable of some proper positive Understanding of the Greatness of these Things, in Comparison of other Things that we know, as unspeakably exceeding them. We are capable of some clear Understanding of the Greatness or Considerableness of a whole Nation, or of the whole World of Mankind, as vastly exceeding that of a parti∣cular Person or Family. We can positively understand, that the whole Globe of the Earth is vastly greater, than a particular Hill or Mountain. And can have some good positive Apprehension of the starry Heavens, as so great∣ly exceeding the Globe of the Earth, that the latter is as it were Nothing to it. So the human Faculties are capable of a real and clear Understanding of the Great∣ness, Glory and Goodness of God, &amp; of our Dependence upon him, from the Manifestations which God has made of himself to Mankind, as being beyond all Expression above that of the most excellent human Friend, or earth∣ly Object. And so we are capable of an Esteem and Love to God, which shall be proportionable, and as much exceeding that which we have to any Creature.</P>
<P>These things may help us to form some Judgment, how vastly the Generality of Mankind fall below their Duty, with respect to Love to God; yea, how far they are from coming half-way to that Height of Love, which is agre∣able to the Rule of Right. Surely if our Esteem of God, Desires after him, and Delight in him were such as become us, considering the Things foremention'd, they would exceed our Regard to other Things, as the Hea∣vens are high above the Earth, and would swallow up all other Affections, like a Deluge. But how far, how ex∣ceeding far, are the Generality of the World from any Ap∣pearance of being influenced and governed by such a Degree of divine Love as this!</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="008118_0064_0F6B5778842CD130"/>If we consider the Love of God with respect to that one Kind of Exercise of it, namely, <HI>Gratitude,</HI> how far indeed do the Generality of Mankind come short of the Rule of Right and Reason in this! If we consider how various, innumerable and vast the Benefits are we receive from God, and how infinitely great and wonderful that Grace of his is, which is revealed and offered to them that live under the Gospel, in that eternal Salvation which is procured by God's giving his only begotten Son to die for Sinners; and also how unworthy we are all, deserving (as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> confesses) eternal Perdition under God's Wrath and Curse, how great is the Gratitude, that would be∣come us, who are the Subjects of so many and great Be∣nef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and have such Grace towards poor sinful lost Man∣kind set before us in so affecting a Manner, as in the ex∣treme Sufferings of the Son of God, being carried thro' those Pains by a Love stronger than Death, a Love that conquered those mighty Agonies a Love whose Length and Breadth and Depth and Height passes Knowledge? But oh, what poor Returns—! How little the Gra∣tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de! How low, how cold and inconstant the Affection is the best, compared with the Obligation! And what then shall be said of the Gratitude of the Generality? Or rather, who can express the Ingratitude?</P>
<P>If it were so, that the greater Part of them that are called, Christians, were no Enemies to Christ in Heart and Practice, were not governed by Principles opposite to him and his Gospel, but had some real Love and Gratitude; yet if their Love falls vastly short of the Obligation or Occasion given, they are guilty of shameful and odious Ingratitude. As, when a Man has been the Subject of some Instance of transcendent Generosity, whereby he has been reliev'd from the most extreme Calamity, and brought into very opulent, honourable and happy Cir∣cumstances, by a Benefactor, of excellent Character; and yet expresses no more Gratitude on such an Occasion, than would be requisite for some Kindness comparatively in∣finitely small, he may justly fall under the Imputation of
<PB N="45" REF="008118_0065_0F6B57799F10BE58"/>
vile Unthankfulness, and of much more Ingratitude, than Gratitude; tho' he may have no Ill-Will to his Bene∣factor, or no positive Affection of Mind contrary to Thankfulness and Benevolence: What is odious in him is his Defect, whereby he falls so vastly below his Duty.</P>
<P>Dr.<HI>Turnbull</HI> abundantly insists, that the Forces of the Affections naturally in Man are well proportioned; and often puts a Question to this Purpose,—How Man's Na∣ture could have been better constituted in this respect? How the Affections of his Heart could have been better proportioned?—I will now mention one Instance, out of many that might be mentioned. Man, if his Heart were not depraved, might have had a Disposition to <HI>Gratitude to God for his Goodness,</HI> in Proportion to his Disposition to <HI>Anger towards Men for their Injuries.</HI> When I say, in Proportion, I mean considering the Greatness and Num∣ber of Favours and Injuries, and the Degree in which the one and the other are unmerited, and the Benefit received by the former, and the Damage sustained by the latter. Is there not an apparent and vast Difference and Inequa∣lity in the Dispositions to these two Kinds of Affection, in the Generality of both old and young, adult Persons and little Children? How ready is Resentment for Injuries received from Men? and how easily is it raised in most, at best, to an Equality with the Desert? And is it so with respect to Gratitude for Benefits received from God, in any Degree of Comparison? Dr.<HI>Turnbull</HI> pleads for the natural Disposition to Anger for Injuries, as being good and useful: But surely Gratitude to God, if we were inclined to it, would be at least as good and useful as the other.</P>
<P>How far the Generality of Mankind are from their Duty with respect to Love to God, will further appear, if we consider, that we are obliged not only to love him with a Love of Gratitude for Benefits received; but true Love to God primarily consists in a supreme Regard to him for what he is in himself. The Tendency of true Virtue is to treat every thing as it is, and according to it's Nature.
<PB N="46" REF="008118_0066_0F6B577A11FD7BE8"/>
And if we regard the most High according to the infinite Dignity and Glory of his Nature, we shall esteem and love him with all our Heart and Soul, and to the utmost of the Capacity of our Nature, on this Account; and not primarily because he has promoted our Interest. If God be infinitely excellent in Himself, then He is infinitely lovely on that Account; or in other Words, infinitely worthy to be loved. And doubtless, if he be worthy to be loved for this, then he ought to be loved for this. And 'tis manifest, there can be no true Love to Him, if he be not loved for what he is in himself. For if we love him not for his own Sake, but for something else, then our Love is not terminated on him, but on something else, as it's ultimate Object. That is no true Value for infinite Worth, which implies no Value for that Worthiness in itself considered, but only on the Account of something foreign. Our Esteem of God is fundamentally defective, if it be not primarily for the Excellency of his Nature, which is the Foundation of all that is valuable in him in any Re∣spect. If we love not God because he is what he is, but only because he is profitable to us, in Truth we love him not at all: If we seem to love him, our Love is not to him, but to something else.</P>
<P>And now I must leave it to every one to judge for himself, from his own Opportunities of Observation and Information concerning Mankind, how little there is of this disinterested Love to God, this pure divine Affection, in the World. How very little indeed in Comparison of other Affections altogether diverse, which perpetually urge, actuate and govern Mankind, and keep the World, through all Nations and Ages, in a con∣tinual Agitation and Commotion! This is an Evidence of an horrid Contempt of God, reigning in the World of Man∣kind. It would be justly esteemed a great Instance of Disrespect and Contempt of a Prince, if one of his Sub∣jects, when he came in to his House, should set him below his meanest Slave. But in setting the infinite JEHO∣VAH below earthly Objects and Enjoyments, Men de∣grade
<PB N="47" REF="008118_0067_0F6B577AD35F1B40"/>
him below those Things, between which and him there is an infinitely greater Distance, then between the highest earthly Potentate and the most abject of Mortals. Such a Conduct as the Generality of Men are guilty of towards God, continually and thro' all Ages, in innume∣rable Respects, would be accounted the most vile contemp∣tuous Treatment of a Fellow-Creature, of distinguish'd Dig∣nity. Particularly Men's Treatment of the Offers God makes of Himself to them as their Friend, their Father, their God and everlasting Portion; their Treatment of the Exhibi∣tions he has made of his unmeasurable Love, and the boundless Riches of his Grace in Christ, attended with earnest repeated Calls, Counsels, Expostulations, and In∣treaties; as also of the most dreadful Threatnings of his eternal Displeasure and Vengeance.</P>
<P>Before I finish this <HI>Section,</HI> it may be proper to say something in Reply to an Objection,—some may be ready to make against the Force of that Argument, which has been used to prove, that Men in general have more Sin than Righteousness, namely, That they don't come half way to that Degree of Love to God, which becomes them, and is their Duty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Objection</HI> is this: That the Argument seems to prove too much, in that it will prove, that even good Men themselves have more Sin than Holiness; which also has been supposed. But if this were true, it would follow, that Sin is the prevalent Principle even in good Men, and that it is the Principle which has the Predo∣minancy in the Heart and Practice of the truly pious; which is plainly contrary to the Word of God.</P>
<P>I answer; If it be indeed so, that there is more Sin, consisting in Defect of required Holiness, than there is of Holiness in good Men in this World; yet it will not follow, that Sin has the chief Government of their Heart and Practice; for two Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. They may love God more than other Things, and yet there may not be so much Love, as there is Want of due Love; or in other Words, they may love God more
<PB N="48" REF="008118_0068_0F6B577B82102708"/>
than the World, and therefore the Love of God may be predominant, and yet may not love God near half so much as they ought to do. This need not be esteemed a Para∣dox: A Person may love a Father, or some great Friend and Benefactor, of a very excellent Character, more than some other Object, a thousand Times less worthy of his Esteem and Affection, and yet love him ten Times less than he ought; and so be chargeable, all Things consi∣dered, with a Deficiency in Respect and Gratitude, that is very unbecoming and hateful. If Love to God prevails above the Love of other Things, then Virtue will prevail above evil Affections, or positive Principles of Sin; by which Principles it is, that Sin has a positive Power and Influence. For evil Affections radically consist in inor∣dinate Love to other Things besides God. And there∣fore, Virtue prevailing beyond these, will have the go∣verning Influence. The Predominance of the Love of God in the Hearts of good Men is more from the Nature of the Object loved, and the Nature of the Principle of true Love, than the Degree of the Principle. The Object is One of supreme Loveliness; immensely above all other Objects in Worthiness of Regard; And 'tis by such a transcendent Excellency, that he is God, and worthy to be regarded and adored as God: And he that truly loves God, loves him as God: True Love acknowledges him to be God, or to be divinely and su∣premely Excellent; And must arise from some Know∣ledge, Sense and Conviction of his Worthiness of su∣preme Respect: And tho' the Sense and View of it may be very imperfect, and the Love that arises from it in like Manner imperfect; Yet if there be any realising View of such divine Excellency, it must cause the Heart to respect God above all.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Reason, why a Principle of Holiness main∣tains the Dominion in the Hearts of good Men, is the Na∣ture of the Covenant of Grace, and the Promises of that Covenant, on which true Christian Virtue relies, and which engage God's Strength and Assistance to be on it's
<PB N="49" REF="008118_0069_0F6B577E2719A4C0"/>
Side, and to help it against it's Enemy, that it may not be overcome. The Just live by Faith. Holiness in the Christian, or his spiritual Life, is maintain'd, as it has Res∣pect by Faith to it's Author and Finisher, and derives Strength and Efficacy from the divine Fountain, and by this Means overcomes. For, as the Apostle says, <HI>This is the Victory that overcomes the World, even our Faith.</HI> 'Tis our Faith in him who has promised, never to leave nor forsake his People, and not to forsake the Work of his own Hands, nor suffer his People to be tempted above their Ability, and that his Grace shall be sufficient for them, and that his Strength shall be made perfect in Weak∣ness, and that where he has begun a good Work he will carry it on to the Day of Christ.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Corruption of Man's Nature appears by it's Tendency, in it's present State, to an extreme Degree of Folly and Stupidity in Matters of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears, that Man's Nature is greatly depraved, by an apparent Proneness to an exceeding <HI>Stupidity</HI> and Sot∣tishness in those Things wherein his Duty and main In∣terest are chiefly concerned.</P>
<P>I shall instance in two Things; <HI>viz.</HI> Men's Proneness to <HI>Idolatry;</HI> and so general and great a <HI>Disregard of eternal Things,</HI> as appears in them that live under the Light of the Gospel.</P>
<P>'Tis manifest, that Man's Nature in it's present State is attended with a great Propensity to forsake the Acknow∣ledgment and Worship of the true God, and to fall into the most stupid <HI>Idolatry.</HI> This has been sufficiently proved by known Fact, on abundant Trial: Inasmuch as the World of Mankind in general (excepting one small People, miraculouslly delivered and preserved) through
<PB N="50" REF="008118_0070_0F6B577F3B6FC648"/>
all Nations, in all Parts of the World, Ages after Ages, continued without the Knowledge and Worship of the true God, and overwhelmed in gross Idolatry, without the least Appearance or Prospect of it's recovering it self from so great Blindness, or returning from it's brutish Principles and Customs, 'till delivered by divine Grace.</P>
<P>In Order to the most just arguing from Fact, concern∣ing the Tendency of Man's Nature, as that is in it self, it should be enquired what the Event has been, where Na∣ture has been left to it self, to operate according to it's own Tendency, with least Opposition made to it by any thing supernatural; rather than in exempt Places, where the infinite Power and Grace of God have interposed, and extraordinary Means have been used to stem the Current, and bring Men to true Religion and Virtue. As to the Means by which God's People of old, in the Line of <HI>Abraham,</HI> were delivered and preserved from Idolatry, they were miraculous, and of meer Grace: Notwithstand∣ing which, they were often relapsing into the Notions and Ways of the Heathen: and when they had backslidden, never were recovered, but by divine gracious Interpositi∣on. And as to the Means by which many Gentile Na∣tions have been delivered, since the Days of the Gospel, they are such as have been wholly owing to most won∣derful, miraculous and infinite Grace. God was under no Obligation to bestow on the heathen World greater Advantages than they had in the Ages of their gross Darkness; as appears by the Fact, that God actually did not, for so long a Time, bestow greater Advantages.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself observes (<HI>Key</HI> P. 1.) <HI>That in about</HI> 400 <HI>Years after the Flood, the Generality of Mankind were fallen into Idolatry.</HI> And thus it was every where through the World, excepting among that People that was saved, and preserved by a constant Series of Miracles, through a Variety of Countries, Nations and Climates, <HI>great enough,</HI>—and thro' successive Changes, Revolutions and Ages <HI>numerous enough,</HI> to be a sufficient Trial of what Mankind are prone to; if there be any such thing as a sufficient Trial.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="008118_0071_0F6B577F56F964B8"/>That Men should forsake the true God for Idols, in an Evidence of the most astonishing Folly and Stupidity, by God's own Testimony. Jer. ii. 13. <HI>Be astonished, O ye Heavens, at this, and be ye horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord: For my People have committed two Evils; They have forsaken me the Fountain of living Waters, and have hewed out to themselves Cisterns, broken Cisterns, that can hold no Water.</HI> And that Mankind in general did thus, so soon after the Flood, was from the evil Propensity of their Hearts, and <HI>because they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge;</HI> as is evident by <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 28.—And the Universality of the Effect shews that the Cause was universal, and not any Thing belonging to the particular Circumstances of one, or only some Nations or Ages, but something belonging to that Nature that is common to all Nations, and that remains the same thro' all Ages. And what other Cause could this great Effect possibly arise from, but a depraved Disposition, natural to all Mankind? It could not arise from Want of a sufficient Capacity or Means of Know∣ledge. This is in Effect confessed on all Hands. Dr. <HI>Turnbull,</HI> (<HI>Chris. Phil.</HI> P. 21.) says as follows; <Q>The Existence of one infinitely powerful, wise and good Mind, the Author, Creator, Upholder and Governour of all Things, is a Truth that lies plain and obvious to all that will but think.</Q> And (Ibid. P. 245.) <Q>Moral Knowledge, which is the most important of all Knowledge, may easily be acquired by all Men.</Q> And again, (Ibid. P. 292.) <Q>Every Man by himself, if he would duly employ his Mind, in the Contemplation of the Works of God about him, or in the Examination of his own Frame,—might make very great Pro∣gress in the Knowledge of the Wisdom and Goodness of God. This all Men, generally speaking, might do, with very little Assistance; for they have all sufficient Abilities for thus employing their Minds, and have all sufficient Time for it.</Q> Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> says, (<HI>Hum. Und.</HI> B. IV. Chap. iv. P. 242. Edit. 11.) <Q>Our own Ex∣istence,
<PB N="52" REF="008118_0072_0F6B5780047D6618"/>
and the sensible Parts of the Universe, offer the Proofs of a Deity so clearly and cogently to our Thoughts, that I deem it impossible for a considerate Man to withstand them. For I judge it as certain and clear a Truth, as can any where be delivered, that the invisible Things of God are clearly seen from the Creation of the World, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</Q> And Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself, (in P. 78.) says, <Q>The Light given to all Ages and Nations of the World, is sufficient for the Knowledge and Practice of their Duty.</Q> And in P. 111, 112. citing those Words of the Apostle, Rom. ii. 14, 15, says, <Q>This clearly supposes that the Gen∣tiles, who were then in the World, might have done the Things contained in the Law by Nature, or their natural Power.</Q> And in one of the next Sentences, he says, <Q>The Apostle in Rom. i. 19, 20, 21. affirms that the Gentiles had Light sufficient to have seen God's eternal Power and Godhead, in the Works of Creation; and that the Reason why they did not glo∣rify him as God, was because they became vain in their Imaginations, and had darken'd their foolish Heart; so that they were without Excuse.</Q> And in his Para∣phrase on those Verses in the 1st of Rom. he speaks of the <Q>very Heathens, that were without a written Revela∣tion, as having that clear and evident Discovery of God's Being and Perfections, that they are inexcusable in not glorifying him, suitably to his excellent Nature, and as the Author of their Being and Enjoyments.</Q> And in P. 422, he says, <Q>God affords every Man suf∣ficient Light to know his Duty.</Q> If all Ages and Nations of the World have sufficient Light for the Know∣ledge of God, and their Duty to him, then even such Nations and Ages, in which the most brutish Ignorance and Barbarity prevailed, had sufficient Light, if they had had but a Disposition to improve it; and then much more those of the Heathen, which were more knowing and polish'd, and in Ages wherein Arts and Learning had made
<PB N="53" REF="008118_0073_0F6B5780D70C40D8"/>
greatest Advances. But even in such Nations and Ages▪ there was no Advance made towards true Religion; as Dr. <HI>Winder</HI> observes, (<HI>Hist. of Knowl.</HI> Vol. II. P. 336.) in the following Words; <Q>The Pagan Religion degene∣rated into greater Absurdity, the further it proceeded; and it prevailed in all it's Height of Absurdity, when the Pagan Nations were polished to the Height. Tho' they set out with the Talents of Reason, and had solid Foundations of Information to build upon, it in Fact proved, that with all their strengthen'd Faculties, and growing Powers of Reason, the Edifice of Religion rose in the most absurd Deformities and Disproportions, and gradually went on in the most irrational, disproportion'd, incongruous Systems, of which the most easy Dictates of Reason would have demonstrated the Absurdity. They were contrary to all just Calculations in moral Mathematicks.</Q> He observes, <Q>That their grossest Abominations first began in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where was an Ostentation of the greatest Progress in Learning and Science: and they never renounced clearly any of their Abominations, or openly returned to the Worship of the one true God, the Creator of all things, and to the original, genuine Sentiments of the highest, and most venerable Antiquity. The Pagan Religion con∣tinued in this deep State of Corruption to the last. The Pagan Philosophers, and inquisitive Men, made great Improvements in many Sciences, and even in Morality it self; yet the inveterate Absurdities of Pa∣gan Idolatry, remain'd without Remedy. Every Tem∣ple smoked with Incense to the Sun and Moon, &amp; other inanimate, material Luminaries, and earthly Elements, to Jupiter, Juno, Mars and Venus, &amp;c. the Patrons and Examples of almost every Vice. Hecatombs bled on the Altars of a Thousand Gods; as mad Superstition inspired. And this was not the Disgrace of our igno∣rant, untaught Northern Countries only; but even at <HI>Athens</HI> itself, the Infamy reigned, and circulated thro' all Greece: And finally prevailed, amidst all their

Learning &amp; Politeness, under the <HI>Ptol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my's</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sars</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> Now if the Knowledge of the Pagan World, in Religion, proceeded no further than this; if they retain'd all their Deities, even the most absurd of them all, their deified Beasts, and de∣ified Men, even to the last Breath of Pagan Power; We may justly ascribe the great Improvements in the World on the Subject of Religion, to divine Revelati∣on; either vouchsafed in the Beginning, when this Knowledge was competently clear and copious; or at the Death of Paganism, when this Light shone forth in it's consumate Lustre, at the Coming of Christ.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> often speaks of the Idolatry of the Heathen World, as <HI>great Wickedness,</HI> in which they were wholly inexcusable: and yet often speaks of their Case as re∣mediless, as being dead in Sin, and unable to recover themselves. And if so, and yet, according to his own Doc∣trine▪ every Age, and every Nation, and every Man, had sufficient Light afforded, to know God, and to know and do their whole Duty to him; then their Inability to de∣liver themselves must be a moral Inability, consisting in a desperate Depravity, and most evil Disposition of Heart.</P>
<P>And if there had not been sufficient Trial of the Pro∣pensity of the Hearts of Mankind, thro' all those Ages that pass'd from <HI>Abraham</HI> to Christ, the Trial has been continued down to this Day, in all those vast Regions of the Face of the Earth, that have remain'd without any Effects of the Light of the Gospel; and the dismal Effect continues every where unvaried. How was it with that Multitude of Nations inhabiting <HI>South &amp; North America?</HI> What Appearance was there, when the <HI>Europeans</HI> first came hither, of their being recovered, or recovering, in any Degree from the grossest Ignorance, Delusions, and most stupid Paganism? And how is it at this Day, in those Parts of Africa and Asia, into which the Light of the Gospel has not penetrated?</P>
<P>This strong and universally prevalent Disposition of Mankind to Idolatry, of which there has been such great
<PB N="55" REF="008118_0075_0F6B57825CE5F300"/>
Trial, and so notorious and vast Proof, in Fact, is a most glaring Evidence of the exceeding Depravity of the hu∣man Nature; as 'tis a Propensity, in the utmost Degree, contrary to the highest End, the main Business, and chief Happiness of Mankind, consisting in the Knowledge, Ser∣vice and Enjoyment of the living God, the Creator and Governour of the World;—in the highest Degree con∣trary to that for which mainly God gave Mankind more Understanding than the Beasts of the Earth, and made them wiser than the Fowls of Heaven; which was, that they might be capable of the Knowledge of God;—And in the highest Degree contrary to the first and greatest Com∣mandment of the moral Law, That <HI>we should have no other Gods before JEHOVAH,</HI> and that we should love and adore him with all our Heart, Soul, Mind and Strength. The Scriptures are abundant in representing the Idolatry of the Heathen World as their exceeding Wickedness, and their most brutish Stupidity. They that worship and trust in Idols, are said themselves to be like the lifeless Statues they worship, like meer senseless Stocks and Stones, Psal. exv. 4—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and cxxxv. 15—18.</P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Instance of the natural <HI>Stupidity</HI> of the Minds of Mankind, that I shall observe, is that great <HI>Disre∣gard of their own eternal Interest;</HI> which appears so remar∣kably, so generally, among them that live under the Gospel.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> observes, (<HI>Hum. Und.</HI> Vol. I. P. 207.) <Q>Were the Will determined by the Views of Good, as it appears in Contemplation, greater or less to the Un∣derstanding, it could never get loose from the infinite eternal Joys of Heaven, once proposed, and considered as possible; the eternal Condition of a future State infinitely out weighing the Expectation of Riches or Honour, or any other worldly Pleasure, which we can propose to our selves; tho' we should grant these the more probable to be obtained.</Q> Again (P. 228, 229.) <Q>He that will not be so far a rational Creature, as to reflect seriously upon infinite Happiness and Misery, must needs condemn himself, as not making that Use
<PB N="56" REF="008118_0076_0F6B578346ABD320"/>
of his Understanding he should. The Rewards and Punishments of another Life, which the Almighty has established, as the Enforcements of his Laws, are of Weight enough to determine the Choice, against what∣soever Pleasure or Pain this Life can show. When the eternal State is considered but in it's bare Possibility, which no Body can make any Doubt of, he that will allow exquisite and endless Happiness to be but the possible Consequence of a good Life here, and the contrary State the possible Reward of a bad one, must own himself to judge very much amiss, if he does not conclude that a virtuous Life, with the certain Expec∣tation of everlasting Bliss, which may come, is to be preferred to a vicious one, with the Fear of that dread∣ful State of Misery, which 'tis very possible may over∣take the guilty, or at least the terrible uncertain Hope of Annihilation. This is so evidently so; tho' the virtuous Life here had Nothing but Pain, and the vicious continual Pleasure; which yet is for the most Part quite otherwise, and wicked Men have not much the Odds to bragg of, even in their present Possession; Nay, all things rightly considered, have I think even the worst Part here. But when infinite Happiness is put in one Scale, against infinite Misery in the other; if the worst that comes to the pious Man, if he mistakes, be the best that the wicked Man can attain to, if he be in the right; who can, without Madness, run the Venture? Who in his Wits would chuse to come with∣in a Possibility of infinite Misery? which if he miss, there is yet Nothing to be got by that Hazzard: Where∣as, on the other Side, the sober Man ventures Nothing, against infinite Happiness to be got, if his Expectation comes to pass.</Q></P>
<P>That Disposition of Mind which is a Propensity to act contrary to Reason, is a depraved Disposition. 'Tis not because the Faculty of Reason, which God has given to Mankind, is not sufficient fully to discover to 'em that forty, sixty, or an hundred Years, is as Nothing in Com∣parison
<PB N="57" REF="008118_0077_0F6B5783C5033BD0"/>
of Eternity, infinitely less than a second of Time to an hundred Years, that the greatest worldly Prosperity and Pleasure is not treated with most perfect Disregard, in all Cases where there is any Degree of Competition of earth∣ly Things, with Salvation from exquisite eternal Misery, and the Enjoyment of everlasting Glory and Felicity; as certainly it would be, if Men acted according to Rea∣son. But is it a Matter of Doubt or Controversy, whether Men in general don't shew a strong Disposition to act far otherwise, from their Infancy, 'till Death is in a sensible Approach? In things that concern Men's temporal In∣terest, they easily discern the Difference between Things of a long and short Continuance. 'Tis no hard Matter to convince Men of the Difference between a being ad∣mitted to the Accommodations, and Entertainments of a convenient, beautiful, well-furnished Habitation, and to partake of the Provisions and Produce of a plentiful E∣state, for a Day, or a Night; and having all given to them, and settled upon them, as their own, to possess as long as they live, and to be their's, and their Heirs for ever: There would be no Need of Men's preaching Sermons, and spending their Strength and Life, to convince Men of the Difference. Men know how to adjust Things in their Dealings and Contracts one with another, according to the Length of Time in which any thing agreed for is to be used or enjoyed. In temporal Affairs, Men are sensible that it concerns 'em to provide for future Time, as well as for the present. Thus common Prudence teaches 'em to take Care in Summer to lay up for Winter; yea, to provide a Fund, and get a solid Estate, whence they may be supplied for a long Time to come. And not only so, but they are willing and forward to spend and be spent, to provide that which will stand their Children in Stead, after they are dead; tho' it be quite uncertain, who shall use and enjoy what they lay up, after they have left the World; and if their Children should have the Comfort of it, as they desire, they will not partake with them in that Comfort, or have any more a Portion in any thing
<PB N="58" REF="008118_0078_0F6B5784924B5598"/>
under the Sun. In things which relate to Men's temporal Interest, they seem very sensible of the Uncertainty of Life, especially of the Lives of others; and to make an∣swerable Provision for the Security of their worldly In∣terest, that no considerable Part of it may rest only on so uncertain a Foundation, as the Life of a Neighbour or Friend. Common Discretion leads Men to take good Care, that their outward Possessions be well secured, by a good and firm Title. In worldly Concerns, Men are discerning of their Opportunities, and careful to improve 'em before they are pass'd. The Husbandman is care∣ful to plow his Ground, and sow his Seed, in the proper Season; otherwise he knows he can't expect a Crop: and when the Harvest is come, he will not sleep away the Time; for he knows, if he does so, the Crop will soon be lost. How careful and eagle-eyed is the Merchant to observe and improve his Opportunities and Advantages, to enrich himself? How apt are Men to be alarmed at the Appearance of Danger to their worldly Estate, or any thing that remarkably threatens great Loss or Damage to their outward Interest? and how will they bestir them∣selves in such a Case, if possible to avoid the threaten'd Calamity? In things purely secular, and not of a moral or spiritual Nature, Men easily receive Conviction by past Experience, when any thing, on repeated Trial, proves unprofitable or prejudicial; and are ready to take Warn∣ing by what they have found themselves, and also by the Experience of their Neighbours, and Forefathers.</P>
<P>But if we consider how Men generally conduct them∣selves in things on which their Well-being does infinitely more depend, how vast is the Diversity? In these things, how cold, lifeless and dilatory? With what Difficulty are a Few of Multitudes excited to any tolerable Degree of Care and Diligence, by the innumerable Means used with Men to make 'em wise for themselves? And when some Vigilance and Activity is excited, how apt is it to die a∣way, like a meer Force against a natural Tendency? What Need of a constant Repetition of Admonitions and
<PB N="59" REF="008118_0079_0F6B578545A70580"/>
Counsels, to keep the Heart from failing asleep? How many Objections are made? And how are Difficulties mag∣nified? And how soon is the Mind discouraged? How many Arguments, and often renewed, and variously and elaborately enforced, do Men stand in Need of, to con∣vince 'em of things that are self-evident? As that things which are eternal, are infinitely more important than things temporal, &amp; the like. And after all, how very few con∣vinced effectually, or in such a Manner as to induce to a practical Preference of eternal Things? How senseless are Men of the Necessity of improving their Time to pro∣vide for Futurity, as to their spiritual Interest, and their Welfare in another World? Tho' it be an endless Futu∣rity, and tho' it be their own personal, infinitely important Good, after they are dead, that is to be cared for, and not the Good of their Children, which they shall have no Share in.—Tho' Men are so sensible of the Uncertainty of their Neighbours Lives, when any considerable Part of their Estates depends on the Continuance of them; how stupidly senseless do they seem to be of the Uncertainty of their own Lives, when their Preservation from im∣mensely great, remediless and endless Misery, is risqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a present Delay, thro' a Dependence on future Oppor∣tunity? What a dreadful Venture will Men carelesly and boldly run, and repeat and multiply, with Regard to their eternal Salvation, who are very careful to have every Thing in a Deed or Bond firm, and without a Flaw? How negligent are they of their special Advantages and Opportunities for their Soul's Good? How hardly awa∣ken'd by the most evident and imminent Dangers, threa∣tening eternal Destruction, yea, tho' put in Mind of 'em, and much Pains taken to point them forth▪ shew them plainly, and fully to represent them, if possible to engage their Attention to 'em? How are they like the Horse, that boldly rushes into the Battle? How hardly are Men convinced by their own frequent and abundant Experi∣ence, of the unsatisfactory Nature of earthly Things, and the Instability of their own Hearts in their good Frames
<PB N="60" REF="008118_0080_0F6B57861301EFB0"/>
and Intentions? And how hardly convinced by their own Observation, and the Experience of all past Generations, of the Uncertainty of Life, and it's Enjoyments? Psal. xlix. 11, &amp;c. <HI>Their inward Thought is, that their Houses shall continue forever.—Nevertheless, Man being in Honour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bideth not; he is like the Beasts that perish. This their Way is their Folly: yet their Pos∣terity approve their Sayings. Like Sheep are they laid in the Grave.</HI></P>
<P>In these Things, Men that are prudent for their tem∣poral Interest, act as if they were bereft of Reason: <HI>They have Eyes, and see not; Ears, and hear not; neither do they understand: They are like the Horse and Mul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Understanding.</HI>—Jer. viii. 7. <HI>The Stork in the Heaven knoweth her appointed Times; and the Turtl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Crane, and the Swallow, observe the Time of their Coming: But my People know not the Judgment of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>These things are often mentioned in Scripture as Evi∣dences of extreme Folly and Stupidity, wherein Men act as great Enemies to themselves, as tho' they loved their own Ruin; <HI>Prov.</HI> viii. 36. Laying wait for their own Blood▪ <HI>Prov.</HI> 1. 18. And how can these things be accounted for, but by supposing a most wretched Depravity of Na∣ture? Why otherwise should not Men be as wise for themselves in spiritual and eternal Things, as in temporal? All Christians will confess, that Man's Faculty of Reason was given him chiefly to enable him to understand the former, wherein his main Interest, and true Happiness consists. This Faculty would therefore undoubtedly be every Way as fit for the understanding of them, as the latter, if not depraved. The Reason why these are un∣derstood and not the other, is not that such things as have been mentioned, belonging to Men's spiritual and eternal Interest, are more obscure and abstruse in their own Na∣ture. For Instance, the Difference between long and short, the Need of providing for Futurity, the Importance of improving proper Opportunities, and of having good
<PB N="61" REF="008118_0081_0F6B5786CF12A480"/>
Security, and a sure Foundation, in Affairs wherein our Interest is greatly concerned, &amp;c. these things are as plain in themselves in religious Matters, as in other Matters. And we have far greater Means to assist us to be wise for our selves in eternal, than in temporal Things. We have the abundant Instruction of perfect and infinite Wisdom it self, to lead &amp; conduct us in the Paths of Righteousness, so that we may not err. And the Reasons of Things are most clearly, variously and abundantly set before us in the Word of God; which is adapted to the Faculties of Mankind, tending greatly to enlighten and convince the Mind: Whereas, we have no such excellent and perfect Rules to instruct and direct us in Things pertaining to our temporal Interest, nor any thing to be compared to it.</P>
<P>If any should say, 'Tis true, if Men gave full Credit to what they are told concerning eternal Things, and these appeared to 'em as real and certain Things, it would be an Evidence of a sort of Madness in them, that they shew no greater Regard to 'em in Practice: But there is Rea∣son to think, this is not the Case; the Things of another World, being unseen things, appear to Men as things of a very doubtful Nature, and attended with great Uncer∣tainty.—In Answer, I would observe, agreeable to what has been cited from Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> Though eternal things were considered in their bare Possibility, if Men acted rationally, they would infinitely outweigh all temporal Things in their Influence on their Hearts. And I would also ob∣serve, that the supposing eternal Things not to be fully believed, at least by them who enjoy the Light of the Gospel, does not weaken, but rather strengthen the Argu∣ment for the Depravity of Nature. For the eternal World being what God had chiefly in View in the Cre∣ation of Men, and the Things of this World being made to be wholly subordinate to the other, Man's State here being only a State of Probation, Preparation &amp; Progression, with respect to the future State, and so eternal Things being in Effect Men's All, their whole Concern: to un∣derstand and know which, it chiefly was, that they had Un∣derstanding

given 'em; and it concerning them infinitely more to know the Truth of eternal Things than any other, as all that are not Infidels will own; Therefore, we may undoubtedly conclude, that if Men have not Respect to 'em as real and certain Things, it cannot be for Want of sufficient Evidence of their Truth, to induce 'em so to regard them; especially as to them that live under that Light, which God has appointed as the most proper Ex∣hibition of the Nature and Evidence of these Things: But it must be from a dreadful Stupidity of Mind, oc∣casioning a sottish Insensibility of their Truth and Im∣portance, when manifested by the clearest Evidence.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>That Man's Nature is corrupt, appears, in that vastly the greater Part of Mankind, in all Ages, have been wicked Men.</HEAD>
<P>THE Depravity of Man's Nature appears, not only in it's Propensity to Sin in <HI>some Degree,</HI> which renders a Man an evil or wicked Man an evil or wicked Man in the <HI>Eye of the Law,</HI> and strict Justice, as was before shewn; but it is so corrupt, that it's Depravity, either shews that Men <HI>are,</HI> or tends to make them <HI>to be,</HI> of such an evil Character, as shall denominate them wicked Men, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>This may be argued from several Things which have been already observed: as from a Tendency to continual Sin; a Tendency to much greater Degrees of Sin than Righteousness, and from the general extreme Stupidity of Mankind. But yet the present State of Man's Na∣ture, as implying, or tending to a <HI>wicked Character,</HI> may be worthy to be more particularly considered, and directly proved. And in general, this appears, in that there have been so very Few in the World, from Age to Age, ever since the World has stood, that have been of any other Character.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="008118_0083_0F6B578A44700838"/>'Tis abundantly evident in Scripture, and is what I suppose none that call themselves Christians will deny, that the whole World is divided into Good and Bad, and that all Mankind at the Day of Judgment will either be approved as righteous, or condemned as wicked; either glorified, as <HI>Children of the Kingdom,</HI> or cast into a Fur∣nace of Fire, as <HI>Children of the wicked One.</HI></P>
<P>I need not stand to shew what Things belong to the Character of such as shall hereafter be accepted as Righ∣teous, according to the Word of God. It may be suf∣ficient for my present Purpose, to observe what Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself speaks of as belonging essentially to the Character of such. In P. 203. He says, <Q>This is infallibly the Character of true Christians, and what is essential to such, that they have really mortified the Flesh, with it's Lusts;—They are dead to Sin, and live no longer therein; The old Man is crucified, and the Body of Sin destroyed: They yield themselves to God, as those that are alive from the Dead, and their Members as Instruments of Righteousness to God, and as Servants of Righteousness to Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness.</Q>—There is more to the like Purpose in the two next Pages. In P. 228. He says, <Q>Whatsoever is evil and corrupt in us, we ought to con∣demn; not so, as it shall still remain in us, that we may always be condemning it, but that we may speedily re∣form, and be effectually delivered from it; otherwise certainly we do not come up to the Character of the true Disciples of Christ.</Q></P>
<P>In P. 248. He says, <Q>Unless God's Favour be pre∣fer'd before all other Enjoyments whatsoever, unless there be a Delight in the Worship of God, and in Con∣verse with Him, unless every Appetite be brought into Subjection to Reason and Truth, and unless there be a kind and benevolent Disposition towards our Fellow-Creatures, how can the Mind be fit to dwell with God, in his House and Family, to do him Service in his Kingdom, and to promote the Happiness of any Part of his Creation?</Q>—And in his Key, § 255. P. 145.
<PB N="64" REF="008118_0084_0F6B578B67324188"/>
&amp;c. shewing there, <HI>what it is to be a true Christian,</HI> He says, among other Things, <Q>That he is one who has such a Sense and Persuasion of the Love of God in Christ, that he devotes his Life to the Honour and Service of God, in Hope of eternal Glory. And that to the Character of a true Christian, it is absolutely necessary, that he diligently study the Things that are freely given him of God, <HI>viz.</HI> his Election, Regenera∣tion, &amp;c. that he may gain a just Knowledge of those inestimable Privileges, may taste that the Lord is gra∣cious, and rejoyce in the Gospel-Salvation, as his greatest Happiness and Glory.—'Tis necessary, that he work these Blessings on his Heart, 'till they become a vital Principle, producing in him the Love of God, engaging him to all chearful Obedience to his Will, giving him a proper Dignity and Elevation of Soul, raising him above the best and worst of this World, carrying his Heart into Heaven, and fixing his Affec∣tions and Regards upon his everlasting Inheritance, and the Crown of Glory laid up for him there.—Thus he is armed against all the Temptations and Trials, resulting from any Pleasure or Pain, Hopes or Fears, Gain or Loss, in the present World. None of these things move him, from a faithful Discharge of any Part of his Duty, or from a firm Attachment to Truth and Righteousness: neither counts he his very Life dear to him, that he may do the Will of God, and finish his Course with Joy, in a Sense of the Love of God and Christ. He maintains daily Communion with God, by reading &amp; meditating on his Word. In a Sense of his own Infirmity, and the Readiness of the divine Favour to succour him, he daily addresses the Throne of Grace, for the Renewal of spiritual Strength; and in Assurance of obtaining it, thro' one Mediator Christ Jesus, en∣lightened and directed by the heavenly Doctrine of the Gospel, &amp;c.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> says of the Character of a good Man, is also worthy to be observed, <HI>Chris.

<P><PB N="65" REF="008118_0085_0F6B578C03016CA8"/>Now I leave it to be judged by every One that has any Degree of Impartiality, whether there be not sufficient Grounds to think, from what appears every where, that it is but a very small Part indeed, of the many Myriads and Millions which overspread this Globe, who are of a Character that in any wise answers these Descriptions. However, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> insists, that all Nations, and every Man on the Face of the Earth, have Light and Means sufficient to do the whole Will of God, even they that live in the grossest Darkness of Paganism.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> in Answer to Arguments of this Kind, very impertinently from Time to Time objects, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 327, 339, 340, 343, 344, 348.</NOTE> That we are no Judges of the Viciousness of Men's Character, nor are able to decide in what Degree they are virtuous or vicious. As tho' we could have no good Grounds to judge, that any thing, appertaining to the Qualities or Properties of the Mind, which is invisible, is general or prevailing among a Multi∣tude or collective Body, unless we can determine how it is with each Individual. I think, I have sufficient Reason, from what I know &amp; have heard of the <HI>American Indians,</HI> to judge, that there are not many good Philosophers among them; tho' the Thoughts of their Hearts, and the Ideas and Knowledge they have in their Minds, are Things in∣visible; and tho' I have never seen so much as the thousandth Part of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and with respect to most of them, should not be able to pronounce peremp∣torily, concerning any one, that he was not very knowing in the Nature of Things, if all should singly pass before me. And Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself seems to be sensible of the Falseness of his own Conclusions, that he so often urges against others; if we may judge by his Practice, and the Liberties he takes, in judging of a Multitude himself. He, it seems, is sensible that a Man may have good Grounds to judge, that Wickedness of Character is general in a collective Body; because he openly does it Himself. (<HI>Key,</HI> P. 147.) After declaring the Things which be∣long

to the Character of a true Christian, he judges of the Generality of Christians, that they have cast off these Things, that <HI>they are a People that do err in their Hearts, and have not known God's Ways.</HI> P. 259, he judges, that <HI>the Generality of Christians are the most Wicked of all Mankind,</HI>—when he thinks it will throw some Disgrace on the Opinion of such as he opposes. The like we have from Time to Time in other Places, as P. 268. P. 258. Key, P. 182.</P>
<P>But if Men are not sufficient Judges, whether there are Few of the World of Mankind but what are Wicked, yet doubtless God is sufficient, and his Judgment, often declared in his Word, determines the Matter. Matth. vii. 13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the strait Gate: For wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to De∣struction, and many there be that go in thereat; Because strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way that leadeth to Life, and few there be that find it.</HI> 'Tis manifest, that here Christ is not only describing the State of things, as it was at that Day, and don't mention the comparative Smallness of the Number of them that are saved, as a Con∣sequence of the peculiar Perverseness of that People, and of that Generation; but as a Consequence of the general Circumstances of the Way to Life, and the Way to De∣struction, the Broadness of the one, and Narrowness of the other. In the Straitness of the Gate, &amp;c. I suppose none will deny, that Christ has Respect to the Strictness of those Rules, which he had insisted on in the preceeding Sermon, &amp;, which render the Way to Life very difficult to Mankind. But certainly these amiable Rules would not be difficult, were they not contrary to the natural Incli∣nations of Men's Hearts; and they would not be contrary to those Inclinations, were these not depraved. Conse∣quently the Wideness of the Gate. and Broadness of the Way that leads to Destruction, in Consequence of which many go in thereat, must imply the Agreeableness of this Way to Men's natural Inclinations. The like Reason is given by Christ, why few are saved. Luke xiii. 23, 24.
<PB N="67" REF="008118_0087_0F6B578D85693160"/>
<HI>Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few saved? And he said unto them; Strive to enter in at the strait Gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</HI> That there are generally but few good Men in the World, even among them that have those most distinguishing &amp; glorious Advantages for it, which they are favoured with that live under the Gospel, is evident by that Saying of our Lord, from Time to Time in his Mouth, <HI>Many are called, but few are chosen.</HI> And if there are but few among these, how few, how very few indeed, must Persons of this Character be, compared with the whole World of Mankind? The exceeding Smallness of the Number of true Saints, compared with the whole World, appears by the Representations often made of them as distinguished from the World; in which they are spoken of as called and chosen <HI>out of the World,</HI> redeemed <HI>from the Earth,</HI> redeemed <HI>from among Men;</HI> as being those that are <HI>of God,</HI> while the <HI>whole World</HI> lieth in Wicked∣ness, and the like. And if we look into the Old Testa∣ment, we shall find the same Testimony given. Prov. xx. 6. <HI>Most Men will proclaim every Man his own Goodness: but a faithful Man who can find?</HI> By a faithful Man, as the Phrase is used in Scripture, is intended much the same as a sincere, upright or truly good Man; as in Psal. xii. 1. and xxxi. 23. and ci. 6. and other Places. Again, Eccl. vii. 25,—29. <HI>I applied mine Heart to know, and to search, and to find out Wisdom, and the Reason of Things, and to know the Wickedness of Folly, even of Foolishness and Madness: And I find more bitter than Death, the Woman whose Heart is Snares,</HI> &amp;c.—<HI>Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, counting one by one, to find out the Account, which yet my Soul seeketh, but I find not: One Man among a Thousand have I found; but a Woman among all these have I not found. Lo, this only have I found, that God made Man upright; but they have sought out many Inventions. Solomon</HI> here signifies, that when he set himself diligently to find out the Account or Proportion of true Wisdom,
<PB N="68" REF="008118_0088_0F6B578EAE8725E8"/>
or thorough Uprightness among Men, the Result was, that he found it to be but as one to a Thousand▪ &amp;c. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> on this Place, P. 184. says, <Q>The wise Man in the Context is inquiring into the Corruption and Depra∣vity of Mankind, of the Men and Women, THAT LIV'D IN HIS TIME.</Q> As tho' what He said represented Nothing of the State of Things in the World in general, but only <HI>in his Time.</HI> But does Dr. <HI>T.</HI> or any Body else suppose this only to be the Design of that Book, to represent the Vanity and Evil of the World in that Time, and to shew that all was Vanity and Vexation of Spirit in <HI>Solomon's</HI> Day? (Which Day truly we have Rea∣son to think, was a Day of the greatest Smiles of Heaven on that Nation, that ever had been on any Nation from the Foundation of the World.) Not only does the Sub∣ject and Argument of the whole Book shew it to be other∣wise; but also the declared Design of the Book in the first Chapter; where the World is represented as very much the same, as to the Vanity and Evil it is full of, from Age to Age, making little or no Progress, after all it's Revolutions &amp; restless Motions, Labours and Pursuits, like the Sea, that has all the Rivers constantly emptying them∣selves into-it, from Age to Age, and yet is never the fuller. As to that Place, Prov. xx. 6. <HI>A faithful Man who can find?</HI> there is no more Reason to suppose, that the wise Man has respect only to <HI>his</HI> Time, in these Words, than in those immediately preceeding, <HI>Counsel in the Heart of a Man is like deep Waters; but a Man of Understand∣ing will draw it out.</HI> Or in the Words next following, <HI>The just Man walketh in his Integrity: his Children are blessed after him.</HI> Or, in any other Proverb in the whole Book. And if it were so, that <HI>Solomon</HI> in these things meant only to describe his own Times, it would not at all weaken the Argument. For, if we observe the History of the Old Testament, there is Reason to think there never was any Time from <HI>Joshua</HI> to the Captivity, wherein Wickedness was more restrained, and Virtue and Religion more encouraged and promoted, than in <HI>David's</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="008118_0089_0F6B578F22D66560"/>
and <HI>Solomon's</HI> Times. And if there was so little true Piety in that Nation that was the only People of God under Heaven, even in their very best Times, what may we suppose concerning the World in general, take one Time with another?</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what some Authors advance concern∣ing the Prevalence of Virtue, Honesty, good Neighbour∣hood, Cheerfulness, &amp;c. in the World, <HI>Solomon,</HI> whom we may justly esteem as wise and just an Observer of human Nature, and the State of the World of Mankind, as most in these Days (besides, Christians ought to remem∣ber, that he wrote by divine Inspiration) judged the World to be so full of Wickedness, that it was better never to be born, than to be born to live only in such a World. Eccl. iv. at the Beginning, <HI>So I returned and considered all the Oppressions that are done under the Sun; and behold, the Tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no Comforter: and on the Side of their Oppressors there was Power; but they had no Comforter. Where∣fore, I praised the dead, which were already dead, more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been; WHO HATH NOT SEEN THE EVIL WORK THAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN.</HI> Surely it will not be said, that <HI>Solomon</HI> has only respect to <HI>his</HI> Times here too, when he speaks of the Oppressions of them that were in Power; since He himself, and others appointed by him, and wholly under his Controul, were the Men that were in Power, in that Land, and in almost all neighbour∣ing Countries.</P>
<P>The same inspired Writer says, Eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ix. 3. <HI>The Heart of the Sons of Men is full of Evil; and Madness is in their Heart while they live; and after that they go to the dead.</HI> If these general Expressions are to be understood only of some, and those the lesser Part, when in general, <HI>Truth, Honesty, Good-Nature,</HI> &amp;c. govern the World, why are such general Expressions from Time to Time used?

Prince express himself in a more generous and be∣nevolent Strain, as well as more agreeable to Truth, and say, <HI>Wisdom is in the Hearts of the Sons of Men while they live,</HI> &amp;c.—in Stead of leaving in his Writings so many sly, ill-natur'd Suggestions, which pour such Con∣tempt on the human Nature, and tend so much to excite mutual Jealousy and Malevolence, to taint the Minds of Mankind thro' all Generations after him?</P>
<P>If we consider the various successive Parts and Periods of the Duration of the World, it will, if possible, be yet more evident, that vastly the greater Part of Mankind have in all Ages been of a wicked Character. The short Accounts we have of <HI>Adam</HI> and his Family are such as lead us to suppose, that far the greater Part of his Posterity, in his Life-time, yea, in the former Part of his Life, were Wicked. It appears, that his eldest Son, <HI>Cain,</HI> was a very wicked Man, who slew his righteous Brother <HI>Abel.</HI> And <HI>Adam</HI> lived an hundred and thirty Years before <HI>Seth</HI> was born: And by that Time, we may suppose, his Posterity began to be considerably numerous: When he was born, his Mo∣ther <HI>called his Name</HI> Seth; <HI>for God, said She, hath appointed me another Seed, in Stead of</HI> Abel. Which na∣turally suggests this to our Thoughts; That of all her Seed now existing, none were of any such Note for Religion and Virtue, as that their Parents could have any great Comfort in them, or Expectation from 'em on that Account. And by the brief History we have, it looks as if (however there might be some Intervals of a Revival of Religion, yet) in the general, Mankind grew more and more corrupt till the Flood. 'Tis signified, that <HI>when Men began to mul∣tiply on the Face of the Earth,</HI> Wickedness prevailed exceedingly, Gen. vi. at the Beginning. And that before God appeared to <HI>Noah,</HI> to command him to build the Ark, 120 Years before the Flood, the World had long continued obstinate in great and general Wickedness, and the Disease was become inveterate. The Expressions we have in the 3▪ 5, and 6 Verses of that Chap. suggest as much: <HI>And the Lord said, My spirit shall not ALWAYS strive
<PB N="71" REF="008118_0091_0F6B579080748038"/>
with Man.—And God saw, that the Wickedness of Man was great on the Earth, and that every Imagin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion of the Thoughts of his Heart was evil, only evil CONTINUALLY; and it repented the Lord, that he had made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart.</HI> And by that Time <HI>all Flesh had corrupted his Way upon the Earth,</HI> v. 12. And as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself observes, P. 122. <Q>Mankind were universally debauch'd into Lust, Sensuality, Rapine and Injustice.</Q></P>
<P>And with respect to the Period <HI>after</HI> the Flood, to the Calling of <HI>Abraham;</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, as has been already observed, that in about 400 Years after the Flood, the Generality of Mankind were fallen into Idolatry. Which was before the passing away of one Generation; or before all they were dead, that came out of the Ark. And it can't be thought, the World jumpt into that so general and extreme Degree of Corruption, all at once; but that they had been gradually growing more and more corrupt; tho' it is true, it must be by very swift Degrees, (however soon we may suppose they began)—to get to that Pass in one Age.</P>
<P>And as to the Period from the Calling of <HI>Abraham</HI> to the Coming of <HI>Christ,</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> justly observes as follows (<HI>Key</HI> P. 190.) <Q>If we reckon from the Call of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> to the Coming of Christ, the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation continued One Thousand nine Hundred &amp; twenty-one Years: during which Period, the other Families and Nations of the Earth, not only lay out of God's pecu∣liar Kingdom, but also lived in Idolatry, great Ignorance, and Wickedness.</Q> And with Regard to that one only exempt Family or Nation of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> 'tis evident that Wickedness was the generally prevailing Character among them, from Age to Age. If we consider how it was with <HI>Jacob's</HI> Family, the Behaviour of <HI>Reuben</HI> with his Father's Concubine, the Behaviour of <HI>Judah</HI> with <HI>Tamar,</HI> the Conduct of <HI>Jacob's</HI> Sons in general (tho' Sim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on and Levi were leading) towards the <HI>Shechemites,</HI> the Behaviour of <HI>Joseph's</HI> ten Brethren in their cruel

Treatment of him; we can't think, that the Character of true Piety belonged to many of them, according to Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> own Notion of such a Character; tho' it be true, they might afterwards repent.—And with respect to the Time the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were in <HI>Egypt;</HI> the Scrip∣ture, speaking of them in general, or as a collective Body, often represents them as complying with the abominable Idolatries of the Country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. xvii. 7. Josh. v. 9. and xxiv. 14. Ezek. xx. 7, 8. and xxiii. 3.</NOTE> And as to that Generation which went out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and wandred in the Wilder∣ness; they are abundantly represented as extremely and almost universally wicked, perverse, and Children of di∣vine Wrath.—And after <HI>Joshua's</HI> Death, the Scripture is very express, that Wickedness was the prevailing Charac∣ter in the Nation, from Age to Age. So it was till <HI>Samuel's</HI> Time. 1 Sam. viii. 7, 8. <HI>They have rejected me, that I should not reign over them; according to all their Works which they have done, since the Day that I brought them out of</HI> Egypt, <HI>unto this Day.</HI> Yes, so it was till <HI>Jeremiah's</HI> and <HI>Ezekiel's</HI> Time. Jer. xxxii. 30, 31. <HI>For the Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>and the Children of</HI> Judah, <HI>have</HI> only <HI>done Evil before me</HI> from their Youth: <HI>for the Children of</HI> Israel have only <HI>provoked me to Anger with the Work of their Hands, saith the Lord: For this City ▪hath been to me a Provocation of mine Anger, and of my Fury,</HI> from the Day they built it, even unto this Day. (Compare Chap. v. 21, and 23. and Chap. vii. 25, 26, 27.) So, Ezek. ii. 3, 4. <HI>I send thee to the Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>to a rebellious Nation, that hath rebelled against me, they and their Fathers have transgressed against me</HI> even unto this very Day: <HI>for they are impudent Chil∣dren,</HI> and <HI>stiff-hearted.</HI>—And it appears by the Discourse of <HI>Stephen</HI> (Acts vii.) that this was generally the Case with that Nation, from their first Rise, even to the Days of the Apostles. After his summary Rehearsal of the Instances of their Perverseness from the very Time of their selling <HI>Joseph</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> he concludes(v. 51, 52, 53.)
<PB N="73" REF="008118_0093_0F6B579418CD9430"/>
<HI>Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in Heart and Ears, ye d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> ALWAYS <HI>resist the Holy Ghost. As your Fa∣thers did, so do ye. Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers persecuted? And they have stain them which shewed before of the Coming of that just One, of whom Ye have been now the Betrayers and Murderers: Who have received the Law by the Disposition of Angels, and have not kept it.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, that Wickedness was the generally prevailing Character in all the Nations of Mankind, till Christ came. And so also it appears to have been since his Coming, to this Day. So in the Age of the Apostles: tho' then, among those that were converted to Christianity, were great Numbers of Persons eminent for Piety; yet this was not the Case with the greater Part of the World, or the greater Part of any one Nation in it. There was a great Number of Persons of a truly pious Character in the latter Part of the apostoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Age, when Multitudes of Converts had been made, and Christianity was as yet in it's primitive Purity. But what says the Apostle <HI>John</HI> of the Church of God at that Time, as compared with the Rest of the World? 1 Joh. v. 19. <HI>We know that we are of God, an</HI> the whole World <HI>lieth in Wickedness.</HI> And after Christianity came to prevail, to that Degree, that Christians had the upper Hand in Nations and civil Com∣munities, still the greater Part of Mankind remain'd in their old Heathen State; which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> speaks of as a State of great Ignorance and Wickedness. And besides, this is noted in all Ecclesiastical History, that as the Christians gain'd in Power and secular Advantages, true Piety declined, and Corruption and Wickedness prevail'd among them.—And as to the State of the Christian World, since Christianity began to be established by human Laws, Wickedness for the most Part has greatly prevailed; as is very notorious, and is implied in what Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself says: He, in giving an Account how the Doctrine of Original Sin came to prevail among Christians, says, P. 443. <Q>That the Christian Religion was very early and
<PB N="74" REF="008118_0094_0F6B5794CA2682C0"/>
grievously corrupted, by dreaming, ignorant, superstitious Monks.</Q> In P. 259. he says, <Q>The Generality of Christians have embraced this Persuasion concerning Original Sin; and the Consequence has been, that the Generality of Christians have been the most wicked, lewd, bloody and treacherous of all Mankind.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, a View of the several successive Periods of the past Duration of the World, from the Beginning to this Day, shews, that Wickedness has ever been exceeding pre∣valent, and has had vastly the Superiority in the World. And Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself in Effect owns, that it has been so ever since <HI>Adam</HI> first turned into the Way of Transgres∣sion. P. 168. <Q>It is certain (says he) the moral Cir∣cumstances of Mankind, since the Time <HI>Adam</HI> first turned into the Way of Transgression, have been very different from a State of Innocence. So far as we can judge from History, or what we know at present, the greatest Part of Mankind, have been, and still are very corrupt; tho' not equally so in every Age and Place.</Q> And lower in the same Page, he speaks of <HI>Adam's Pos∣terity,</HI> as <HI>having sunk themselves into the most lamenta∣ble Degrees of Ignorance, Superstition, Idolatry, In∣justice, Debauchery,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>These Things clearly determine the Point, concerning the Tendency of Man's Nature to Wickedness, if we may be allowed to proceed according to such Rules &amp; Methods of Reasoning, as are universally made use of, and never denied, or doubted to be good and sure, in experimental Philosophy; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Turnbull,</HI> tho' so great an Enemy to the Doctrine of the Depravity of Nature, yet greatly insists upon it, that the experimental Method of Reasoning ought to be gone into in moral Matters, and Things pertaining to the human Nature; and should chiefly be relied upon, in moral, as well as natural Philosophy.

Hearts of Mankind, one would think the Experience of so many Ages as have elapsed since the Beginning of the World, and the Trial as it were made by Hundreds of different Nations together, for so long a Time, should be sufficient to convince all, that Wickedness is agreeable to the Nature of Mankind in it's present State.</P>
<P>Here, to strengthen the Argument, if there were any Need of it, I might observe some further Evidences than those which have been already mentioned, not only of the <HI>Extent</HI> and <HI>Generality</HI> of the Prevalence of Wickedness in the World, but of the <HI>Height</HI> to which it has risen, and the <HI>Degree</HI> in which it has reigned. Among innu∣merable Things which shew this, I shall now only observe this, <HI>viz.</HI> the Degree in which Mankind have from Age to Age been hurtful one to another. Many Kinds of brute Animals are esteemed very noxious and destructive, many of 'em very fierce, voracious,&amp; many very poisonous, and the destroying of 'em has always been looked upon as a public Benefit: but have not Mankind been a Thou∣sand Times as hurtful and destructive as any one of them, yea, as all the noyous Beasts, Birds, Fishes and Reptiles in the Earth, Air and Water, put together, at least, of all Kinds of Animals that are visible? And no Creature can be found any where so destructive of it's own Kind, as Mankind are. All others for the most Part are harmless and peaceable, with regard to their own Species. Where one Wolf is destroyed by another Wolf, one Viper by another, probably a Thousand of Mankind are destroyed by those of their own Species. Well therefore might our blessed Lord say, when sending forth his Disciples into the World, Matth. x. 16, 17. <HI>Behold, I send you forth as Sheep in the Midst of Wolves;</HI>—BUT BEWARE OF MEN. As much to say, I send you forth as Sheep among Wolves.—But why do I say, Wolves? I send you forth into the wide World of <HI>Men,</HI> that are far more hurtful and per∣nicious, and that you had much more Need to beware of, than Wolves.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="008118_0096_0F6B5795C15CF7F0"/>It would be strange indeed, that this should be the State of the World of Mankind, the chief of the lower Cre∣ation, distinguished above all by Reason, to that End that they might be capable of Religion, which summarily con∣sists in Love, if Men, as they come into the World, are in their Nature innocent and harmless, undepraved and per∣fectly free from all evil Propensities.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The native Depravity of Mankind appears, in that there has been so little good Effect of <HI>so manifold and great Means,</HI> used to promote Virtue in the World.</HEAD>
<P>THE Evidence of the native Corruption of Mankind appears much more glaring, when it is considered that the World has been so generally, so constantly, and so exceedingly corrupt, notwithstanding the <HI>various, great</HI> and <HI>continual Means,</HI> that have been used to restrain Men from Sin, and promote Virtue and true Religion among them.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes, all that Sorrow and Death, which came on Mankind, in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, was brought on them by God, in <HI>great Favour</HI> to them; as a <HI>benevolent Father</HI> exercising <HI>an wholsom Discipline</HI> to∣wards his Children; to restrain 'em from Sin, by <HI>increasing the Vanity of all earthly Things, to abate their Force to tempt &amp; delude;</HI> to induce 'em to be <HI>moderate in grati∣fying the Appetites of the Body;</HI> to <HI>mortify Pride and Ambition;</HI> and that Men might <HI>always have before their Eyes a striking Demonstration, that Sin is infinitely hate∣ful to God,</HI> by a Sight of That, <HI>than which Nothing is more proper to give them the utmost Abhorrence of Iniquity, and to fix in their Minds a Sense of the dreadful Con∣sequences of Sin,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. And in general, that they don't come as Punishments, but purely as Means to keep Men
<PB N="77" REF="008118_0097_0F6B579684DC9160"/>
from Vice, and to make them better.—If it be so, surely they are great Means indeed. Here is a mighty Altera∣tion: Mankind, once so easy and happy, healthful, vigo∣rous and beautiful, rich in all the pleasant and abundant Blessings of Paradise, now turned out, destitute, weak and decaying, into a wide barren World, yielding Briars and Thorns, in Stead of the delightful Growth and sweet Fruit of the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> to wear out Life in Sorrow and Toil, on the Ground cursed for his Sake; and at last, either through long Languishing and lingring Decay, or severe Pain and acute Disease, to expire and turn to Putre∣faction and Dust. If these are only used as <HI>Medicines,</HI> to prevent and to cure the Diseases of the Mind, they are sharp Medicines indeed; especially Death; which, to use <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> Representation, is as it were <HI>breaking all his Bones:</HI> And one would think, should be very effectual, if the Subject had no Depravity, no evil and contrary Biass, to resist and hinder a proper Effect; especially in the old World, when the Thing which was the first Occasion of this terrible Alteration, this severity of Means, was fresh in Memory; <HI>Adam</HI> continuing alive near two Thirds of the Time that passed before the Flood; so that a very great Part of those that were alive till the Flood, might have Opportunity of seeing and conversing with him, and hearing from his Mouth, not only an Account of his Fall, and the Introduction of the awful Consequences of it, but also of his first finding Himself in Existence in the new∣created World, and of the Creation of <HI>Eve,</HI> and the Things which passed between him and his Creator in Paradise.</P>
<P>But what was the Success of these great Means, to re∣strain Men from Sin, and to induce them to Virtue? Did they prove sufficient?—In Stead of this, the World soon grew exceeding corrupt; till it came to that, to use our Author's own Words, <HI>That Mankind were univer∣sally d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bauch'd into Lust, Sensuality, Rapine and In∣justice.</HI></P>
<P>Then God used further Means: He sent <HI>Noah,</HI> a
<PB N="78" REF="008118_0098_0F6B579747282358"/>
Preacher of Righteousness, to warn the World, of the uni∣versal Destruction which would come upon them by a Flood of Waters, if they went on in Sin. Which Warn∣ing he delivered with these Circumstances, tending to strike their Minds, and command their Attention; that he immediately went about building that vast Structure of the Ark; in which he must employ a great Number of Hands, and probably spent all he had in the World to save himself &amp; his Family. And under these uncommon Means, God waited upon them 120 Years.—But all to no Effect. The whole World, for ought appears, continued obstinate, and absolutely incorrigible: So that Nothing remain'd to be done with them, but utterly to destroy the Inhabitants of the Earth; and to begin a new World, from that single Family who had distinguished themselves by their Virtue; that from them might be propagated a new and purer Race.—Accordingly this was done: And the Inhabi∣tants of the new World, of <HI>Noah's</HI> Posterity, had these new and extraordinary Means to restrain Sin and excite Virtue, in Addition to the Toil, Sorrow, and common Mortality, which the World had been subjected to before in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin; <HI>viz.</HI> that God had new∣ly testified his dreadful Displeasure for Sin, in destroying the many Millions of Mankind, all at one blow, old and young, Men, Women and Children, without Pity on any for all the dismal Shrieks and Cries which the World was filled with; when they themselves, the remaining Fa∣mily, were so wonderfully distinguished by God's pre∣serving Goodness, that they might be a holy Seed, being delivered from the corrupting Examples of the old World; and being all the Offspring of a living Parent, whose pious Instructions and Counsels they had, to inforce these Things upon them, to prevent Sin, and engage them to their Duty. And these Inhabitants of the new Earth must, for a long Time, have before their Eyes many evident, and as it were fresh and striking Effects and Signs of that universal Destruction, to be a continual affecting Admoni∣tion to 'em. And besides all this, God now shortened the
<PB N="79" REF="008118_0099_0F6B5798BB51E5D8"/>
Life of Man, to about one half of what it used to be. The shortning Man's Life, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, P. 68. <Q>Was, that the wild Range of Ambition and Lust might be brought into narrower Bounds, and have less Oppor∣tunity of doing Mischief; and that Death, being still nearer to our View, might be a more powerful Motive to regard less the things of a transitory World, and to attend to the Rules of Truth and Wisdom.</Q></P>
<P>And now let us observe the Consequence.—These new and extraordinary Means, in Addition to the former, were so far from proving sufficient, that the new World degenerated, and became corrupt, by such swift Degrees, that, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> observes, Mankind in general were sunk into Idolatry, in about 400 Years after the Flood, and so in about 50 Years after <HI>Noah's</HI> Death: They be∣came so wicked and brutish, as to forsake the true God, and turn to the Worship of inanimate Creatures.</P>
<P>When Things were come to this dreadful Pass, God was pleased, for a Remedy, to introduce a new and won∣derful Dispensation; separating a particular Family and People, from all the rest of the World, by a Series of most astonishing Miracles, done in the open View of the World; and fixing their Dwelling, as it were in the Midst of the Earth, between <HI>Asia, Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and in the Midst of those Nations which were most considerable and famous for Power, Knowledge and Arts; that God might, in an extraordinary Manner, dwell amongst that People, in visible Tokens of his Presence, manifesting himself there, and from thence to the World, by a Course of great and miraculous Operations and Effects, for many Ages: that that People might be holy to God, and as a Kingdom of Priests, and might stand as a City on an Hill, to be a Light to the World: withal gradually shortning Man's Life, till it was brought to be but about one twelfth Part of what it used to be before the Flood; and so, according to Dr. <HI>T.</HI>—vastly cutting off and diminish∣ing his Temptations to Sin, and increasing his Excitements to Holiness.—And now let us consider what the Success
<PB N="80" REF="008118_0100_0F6B5799D4B6DF28"/>
of these Means was, both as to the <HI>Gentile</HI> World, and the Nation of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> justly observes (Key, § 50.) <Q>The Jewish Dispensation had Respect to the Nations of the World, to spread the Knowledge and Obedience of God in the Earth; and was established for the Benefit of all Man∣kind.</Q>—But how unsuccessful were these Means, and all other Means used with the <HI>Heathen</HI> Nations, so long as this Dispensation lasted? <HI>Abraham</HI> was a Person noted in all the principal Nations that were then in the World; as in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the eastern Monarchies: God made his Name famous by his wonderful distinguishing Dispen∣sations towards him, particularly by so miraculously sub∣duing before him, and his trained Servants, those Armies of the four eastern Kings. This great Work of the most High God, Possessor of Heaven and Earth, was greatly taken Notice of by <HI>Melchizedeck;</HI> and one would think, should have been sufficient to have awakened the Atten∣tion and Consideration of all the Nations in that Part of the World, and to have led them to the Knowledge and Worship of the only true God; especially if considered in Conjunction with that miraculous and most terrible De∣struction of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and all the Cities of the Plain, for their Wickedness, with <HI>Lot'</HI>s miraculous Deliverance; which doubtless were Facts, that in their Day were much famed abroad in the World. But there is not the least Appearance, in any Accounts we have, of any considerable good Effect. On the contrary, those Nations which were most in the Way of observing and being affected with these things, even the Nations of Canaan, grew worse and worse, till their Iniquity came to the full, in <HI>Joshua'</HI>s Time. And the Posterity of <HI>Lot,</HI> that Saint so wonderfully distinguished, soon became some of the most gross Idolaters; as they appear to have been in <HI>Moses'</HI>s Time. (See Num. xxv.) Yea, and the far greater Part even of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Posterity, the children of <HI>Ishmael, Ziman, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Jshbak and Shuah,</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> soon forgot the true God, and fell off to Hea∣thenism</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="008118_0101_0F6B579A436BEA60"/>Great Things were done in the Sight of the Nations of the World, tending to awaken them, and lead them to the Knowledge and Obedience of the true God, in <HI>Ja∣cob's</HI> and <HI>Joseph's</HI> Time; in that God did miraculously, by the Hand of <HI>Joseph,</HI> preserve from perishing by Fa∣mine, as it were the whole World; as appears by <HI>Gen.</HI> xli. 56, 57. Agreeably to which, the Name that <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI> gave to <HI>Joseph, Zaphnath-Paaneah,</HI> as is said, in the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Language, signifies <HI>Saviour of the World.</HI> But there does not appear to have been any good abiding Effect of this; no, not so much as in the Nation of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> (which seems to have been the chief of all the heathen Nations at that Day) who had these great Works of <HI>Jehovah</HI> in their most immediate View: on the con∣trary, they grew worse and worse, and seem to be far more gross in their Idolatries, and Ignorance of the true God, and every Way more wicked, and ripe for Ruin, when <HI>Moses</HI> was sent to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> than they were in <HI>Joseph's</HI> Time.</P>
<P>After this, in <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua's</HI> Time, the great God was pleased to manifest himself in a Series of the most astonishing Miracles, for about fifty Years together, wrought in the most publick Manner, in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the Wilderness, and in <HI>Canaan,</HI> in the View as it were of the whole World; Miracles by which the World was shaken, the whole Frame of the visible Creation, Earth, Seas and Rivers, the Atmosphere, the Clouds, Sun, Moon and Stars, were affected; Miracles greatly tending to convince the Na∣tions of the World, of the Vanity of their false Gods, shewing JEHOVAH to be infinitely above them, in the Thing wherein they dealt most proudly, and exhibiting God's awful Displeasure at the Wickedness of the hea∣then World. And these Things are expressly spoken of as one End of these great Miracles, in Exod. ix. 15. Num. xiv. 21. Josh. xiv. 23, 24. &amp; other Places. However, no Reformation followed these Things; but by the Scrip∣ture-Account, the Nations which had them most in View, were dreadfully hardened, stupidly refusing all Conviction
<PB N="82" REF="008118_0102_0F6B579B5BF8B8"/>
and Reformation, and obstinately went on in an Opposition to the living God, to their own Destruction.</P>
<P>After this, God did from time to time, very publickly manifest himself to the Nations of the World, by won∣derful Works wrought in the Time of the <HI>Judges,</HI> of a like Tendency with those already mentioned. Particularly in so miraculously destroying by the Hand of <HI>Gideon,</HI> almost the whole of that vast Army of the <HI>Midianites, Amalekites,</HI> and <HI>all the Children of the East,</HI> consisting of about 135000 Men; Judg. vii. 12. and viii. 12. But no Reformation followed this or the other great Works of God, wrought in the Times of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak, J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phtha</HI> and <HI>Sampson.</HI></P>
<P>After these Things, God used new, and in some Re∣spects much greater Means with the heathen World, to bring them to the Knowledge and Service of the true God, in the Days of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> He raised up <HI>David,</HI> a Man after his own Heart, a most fervent Worshipper of the true God, and zealous Hater of Idols, and sub∣dued before him almost all the Nations, between <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Euphrates;</HI> often miraculously assisting him in his Battles with his Enemies: and he confirmed <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son in the full and quiet Possession of that great Empire, for about forty Years; and made him the wisest, richest, most magnificent, and every Way the greatest Monarch that ever had been in the World; and by far the most famous, and of greatest Name among the Nations; especially for his Wisdom, and Things <HI>concerning the Name of his God;</HI> particularly the Temple he built, which was <HI>exceeding magnificent, that it might be of Fame and Glory through∣out all Lands;</HI> 1 Chron. xxii. 5. And we are told, that there came of all People to hear the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon,</HI> from all Kings of the Earth; 1 King. iv. 34. and x. 24. And the Scripture informs us, that these great Things were done, that the <HI>Nations in far Countries might hear of God's great Name, and of his out-stretched Arm; that all the People of the Earth might fear him, as well as his People Israel; And that all the People of the
<PB N="83" REF="008118_0103_0F6B579BC135A588"/>
Earth might know, that the LORD was God, and that there was none else.</HI> 1 King. viii. 41, 42, 43, 60. But still there is no Appearance of any considerable a∣biding Effect, with Regard to any one heathen Nation.</P>
<P>After this, before the Captivity into <HI>Babylon,</HI> many great Things were done in the Sight of the Gentile Na∣tions, very much tending to enlighten, affect and persuade them. As, God's destroying the Army of the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> of a Thousand Thousand, before <HI>Asa; Elijah'</HI>s and <HI>Elisha's</HI> Miracles; especially <HI>Elijah's</HI> miraculously con∣founding <HI>Baal's</HI> Prophets and Worshippers; <HI>Elisha's</HI> healing <HI>Naaman,</HI> the King of <HI>Syria's</HI> prime Minister, and the miraculous Victories obtain'd thro' <HI>Elisha's</HI> Prayers, over the <HI>Dyrians, Moabites</HI> an̄d <HI>Edomites;</HI> the miracu∣lous Destruction of the vast united Army of the Children of <HI>Moab, Ammon,</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> at <HI>Jehoshaphat's</HI> Prayer. (2 Chron. xx.) <HI>Jonah's</HI> preaching at <HI>Nineveh,</HI> together with the Miracle of his Deliverance from the Whale's Belly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which was published, and well attested, as a Sign to con∣firm his Preaching: But more especially that great Work of God, in destroying <HI>Sennacherib's</HI> Army by an Angel, for his Contempt of the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> as if he had been no more than the Gods of the Heathen.</P>
<P>When all these Things proved ineffectual, God took a new Method with the heathen World, and used, in some respects, much greater Means to convince &amp; reclaim them, than ever before. In the first Place, his People, the <HI>Jews,</HI> were removed to <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Head and Heart of the heathen World (<HI>Chaldea,</HI> having been very much the Fountain of Idolatry) to carry thither the Revelations which God had made of Himself, contained in the sacred Writings; and there to bear their Testimony against Ido∣latry; as some of them, particularly <HI>Daniel, Shadrach, Meshack</HI> and <HI>Abed-nego,</HI> did, in a very open Manner, be∣fore the King, and the greatest Men of the Empire, with such Circumstances as made their Testimony very famous in the World; God confirming it with great Miracles; which were published thro' the Empire, by Order of it's
<PB N="84" REF="008118_0104_0F6B579D6F7BBF18"/>
Monarch, as the mighty Works of the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> shewing him to be above all Gods: <HI>Daniel,</HI> that great Prophet, at the same time being exalted to be Governour of all the wise Men of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and one of the chief Of∣ficers of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI> Court.</P>
<P>After this, God raised up <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to destroy <HI>Babylon,</HI> for it's obstinate Contempt of the true God, and Injuri∣ousness towards his People; according to the Prophecies of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> speaking of him by Name, instructing him con∣cerning the Nature and Dominion of the true God. (Isai. xlv.) Which Prophecies were probably shown to him, whereby he was induced to publish his Testimony con∣cerning the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> as THE GOD. (Ezra i. 2, 3.) <HI>Daniel,</HI> about the same Time, being advanced to be prime Minister of State in the new Empire, erected under <HI>Darius,</HI> and in that Place appeared openly as a Worshipper of the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> and Him alone; God confirming his Testimony for Him, before the King, and all the Grandees of his Kingdom, by preserving him in the Den of Lions; where by <HI>Darius</HI> was induced to publish to all People, Nations and Languages, that dwelt in all the Earth, his Testimony, that <HI>the God of</HI> Israel <HI>was the living God, and stedfast for ever,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>When, after the Destruction of <HI>Babylon,</HI> some of the <HI>Jews</HI> returned to their own Land, Multitudes never re∣turned▪ but were dispersed abroad, thro' many Parts of the vast <HI>Persian</HI> Empire; as appears by the Book of <HI>Esther.</HI> And many of 'em afterwards, as good Histories inform, were removed into the more western Parts of the World: and so were dispersed as it were all over the hea∣then World, having the holy Scriptures with them, and Synagogues every where, for the Worship of the true God. And so it continued to be, to the Days of Christ and his Apostles; as appears by the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI> Thus that Light, which God had given them, was in the Providence of God, carried abroad into all Parts of the World: So that now they had far greater Advantages, to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, in Matters of Re∣ligion,
<PB N="85" REF="008118_0105_0F6B579E17FCBF40"/>
if they had been disposed to improve their Advan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages.</P>
<P>And besides all these things, from about <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Time, Learning and Philosophy increased, and was carried to a great Height. God raised up a Number of Men of pro∣digious Genius, to instruct others, and improve their Rea∣son and Understanding, in the Nature of Things: And philosophic Knowledge having gone on to increase for se∣veral Ages, seem'd to be got to it's Height before Christ came, or about that Time.</P>
<P>And now let it be considered what was the Effect of all these Things.—In Stead of a Reformation, or any Appearance or Prospect of it, the Heathen World in ge∣neral rather grew worse. As Dr.<HI>Winder</HI> observes, <Q>The inveterate Absurdities of Pagan Idolatry continued without Remedy, and increased as Arts and Learning increased; and Paganism prevailed in all it's Height of Absurdity, when Pagan Nations were polished to the Height, and in the most polite Cities and Countries; and thus continued to the last Breath of Pagan Power.</Q> And so it was with respect to Wickedness in general, as well as idolatry; as appears by what the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> observes in Rom. i.—Dr. <HI>T.</HI> speaking of the Time when the Gospel-Scheme was introduced (<HI>Key,</HI> § 257.) says▪ <Q>The moral and religious State of the Heathen was very deplorable, being generally sunk into great Ig∣norance, gross Idolatry, &amp; abominable Vice.</Q> Abomi∣nable Vices prevailed, not only among the common People, but even among their Philosophers themselves, yea, some of the chief of them, and of greatest Genius; so Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself observes, as to that detestable Vice of Sodomy, which they commonly and openly allowed and practised without Shame. See Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Note on Rom. i. 27.</P>
<P>Having thus considered the State of the Heathen World, with regard to the Effect of Means used for it's Reforma∣tion, during the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, from the first Foun∣dation of it in <HI>Abraham's</HI> Time; Let us now consider how it was with that People themselves, that were distin∣guished
<PB N="86" REF="008118_0106_0F6B579ECC62C6C0"/>
with the peculiar Privileges of that Dispensation. The Means used with the Heathen Nations, were great; but they were small, if compared with those used with the <HI>Israelites.</HI> The Advantages by which that People were distinguished, are r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>presented in Scripture as vastly above all parallel, in Passages which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> takes Notice of. (<HI>Key,</HI> § 39.) And he reckons these Privileges among those which he calls <HI>antecedent Blessings,</HI> consisting in Motives to Virtue and Obedience; and says (<HI>Key,</HI> § 51.) <Q>That this was the very End and Design of the Dispen∣sation of God's extraordinary Favours to the <HI>Jews, viz.</HI> to engage them to Duty and Obedience or that it was a Scheme for promoting Virtue, is clear beyond Dispute, from every Part of the Old Testament.</Q> Nevertheless, as has been already shown, the Generality of that People, thro' all the successive Periods of that Dispensation, were Men of a wicked Character. But it will be more abundantly manifest, how strong the natural Biass to Iniquity appeared to be among that People, by considering more particularly how things were with them from Time to Time.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the great things God had done in the Times of <HI>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,</HI> to separate them and their Posterity from the Idolatrous World, that they might be a holy People to himself; yet in about 200 Years after <HI>Jacob's</HI> Death, and in less than 150 Years after the Death of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and while some were alive that had seen <HI>Joseph,</HI> the People had in a great Measure lost the true Religion, and were apace conforming to the Heathen World: When, for a Remedy, and the more effectually to alienate them from Idols, and engage them to the God of their Fathers, God appeared to bring 'em out from a∣mong the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and separate them from the heathen World, and to reveal Himself in his Glory and Majesty, in so affecting and astonishing a Manner, as tended most deeply and durably to impress their Minds; that they might never forsake him more. But so perverse were they, that they murmured even in the Midst of the Mi∣racles
<PB N="87" REF="008118_0107_0F6B579FE1FB95C0"/>
that God wrought for 'em in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and murmured at the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> in a few Days after God had brought them out with such a mighty Hand. When he had led them thro' the Sea, <HI>they sang his Praise, but soon forgat his Works.</HI> Before they got to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> they openly manifested their Perverseness from Time to Time; so that God says of 'em, Exod. xvi. 28. <HI>How long will ye refuse to keep my Commandments, and my Laws?</HI> After∣wards they murmured again at <HI>Rephedim.</HI></P>
<P>In about two Months after they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> they came to Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> where God entered into a most solemn Covenant with the People, that they should be an holy People unto him, with such astonishing Mani∣festations of his Power, Majesty and Holiness, as were al∣together unparallel'd: As God puts the People in Mind, De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ iv. 32,—34. <HI>For ask now of the Days that are past, which were before thee, since the Day that God created Man upon the Earth; and ask from one Side of Heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great Thing is, or hath been heard like it. Did ever People hear the Voice of God speaking out of the Midst of the Fire, as thou hast heard, and live? Or hath God assayed to take him a Nation from the Midst of another Nation,</HI> &amp;c? And these great Things were to that End, to impress their Minds with such a Conviction and Sense of divine Truth, and their Obligations to their Duty, that they might never forget them: As God says, Exod. xix. 9. <HI>Lo, I come unto thee in a thick Cloud, that the People may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.</HI> But what was the Effect of all? Why, it was not more than two or three Months, before that People, there, under that very Mountain, returned to their old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Idolatry, and were singing and dancing be∣fore a golden Calf, which they had set up to worship. And after such awful Manifestations as there were of God's Displeasure for that Sin, and so much done to bring 'em to Repentance, and confirm 'em in Obedience, it was but a few Months before they came to that Vio∣lence
<PB N="88" REF="008118_0108_0F6B57A04CFA3848"/>
of Spirit, in open Rebellion against God, that with the utmost Vehemence they declared their Resolution to follow God no longer, but to make them a Captain to return into <HI>Egypt.</HI> And thus they went on in Ways of perverse Opposition to the most High, from Time to Time, repeating their open Acts of Rebellion, in the Midst of continued astonishing Miracles, till that Generation was destroyed. And tho' the following Generation seems to have been the best that ever was in <HI>Israel;</HI> yet notwith∣standing their good Example, and notwithstanding all the Wonders of God's Power and Love to that People, in <HI>Joshua's</HI> Time, how soon did that People degenerate, and begin to forsake God, and join with the Heathen in their Idolatries, till God by severe Means, and by sending Pro∣phets and Judges, extraordinarily influenced from above, reclaimed them? But when they were brought to some Reformation by such Means, they soon fell away again into the Practice of Idolatry; and so from Time to Time, from one Age to another; and nothing proved effectual for any abiding Reformation.</P>
<P>After things had gone on thus for several hundred Years, God used new Methods with his People, in two Respects; <HI>First,</HI> He raised up a great Prophet, under whom a Num∣ber of young Men were trained up in Schools, that from among them there might be a constant Succession of great Prophets in <HI>Israel,</HI> of such as God should chuse; which seems to have been continued for more than 500 Years. <HI>Secondly,</HI> God raised up a great King, <HI>David,</HI> one eminent for Wisdom, Piety and Fortitude, to subdue all their Hea∣then Neighbours, who used to be such a Snare to 'em; and to confirm, adorn and perfect the Institutions of his publick Worship; and by him to make a more full Reve∣lation of the great Salvation, and future glorious Kingdom of the Messiah. And after him, raised up his Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> the wisest and greatest Prince that ever was on Earth, more fully to settle and establish those Things which his Father <HI>David</HI> had begun, concerning the publick Worship of God in <HI>Israel,</HI> and to build a glorious Temple for the
<PB N="89" REF="008118_0109_0F6B57A104FF2108"/>
Honour of JEHOVAH, and the Institutions of his Wor∣ship, and to instruct the neighbour Nations in true Wisdom and Religion. But as to the Success of these new and extraordinary Means, if we take Dr. <HI>T.</HI> for our Expositor of Scripture, the Nation must be extremely corrupt in <HI>David's</HI> Time: for he supposes, he has respect to his own Times, in those Words, Psal. xiv. 2. 3. <HI>The Lord look∣ed down from Heaven, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God: They are all gone aside; They are together become filthy; There is none that doth Good; no, not one.</HI> But whether Dr. <HI>T.</HI> be in the right in this, or not, yet if we consider what appeared in <HI>Israel,</HI> in <HI>Absolom's</HI> &amp; <HI>Sheba's</HI> Rebellion, we shall not see Cause to think, that the greater Part of the Nation at that Day were Men of true Wisdom and Piety. As to <HI>Solomon's</HI> Time, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes, as has been already observed, that <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks of his own Times, when he says, he had found but one in a Thousand that was a thoroughly up∣right Man. However, it appears that all those great Means used to promote and establish Virtue and true Religion, in <HI>Samuel's, David's</HI> &amp; <HI>Solomon's</HI> Times, were so far from having any general abiding good Effect in <HI>Israel,</HI> that <HI>Solomon</HI> himself, with all his Wisdom, and notwithstanding the unparallel'd Favours of God to him, had his Mind corrupted, so as openly to tolerate Idolatry in the Land, and greatly to provoke God against him. And as soon as he was dead, ten Tribes of the twelve forsook the true Worship of God, and in Stead of it, open∣ly established the like Idolatry, that the People fell into at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when they made the golden Calf; and continued finally obstinate in this Apostacy, notwithstand∣ing all Means that could be used with them by the Pro∣phets, which God sent, one after another, to reprove, counsel and warn them, for about 250 Years; especially those two great Prophets, <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Elisha.</HI> Of all the Kings that reigned over them, there was not so much as one but what was of a wicked Character. And at last it came to that, that their Case seem'd utterly desperate:
<PB N="90" REF="008118_0110_0F6B57A1C1CDA798"/>
So that Nothing remain'd to be done with them, but to remove 'em out of God's Sight. Thus the Scripture re∣presents the Matter, 2 Kings xvii.</P>
<P>And as to the other two Tribes; tho' their Kings were always of the Family of <HI>David,</HI> and they were favoured in many respects, far beyond their Brethren, yet they were generally exceeding corrupt: their Kings were most of 'em wicked Men, &amp; their other Magistrates, &amp; Priests and People, were generally agreed in the Corruption. Thus the Matter is represented in the Scripture-History, and the Books of the Prophets. And when they had seen how God had cast off the ten Tribes, in Stead of taking Warn∣ing, they made themselves vas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly more vile than ever the other had done; as appears by 2 Kings xvii. 18, 19. Ezek. xvi. 46,47, 51. God indeed waited longer upon them, for his Servant <HI>David'</HI>s Sake, and for <HI>Jerusalem'</HI>s Sake, that he had chosen; and used more extraordinary Means with them; especially by those great Prophets, <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah;</HI> but to no Effect: So that at last it came to this, as the Prophets represent the Matter, that they were like a Body universally and desperately diseased and cor∣rupted, that would admit of no Cure, the whole Head sick, and the whole Heart faint, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Things being come to that Pass, God took this Method with them▪ He utterly destroyed their City and Land, and the Temple which he had among them, made thorough Work in purging the Land of 'em; as when a Man <HI>empties a Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, wipes it,&amp; turns it upside down; or when a Vessel is cast into a fierce Fire, till it's Filthiness is thoroughly burnt out.</HI> 2 Kings xxi. 13. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zek. Chap. xxiv. They were carried into Captivity, and there left till that wicked Generation was dead, and those old Rebels were purged out; that afterwards the Land might be resettled with a more pure Generation.</P>
<P>After the Return from the Captivity, and God had built the Jewish Church again in their own Land, by a series of wonderful Providences; yet they corrupted them∣selves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>in, to so great a Degree, that the Transgressors
<PB N="91" REF="008118_0111_0F6B57A315A2FC78"/>
were come the full again in the Days of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes;</HI> as the Matter is represented in the Prophecy of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. viii. 28. And then God made them the Subjects of a Dispensation, little, if any Thing, less terrible, than that which had been in <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI> Days. And after God had again delivered 'em, and re∣stored the State of Religion among them, by the Instru∣mentality of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> they degenerated again; So that when Christ came, they were arrived to that ex∣treme Degree of Corruption, which is represented in the Accounts given by the Evangelists.</P>
<P>It may be observed here in general, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> tho' so vastly distinguished with Advantages, Means and Motives to Holiness, yet are represented as coming, from Time to Time, to that Degree of Corruption and Guilt, that they were more wicked, in the Sight of God, than the very worst of the Heathen. As, of old, God sware by his Life, that the Wickedness of <HI>Sodom</HI> was small, compared with that of the <HI>Jews.</HI> Ezek. xvi. 47, 48, &amp;c. also Chap. v. 5.—10. So, Christ speaking of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in his Time, represents 'em as having much greater Guilt than the Inhabitants of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> or even <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI></P>
<P>But we are now come to the Time when the grandest Scene was displayed, that ever was open'd on Earth. After all other Schemes had been so long and so tho∣roughly tried, and had so greatly failed of Success, both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> that wonderful Dispensation was at length introduced, which was the greatest Scheme for the suppressing and restraining Iniquity among Man∣kind, that ever infinite Wisdom and Mercy contrived; even the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. <Q>A new Dis∣pensation of Grace was erected (to use Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> own Words, P. 239, 240) for the more certain, and effectual Sanctification of Mankind, into the Image of God; the delivering them from Sin and Wickedness, into which they might fall, or were already fallen; to redeem 'em from all Iniquity, and bring 'em to the Knowledge
<PB N="92" REF="008118_0112_0F6B57A3855E1988"/>
and Obedience of God.</Q> In whatever high and ex∣alted Terms the Scripture speaks of the Means &amp; Motives which the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed of old; yet their Privileges are represented as having no Glory, in Comparison of the Advantages of the Gospel. Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Words in P. 233. are worthy to be here repeated. <Q>Even the Heathen (says he) knew God, and might have glorified him as God; but under the glorious Light of the Gospel, we have very clear Ideas of the divine Perfections, and particularly of the Love of God as our Father, and as the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We see our Duty in the utmost Extent, and the most cogent Reasons to perform it: We have Eter∣nity open'd to us, even an endless State of Honour and Felicity, the Reward of virtuous Actions; and the Spi∣rit of God promised for our Direction and Assistance. And all this may and ought to be applied to the purify∣ing our Minds, and the perfecting of Holiness. And to these happy Advantages, we are born: for which we are bound for ever to praise and magnify the rich Grace of God in the Redeemer.</Q> And he elsewhere says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Key,</HI> § 139.</NOTE> <Q>The Gospel-Constitution is a Scheme the most perfect and effectual for restoring-true Religion, and promoting Virtue and Happiness, that ever the World has yet seen.</Q> And <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note on Rom.</HI> i. 16.</NOTE> <HI>admirably adapted to enlighten our Minds, and sanctify our Hearts;</HI> And <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prof. to Per. on Rom.</HI> P. 203.</NOTE> <HI>never were Motives so divine and powerful proposed, to induce us to the Practice of all Virtue and Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>And yet even these Means have been ineffectual upon the far greater Part of them with whom they have been used; of the <HI>many that have been called, few have been chosen.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Jews,</HI> God's ancient People, with whom they were used in the first Place, and used long by Christ and his Apostles, the Generality of them rejected Christ and his Gospel, with extreme Pertinaciousness of Spirit.
<PB N="93" REF="008118_0113_0F6B57A499406AA0"/>
They not only went on still in that Career of Corruption, which had been increasing from the Time of the <HI>Macca∣bees;</HI> but Christ's Coming, and his Doctrine &amp; Miracles, and the Preaching of his Followers, &amp; the glorious Things that attended the same, were the Occasion, thro' their perverse Improvement, of an infinite Increase of their Wickedness. They crucified the Lord of Glory, with the utmost Malice and Cruelty, and persecuted his Fol∣lowers; they pleased not God, and were contrary to all Men; and went on to grow worse and worse, till they filled up the Measure of their Sin, and Wrath came upon them to the uttermost; and they were destroyed, and cast out of God's Sight, with unspeakably greater Tokens of the divine Abhorrence and Indignation, than in the Days of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar.</HI> The bigger Part of the whole Na∣tion were slain, and the rest were scattered abroad thro' the Earth, in the most abject and forlorn Circumstances. And in the same spirit of Unbelief and Malice against Christ and the Gospel, and in their miserable dispersed Circumstances, do they remain to this Day.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Gentile</HI> Nations, tho' there was a glo∣rious Success of the Gospel amongst them, in the Apostles Days; yet probably not one in ten of those that had the Gospel preached to 'em, embraced it. The Powers of the World were set against it, and persecuted it with in∣satiable Malignity. And among the Professors of Christi∣anity, there presently appeared in many a Disposition to Corruption, and to abuse the Gospel unto the Service of Pride and Licentiousness. And the Apostles in their Days foretold a grand Apostacy of the Christian World, which should continue many Ages; and observed, that there appeared a Disposition to such an Apostacy, among professing Christians, even in that Day. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thess. ii. 7. And the greater Part of the Ages which have now elapsed, have been spent in the Duration of that grand and general Apostacy, under which the Christian World, as it is called, has been transformed into that which has been vastly more deformed, more dishonourable &amp; hateful to God, and
<PB N="94" REF="008118_0114_0F6B57A4C2360E28"/>
repugnant to true Virtue, than the State of the heathen World before: Which is agreeable to the prophetical Descriptions given of it by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>In these latter Ages of the Christian Church, God has raised up a Number of great and good Men, to bear Testi∣mony against the Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and by their Means introduced that Light into the World, by which, in a short Time, at least one Third Part of <HI>Europe</HI> were delivered from the more gross Enormities of <HI>Anti∣christ:</HI> Which was attended at first with a great Refor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion, as to vital and practical Religion. But how is the Gold soon become dim! To what a Pass are things come in Protestant Countries at this Day, and in our Nation in particular! To what a prodigious Height has a Deluge of Infidelity, Profaneness, Luxury, Debauchery and Wickedness, of every Kind, arisen! The poor savage <HI>Americans</HI> are meer Babes and Fools (if I may so speak) as to Proficiency in Wickedness, in Comparison of Mul∣titudes that the Christian World throngs with. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself, as was before observed, represents, that the <HI>Gene∣rosity of Christians have been the most wicked, lewd, bloody and treacherous, of all Mankind,</HI> and says (<HI>Key,</HI> § 356.) <Q>The Wickedness of the Christian World renders it so much like the Heathen, that the good Effects of our Change to Christianity are but little seen.</Q></P>
<P>And with respect to the dreadful Corruption of the present Day, it is to be considered, besides the Advantages already mentioned, that great Advances in Learning and philosophic Knowledge have been made in the present and past Century, giving great Advantage for a proper and enlarged Exercise of our rational Powers, and for our seeing the bright Manifestation of God's Per∣fections in his Works. And it is to be observed, that the Means and Inducements to Virtue, which this Age enjoys, are in Addition to most of those which were men∣tioned before, as given of old; and among other Things, in Addition to the shortening of Man's Life, to 70 or 80 Years, from near a Thousand. And with regard to this,
<PB N="95" REF="008118_0115_0F6B57A6E67F83B8"/>
I would observe, that as the Case now is in Christendom, take one with another of them that ever come to Years <HI>of</HI> Discretion, their Life is not more than forty or forty-five Years; which is but about the twentieth Parth of what it once was: And not so much in great Cities, Places where Profaneness, Sensuality and Debauchery, commonly prevail to the greatest Degree.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> (<HI>Key,</HI> § 1.) truly observes, That God has from the Beginning exercised wonderful and infinite Wisdom, in the Methods he has, from Age to Age, made use of to oppose Vice, cure Corruption, and promote Virtue in the World; and introduced several Schemes to that End. 'Tis indeed remarkable, how many Schemes and Methods were tried of old, both before and after the Flood; how many were used in the Times of the Old Testament, both with Jews and Heathens; and how ineffectual all these antient Methods proved, for 4000 Years together, till God introduced that grand Dispensation, for the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣deeming Men from all Iniquity, and purifying them so himself, a People zealous of good Works; which the Scripture represents as the Subject of the Admiration of Angels. But even this has; now so long, proved so in∣effectual, with respect to the Generality, that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> thinks <HI>there is Need of a new Dispensation; Christians being now,</HI> as he says, <HI>in a Manner reduced to a State of Re∣ligion, as low as that of Heathenism, &amp; may be ranked among the Dead; the present Light of the Gospel prov∣ing insufficient for the full Reformation of the Christian World.</HI> (Note on Rom. i. 27.)—And yet all these Things, according to him, without any natural B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to the con∣trary; no Stream of natural Inclination or Propensity at all, to oppose Inducements to Goodness; no native Op∣position of Heart, to withstand those gracious Means, which God has ever used with Mankind, from the Beginning of the World to this Day; any more than there was in the Heart of <HI>Adam,</HI> the Moment God created him in perfect Innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="008118_0116_0F6B57A806EBAEC8"/>Surely Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme is attended with strange Paradoxes. And that his mysterious Toners may appear in a true Light, it must be observed,—at the same Time while he supposes these Means, even the very grea∣test and best of 'em, to have proved so ineffectual, that Help from them, as to any general Reformation, is to be despaired of; yet he maintains, that all Mankind, even the Heathen in all Parts of the World, yea, every single Person in it (which must include every <HI>Indian</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> be∣fore the <HI>Europeans</HI> came hither; and every Inhabitant of the unknown Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>Terra Australis</HI>) has Ability, Light, and Means sufficient, to do their whole Duty▪ yet (as many Passages in his Writings, plainly suppose) to perform perfect Obedience to God's Law, without the least Degree of Vice or Iniquity. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 259, 339, 340, 348.</NOTE></P>
<P>But I must not omit to observe,—Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposed, that the Reason why the Gospel-Dispensation has been so ineffectual, is, that it has been greatly misunderstood and perverted. In P. 183. he says, <Q>Wrong Representati∣ons of the Scheme of the Gospel have greatly obscured the Glory of divine Grace, and contributed much to the Corruption of it's Professors.—Such Doctrines have been almost universally taught and received, as quite subvert it. Mistakes Notions about Nature, Grace, Election and Reprobation, Justification, Rege∣neration, Redemption, Calling, Adoption, &amp;c. have quite taken away the very Ground of the Christian Life.</Q></P>
<P>But how came the Gospel to be so universally and ex∣ceedingly misunderstood? Is it because it is in it self so very dark and unintelligible, and not adapted to the Ap∣prehension of the human Faculties? If so, how is the Possession of such an obscure and unintelligible Thing, so unspeakable &amp; glorious an Advantage?—Or is it because of the native Blindness, Corruption and Superstition of Mankind? But this is giving up the Thing in Question, and allowing a great Depravity of Nature.—And Dr. <HI>T.</HI> speaks of the Gospel as far otherwise than dark and
<PB N="97" REF="008118_0117_0F6B57A91E0D6BA0"/>
unintelligible; he represents it as exhibiting the clearest and most glorious Light, to deliver the World from Dark∣ness, and bring 'em into marvellous Light. He speaks of the Light which the <HI>Jews</HI> had, under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dis∣pensation, as vastly exceeding the Light of Nature, which the Heathen enjoyed: And yet he supposes, that even the latter was so clear, as to be sufficient to lead Men to the Knowledge of God, and their whole Duty to him. And he speaks of the Light of the Gospel as vastly ex∣ceeding the Light of the Old Testament. He says of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in particular, <Q>That he wrote with great Perspicuity; that he takes great Care to explain every Part of his Subject; that he has left no Part of it unex∣plained and unguarded; and that never was an Author more exact and cautious in this.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pref. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Par. on Rom.</NOTE>—Is it not strange therefore, that the <HI>Christian</HI> World, without any native Depravity to prejudice and darken their Minds, should be so blind in the Midst of such glaring Light, as to be all, or the Generality, agreed, from Age to Age, so essentially to <HI>misunderstand</HI> that which is made so very plain?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, P.443. <Q>'Tis my Opinion, that the Christian Religion was very early and grievously cor∣rupted, by dreaming, ignorant, superstitious <HI>Monks,</HI> too conceited to be satisfied with plain Gospel; and has long remained in that deplorable State.</Q>—But how came the whole Christian World, without any blinding Depravity, to hearken to these ignorant foolish Men, rather than unto wiser and better Teachers? Especially, when the latter had <HI>plain Gospel</HI> on their Side, &amp; the Doctrines of the other were(as our Author supposes) so very contrary not only to the plain Gospel, but to Men's Reason and common Sense! Or were all the Teachers of the Chris∣tian Church nothing but a Parcel of <HI>ignorant Dreamers?</HI> If so, this is very strange indeed, unless Mankind natu∣rally <HI>love Darkness,</HI> rather than Light,; seeing in all Parts of the Christian World, there was so great a Mul∣titude of those in the Work of the Ministry, who had the Gospel
<PB N="98" REF="008118_0118_0F6B57A944A08648"/>
Gospel in their Hands, and whose whole Business it was to study and teach it; and therefore had infinitely greater Advantages to become truly wise, than the Heathen Phi∣losophers. But if it did happen so, by some strange and inconceivable Means, that notwithstanding all these glo∣rious Advantages, all the Teachers of the Christian Church thro' the World, without any native evil Propensity, very early became silly <HI>Dreamers,</HI> and also in their <HI>dreaming,</HI> generally stumbled on the <HI>same</HI> individual monstrous Opinions, and so the World might be blinded for a while; yet why did not they hearken to that wise and great Man, <HI>Pelagius,</HI> and others like Him, when he plainly held forth the Truth to the Christian World? Especially see∣ing his Instructions were so agreeable to the plain Doc∣trines, and the bright and clear Light of the Gospel of Christ, and also so agreeable to the plainest Dictates of the common Sense and Understanding of all Mankind; but the other so repugnant to it, that (according to our Author) if they were true, it would prove <HI>Understand∣</HI> to be <HI>no Understanding,</HI> and <HI>the Word of God to be no Rule of Truth, nor at all to be relied upon, and God to be a Being worthy of no Regard!</HI></P>
<P>And besides, if the Ineffectualness of the Gospel to restrain Sin and promote Virtue, be owing to the general Prevalence of these Doctrines, which are supposed to be so absurd and contrary to the Gospel, here is this further to be accounted for; namely, Why, since there has been so great an Increase of Light in religious Matters (as must be supposed on Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme) in this and the last Age, and these monstrous Doctrines of Original Sin, Elec∣tion, Reprobation, Justification, Regeneration, &amp;c. have been so much exploded, especially in our Nation, there has been no Reformation attending this great Advancement of Light and Truth: But on the contrary, Vice &amp; every thing that is opposite to practical Christianity, has gone on to increase, with such a prodigious Celerity, as to become like an overflowing Deluge, threatning, unless God mer∣cifully interposes, speedily to swallow up all that is left of what is virtuous and praise-worthy.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="008118_0119_0F6B57AA0EF03030"/>Many other Things might have been mentioned under this Head, of the <HI>Means</HI> which Mankind have had to restrain Vice, and promote Virtue; such as—Wickedness being many Ways contrary to Men's temporal Interest and Com∣fort in this World, and their having continually before their Eyes so many instances of Persons made miserable by their Vices; the Restraints of human Laws, without which Men cannot live in Society; the Judgments of God brought on Men for their Wickedness, with which History abounds, and the providential Rewards of Virtue; and innumerable particular Means, that God has used from Age to Age, to curb the Wickedness of Mankind, which I have omitted. But there would be no End of a par∣ticular Enumeration of such Things. Enough has been said. They that will not be convinced by the Instances which have been mentioned, probably would not be con∣vinced, if the World had stood a Thousand Times so long, and we had the most authentick and certain Accounts of Means having been used from the Beginning, in a Thou∣sand Times greater Variety; and new Dispensations had been introduced, after others had been tried in vain, ever so often, and still to little Effect. He that won't be con∣vinced by a Thousand good Witnesses, 'tis not likely that he would be convinced by a Thousand Thousand. The Proofs that have been extant in the World, from Trial and Fact, of the Depravity of Man's Nature, are inex∣pressible, and as it were infinite, beyond the Representa∣tion of all Comparison and Similitude. If there were a Piece of Ground, which abounded with Briars &amp; Thorns, or some poisonous Plant, and all Mankind had used their Endeavours, for a Thousand Years together, to suppress that evil Growth, &amp; to bring that Ground by Manure and Cultivation, Planting and Sowing, to produce better Fruit, but all in vain, it would still be over-run with the same noxious Growth; it would not be a Proof, that such a Produce was agreeable to the Nature of that Soil, in any wise to be compared to that which is given in divine Pro∣vidence, that Wickedness is a Produce agreeable to the

Nature of the Field of the World of Mankind; which has ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Means used with it, that have been so various, great and wonderful, contrived by the unsearchable and boundless Wisdom of God; Medicines procured with infi∣nite Expence, exhibited with so vast an Apparatus; so marvellous a Succession of Dispensations, introduced one after another, displaying an incomprehensible Length and Breadth, Depth and Height, of divine Wisdom, Love and Power, and every Perfection of the Godhead, to the eternal Admiration of the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places.</P>

<HEAD>Several <HI>Evasions</HI> of the Arguments for the Depra∣vity of Nature, from Trial and Events, considered.</HEAD>
<P>E<HI>Vasion</HI> I. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, P. 231, 232. <Q><HI>Adam'</HI>s Nature, it is allowed, was very far from being sinful; yet he sinned. And therefore, the common Doctrine of Original Sin, is no more necessary to ac∣count for the Sin that hath been in the World, than it is to account for <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin.</Q> Again, P. 328, &amp;c. <Q>If we allow Mankind to be as wicked as R. R. has re∣presented them to be; and suppose that there is not one upon Earth that is truly righteous, &amp; without Sin, and that some are very enormous Sinners, yet it will not thence follow, that they are naturally corrupt.—For, if sinful Action infers a Nature originally corrupt, then, whereas <HI>Adam</HI> (according to them that hold the Doctrine of Original Sin) committed the most heinous and aggravated Sin, that ever was committed in the World; for, according to them, he had greater Light than any other Man in the World, to know his Duty, and greater Power than any other Man to fulfil it, and was under greater Obligations than any other Men to Obedience; he sinned when he knew he was the Re∣presentative
<PB N="101" REF="008118_0121_0F6B57ABF53C0188"/>
of Millions, and that the happy or mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣able State of all Mankind depended on his Conduct; which never was, nor can be, the Case of any other Man in the World:—then, I say, it will follow, that <HI>his</HI> Nature was originally <HI>corrupt,</HI> &amp;c.—Thus, their Argument from the Wickedness of Mankind, to prove a sinful and corrupt Nature, must inevitably and irrecoverably fall to the Ground.—Which will appear more abundantly, if we take in the Case of the Angels; who in Numbers sinned and kept not their first Estate, tho' created with a Nature su∣periour to <HI>Adam'</HI>s.</Q> Again, P. 421. <Q>When it is enquired, how it comes to pass that our Appetites and Passions are now so irregular and strong, as that not one Person has resisted them, so as to keep himself pure and innocent? If this be the Case, if such as make the Enquiry will tell the World, how it came to pass that <HI>Adam'</HI>s Appetites and Passions were so irregular and strong, that he did not resist them, so as to keep him∣self pure and innocent, when upon their Principles he was far more able to have resisted them; I also will tell them how it comes pass, that his Posterity don't resist them. Sin doth not alter it's Nature, by it's being general; and therefore, how far soever it spreads, it must come upon all just as it came upon <HI>Adam.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These Things are delivered with much Assurance. But is there any Reason in such a Way of Talking? One Thing implied in it, and the main Thing, if any Thing at all to the Purpose, is, that because an Effect's being general don't alter the Nature of the Effect, therefore Nothing more can be argued concerning the Cause, from it's happening constantly, and in the most steady Manner, than from it's happening but once. But how contrary is this to Reason? If such a Case should happen, that a Person, thro' the deceitful Persuasions of a pretended Friend, once takes an unwholsom &amp; poisonous Draught, of a Liquor which he had no Inclination to before; but after he has once taken of it, he be observed to act as one that
<PB N="102" REF="008118_0122_0F6B57AC50F85088"/>
has an insatiable, incurable Thirst after more of the same, in his constant Practice, &amp; Acts often repeated, &amp; obstinately continued in as long as he lives, against all possible Argu∣ments and Endeavours used to dissuade him from it; and we should from hence argue a fixed Inclination, and be∣gin to suspect that this is the Nature and Operation of the Poison, to produce such an Inclination, or that this strong Propensity is some Way the Consequence of the first Draught; in such a Case, could it be said with good Rea∣son, that a fix'd Propensity can no more be argued from his consequent <HI>constant</HI> Practice, than from his <HI>first</HI> Draught? Or, if we suppose a young Man, no otherwise than soberly inclined, and enticed by wicked Companions, should drink to Excess, until he had got a Habit of ex∣cessive Drinking, and should come under the Power of a greedy Appetite after strong Drink, so that Drunkenness should become a common and constant Practice with him: And some Observer, arguing from this his general Practice, should say, 'It must needs be, that this young Man has a fix'd Inclination to that Sin; otherwise, how should it come to pass that he should make such a Trade of it?' And another, ridiculing the Weakness of his arguing, should reply, <Q>Do you tell me how it came to pass, that he was guilty of that Sin the first Time without a fix'd Inclination, and I'll tell you how he is guilty of it so generally without a fix'd Inclination. Sin don't alter it's Nature by being general: And therefore, how common soever it becomes, it must come at all Times by the same Means that it came at first.</Q> I leave it to every one to judge, who would be chargeable with weak arguing in such a Case.</P>
<P>'Tis true, as was observed before, there is no Effect without some Cause, Occasion, Ground or Reason of that Effect, and some Cause answerable to the Effect. But certainly it will not follow from thence, that a <HI>transient</HI> Effect requires a <HI>permanent</HI> Cause, or a fix'd Influence or Propensity. An Effect's happening once, tho' the Effect may be great, yea, tho' it may come to pass on the same
<PB N="103" REF="008118_0123_0F6B57AEA3974460"/>
Occasion in many Subjects at the same Time, will not prove any fix'd Propensity, or permanent Influence. 'Tis true, it proves an Influence great and extensive, answerable to the Effect, <HI>once</HI> exerted, or once effectual; but it proves Nothing in the Cause <HI>fix'd</HI> or constant. If a particular Tree, or a great Number of Trees standing together, have blasted Fruit on their Branches at a particular Season, yea if the Fruit be very much blasted, and entirely spoiled, it is evident that something was the Occasion of such an Effect at that Time; but this alone don't prove the <HI>Na∣ture</HI> of the Tree to be bad. But if it be observed, that those Trees, and all other Trees of the Kind, wherever planted, and in all Soils, Countries, Climates and Seasons, and however cultivated and managed, still bear ill Fruit, from Year to Year, and in all Ages, it is a good Evidence of the evil Nature of the Tree: And if the Fruit, at all these Times, and in all these Cases, be very bad, it proves the Nature of the Tree to be very bad. And if we argue in like Manner from what appears among Men, 'tis easy to determine, whether the universal Sinfulness of Mankind, and their all sinning immediately, as soon as capable of it, and all sinning continually, and generally being of a wicked Character, at all Times, in all Ages, and all Places, and under all possible Circumstances, against Means and Motives inexpressibly manifold and great, and in the utmost conceivable Variety, be from a permanent internal great Cause.</P>
<P>If the Voice of common Sense were attended to, and heard, there would be no Occasion for Labour in multi∣plying Arguments, and Instances, to shew, that one Act don't prove a fix'd Inclination; but that constant Practice and Pursuit does. We see that it is in Fact agreeable to the Reason of all Mankind, to argue fix'd Principles, Tempers and prevailing Inclinations, from repeated and continued Actions, tho' the Actions are voluntary, and per∣formed of Choice; and thus to judge of the Tempers and Inclinations of Persons, Ages, Sexes, Tribes and Nations. But is it the Manner of Men to conclude, that whatever
<PB N="104" REF="008118_0124_0F6B57B0B3B87698"/>
they see others once do, they have a fix'd abiding Inclination to do?—Yea, there may be several Acts seen, and yet they not taken as good Evidence of an established Propensity; nay, tho' attended with that Circumstance, that one Act, or those several Acts are followed with such constant Practice, as afterwards evidences fix'd Disposition. As for Example; there may be several Instances of a Man's drinking some spirituous Liquor, and they be no Sign of a fix'd Inclination to that Liquor: But these Acts may be introductory to a settled Habit or Propensity, which may be made very manifest afterwards by constant Practice.</P>
<P>From these things it is plain, that what is alledged con∣cerning the first Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> and of the Angels, without a previous fix'd Disposition to Sin, can't in the least injure or weaken the Arguments which have been brought to prove a fix'd Propensity to Sin in Mankind in their pre∣sent State. The Thing which the Permanence of the Cause has been argued from, is the Permanence of the Effect. And that the permanent Cause consists in an in∣ternal fix'd Propensity, and not any particular external Circumstances, has been argued from the Effect's being the same, thro' a vast Variety and Change of Circumstan∣ces. Which Things don't take Place with respect to the first Act of Sin that <HI>Adam</HI> or the Angels were guilty of; which first Acts, considered in themselves, were no per∣manent continued Effects. And tho' a great Number of the Angels sin'd, and the Effect on that Account was the greater, and more extensive; yet this <HI>Extent</HI> of the Effect is a very different Thing from that <HI>Permanence,</HI> or settled Continuance of the Effect, which is supposed to shew a permanent Cause, or fix'd Influence or Propensity. Nei∣ther was there any Trial of a vast Variety of Circumstan∣ces attending a permanent Effect, to shew the fix'd Cause to be internal, consisting in a settled Disposition of Nature, in the Instances objected. And however great the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> or of the <HI>Angels,</HI> was, and however great Means, Motives and Obligations they sin'd against; whatever may be thence argued concerning the transient Cause, Occasion
<PB N="105" REF="008118_0125_0F6B57B0CE107AA8"/>
or Temptation, as being very subtil, remarkably tending to deceive and seduce, or otherwise great; yet it argues nothing of any <HI>settled</HI> Disposition, or <HI>fix'd</HI> Course at all, either great or small; the Effect both in the Angels, and our first Parents, being in it self <HI>transient,</HI> and for ought appears, happening in each of them, under one System or Coincidence of influential Circumstances.</P>
<P>The general continued Wickedness of Mankind, against such Means and Motives, proves each of these Things, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Cause is <HI>fix'd,</HI> and that the fix'd Cause is <HI>internal,</HI> in Man's Nature, and also that it is very <HI>powerful.</HI> It proves the <HI>first,</HI> namely, that the Cause is fix'd, because the Effect is so abiding, thro' so many Changes. It proves the <HI>second,</HI> that is, that the fix'd Cause is internal, because the Circumstances are so various: The Variety of Means and Motives is one Thing that is to be refer'd to the Head of Variety of Circumstances; and they are that Kind of Circumstances, which above all others proves this; for they are such Circumstances as can't possibly cause the Effect, being most opposite to the Effect in their Tendency. And it proves the <HI>third, viz.</HI> the Greatness of the inter∣nal Cause, or the Powerfulness of the Propensity; because the Means which have opposed it's Influence, have been so great, and yet have been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edly overcome.</P>
<P>But here I may observe by the Way, that with regard to the Motives and Obligations which our first Father sin'd against, it is not reasonably alledged, that he sin'd when he knew his Sin would have destructive Con∣sequences to all his Posterity, <HI>and might, in Process of Time, pave the whole Globe with Skulls,</HI> &amp;c. Seeing 'tis so evident, by the plain Account the Scripture gives us of the Temptation which prevailed with our first Parents to commit that Sin, that it was so contrived by the Subtilty of the Tempter, as first to blind and deceive 'em as to that Matter, and to make them believe that their Disobedience should be followed with <HI>no Destruction or Calamity at all</HI> to themselves (and therefore not to their Posterity)
<PB N="106" REF="008118_0126_0F6B57B18BB8D2F0"/>
but on the contrary, with a great Increase and Advancement of Dignity and Happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Evasion</HI> II. Let the Wickedness of the World be ever so general and great, there is no Necessity of supposing any Depravity of Nature to be the Cause: Man's own <HI>Free-Will</HI> is Cause sufficient. Let Mankind be more or less corrupt, they make themselves corrupt, by their own free Choice. This Dr. <HI>T.</HI> abundantly insists upon, in many Parts of his Book. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 257, 258, 328, 329, 344, 421, 422, and many other Places.</NOTE></P>
<P>But I would ask, how it comes to pass that Mankind so universally agree in this evil Exercise of their Free-Will? If their Wills are in the first Place as free to Good as Evil, what is it to be ascribed to, that the World of Mankind consisting of so many Millions, in so many suc∣cessive Generations, without Consultation, all agree to exer∣cise their Freedom in Favour of Evil? If there be no natural Tendency or Preponderation in the Case, then there is as good a Chance for the Will's being determined to Good as Evil. If the Cause is indifferent, why is not the Effect in some Measure indifferent? If the Balance be no heavier at one End than the other, why does it per∣petually and as it were infinitely preponderate one Way? How comes it to pass, that the Free-Will of Mankind has been determined to Evil, in like Manner before the Flood, and after the Flood; under the Law, and under the Gos∣pel; among both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> under the Old Testament; and since that, among <HI>Christians, Jews, Ma∣hometans;</HI> among Papists and Protestants; in those Na∣tions where Civility, Politeness, Arts and Learning most prevail, and among the <HI>Negroes &amp; Hottentots</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> towards both the Poles, and on every Side of the Globe; in greatest Cities, and obscurest Villages; in Palaces, and in Hutts, Wigwams and Cells under Ground? Is it enough, to re∣ply, It happens so, that Men every where, and at all Times chuse thus to determine their own Wills, and so to make themselves sinful, as soon as ever they are capable of it,
<PB N="107" REF="008118_0127_0F6B57B242CAD418"/>
and to sin constantly as long as they live, and universally to chuse never to come up half Way to their Duty?</P>
<P>As has been often observed, a steady Effect requires a steady Cause; but Free-Will, without any previous Pro∣pensity, to influence it's Determinations, is no permanent Cause; Nothing can be conceived of, further from it: For the very Notion of Freedom of Will consisting in self-determining Power, implies Contingence: And if the Will is free in that Sense, that it is perfectly free from any Government of previous Inclination, it's Freedom must imply the most <HI>absolute</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> Contingence: And surely Nothing can be conceived of, more unfix'd than that. The Notion of Liberty of Will, in this Sense, implies perfect Freedom from every Thing that should previously fix, bind or determine it; that it may be left to be fix'd and determin'd wholly by itself: There∣fore, it's Determinations must be previously altogether unfix'd. And can that which is so unfixed, so contingent, be a Cause sufficient to account for an Effect, in such a Manner, and to such a Degree, permanent, fix'd and constant?</P>
<P>When Men see only one particular Person going on in a certain Course with great Constancy, against all Manner of Means to dissuade him, do they judge this to be no Argument of any fix'd Disposition of Mind, because he being free may determine to do so, if he will, without any such Disposition? Or if they see a Nation or People that differ greatly from other Nations, in such and such In∣stances of their constant Conduct, as tho' their Tempers and Inclinations were very diverse, and any should deny it to be from any such Cause, and should say, We can't judge at all of the Temper or Disposition of any Nation or People by any thing observable in their constant Practice or Behaviour, because they have all Free-Will, and there∣fore may all chuse to act so, if they please, without any thing in their Temper or Inclination to biass 'em; would such an Account of such Effects be satisfying to the Rea∣son of Mankind?—But infinitely further would it be from
<PB N="108" REF="008118_0128_0F6B57B31221AD88"/>
satisfying a considerate Mind, to account for the constant and universal Sinfulness of Mankind, by saying, that the Will of all Mankind is free, and therefore all Mankind may, if they please, make themselves Wicked: They are free when they first begin to act as moral Agents, and therefore all may, if they please, begin to sin as soon as they begin to act: They are free as long as they continue to act in the World; and therefore they may all commit Sin continually, if they will: Men of all Nations are free, and therefore all Nations may act alike in these Respects, if they please (tho' some don't know how other Nations do act)—Men of high and low Condition, learned and ignorant, are free; and therefore they may agree in acting Wickedly, if they please (tho' they don't consult together)—Men in all Ages are free, and therefore Men in one Age may all agree with Men in every other Age in Wickedness, if they please (tho' they don't know how Men in other Ages have acted) &amp;c. &amp;c. Let every one judge whether such an Account of Things can satisfy Reason.</P>
<P><HI>Evasion</HI> III. 'Tis said by many of the Opposers of the Doctrine of Original Sin, that the Corruption of the World of Mankind may be owing, not to a depraved Na∣ture, but to bad <HI>Example.</HI> And I think we must under∣stand Dr. <HI>T.</HI> as having respect to the powerful Influence of bad Instruction and Example, when he says, P. 118. <Q>The Gentiles in their Heathen State, when incorpo∣rated into the Body of the Gentile World, were with∣out Strength, unable to help or recover themselves.</Q> And in several other Places to the like Purpose. If there was no Depravity of Nature, what else could there be but bad Instruction and Example, to hinder the Heathen World, as a collective Body, (for as such Dr. <HI>T.</HI> speaks of 'em, as may be seen P. 117, 118.) from emerging out of their Corruption, on the Rise of each new Generation? As to their bad Instruction, our Author insists upon it, that the Heathen, notwithstanding all their Disadvantages, had sufficient Light to know God, and do their whole Duty
<PB N="109" REF="008118_0129_0F6B57B3CA9DF4E0"/>
to him, as we have observed from Time to Time. There∣fore it must be chiefly bad Example, that we must sup∣pose, according to him, render'd their Case helpless.</P>
<P>Now concerning this Way of accounting for the Cor∣ruption of the World, by the Influence of bad Example, I would observe the following Things:</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis accounting for the Thing by the Thing itself. It is accounting for the Corruption of the World by the Corruption of the World. For, that bad Examples are general all over the World to be followed by others, &amp; have been so from the Beginning, is only an Instance, or rather a Description of that Corruption of the World which is to be accounted for. If Mankind are naturally no more inclined to Evil than Good, then how comes there to be so many more bad Examples, than good ones, in all Ages? And if there are not, how come that bad Examples that are set, to be so much more followed, than the good? If the Propensity of Man's Nature be not to Evil, how comes the Current of general Example, every where, and at all Times, to be so much to Evil? And when Opposition has been made by good Examples, how comes it to pass that it has had so little Effect to stem the Stream of general wicked Practice?</P>
<P>I think, from the brief Account the Scripture gives us of the Behaviour of the first Parents of Mankind, the Expressions of their Faith and Hope in God's Mercy re∣vealed to them, we have Reason to suppose, that before every they had any Children, they repented, and were pardoned, and became truly pious. So that God planted the World at first with a <HI>noble Vine;</HI> and at the Begin∣ning of the Generations of Mankind, he set the Stream of Example the right Way. And we see, that Children are more apt to follow the Example of their Parents, than of any others; especially in early Youth, their forming Time, when those Habits are generally contracted, which abide by them all their Days. And besides, <HI>Adam'</HI>s Chil∣dren had no other Examples to follow, but those of their Parents. How therefore came the Stream so soon to
<PB N="110" REF="008118_0130_0F6B57B48133D0C8"/>
turn, and to proceed the contrary Way, with so violent a Current? Then, when Mankind became so universally and desperately corrupt, as not to be fit to live on Earth any longer, and the World was every where full of bad Examples, God destroyed 'em all at once, but only righ∣teous <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Family, to remove those bad Ex∣amples, and that the World of Mankind might be planted again with good Example, and the Stream again turned the right Way: How therefore came it to pass, that <HI>Noah'</HI>s Posterity did not follow his good Example, especially when they had such extraordinary Things to enforce his Ex∣ample, but so generally, even in his Life-time, became so exceeding Corrupt? One would think, the first Genera∣tions at least, while all lived together as one Family, under <HI>Noah,</HI> their venerable Father, might have followed his good Example: And if they had done so, then, when the Earth came to be divided in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g'</HI>s Time, the Heads of the several Families would have set out their particular Colonies with good Examples, and the Stream would have been turned the right Way in all the various Divisions, Colonies and Nations of the World. But we see verily the Fact was, that in about fifty Years after <HI>Noah'</HI>s Death the World in general was over-run with dreadful Corrup∣tion; so that all Virtue and Goodness was like soon to perish from among Mankind, unless something extraordi∣nary should be done to prevent it.</P>
<P>Then, for a Remedy, God separated <HI>Abraham</HI> and his Family from all the rest of the World, that they might be delivered from the Influence of bad Example, that in his Posterity he might have a holy Seed. Thus God again planted a <HI>noble Vin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Abraham, Isaac &amp; Jacob,</HI> being eminently pious. But how soon did their Posterity degenerate, till true Religion was like to be swallowed up? We see how desperately, and almost universally cor∣rupt they were, when God brought 'em out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and led them in the Wilderness.</P>
<P>Then God was pleased, before he planted his People <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naan,</HI> to destroy that perverse Generation in the
<PB N="111" REF="008118_0131_0F6B57B5992FB930"/>
Wilderness, that he might plant 'em there a <HI>noble Vine, wholly a right Seed,</HI> and set 'em out with good Example, in the Land where they were to have their settled Abode. Jer. ii. 21. It is evident, that the Generation which came with <HI>Joshua</HI> into <HI>Canaan,</HI> was an excellent Generation, by innumerable Things said of 'em. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jer. ii. 2, 3. Psal. lxvili. 14. Josh. xxil. 2. and xxii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8. Deut. iv. 3, 4. Hos. xi. 1. and ix. 10. Judg. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 7, 17, 22. and many other Places.</NOTE> But how soon did that People, nevertheless, become <HI>the degenerate Plant of a strange Vine?</HI></P>
<P>And when the Nation had a long Time proved them∣selves desperately and incurably corrupt, God destroyed them, and sent 'em into Captivity, till the old Rebels were dead and purged out, to deliver their Children from their evil Example: And when the following Generation were purified as in a Furnace, God planted 'em again, in the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> a <HI>noble Vine,</HI> and set 'em out with good Example; which yet was not followed by their Posterity.</P>
<P>When again the Corruption was become inveterate and desperate, the Christian Church was planted by a glorious Out-pouring of the Spirit of God, causing true Virtue and Piety to be exemplified in the first Age of the Church of Christ, far beyond whatever had been on Earth before; and the Christian Church was planted a <HI>noble Vine.</HI> But that primitive good Example has not prevailed, to cause Virtue to be generally and stedfastly maintained in the Christian World: To how great a Degree it has been otherwise, has already been observed.</P>
<P>After many Ages of general and dreadful Apostacy, God was pleased to erect the Protestant Church, as sepa∣rated from the more corrupt Part of Christendom; and true Piety flourished very much in it at first; God planted it a <HI>noble Vine:</HI> But notwithstanding the good Examples of the first Reformers, what a melancholy Past is the Pro∣testant World come to at this Day?</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="008118_0132_0F6B57B601E1F6D0"/>When <HI>England</HI> grew very corrupt, God brought over a Number of pious Persons, &amp; planted 'em in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> and this Land was planted with a <HI>noble Vine.</HI> But how is the Gold become dim! How greatly have we forsaken the pious Examples of our Fathers!</P>
<P>So prone have Mankind always proved themselves to Degeneracy, and bent to Backsliding. Which shews plainly their natural Propensity; and that when Good had revived, and been promoted among Men, it has been by some divine Interposition, to oppose the natural Current; the Fruit of some extraordinary Means, the Efficacy of which has soon been overcome by constant natural Biass, and the Effect of good Example presently lost, and Evil has regain'd and maintain'd the Dominion: Like an heavy Body, which may by some great Power be caused to as∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, against it's Nature, a little while, but soon goes back again towards the Center, to which it naturally and con∣stantly tends.</P>
<P>So that evil Example will in no wise account for the Corruption of Mankind, without supposing a natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Sin. The Tendency of Example alone will not account for general wicked Practice, as conse∣quent on good Example. And if the Influence of bad Example is a Reason of some of the Wickedness that is in the World, that alone will not account for Men's becoming worse than the Example set, and degenerating more and more, and growing worse and worse, which has been the Manner of Mankind.</P>
<P N="2">2. There has been given to the World an Example of Virtue, which, were it not for a dreadful Depravity of Nature, would have Influence on them that live under the Gospel, far beyond all other Examples; and that is the Example of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>God, who knew the human Nature, and how apt Men are to be influenced by Example, has made answerable Provision. His infinite Wisdom has contrived that we should have set before us the most amiable and perfect Example, in such Circumstances as should have the greatest
<PB N="113" REF="008118_0133_0F6B57B6D13D3158"/>
Tendency to influence all the Principles of Man's Nature, but his Corruption. Men are apt to be moved by the Example of others <HI>like themselves,</HI> or in their own Na∣ture; therefore this Example was given in our Nature. Men are ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> follow the Examples of the <HI>great</HI> and honourable: and this Example, tho' it was of one in our Nature, yet it was of one infinitely higher and more ho∣nourable than Kings or Angels. A People are apt to follow the Example of their Prince: This is the Ex∣ample of that glorious Person, who stands in a peculiar Relation to Christians, as their Lord &amp; King, the supream Head of the Church; and not only so but the King of Kings, supream Head of the Universe, and Head over all Things to the Church. Children are apt to follow the Example of their Parents: This is the Example of the Author of our Being, and one who is in a peculiar and extraordinary Manner our Father, as he is the Author of our holy and happy Being; besides his being the Creator of the World, and everlasting Father of the Universe. Men are very apt to follow the Example of their Friends: The Example of Christ is of one that is infinitely our greatest Friend, standing in the most endearing Relations of our Brother, Redeemer, spiritual Head and Husband: whose Grace and Love expressed to us, transcends all other Love and Friendship, as much as Heaven is higher than the Earth. And the Virtues and Acts of his Example were exhibited to us in the most endearing and engaging Circumstances that can possibly be conceived of: His Obedience and Submission to God, his Humility. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k∣ness, Patience, Charity, Self-D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nial, &amp;c. being exercised and expressed in a Work of infinite Grace, Love, Conde∣scension and Beneficence to us; and had all their highest Expression in his laying down his Life for us, and meek∣ly, patiently and cheerfully undergoing such extreme and unutterable Suffering, for our eternal Salvation. Men are peculiarly apt to follow the Example of such as they have great Benefits from: But it is utterly impossible to con∣ceive of greater Benefits, that we could have by the Vir∣tues
<PB N="114" REF="008118_0134_0F6B57B780F8E2D8"/>
of any Person, than we have by the virtuous Acts of Christ; who depend upon being thereby saved from eter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Destruction, and brought to inconceivable immortal Glory at God's right Hand. Surely if it were not for an extreme Corruption of the Heart of Men, such an Ex∣ample would have that strong Influence on the Heart, that would as it were swallow up the Power of all the evil and hateful Examples of a Generation of Vipers.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Influence of bad Example, without Corruption of Nature, will not account for Children's universally com∣mitting Sin as soon as capable of it; which, I think, is a Fact that has been made evident by the Scripture. It will not account for this, in the Children of eminently pious Parents; the first Examples, that are set in their View, being very good; which, as has been observed, was espe∣cially the Case of many Children in Christian Families in the Apostles Days, when the Apostle <HI>John</HI> supposes that every individual Person had Sin to repent of, and confess to God.</P>
<P N="4">4. What Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes to have been Fact with respect to great Part of Mankind, cannot consistently be accounted for from the Influence of bad Example, <HI>viz.</HI> the State of the Heathen World, which he supposes, considered as a collective Body, was helpless, dead in Sin, and unable to recover it self. Not evil Example alone, no, nor as united with evil Instruction, can be supposed a sufficient Reason why every new Generation that arose among them, should not be able to emerge from the Idolatry and Wickedness of their Ancestors, in any Consistence with his Scheme. The ill Example of Ancestors could have no Power to oblige them to sin, any other Way than as a strong Temp∣tation. But Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself says, P. 348. <Q>To suppose Men's Temptations to be superiour to their Powers, will impeach the Goodness and Justice of God, who appoints every Man's Trial.</Q> And as to bad Instructi∣ons, as was observed before, he supposes that they all, yea every individual Person, had Light sufficient to know God, and do their whole Duty. And if each one could do this
<PB N="115" REF="008118_0135_0F6B57BA22760968"/>
for Himself, then surely they might all be agreed in it thro' the Power of Free-Will, as well as the whole World be agreed in Corruption by the same Power.</P>
<P><HI>Evasion</HI> IV. Some modern Opposers of the Doctrine of Original Sin do thus account for the general Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣valence of Wickedness, <HI>viz.</HI> that in a Course of Nature our Senses grow up first, and the animal Passions get the Start of Reason. So Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Mor. Phil.</HI> P. 270. and <HI>Chris. Phil.</HI> P. 274.</NOTE> <Q>Sensitive Objects first affect us, and in as much as Reason is a Principle, which, in the Nature of Things, must be ad∣vanced to Strength and Vigour, by gradual Cultivation, and their Objects are continually assailing and soliciting us; so that, unless a very happy Education prevents, our sensitive Appetites must have become very Strong, before Reason can have Force enough to call them to an Account, and assume Authority over them.</Q> From hence Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> supposes it comes to pass, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Phil.</HI> P. 282, 283.</NOTE> <Q>That tho' some few may, thro' the Influence of virtuous Ex∣ample, be said to be sanctified from the Womb, so libe∣ral, so generous, so virtuous, so truly noble is their Cast of Mind; yet, generally speaking, the whole World lieth in such Wickedness, that, with respect to the far greater Part of Mankind, the Study of Virtue is begin∣ning to reform, and is a severe Struggle against bad Habits, early contracted, and deeply rooted; it is there∣fore putting off an old inveterate corrupt Nature, and putting on a new Form and Temper; it is moulding our selves a-new; it is a being born again, and becoming as Children.—And how few are there in the World, who escape it's Pollutions, so as not to be early in that Class, or to be among the Righteous that need no Re∣pentance?</Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> tho' he is not so explicit, seems to hint at the same Thing, P. 192. <Q>'Tis by slow Degrees (says he) that Children come to the Use of Understanding; the animal Passions being for some Years the governing Part
<PB N="116" REF="008118_0136_0F6B57BB45527510"/>
of their Constitution. And therefore, tho' they may be froward and apt to displease us, yet how far this is Sin in them, we are not capable of judging. But it may suffice to say, that 'tis the Will of God that Children should have Appetites and Passions to regulate and re∣strain, that he hath given Patents Instructions and Com∣mands to discipline and inform their Minds, that if Pa∣rents first learned true Wisdom for themselves, and then endeavoured to bring up their Children in the Way of Virtue, there would be less Wickedness in the World.</Q></P>
<P>Concerning these Things I would observe, that such a Scheme is attended with the very same Difficulties, which they that advance it would avoid by it; liable to the same Objections, which they make against God's ordering it so that Men should be brought into Being with a prevailing Propensity to Sin. For this Scheme supposes, the Author of Nature has so ordered Things, that Men should come into Being as moral Agents, that is, should first have Ex∣istence in a State and Capacity of mora Agency, under a prevailing Propensity to Sin. For that Strength, which sensitive Appetites and animal Passions come to by their habitual Exercise, before Persons come to the Exercise of their rational Powers, amounts to a strong Propensity to Sin, when they first come to the Exercise of those ratio∣nal Powers, by the Supposition: because this is given as a Reason why the Scale is turned for Sin among Man∣kind, and why, <HI>generally speaking, the whole World lies in Wickedness, and the Study of Virtue is a severe Strug∣gle against bad Habits, early contracted, and deeply rooted.</HI> These deeply rooted Habits must imply a Ten∣dency to Sin; otherwise they could not account for that which they are brought to account for, namely, prevail∣ing Wickedness in the World: For that Cause can't ac∣count for an Effect, which is supposed to have no <HI>Ten∣dency</HI> to that Effect. And this <HI>Tendency</HI> which is sup∣posed, is altogether Equivalent to a <HI>natural Tendency:</HI> 'Tis as necessary to the Subject. For it is supposed to be brought on the Person who is the Subject of it, when he
<PB N="117" REF="008118_0137_0F6B57BC024DDBE8"/>
has no Power to withstand or oppose it: The Habit, as Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> says, becoming very strong, before Reason can have Force enough to call the Passions to Account, or assume Authority over them. And 'tis supposed, that this Necessity, by which Men become subject to this Pro∣pensity to Sin, is from the Ordering and Disposal of the Author of Nature; and therefore must be as much from his Hand, and as much without the Hand of the Person himself, as if he were first brought into Being with such a Propensity. Moreover, it is supposed that the Effect, which the Tendency is <HI>to,</HI> is truly <HI>Wickedness.</HI> For 'tis alledg∣ed as a Cause or Reason why the whole World lies in <HI>Wickedness,</HI> and why all but a very few are first in the Class of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> and not among the Righteous that need no Repentance. If they need Repentance, what they are guilty of is truly &amp; properly Wickedness, or moral Evil; for certainly Men need no Repentance for that which is no Sin, or blameable Evil. If it be so, that as a Consequence of this Propensity, the World lies in Wickedness, and the far greater Part are of a wicked Character, without Doubt, the far greater Part go to eter∣nal Perdition: For Death don't pick and choose, only for Men of a righteous Character. And certainly that is an evil corrupt State of Things, which naturally tends to, and issues in that Consequence, that as it were the whole World lies and lives in Wickedness, and dies in Wicked∣ness, and perishes eternally. And this by the Supposition is a State of Things wholly of the Ordering of the Au∣thor of Nature, before Mankind are capable of having any Hand in the Affair. And is this any Relief to the Difficulties, which these Writers object against the Doctrine of natural Depravity?</P>
<P>And I might here also observe, that this Way of ac∣counting for the Wickedness of the World, amounts to just the same Thing with that Solution of Man's Depra∣vity, which was mentioned before, that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> cries out of as too gross to be admitted, (P. 188, 189.) <HI>viz.</HI> God's creating the Soul pure, and putting it into such a Body,
<PB N="118" REF="008118_0138_0F6B57BCCBF6ED60"/>
as naturally tends to pollute it. For this Scheme sup∣poses, that God creates the Soul pure, and puts it into a Body, and into such a State in that Body, that the natural Consequence is a strong Propensity to Sin, as soon as the Soul is capable of sinning.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> seems to suppose, that the Matter could not have been ordered otherwise, consistent with the Na∣ture of Things, than that animal Passions should be so aforehand with Reason, as that the Consequence should be that which has been mentioned; because Reason is a Faculty of such a Nature, that it can have Strength and Vigour no otherwise than by Exercise and Culture. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mor. Phil.</HI> P. 311.</NOTE> But can there be any Force in this? Is there any Thing in Nature, to make it impossible, but that the superiour Prin∣ciples of Man's Nature should be so proportioned to the inferiour, as to prevent such a dreadful Consequence, as the moral and natural Ruin, and eternal Perdition of the far greater Part of Mankind? Could not those superiour Principles be in vastly greater Strength at first, and yet be capable of endless Improvement? And what should hinder it's being so ordered by the Creator, that they should im∣prove by vastly swifter Degrees than they do? If we are Christians, we must be forced to allow it to be possible in the Nature of Things, that the Principles of human Na∣ture should be so balanced, that the Consequence should be no Propensity to Sin, in the first Beginning of a Capa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of moral Agency; because we must own, that it was so in Fact in <HI>Adam,</HI> when first created, and also in the Man Christ Jesus; tho' the Faculties of the latter were such as grew by Culture and Improvement, so that he in∣creased in Wisdom, as he grew in stature.</P>
<P><HI>Evasion</HI> V. Seeing Men in this World are in a State of Trial, it is fit that their Virtue should meet with Trials, and consequently that it should have Opposition &amp; Temp∣tation to overcome; not only from without, but from with∣in, in the animal Passions &amp; Appetites we have to struggle with; that by the Conflict and Victory our Virtue may
<PB N="119" REF="008118_0139_0F6B57BE06233678"/>
be refined &amp; established. Agreeable to this Dr.<HI>T.</HI> (P. 253.) says, <Q>Without a right Use and Application of our Powers, were they naturally ever so perfect, we could not be judged fit to enter into the Kingdom of God.—This gives a good Reason why we are now in a State of Trial and Temptation, <HI>viz.</HI> to prove and discipline our Minds, to season our Virtue, and to fit us for the Kingdom of God; for which, in the Judgment of infinite Wisdom, we cannot be qualified, but by overcoming our present Temptations.</Q> And in P. 354. he says, <Q>We are upon Trial, and it is the Will of our Father that our Constitution should be attended with various Passions and Appetites, as well as our outward Condition with vari∣ous Temptations.</Q> He says the like in several other Places. To the same Purpose very often Dr. <HI>Turnbull:</HI> particularly, <HI>Chris. Phil.</HI> P. 310. <Q>What Merit (says he) except from Combat? What Virtue without the En∣counter of such Enemies, such Temptations as arise both from within, and from abroad? To be virtuous, is to prefer the Pleasures of Virtue, to those which come into Competition with it, and Vice holds forth to tempt us; and to dare to adhere to Truth and Goodness, what∣ever Pains &amp; Hardships it may cost. There must there∣fore, in Order to the Formation and Trial, in Order to the very Being of Virtue, be Pleasures of a certain Kind to make Temptations to Vice.</Q></P>
<P>In Reply to these Things I would say, either the State of Temptation which is supposed to be ordered for Men's Trial, amounts on the whole to a prevailing Tendency to that State of general Wickedness and Ruin, which has been proved to take Place, or it does not. If it does not amount to a Tendency to such an Effect, then how does it account for it? When it is enquired, by what Cause such an Effect should come to pass, is it not absurd to alledge a Cause, which is own'd at the same Time to have no Tendency to such an Effect? Which is as much as to confess, that it will not account for it. I think, it has been demonstrated that this Effect must be owing to some prevailing Ten∣dency.
<PB N="120" REF="008118_0140_0F6B57BE53FDD7F8"/>
If the other Part of the Dilemma be taken, and it be said, that this State of Things does imply a prevailing Tendency to that Effect which has been proved, <HI>viz.</HI> that all Mankind, without the Exception of so much as one, sin against God, to their own deserved and just eternal Ruin; and not only so, but sin thus immediately, as soon as capable of it, and sin continually, and have more Sin than Virtue, and have Guilt that infinitely outweighs the Value of all the Goodness any ever have, and that the Generality of the World in all Ages are extremely stupid and foolish, and of a wicked Character, and actually perish forever; I say, if the State of Temptation implies a na∣tural Tendency to such an Effect as this, it is a very evil, corrupt and dreadful State of Things, as has been already largely shewn.</P>
<P>Besides, such a State has a Tendency to defeat it's own supposed End, which is to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, ripen and perfect Virtue in Mankind, and so to fit Men for the greater eternal Happiness and Glory: Whereas, the Effect it tends to, is the Reverse of this, <HI>viz.</HI> general, eternal Infamy and Ruin, in all Generations. 'Tis supposed, that Men's Virtue must have Passions and Appetites to struggle with, in order to have the Glory and Reward of Victory: but the Conse∣quence is, a prevailing, continual, and generally effectual Tendency, not to Men's Victory <HI>over evil Appetites and Passions,</HI> and the glorious Reward of that Victory, but to the Victory of evil Appetites and Lusts <HI>over Men,</HI> and utte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and eternally destroying them. If a Trial of Vir∣tue be requisite, yet the Question is, Whence comes so ge∣neral a failing in the Trial, if there be no Depravity of Nature? If Conflict &amp; War be necessary, yet surely there is no Necessity that there should be more Cowards than good Soldiers; unless it be necessary that Men should be overcome and destroyed: Especially is it not necessary that the whole World as it were should lie in Wickedness, and so lie and die in Cowardice.</P>
<P>I might also here observe, that Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> is not very consistent, in supposing, that Combat with Temptation is
<PB N="121" REF="008118_0141_0F6B57BF30942840"/>
requisite to the <HI>very Being</HI> of Virtue. For I think it clear∣ly follows from his own Notion of Virtue, that Virtue must have a Being prior to any virtuous or praise-worthy Combat with Temptation. For by his Principles, all Virtue lies in good Affection, and no Actions can be vir∣tuous, but what proceed from good Affection. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chris. Phil.</HI> P. 113, 114, 115.</NOTE> There∣fore, surely the Combat it self can have no Virtue in it, unless it proceeds from virtuous Affection: And there∣fore Virtue must have an Existence before the Combat, and be the Cause of it.</P>

<HEAD>Universal Mortality proves Original Sin; particularly the Death of Infants, with it's various Circumstances.</HEAD>
<P>THE universal Reign of <HI>Death,</HI> over Persons of all Ages indiscriminately, with the awful Circumstances and Attendants of Death, proves that Men come sinful into the World.</P>
<P>It is needless here particularly to enquire, Whether God has not a sovereign Right to set Bounds to the Lives of his own Creatures, be they sinful, or not; and as he gives Life, so to take it away when he pleases? Or how far God has a Right to bring extreme Suffering and Calamity on an innocent moral Agent? For Death, with the Pains and Agonies with which it is usually brought on, is not meerly a limiting of Existence, but is a most ter∣rible Calamity; and to such a Creature as Man, capable of conceiving of Immortality, and made with so earnest a Desire after it, and capable of Foresight &amp; of Reflection on approaching Death, and that has such an extreme Dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of it, is a Calamity above all others terrible, to such as
<PB N="122" REF="008118_0142_0F6B57BFCDC223F8"/>
are able to reflect upon it. I say, 'tis needless, elaborately to consider, whether God may not, consistent with his Per∣fections, by absolute Sovereignty, bring so great a Cala∣mity on Mankind when perfectly innocent. It is suffici∣ent, if we have good Evidence from Scripture, that 'tis not agreeable to God's Manner of dealing with Mankind, so to do.</P>
<P>'Tis manifest, that Mankind were not originally sub∣jected to this Calamity: God brought it on them after∣wards, on Occasion of Man's Sin, at a Time of the Mani∣festation of God's great Displeasure for Sin, and by a De∣nunciation and Sentence pronounced by him, as acting the Part of a Judge; as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> often confesses. Sin entred into the World,&amp;Death by Sin, as the Apostle says. Which certainly leads us to suppose, that this Affair was ordered of God, not meerly by the Sovereignty of a Creator, but by the Righteousness of a Judge. And the Scripture e∣very where speaks of all great Afflictions and Calamities, which God in his Providence brings on Mankind, as Testi∣monies of his Displeasure for Sin, in the Subject of those Calamities; excepting those Sufferings which are to attone for the Sins of others. He ever taught his People to look on such Calamities as his <HI>Rod, the Rod of his Anger,</HI> his <HI>Frowns,</HI> the <HI>Hidings of his Face</HI> in Displeasure. Hence such Calamities are in Scripture so often called by the Name of <HI>Judgments,</HI> being what God brings on Men as a <HI>Judge,</HI> executing a righteous Sentence for Transgression: Yea, they are often called by the Name of <HI>Wrath,</HI> espe∣cially Calamities consisting or issuing in Death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Levit. x. 6. Num. i. 53. and xviii. 5. Josh. ix. 20. 2 Chron. xxiv. 18. and xix. 2, 10. and xxviii. 13. and xxxii. 25. Ezra vii. 23. Neh. xiii. 18. Zech▪ vii. 12. and many other Places.</NOTE> And hence also is that which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> would have us take so much Notice of, that sometimes in the Scripture, Calamity and Suffering is called by such Names as <HI>Sin, Iniquity, being guilty,</HI> &amp;c. which is evidently by a Metonymy of the Cause for the Effect. 'Tis not likely, that in the Lan∣guage
<PB N="123" REF="008118_0143_0F6B57C08725ECF0"/>
in Use of old among God's People, Calamity or Suffering would have been called even by the Names of Sin and Guilt, if it had been so far from having any Con∣nection with Sin, that even Death itself, which is always spoken of as the most terrible of Calamities, is not so much as any Sign of the Sinfulness of the Subject, or any Testi∣mony of God's Displeasure for any Guilt of his, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes.</P>
<P>Death is spoken of in Scripture as the chief of Calami∣ties, the most extreme and terrible of all those natural Evils, which come on Mankind in this World. <HI>Deadly Destruction</HI> is spoken of as the most terrible Destruction. 1 Sam. v. 11. <HI>Deadly Sorrow,</HI> as the most extreme Sor∣row. Isai. xvii. 11. Matt. xxvi. 38. and <HI>deadly Enemies,</HI> as the most bitter and terrible Enemies. Psal. xvii. 9. The Extremity of Christ's Sufferings is represented by his Suffering <HI>unto Death.</HI> Philip. ii. 8. and other Places. Hence the greatest Testimonies of God's Anger for the Sins of Men in this World, have been by inflicting Death: As on the Sinners of the old World, on the Inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> on <HI>Onan, Pharaoh</HI> and the <HI>Egyp∣tians, Nadab</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Korah</HI> and his Company, and the rest of the Rebels in the Wilderness, on the wicked In∣habitants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> on <HI>Hophni</HI> &amp; <HI>Phinebas, Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> upon whom Wrath came to the uttermost in the Time of the last Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> This Calamity is often spoken of as in a peculiar Manner the Fruit of the Guilt of Sin. Exod. xxviii. 43. <HI>That they bear not Iniquity and</HI> die. Levit. xxii. 9. <HI>Lest they bear Sin for it and</HI> die. So Num. xviii. 22. compared with Levit. x. 1, 2. The very Light of Nature, or Tradition from antient Revelation, led the Heathen to conceive of Death as in a peculiar Manner an Evidence of divine Vengeance. Thus we have an Ac∣count, Acts xxviii. 4. That <HI>when the Barbarians saw the venomous Beast hang on</HI> Paul's <HI>Hand, they said among themselves, No Doubt this Man is a Murderer, whom tho' he hath escaped the Seas, yet</HI> Vengeance suffereth not to live.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="008118_0144_0F6B57C141E32398"/>Calamities that are very small in Comparison of the u∣niversal temporal Destruction of the whole World of Man∣kind by Death, are spoken of as manifest Indications of God's great Displeasure for the Sinfulness of the Subject; such as the Destruction of particular Cities, Countries or Numbers of Men, by War or Pestilence. Deut. xxix. 24. <HI>All Nations shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this Land? what meaneth the Heat of this great Anger?</HI> Here compare Deut. xxxii. 30. 1 Kings. ix. 8. and Jer. xxii. 8, 9. These Calamities, thus spoken of as plain Testimonies of God's great Anger, consisted only in hastening on that Death, which otherwise, by God's Dis∣posal, would most certainly come in a short Time. Now the taking off of 30 or 40 Years from 70 or 80 (if we should suppose it to be so much, one with another, in the Time of these extraordinary Judgments) is but a small Matter, in Comparison of God's first making Man mortal, cutting off his hoped for Immortality, subjecting him to inevitable Death, which his Nature so exceedingly dreads; and afterwards shortening his Life further, by cutting off more than 800 Years of it: So bringing it to be less than a twelfth Part of what it was in the first Ages of the World. Besides that innumerable Multitudes in the com∣mon Course of Things, without any extraordinary Judg∣ment, die in Youth, in Childhood and Infancy. There∣fore how inconsiderable a Thing is the additional or hasten'd Destruction, that is sometimes brought on a particular City or Country by War, compared with that universal Havock which Death makes of the whole Race of Mankind, from Generation to Generation, without Distinction of Sex, Age, Quality or Condition, with all the infinitely various dis∣mal Circumstances, Torments and Agonies which attend the Death of old and young, adult Persons and little In∣fants? If those particular and comparatively trivial Cala∣mities, extending perhaps not to more than the thousandth Part of the Men of one Generation, are clear Evidences of God's great Anger; certainly this universal vast De∣struction, by which the whole World in all Generations
<PB N="125" REF="008118_0145_0F6B57C246497770"/>
is swallowed up, as by a Flood, that Nothing can resist, must be a most glaring Manifestation of God's Anger for the Sinfulness of Mankind. Yea, the Scripture is express in it, that it is so. Psal. xc. 3, &amp;c. <HI>Thou turnest Man to Destruction, &amp; sayst, Return, ye Children of Men.—Thou carriest them away as with a Flood: They are as a Sleep: In the Morning they are like Grass, which groweth up; in the Morning it flourisheth and groweth up; in the Evening it is cut down and withereth. For we are con∣sumed by thine Anger, &amp; by thy Wrath are we troubled. Thou hast set our</HI> Iniquities <HI>before hee, our secret</HI> Sins <HI>in the Light of thy Countenance. For all our Days are passed away in thy</HI> Wrath: <HI>We spend our Years as a Tale that is told. The Days of our Years are Three∣score Years and ten: and if by Reason of Strength, they be Fourscore Years, yet is their Strength Labour and Sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we flie away. Who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noweth the Power of thine</HI> Anger? <HI>According to thy Fear, so is thy Wrath. So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts to Wisdom.</HI> How plain and full is this Testimony, that the general Mortality of Mankind is an Evidence of God's Anger for the Sin of those who are the Subjects of such a Dispensation?</P>
<P><HI>Abimelech</HI> speaks of it as a Thing which he had Rea∣son to conclude from God's Nature and Perfection, <HI>that he would not stay a righteous Nation.</HI> Gen. xx. 4.

all earthly Things, and tend to excite sober Reflections, and to induce us to be moderate in gratifying the Appe∣tites of the Body, and to mortify Pride &amp; Ambition, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 21, 67, and other Places.</NOTE> To this I would say.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis not denied but God may see it needful for Mankind in their present State, that they should be mortal, and subject to outward Afflictions, to restrain their Lusts, and mortify their Pride and Ambition, &amp;c. But then is it not an Evidence of Man's Depravity, that it is so? Is it not an Evidence of Distemper of Mind, yea, strong Dis∣ease, when Man stands in Need of such sharp Medicines, such severe and terrible Means to restrain his Lusts, keep down his Pride, and make him willing to be obedient to God? It must be because of a corrupt and ungrateful Heart, if the Riches of God's Bounty, in bestowing Life and Prosperity, and Things comfortable &amp; pleasant won't engage the Heart to God, and to Virtue and child-like Love and Obedience, but that he must always have the Rod held over him, and be often chastised, and held under the Apprehensions of Death, to keep him from running wild, in Pride, Contempt &amp; Rebellion, ungratefully using the Blessings dealt forth from his Hand, in sinning against him, and serving his Enemies. If Man has no natural Disingenuity of Heart, it must be a mysterious Thing in∣deed, that the sweet Blessings of God's Bounty have not as powerful an Influence to restrain him from sinning a∣gainst God, as terrible Afflictions. If any thing can be a Proof of a perverse and vile Disposition, this must be a Proof of it, that Men should be most apt to forget and de∣spise God, when his Providence is most kind; and that they should need to have God chastise them with great Severi∣ty, and even to kill them, to keep them in Order. If we were as much disposed to Gratitude to God for his Bene∣fits, as we are to Anger at our fellow-Creatures for Inju∣ries, as we must be (so far as I can see) if we are not of a depraved Heart, the Sweetness of the divine Bounty, if continued in Life, and the Height of every Enjoyment

that is pleasant to innocent human Nature, would be as powerful Incentives to a proper Regard to God, tending as much to promote Religion and Virtue, as to have the World fill'd with Calamity, and to have God (to use the Language of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Isai. xxxviii. 13. describing Death and it's Agonies) <HI>as a Lion, breaking all our Bones and from Day even to Night, making an End of us.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself P. 252. says, <Q>That our first Parents before the Fall were placed in a Condition proper to engage their Gratitude, Love and Obedience.</Q> Which is as much as to say, proper to engage them to the Exercise and Practice of all Religion. And if the paradisaical State was proper to engage to all Religion and Duty, and Men still come into the World with Hearts as good as the two first of the Species, why is it not proper to engage 'em to it still? What need of so vastly changing Man's State, de∣priving him of all those Blessings, and in Stead of them allotting to him a World full of Briars and Thorns, Af∣fliction, Calamity and Death, to engage him to it? The taking away of Life, and all those pleasant Enjoyments Man had at first, by a permanent Constitution, would be no stated Benefit to Mankind, unless there were a stated Dis∣position in them to abuse such Blessings. The taking them away is supposed to be a Benefit under the Notion of their being Things that tend to lead Men to Sin: but they would have no such Tendency, at least in a stated Manner, unless there were in Men a fix'd Tendency to make that unreasonable Improvement of 'em. Such a Temper of Mind as amounts to a Disposition to make such an Improvement of Blessings of that Kind, is often spoken of in Scripture, as most astonishingly vile and perverse. So concerning <HI>Israel's</HI> abusing the Blessings of <HI>Canaan,</HI> that Land flowing with Milk and Honey; their Ingratitude in it is spoken of by the Prophets, as enough to astonish all Heaven and Earth, and as more than brutish Stupidity and Vileness. Jer. ii. 7. <HI>I brought 'em into a plentiful Country, to eat the Fruit there of, and the Goodness there∣of.

If Death be brought on Mankind only as a Benefit, and in that Manner which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> mentions, <HI>viz.</HI> to mor∣tify, or moderate their carnal Appetites &amp; Affections, wean 'em from the World, excite 'em to sober Reflections, and lead 'em to the Fear and Obedience of God, &amp;c.—is it not strange, that it should fall so heavy on Infants, who are not capable of making any such Improvement of it; so that many more of Mankind suffer Death in Infancy, than in any other equal Part of the Age of Man? Our Author some∣times hints, that the Death of Infants may be for the good of Parents, and those that are adult, and may be for the Correction and Punishment of the Sins of Parents: But hath God any Need of such Methods to add to Parents Afflictions? Are there not Ways enough that he might increase their Trouble, without destroying the Lives of such Multitudes of those that are perfectly innocent, and have in no respect any Sin belonging to 'em; on whom Death comes, at an Age, when not only the Subjects are not capable of any Reflection, or making any Improvement of it, either in the Suffering, or Expectation of it; but also at an Age, when Parents and Friends, who alone can make a good Improvement, &amp; whom Dr.<HI>T.</HI> supposes alone to be punished by it, suffer least by being bereaved of them; tho' the Infants themselves sometimes suffer to great Extremity?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="129" REF="008118_0149_0F6B57C89DA5F358"/>3. To suppose, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> does, that Death is brought on Mankind in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, not at all as a Calamity, but only as a Favour and Benefit, is contrary to the Doctrine of the Gospel; which teaches, that when Christ, as the second <HI>Adam,</HI> comes to remove and destroy that Death, which came by the first <HI>Adam,</HI> he finds it not as a Friend, but an Enemy. 1 Cor. xv. 22. "For as in <HI>Adam</HI> all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive:" with v. 25.&amp;26. <HI>For he must reign, till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet. The last ENEMY that shall be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stoyed, is</HI> Death.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> urges, that the Afflictions which Mankind are subjected to, and particularly their common Mortality, are represented in Scripture as the Chastisements of our hea∣venly Father; and therefore are designed for our spiritual Good: and consequently are not of the Nature of Pun∣ishments. So in P. 68, 69, 314, 315.</P>
<P>Tho' I think the Thing asserted far from being true, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Scripture represents the Afflictions of Man∣kind in general, and particularly their common Mortality, as the Chastisements of an heavenly Father; yet 'tis need∣less to stand to dispute that Matter: For if it be so, it will be no Argument that the Afflictions and Death of Man∣kind are not Evidences of their Sinfulness. Those would be strange Chastisements from the Hand of a wise and good Father, which are wholly for Nothing; especially such se∣vere Chastisements, as to break the Child's Bones; when at the same Time the Father don't suppose any Guilt, Fault or Offence, in any respect, belonging to the Child; but it is chastised in this terrible Manner, only for fear that it will be faulty hereafter. I say, these would be a strange Sort of Chastisements; yea, tho' he should be able to make it up to the Child afterwards. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> tells of Representations made by the whole Current of Scripture: I am certain, it is not agreable to the Currrent of Scrip∣ture, to represent divine fatherly Chastisements after this Manner. 'Tis true, that the Scripture supposes such Chastenings to be the Fruit of God's Goodness; yet at the same Time it evermore represents them as being for
<PB N="130" REF="008118_0150_0F6B57C8C72BDC78"/>
the Sin of the Subject, and as Evidences of the divine Displeasure for it's Sinfulness. Thus the Apostle in 1 Cor. xi. 30, 31, 32. speaks of God's chastening his Peo∣ple by mortal Sickness, for their Good, <HI>that they might not be condemned with the World,</HI> and yet signifies that it was <HI>for their Sin;</HI> FOR THIS CAUSE <HI>many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep:</HI> that is, for the Profaneness and sinful Disorder before-mentioned. So <HI>Eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u</HI> Job xxxiii. 16. &amp;c. speaks of the same <HI>Chastening</HI> by Sickness, as for Men's Good; <HI>to withdraw Man from his</HI> sinful <HI>Purpose, and to hide Pride from Man, and keep back his Soul from the Pit;</HI> that <HI>therefore God chastens Man with Pain on his Bed, and the Multitude of his Bones with strong Pain.</HI> But these Chastenings are for his Sins, as appears by what follows, v 28. Where 't<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s observed, that when God by this Means has brought Men to <HI>repent,</HI> and humbly <HI>confess their Sins,</HI> he delivers them. Again, the same <HI>Eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u,</HI> speaking of the unfailing Love of God to the Righteous, even when he <HI>chastens them,</HI> and <HI>they are bound in Fetters, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olden in Cords of Affliction,</HI> Chap. xxxvi. 7, &amp;c; yet speaks of these Chastenings as being for their Sins, v 9. <HI>Then he sheweth them their Work, and their Transgressions, that they have exceeded.</HI> So <HI>David,</HI> Psal. xxx. speaks of God's <HI>Chasten∣ing</HI> by sore Afflictions, as being for his Good, and issuing joyfully; and yet being the Fruit of God's Anger for his Sin. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 5. <HI>God's ANGER endureth but for a Moment,</HI> &amp;c.—Compare Psal cxix. 67, 71 75. God's fatherly Chastisements are spoken of as being for Sin, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> vii. 14, 15. <HI>I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son. If he commit</HI> Iniquity, <HI>I will chasten him with the Rod of Men, and with the Stripes of the Children of Men; but my Mercy shall not depart away from him.</HI> So the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> speaks of the great Affliction that God's People of the young Generation suffered in the Time of the Capti∣vity, as being for their Good. <HI>Lam.</HI> iii. 25, &amp;c. But yet these Chastisements are spoken of as being for their Sin; see especially v 39, 40. So Christ says, Rev. ii. 19. <HI>As
<PB N="131" REF="008118_0151_0F6B57C98A5A8728"/>
many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.</HI> But the Words following shew, that these Chastenings from Love are for Sin that should be repented of: <HI>Be zealous therefore, and repent.</HI> And tho' Christ tells us, they are blessed that are persecuted for Righteousness Sake, and have Reason to rejoyce and be exceeding glad; yet even the Persecu∣tions of God's People, as ordered in divine Providence, are spoken of as divine Chastenings for Sin, like the just Corrections of a Father, when the Children deserve them, Heb. xii. The Apostle there speaking to the Christians, concerning the Persecutions which they suffered, calls their Sufferings by the Name of divine <HI>Rebukes;</HI> which implies testifying <HI>against a Fault:</HI> And that they mayn't be dis∣couraged, puts them in Mind, that <HI>whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourgeth every Son that he receiveth.</HI> 'Tis also very plain, that the Persecutions of God's People, as they are from the disposing Hand of God, are Chastise∣ments for Sin, from 1 Pet. iv. 17, 18. compared with Prov. xi. 31. See also Psal. lxix. 4,—9.</P>
<P>If divine Chastisements in general are certain Evidences that the Subjects are not wholly without Sin, some Way belonging to them, then in a peculiar Manner is Death so; For these Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Because slaying, or delivering to Death, is often spoken of as in general a more awful Thing than the Chastisements that are endured in this Life. So, Psal. cxviii. 17, 18. <HI>I shall not die, but live, and declare the Works of the Lord. The Lord hath ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sten'd me sore; but he hath not given me over unto Death.</HI> So the Psalm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Psal. lxxxviii. 15. setting forth the Extremity of his Af∣fliction, represents it by this, that it was next to Death. <HI>I am afflicted, &amp;ready to die,—while I suffer thy Terrors, I am distracted.</HI> So <HI>David,</HI> 1 Sam. xx. 3. So God's Ten∣derness towards Persons under Chastisement, is from Time to Time set forth by that, that he did not proceed so far as to make an End of 'em by Death; as in Psal. lxxviii. 38, 39. and Psal. ciii. 9. with v 14, 15. Psal. xxx. 2, 3, 9. Job xxxiii▪ 22, 23, 24. So we have God's People often
<PB N="132" REF="008118_0152_0F6B57CA83489768"/>
praying, when under great Affliction, that God would not proceed to this, as being the greatest Extremity. Psal. xiii. 3. <HI>Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God; lighten mine Eyes, lest I sleep the Sleep of Death.</HI> So Job x. 9. Psal. vi. 1,—5. &amp; lxxxviii. 9, 10, 11. cxliii. 7.</P>
<P>Especially may Death be look'd upon as the most ex∣treme of all temporal Sufferings, when attended with such dreadful Circumstances, and extreme Pains, as those with which Providence sometimes brings it on <HI>Infants;</HI> as on the Children that were offered up to <HI>Moloch,</HI> and some other Idols, who were tormented to Death in burning Brass. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, P. 359, &amp; 404. <Q>The Lord of all Being can never want Time and Place and Power to compensate abundantly any Sufferings Infants now un∣dergo in Subserviency to his good Providence.</Q> But there are no Bounds to such a License, in evading Eviden∣ces from Fact. It might as well be said, that there is not and cannot be any such thing as Evidence, from Events, of God's Displeasure; which is most contrary to the whole Current of Scripture, as may appear in Part from Things which have been observed. This Gentleman might as well go further still, and say, that God may cast guiltless Persons into Hell-Fire, to remain there in the most unutter∣able Torments for Ages of Ages (which bear no greater Pro∣portion to Eternity than a Quarter of an Hour) and if he does so, it is no Evidence of God's Displeasure; be∣cause he can never want Time, Place and Power, abun∣dantly to compensate their Sufferings afterwards. If it be so, it is not to the Purpose, as long as the Scripture does so abundantly teach us to look on great Calamities &amp; Suffer∣ings which God brings on Men, especially Death, as Marks of his Displeasure for Sin, and for Sin belonging to them that suffer.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Another Thing, which may well lead us to suppose Death, in a peculiar Manner, above other temporal Sufferings, intended as a Testimony of God's Displea∣sure for Sin, is, that Death is a Thing attended with that awful Appearance, that gloomy and terrible Aspect, that
<PB N="133" REF="008118_0153_0F6B57CB0B7AB880"/>
naturally suggests to our Minds God's awful Displeasure. Which is a Thing that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself takes particular Notice of, P. 69. Speaking of Death,<Q>Herein, says he, have we before our Eyes a striking Demonstration, that Sin is infinitely hateful to God, and the Corruption and Ruin of our Nature.—Nothing is more proper than such a Sight to give us the utmost Abhorrence of all Iniquity, &amp;c.</Q> Now if Death be no Testimony of God's Displeasure for Sin, no Evidence that the Subject is looked upon, by him who inflicts it, as any other than per∣fectly innocent, free from all Manner of Imputation of Guilt, and treated only as an Object of Favour, is it not strange, that God should annex to it such affecting Appear∣ances of his Hatred and Anger for Sin, more than to other Chastisements? which yet the Scripture teaches us are al∣ways for Sin. These gloomy &amp; striking Manifestations of God's Hatred of Sin attending Death, are equivalent to awful Frowns of God attending the Stroke of his Hand. If we should see a wise and just Father chastising his Child, mixing terrible Frowns with severe Strokes, we should justly argue, that the Father considered his Child as having some∣thing in him displeasing to him, and that he did not thus treat his Child only under a Notion of mortifying him, and preventing his being faulty hereafter, and making it up to him afterwards, when he had been perfectly innocent, and without Fault, either of Action or Disposition hitherto.</P>
<P>We may well argue from these Things, that Infants are not looked upon by God as Sinless, but that they are by Nature Children of Wrath, seeing this terrible Evil comes so heavily on Mankind in Infancy. But-besides these Things, which are observable concerning the Mortality of Infants in general, there are some particular Cases of the Death of Infants, which the Scripture sets before us, that are attended with Circumstances, in a peculiar Manner, giving Evidences of the Sinfulness of such, and their just Exposedness to divine Wrath. As particularly,</P>
<P>The destroying the Infants in <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the neigh∣bouring Cities: which Cities, destroyed in so extraordinary
<PB N="134" REF="008118_0154_0F6B57CBC5FC16D8"/>
miraculous and awful a Manner, are set forth as a signal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x∣ample of God's dreadful Vengeance for Sin to the World in all Generations; agreable to that of the Apostle, <HI>Jude</HI> v 7. God did not reprove, but manifestly countenanced <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> when he said with Respect to the Destruction of <HI>Sodom</HI> (Gen xviii. 23, 25.) <HI>Wilt thou destroy the Righteous with the Wicked?—That be far from thee, to do after this Manner, to slay the Righteous with the Wicked, &amp; that the Righteous should be as the Wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not, the Judge of all the Earth do right? Abraham's</HI> Words imply that God would not destroy the <HI>innocent</HI> with the <HI>guilty.</HI> We may well understand <HI>innocent</HI> as included in the Word <HI>righteous,</HI> according to the Language usual in Scripture, in speaking of such Cases of Judgment &amp; Pun∣ishment; as is plain in Gen. xx. 4. Exod. xxiii. 7. Deut. xxv. 1. 2 Sam. iv. 11. 2 Chron. vi. 23. and Prov. xviii. 5. Eliphaz says, Job iv. 7. <HI>Who ever perished, being</HI> innocent? <HI>or where were the</HI> righteous <HI>cut off?</HI> We see what great Care God took that <HI>Lot</HI> should not be involv'd in that Destruction. He was miraculously rescued by Angels, sent on Purpose; who laid hold on him, and bro't him, and set him without the Gates of the City; and told him that they could do Nothing till he was out of the Way. <HI>Gen.</HI> xix. 22. And not only was he thus miracu∣lously delivered, but his two wicked Daughters for his Sake. The whole Affair, both the Destruction, and the Rescue of them that escaped, was miraculous: And God could as easily have delivered the Infants which were in those Cities. And if they had been without Sin, their perfect Innocency, one should think, would have pleaded much more strongly for them, than those lewd Women's Relation to <HI>Lot</HI> pleaded for them. When in such a Case, we must suppose these Infants much further from deserv∣ing to be involved in that Destruction, than even <HI>Lot</HI> himself. To say here, that God could make it up to those Infants in another World, must be an insufficient Reply. For so he could as easily have made it up to <HI>Lot,</HI> or to <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>fifty righteous,</HI> if they had been destroyed in the same Fire:
<PB N="135" REF="008118_0155_0F6B57CC8661D5B8"/>
Nevertheless it is plainly signified, that this would not have been agreable to the wise and holy Proceedings of <HI>the Judge of all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Since God declared, that if there had been found but ten righteous in <HI>Sodom,</HI> he would have spared the whole City for their Sake, may we not well suppose, if Infants are perfectly innocent, that he would have spared the <HI>old World,</HI> in which there were, without Doubt, many Hun∣dred Thousand Infants, and in general, one in every Fa∣mily, whose perfect Innocence pleaded for it's Preserva∣tion? Especially when such vast Care was taken to save <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family (some of whom, one at least, seem to have been none of the best) that they might not be in∣volved in that Destruction. If the perfect Sinlesness of Infants had been a Notion entertain'd among the People of God of old, in the Ages next following the Flood, handed down from <HI>Noah</HI> and his Children, who well knew that vast Multitudes of Infants perished in the Flood, is it likely that <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> who lived within a few Generations of <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> would have said to <HI>Job,</HI> as he does in that foremention'd Job iv. 7. <HI>Who ever perished, being innocent? &amp; when were the Righteous cut off?</HI> Especially since in the same Discourse (Chap. v. 1.) he appeals to the Tradition of the Antients for a Confirmation of this very Point; as he also does in Chap. xv. 7,—10. and xxii. 15, 16. In which last Place, he mentions that very Thing, the Destruction of the Wicked by the Flood, as an Instance of that perishing of the Wicked, which he supposes to be peculiar to them, for <HI>Job's</HI> Conviction; in which <HI>the Wicked were cut down out of Time, their Foundation being overflown with a Flood.</HI> Where 'tis also observable, that he speaks of such an <HI>Untimeliness</HI> of Death as they suffered by the Flood, as one Evidence of Guilt; as he also does, Chap. xv. 32, 33. <HI>It shall be accomplished be∣fore his Time;</HI> and <HI>his Branch shall not be green.</HI> But those that were destroyed by the Flood in Infancy, above all the rest were <HI>cut down out of Time;</HI> when in Stead of living above 900 Years, according to the common Pe∣riod
<PB N="136" REF="008118_0156_0F6B57CDAF351540"/>
of Man's Life, many were cut down before they were one Year old.</P>
<P>And when God executed Vengeance on the antient In∣habitants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> not only did he not spare their Cities and Families for the sake of the Infants that were therein, nor take any Care that they should not be involved in the Destruction; but often with particular Care repeated his express Commands, that their Infants should not be spared, but should be utterly destroyed, without any Pity; while <HI>Rahab</HI> the <HI>Harlot</HI> (who had been far from Innocence, tho' she expressed her Faith in entertaining, and safely dismissing the Spies) was preserved, and all her Friends for her sake. And when God executed his Wrath on the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by slaying their first born, tho' the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> who were most of 'em wicked Men, as was before shewn, were wonderfully spared by the destroying Angel, yet such first born of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> as were Infants, were not spared. They not only were not rescued by the Angel, and no Miracle wrought to save 'em (as was observed in the Case of the Infants of <HI>Sodom</HI>) but the Angel destroy'd 'em by his own immediate Hand, and a Miracle was wro't to kill them.</P>
<P>Here not to stay to be particular concerning the Com∣mand by <HI>Moses,</HI> concerning the Destruction of the Infants of the <HI>Midianites,</HI> Num. xxxi. 17. And that given to <HI>Saul</HI> to destroy all the Infants of the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 3. and what is said concerning <HI>Edom,</HI> Psal. cxxxvii. 4. <HI>Happy shall he be that shall take thy little ones, and dash them against the Stones.</HI>—I proceed to take Notice of something remarkable concerning the Destruction of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> represented in Ezek. ix. when Command was given to them that had Charge over the City, to destroy the Inhabitants. v. 1,—8. And this Reason is given for it, that their Iniquity required it, and it was a just Re∣compence of their Sin. v. 9, 10. And God at the same Time was most particular and exact in his Care that such should by no Means be involved in the Slaughter, as had proved by their Behaviour, that they were not Partakers
<PB N="137" REF="008118_0157_0F6B57CE4E4273A0"/>
in the Abominations of the City. Command was given to the Angel, to go through the City, and set a Mark upon their Foreheads, and the destroying Angel had a strict Charge not to come near any Man on whom was the Mark; yet the Infants were not marked, nor a Word said of sparing them: On the contrary, Infants were expresly mentioned as those that should be utterly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with∣out Pity. v. 5, 6. <HI>Go through the City, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let not your Eye spare, neither have ye Pity. Slay utterly old and</HI> young, <HI>both Maids and</HI> little Children: <HI>But come not near any Man upon whom is the Mark.</HI></P>
<P>And if any should suspect that such Instances as these were peculiar to a more severe Dispensation, under the old Testament, let us consider a remarkable Instance in the Days of the glorious Gospel of the Grace of God; even the last Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> which was far more terrible, and with greater Testimonies of God's Wrath and Indignation, than the Destruction of <HI>Sodom,</HI> or of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> in <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI> Time, or any thing that ever had happened to any City or People, from the Beginning of the World to that Time: agreable to Matth. xxiv. 21. and Luke xxi. 22, 23. But at that Time particular Care was taken to distinguish and deliver God's People, as was fore∣told, Dan. xii. 1. And we have in the New-Testament a particular Account of the Care Christ took for the Pre∣servation of his Followers: He gave them a Sign, by which they might know when the Desolation of the City was nigh, that they that were in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> might flee to the Mountains, and escape. And as History gives Ac∣count, the Christians followed the Directions given, and escaped to a Place in the Mountains called <HI>Pella,</HI> and were preserved. Yet no Care was taken to preserve the Infants of the City, in general; but according to the Pre∣dictions of that Event, they were involved with others in that great Destruction: So heavily did the Calamity fall upon them, that those Words were verified, Luke xxiii. 29. <HI>Behold the Days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the Wombs that never
<PB N="138" REF="008118_0158_0F6B57CEDA63DFE8"/>
bare, and the Paps which never gave Suck.</HI> And that Prophecy in Deut. xxxii. 21,—25. which has undoubt∣edly special Respect to this very Time, and is so applied by the best Commentators. <HI>I will provoke them to Jea∣lousy, with those that are not a People:—For a Fire is kindled in mine Anger—and it shall burn to the lowest Hell. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heap Mischiefs upon them: I will spend mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrows upon them. They shall be burnt with Hunger, and devoured with burning Heat, and bitter Destruction.—The Sword without, &amp; Terror within, shall destroy both the young Man, and the Virgin, THE SUCKLING also, with the Man of grey Hairs.</HI> And it appears by the History of that Destruction, that at that Time was a remarkable Fulfilment of that in Deut. xxviii. 53,—57. concerning <HI>Parents eating their Children in the Siege,—and the tender &amp; delicate Woman eating her New-born Child.</HI> And here it must be remembered, that these very Destructions of that City and Land are spoken of in those Places forementioned, as clear Eviden∣ces of God's Wrath, to all Nations, which shall behold them. And if so, they were Evidences of God's Wrath towards <HI>Infants;</HI> who, equally with the rest, were the Subjects of the Destruction. If a particular Kind or Rank of Persons, which made a very considerable Part of the Inhabitants, were from Time to Time Partakers of the Overthrow, without any Distinction made in divine Pro∣vidence, and yet this was no Evidence at all of God's Dis∣pleasure with any of 'em; then a being the Subjects of such a Calamity could not be an Evidence of God's Wrath a∣gainst any of the Inhabitants, to the Reason of <HI>all Nations,</HI> or any Nation, or so much as one Person.</P>

<HEAD>Containing Observations on particular Parts of the holy Scripture, which prove the Doctrine of Original Sin.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Observations relating to Things contained in the three first Chapters of Genesis, with Reference to the Doctrine of Original Sin.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Concerning Original Righteousness; and whether our first Parents were created with Righteousness or moral Rectitude of Heart?</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine of <HI>Original Righteousness,</HI> or the Creation of our first Parents with holy Principles and Dispositions, has a close Connection, in several Respects, with the Doctrine of Original Sin. Dr.<HI>T.</HI>—was sensible of this; and accordingly he strenuously opposes this Doct∣rine, in his Book against Original Sin. And therefore in handling the Subject, I would in the first Place remove this Author's main Objection against this Doctrine; and then shew how the Doctrine may be infer'd from the Account which <HI>Moses</HI> gives us, in <HI>the three first Chapters of Genesis.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> grand Objection against this Doctrine, which he abundantly insists on, is this: That it is utterly incon∣sistent with the Nature of Virtue, that it should be con∣created with any Person; because, if so, it must be by an Act of God's absolute Power, without our Knowledge or Concurrence; and that moral Virtue, in it's very Nature implieth the Choice and Consent of the moral Agent,
<PB N="140" REF="008118_0160_0F6B57D290F4CE18"/>
without which it cannot be Virtue and Holiness: that a necessary Holiness, is no Holiness. So P. 179, 180. Where he observes, <Q>That <HI>Adam</HI> must exist, he must be created, yea he must exercise Thought and Reflection, before he was righteous.</Q> See also P. 250, 251. In P. 437. he says, <Q>To say, that God not only endowed <HI>Adam</HI> with a Capacity of being righteous, but more∣over that Righteousness and true Holiness were created with him, or wrought into his Nature, at the same Time he was made, is to affirm a Contradiction, or what is in∣consistent with the very Nature of Righteousness.</Q> And in like Manner Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> in many places insists upon it, that it is necessary to the very Being of Virtue, that it be owing to our own Choice, and diligent Culture.</P>
<P>With respect to this, I would observe, that it consists in a Notion of Virtue quite inconsistent with the Nature of Things, and the common Notions of Mankind; and also inconsistent with Dr.<HI>T—r'</HI>s own Notions of Virtue. There∣fore, if it be truly so, that to affirm that to be Virtue or Holiness which is not the Fruit of preceeding Thought, Reflection and Choice, is to affirm a Contradiction, I shall shew plainly, that for him to affirm otherwise, is a Con∣tradiction to himself.</P>
<P>In the first Place, I think it a Contradiction to the Na∣ture of Things, as judged of by the common Sense of Mankind. It is agreable to the Sense of the Minds of Men in all Nations and Ages, not only that the Fruit or Effect of a good Choice is virtuous, but the good Choice itself, from whence that Effect proceeds; yea, and not only so, but also the antecedent good Disposition, Temper or Affection of Mind, from whence proceeds that good Choice, is virtuous. This is the general Notion, not that Prin∣ciples derive their Goodness from Actions, but that Actions derive their Goodness from the Principles whence they proceed; and so that the Act of chusing that which is good, is no further virtuous than it proceeds from a good Principle, or virtuous Disposition of Mind. Which supposes, that a virtuous Disposition of Mind may be before a virtu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us
<PB N="141" REF="008118_0161_0F6B57D34E4D7408"/>
Act of Choice; and that therefore it is not necessary that there should first be Thought, Reflection and Choice, before there can be any virtuous Disposition. If the Choice be first, before the Existence of a good Disposition of Heart, what signifies that Choice? There can, accord∣ing to our natural Notions, be no Virtue in a Choice which proceeds from no virtuous Principle, but from me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Self∣love, Ambition, or some animal Appetite. And therefore a virtuous Temper of Mind may be before a good Act of Choice, as a Tree may be before the Fruit, and the Foun∣tain before the Stream which proceeds from it.</P>
<P>The following Things in Mr. <HI>Hutcheson's</HI> Enquiry concerning moral Good and Evil, are evidently agreable to the Nature of Things, and the Voice of human Sense and Reason. Sect. II. P. 132, 133. <Q>Every Action which we apprehend as either morally good or evil, is always supposed to FLOW FROM some Affections to∣wards sensitive Natures. And whatever we call Virtue or Vice, is either some such Affection, or some Action CONSEQUENT UPON IT.—All the Actions counted religious in any Country, are supposed by those who count them so, to FLOW FROM some Affections towards the Deity: and whatever we call social Virtue, we still suppose to FLOW FROM Affections towards our Fellow-Creatures.—Prudence, if it is only em∣ployed in promoting private Interest, is never imagined to be a Virtue.</Q> In these Things Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> expresly agrees with Mr. <HI>Hutcheson,</HI> who is his admired Author.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Phil.</HI> P. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,—115. P. 142. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/>▪</NOTE></P>
<P>If a virtuous Disposition or Affection is before Acts that proceed from it, then they are before those virtuous Acts of Choice which proceed from it. And therefore there is no Necessity that all virtuous Dispositions or Affections should be the Effect of Choice: and so no such supposed Necessity can be a good Objection against such a Disposi∣tion's being natural, or from a Kind of Instinct, implanted in the Mind in it's Creation. Agreable to what Mr.
<PB N="142" REF="008118_0162_0F6B57D4062CCF80"/>
<HI>Hutcheson</HI> says (<HI>Ibid.</HI> Sect. III. P. 196, 197.) <Q>I know not, says he, for what Reason some will not allow that to be Virtue, which flows from Instinct or Passions. But how do they help themselves? They say, Virtue arises from Reason. What is Reason, but the Sagacity we have in prosecuting any End? The ultimate End pro∣posed by common Moralists, is the Happiness of the Agent himself. And this certainly he is determined to pursue from Instinct. Now may not another Instinct towards the Publick, or the Good of others, be as proper a Principle of Virtue, as the Instinct towards private Hap∣piness?—If it be said, that Actions from Instinct are not the Effect of Prudence and Choice, this Object∣ion will hold full as strongly against the Actions which flow from Self-love.</Q></P>
<P>And if we consider what Dr. <HI>T.</HI> declares as his own No∣tion of the Essence of Virtue, we shall find, what he so confidently and often affirms, of it's being essential to all Virtue that it should follow Choice and proceed from it, is no less repugnant to that, than it is to the Nature of Things, and the general Notions of Mankind. For 'tis his Notion, as well as Mr. <HI>Hutcheson's,</HI> that the Essence of Virtue lies in <HI>good Affection,</HI> and particularly in Benevo∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce or <HI>Love:</HI> as he very fully declares in these Words in his Key, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marginal Note annexed to §. 326.</NOTE> <Q>That the Word that signifies Goodness and Mercy, should also signify moral Rectitude in general, will not seem strange, if we consider that <HI>Love</HI> is the fulfilling of the Law. Goodness according to the Sense of Scripture, and the Nature of Things, includes all <HI>moral Rectitude;</HI> which, I reckon, may every Part of it, where it is true and genuine, be resolved into this <HI>single Principle.</HI></Q> If it be so indeed, then certainly no Act whatsoever can have <HI>moral Rectitude,</HI> but what pro∣ceeds from <HI>this Principle.</HI> And consequently no Act of Volition or Choice can have any moral Rectitude, that takes Place before this Principles exists. And yet he most
<PB N="143" REF="008118_0163_0F6B57D51C6DFFF8"/>
confidently affirms, that Thought, Reflection and Choice must go before Virtue, and that all Virtue or Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous∣ness must be the Fruit of preceeding Choice. This brings his Scheme to an evident Contradiction. For no Act of Choice can be virtuous but what proceeds from a Principle of Benevolence or <HI>Love;</HI> for he insists that all genuine moral Rectitude, in every Part of it, is resolved into this single Principle: And yet the Principle of Benevolence is self, can't be virtuous, unless it proceeds from Choice; for he affirms that Nothing can have the Nature of Virtue but what comes from Choice. So that virtuous Love, as the Principle of all Virtue, must go before virtuous Choice, and be the Principle or Spring of it; and yet virtuous Choice must go before virtuous Benevolence, and be the Spring of that. If a virtuous Act of Choice goes before a Principle of Benevolence, and produces it, then this virtu∣ous Act is something distinct from that Principle which follows it, and is it's Effect. So that here is at least one Part of Virtue, yea the Spring and Source of all Virtue, <HI>viz.</HI> a virtuous Choice, that cannot be resolved into that single Principle of <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>Here also it is worthy to be observed, that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> P. 128. says, <HI>The Cause of every Effect, alone, is chargeable with the Effect it produceth, or which proceedeth from it:</HI> And so he argues that if the Effect be bad, the Cause alone is sinful. According to which Reasoning, when the Effect is good, the Cause alone is righteous or virtuous; to the Cause is to be ascribed all the Praise of the good Effect it produceth. And by the same Reasoning it will follow, that if, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, <HI>Adam</HI> must chuse to be righteous, before he was righteous, and if it be essential to the Nature of Righteousness or moral Rectitude, that it be the Effect of Choice, and hence a Principle of Benevolence can't have moral Rectitude, unless it proceeds from Choice; then not to the Principle of Benevolence, which is the Effect, but to the foregoing Choice alone, is to be ascribed all the Virtue or Righteousness that is in the Case. And so in Stead of all moral Rectitude, in every Part of it, being
<PB N="144" REF="008118_0164_0F6B57D58966FF68"/>
resolved into that single Principle of Benevolence, no moral Rectitude, in any Part of it, is to be resolved into that Principle: But all is to be resolved into the forego∣ing Choice, which is the Cause.</P>
<P>But yet it follows from these inconsistent Principles, there is no moral Rectitude or Virtue in the first Act of Choice, that is the Cause of all consequent Virtue. This follows two Ways; 1. Because every Part of Virtue lies in the benevolent Principle, which is the Effect; and therefore no Part of it can lie in the Cause. 2. The Choice of Virtue, as to the first Act at least, can have no Virtue or Righteousness at all, because it don't proceed from any foregoing Choice. For Dr. <HI>T.</HI> insists, that a Man must first have Reflection and Choice, before he can have Righteousness; and that it is essential to Holiness, that it proceed from Choice. So that the first Choice of Holiness, which Holiness proceeds from, can have no Vir∣tue at all, because by the Supposition it don't proceed from Choice, being the first Choice. Hence if it be essential to Holiness, that it proceeds from Choice, it must proceed from an unholy Choice; unless the first holy Choice can be before it self, or there be a virtuous Act of Choice before that which is first of all.</P>
<P>And with respect to <HI>Adam,</HI> let us consider how upon Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Principles, it was possible he ever should have any such Thing as Righteousness, by any Means at all. In the State wherein God created him, he could have no such thing as Love to God, or any Love or Benevolence in his Heart. For if so, there would have been Original Righteousness; there would have been <HI>genuine moral Rectitude;</HI> Nothing would be wanting: For our Author says, <HI>True genuine moral Rectitude, in every Part of it, is to be resolved into this single Principle.</HI> But if he were wholly without any such thing as Love to God, or any virtuous Love, how should he come by Virtue? The Answer doubtless will be, By Act of Choice: he must first chuse to be virtuous. But what if he did chuse to be virtuous? It could not be from Love to God, or any
<PB N="153" REF="008118_0165_0F6B57D69E50BE00"/>
virtuous Principle, that he chose it; for, by the Supposi∣tion, he has no such Principle in his Heart: And if he chuses it without such a Principle, still, according to this Author, there is no Virtue in his Choice; for all Virtue, he says, is to be resolved into that single Principle of Love. Or will he say, there may be produced in the Heart a virtuous Benevolence by an Act or Acts of Choice, that are not virtuous? But this don't consist with what he implicitly asserts. That to the Cause alone is to be ascribed what is in the Effect. So that there is no Way can possi∣bly be devised, in Consistence with Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme, in which <HI>Adam</HI> ever could have any Righteousness, or could ever either obtain any Principle of Virtue, or perform any one virtuous Act.</P>
<P>These confused inconsistent Assertions, concerning Vir∣tue and moral Rectitude, arise from the absurd Notions in Vogue, concerning <HI>Freedom of Will,</HI> as if it consisted in the Will's <HI>Self-determining Power,</HI> supposed to be neces∣sary to moral Agency, Virtue and Vice. The Absurdities of which, with the Grounds of these Errors, and what the Truth is respecting these Matters, with the Evidences of it, I have, according to my Ability, fully and largely consi∣dered, in my <HI>Enquiry</HI> on that Subject; to which I must refer the Reader, that desires further Satisfaction, and is willing to give himself the Trouble of reading that Dis∣course.</P>
<P>Having considered this great Argument, and pretended Demonstration of Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> against original Righteous∣ness; I proceed to the <HI>Proofs</HI> of the Doctrine. And in the first Place, I would consider, whether there be not Evidence of it in the <HI>three first</HI> Chapters of <HI>Genesis:</HI> Or, whether the History there delivered, don't lead us to sup∣pose, that our <HI>first Parents</HI> were created in a State of mo∣ral Rectitude and Holiness.</P>
<P N="1">1. This History leads us to suppose, <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, with Relation to the forbidden Fruit, was the <HI>first</HI> Sin he com∣mitted. Which could not have been, had he not always, till then, been perfectly righteous, righteous from the first
<PB N="154" REF="008118_0166_0F6B57D71AC93168"/>
Moment of his Existence; and consequently, created or brought into Existence righteous. In a moral Agent, sub∣ject to moral Obligations, it is the same thing, to be per∣fectly <HI>innocent,</HI> as to be perfectly <HI>righteous.</HI> It must be the same, because there can no more be any <HI>Medium</HI> be∣tween Sin and Righteousness, or between being right and being wrong, in a moral Sense, than there can be a Me∣dium between streight and crooked, in a natural Sense. <HI>Adam</HI> was brought into Existence capable of acting imme∣diately, as a moral Agent: and therefore he was immedi∣ately under a Rule of <HI>right</HI> Action: he was obliged as soon as he existed, to <HI>act right.</HI> And if he was obliged to act right as soon as he existed, He was obliged even then to be <HI>inclined</HI> to act right. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, P. 442. "<HI>Adam</HI> could not <HI>sin</HI> without a sinful <HI>Inclination</HI>": <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is doubtless true: for altho' there was no natural sinful Inclination in <HI>Adam,</HI> yet an Inclination to that Sin of eating the forbidden Fruit, was begotten in him by the Delusion and Error he was led into; and this Inclination to eat the for∣bidden Fruit, must preceed his actual Eating.</NOTE> And, just for the same Reason, he could not do <HI>right,</HI> with∣out an <HI>Inclination</HI> to right Action. And as he was obliged to act right from the first Moment of his Existence, and did do so, 'till he sinned in the Affair of the forbid∣den Fruit, he must have an Inclination or Disposition of Heart to do right the first Moment of his Existence; and that is the same as to be created, or brought into Existence, with an Inclination to right Action, or, which is the same Thing, a virtuous and holy Disposition of Heart.</P>
<P>Here it will be in vain to say, 'Tis true, that it was <HI>A∣dam's</HI> Duty to have a good Disposition or Inclination as soon as it was possible to be obtained, in the Nature of Things: but as it could not be without <HI>Time</HI> to establish such an Habit, which requires antecedent Thought, Re∣flexion, and repeated right Action; therefore all that <HI>A∣dam</HI> could be obliged to in the first Place, was to reflect and consider Things in a right Manner, and apply himself to
<PB N="155" REF="008118_0167_0F6B57D83284E450"/>
right Action, in order to obtain a right Disposition. For, this supposes, that even this Reflexion and Consideration, which he was obliged to, was <HI>right Action.</HI> Surely he was obliged to it no otherwise than as a thing that was <HI>right:</HI> And therefore he must have an <HI>Inclination</HI> to this right Action immediately, before he could perform those first right Actions. And as the Inclination to them should be right, the Principle or Disposition from which he per∣formed even these Actions, must be good. Otherwise, the Actions would not be right in the Sight of Him who looks at the Heart; nor would they answer the Man's Obligations, or be a doing his Duty, if he had done them for some sinister End, and not from a Regard to God and his Duty. Therefore there must be a Regard to God and his Duty implanted in him at his first Existence: Other∣wise, 'tis certain, he would have done Nothing from a Regard to God and his Duty; no, not so much as to reflect and consider, and try to obtain such a Disposition. The very Supposition of a <HI>Disposition</HI> to right Action being first obtain'd by repeated right <HI>Action,</HI> is grosly inconsistent with it self: for it supposes a Course of right Action, <HI>before</HI> there is a Disposition to perform any right Action.</P>
<P>These are no invented Quibbles, or Sophisms. If God expected of <HI>Adam</HI> any Obedience or Duty to him at all, when he first made him, whether it was in reflecting, con∣sidering, or any way exerting the Faculties he had given him, then God expected he should immediately exercise Love and Regard to Him. For how could it be expect∣ed, that <HI>Adam</HI> should have a strict and perfect Regard to God's Commands and Authority, and his Duty to Him, when he had no Love nor Regard to Him in his Heart, nor could it be expected he should have any? If <HI>Adam</HI> from the Beginning did his Duty to God, and had more Respect to the Will of his Creator, than to other Things, and as much Respect to him as he ought to have; then from the Beginning he had a supreme and perfect Respect and Love to God: And if so, he was created with such a Principle. There is no avoiding the Consequence. Not only external
<PB N="156" REF="008118_0168_0F6B57D88104A690"/>
Duties, but internal Duties, such as summarily consist in Love, must be immediately required of <HI>Adam,</HI> as soon as he existed, if any Duty at all was required. For 'tis most apparently absurd, to talk of a spiritual Being, with the Fa∣culties of Understanding and Will, being required to per∣external Duties, without internal. Dr.<HI>T.</HI> himself, observes, that Love is the fulfilling of the Law, and that <HI>all moral Rectitude, even every Part of it, must be resolved into that single Principle.</HI> Therefore, if any morally right Act at all, Reflexion, Consideration, or any thing else, was requir∣ed of <HI>Adam</HI> immediately, on his first Existence, and was performed as required; then he must, the first Moment of his Existence, have his Heart possessed of that Principle of divine <HI>Love;</HI> which implies the whole of moral Recti∣tude in every Part of it, according to our Author's own Doct∣rine; and so the whole of moral Rectitude or Righteous∣ness must begin with his Existence: which is the Thing taught in the Doctrine of original Righteousness.</P>
<P>And let us consider how it could be otherwise, than that <HI>Adam</HI> was always, in every Moment of his Existence, obliged to exercise such Regard or Respect of Heart towards every Object or Thing, as was agreable to the apparent Merit of that Object. For Instance, would it not at any Time have been a becoming Thing in <HI>Adam,</HI> on the Exhibition to his Mind of God's infinite Goodness to him, for him to have exercised answerable Gratitude; and the contrary have been unbecoming and odious? And if something had been presented to <HI>Adam's</HI> View, transcendently ami∣able in it self, as for Instance, the glorious Perfection of the divine Nature, would it not have become him to love, relish and delight in it? Would not such an Object have merited this? And if the View of an Object so a∣miable in it self did not affect his Mind with Complacence, would it not, according to the plain Dictates of our Un∣derstanding, have shown an unbecoming Temper of Mind? To say, that he had not had Time, by Culture, to form and establish a good Disposition or Relish, is not what would have taken off the Disagreableness &amp; Odiousness of
<PB N="157" REF="008118_0169_0F6B57DA119D8198"/>
the Temper. And if there had been never so much Time, I don't see, how it could be expected he should improve it aright, in order to obtain a good Disposition, if he had not already some good Disposition to engage him to it.</P>
<P>That belonging to the Will and Disposition of the Heart, which is in it self either odious or amiable, unbecoming or decent, always would have been <HI>Adam's</HI> Virtue or Sin, at any Moment of his Existence; if there be any such Thing as Virtue or Vice; by which Nothing can be meant, but That in our moral Disposition and Behaviour, which is becoming or unbecoming, amiable or odious.</P>
<P>Human Nature must be created with some Dispositions; a Disposition to relish some Things as good and amiable, and to be averse to other Things as odious &amp; disagreable. Otherwise, it must be without any such Thing as Inclina∣tion or Will: It must be perfectly indifferent, without Preference, without Choice or Aversion towards any Thing, as agreable or disagreable. But if it had any concreated Dispositions at all, they must be either right or wrong, ei∣ther agreable or disagreable to the Nature of Things. If Man had at first the highest Relish of those Things that were most excellent and beautiful, a Disposition to have the quickest and highest Delight in those Things that were most worthy of it, then his Dispositions were morally right and amiable, and never can be decent and excellent in a higher Sense. But if he had a Disposition to love most those things that were inferiour and less worthy, then his Dispositions were vicious. And 'tis evident there can be no Medium between these.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Notion of <HI>Adam's</HI> being created without a Principle of Holiness in his Heart, taken with the rest of Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Scheme, is inconsistent with what the History in the Beginning of <HI>Genesis</HI> leads us to suppose of the great Favours and Smiles of Heaven, which <HI>Adam</HI> enjoyed, while he remained in Innocency. The <HI>Mosaic</HI> Account suggests to us, that till <HI>Adam</HI> sin'd, he was in happy Cir∣cumstances, surrounded with Testimonies and Fruits of God's Favour. This is implicitly own'd by Dr. <HI>T.</HI> when
<PB N="158" REF="008118_0170_0F6B57DB190C52B0"/>
he says, P. 252. <Q>That in the Dispensation our first Pa∣rents were under, before the Fall, they were placed in a Condition proper to engage their Gratitude, Love and Obedience.</Q> But it will follow on our Author's Prin∣ciples, that <HI>Adam</HI> while in Innocency, was placed in far worse Circumstances, than he was in after his Disobedience, and infinitely worse than his Posterity are in; under un∣speakably greater Disadvantages for the avoiding Sin, and the Performance of Duty. For by his Doctrine <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity come into the World with their Hearts as free from any Propensity to Sin as he, and he was made as destitute of any Propensity to Righteousness as they: and yet God, in Favour to them, does great Things to restrain them from Sin, &amp; excit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them to Virtue, which he never did for <HI>Adam</HI> in Innocency, but laid him, in the highest Degree, under contrary Disadvantages. God, as an Instance of his great Favour, and fatherly Love to Man, since the Fall, has denied him the Ease and Pleasures of Paradise, which grati∣fied and allured his Senses, and bodily Appetites; that he might diminish his Temptations to Sin: And as a still greater Means to restrain from Sin, and promote Virtue, has subjected him to Labour, Toil &amp; Sorrow in the World: And not only so, but as a Means to promote his spiritual and eternal Good far beyond this, has doom'd him to Death: And when all this was found insufficient, he, in further Prosecution of the Designs of his Love, shortned Men's Lives exceedingly, made them twelve or thirteen times shorter than in the first Ages. And yet this, with all the innumerable Calamities, which God in great Favour to Mankind has brought on the World, whereby their Temp∣tations are so vastly cut short, and the Means and Induce∣ments to Virtue heaped one upon another, to so great a Degree, all have proved insufficient, now for so many Thousand Years together, to restrain from Wickedness in any considerable Degree; innocent human Nature, all along, coming into the World with the same Purity and harmless Dispositions, that our first Parents had in Paradise. What vast Disadvantages indeed then must <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> be in,
<PB N="159" REF="008118_0171_0F6B57DCABB96BA0"/>
that had no more in their Nature to keep them from Sin, or incline 'em to Virtue, than their Posterity, and yet were without all these additional &amp; extraordinary Means! Not only without such exceeding great Means as we now have, when our Lives are made so very short, but having vastly less Advantages than their Antediluvian Posterity, who to prevent their being wicked, and to make 'em good, had so much Labour and Toil, Sweat and Sorrow, Briars and Thorns, with a Body gradually decaying and returning to the Dust; when our first Parents had the extreme Dis∣advantage of being placed in the midst of so many and exceeding great Temptations; not only without Toil or Sorrow, Pain or Disease, to humble and mortify 'em, and a Sentence of Death to wean 'em from the World, but in the midst of the most exquisite &amp; alluring sensitive Delights, the Reverse in every respect, and to the highest Degree of that most gracious State of requisite Means, and great Ad∣vantages, which Mankind now enjoy! If Mankind now under these vast Restraints, and great Advantages, are not restrained from general, and as it were universal Wicked∣ness, how could it be expected that <HI>Adam &amp; Eve,</HI> created with no better Hearts than Men bring into the World now, and destitute of all these Advantages, and in the midst of all contrary Disadvantages, should escape it?</P>
<P>These Things are not agreeable to <HI>Moses's</HI> Account; which represents an happy State of peculiar Favours and Blessings before the Fall, and the Curse coming after∣wards: but according to this Scheme, the Curse was be∣fore the Fall, and the great Favours and Testimonies of Love followed the Apostacy. And the Curse before the Fall must be a Curse with a Witness, being to so high a De∣gree the Reverse of such Means, Means so necessary for such a Creature as innocent Man, and in all their Multitude and Fulness proving too little. Paradise therefore must be a meer Delusion! There was indeed a great Shew of Favour, in placing Man in the midst of such Delights. But this delightful Garden, it seems, with all it's Beauty and Sweetness, was in it's real Tendency worse than the Ap∣ples
<PB N="160" REF="008118_0172_0F6B57DCC64FD840"/>
of <HI>Sodom:</HI> It was but a meer Bait (God forbid the Blasphemy) the more effectually enticing by it's Beauty and Deliciousness, to <HI>Adam's</HI> eternal Ruin: which might be the more expected to be fatal to him, seeing that he was the first Man that ever existed, having no Superiority of Capacity to his Posterity, and wholly without the Ad∣vantage of the Observations, Experiences and Improve∣ments of preceding Generations; which his Posterity have.</P>
<P>I proceed now to take Notice of an Additional Proof of the Doctrine we are upon, from another Part of the holy Scripture. A very clear Text for <HI>original Righteousness</HI> is that in Eccles. vii. 29. <HI>Lo, this only have I found, that God made Man upright; but they have sought out many Inventions.</HI></P>
<P>It is an Observation of no Weight, which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> makes on this Text, that the Word <HI>Man</HI> is commonly used to signify Mankind in general, or Mankind collectively taken. It is true, it often signifies the Species of Mankind: but then it is used to signify the Species with regard to it's Duration and <HI>Succession</HI> from it's Beginning, as well as with regard to it's <HI>Extent.</HI> The English Word <HI>Man∣kind</HI> is used to signify the Species: but what if it be so? Would it be an improper or unintelligible way of Speaking, to say, that when God first made <HI>Mankind,</HI> he placed them in a pleasant Paradise (meaning in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first Parents) but now they live in the midst of Briars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thorns? And 'tis certain, that to speak of God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mankind in such a Meaning, <HI>viz.</HI> his giving the Species an Existence in their first Parents, at the Creation of the World, is a∣greable to the Scripture-Use of such an Expression. As in Deut. iv. 32. <HI>Since the Day that God</HI> CREATED <HI>MAN upon the Earth.</HI> Job xx. 4. <HI>Knowest thou not this of old, since MAN was placed upon the Earth.</HI> Isai. X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 12. <HI>I have made the Earth, and CREATED MAN upon it: I, even my Hands, have stretched out the Heavens.</HI> Jer. xxvii. 5. <HI>I HAVE MADE the Earth, the MAN and the Beast that are upon the Ground, by my great Power.</HI> All these Texts speak of
<PB N="153" REF="008118_0173_0F6B57DD32185B28"/>
God's <HI>making Man,</HI> by the Word, <HI>Man,</HI> signifying the Species of Mankind; and yet they all plainly have Respect to God's making Man <HI>at first,</HI> when God <HI>made the Earth, and stretched out the Heavens,</HI> and created the first Parents of Mankind. In all these Places the same Word <HI>Adam</HI> is used, as here in <HI>Ecclesiastes;</HI> and in the last of them, used with <HI>HE emphaticum,</HI> as it is here; tho' Dr.<HI>T.</HI> omits it, when he tells us, he gives us a Catalogue of all the Places of Scripture, where the Word is used. And it argues No∣thing to the Doctor's Purpose, that the Pronoun, <HI>They,</HI> is used. THEY <HI>have sought out many Inventions.</HI> Which is properly applied to the Species, which God made at first upright: God having begun the Species with more than one, and it being continued in a Multitude. As Christ speaks of the two Sexes, in the Relation of Man &amp; Wife, as continued in successive Generations. Matth. xix. 4. <HI>He that MADE THEM at the Beginning, made them Male and Female;</HI> having Reference to <HI>Adam &amp; Eve.</HI></P>
<P>No less impertinent, and also very unfair is his Criticism on the Word <HI>Jashar,</HI> translated <HI>Upright.</HI> Because the Word sometimes signifies <HI>Right,</HI> he would from thence infer, that it don't properly signify a moral Rectitude, even when used to express the Character of moral Agents. He might as well insist, that the English Word <HI>Upright,</HI> some∣times, and in it's most original Meaning, signifying <HI>right up,</HI> or in an erect Posture, therefore it don't properly sig∣nify any moral Character, when applied to moral Agents: And indeed less unreasonably; for 'tis known, that in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, in a peculiar Manner, most Words used to signify moral and spiritual Things, are taken from Things external and natural. The Word <HI>Jashar</HI> is used, as applied to moral Agents, or to the Words and Actions of such (if I have not mis-reckon'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Making Use of <HI>Buxtor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s</HI> Concordance, which according to the Author's profess'd Design, directs to all the Places where the Word is used.</NOTE>) about 110 Times in Scripture; and about an 100 of them, without all Dispute,
<PB N="154" REF="008118_0174_0F6B57DE4D057B18"/>
to signify Virtue, or moral Rectitude (tho' Dr.<HI>T.</HI> is pleased to say, the Word don't generally signify a moral Character;) and for the most Part it signifies <HI>true Virtue,</HI> or Virtue in such a Sense, as distinguishes it from all false Appearances of Virtue, or what is only Virtue in some Respects, but not truly so in the Sight of God. It is used at least 80 Times in this Sense. And scarce any Word can be found in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language more significant of this. It is thus used constantly in <HI>Solomon's</HI> Writings (where 'tis of∣ten found) when used to express a Character or Property of moral Agents. And it is beyond all Controversy that he uses it in this Place in the viith of <HI>Eccles.</HI> to signify a moral Rectitude, or Character of real Virtue and Integ∣rity. For the wise Man, in this Context, is speaking of Men with respect to their moral Character, enquiring into the Corruption and Depravity of Mankind (as is confess'd P. 184.) and he here declares, he had not found more than one among a Thousand, of the right Stamp, truly and tho∣roughly virtuous and upright: which appear'd a strange thing! But in this Text, he clears God, and lays the Blame to Man: Man was not made thus at first. He was made of the right Stamp, altogether good in his Kind (as all other things were) truly and thoroughly virtuous, as he ought to be; <HI>But they have sought out many Inven∣tions.</HI> Which last Expression signifies things sinful, or mo∣rally evil; as is confess'd, P. 185. And this Expression, used to signify those moral Evils he found in Man, which he sets in Opposition to the Uprightness Man was made in, shews, that by Uprightness he means the most true and sincere Goodness. The Word rendered <HI>Inventions,</HI> most naturally &amp; aptly signifies the subtil Devices, and crooked deceitful Ways of Hypocrites, wherein they are of a Cha∣racter contrary to Men of Simplicity and godly Sincerity; who, tho' wise in that which is good, are simple concern∣ing Evil. Thus the same wise Man in Prov. xii. 2. sets a truly good Man in Opposition to a Man of <HI>wicked De∣vices,</HI> whom God will condemn. <HI>Solomon</HI> had Occasion to observe many who put on an artful Disguise and fair Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w
<PB N="155" REF="008118_0175_0F6B57DE82B3B238"/>
of Goodness; But on searching thoroughly, he found very few truly upright. As he says, Prov. xx. 6. <HI>Most Men will proclaim every one his own Goodness: but a faithful Man who can find?</HI> So that it is exceeding plain, that by Uprightness, in this Place in <HI>Ecclesiastes, Solomon</HI> means true moral Goodness.</P>
<P>What our Author urges concerning <HI>many Inventions</HI> be∣ing spoken of, whereas <HI>Adam's</HI> eating the forbidden Fruit was but <HI>one Invention,</HI> is of as little Weight as the rest of what he says on this Text. For the many Lusts and Corruptions of Mankind, appearing in innumerable Ways of sinning, are all the Consequence of that Sin. The great Corruption Men are fallen into by the original Apostacy, appears in the Multitude of wicked Ways they are in∣clined to. And therefore these are properly mentioned as the Fruits and Evidences of the Greatness of that A∣postacy and Corruption.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Kind of Death, threatned to our first Parents, if they should eat of the forbidden Fruit.</HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>T.</HI> in his Observations on the three first Chapters of <HI>Genesis,</HI> says, P. 7. <Q>The Threatning to Man in Case of Transgression was, that he should surely die.—Death is the losing of Life. Death is oppos'd to Life, and must be understood according to the Nature of that Life, to which it is opposed. Now the Death here threaten'd can, with any Certainty, be opposed only to the Life God gave, <HI>Adam,</HI> when he created him, ver. 7. Any thing besides this must be pure Conjecture, without solid Foundation.</Q></P>
<P>To this I would say; 'Tis true, <HI>Death is opposed to Life, and must be understood according to the Nature of that Life, to which it is opposed:</HI> but does it therefore follow, that Nothing can be meant by it but the <HI>Loss</HI> of
<PB N="156" REF="008118_0176_0F6B57E092B0B2D0"/>
Life? Misery is opposed to Happiness, and Sorrow is in Scripture often opposed to Joy: but can we conclude from thence, that Nothing is meant in Scripture by Sorrow, but the <HI>Loss of Joy?</HI> Or that there is no more in Misery, than the <HI>Loss</HI> or Absence of Happiness? And if it be so, that the Death threatned to <HI>Adam</HI> can, with Certainty, be op∣posed only to the Life <HI>given to</HI> Adam, <HI>when God created him;</HI> I think, a State of perfect, perpetual and hopeless Misery is properly opposed to that State <HI>Adam was in, when God created him.</HI> For I suppose, it won't be deny'd, that the Life <HI>Adam</HI> had, was truly a <HI>happy</HI> Life; happy in-perfect Innocency, in the Favour of his Maker, sur∣rounded with the happy Fruits and Testimonies of his Love: and I think it has been proved, that he also was happy in a State of perfect Righteousness. And Nothing is more manifest, than that it is agreable to a very common Acceptation of the Word, <HI>Life,</HI> in Scripture, that it be un∣derstood as signifying a State of excellent and happy Ex∣istence. Now that which is most opposite to <HI>that Life</HI> and State Adam <HI>was created in,</HI> is a State of total confirmed Wickedness, and perfect hopeless Misery, under the di∣vine Displeasure and Curse; not excluding temporal Death or the Destruction of the Body, as an Introduction to it.</P>
<P>And besides, that which is much more evident, than any Thing Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says on this Head, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Death,</HI> which was to come on <HI>Adam</HI> as the <HI>Punishment</HI> of his <HI>Disobedience,</HI> was opposed to that <HI>Life</HI> which he would have had as the <HI>Reward</HI> of his <HI>Obedience,</HI> in Case he had not sin'd. <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Disobedience</HI> are Con∣traries: And the <HI>Threatnings</HI> and <HI>Promises,</HI> that are Sanctions of a Law, are set in direct Opposition: and the <HI>promised Rewards,</HI> and <HI>threatned Punishments,</HI> are what are most properly taken as each others Opposites. But none will deny, that the Life which would have been <HI>Adam's Reward,</HI> if he had persisted in Obedience, was <HI>eternal Life.</HI> And therefore we argue justly, that the Death which <HI>stands opposed to that Life</HI> (Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself being Judge, P. 396.) <HI>is manifestly eternal Death, a Death widely different
<PB N="157" REF="008118_0177_0F6B57E1AA7118D8"/>
from the Death we now die.</HI>—to use his own Words. If <HI>Adam,</HI> for his persevering <HI>Obedience,</HI> was to have had <HI>ever∣lasting Life and Happiness,</HI> in <HI>perfect Holiness, Union</HI> with his Maker, and <HI>Enjoyment of his Favour,</HI> and this was the Life which was to be confirmed by the Tree of Life; then doubtless the Death threatned in Case of Disobedience, which stands in direct Opposition to this, was a being given over to <HI>everlasting Wickedness &amp; Misery,</HI> in <HI>Separation</HI> from God and in <HI>enduring his Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>And it may with the greatest Reason be supposed, that when God first made Mankind, and made known to them the Methods of his moral Government towards them, in the Revelation he made of Himself to the natural Head of the whole Species; and let him know, that Obedience to Him was expected as his Duty; and inforced this Duty with the Sanction of a threaten'd Punishment, called by the Name of <HI>Death;</HI> I say, we may with the greatest Reason suppose in such a Case, that by <HI>Death</HI> was meant that same Death which God esteemed to be the most proper Punishment of the Sin of Mankind, and which he speaks of under that Name, throughout the Scripture, as the proper Wages of the Sin of Man, &amp; was always from the Beginning understood to be so in the Church of God. It would be strange indeed, if it should be otherwise. It would have been strange, if when the Law of God was first given, &amp; inforced by the Threatning of a Punishment, Nothing at all had been mention'd of that great Punish∣ment, ever spoken of under the Name of <HI>Death</HI> (in the Revelations which he has given to Mankind from Age to Age) as the proper Punishment of the Sin of Mankind, And it would be no less strange, if when the Punishment which was mentioned and threatned on that Occasion, was called by the same Name, even Death, yet we must not understand it to mean the same Thing, but something infi∣nitely diverse, and infinitely more inconsiderable.</P>
<P>But now, let us consider what that Death is, which the Scripture ever speaks of as the proper Wages of the Sin of Mankind, and is spoken of as such by God's Saints in
<PB N="158" REF="008118_0178_0F6B57E2DCDFC4F8"/>
all Ages of the Church, from the first Beginning of a written Revelation, to the Conclusion of it. I'll begin with the New-Testament. When the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> says, Rom. vi. 23. <HI>The Wages of Sin is</HI> Death, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> tells us, P. 396. that <HI>this means eternal Death, the second Death, a Death widely different from the Death we now die.</HI> The same Apostle speaks of Death as the proper Punish∣ment due for Sin, in Rom. vii. 5. and Chap. viii. 13, 2 Cor. iii. 7. 1 Cor. xv. 56. In all which Places, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself supposes the Apostle to intend eternal Death. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 78. Note on Rom vii. 5. and Note on ver. 6. Note on Rom. v. 20. Note on Rom. vii. 8.</NOTE> And when the Apostle <HI>James</HI> speaks of Death, as the proper Reward, Fruit and End of Sin, Jam. i. 15. <HI>Sin, when it is finish∣ed, bringeth forth Death:</HI> 'tis manifest, that our Author supposes eternal Destruction to be meant.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">By comparing what he says P. 126. with what he often says of that Death and Destruction which is the Demerit &amp; End of personal Sin, which he says is the <HI>second Death,</HI> or <HI>eternal Destruction.</HI></NOTE> And the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> agreable to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Sense, speaks of the second Death, as that which Sin unrepented of will bring all Men to at last. Rev. xx. 6, 14. and xxi. 8. and Chap. ii. 11. In the same Sense the Apostle <HI>John</HI> uses the Word in his 1st Epistle, Chap. iii. 14. <HI>We know, that we have passed from</HI> Death <HI>to Life, because we love the Brethren: He that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ateth his Brother, abideth in</HI> Death. In the same Manner Christ used the Word from Time to Time, when he was on Earth, and spake concerning the Punishment and Issue of Sin. Joh. v. 24. <HI>He that heareth my Word, and believeth,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>hath everlasting Life; and shall not come into Condemnation; but is passed from</HI> Death <HI>to Life.</HI> Where, according to Dr.<HI>T—r'</HI>s own Way of arguing, it can't be the Death which we now die, that Christ speaks of, but eternal Death, because it is set in Opposition to everlasting Life. Joh. vi. 50. <HI>This is the Bread which cometh down from Heaven, that a Man may eat thereof, and not</HI> die. Chap. viii. 51. <HI>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a Man
<PB N="159" REF="008118_0179_0F6B57E307088598"/>
keep my Saying, he shall never see</HI> Death. Chap. xi. 26. <HI>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.</HI> In which Places, 'tis plain, Christ don't mean that Believers shall never see temporal Death. See also Matth. x. 29. and Luke x. 28. In like Manner, the Word was common∣ly used by the Prophets of old, when they spake of Death as the proper End &amp; Recompence of Sin. So, abundantly by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> Ezek. iii. 18. <HI>When I say unto the wicked Man, Thou shalt surely</HI> die. In the Original, <HI>Dying thou shalt die.</HI>—The same Form of Expression, which God used in the Threatning to <HI>Adam.</HI> We have the same Words again, Chap. xxxiii. 18.—In Chap. xviii. 4. it is said, <HI>The Soul that sinneth, it shall</HI> die. To the like Purpose are Chap. iii. 19, 20. &amp; xviii. 4, 5, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28. Chap. xxxiii. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20. And that temporal Death is not meant in these Places, is plain, because it is promised most abso∣lutely that the Righteous shall not die the Death spoken of. Chap▪xvii.21. <HI>He shall surely live, he shall not</HI> die. So v. 9, 17, 19 &amp; 22. and Chap. iii. 21. And 'tis evident, the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> uses the Word in the same Sense; Jer. xxxi. 30. <HI>Every one shall die for his own Iniquity.</HI> And the same Death is spoken of by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah.</HI> Isai. xi. 4. <HI>With the Breath of his Lips shall be</HI> slay <HI>the Wicked.</HI> See also Chap. lxi. 16. with v. 24.—<HI>Solomon,</HI> who we must suppose was thoroughly acquainted with the Sense in which the Word was used by the Wise, and by the Ancients, continually speaks of Death as the proper Fruit, Issue and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>compence of Sin, using the Word only in this Sense. Chap. xi. 19. <HI>As Righteousness tendeth to</HI> Life, <HI>so he that pursueth Evil, pursueth it to his own</HI> Death. So Chap. xviii. 32. x. 21. xiv. 12. xix. 16. i. 18, 32. i. 18. v. 5, 6, 23. vii. 22, 26, 27. ix. 18. xi. 19. xv. 10. xviii. 21. xxi. 16. &amp; xxiii. 13, 14. In these Places, he cannot mean temporal Death; for he often speaks of it as a Punishment of the Wicked, wherein the Righteous shall certainly be distinguished from 'em: as in Prov. xii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>In the Way of Righteousness is Life, and in the Path∣way
<PB N="160" REF="008118_0180_0F6B57E3CE2AB198"/>
thereof is no</HI> Death. So in Chap. x.2.—xi.4.—xiii. 14.—xiv. 27. and many other Places. But we find, this same Wise man observes, that as to temporal Death, and temporal Events in general, there is no Distinction, but that they happen alike to good and bad. Eccl. ii. 14, 15, 16.—viii. 14. &amp; ix. 2,3. His Words are re∣markable in Eccl. vii. 15. <HI>There is a just Man that</HI> pe∣risheth <HI>in his Righteousness; and there is a wicked Man that</HI> prolongeth his Life <HI>in his Wickedness.</HI>—So we find, <HI>David</HI> in the Book of Psalms uses the Word <HI>Death</HI> in the same Sense, when he speaks of it as the proper Wages and Issue of Sin. Psal. xxxiv. 21.<HI>Evil shall</HI> slay <HI>the Wicked.</HI> He speaks of it as a certain Thing, Psal. cxxxix. 19. <HI>Surely Thou wilt slay the Wicked, O God.</HI> And he speaks of it as a Thing wherein the Wicked are distin∣guished from the Righteous, Psal. lxix. 28. <HI>Let them be blotted out of the Book of the</HI> Living, <HI>and not be written with the Righteous.</HI>—And thus we find the Word Death used in the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> or Books of <HI>Moses:</HI> in which Part of the Scripture it is, that we have the Account of the Threatning of Death to <HI>Adam.</HI> When Death, in these Books, is spoken of as the proper Fruit &amp; appointed Reward of Sin, it is to be understood of eternal Death. So Deut. xxx. 15. <HI>See, I have set before thee this Day,</HI> Life <HI>and Good, and</HI> Death <HI>and Evil.</HI> Ver. 19. <HI>I call Hea∣ven and Earth to Record this Day against you, that I have set before you Life and Death, Blessing &amp; Cursing.</HI> The Life that is spoken of here, is doubtless the same that is spoken of in Lev. xviii. 5.<HI>Ye shall therefore keep my Statutes and my Judgments, which if a Man do, he shall live in them.</HI> This the Apostle understands of <HI>eternal Life;</HI> as is plain by Rom. x. 5. and Gal. iii. 12.—But that the Death threatned for Sin in the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> meant eternal Death, is what Dr.<HI>T</HI> abundantly declares. So in his Note on Rom. v. 20. <HI>Such a Constitution the Law of</HI> Moses <HI>was, subjecting those who were under it to Death for every Transgression; meaning by Death ETERNAL DEATH.</HI> These are his Words. The like he asserts
<PB N="161" REF="008118_0181_0F6B57E489F88550"/>
in many other Places. When it is said, in the Place now mentioned, <HI>I have set before thee</HI> Life &amp; Death, <HI>Blessing and Cursing,</HI> without doubt, the same <HI>Blessing and Cursing</HI> is meant which God had already set before them with such Solemnity, in the 27th and 28th Chapters; where we have the Sum of the Curses in those last Words of the 27th Chapter, <HI>Cursed is every one, which confirmeth not all the Words of this Law to do them.</HI> Which the Apostle speaks of as a Threatning of eternal Death; and with him Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note on Rom. v. 20. In his Exp. on Rom. P. 371, 373, 374, 376. There in P. 371, he says expresly, "The Law of <HI>Moses</HI> subjected those who were under it to Death, mean∣ing by Death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Death."</NOTE> In this Sense also <HI>Job</HI> and his Friends, spake of <HI>Death,</HI> as the Wages and End of Sin, who lived before any written Revelation, and had their Religion and their Phraseology about the Things of Re∣ligion from the Antients.</P>
<P>If any should insist upon it as an Objection against sup∣posing that Death was intended to signify eternal Death in the Threatning to <HI>Adam,</HI> that this Use of the Word is figurative: tho' this should be allowed, yet it is by no Means so figurative as many other Phrases used in the History contained in these three Chapters: As when it is said, <HI>God said, Let there be Light; God said, Let there be a Firmament,</HI> &amp;c as tho' God spake such Words with a Voice. So when it is said, <HI>God</HI> called <HI>the Light, Day: God</HI> called <HI>the Firmament, Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>God</HI> rested <HI>on the seventh Day;</HI> as tho' he had been weary, and then rested. <HI>And when it is said, They heard the</HI> Voice of God walking; as tho' the Deity had two Feet, and took Steps on the Ground. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes, that when it is said of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve, Their Eyes were opened, and they saw that they were naked;</HI> by the Word <HI>naked,</HI> is meant a <HI>State of Guilt.</HI> (P. 12.) Which Sense of the Word, <HI>naked,</HI> is much further from the common Use of the Word, than the supposed Sense of the Word <HI>Death.</HI> So this Author supposes the Promise concerning the Seed
<PB N="162" REF="008118_0182_0F6B57E556E0BC38"/>
of the Woman's <HI>bruising the Serpent's Head,</HI> while the Serpent should <HI>bruise his Heel,</HI> is to be understood of <HI>the Messiah's destroying the Power and Sovereignty of the Devil, &amp; receiving some slight Hurt from him.</HI> (P. 15, 16.) Which makes the Sentence full of Figures, vastly more beside the common Use of Words. And why might not God deliver Threatnings to our first Parents in figurative Expressions, as well as Promises?—Many other strong Figures are used in these Chapters.</P>
<P>But indeed, there is no Necessity of supposing the Word <HI>Death,</HI> or the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word so translated, if used in the Manner that has been supposed, to have been figurative at all. It does not appear but that this World, in it's true and proper Meaning, might signify perfect Misery, and sensible Destruction; tho' the Word was also applied to signify something more external and visible. There are many Words in our Language, such as <HI>Heart, Sense, View, Dis∣covery, Conception, Light,</HI> and many others, which are applied to signify external Things, as that muscular Part of the Body called <HI>Heart;</HI> external Feeling called <HI>Sense;</HI> the Sight of the bodily Eye called <HI>View;</HI> the finding of a Thing by it's being uncovered, called <HI>Discovery;</HI> the first Beginning of the Foetus in the Womb, called <HI>Con∣ception;</HI> and the Rays of the Sun, called <HI>Light:</HI> Yet these Words do as truly and properly signify other Things of a more spiritual internal Nature, as those: Such as the Disposition, Affection, Perception &amp; Thought of the Mind, and Manifestation and Evidence to the Soul. Common Use, which governs the Propriety of Language, makes the latter Things to be as much signified by those Words, in their proper Meaning, as the former. 'Tis especially common in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and I suppose, other oriental Lan∣guages, that the same Word that signifies something exter∣nal, does no less properly and usually signify something more spiritual. So the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Words used for Breath, have such a double Signification; <HI>Neshama</HI> signifies both <HI>Breath,</HI> and the <HI>Soul;</HI> and the latter as commonly as the former: <HI>Ruach</HI> is used for <HI>Breath</HI> or <HI>Wind,</HI> but yet more
<PB N="163" REF="008118_0183_0F6B57E638B7D238"/>
commonly signifies <HI>Spirit. Nephesh</HI> is used for <HI>Breath,</HI> but yet more commonly signifies <HI>Soul.</HI> So the Word <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bh, Heart,</HI> no less properly signifies the <HI>Soul,</HI> especially with Regard to the Will and Affections, than that Part of the Body so called. The Word <HI>Shalom,</HI> which we render <HI>Peace,</HI> no less properly signifies Prosperity and Happiness, than mutual Agreement. The Word translated,<HI>Life,</HI> sig∣nifies the natural Life of the Body, and also the perfect and happy State of sensible active Being; and the latter as properly as the former. So the Word, <HI>Death,</HI> signifies De∣struction, as to outward <HI>Sensibility,</HI> Activity &amp; Enjoyment: But it has most evidently another Signification, which, in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, is no less proper, <HI>viz. perfect, sen∣sible, hopeless Ruin and Misery.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis therefore wholly without Reason urged, that Death properly signifies only the Loss of this present Life: and that therefore Nothing else was meant by that Death which was threatned for eating the forbidden Fruit. Nor does it at all appear but that <HI>Adam,</HI> who from what God said concerning the Seed of the Woman, that was so very figu∣rative, could understand, that Relief was promised, as to the Death which was threatned (as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself supposes, P. 18.) understood the Death that was threatned, in the more important Sense; especially seeing temporal Death, as it is originally, and in itself, and is evermore, excepting as changed by divine Grace, an Introduction or Entrance into that gloomy dismal State of Misery, which is shadow'd forth by the dark and awful Circumstances of this Death, naturally suggesting to the Mind the most dreadful State of hopeless, sensible Ruin.</P>
<P>As to that Objection which some have made, that the Phrase, <HI>Dying thou shalt die,</HI> is several Times used in the Books of <HI>Moses</HI> to signify temporal Death, it can be of no Force. For it has been shown already, that the same Phrase is sometimes used in Scripture to signify eternal Death, in Instances much more parallel with this. But indeed No∣thing can be certainly argued concerning the Nature of the Thing intended, from it's being expressed in such a
<PB N="164" REF="008118_0184_0F6B57E6D1A6B510"/>
Manner. For 'tis evident, that such Repetitions of a Word in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, are no more than an Emphasis upon a Word in the more modern Languages, to signify the great Degree of a Thing, the Importance of it, or the Certainty of it, &amp;c. When we would signify and impress these, we commonly put an Emphasis on our Words: In Stead of this, the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> when they would express a Thing strongly, repeated or doubled the Word, the more to impress the Mind of the Hearer; as may be plain to every one in the least conversant with the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bible. The Repetition in the Threatning to <HI>Adam,</HI> therefore only implies the Solemnity, and Importance of the Threatning. But God may denounce either eternal or temporal Death with Peremptoriness and Solemnity, and Nothing can cer∣tainly be infer'd concerning the Nature of the Thing threatned, because 'tis threatned with Emphasis, more than this, that the Threatning is much to be regarded. Tho' it be true, that it might in an especial Manner be expected that a Threatning of eternal Death, would be denounced with great Emphasis, such a Threatning being infinitely important, and to be regarded above all others.</P>

<HEAD>Wherein it is enquired, whether there be any thing in the History of the three first Chapters of Genesis, which should lead us to suppose, that God, in his Constitution with Adam, dealt with Mankind in general, as included in their first Father, and that the Threatning of Death, in Case he should eat the forbidden Fruit, had Respect not only to him, but his Posterity?</HEAD>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> rehearsing that Threatning to <HI>Adam, Thou shalt surely die,</HI> and giving us his Paraphrase of it, P. 7, 8. concludes thus; "Observe, here is not <HI>one Word</HI> relating to <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity." But it may be observed
<PB N="165" REF="008118_0185_0F6B57E78E122088"/>
in Opposition to this, that there is scarcely <HI>one Word</HI> that we have an Account of, which God ever said to <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Eve,</HI> but what does manifestly include their Posterity in the Meaning and Design of it. There is as much of <HI>a Word</HI> said about <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity in that Thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tning, as there is in those Words of God to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> Gen. i. 28. <HI>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it;</HI> and as much in Events, to lead us to sup∣pose <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity to be included. There is as much of <HI>a Word</HI> of his Posterity in that Threatning, as in those Words, v. 29. <HI>Behold, I have given you every Herb bear∣ing Seed—and every Tree in which is the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed,</HI> &amp;c. Even when God was about to create <HI>Adam,</HI> what he said on that Occasion, had not Re∣spect only to <HI>Adam,</HI> but to his Posterity. Gen. i. 26. <HI>Let us make Man in our Image, and let them have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea,</HI> &amp;c.

Tho' he is therein utterly incon∣sistent with himself, inasmuch as he at the same Time a∣bundantly insists, that Death is not brought on <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, in Consequence of his Sin, at all as a Punish∣ment; but meerly by the gracious Disposal of a Father, bestowing a <HI>Benefit of the highest Nature</HI> upon them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 303.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="008118_0186_0F6B57E8425F8370"/>But I shall shew that I don't in any of these Things falsely charge, or misrepresent Dr. <HI>T.</HI>—He speaks of the Sentence in Chap. iii. 19. as pronounced in Pursuance of the Threatning in the former Chapter, in these Words, P. 17, 18. <Q>The Sentence upon the Man, v. 17, 18, 19. first affects the Earth, upon which he was to subsist: The Ground should be incumbred with many noxious Weeds, and the Tillage of it more toilsom: Which would ob∣lige Man to procure a Sustenance by hard Labour, till he should die, and drop into the Ground, from whence he was taken. Thus Death enter'd by Sin into the World, and Man became mortal, ACCORDING TO THE THREATNING IN THE FORMER CHAPTER.</Q> Now, if Mankind becomes mortal, and must die, according to the Threatning in the former Chapter, then doubtless the Threatning in the former Chapter, <HI>Thou shalt die,</HI> had Respect not only to <HI>Adam,</HI> but to Mankind, and included <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity. Yea, and Dr. <HI>T.</HI> is express in it, and very often so, that the Sentence concerning dropping into the Ground, or returning to the Dust, did include <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity. So, P. 19, 20 speak∣ing there of that Sentence, <Q>Observe (says he) that we their Posterity are in Fact subjected to the same Afflicti∣on &amp; Mortality, here by Sentence inflicted upon our first Parents.—P. 42. But yet Men, thro' that long Tract, were all subject to Death, therefore they must be in∣cluded in the Sentence.</Q> The same he affirms in innu∣merable other Places, some of which I shall have Occasion to mention presently.</P>
<P>The Sentence which is founded on the Threatning, and (as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says) <HI>according to the Threatning,</HI> extends to as many as were included in the Threatning, and to no more. If the Sentence be upon a collective Subject, in∣finitely (as it were) the greatest Part of which were not included in the Threatning, nor were ever threatned at all by any Threatning whatsoever, then certainly this Sen∣tence is not <HI>according to the Threatning,</HI> nor built upon it. If the Sentence be according to the Threatning, then
<PB N="167" REF="008118_0187_0F6B57E971D91FA8"/>
we may justly explain the Threatning by the Sentence: And if we find the Sentence spoken to the same Person, to whom the Threatning was spoken, and spoken in the second Person singular, in like Manner with the Threatning, and <HI>founded on the</HI> Threatning, and <HI>according to</HI> the Threatning; and if we find the Sentence includes <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity; then we may certainly infer, that so did the Threatning: And hence, that both the Threatning and Sentence were deliver'd to <HI>Adam</HI> as the publick Head and Representative of his Posterity.</P>
<P>And we may also further infer from it, in another Respect directly contrary to Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Doctrine, that the Sen∣tence which included <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, was to Death <HI>as a Punishment</HI> to that Posterity, as well as to <HI>Adam</HI> him∣self. For a Sentence pronounced in Execution of a Threatning, is to a Punishment. Threatnings are of Pun∣ishments. Neither God nor Man are wont to threaten others with Favours and Benefits.</P>
<P>But lest any of this Author's Admirers should stand to it, that it may very properly be said, God <HI>threatned</HI> Mankind with bestowing great Kindness upon them, I would observe, that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> often speaks of this Sentence as pronounced by God on <HI>all Mankind</HI> as <HI>condemning them,</HI> speaks of it as <HI>a Sentence of Condemnation judicially pronounced,</HI> or a Sentence which God pronounced on all Mankind <HI>acting as their Judge,</HI> and <HI>in a judicial Pro∣ceeding:</HI> Which he affirms in Multitudes of Places. In P. 20. speaking of this Sentence, which, he there says, sub∣jects us, <HI>Adam's</HI> and <HI>Eve's</HI> Posterity, to Affliction and Mortality, he calls it a judicial Act of Condemnation. <Q>The <HI>judicial Act of Condemnation</HI> (says he) clearly implies, a taking him to Pieces, and turning him to the Ground, from whence he was taken.</Q> And P. 28, 29. <Q>In all the Scripture, from one End to the other, there is recorded but one <HI>Judgment to Condemnation,</HI> which came upon <HI>all Men,</HI> and that is, Gen. iii. 17, 18, 19. <HI>Dust thou art,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> P. 40. speaking of the same, he says, <HI>"All Men</HI> are brought under <HI>Condemnation."</HI> In
<PB N="168" REF="008118_0188_0F6B57E9CCFC2C48"/>
P. 27, 28. <Q>By Judgment, <HI>Judgment of Condemnation,</HI> it appeareth evidently to me, he [<HI>Paul</HI>] means the being <HI>adjudged</HI> to the forementioned Death; he means the <HI>Sen∣tence of Death,</HI> of a general Mortality, <HI>pronounced upon Mankind,</HI> in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> first Transgression. And the <HI>Condemnation</HI> inflicted by the <HI>Judgment of God,</HI> answereth to, and is in Effect the same Thing with, being dead.</Q> P. 30. <Q>The many, that is Man∣kind, were subject to Death by the <HI>judicial Act</HI> of God.</Q> P. 31. <Q>Being made Sinners, may very well signify, being <HI>adjudged,</HI> or <HI>condemned</HI> to Death.—For the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word, &amp;c. signifies to make one a Sinner by a <HI>judicial Sentence,</HI> or to <HI>condemn.</HI></Q>—Paraph. on Rom. V. 19. in his Exp. of the Epistle, <Q>Upon the Account of one Man's Disobedience, <HI>Mankind</HI> were <HI>judicially consti∣tuted Sinners;</HI> that is, subjected to Death, by the <HI>Sen∣tence</HI> of God the <HI>Judge.</HI></Q> And there are many other Places where he repeats the same Thing. And 'tis pretty remarkable, that in P. 48, 49. immediately after citing Prov. xvii. 15. <HI>He that justifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Just, are both an Abomination to the Lord;</HI> And when he is careful in citing these Words, to put us in Mind, that it is meant of a <HI>judicial Act;</HI> yet in the very next Words, he supposes that God himself does so, since he constantly supposes that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity whom God condemns, are innocent. His Words are these, <Q>From all which it followeth, that the Judgment that passed upon all Men to <HI>Condemnation,</HI> is Death's com∣ing upon <HI>all Men,</HI> by the <HI>judicial Act of God,</HI> upon Occasion of <HI>Adam's</HI> Transgression.</Q>—And 'tis very remarkable, that in P. 279, 280, and 283 he insists, <Q>That in Scripture no Action is said to be imputed, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣kon'd or accounted to any Person, either for Righte∣ousness or CONDEMNATION, but the proper Act and Deed of that Person.</Q>—And yet he thus continu∣ally affirms, that all Mankind are made Sinners by a <HI>judi∣cial Act of God</HI> the <HI>Judge,</HI> even to <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and <HI>judi∣cially constituted Sinners,</HI> and so subjected to a <HI>judicial

Sentence of Condemnation,</HI> on Occasion of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin; and all <HI>according to the Threatning</HI> denounced to <HI>Adam, Thou shalt surely die:</HI> Tho' he supposes <HI>Adam's</HI> Poste∣rity were not included in the Threatning, and are looked upon as perfectly innocent, and treated wholly as such.</P>
<P>I am sensible, Dr.<HI>T.</HI> don't run into all this Inconsistence, only thro' Oversight and Blundering; but that he is driven to it, to make out his Matters in his Evasion of that noted Paragraph in the fifth Chapter of <HI>Romans;</HI> especially those three Sentences, v. 16. <HI>The Judgment was by one to Condemnation.</HI> v. 18. <HI>By the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</HI> and v. 19. <HI>By one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners.</HI> And I am also sensible of what he offers to salve the Inconvenience, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if the Threatning had immediately been ex∣ecuted on <HI>Adam,</HI> he would have had no Posterity; and that so far the possible Existence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity fell under the Threatning of the Law, and into the Hands of the Judge, to be disposed of as he should think fit: And that this is the Ground of the Judg∣ment to Condemnation, coming upon all Men.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 95. 366, 367.</NOTE> But this is trifling, to a great Degree: For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Suffering Death, and failing of possible Existence, are entirely different Things. If there had never been any such Thing as Sin committed, there would have been in∣finite Numbers of possible Beings, which would have fail'd of Existence, by God's Appointment. God has appointed not to bring into Existence numberless possible Worlds, each replenished with innumerable possible Inhabitants. But is this equivalent to God's appointing them all to suffer Death?</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Author represents, that <HI>by Adam's Sin the Possi∣ble Existence of his Posterity fell into the Hands of the Judge, to be disposed of as he should think fit.</HI> But there was no Need of any Sin of <HI>Adam's,</HI> or any Body's else, in order to their being brought into God's Hands in this
<PB N="170" REF="008118_0190_0F6B57EB58EA43F0"/>
Respect. The future possible Existence of all created Be∣ings, is in God▪s Hands, antecedently to the Existence of any Sin. And therefore by God's sovereign Appointment, in∣finite Numbers of possible Beings, without any Relation to <HI>Adam,</HI> or any other sinning Being, do fail of their possi∣ble Existence. And if <HI>Adam</HI> had never sinned, yet it would be unreasonable to suppose, but that innumerable of his possible Posterity, would have fail'd of Existence by God's Disposal. For will any be so unreasonable as to imagine, that God would and must have brought into Ex∣istence as many of his Posterity as it was possible should be, if he had not sin'd? Or that in that Case, it would not have been possible, any other Persons of his Posterity should ever have existed, than those individual Persons, who now actually fall under that Sentence of suffering Death, and returning to the Dust?</P>
<P N="3">3. We have many Accounts in Scripture, which imply the actual failing of the possible Existence of innumerable Multitudes of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity, yea, of many more than ever come into Existence. As, of the possible Posterity of <HI>Abel,</HI> the possible Posterity of all them that were destroy'd by the Flood, and the possible Posterity of the innumera∣ble Multitudes, which we read of in Scripture, destroyed by Sword, Pestilence, &amp;c. And if the Threatning to <HI>Adam</HI> reached his Posterity, in no other respect than this, that they were liable to be deprived by it of their possible Existence, then these Instances are much more properly a Fulfilment of that Threatning, than the suffering of Death by such as actually come into Existence; and so is that which is most properly the Judgment to Condem∣nation, executed by the Sentence of the Judge, proceeding on the Foot of that Threatning. But where do we ever find this so represented in Scripture? We read of Multi∣tudes cut off for their personal Sins, who thereby fail'd of their possible Posterity. And these are mentioned as God's Judgments on them, and Effects of God's Condemnation of them: but when are they ever spoken of as God's ju∣dicially proceeding against, and condemning their possible Posterity?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="171" REF="008118_0191_0F6B57EC04556BB8"/>4. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> in what he says concerning this Matter, speaks of the Threatning of the Law delivered to <HI>Adam,</HI> which the possible Existence of his Posterity fell under, <HI>as the Ground of the Judgment to Condemnation coming upon all Men.</HI> But herein he is exceeding inconsistent with himself: For he affirms in a Place forecited, that the Scripture never speaks of any Sentence of Condemnation coming upon all Men, but that Sentence in the third of <HI>Genesis,</HI> concerning Man's turning to Dust. But accord∣ing to him, the Threatning of the Law delivered to <HI>Adam,</HI> could not be the Ground of that Sentence; for he greatly insists upon it, that that Law was entirely abrogated before that Sentence was pronounced, that this Law at that Time was <HI>not in Being, had no Existence</HI> to have any such In∣fluence, as might procure a Sentence of Death; and that therefore this Sentence was introduced entirely on another Foot, <HI>viz.</HI> on the Foot of a new Dispensation of Grace. The Reader may see this Matter strenuously urged, and particularly argued by him, P. 389,—396. So that this Sentence could not, according to him, have the Threatning of that Law for it's Ground, as he supposes; for it never stood upon that Ground. It could not be called a Judg∣ment of Condemnation, <HI>under any such View;</HI> for it could not be viewed under Circumstances, under which it never existed.</P>
<P N="5">5. If it be as our Author supposes, that the Sentence of Death on all Men comes under the Notion of a Judg∣ment to Condemnation by this Means, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Threat∣ning to <HI>Adam</HI> was in some respect the Ground of it; then it also comes under the Notion of a Punishment: For Threatnings annexed to Breaches of Laws, are to Punish∣ments; and a Judgment of Condemnation to the Thing threatned, must be to Punishment; and the Thing con∣demned to, must have as much the Notion of a Punish∣ment, as the Sentence has the Notion of a Judgment to Condemnation. But this Dr.<HI>T.</HI> wholly denies: he denies that the Death sentenced to, comes as any Punishment at all; but insists that it comes only as a Favour &amp; Benefit,
<PB N="172" REF="008118_0192_0F6B57ECF4527860"/>
and a Fruit of fatherly Love to <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, respect∣ed not as guilty, but wholly innocent. So that his Scheme will not admit of it's coming under the Notion of a Sen∣tence to Condemnation in any Respect whatsoever. Our Author's Supposition, that the possible Existence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity comes under the Threatning of the Law, and into the Hands of the Judge, and is the Ground of the Condemnation of all Men to Death, implies, that Death by this Sentence is appointed to Mankind as an Evil, at least, negatively so; as it is a Privation of Good: for he manifestly speaks of a Non-existence as a negative Evil. But herein he is inconsistent with himself: for he conti∣nually insists, that Mankind are subjected to Death <HI>only as a Benefit,</HI> as has been before shewn. According to him, Death is not appointed to Mankind as a negative Evil, as any Cessation of Existence, as any Cessation or even Di∣minution of Good; but on the contrary, as a Means of <HI>a more happy Existence,</HI> and a great <HI>Increase of Good.</HI></P>
<P>So that this Evasion, or Salvo of Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s is so far from helping the Matter, or salving the Inconsistence, that it increases and multiplies it.</P>
<P>And that the Constitution or Law, with the Threatning of Death annexed, which was given to <HI>Adam,</HI> was to him as the Head of Mankind, and to his Posterity as included in him, not only follows from some of our Author's own Assertions, and the plain and full Declarations of the A∣postle in the fifth of <HI>Romans</HI> (of which more afterwards) which drove Dr. <HI>T.</HI> into such gross Inconsistencies. But the Account given in the three first Chapters of <HI>Genesis,</HI> directly and inevitably lead us to such a Conclusion.</P>
<P>Tho' the Sentence, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 19,—<HI>Unto Dust thou shalt return,</HI> be not of equal Extent with the Threatning in the foregoing Chapter, or an Execution of the main Curse of the Law therein denounced; for, that it should have been so, would have been inconsistent with the Intimati∣ons of Mercy just before given: yet tis plain, this Sentence is in Pursuance of that Threatning, being to something that was included in it. The Words of the Sentence were
<PB N="173" REF="008118_0193_0F6B57ED8213A590"/>
delivered to the same Person, with the Words of the Threatning, and in the same Manner, in like singular Terms, as much without any express Mention of his Posterity: And yet it manifestly appears by the Consequence, as well as all Circumstances, that his Posterity were included in the Words of the Sentence; as is confess'd on all Hands. And as the Words were apparently deliver'd in the Form of the Sentence of a <HI>Judge,</HI> condemning for something that he was displeased with, and ought to be condemned, <HI>viz.</HI> Sin; and as the Sentence to him &amp; his Posterity was but one, dooming to the same Suffering, under the same Cir∣cumstances, both the one and the other sentenced in the same Words, spoken but once, and immediately to but one Person, we hence justly infer, that it was the same Thing to both; and not as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> suggests, (P. 67.) a Sentence to a proper Punishment to <HI>Adam,</HI> but a meer Promise of Favour to his Posterity.</P>
<P>Indeed, sometimes our Author seems to suppose, that God meant the Thing denounced in this Sentence, as a Favour both to <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 301, 321, 322.</NOTE> But to his Posterity, or Mankind in general, who are the main Sub∣ject, he ever insists, that it was purely intended as a Favour. And therefore, one would have thought, the Sentence should have been delivered, with Manifestations and Ap∣pearances of Favour, and not of Anger. How could <HI>Adam</HI> understand it as a Promise of great Favour, consi∣dering the Manner and Circumstances of the Denunciati∣on? How could he think, that God would go about to delude him, by cloathing himself with Garments of Ven∣geance, using Words of Displeasure and Rebuke, setting forth the Heinousness of his Crime, attended with Che∣rubims and a flaming Sword; when all that he meant was only higher Testimonies of Favour than he had before in a State of Innocence, and to manifest fatherly Love and Kindness, in Promises of great Blessings? If this was the Case, God's Words to <HI>Adam</HI> must be understood thus:
<PB N="174" REF="008118_0194_0F6B57F071B2FDF0"/>
<Q>Because thou hast done so wickedly, hast hearken'd unto the Voice of thy Wise, and hast eaten of the Tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; therefore I will be more kind to thee than I was in thy State of Innocence, and do now appoint for thee the following great Favours: <HI>Cursed be the Ground for thy sake,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> And thus <HI>Adam</HI> must understand what was said; unless any will say (and God forbid that any should be so blasphemous) that God cloathed himself with Appearances of Displeasure, to deceive <HI>Adam,</HI> and make him believe the contrary of what he intended, and lead him to expect a dismal Train of Evils on his Posterity, con∣trary to all Reason and Justice, implying the most horribly unrighteous Treatment of Millions of perfectly innocent Creatures! 'Tis certain, there is not the least Appearance in what God said, or the Manner of it, as <HI>Moses</HI> gives us the Account, of any other, than that God was now testi∣fying Displeasure, condemning the Subject of the Sentence he was pronouncing, as justly exposed to Punishment for Sin, and for that Sin which he mentions.</P>
<P>When God was pronouncing this Sentence, <HI>Adam</HI> doubtless understood, that God had Respect to his Posterity, as well as Himself; tho' God spake wholly in the second Person singular, <HI>Because thou hast eaten,—In Sorrow shalt thou eat,—Unto the Dust shalt thou return.</HI> But he had as much Reason to understand God as having Re∣spect to his Posterity, when he directed his Speech to him in like Manner in the Threatning, <HI>Thou shalt surely die.</HI> The Sentence plainly refers to the Threatning, and results from it. The Threatning says, <HI>If thou eat, thou shalt die:</HI> The Sentence says, <HI>Because thou hast eaten, thou shalt die.</HI> And <HI>Moses,</HI> who wrote the Account, had no Reason to doubt but that the Affair would be thus under∣stood by his Readers; for such a Way of speaking was well understood in those Days: The History he gives us of the Origin of Things, abounds with it. Such a Man∣ner of speaking to the first of the Kind, or Heads of the Race, having Respect to the Progeny, is not only used in
<PB N="175" REF="008118_0195_0F6B57F08D6E3798"/>
almost every thing that God said to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> but even in what he said to the very <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Fishes,</HI> Gen. i. 22. And also in what he said afterwards to <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. ix. and to <HI>Shem, Ham</HI> and <HI>Japheth,</HI> and <HI>Canaan,</HI> Gen. ix. 25, 26, 27. So in Promises made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> in which God directed his Speech to him, and spake in he second Person singular, from Time to Time, but meant chiefly his Posterity: <HI>To thee will I give this Land. In thee shall all the Families of the Earth be blessed,</HI>&amp;c.&amp;c. And in what is said of <HI>Ishmael,</HI> as of his Person, but meant chiefly of his Posterity, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 12. and xvii. 20. And so in what <HI>Isaac</HI> said to <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> in his Blessing; in which he spake to them in the second Person singular; but meant chiefly their Posterity. And so for the most Part in the Promises made to <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob;</HI> and in <HI>Jacob's</HI> Blessing of <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh,</HI> and of his twelve Sons.</P>
<P>But I shall take Notice of one or two Things further shewing that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity were included in God's E∣stablishment with him, and the Threatning denounced for his Sin; and that the Calamities which come upon them in Consequence of his Sin, are brought on them as Punish∣ments.</P>
<P>This is evident from the <HI>Curse on the Ground;</HI> which if it be any Curse at all, comes equally on <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity with himself. And if it be a Curse, then against whom∣soever it is designed, and on whomsoever it terminates, it comes as a Punishment, and not as a Blessing, so far as it comes in Consequence of that Sentence.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> (P. 19.) says, <Q>A Curse is pronounced upon the Ground, but no Curse upon the Woman and the Man.</Q> And in P. 321, 322. He insists, that the Ground only was cursed, and not the Man: Just as tho' a Curse could ter∣minate on lifeless, senseless Earth! To understand this Curse otherwise than as terminating upon Man, thro' the Ground, would be as senseless as to suppose the Meaning to be, <HI>The Ground shall be punished, and shall be misera∣ble for thy sake.</HI> Our Author interprets the Curse on the
<PB N="176" REF="008118_0196_0F6B57F171F40660"/>
Ground, of it's being incumbred with noxious Weeds: But would these Weeds have been any Curse on the Ground, if there had been no Inhabitants, or if the Inha∣bitants had been of such a Nature, that these Weeds should not have been noxious, but useful to 'em? It is said, Deut. xxviii. 17. <HI>Cursed shall be thy Basket and thy Store:</HI> And would he not be thought to talk very ridiculously, who should say, 'Here is a Curse upon the Basket; but not a Word of any Curse upon the Owner: And therefore we have no Reason at all to look upon it as any Punishment upon him, or any Testimony of God's Displeasure towards him!' How plain is it, that when lifeless Things, which are not capable of either Benefit or Suffering, are said to be cursed or blessed with regard to sensible Beings, that use or possess these Things, or have Connection with them, the Meaning must be, that these sensible Beings are cursed or blessed <HI>in the other,</HI> or with respect to them? In Exod. xxiii. 25. 'tis said, <HI>He shall bless thy Bread &amp; thy Water.</HI> And I suppose, never any Body yet proceeded to such a Degree of Subtilty in distinguishing, as to say, 'Here is a Blessing on the Bread and the Water, which went into the Possessors Mouths, but no Blessing on them.' To make such a Distinction with regard to the Curse God pronounc'd on the Ground, would in some Respects be more unrea∣sonable, because God is express in explaining the Matter, declaring that it was <HI>for Man's sake,</HI> expresly referring this Curse to <HI>him,</HI> as being with Respect to him, and for the Sake of his Guilt; and as consisting in the Sorrow &amp; Suf∣fering he should have from it: <HI>In Sorrow shalt THOU eat of it—Thorns &amp; Thistles shall it bring forth TO THEE.</HI> So that God's own Words tell us where the Curse terminates. The Words are parallel with those in <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii. 16. but only more plain &amp; explicit, <HI>Cursed shalt THOU be in the Field,</HI> or in the Ground.</P>

of the sweet, but tempting, pernicious Fruits of Paradise, it might produce wholsome Fruits, more for the Health of the Soul; that it might bring forth Thorns &amp; Thistles, as excellent Medicines, to prevent or cure mortal Distem∣pers, Diseases which would issue in eternal Death; I say, if what was pronounced was under this Notion, then it was a Blessing on the Ground and not a Curse; and it might more properly have been said, '<HI>BLESSED shall the Ground be for thy sake,</HI>—I will make a happy Change in it, that it may be a Habitation more fit for a Creature so infirm, and so apt to be overcome with Temptation, as thou art.'</P>
<P>The Event makes it evident, that in pronouncing this Curse, God had as much Respect to <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, as to himself: And so it was understood by his pious Poste∣rity, before the Flood; as appears by what <HI>Lamech,</HI> the Father of <HI>Noah,</HI> says, Gen. v. 29. <HI>And he called his Name</HI> Noah; <HI>saying, This same shall comfort us concern∣ing our Work, and the Toil of our Hands,</HI> "because of the Ground which the Lord hath cursed."</P>
<P>Another Thing which argues, that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity were included in the Threatning of Death, and that our first Parents understood, when fallen, that the Tempter, in perswading them to eat the forbidden Fruit, had aimed at the Punishment and Ruin of both them and their Poste∣rity, &amp; had procured it, is <HI>Adam's</HI> immediately giving his Wife that new Name, <HI>Eve,</HI> or <HI>Life,</HI> on the Promise or Intimation of the Disappointment and Overthrow of the Tempter in that Matter, by her Seed; which <HI>Adam</HI> un∣derstood to be by his procuring Life; not only for them∣selves, but for many of their Posterity, and thereby deli∣vering them from that Death and Ruin which the Serpent had brought upon them. Those that should be thus deli∣vered, and obtain Life, <HI>Adam</HI> calls <HI>the Living:</HI> and be∣cause he observed, by what God had said, that Deliverance and Life was to be by the Seed of the Woman, he there∣fore remarks, that <HI>she is the Mother of all Living,</HI> and thereupon gives her a new Name, calls her <HI>Chavah,</HI> LIFE, Gen. iii. 20.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="008118_0198_0F6B57F2C7DEC158"/>There is a great deal of Evidence, that this is the Oc∣casion of <HI>Adams</HI> giving his Wife her new Name. This was her new Honour, &amp; the greatest Honour, at least in her present State, that the Redeemer was to be of her Seed. New Names were wont to be given for something that was the Persons peculiar Honour. So it was with regard to the new Names of <HI>Abraham, Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Israel.</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself (<HI>Key</HI> § 255.) observes, that they who are saved by Christ, are called the <HI>Livers,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (1 Cor. iv. 11.) <HI>The living,</HI> or, <HI>they that live.</HI> So we find in the old Testament, the Righteous are called by the name of <HI>the Living.</HI> Psal. lxix. 28. <HI>Let them be blotted out of the Book of the</HI> Living, <HI>and not be written with the Righteous.</HI> If what <HI>Adam</HI> meant by her being the <HI>Mother of all Living,</HI> was only her being the Mother of Mankind, and gave her the Name <HI>Life</HI> upon that Account, it were much the most likely that he would have given her this Name at first; when God first united them, under that Blessing. <HI>Be fruitful and multiply,</HI> and when he had a Prospect of her being the Mother of Mankind <HI>in a State of Immorta∣lity, living indeed, living</HI> and never <HI>dying.</HI> But that <HI>A∣dam</HI> should at that Time give her only the Name of <HI>Isha,</HI> and then immediately on that melancholy Change, by their coming under the <HI>Sentence of Death,</HI> with all their Poste∣rity, having now a new awful Prospect of her being the Mother of Nothing but a <HI>dying Race,</HI> all from Generation to Generation turning to Dust, thro' her Folly: I say, that immediately on this, he should change her Name into <HI>Life,</HI> calling her now the Mother of <HI>all living,</HI> is perfectly un∣accountable. Besides, it is manifest, that it was not her being the Mother of all Mankind, or <HI>her Relation</HI> as a Mother, which she stood in to her Posterity, but the <HI>Qua∣lity of those</HI> she was to be the Mother of, which was the Thing <HI>Adam</HI> had in View, in giving his Wife this new Name; as appears by the Name it self, which signifies <HI>Life.</HI> And if it had been only a natural and mortal Life which he had in View, this was Nothing distinguishing of
<PB N="179" REF="008118_0199_0F6B57F3D8421928"/>
her Posterity from the Brutes; for the very same Name of <HI>living</HI> ones, or <HI>living</HI> Things, is given from Time to Time in this Book of <HI>Genesis</HI> to them: As in <HI>Chap.</HI> i. 21, 24, 28. <HI>Chap.</HI> ii. 19. <HI>Chap.</HI> vi.19.—vii. 23. &amp; viii. 1. and many other Places in the Bible.—And besides, if <HI>by Life</HI> was not the Quality of her Posterity meant, there was nothing in it to distinguish her from <HI>Adam;</HI> for thus she was no more the Mother of all living, than he was the Fa∣ther of all living; and she could no more properly be called by the Name of <HI>Life</HI> on any such Account, than he: But Names are given for Distinction. Doubtless <HI>Adam</HI> took Notice of something distinguishing concerning her, that occasioned his giving her this new Name. And I think, it is exceeding natural to suppose, that as <HI>Adam</HI> had given her her <HI>first Name</HI> from the Manner of her <HI>Creation,</HI> so he gave her her <HI>new Name</HI> from <HI>Redemption,</HI> and as it were <HI>new Creation,</HI> thro' a Redeemer, of her Seed. And that he should give her this Name from that which comforted him, with respect to the Curse that God had pronounced on him and the Earth, as <HI>Lamech</HI> named <HI>Noah,</HI> (Gen. v. 29.) <HI>Saying, This same shall comfort us concern∣ing our Work, and Toil of our Hands, because of the Ground which the Lord hath cursed.</HI> Accordingly, he gave her this new Name, not at her first Creation, but im∣mediately after the Promise of a Redeemer, of her Seed. See <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15,—20.</P>
<P>Now as to the Consequence which I infer from <HI>Adam's</HI> giving his Wife this Name, on the Intimation which God had given, that <HI>Satan</HI> should by her Seed be overthrown and disappointed, as to his malicious Design, in that Deed of his which God then spake of, <HI>viz.</HI> his tempting the Wo∣man; <HI>Adam</HI> infers from it, that great Numbers of Man∣kind should be saved, whom he calls <HI>the Living;</HI> they should be saved from the Effects of this malicious Design of the old Serpent, and from that Ruin which he had brought upon them by tempting their first Parents to Sin; and so the Serpent would be, with respect to them, disappointed and overthrown in his Design. But how is any Death or
<PB N="180" REF="008118_0200_0F6B57F445435DC8"/>
Ruin, or indeed any Calamity at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by <HI>Satan'</HI>s Malice in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if instead of that, all the Death and Sorrow that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consequent, was the Fruit of God's fatherly Love, &amp; not <HI>Satan'</HI>s Malice, and was an Instance of God's free and sovereign Favour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Favour as <HI>Satan</HI> could not possibly foresee? And if Multitudes of <HI>Eve'</HI>s Posterity are saved, from either spiritual or temporal Death, by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of her Seed, how is that any Disappointment of <HI>Satan'</HI>s Design, in tempting our first Parents? How came he to have any such Thing in View, as the Death of <HI>Adam'</HI>s and <HI>Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'</HI>s Posterity by tempting them to Sin, or any Expectation that their Death would be the Consequence, unless he knew that they were included in the Threatning?</P>
<P>Some have objected against <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity's being included in the Threatning delivered to <HI>Adam,</HI> that the Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing itself was inconsistent with his <HI>having any Posterity:</HI> It being that he should die <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Day that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sinned.</HI></P>
<P>To this I answer, that the Threatning was not incon∣sistent with his having Posterity, on two Accounts:</P>
<P N="1">1. Those Words, <HI>In the Day thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest there of thou shalt surely die,</HI> according to the Use of such like Ex∣pressions among the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> don't signify immedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Death, or that the Execution shall be within twenty-four Hours from the Commission of the Fact; nor did God by those Words, limit himself as to the Time of ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuting the threaten'd Punishment; but that was still left to God's Pleasure. Such a Phrase, according to the Idi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, signifies no more than these two Things:</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>real Connection</HI> between the Sin and the Punish∣ment. So Ezek. xxxiii. 12, 13. <HI>The Righteousness of the Righteous shall not deliver him IN THE DAY of his Transgression. As for the Wicked<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss of the Wicked, He shall not fall thereby IN THE DAY that the turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th from his Wickedness: Neither shall the Righ∣teous be able to live IN THE DAY THAT HE SINNETH: But for his Iniquity that he hath com∣mitted,
<PB N="181" REF="008118_0201_0F6B57F5036F74A0"/>
HE SHALL DIE for it.</HI> Here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said, that <HI>in the Day</HI> he sinneth, he shall not be able to live, but he shall die; not signifying the Time when Death shall be executed upon him, but the Connection <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Sin &amp; Death; such a Connection as in our present com∣mon Use of Language is signified by the Adverb of Time. <HI>When;</HI> As if One should say, <Q>According to the Laws of our Nation, so long as a Man behaves Himself as a good Subject, he may live; but <HI>When</HI> he turns Rebel, he must die</Q>: Not signifying the Hour, Day or Month, in which he must be executed, but only the Connection between his Crime and Death.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing which seems to be signified by such an Expression, is, that <HI>Adam</HI> should be exposed <HI>to Death for one Transgression,</HI> without waiting on him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> try him the second Time. If he eat of that Tree, he should im∣mediately fall under Condemnation, tho' afterwards he might abstain ever so strictly. In this Respect, the Words are much of the same Force with those Words of <HI>Solomon</HI> to <HI>Shimei.</HI> 1 Kings ii. 37. <HI>For it shall be that</HI> ON THE DAY <HI>that thou goest out, and passest over the Brook</HI> Ki∣dron, <HI>thou shalt know for</HI> "certain, that thou shalt surely die." Not meaning, that he should certainly be exe∣cuted on that Day, but that he should be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to Death for the first Offence, and that he should not have another Trial, to see whether he would go over the Brook <HI>Kidron</HI> a second Time.</P>
<P>And then besides,</P>
<P N="2">II. If the Words had implied, that <HI>Adam</HI> should die that very Day, within 24 or 12 Hours, or that Moment that he transgress'd, yet it will by no Means follow, that God obliged himself to execute the Punishment <HI>in its ut∣most Extent</HI> on that Day. The Sentence was in great Part executed immediately; he then died spiritually; he lost his Innocence and original Righteousness, and the Fa∣vour of God; A dismal Alteration was made in his Soul, by the Loss of that holy divine Principle, which was in the highest Sense the Life of the Soul. In this he was truly
<PB N="182" REF="008118_0202_0F6B57F5C19234D8"/>
ruin'd and undone that very Day; becoming corrupt, mi∣serable and helpless. And I think it has been shown, that such a spiritual Death was one great Thing implied in the Thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tning.—And the Alteration then made in his Body and external State, was the Beginning of temporal Death, Grievous external Calamity is called by the Name of <HI>Death</HI> in Scripture, Exod. x. 17.—<HI>Intreat the Lord that he may take away this</HI> Death.—Not only was <HI>A∣dam's</HI> Soul ruin'd that Day, but his Body was ruin'd; it lost it's Beauty and Vigour, and became a poor dull, de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying, dying Thing. And besides all this, <HI>Adam</HI> was that Day undone in a more dreadful Sense: He immedi∣ately fell under the Curse of the Law, and Condemnation to eternal Perdition. In the Language of Scripture, he is <HI>dead,</HI> that is in a State of Condemnation to Death; ever as our Author often explains this Language in his Expo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion upon <HI>Romans.</HI> In Scripture-Language, he that be∣lieves in Christ, immediately receives Life. He passes at that Time from Death to Life, &amp; thenceforward (to use the Apostle <HI>John's</HI> Phrase) "has eternal Life abiding in him." But yet he don't then receive eternal Life in it's highest Completion; he has but the Beginnings of it; and receives it in a vastly greater Degree at Death: but the proper Time for the compleat Fulness is not till the Day of Judgment. When the Angels sinned, their Punishment was immediately executed in a Degree: But their full Punishment is not till the End of the World. And there is nothing in God's Threatning to <HI>Adam,</HI> that bound him to execute his full Punishment at once; nor any thing which determines, that he should have no Posterity. The Law or Constitution which God established and declared, determin'd, that if he sin'd, and had Posterity, he and they should die: But there was no Constitution determining concerning the actual Being of his Posterity in this Case; what Posterity he should have, how many, or whether any at all. All these Things God had reserved in his own Power: The Law and its Sanction intetmeddl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not with the Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="008118_0203_0F6B57F6817C3BD8"/>It may be proper in this Place also to take some Notice of that Objection of Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s against <HI>Adam's</HI> being supposed to be a federal Head for his Posterity, that it gives him greater H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nour than Christ, as it supposes that all his Posterity would have had eternal Life by his Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dience, if he had stood; and so a greater Number would have had the Benefit of his Obedience, than are saved by Christ. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 396, &amp;c.</NOTE>—I think, a very little Consideration is sufficient to shew, that there is no Weight in this Objection. For the Benefit of Christ's Merits may nevertheless be vastly beyond that which would have been by the Obedience of <HI>Adam.</HI> For those that are saved by Christ, are not meerly advanced to Happiness by his Merits, but are sa∣ved from the infinitely dreadful Effects of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, and many from immense Guilt, Pollution &amp; Misery by personal Sins; also brought to a holy &amp; happy State, as it were thro' infinite Obstacles; and are exalted to a far greater De∣gree of Dignity, Felicity &amp; Glory, than would have been due for <HI>Adam'</HI>s Obedience; for aught I know, many Thousand Times so great. And there is enough in the Gospel-Dispensation, clearly to manifest the Sufficiency of Christ's Merits for such Effects in all <HI>Mankind.</HI> And how great the Number will be, that shall <HI>actually</HI> be the Subjects of them, or how great a Proportion of the whole Race, considering the vast Success of the Gospel, that shall be in that future extraordinary, exempt, and glorious Sea∣son, often spoken of, none can tell. And the Hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of these two federal Heads arises not so much from what was proposed to each for his Trial, as from their Success, and the Good actually obtained; and also the Manner of ob∣taining: Christ obtains the Benefits Men have thro' him by proper Merit of Condignity, and a true Purchase by an E∣quivalent: which would not have been the Case with <HI>A∣dam,</HI> if he had obeyed.</P>
<P>I have now particularly considered the Account which <HI>Moses</HI> gives us in the Beginning of the Bible, of our first Parents, and God's Dealings with them, the Constitution
<PB N="184" REF="008118_0204_0F6B57F74A45F1A0"/>
he established with them, their Transgression, and what followed. And on the whole, if we consider the Manner in which God apparently speaks to <HI>Adam,</HI> from Time to Time; and particularly, if we consider how plainly and undeniably his Posterity are included in the Sentence of Death pronounced on <HI>Adam</HI> after his Fall, founded on the foregoing Threatning; and consider the Curse de∣nounc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on the Ground for his sake, and for his and his Posterity's Sorrow: And also consider what is evidently the Occasion of his giving his Wife the new Name of <HI>Eve,</HI> and his Meaning in it, and withal consider apparent Fact in constant and universal Events, with Relation to the State of our first Parents, and their Posterity from that Time forward, through all Ages of the World; I can't but think, it must appear to every impartial Person. that <HI>Moses's</HI> Account does, with sufficient Evidence, lead all Mankind, to whom his Account is communicated, to understand, that God, in his Constitution with <HI>Adam,</HI> dealt with him as a publick Person, and as the Head of the hu∣man Species, and had Respect to his Posterity, as included in him: And that this History is given by divine Direct∣ion, in the Beginning of the first-written Revelation, to exhibit to our View the Origin of the present sinful, mi∣serable State of Mankind, that we might see what that was, which first gave Occasion for all those consequent wonder∣ful Dispensations of divine Mercy &amp; Grace towards Man∣kind; which are the great Subject of the Scriptures, both of the old and new Testament; and that these Things are not obscurely and doubtfully pointed forth, but delivered in a plain Account of Things, which easily and naturally exhibits them to our Understandings.</P>
<P>And by what follows in this Discourse, we may have, in some Measure, Opportunity to see how other Things in the holy Scripture agree to what has been now observed from the three first Chapters of <HI>Genesis.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Observations on other Parts of the holy Scrip∣tures, chiefly in the Old Testament, that prove the Doctrine of Original Sin.</HEAD>
<P>ORiginal Depravity may well be argued from Wick∣edness being often spoken of in Scripture as a Thing <HI>belonging to the Race of Mankind, and as if it were a Property of the Species.</HI> So in Psal. xiv.2▪ 3. <HI>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the CHILDREN OF MEN, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside; they are altogether become filthy: There is none that dothGood; no, not one.</HI> The like we have again, Psal. Liii▪ 2,3.—Dr.<HI>T.</HI> says, <Q>The holy Spirit don't mean this of every Individual; because in the very same Psalm. He speaks of some that were righteous. v. 5. <HI>God is in the Generation of the Righ∣teous.</HI></Q> But how little is this Observation to the Purpose? For who ever supposed, that no unrighteous Men were ever changed by divine Grace, and afterwards made righ∣teous? The Psalmist is speaking of what Men are as they are the <HI>Children of Men,</HI> born of the corrupt human Race; and not as born of God, whereby they come to be the Children of God, and of the <HI>Generation of the Righ∣teous.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> cites this Place in Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii. 10, 11, 12. to prove the universal Corruption of Mankind; but yet in the same Chapter he supposes, these same Per∣sons here spoken of as Wicked, may become righteous, thro' the Righteousness and Grace of God.</P>
<P>So Wickedness is spoken of in other Places in the Book of Psalms, as a Thing that <HI>belongs to Men, as of the human Race, as Sons of Men.</HI> Thus, in Psal. iv. 2: <HI>O ye</HI> Sons of Men, <HI>how long will ye turn my Glory into Shame? How long will ye love Vanity</HI> &amp;c? Psal. lvii. 4.—<HI>I lie among them that are set on Fire,</HI> even the Sons of Men, <HI>whose Teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their Tongue a sharp Sword.</HI> Psal. lviii. 1, 2. <HI>Do ye indeed speak
<PB N="186" REF="008118_0206_0F6B57FA83CF8278"/>
Righteousness, O Congregation? Do ye judge uprightly,</HI> O ye Sons of Men? <HI>Yea, in Heart ye work Wickedness; ye weigh out the Violence of your Hands in the Earth.</HI> Our Author mentioning these Places, says, <Q>There was a strong Party in <HI>Israel</HI> disaffected to <HI>David's</HI> Person and Government, and sometimes he chuseth to denote them by the Sons or Children of Men.</Q> But it would have been worth his while to have enquired, <HI>Why</HI> the Psalmist <HI>should chuse to denote</HI> the wickedest and worst Men in <HI>Israel</HI> by this Name? Why he should chuse thus to dis∣grace the human Race, as if the Compellation of Sons of Men most properly belonged to such as were of the vilest Character, and as if all the Sons of Men, even every one of them, were of such a Character, and none of them did good; no, not one? Is it not strange, that the Righteous should not be thought worthy to be called <HI>Sons of Men,</HI> and ranked with that noble Race of Beings, who are born into the World wholly right and innocent! It is a good, easy &amp; natural Reason why he chuseth to call the Wicked <HI>Sons of Men,</HI> as a proper Name for 'em, That by being of the Sons of Men, or of the corrupt ruin'd Race of Man∣kind, they come by their Depravity. And the Psalmist himself leads us to this very Reason, Psal. lviii. at the Beginning. <HI>Do ye judge uprightly,</HI> O ye Sons of Men? <HI>yea, in Heart ye work Wickedness, ye weigh out the Vio∣lence of your Hands. The Wicked are</HI> estranged from the Womb,&amp;c. Of which I would speak more by &amp; by.</P>
<P>Agreable to these Places, is Prov. xxi. 8. <HI>The Way of</HI> MAN <HI>is froward and strange; but as for the pure, his Work is right.</HI> He that is perverse in his Walk, is here called by the Name of <HI>Man,</HI> as distinguished from the pure: which I think is absolutely unaccountable, if all Mankind by Nature are pure, and perfectly innocent, and all such as are froward and strange in their Ways, therein depart from the native Purity of all Mankind. The Words naturally lead us to suppose the contrary; that Depravity and Perverseness properly belong to Mankind as they are naturally, and that a Being made pure, is by an After∣work,
<PB N="187" REF="008118_0207_0F6B57FB33D593B8"/>
work, by which some are delivered from native Pollution, and distinguished from Mankind in general: Which is per∣fectly agreable to the Representation in Rev. xiv.4. Where we have an Account of a Number that <HI>were not defiled,</HI> but were pure, and <HI>following the Lamb,</HI> of whom it is said, <HI>These were REDEEMED FROM AMONG MEN.</HI></P>
<P>To these Things agree, Jer. xvii. 5, 9. In the 5 v. it is said, <HI>Cursed is he that trusteth in MAN.</HI> And in the 9th v. this Reason is given, <HI>The Heart is deceitful a∣bove all Things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?</HI> What Heart is this so wicked and deceitful? Why, <HI>evidently the Heart of him who, it was said before, we must not trust;</HI> and that is <HI>MAN.</HI> It alters not the Case as to the present Argument, whether the Deceitful∣ness of the Heart here spoken of, be its Deceitfulness to the Man himself, or to others. So that fore-mention'd Eccl. ix. 3. <HI>Madness is in the Heart of the</HI> SONS OF MEN, <HI>while they live.</HI> And those Words of Christ to <HI>Peter,</HI> Matth. xvi. 23. <HI>Get thee behind me, Satan—For thou savourest not the Things that be of God, but the Things that be</HI> of MEN. Signifying plainly, that to be carnal and vain, and opposite to what is spiritual and divine, is what properly belongs to <HI>Men</HI> in their present State. The same thing is supposed in that of the Apostle, 1 Cor. iii. 3. <HI>For ye are yet carnal. For where as there is among you Envying and Strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as MEN?</HI> And that in Hos. vi. 7. <HI>But they like</HI> MEN, <HI>have transgressed the Covenant.</HI> To these Pla∣ces may be added, Matth. vii. 11. <HI>If</HI> ye being Evil, <HI>know how to give good Gifts</HI>—Jam. iv. 5. <HI>Do ye think that the Scripture faith in vain, The Spirit that</HI> dwelleth in us, lus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth to Envy?—1 Pet. iv.2. <HI>That he no longer should live the rest of his Time in the Lusts of MEN,</HI> but to the Will of God.—Yet above all, that in Job xv.16. <HI>How much more abominable and filthy is MAN,</HI> "who drink∣eth Iniquity like Water?" Of which more presently.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="008118_0208_0F6B57FBC4502FE0"/>Now what Account can be given of these Things, on Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme? How strange is it, that we should have such Descriptions, all over the Bible of MAN, and THE SONS OF MEN! Why should Man be so conti∣nually spoken of as evil, carnal, perverse, deceitful, and desperately Wicked, if all Men are by Nature as perfectly innocent, and free from any Propensity to Evil, as <HI>Adam</HI> was the first Moment of his Creation, all <HI>made right,</HI> as our Author would have us understand Eccl. vii. 29? Why, on the contrary, is it not said, at least as often, and with equal Reason; that <HI>The Heart of Man is right and pure;</HI> that <HI>The Way of Man is innocent and holy;</HI> and that <HI>he who savours true Virtue and Wisdom, savours the Things that be of Men?</HI> Yea, and why might it not as well have been said, <HI>The Lord looked down from Heaven on the Sons of Men, to see if there were any that did understand, and did seek after God; and they were all right, altogether pure, there was none inclined to do Wickedness, no, not one!</HI></P>
<P>Of the like import with the Texts mention'd, are those which represent Wickedness as what properly belongs to the WORLD; and that they who are otherwise, are <HI>saved from the World,</HI> and <HI>called out of it.</HI> As, Joh vii. 7. <HI>The WORLD cannot hate you; but me it hateth; because I testify of it, that the Works there of are evil.</HI> Chap. viii. 23. <HI>Ye are of this WORLD: I am not of this WORLD</HI> Chap. xiv. 17. <HI>The Spirit of Truth, whom the WORLD cannot receive; because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: But ye know him.</HI> Chap. xv. 18, 19. <HI>If the WORLD hate you, ye know that it hated me be∣fore it hated you. If ye were of the WORLD, the WORLD would love its own: But because ye are not of the WORLD, but I have chosen you out of the WORLD, therefore the WORLD hateth you.</HI> Rev. xiv. 3, 4. <HI>These are they which were redeemed from the EARTH,—redeemed from among Men.</HI> Joh. xvii. 9. <HI>I pray not for the WORLD, but for them which thou hast given me.</HI> v. 14. <HI>I have given them thy Word; and
<PB N="189" REF="008118_0209_0F6B57FCD72308E0"/>
the WORLD hath hated them, because they are not of the WORLD, even as I am not of the WORLD,</HI> 1 Joh. iii. 13. <HI>Marvel not my Brethren, if the WORLD hate you.</HI> Chap. iv. 5. <HI>They are of the WORLD, therefore speak they of the WORLD, and the WORLD heareth them.</HI> Chap. v. 19. <HI>We are of God, and the whole WORLD lieth in Wickedness.</HI> 'Tis evident, that in these Places, by the World is meant the World of Man∣kind; not the Habitation, but the Inhabitants. For, 'tis the World spoken of as <HI>loving, hating, doing evil Works, speaking hearing</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It shews the same Thing, that Wickedness is often spoken of as being Man's OWN, in Contradistinction from Virtue &amp; Holiness. So Men's Lusts are often called their own Heart's Lusts, and their practising Wickedness is called walking in their own Ways, walking in their own Counsels, in the Imagination of their OWN Heart, and in the Sight their OWN Eyes, according to their OWN Devices &amp;c. These Things denote Wickedness to be a Quality belong∣ing properly to the Character and Nature of Mankind, in their present State: As, when Christ would represent that Lying is remarkably the Character and the very Nature of the Devil in his present State, he expresses it thus, (Joh. viii.44.) "When he speaketh a <HI>Lye,</HI> he speaketh of his OWN; For he is a Liar, and the Father of it."</P>
<P>And that Wickedness belongs to the Nature of Man∣kind in their present State, may be argued from those Places which speak of Mankind as being wicked <HI>in their Childhood,</HI> or <HI>from their Childhood.</HI> So, that in Prov. xxii. 15. <HI>Foolishness is bound in the Heart of a Child; but the Rod of Correction shall drive it far from him.</HI> Nothing is more manifest, than that the Wise man in this Book continually uses the Word Folly, or Foolishness, for Wickedness: And that this is what he means in this Place, the Words themselves do shew: For the Rod of Correction is proper to drive away no other Foolishness, but that which is of a moral Nature. The Word render'd <HI>Bound</HI> signifies, as is observed in <HI>Pool's Synopsis,</HI> a close &amp; firm

Union. The same Word is used in Chap. vi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. Bind <HI>them continually upon thine Heart.</HI> And Ch. vii. 3. Bind <HI>them upon thy Fingers, write them upon the Table of thine Heart.</HI> To the like Purpose is Chap. iii. 3. and Deut. xi. 18. where this Word is used. The same Verb is used, 1 Sam. xviii. 1. <HI>The Soul of</HI> Jonathan <HI>was</HI> knit (or bound) <HI>to the Soul of</HI> David, <HI>and</HI> Jonathan <HI>loved him as his own Soul.</HI>—But how comes Wickedness to be so firmly bound, and strongly fix'd, in the Hearts of Chil∣dren, if it be not there naturally? They having had no Time firmly to fix Habits of Sin by long Custom in actual Wickedness, as those that have lived many Years in the World.</P>
<P>The same Thing is signified in that noted Place, Gen. viii.21. <HI>For the Imagination of Man's Heart is evil</HI> "from his Youth."—It alters not the Case, whether it be translated <HI>For,</HI> or <HI>Though</HI> the Imagination of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> would have it; still the Words suppose it to be so as is said. The Word translated <HI>Youth,</HI> signifies the whole of the former Part of the Age of Man, which commences from the Beginning of Life. The Word in its Derivation, has Reference to the Birth, or Beginning of Existence. It comes from <HI>Nagnar,</HI> which signifies to shake off, as a Tree shakes off its ripe Fruit, or a Plant its Seed:—the Birth of Children being commonly represented by a Tree's yielding Fruit, or a Plant's yielding Seed. So that the Word here translated <HI>Youth,</HI> comprehends not only what we in <HI>English</HI> most commonly call the Time of Youth, but also Childhood and Infancy, and is very often used to signify these latter. A Word of the same Root is used to signify a <HI>young Child,</HI> or a <HI>little Child,</HI> in the following Places; 1 Sam. i. 24▪ 25, 27. 1 Kin. iii. 7. and xi. 17. 2 Kin. ii. 23. Job xxxiii. 25. Prov. xxii. 6. and xxiii. 13. and xxix. 21. Isai. x. 19. and xi. 6. and lxv. 29. Jer. x. 6. Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. xi. 1. The same Word is used to signify an <HI>Infant,</HI> in Exod. ii. 6. &amp; x. 9. Judg. xiii. 5, 7, 8. and xii. 24. 1 Sam. i. 22. and iv. 21. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kin. v. 14. Isai. vii. 16▪ and viii. 4.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="008118_0211_0F6B57FE0DFA6268"/>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says (P. 124.) that he <Q>conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>From the Youth,</HI> is a Phrase signifying the Greatness, or long Duration of a Thing.</Q> But if by long Duration he means any Thing else than what is literally express'd, <HI>viz.</HI> from the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣ning of Life, he has no Reason to conceive so; neither has what he offers, so much as the Shadow of a Reason for his Conception. There is no Appearance in the Words of the two or three Texts he mentions, of their meaning any thing else than what is most literally signified.—And 'tis certain, that what he suggests, is not the ordinary Import of such a Phrase among the <HI>Hebrews:</HI> But that thereby is meant, from the Beginning, or early Time of Life, or Existence; as may be seen in the Places following, where the same Word in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is used, as in this Place by the eighth of <HI>Genesis.</HI> 1 Sam. xii. 2. <HI>I am old, and gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y∣headed—and I have walked before you from my</HI> Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣hood, <HI>unto this Day:</HI> where the original Word is the same, Psal. lxxi. 5,6. <HI>Thou art my Trust</HI> from my Youth: <HI>By thee have I been holden up from the Womb. Thou art he that took me out of my Mother's Bowels.</HI> v. 17, 18. <HI>O God, thou hast taught me</HI> from my Youth; and <HI>hitherto have I declared thy wondrous Works: Now also, when I am old and gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y-headed, forsake me not.</HI> Psal. cxxix. 1, 2. <HI>Many a time have they afflicted me</HI> from my Youth, <HI>may</HI> Israel <HI>now say: many a Time have they afflicted me</HI> from my Youth; <HI>yet have they not pre∣vailed against me.</HI> Isai. xlvii. 12. <HI>Stand now with the Multitude of thy Sorceries, wherein th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hast laboured</HI> from thy Youth. So v. 15. and 2 Sam. xix. 7. <HI>That will be worse unto thee, than all the Evil that befel thee</HI> from thy Youth, <HI>until now.</HI> Jer. iii. 24, 25. <HI>Shame hath devoured the Labour of our Fathers,</HI> from our Youth.—<HI>We have sin'd against the Lord our God,</HI> from our Youth, <HI>even to this Day.</HI> So Jer. xxxii. 30. &amp; xlviii. 11. Job xxxi. 18. Gen. xlvi. 34. Ezek. iv. 14. Zech. xiii. 5.</P>
<P>And it is to be observed, that according to the Manner of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, when it is said, such a thing has been <HI>from Youth,</HI> or the first Part of Existence, the Phrase
<PB N="192" REF="008118_0212_0F6B57FECB68E218"/>
is to be understood as including that first Time of Exist∣ence. So, Josh. vi. 21. <HI>They Utterly destroyed all, from the Young to the Old</HI> (so it is in the <HI>Hebrew</HI>) i. e. including both. So Esth. iii. 13. and Gen. xix. 4.</P>
<P>And as Mankind are represented in Scripture, as being of a wicked Heart <HI>from their Youth,</HI> so in other Places they are spoken of as being thus <HI>from the Womb</HI> Psal. lviii. 3. <HI>The Wicked are estranged</HI> from the Womb: <HI>They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking Lies.</HI> 'Tis observable, that the Psalmist mentions, this as what belongs to the Wicked, as the SONS OF MEN: for, these are the proceeding Words; "<HI>Do ye judge uprightly,</HI> O ye Sons of Men?—Yea, in Heart ye work Wickedness." (A Phrase of the like Import with that in Gen. viii. 21. <HI>The Imagination,</HI> or Operation, as it might have been render'd, of his Heart is evil.) Then it follows. <HI>The Wicked are estranged</HI> from the Womb, &amp;c. The next Verse is, <HI>Their Poison is like the Poison of a Serpent.</HI> 'Tis so remarkably, as the very Nature of a Serpent is Poison: Serpents are poisonous as soon as they come into the World: They derive a poisonous Nature by their Ge∣neration.—Dr.<HI>T.</HI>(P. 134, 135.) says, <Q>'Tis evident that this is a scriptural figurative Way of aggravating Wick∣edness, on the one Hand, and Virtue on the other, to speak of it as being <HI>from the Womb.</HI></Q> And as an In∣stance of the latter, he cites that in Isai. xlix. 1. <HI>The Lord hath called me</HI> from the Womb; <HI>from the Bowels of my Mother, he made Mention of my Name.</HI> But I apprehend, that in order to <HI>seeing</HI> this to be <HI>evident,</HI> which he asserts, a Man must have Eyes peculiarly affected. I humbly conceive, that such Phrases as that in the 49th of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> of God's calling the Prophet <HI>from the Womb,</HI> are <HI>evidently,</HI> not of the Import which he supposes; but mean truly from the Beginning of Existence, and are manifestly of like Signification with that which is said of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Jer. i. 5. <HI>Before I formed thee in the Womb; I know thee: Before thou camest out of the Womb, I sanctified thee, and ordained thee a Prophet of the Na∣tions.</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="008118_0213_0F6B57FF8DB44530"/>
Which surely means something else besides a high Degree of Virtue: It plainly signifies that he was, from his first Existence, set apart by God for a Prophet. And it would be as unreasonable to understand it otherwise, as to suppose, the Angel meant any other than that <HI>Sam∣son</HI> was set apart to be a Nazarite from the Beginning of his Life, when he says to his Mother, <HI>Behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a Son: and now drink no Wine, nor strong Drink,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For the Child shall be a Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣rite to God,</HI> from the Womb, <HI>to the Day of his Death.</HI> By these Instances it is plain, that the Phrase, <HI>From the Womb,</HI> as the other, <HI>From the Youth,</HI> as used in Scripture, properly signifies from the Beginning of Life.</P>
<P>Very remarkable is that Place, Job xv. 14, 15, 16. <HI>What is Man, that he should be clean? And he that is</HI> born of a Woman, <HI>that he should be righteous? Behold, he putteth no Trust in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aints; yea, the Heavens are not clean in his Sight: How much more abominable and filthy is Man, which drinketh Iniquity like Water?</HI> And no less remarkable is our Author's Method of managing of it. The 16th v. expresses an exceeding Degree of Wickedness, in as plain and emphatical Terms, almost, as can be invented; every Word representing this in the strong∣est Manner: <HI>How much more abominable and filthy is Man, that drinketh Iniquity like Water?</HI> I can't now recollect, where we have a Sentence equal to it, in the whole Bible, for an emphatical, lively &amp; strong Representation of great Wickedness of Heart. Any one of the Words, as such Words are used in Scripture, would represent great Wicked∣ness: If it had been only said, <HI>How much more abominable is Man?</HI> Or, <HI>How much more filthy is Man?</HI> Or, <HI>Man drinketh Iniquity.</HI>—But all these are accumulated, with the Addition of—<HI>like Water,</HI>—the further to represent the Boldness or Greediness of Men, in Wickedness: Tho' Iniquity be the most deadly Poison, yet Men drink it as boldly as they drink Water, are as familiar with it as with their common Drink, and drink it with like Greediness, as he that is thirsty drinks Water. That Boldness &amp; Eager∣ness
<PB N="194" REF="008118_0214_0F6B580044A19F88"/>
in persecuting the Saints, by which the great Degree of the Depravity of Man's Heart often appears, is repre∣sented thus (Psal. xiv. 4.) <HI>Have the Workers of Iniquity no Knowledge, who eat up my People,</HI> "as they eat Bread?" And the greatest Eagerness of Thirst is represented by thirsting as an Animal thirsts after Water, Psal. X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii. 1.</P>
<P>Now let us see the soft, easy, light Manner, in which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> treats this Place. P. 143. <Q><HI>How much more abo∣minable and filthy is Man,</HI> IN COMPARISON OF THE DIVINE PURITY, "who drinketh I∣niquity like Water"? Who is attended with so many sensual Appetites, and so apt to indulge them. You see the Argument; Man in his present weak, and fleshly State, cannot be clean before God. Why so? Because he is conceived and born in Sin, by Reason of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin? No such thing. But because the purest Crea∣tures are not pure <HI>in Comparison of God.</HI> Much less a Being subject to so many INFIRMITIES, as a MORTAL Man. Which is a Demonstration to Me, not only, that <HI>Job</HI> and his Friends did not intend to estab∣lish the Doctrine we are now examining, but that they were wholly Strangers to it.</Q> Thus this Author en∣deavours to reconcile this Text with his Doctrine of the perfect native Innocence of Mankind: In which we have a notable Specimen of his <HI>Demonstrations,</HI> as well as of that great Impartiality and Fairness in examining and ex∣pounding the Scripture, which he makes so often a Pro∣fession of.</P>
<P>In this Place we are not only told, how wicked Man's Heart is, but also how Men come by such Wickedness; even by being of the Race of Mankind, by ordinary Gene∣ration: <HI>What is Man, that he should be clean? and he that is born of a Woman, that he should be righteous?</HI> Our Author (P. 141, 142.) represents Man's being born of a Woman, as a <HI>Periphrasis,</HI> to signify Man; and that there is no Design in the Words to give a Reason, why Man is not clean and righteous. But the Case is most evidently other∣wise, if we may interpret the Book of <HI>Job</HI> by itself: 'Tis
<PB N="195" REF="008118_0215_0F6B58010D7F7990"/>
most plain, that Man's being <HI>born of a Woman</HI> is given as a Reason of his not being clean; Chap. xiv. 4. <HI>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? Job</HI> is speaking there expresly of Man's being born of a Woman, as appears in v. 1. And here how plain is it, that this is given as a Reason of Man's not being clean? Concerning this Dr.<HI>T.</HI> says, <HI>That this has no respect to any moral Uncleanness, but only common Frailty,</HI> &amp;c. But how evidently i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this also otherwise? when that Uncleanness which a Man had by being born of a Woman, is expresly explain'd of <HI>Un∣righteousness,</HI> in the next Chapter at the 14th v. <HI>What is Man, that he should be clean? and he that is born of a Woman, that he should be RIGHTEOUS?</HI> And also is Chap. xxv. 4. <HI>How then can Man be justified with God? And how can be he clean, that is born of a Woman?</HI> 'Tis a moral Cleanness <HI>Bildad</HI> is speaking of, which a Man needs in order to being <HI>justified.</HI>—His Design is, to con∣vince <HI>Job</HI> of his moral Impurity, &amp; from thence of God's Righteousness in his severe Judgments upon him; and not of his natural Frailty.</P>
<P>And without Doubt, <HI>David</HI> has respect to this same Way of Derivation of Wickedness of Heart, when he says, Psal. li. 5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> It alters not the Case as to the Argument we are upon, whether the Word translated <HI>conceive,</HI> signify conceive, or nurse; which latter, our Author takes so much Pains to prove: For when he has done all, he speaks of it as a just Translation of the Words to render 'em thus, <HI>I was BORN in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother nurse me.</HI> (P. 135.) If it is own'd that Man is <HI>born in Sin,</HI> 'tis not worth the while to dis∣pute, whether 'tis expresly asserted, that he is <HI>conceived</HI> in <HI>Sin.</HI> But Dr. <HI>T.</HI> after his Manner insists, that such Expressions, as being <HI>born in Sin,</HI> being <HI>Transgressors from the Womb,</HI> and the like, are only Phrases figurative∣ly to denote Aggravation, and high Degree of Wicked∣ness. But the contrary has been already demonstrated, from many plain Scripture-Instances.—Nor is one Instance
<PB N="196" REF="008118_0216_0F6B5801C0A53110"/>
produced, in which there is any Evidence that such a Phrase is used in such a Manner. A poetical Sentence out of <HI>Virgil'</HI>s <HI>Aen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ids,</HI> has here been produced, and made much of by some, as parallel with this, in what <HI>Dido</HI> says to <HI>AEneas,</HI> in these Lines:</P>
<P>Nec tibi Diva Parens Generis, nec Dardanus Author,</P>
<P>Perfide: Sed duris genuit teCautibus horrens</P>
<P>Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sus, Hyrcanoeque admôunt Ubera Tigres.</P>
<P>In which she tells <HI>AEneas,</HI> that not a Goddess was his Mo∣ther, nor <HI>Anchises</HI> his Father; but that he had been bro't forth by a horrid rocky Mountain, and nursed at the Dugs of Tygers, to represent the Greatness of his Cruelty to her. But how unlike and unparallel is this: Nothing could be more natural, than for a Woman overpower'd with the Passion of Love, and distracted with raging Jea∣lousy and Disappointment, thinking herself treated with brutish Perfidy and Cruelty, by a Lover whose highest Fame had been his being the Son of a Goddness, to aggra∣vate his Inhumanity and Hard-heartedness with this, That his Behaviour was not worthy the Son of a Goddess, nor becoming one whose Father was an illustrious Prince; and that he acted more as if he had been brought forth by hard unrelenting Rocks, and had sucked the Dugs of Tyg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. But what is there in the Case of <HI>David,</HI> parallel, or at all in like Manner leading him to speak of himself as born in Sin, in any such Sense? He is not speaking him∣self, nor any one else speaking to him, of any excellent and divine Father and Mother, that he was born of: Nor is there any Appearance of his aggravating his Sin, by its being unworthy of his high Birth. There is nothing else visible in <HI>David's</HI> Case, to lead him to take Notice of his being <HI>born in Sin,</HI> but only his having such Experience of the Continuance and Power of indwelling Sin, after so long a Time, and so many and great Means to engage him to Holiness; which shew'd, that Sin was inbred, and in his very Nature.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> very often objects to these and other Texts, brought by Divines to prove original Sin, that there is no

Mention made in them of <HI>Adam,</HI> nor of his Sin. He cries out, <HI>Here is not the least Mention, or Intimation of</HI> Adam, <HI>or any ill Effects of his Sin upon us.—Here's not one Word, nor the least Hint of</HI> Adam, <HI>or any Con∣sequences of his Sin,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 5. 64, 96, 97, 98, 102, 108, 112, 118, 120, 122, 123, 127, 128, 136, 142, 143, 152, 155, 229, 149.</NOTE> He says, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">142.</NOTE> <Q>If <HI>Job</HI> and his Friends had known and believed the Doctrine of a corrupt Nature, derived from <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin only, they ought in Reason and Truth to have given this as the true and only Reason of the human Imperfection and Uncleanness they mention.</Q> But these Objections and Exclamations are made no less impertinently, than they are frequently. 'Tis no more a Proof, that Corruption of Nature did not come by <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, because many times when it is mentioned, <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin is not expresly m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion'd as the Cause of it, than that Death did not come by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin (as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says it did) because tho' Death as incident to Mankind, is mentioned so often in the old Testament, and by our Saviour in his Discourses yet <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin is not once expresly mentioned, after the three first Chapters of <HI>Genesis,</HI> any where in all the old Testament, or the four Evangelists, as the Occasion of it.</P>
<P>What Christian has there ever been, that believed the moral Corruption of the Nature of Mankind, who ever doubted that it came that Way, which the Apostle speaks of, when he says, "<HI>By one Man</HI> Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin"? Nor indeed have they any more Reason to doubt of it, than to doubt of the whole History of our first Parents, because <HI>Adam's</HI> Name is so rarely mention'd, on any Occasion in Scripture, after that first Account of him, &amp; <HI>Eve's</HI> never at all; and because we have no more any express Mention of the particular Manner, in which Mankind were first brought into Being, either with respect to the Creation of <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Eve.</HI> 'Tis sufficient, that the abiding, most visible Effects of these Things remain, in the View of Mankind in all Ages, and are often spoken of in Scripture; and the particular Manner of their being

introduced, is once plainly set forth in the Beginning of the Bible, in that History which gives us an Account of the Origin of all Things. And doubtless it was expected, by the great Author of the Bible, that the Account in the three first Chapters of <HI>Genesis</HI> should be taken as a plain Account of the Introduction of both natural and moral Evil, into the World; as it has been shewn to be so in∣deed. The History of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, with its Circumstan∣ces, God's Threatning, and the Sentence pronounced up∣on him after his Transgression, and the immediate Conse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uences, consisting in so vast an Alteration in his State, and the State of the World, which abides still, with respect to all his Posterity, do most directly and sufficiently lead to an understanding of the Rise of Calamity, Sin &amp; Death, in this sinful miserable, World.</P>
<P>'Tis fit, we all should know, that it don't become us to tell the most High, how often he shall particularly explain and give the Reason of any Doctrine which he teaches in order to our believing what he says. If he has at all given us Evidence that it is a Doctrine agreable to his Mind, it becomes us to receive it with full Credit and Submission; and not sullenly to reject it, because our Notions and Humours are not suited in the Manner, and Number of Times, of his particularly explaining it to us. How often is Pardon of Sins promis'd in the Old Testa∣ment to repenting and returning Sinners? How many hundred Times is God's special Favour there promised to the sincerely Righteous, without any express Mention of these Benefits being thro' Christ? Would it therefore be becoming us to say, that in-as-much as our Dependence on Christ for these Benefits, is a Doctrine, which, if true, is of such Importance, that God ought expresly to have men∣tion'd Christ's Merits as the Reason and Ground of the Benefits, if he knew they were the Ground of 'em, and should have plainly declar'd it sooner, and more frequent∣ly, if ever he expected we should believe him, when he did tell us of it?—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often is Vengeance and Misery threaten'd in the old Testament to the Wicked, without

<P>THose Words of Christ, giving a Reason to <HI>Nicode∣mus,</HI> why we must be born again, Joh. iii. 6. <HI>That which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit;</HI> have not without good Rea∣son been produced by Divines, as a Proof of the Doctrine of Original Sin: supposing, that by <HI>Flesh</HI> here is meant <HI>the human Nature in a debased and corrupt State.</HI> Yet Dr.<HI>T.</HI>(P. 144.) thus explains these Words, <HI>That which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh;</HI> <Q>That which is born by na∣tural Descent and Propagation, is a Man consisting of Body and Soul, or the meer Constitution and Powers of a Man, in their natural State.</Q> But the constant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these Terms, <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> in other Parts of the New Testament, when thus set in Opposition one to ano∣ther, and the latter said to be produced by the Spirit of God,

as here; and when speaking of the same Thing, which Christ is here speaking of to <HI>Nicodemus, viz.</HI> the requisite Qua∣lifications to Salvation, this will fully vindicate the Sense of our Divines. Thus in the 7th &amp; 8th Chapters of <HI>Romans,</HI> where these Terms <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) are abundantly repeated, and set in Opposition, as here. So, Chap. vii. 14. <HI>The Law is</HI> spiritual (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) but I am carnal, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) sold under Sin. He can't only mean, 'I am <HI>a Man, consisting of Body and Soul, and having the Powers of a Man.'</HI> Ver. 18. <HI>I know that in me, that is, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> Flesh, <HI>dwelleth no good thing.</HI> He don't mean to condemn his Frame, <HI>as consisting of Body and Soul;</HI> and to assert, that in his <HI>human Constitution, with the Powers of a Man,</HI> dwells no good thing. And when he says in the last Verse of the Chapter, <HI>With the Mind I my self serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Law of God, but with the</HI> Flesh <HI>the Law of Sin;</HI> He can't mean, <HI>'I my self serve the Law of God;</HI> but with my innocent <HI>human Constitution, as hav∣ing the Powers of a Man,</HI> I serve the Law of Sin.' And when he says in the next Words, in the Beginning of the 8th Chapter, <HI>There is no Condemnation to them—that walk not after the</HI> Flesh, <HI>but after the</HI> Spirit; and ver. 4. <HI>The Righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh;</HI> He can't mean, 'There is no Con∣demnation to them that walk not according to <HI>the Powers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man,'</HI> &amp;c. And when he says, ver. 5,&amp; 6. <HI>They that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the</HI> Flesh, <HI>do mind the things of the</HI> Flesh; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>to be</HI> carnally <HI>minded is Death;</HI> He don't intend, 'They that are according to <HI>the human Constitution and</HI> the <HI>Powers of a Man,</HI> do mind the Things of the <HI>human Con∣stitution and Powers;</HI> and to mind these, is Death.' And when he says, ver. 7,&amp; 8. <HI>The carnal</HI> (or fleshly) <HI>Mind is Enmity against God, and is not subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be; So that they that are in the</HI> Flesh, <HI>can∣not please God;</HI> He can't mean, that to mind the Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> which are agreable to the <HI>Powers and Constitution of a Man</HI> (who, as our Author says, is constituted or made right) is Enmity against God; And that a Mind which is
<PB N="201" REF="008118_0221_0F6B580962EF2938"/>
agreable to this right human Constitution, as God hath made it, is not subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be; and that they who are according to such a Constitution, cannot please God. And when it is said, v. 9. <HI>Ye are not in the</HI> Flesh, <HI>but in the</HI> Spirit; the Apostle can't mean, Ye are not in the <HI>human Nature, as constituted of Body and Soul, and with the Powers of a Man.</HI> 'Tis most manifest, that by the <HI>Flesh</HI> here the Apostle means some Nature that is corrupt, and of an evil Tendency, and directly opposite to the Law, and holy Nature of God; so that to be and walk according to it, and to have a Mind conformed to it, is to be an utter Enemy to God and his Law, in a perfect Inconsistence with being subject to God, and pleasing God; and in a sure infallible Tendency to Death, and utter Destruction. And it is plain, that here by <HI>being</HI> and <HI>walking after,</HI> or according to the <HI>Flesh,</HI> is meant the same thing as being and walk∣ing according to a corrupt and sinful Nature; and to be and walk according to the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is to be and walk ac∣cording to a holy and divine Nature, or Principle: and to be <HI>carnally</HI> minded, is the same as being viciously and corruptly minded; to be <HI>spiritually</HI> minded, is to be of a virtuous and holy Disposition.</P>
<P>When Christ says, Joh. iii. 6. <HI>That which is born of the</HI> Flesh, <HI>is</HI> Flesh, he represents the <HI>Flesh</HI> not meerly as a Quality; for it would be incongruous, to speak of a Quality as a Thing born: 'tis a Person, or Man, that is born. Therefore Man, as in his whole Nature corrupt, is called <HI>Flesh:</HI> Which is agreable to other Scripture-Repre∣sentations, where the corrupt Nature is called the <HI>Old Man,</HI> the <HI>Body of Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Body of Death.</HI> Agreable to this are those Representations in the 7th and 8th Chapters of <HI>Ro∣mans:</HI> there <HI>Flesh</HI> is figuratively represented as a Person, according to the Apostle's Manner, observed by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> and after him by Dr.<HI>T—r;</HI> who takes Notice, that the Apo∣stle, in the 6th and 7th of <HI>Romans</HI> represents Sin as a Person; and that he figuratively distinguishes in himself two Persons, speaking of Flesh as his Person. <HI>For I
<PB N="202" REF="008118_0222_0F6B580A02411660"/>
know that in ME, that is, in my</HI> Flesh, <HI>dwelleth no good thing.</HI> And it may be observed, that in the 8th Chapter, he still continues this Representation, speaking of the <HI>Flesh</HI> as a Person: and accordingly in the 6th &amp; 7th Verses, speaks of <HI>the Mind of the Flesh,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and of <HI>the Mind of the Spirit,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as if the <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> were two opposite Persons, each having a Mind contrary to the Mind of the other. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> interprets this <HI>Mind of the Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Mind of the Spirit,</HI> as tho' the <HI>Flesh</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> were here spoken of as the different <HI>Objects,</HI> about which the Mind spoken of is conversant. Which is plainly beside the Apostle's Sense; who speaks of the Flesh and Spirit as the Subjects and Agents, in which the Mind spoken of is; and not the Objects, about which it acts. We have the same Phrase again, v. 27. <HI>He that searcheth the Hearts,</HI> knoweth what is the MIND OF THE SPIRIT, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Mind of the spi∣ritual Nature in the Saints being the same with the Mind of the Spirit of God himself, who imparts and actuates that spiritual Nature; Here the Spirit is the Subject and Agent, and not the Object. The same Apostle in like Manner uses the Word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Col. ii. 18. <HI>Vainly puffed up by his</HI> fleshly Mind, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>by the Mind of his Flesh.</HI> And this Agent so often called <HI>Flesh,</HI> represented by the Apostle, as altogether evil, without any good Thing dwelling in it, or belonging to it, yea perfectly contrary to God and his Law, and tending wholly to Death and Ruin, and directly opposite to the Spirit, is what Christ speaks of to <HI>Nicodemus</HI> as born in the first Birth, as giv∣ing a Reason why there is a Necessity of a New-birth, in order to a better Production.</P>
<P>One thing is particularly observable in that Discourse of the Apostle, in the 7th and 8th of <HI>Romans,</HI> in which he so often uses the Term <HI>Flesh,</HI> as opposite to <HI>Spirit,</HI> which as well as many other things in his Discourse, makes it plain, that by <HI>Flesh</HI> he means something in itself corrupt and sinful; and that is, that he expresly calls it <HI>sinful Flesh,</HI> Rom. viii. 3. 'Tis manifest, that by <HI>sinful Flesh</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="008118_0223_0F6B580AC74E6C20"/>
he means the same Thing with that Flesh spoken of in the immediately foregoing and following Words, and in all the Context: And that when it is said, Christ was made in the Likeness of <HI>sinful Flesh,</HI> the Expression is equipol∣lent with those that speak of Christ as <HI>made Sin,</HI> &amp; <HI>made a Curse for us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are opposed one to another in Gal. v. in the same Manner as in the 8th of <HI>Romans:</HI> And there, by <HI>Flesh</HI> cannot be meant only the <HI>human Nature of Body and Soul,</HI> or <HI>the meer Constitution and Powers of a Man,</HI> as in its natural State, innocent and right. In the 16th v. the Apostle says, <Q>Walk in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and ye shall not fulfil the Lusts of the <HI>Flesh:</HI></Q> where the Flesh is spoken of as a Thing of an evil Inclination, De∣sire or Lust. But this is more strongly signified in the next Words; <HI>For the</HI> Flesh <HI>lusteth against the</HI> Spirit, <HI>and the</HI> Spirit <HI>against the</HI> Flesh; <HI>and these are contrary one to another.</HI> What could have been said more plainly, to shew that what the Apostle means by <HI>Flesh,</HI> is something very evil in its Nature, and an irreconcileable Enemy to all Goodness? And it may be observed, that in these Words, and those that follow, the Apostle still figuratively repre∣sents the <HI>Flesh</HI> as a Person or Agent, desiring, acting, having Lusts, and performing Works. And by Works of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and Fruits of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which are opposed to each other, from v. 19. to the End, are plainly meant the same as Works of a sinful Nature, and Fruits of a holy renewed Nature. <HI>Now the Works of the</HI> Flesh <HI>are manifest, which are these; Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Las∣civiousness, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies,</HI> &amp;c.—<HI>But the Fruit of the</HI> Spirit <HI>is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentle∣ness, Goodness,</HI> &amp;c. The Apostle, by <HI>Flesh,</HI> don't mean any thing that is innocent and good in itself, that only needs to be restrained, and kept in proper Bounds; but some∣thing altogether Evil, which is to be destroyed, and not only restrained. 1 Cor. v. 5. <HI>To deliver such an One to Satan, for the</HI> Destruction of the Flesh. We must have
<PB N="204" REF="008118_0224_0F6B580B86588EB8"/>
<HI>no Mercy on it;</HI> we can't be <HI>too cruel to it;</HI> it must even <HI>be crucified.</HI> Gal. v. 24. <HI>They that are Christ's, have</HI> crucified <HI>the</HI> Flesh, <HI>with the Affections and Lusts.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>John,</HI> the same Apostle that writes the Account of what Christ said to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> by the <HI>Spirit</HI> means the same thing as a new, divine and holy Nature, exerting itself in a Principle of divine Love, which is the Sum of all Christian Holiness. 1 Joh. iii. 23, 24. <HI>And that we should love one another, as he gave us Command∣ment; and he that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that be a∣bideth in us, by the</HI> Spirit <HI>that he hath given us.</HI> With Chap. iv. 12, 13. <HI>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his Love is perfected in us: Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, because he hath given us of his</HI> Spirit. The spiritual Principle in us being as it were a Communication of the Spirit of God to us.</P>
<P>And as by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>is meant a holy Nature, so by the Epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>spiritual,</HI> is meant the same as truly virtuous and holy, Gal. vi. 1. <HI>Ye that are</HI> spiritual, <HI>re∣store such an one in the Spirit of Meekness.</HI> The Apostle refers to what he had just said, in the End of the forego∣ing Chapter, where he had mentioned <HI>Meekness,</HI> as a Fruit of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> And so by <HI>carnal,</HI> or <HI>fleshly,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is meant the same as sinful. Rom. vii. 14. <HI>The Law is</HI> spiritual (i. e. holy) <HI>But I am</HI> carnal, <HI>sold under Sin.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis evident, that by <HI>Flesh,</HI> as the Word is used in the New Testament, &amp; opposed to <HI>Spirit,</HI> when speaking of the Qualifications for eternal Salvation, is not meant only what is now vulgarly called <HI>the Sins of the Flesh,</HI> con∣sisting in inordinate Appetites of the Body, and their In∣dulge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; but the whole Body of Sin, implying those Lusts that are most subtil, and furthest from any Rela∣tion to the Body; such as Pride, Malice, Envy, &amp;c. When the <HI>Works of the Flesh</HI> are enumerated, Gal. v. 19, 20, 21. they are Vices of the latter Kind chiefly, that are mentioned; <HI>Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, E∣mulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envyings.</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="008118_0225_0F6B580CA19DAEB0"/>
So, Pride of Heart is the Effect or Operation of the <HI>Flesh.</HI> Col. ii. 18. <HI>Vainly puffed up by his</HI> fleshly Mind: in the <HI>Greek, by the Mind of the Flesh.</HI> So <HI>Pride, En∣vying, Strife</HI> and <HI>Division,</HI> are spoken of as Works of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 3,4. <HI>For ye are yet</HI> carnal (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>fleshly.</HI>) <HI>For whereas there is Envying, and Strife, and Division, are ye not</HI> carnal, <HI>and walk as Men? For while one saith, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>and another, I am of</HI> Apollos, <HI>are ye not carnal?</HI> Such kind of Lusts don't depend on the Body, or external Senses; for the Devil himself has them in the highest Degree, who has not, nor ever had, any Body or external Senses to gratify.</P>
<P>Here, if it should be enquir'd, how Corruption or De∣pravity in general, or the Nature of Man as corrupt and sinful, came to be called <HI>Flesh;</HI> and not only that Corrup∣tion which consists in inordinate bodily Appetites? I think, what the Apostle says in the last cited Place, <HI>Are ye not carnal, and walk AS MEN?</HI> leads us to the true Rea∣son. 'Tis because a corrupt and sinful Nature is what properly belongs to <HI>Mankind,</HI> or the Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> as they are in themselves, and as they are <HI>by Nature.</HI> The Word <HI>Flesh</HI> is a Word often used in both old Testament and new to signify <HI>Mankind</HI> in their present State. To enumerate all the Places, would be very tedious; I shall therefore only mention a few Places in the New Testament. Matt. xxiv. 22. <HI>Except those Days should be shortned, no</HI> Flesh <HI>should be saved.</HI> Luk. iii. 6. <HI>All</HI> Flesh <HI>shall see the Salvation of God.</HI> Joh. xvii. 2. <HI>Thou hast given him Power over all</HI> Flesh. See also Act. ii. 17. Rom. iii.20. 1 Cor. i. 29. Gal. ii. 16. Man's Nature, being left to it self, forsaken of the Spirit of God, as it was when Man fell, and consequently forsaken of divine and holy Principles, of it self became exceeding corrupt, utterly depraved and ruined. And so the Word <HI>Flesh,</HI> which signifies <HI>Man,</HI> came to be used to signify Man as he is in himself, in his natural State debased, corrupt and ruin'd. And on the other Hand, the Word <HI>Spirit</HI> came to be used to signify a divine and holy Principle, or new Nature; because that
<PB N="206" REF="008118_0226_0F6B580D789FD980"/>
is not <HI>of Man,</HI> but <HI>of God,</HI> by the Indwelling and vital Influence of his <HI>Spirit.</HI> And thus to be <HI>corrupt,</HI> and to be <HI>carnal,</HI> or <HI>fleshly,</HI> and to <HI>walk as Men,</HI> are the same thing with the Apostle. And so in other Parts of the Scripture, to <HI>savour the Things that be of Men,</HI> and to <HI>savour Things which are corrupt,</HI> are the same; and <HI>Sons of Men,</HI> and <HI>wicked Men,</HI> also are the same, as was observ∣ed before. And on the other hand, to <HI>savour the Things that be of God,</HI> and to <HI>receive the Things of the Spirit of God,</HI> are Phrases that signify as much as relishing and embracing true Holiness or divine Virtue.</P>
<P>All these Things confirm what we have supposed to be Christ's Meaning, in saying, <HI>That which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</HI> His Speech implies, that what is born in the first Birth of Man, is Nothing but Man as he is of himself, without any thing divine in him; depraved, debased, sinful, ruin'd Man, utterly unfit to enter into the Kingdom of God, and incapable of the spiritual divine Happiness of that Kingdom: but that which is born in the new Birth, of the Spirit of God, is a spiritual Principle, and holy and divine Nature, meet for the divine &amp; heavenly Kingdom. 'Tis a Confirmation that this is the true Meaning, that it is not only evidently agreable to the constant Language of the Spirit of Christ in the New-Testament; but the Words understood in this Sense, contain the proper and true Rea∣son, why a Man must be born again, in order to enter into the Kingdom of God; the Reason that is given every where in other Parts of the Scripture for the Necessity of a Renovation, a Change of Mind, a new Heart &amp;c. in or∣der to Salvation: To give a Reason of which to <HI>Nicode∣mus,</HI> is plainly Christ's Design in the Words which have been insisted on.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, I would observe one Thing as a Co∣rollary from what has been said.</P>
<P><HI>Corol.</HI> If by Flesh and Spirit when spoken of in the New Testament, and opposed to each other, in Discourses on the necessary Qualifications for Salvation, we are to
<PB N="207" REF="008118_0227_0F6B580DC1C33BA0"/>
understand what has been now supposed, it will not only follow, that Men by Nature are corrupt, but <HI>wholly cor∣rupt,</HI> without any good Thing. If by Flesh is meant Man's Nature, as he receives it in his first Birth, then <HI>therein dwelleth no good Thing;</HI> as appears by Rom. vii. 18. 'Tis wholly opposite to God, and to Subjection to his Law, as appears by Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iii. 7, 8. 'Tis directly contrary to true Holiness, and wholly opposes it, and Holiness is opposite to that; as appears by Gal. v. 17. So long as Men are in their natural State, they not only have no good Thing, but it is impossible they should have, or do any good Thing; as appears by Rom. viii. 8. There is nothing in their Nature, as they have it by the first Birth, whence should arise any true Subjection to Old; as appears by Rom. viii. 7. If there were any thing truly good in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> or in <HI>Man's Nature,</HI> or natural Dispo∣sition, under a moral View, then it should only be amended; but the Scripture represents as tho' we were to be Ene∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to it, and were to seek nothing short of its entire De∣struction, as has been observed. And elsewhere the Apo∣stle directs not to the amending of the <HI>old Man,</HI> but <HI>put∣ting it off,</HI> and putting on the <HI>new Man;</HI> and seeks not to have the <HI>Body of Death</HI> made better, but to be <HI>deliver'd</HI> from it; And says, <HI>That if any Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature</HI> (which doubtless means the same as a Man <HI>new-born</HI>) <HI>Old Things are</HI> (not amended) <HI>but passed away, and ALL Things are become new.</HI></P>
<P>But this will be further evident, if we particularly con∣sider the Apostle's Discourse in the latter Part of the se∣cond Chapter of 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> &amp; the Beginning of the third. There the Apostle speaks of the <HI>natural Man,</HI> and the <HI>spiritual Man:</HI> where <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> are oppos'd just in the same Manner, as I have observed <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> often are. In Chap. ii. 14,15. he says, <HI>The na∣tural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual, judgeth all Things.</HI> And not only
<PB N="208" REF="008118_0228_0F6B580E97541778"/>
does the Apostle here oppose <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>spiritual,</HI> just as he elsewhere does <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>spiritual,</HI> but his following Discourse evidently shows, that he means the very same Distinction, the same two distinct and opposite Things. For immediately on his thus speaking of the Difference between the <HI>natural</HI> and the <HI>spiritual</HI> Man, he turns to the <HI>Co∣rinthians,</HI> in the first Words of the next Chapter, connect∣ed with this, and says, <HI>And</HI> I, <HI>Brethren, could not speak unto you as unto</HI> spiritual, <HI>but as unto</HI> carnal. Referring manifestly to what he had been saying, in the immediately proceeding Discourse, about <HI>spiritual</HI> and natural <HI>Men,</HI> and evidently using the Word, <HI>carnal,</HI> as synonymous with <HI>na∣tural.</HI> By which it is put out of all reasonable Dispute, that the Apostle by <HI>natural Men</HI> means the same as Men in that <HI>carnal,</HI> sinful State, that they are in by their first Birth;—notwithstanding all the Glosses and Criticisms, by which modern Writers have endeavoured to palm upon us another Sense of this Phrase, and so to deprive us of the clear Instruction the Apostle gives in that 14th ver. con∣cerning the sinful miserable State of Man by Nature. Dr.<HI>T.</HI> says, by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is meant the <HI>animal Man,</HI> the Man who maketh Sense and Appetite the Law of his Action. If he aims to limit the Meaning of the Word to external Sense, and bodily Appetite, his Meaning is certainly not the Apostle's. For the Apostle in his Sense includes the more spiritual Vices of Envy, Strife, &amp;c. as appears by the four first Verses of the next Chapter; where, as I have observ∣ed, he substitutes the Word <HI>carnal</HI> in the Place of cc. So the Apostle <HI>Jude</HI> uses the Word in like Manner, oppo∣sing it to <HI>spiritual,</HI> or <HI>having the Spirit,</HI> ver. 19. <HI>These are they that separate themselves, sensual</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) "not having the Spirit." The Vices he had been just speak∣ing of, were chiefly of the more spiritual Kind. v. 16. <HI>These are Murmurers, Complainers, walking after their own Lusts; and their Mouth speaketh great swelling Words, having Men's Persons in Admiration because of Advantage.</HI> The Vices mentioned are much of the same Kind with those of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> for which he
<PB N="209" REF="008118_0229_0F6B580F4078F8C0"/>
calls them <HI>carnal; Envying, Strife</HI> and <HI>Divisions,</HI> and saying, <HI>I am of Paul,</HI> and <HI>I of Apollos;</HI> and being <HI>puffed up for one against another.</HI> We have the same Word again, Jam. iii. 14, 15. <HI>If y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have bitter Envying and Strife, glory not, and lie not against the Truth: This Wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,</HI> sensual (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and <HI>devilish;</HI> where also the Vices the Apostle speaks of are of the more spiritual Kind.</P>
<P>So that on the whole, there is sufficient Reason to un∣derstand the Apostle, when he speaks of the <HI>natural Man</HI> in that 1 Cor. ii. 14. as meaning Man in his native corrupt State. And his Words represent him as totally corrupt, wholly a Stranger and Enemy to true Virtue or Holiness, and Things appertaining to it, which it appears are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣monly intended in the New Testament by Things <HI>spiri∣tual,</HI> and are doubtless here meant by <HI>Things of the Spirit of God.</HI> These Words also represent, that it is impossible Man should be otherwise, while in his natural State. The Expressions are very strong: <HI>The natural Man re∣ceiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God,</HI> is not sus∣ceptible of Things of that Kind, <HI>neither can be know them,</HI> can have no true Sense or Relish of them, or Notion of their real Nature and true Excellency; <HI>Because they are spiritually discerned;</HI> they are not discerned by Means of any Principle in Nature, but altogether by a Principle that is divine, something introduced by the Grace of God's holy Spirit, which is above all that is natural. The Words are in a considerable Degree parallel with those of our Saviour, Joh. xiv. 16,17. <HI>He shall give you the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nei∣their knoweth him: But ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</HI></P>

<P>IF the Scriptures represent all Mankind as wicked in their first State, before they are made Partakers of the
<PB N="210" REF="008118_0230_0F6B581209FE2E88"/>
Benefits of Christ's Redemption, then they are wicked by Nature: For doubtless Men's first State is their native State, or the State they come into the World in. But the Scriptures do thus represent all Mankind.</P>
<P>Before I mention particular Texts to this Purpose, I would observe, that it alters not the Case as to the Argu∣ment in Hand, whether we suppose these Texts speak di∣rectly of Infants, or only of such as are capable of some Understanding, so as to understand something of their own Duty and State. For if it be so with all Mankind, that as soon as ever they are capable of reflecting and knowing their own moral State, they find themselves wicked, this proves that they are wicked by Nature; either born wicked, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn with an infallible Disposition to be wicked as soon as possible, if there be any Difference between these; and either of 'em will prove Men to be born exceedingly de∣praved. I have before proved, that a native Propensity to Sin certainly follows from many things said in the Scrip∣ture, of Mankind; but what I intend now, is something more direct, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prove by direct Scripture-Testimony, that all Mankind in their first State are really of a wicked Character.</P>
<P>To this Purpose is exceeding full, express &amp; abundant that Passage of the Apostle, in <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. beginning with the 9th v. to the End of the 24th; which I shall set down at large, distinguishing the universal Terms which are here so often repeated, by a distinct Character. The Apostle having in the first Chap. v. 16, 17. laid down his Propo∣sition, that none can be saved in any other Way than thro' the Righteousness of God, by Faith in Jesus Christ, he proceeds to prove this Point, by shewing particularly that all are in themselves Wicked, and without any Righteous∣ness of their own. First, he insists on the Wickedness of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in the first Chapter; and next, on the Wick∣edness of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the second Chapter. And then in this Place, he comes to sum up the Matter, and draw the Conclusion in the Words following: <Q>What then, are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have before
<PB N="211" REF="008118_0231_0F6B5812B6391698"/>
proved both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they are all under Sin: As it is written, There is NONE righteous, NO, NOT ONE; there is NONE that understandeth; there is NONE that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeketh after God; they are ALL gone out of the Way; they are TOGETHER become unprofitable; there is NONE that doth Good, NO, NOT ONE. Their Throat is an open, Sepulchre; with their Tongues they have used Deceit; the Poison of Asps is under their Lips; whose Mouth is full of Cursing &amp; Bitterness; their Feet are swift to shed Blood; Destruction and Misery are in their Ways, and the Way of Peace they have not known; there is no Fear of God before their Eyes. Now we know, that whatsoever Things the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law, that EVERY Mouth may be stopped, and ALL THE WORLD may become guilty before God. Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there shall NO FLESH be justified in his Sight; for by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin. But now the Righteousness of God without the Law, is manifest, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; even the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto ALL, and upon ALL them that believe; for there is NO DIFFE∣RENCE. For ALL have sinned,&amp; come short of the Glory of God. Being justified freely by his Grace, thro' the Redemption which is in Jesus Christ.</Q>—</P>
<P>Here the thing which I would prove, <HI>viz.</HI> that Mankind in their first State, before they are interested in the Bene∣fits of Christ's Redemption, are universally wicked, is de∣clared with the utmost possible Fulness and Precision. So that if here this Matter ben't set forth plainly, expresly and fully, it must be because no Words can do it, and it is not in the Power of Language or any Manner of Terms and Phrases, however contrived and heaped up one upon another, determinately to signify any such Thing.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> to take off the Force of the whole, would have us to understand (P. 104—107) that these Passages, quoted from the Psalms, and other Parts of the old Testament,
<PB N="212" REF="008118_0232_0F6B58130315C798"/>
don't speak of <HI>all Mankind,</HI> nor of <HI>all the Jews; but only of them of whom they were true.</HI> He observes, there were many that were innocent and righteous; tho' there were also many, a strong Party, that were wicked, corrupt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of whom these Texts were to be understood. Concerning which I would observe the following Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. According to this, the Universality of the Terms that are found in these Places, which the Apostle cites from the old Testament, to prove that <HI>all the World, both Jews and Gentiles, are under Sin,</HI> is nothing to his Purpose. The Apostle uses universal Terms in his Proposition, and in his Conclusion, that ALL are under Sin, that EVERY MOUTH is stopped, ALL THE WORLD guilty,—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Deeds of the Law NO FLESH can be justified. And he chuses out a Number of universal Say∣ings or Clauses out of the Old Testament, to confirm this Universality; as, <HI>There is none righteous; no, not one: They are all gone out of the Way; There is none that understandeth,</HI> &amp;c. But yet the Universality of these Expressions is nothing to his Purpose; because the universal Terms found in 'em have indeed no Reference to any such Universality, as this the Apostle speaks of, nor any thing a-kin to it; they mean no Universality, either in the collective Sense, or personal Sense; no Universality of the Nations of the World, or of particular Persons in those Nations, or in any one Nation in the World: <Q><HI>But only of those of whom they are true.</HI></Q> That is, <HI>There is none of them righteous,</HI> of whom it is <HI>true,</HI> that they are not <HI>righteous; no, not one: There is none that understand,</HI> of whom it is <HI>true,</HI> that <HI>they</HI> understand not: <HI>They are all gone out of the Way,</HI> of whom it is <HI>true,</HI> that they are gone out of the Way, &amp;c.—Or these Expressions are to be understood concerning that strong Party in <HI>Israel,</HI> in <HI>David's</HI> and <HI>Solomon's</HI> Days and in the Prophets Days: they are to be understood of them universally. And what is that to the Apostle's Purpose? How does such an Universality of Wickedness, as this,—that all were wicked in <HI>Israel,</HI> who were wicked,—or, that there was a particular evil Party, all
<PB N="213" REF="008118_0233_0F6B5813CC609058"/>
of which were wicked,—confirm that Universality which the Apostle would prove, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>all Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> and the <HI>whole World</HI> were wicked, and <HI>every Mouth stopped,</HI> and that <HI>no Flesh</HI> could be justified by their own Righteousness.</P>
<P>Here nothing can be said to abate the Nonsense, but this, That the Apostle would convince the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they were capable of being wicked, as well as other Na∣tions; and to prove it, he mentions some Texts, which shew that there was a wicked Party in <HI>Israel,</HI> a Thousand Years ago: And that as to the universal Terms which hap∣pened to be in these Texts, the Apostle had no Respect to these; but his reciting them is as it were accidental, they happened to be in some Texts which speak of an evil Party in <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Apostle cites 'em as they are, not be∣cause they are any more to his Purpose for the universal Terms, which happen to be in them. But let the Reader look on the Words of the Apostle, and observe the Vio∣lence of such a Supposition. Particularly let the Words of the 9th and 10th Verses, and their Connection, be ob∣served. <HI>All are under Sin: as it is written, There is none righteous; no, not one.</HI> How plain is it, that the Apostle cites that latter universal Clause out of the 14th Psalm, to confirm the proceeding universal Words of his own Proposition? And yet it will follow from the Things which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes, that the Universality of the Terms in the last Words, <HI>There is none righteous; no, not one,</HI> have no Relation at all to that Universality he speaks of in the preceeding Clause, to which they are join'd, <HI>All are under Sin:</HI> and is no more a Confirmation of it, than if the Words were thus, 'There are <HI>some,</HI> or there are <HI>many</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> that are not righteous.'</P>
<P N="2">2. To suppose, the Apostle's Design in citing these Passa∣ges, was only to prove to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that of old there was a considerable Number of their Nation that were wicked Men, is to suppose him to have gone about to prove what none of the <HI>Jews</HI> denied, or made the least Doubt of. Even the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> the most self-righteous
<PB N="214" REF="008118_0234_0F6B5814E55A87D0"/>
Sect of them, who went furthest in glorying in the Dis∣tinction of their Nation from other Nations, as a holy Peo∣ple, knew it, and own'd it: they openly confessed that their <HI>Forefathers killed the Prophets,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 29, 30, 31. And if the Apostle's Design had been only to refresh their Memories to put 'em in Mind of the antient Wickedness of their Nation, to lead to Reflection on them∣selves as guilty of the like Wickedness (as <HI>Stephen</HI> does, Acts vii.) what Need had the Apostle to go so far about to prove this; gathering up many Sentences here and there, which prove that their Scriptures did speak of some as wicked Men; and then, in the next Place, to prove that the wicked Men spoken of must be of the Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> by this Argument, That <HI>what things so ever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law,</HI> or that whatsoever the Books of the Old Testament said, it must be understood of that People that had the Old Testa∣ment? What Need had the Apostle of such an Ambages or Fetch as this, to prove to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that there had been many of their Nation in some of the antient Ages, which were wicked Men; when the Old Testament was full of Passages that asserted this expresly, not only of a strong Party, but of the Nation in general? How much more would it have been to such a Purpose, to have put 'em in Mind of the Wickedness of the People in general, in worshipping the golden Calf, &amp; the Unbelief, Mumur∣ing and Perverseness of the whole Congregation in the Wilderness, for forty Years as <HI>Stephen</HI> does? Which Things he had no need to prove to be spoken of their Nation, by any such indirect Argument, as that, <HI>Whatsoever Things the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It would have been impertinent to the Apostle's Purpose, even as our Author understands his Purpose, for him to have gone about to convince the <HI>Jews,</HI> that there had been a strong Party of bad Men in <HI>David's,</HI> &amp; <HI>Solo∣mon's,</HI> and the Prophets Times. For Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes, the Apostle's Aim is to prove the great Corruption of both
<PB N="215" REF="008118_0235_0F6B581545068B78"/>
<HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> at that Day, when Christ came into the World.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Key</HI> § 275, 278.</NOTE></P>
<P>In order the more fully to evade the clear &amp; abundant Testimonies to the Doctrine of original Sin, contained in this Part of the holy Scripture, our Author says, The Apo∣stle is here speaking of Bodies of People, of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> in a collective Sense, as two great Bodies into which Mankind are divided; speaking of them in their collective Capacity, and not with respect to particular Per∣sons; that the Apostle's Design is to prove, neither of these two great collective Bodies, in their collective Sense, can be justified by Law, because both were corrupt; and so, that no more is implied, than that the Generality of both were Wicked. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 102, 104, 117, 119, 120. and Note on Rom. iii. 10—19.</NOTE> On this I observe,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That this supposed Sense disagrees extremely with the Terms and Language which the Apostle here makes use of. For according to this, we must understand, either</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> that the Apostle means no Universality at all, but only the far greater Part. But if the Words which the Apostle uses, don't most fully and determinately signify an Universality, no Words ever used in the Bible are suffi∣cient to do it. I might challenge any Man to produce any one Paragraph in the Scripture, from the Beginning to the End, where there is such a Repetition and Accu∣mulation of Terms, so strongly and emphatically and care∣fully to express the most perfect &amp; absolute Universality; or any Place to be compared to it. What Instance is there in the Scripture, or indeed any other Writing, when the Meaning is only the much greater Part, where this Meaning is signified in such a Manner, by repeating such Expressi∣ons, <HI>They are all,—They are all,—They are all,—,toge∣ther—every one,—all the World;</HI> join'd to multiplied negative Terms, to shew the Universality to be without Exception; saying, <HI>There is no Flesh,—there is none—there is none—there is none—there is none,</HI> four times <HI>over;</HI> besides the Addition of, <HI>No, not one,—no, not one,</HI>—once and again!</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="008118_0236_0F6B58161BCE6C68"/>Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> if any Universality at all be allowed, it is only of the collective Bodies spoken of; and these collect∣ive Bodies but two, as Dr.<HI>T.</HI> reckons them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, and the <HI>Gentile</HI> World; supposing the Apostle is here representing each of these Parts of Mankind as being Wicked. But is this the Way of Men's using Language, when speaking of but two Things, to express themselves in universal Terms, of such a Sort, and in such a Manner, and when they mean no more than that the Thing affirm'd is predicated of both of them? If a Man speaking of his two Feet as both lame, should say, <HI>All my Feet are lame, They are all lame. All together are become weak, None of my Feet are strong, None of them are sound; No, not one;</HI> would not he be thought to be lame in his Under∣standing, as well as his Feet? When the Apostle says, <HI>That every Mouth may be stopped,</HI> must we suppose, that he speaks only of those two great collective Bodies, figura∣tively ascribing to each of them a Mouth, and mean that those two Mouths are stopped!</P>
<P>And besides, according to our Author's own Interpreta∣tion, the universal Terms used in these Texts cited from the old Testament, have no respect to those two great col∣lective Bodies, nor indeed to either of them; but to <HI>some</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> a particular dissaffected Party in that one Nation, which was made up of wicked Men. So that his Interpre∣tation is every way absurd and inconsistent.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) If the Apostle is speaking only of the Wickedness or Guilt of great collective Bodies, then it will follow, that also the Justification he here treats of, is no other than the Justification of such collective Bodies. For, they are the same he speaks of as guilty and wicked, that he argues cannot be <HI>justified</HI> by the Works of the Law, by Reason of their being <HI>Wicked.</HI> Otherwise his Argument is whol∣ly disannul'd. If the Guilt he speaks of be only of col∣lective Bodies, then what he argues from that Guilt, must be only, that collective Bodies cannot be justified by the Works of the Law, having no Respect to the Justification of particular Persons. And indeed this is Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s de∣clared
<PB N="217" REF="008118_0237_0F6B5816CB180EB0"/>
Opinion. He supposes, the Apostle here, and in o∣ther Parts of this Epistle, is speaking of Men's Justification <HI>considered only as in their collective Capacity.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Note</HI> on Rom. iii. 10,—19. and on Chap. v. 11. and on Chap. ix. 30, 31. and on Chap. xi. 31.</NOTE> But the contrary is most manifest. The 16th and 18th Verses of this third Chapter can't, without the utmost Violence, be un∣derstood otherwise than of the Justification of particular Persons. <HI>That he might be just, and the Justifier of HIM that believeth in Jesus.—Therefore we conclude that A MAN is justified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> So Chap. iv. 5. <HI>But to HIM that work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th not, but b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veth on him that justifieth the ungodly. HIS Faith is counted for Righteousness.</HI> And what the Apostle cites in the 6, 7, &amp; 8th Verses from the Book of Psalms, evidently shews, that he is speaking of the Justification of particular Persons. <HI>Even as</HI> David <HI>also describ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Blessedness of THE MAN unto whom God imputeth Righteousness without Works, saying, Blessed are they whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose Sins are covered. David</HI> says these Things in the 32d Psalm, with a special respect to his own particular Case; there expressing the great Distress he was in, while under a Sense of the Guilt of his personal Sin, and the great Joy he had when God forgave him; as in v. 3.4.</P>
<P>And then, it is very plain in that Paragraph of the third Chapter, which we have been upon. that it is the Justifi∣cation of particular Persons that the Apostle speaks of, by that Place in the Old Testament, which he refers to in v. 20. <HI>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there shall no Flesh he justified in his Sight.</HI> He refers to that in Psal. exliii. <HI>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant; for in thy Sight shall NO MAN LIVING be justified.</HI> Here the Psalmist is not speaking of the Justification of a Nation, as a collective Body, or of one of the two Parts of the World, but of a particular Man. And 'tis further mani∣fest, that the Apostle is here speaking of personal Justifi∣cation, in-as-much as this Place is evidently parallel with that, Gal. iii. 10,11. <HI>For as many as are of the Works of
<PB N="217" REF="008118_0238_0F6B5817819DA688"/>
<PB N="218" REF="008118_0239_0F6B5818434F59E0"/>
the Law, are under the Curse: for it is written, Cursed is EVERY ONE that contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth not in all things that are written in the Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Law to do them. But that NO MAN is justified by the Works of the Law, is evi∣dent; for the just shall live by Faith.</HI> It is plain, that this Place is parallel with that in the 3d of <HI>Romans,</HI> not only as the Thing asserted is the same, and the Argument by which it is proved here, is the same as there, <HI>viz.</HI> that all are guilty, and exposed to be condemned by the Law; But the same Saying of the Old Testament is cited here in the Beginning of this Discourse in <HI>Galatians.</HI> (Chap. i. 16.) And many other Things demonstrate, that the A∣postle is speaking of the same Justification in both Places, which I omit for Brevity's sake.</P>
<P>And besides all these Things, our Author's Interpre∣tation makes the Apostle's Argument wholly void a∣nother Way. The Apostle is speaking of a certain Sub∣ject, which cannot be justified by the Works of the Law; and his Argument is that, that same Subject is guilty, and is condemned by the Law, If he means, that one Subject, suppose a collective Body or Bodies, can't be justified by the Law, because another Subject, another collective Body, is condemned by the Law, 'tis plain, the Argument would be quite vain and impertinent. Yet thus the Argument must stand according to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Interpretation. The collective Bodies, which he supposes are spoken of as wick∣ed, and condemned by the Law, considered as in their collective Capacity, are those two, the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, and the heathen World: But the collective Body which he supposes the Apostle speaks of as justified without the Deeds of the Law, is neither of these, but the Christian Church, or Body of Believers; which is a new collective Body, a new Creature, and a new Man, (according to our Author's understanding of such Phrases) which never had any Existence before it was justified, and therefore never was wicked or condemned, unless it was with regard to the Individuals, of which it was con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ted: and it does not appear, according to our Author's Scheme, that these In∣dividuals
<PB N="220" REF="008118_0240_0F6B58190FCBA7C8"/>
over corrupt, in every Part. And not only is the total Corruption thus intimated, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>numerating the several Parts, but by denying of all Good; any true Understanding or spiritual Knowledge, any virtuous Action, or so much as truly virtuous Desire, or seeking after God. <HI>There is none that</HI> understandeth; <HI>There is none that</HI> seeketh <HI>after God: There is none that</HI> doth Good; <HI>The Way of Peace have they</HI> not known. And in general, by denying all true Piety or Religion in Men, in their first State, v. 18. <HI>There is</HI> no Fear <HI>of God before their Eyes.</HI>—The Expressions also are evidently chosen to denote a most extreme &amp; des∣perate Wickedness of Heart. An exceeding Depravity is ascribed to every Part: to the Throat, the Scent of an <HI>open S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pulchre;</HI> to the Tongue and Lips, <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it</HI> and <HI>the Poi∣son of Asps;</HI> to the Mouth, <HI>Cursing</HI> and <HI>Bitterness;</HI> of their F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t it is said, they are <HI>swift to shed Blood:</HI> And with regard to the whole Man, 'tis said, <HI>Destruction</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> are in their Ways. The Representation is very strong, of each of these Things, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>all</HI> Mankind are corrupt; that every one is <HI>wholly,</HI> and altogether cor∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt; and also <HI>extremely</HI> and desperately corrupt. And it is plain, 'tis not accidental, that we have here such a Collection of such strong Expressions, so emphatically signifying these Things; but that they are chosen of the Apostle on Design, as being directly and fully to his Pur∣pose; which Purpose appears in all his Discourse in the whole of this Chapter, and indeed from the Beginning of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Epistle.</P>

Chap. v. 6,—10. <HI>For when we were yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Strength, <HI>in due Time Christ died for the</HI> Ungodly. <HI>For scarcely for a righteous Man will one die; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a good Man, some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his Love towards us, in that while we were yet</HI> Sinners, <HI>Christ died for us.

<P>Here all that Christ died for, and that are saved by him, are spoken of as being in their first State <HI>Sinners, Ungod∣ly, Enemies</HI> to God, exposed to divine <HI>Wrath,</HI> and <HI>with∣out Strength,</HI> without Ability to help themselves, or deliver their Souls from this miserable State.</P>
<P>D.<HI>T.</HI> says, The Apostle here speaks of the <HI>Gentiles only in their heathen State,</HI> in Contradistinction to the <HI>Jews;</HI> and that not of particular Persons among the heathen G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tiles, or as to the State they were in personally; but only of the Gentiles <HI>collectively taken,</HI> or of the miserable State of that great collective Body, the heathen World: And that these Appellations; <HI>Sinners, Ungodly, Enemies,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were Names by which the Apostles in their Writings were worst to signify and distinguish the heathen World, in Op∣position to the <HI>Jews;</HI> and that in this Sense these Appel∣lations are to be taken in their Epistles, and in this Place in particular.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 114,—120.

<P>But it is very remarkable, that a Christian Divine, who has studied the new Testament, and the Epistle to the <HI>Romans</HI> in particular, so diligently as Dr. <HI>T.</HI>—should be strong in an Imagination, that the Apostles of Jesus Christ should so far countenance, and do so much to cherish these self-exalting, uncharitable Dispositions and Notions of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which gave Rise to such a Custom, as to fall in with that Custom, and adopt that Language of their Pride and Contempt; and especially that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> should do it.

Jews <HI>holy, Children of</HI> Abraham, <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Children of God,</HI> but the Gentiles <HI>Sinners, Unclean, Enemies,</HI> and the like. He makes it almost his whole Business, from the Beginning of the Epistle, to this Passage in the 5th Chapter which we are upon, to convince them that there was no Ground for any such Distinction, and to prove that in common, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> all were desperately wicked, and none righteous, no, not one. He tells them, Chap. iii. 9. that the <HI>Jews</HI> were by no Means better than the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and (in what follows in that Chapter) that there was no Difference between <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and represents all us without Strength, or any Sufficiency of their own in the Affair of Justification &amp; Redemption: And in the Continuation of the same Discourse, in the 4th Chapter, teaches that all that were justified by Christ, were in themselves <HI>ungodly;</HI> and that being the Children of <HI>Abraham</HI> was not peculiar to the <HI>Jews.</HI> In this 5th Chap. still in Continuation of the same Discourse, on the same Subject and Argument of Justification thro' Christ, and by Faith in him, he speaks of Christ's dying for the <HI>Ungodly</HI> and <HI>Sinners,</HI> and those that were without <HI>Strength</HI> or Sufficiency for their own Salvation, as he had done all along before. But now, it seems, the Apostle by <HI>Sinners</HI> and <HI>ungodly</HI> must not be understood according as he used these Words before; but must be supposed to mean only the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as distinguished from the <HI>Jews;</HI> adopting the Language of those self-righteous; self-exalting, disdainful <HI>Judaizing</HI> Teachers, whom he was with all his Might op∣posing: Countenancing the very same thing in them, which he had been from the Beginning of the Epistle discounte∣nancing, and endeavouring to discourage, and utterly to abolish, with all his Art and Strength.</P>
<P>One Reason, why the <HI>Jews</HI> looked on themselves better than the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and called themselves <HI>holy</HI> and the Gen∣tiles <HI>Sinners,</HI> was, that they had the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Moses.</HI> They <HI>made their Boast of the Law.</HI> But the Apostle shews them, that this was so far from making them better, that it condemned them, and was an Occasion of their being
<PB N="226" REF="008118_0246_0F6B58209279CC20"/>
<HI>Sinners</HI> in a higher Degree, and more aggravated Manner, and more e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ectually and dreadfully <HI>dead</HI> in and by Sin, Chap vii. 4,—13. agreable to those Words of Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> v. 45.</P>
<P>It can't be justly objected here, that this Apostle did in∣deed use this Language, and call the <HI>Gentiles</HI> Sinners, in Contradistinction to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in what he said to <HI>Peter,</HI> which he himself gives an Account of in Gal. ii. 15,16. <HI>We who are</HI> Jews <HI>by Nature, and not</HI> Sinners <HI>of the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>knowing that a Man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by Faith in Jesus Christ.</HI> 'Tis true, that the Apostle here refers to this Distinction, as what was usually made by the self-righteous <HI>Jews,</HI> between themselves and the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> but not in such a Manner as to adopt, or favour it; but on the contrary, so at plainly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew his Disapprobation of it; <HI>q.d.</HI> 'Thô we were born <HI>Jews,</HI> and by Nature are of that People which are wont to make their Boast of the Law, expecting to be justified by it, and trust in themselves that they are righteous, despising others, calling the Gentiles <HI>Sinners,</HI> in Distinction from themselves; yet we being now instructed in the Gospel of Christ, know better; we now know, that a Man is not justified by the Works of the Law; that we are all justified only by Faith in Christ, in whom there is no Difference, no Distinction of <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Gentile,</HI> and <HI>Jew,</HI> but all are one in Christ Jesus.' And this is the very thing, he there speaks of, which he blamed <HI>Peter</HI> for; that by his withdrawing and separa∣ting himself from the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> refusing to eat with them &amp;c. he had countenanced this self-exalting, self-distin∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hing, separating Spirit and Custom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> where∣by they treated the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as in a distinguishing manner <HI>Sinners</HI> and <HI>Unclean,</HI> and not fit to come near them who were a holy People.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Words themselves of the Apostle in this Place, shew plainly, that he here uses the Word, <HI>Sinners,</HI> not as signifying <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Jews,</HI> but as denoting the <HI>morally evil,</HI> in Opposition to such as are <HI>righteous</HI> or <HI>good:</HI> because this latter Opposition or Distinction be∣tween
<PB N="227" REF="008118_0247_0F6B582148B56690"/>
<HI>Sinners</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> is here express'd in plain Terms. <Q>Scarcely for a <HI>righteous Man</HI> will one die; yet peradventure for a <HI>good Man</HI> some would even dare to die: But God commended his Love towards us, in that while we were yet <HI>Sinners,</HI> Christ died for us.</Q> By <HI>righteous Men</HI> are doubtless meant the same that are meant by such a Phrase, throughout this Apostle's Writings, and throughout the New-Testament, and throughout the Bible. Will any one pretend, that by the righteous Man, whom Men would scarcely die for, and by the good Man, that perhaps some might even dare to die for, is meant a <HI>Jew?</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself don't explain it so, in his Exposi∣tion of this Epistle; and therefore is not very consistent with himself, in supposing, that in the other Part of the Distinction the Apostle means <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as distinguished from the <HI>Jews.</HI> The Apostle himself had been labouring abundantly, in the preceeding Part of the Epistle, to prove that the <HI>Jews</HI> were <HI>Sinners</HI> in this Sense, namely in Op∣position to <HI>righteous;</HI> That all <HI>had sinned,</HI> that all were <HI>under Sin,</HI> and therefore could not be justified, could not be accepted as <HI>righteous,</HI> by their own Righteousness.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another thing which makes it evident, that the Apostle when he speaks in this Place of the <HI>Sinners</HI> and <HI>Enemies</HI> which Christ died for, don't mean only the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> is, that he includes himself among them, saying, <HI>while WE were Sinners,</HI> and <HI>when WE were Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author from Time to Time says, The Apostle, tho' he speaks only of the Gentiles in their Heathen State, yet <HI>puts himself with them, because he was the Apostle of the Gentiles.</HI> But this is very violent and unreasonable. There is no more Sense in it, than there would be in a Father's ranking himself among his Children, when speak∣ing to his Children of the Benefits they have by being be∣gotten by himself; and saying, <HI>We Children</HI>—: Or in a Physician's ranking Himself with his Patients, when talking to them of their Diseases and Cure; saying, <HI>We sick Folks.—Paul'</HI>s being the Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to save 'em from their Heathenism, is so far from being a
<PB N="228" REF="008118_0248_0F6B582201AFD6C8"/>
Reason for him to reckon himself among the Heathen, that on the contrary, 'tis the very thing that would render it in a peculiar Manner unnatural and absurd for him so to do. Because, as the Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he appears as their Healer and Deliverer from Heathenism; and therefore in that Capacity does in a peculiar Manner ap∣pear in his Distinction from the Heathen, and in Opposi∣tion to the State of Heathenism. For 'tis by the most opposite Qualities only, that he is fitted to be an Apostle of the Heathen, and Recoverer from Heathenism. As the clear Light of the Sun is the Thing which makes it a proper Restorative from Darkness; and, therefore, the Sun's being spoken of as such a Remedy, none would suppose to be a good Reason why it should be ranked with Darkness, or among dark Things. And besides (which makes this Supposition of Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s appear more violent) the A∣postle, in this Epistle, does expresly rank himself with the <HI>Jews,</HI> when he speaks of them as distinguished from the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> as in Chap. iii. 9. <HI>What then? are WE better than They?</HI> That is, are we <HI>Jews</HI> better than the <HI>Gentiles?</HI></P>
<P>It can't justly be alledged in Opposition to this, that the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> puts himself with the Heathen. 1 Pet. iv. 3. <HI>For the Time past of OUR Life may suffice US to have wrought the Will of the</HI> Gentiles; <HI>when WE walked in Lasciviousness, Lusts, Excess of Wine, Reviling, Ban∣quetings, &amp; abominable Idolatries.</HI> For the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> (who by the Way was not an Apostle of the Gentiles) here don't speak of himself as one of the Heathen, but as one of the Church of Christ in general, made up of those that had been <HI>Jews, Proselytes</HI> and <HI>Heathen,</HI> who now were all one Body, of which Body he was a Member. 'Tis this Society therefore, and not the Gentiles, that he refers to in the Pronoun US. He is speaking of the Wick∣edness that the Members of this <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Society</HI> had lived in before their Conversion: not that every Member had lived in all those Vices here mentioned, but some in one, others in another. Very parallel with that of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus,</HI> Chap. iii. 3. <HI>For WE our selves</HI> (i.e. We
<PB N="229" REF="008118_0249_0F6B58231AA80920"/>
of the Christian Church) <HI>sometimes also were foolish, dis∣obedient, deceived, serving divers Lusts and Pleasures,</HI> (some one Lust and Pleasure, others another) <HI>living in M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lice, Envy, hateful and hating one another,</HI>&amp;c. There is Nothing in this but what is very natural. That the Apostle, speaking <HI>to</HI> the Christian Church, and <HI>of</HI> that Church, confessing it's former Sins, should speak of him∣self as one of that Society, and yet mention some Sins that he personally had not been guilty of, &amp; among others, heathenish Idolatry, is quite a different Thing from what it would have been for the Apostle, expresly distinguishing those of the Christians which had been Heathen, from those which had been <HI>Jews,</HI> to have ranked himself with the former, tho' he was truly of the latter.</P>
<P>If a Minister in some Congregation in <HI>England,</HI> speak∣ing in a Sermon of the Sins of the Nation, being himself of the Nation, should say, <Q>WE have greatly corrupted our selves, &amp; provoked God by our Deism, our Blasphe∣my, our profane Swearing, our Lasciviousness, our Ve∣nality, &amp;c.</Q> speaking in the first Person plural, tho' h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him∣self never had been a Deist, and perhaps none of his Hear∣ers, and they might also have been generally free from other Sins he mention'd; yet there would be nothing un∣natural in his thus expressing himself. But it would be a quite different Thing, if one Part of the <HI>British</HI> Domi∣nions, suppose our King's <HI>American</HI> Dominions, had uni∣versally apostatized from Christianity to Deism, and had long been in such a State, and if One that had been born and brought up in <HI>England</HI> among Christians, the Country being universally Christian, should be sent among them to shew them the Folly and great Evil of Deism, and convert them to Christianity; and this Missionary, when making a Distinction between <HI>English</HI> Christians, and these Deists, should rank himself with the latter, and say, <HI>WE</HI> Ameri∣can <HI>Deists, We foolish blind Infidels</HI> &amp;c. This indeed would be very unnatural and absurd.</P>
<P>Another Passage of the Apostle, to the like Purpose with that which we have been considering in the 5th of <HI>Romans,</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="008118_0250_0F6B5823939513A8"/>
is that in Eph. ii. 3.—<HI>And were by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others.</HI> This remains a plain Testi∣mony to the Doctrine of original Sin, as held by those that used to be called orthodox Christians, after all the Pains and Art used to torture and pervert it. This Doctrine is here not only plainly and fully taught, but abundantly so, if we take the Words with the Context; where Christians are once and again represented as being, in their first State, <HI>dead in Sin,</HI> and as <HI>quickened,</HI> and <HI>raised up</HI> from such a State of Death, in a most marvellous Display of the free and <HI>rich Grace</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>exceeding Greatness of the Power of God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>With respect to those Words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>We were by Nature Children of Wrath,</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says (P.112, 113, 114.) <Q>The Apostle means no more by this, than <HI>truly</HI> or <HI>really Children of Wrath;</HI> using a metapho∣rical Expression, borrowed from the Word that is used to signify a true and genuine Child of a Family, in Distinction from one that is a Child only by Adoption: To express this we say, he is by Nature a Child.</Q> In which 'tis own'd, that the proper Sense of the Phrase is being a Child by <HI>Nature,</HI> in the same Sense as a Child by Birth or natural Generation; but only he supposes, that here the Word is used <HI>metaphorically.</HI> The Instance he produces as parallel, to confirm his supposed metaphorical Sense of the Phrase, as meaning only <HI>truly, really</HI> or <HI>properly</HI> Children of Wrath, <HI>viz.</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul'</HI>s call∣ing <HI>Timothy</HI> his <HI>own Son in the Faith,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is so far from confirming his Sense, that it is rather directly a∣gainst it. For doubtless the Apostle uses the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in it's original Signification here, meaning his <HI>begotten Son;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> being the Adjective from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Off spring, or the Verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to beget; as much as to say, <HI>Timothy my begotten Son in the Faith;</HI> only allowing for the two Ways of being begotten, spoken of in the new Testament, one natural, and the other spiritual; one being the first Generation, the other Regeneration; the one a being be∣gotten as to the human Nature, the other a being begot∣ten
<PB N="231" REF="008118_0251_0F6B5825C2CAFF10"/>
in the Faith, begotten in Christ, or as to one's Christi∣anity. The Apostle expresly signifies which of these he means in this Place, <HI>Timothy my begotten Son</HI> in the Faith, in the same Manner as he says to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 1 Cor. iv. 15. <HI>In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</HI> To say, the Apostle uses the Word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Eph. ii. 3. only as signifying <HI>real,</HI> true and proper, is a most ar∣bitrary Interpretation, having nothing to warrant it in the whole Bible. The Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is no where used in this Sense in the New-Testament. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following are all the Places where the Word is used.

Jam. iii. 7. twice in that Verse. and 2 Pet. i. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another Thing which our Author alledges to evade the Force of this, is, that the Word render'd <HI>Nature,</HI> some∣times signifies Habit contracted by <HI>Custom,</HI> or an acquired Nature. But this is not the proper Meaning of the Word. And it is plain, the Word in its common Use, in the new Testament, signifies what we properly express in English by the Word <HI>Nature.</HI> There is but one Place where there can be the least Pretext for supposing it to be used other∣wise; and that is 1 Cor. xi. 14. <HI>Doth not even</HI> Nature <HI>it self teach you, that if a Man have long Hair, it is a Shame unto him?</HI> And even here there is, I think, no Manner of Reason for understanding <HI>Nature</HI> otherwise than in the proper Sense. The Emphasis used, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Nature IT SELF,</HI> shews that the Apostle don't mean <HI>Custom,</HI> but Nature in the proper Sense. It is true, it was long Custom, that made having the Head covered a Token of Subjection, and a feminine Habit or Appear∣ance; As 'tis Custom that makes any outward-Action or Word a Sign or Signification of any thing: But Nature <HI>it self,</HI> Nature in its proper Sense, teaches, that it is a Shame for a Man to appear with the established Signs of the female Sex, and with Significations of Inferiority, &amp;c. As Nature it self shews it to be a Shame for a Father to bow down or kneel to his own Child or Servant, or for
<PB N="232" REF="008118_0252_0F6B5825D8C74300"/>
Men to bow to an Ido<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, because bowing down is by Custom an established Token or Sign of Subjection &amp; Submission: Such a Sight therefore would be <HI>unnatural,</HI> shocking to a Man's <HI>very Nature.</HI> So Nature would teach, that 'tis a Shame for a Woman to use such and such lascivious Words or Gestures; tho' it be Custom, that establishes the unclean Signification of those Gestures and Sounds.</P>
<P>'Tis particularly unnatural and unreasonable, to under∣stand the Phrase, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in this Place, any otherwise than in the proper Sense, on the following Accounts. 1. It may be observed, that both the Words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in their original Signification, have Reference to the Birth or Generation. So the Word. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which comes from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which signifies to beget or bring forth Young, or to put forth, or bud forth as a Plant, that brings forth young Buds and Branches. And so the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> comes from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which signifies to bring forth Children.—2. As tho' the Apostle took Care by the Word used here, to signify what we are by Birth, he changes the Word he used before for Children. In the preceeding Verse he used <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> speaking of the <HI>Children</HI> of Disobedience;—but here <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which is a Word derived, as was now observed, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to bring forth a Child, and more properly signifies a <HI>be∣gotten</HI> or <HI>born Child.</HI>—3. 'Tis natural to suppose that the Apostle here speaks in Opposition to the Pride of some, especially the <HI>Jews</HI> (for the Church in <HI>Ephesus</HI> was made up partly of <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as the Church in <HI>Rome</HI>) who exalted themselves in the Privileges they had by <HI>Birth,</HI> because they were <HI>born</HI> the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and were <HI>Jews by Nature,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as the Phrase is, Gal. ii. 15. In Opposition to this proud Conceit, he teaches the <HI>Jews,</HI> that notwithstanding this they were <HI>by Nature</HI> Chil∣dren of Wrath, <HI>even as others,</HI> i. e. as well as the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> which the <HI>Jews</HI> had been taught to look upon as <HI>Sinners,</HI> and out of Favour with God by <HI>Nature,</HI> and <HI>born Chil∣dren of Wrath.</HI>—4. 'Tis more plain, that the Apostle uses the Word <HI>Nature</HI> in its proper Sense here, because he sets what they were <HI>by Nature,</HI> in Opposition to what they are
<PB N="233" REF="008118_0253_0F6B5826EB939420"/>
<HI>by Grace.</HI> In this Verse, the Apostle shews what they are <HI>by Nature, viz.</HI> Children of Wrath; and in the following Verses he shews, how very different their State is <HI>by Grace;</HI> saying, v. 5. <HI>By Grace ye are saved;</HI> repeating it again v. 8. <HI>By Grace ye are saved;</HI> But if, by being Children of Wrath by Nature, were meant no more than only their being <HI>really</HI> and <HI>truly</HI> Children of Wrath, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> sup∣poses, there would be no Opposition in the Signification of these Phrases; for in this Sense they were <HI>by Nature</HI> in a State <HI>of Salvation,</HI> as much as <HI>by Nature Children of Wrath:</HI> for they were <HI>truly, really</HI> and <HI>properly</HI> in a State of Salvation.</P>
<P>If we take these Words with the Context, the whole abundantly proves, that by Nature we are <HI>totally corrupt,</HI> without any good Thing in us. For if we allow the plain Scope of the Place, without attempting to hide it, by ex∣treme Violence used with the Apostle's Words &amp;Expressions, the Design here is strongly to establish this Point; That what Christians have that is good in them, or in their State, <HI>is in no Part</HI> of it naturally in themselves, or from them∣selve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but is <HI>wholly from divine Grace,</HI> all <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> and <HI>his Workmanship,</HI> the Effect of his Power, and free and wonderful Love: None of our <HI>good Works</HI> are primarily from ourselves, but with respect to 'em all, <HI>we are God's Workmanship, created unto good Works,</HI> as it were out of Nothing: Not so much as <HI>Faith itself,</HI> the first Principle of good Works in Christians, is of themselves, but that <HI>is the Gift of God.</HI> Therefore the Apostle com∣pares the Work of God, in forming Christians to true Vir∣tue and Holiness, not only to a <HI>new Creation,</HI> but a <HI>Re∣surrection,</HI> or raising from the Dead. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>You hath he quicken'd, who were dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> And again v. 5. <HI>Even when we were dead in Sins, hath he quicken'd us together with Christ.</HI> In speaking of Christians being quicken'd with Christ, the Apostle has Reference to what he had said before, in the latter Part of the foregoing Chapter, of God's manifesting <HI>the exceeding Greatness of his Power</HI> towards Christian Converts, in their Conversion,

<HI>agreable to the Operation of his mighty Power, when he raised Christ from the dead.</HI> So that it is plain by every thing in this Discourse, the Apostle would signify that <HI>by Nature</HI> we have <HI>no Goodness;</HI> but are as destitute of it as a dead Corpse is of Life: And that all Goodness, all good Works, and Faith the Principle of all, are perfectly the Gift of God's Grace, and the Work of his great, al∣mighty and exceeding excellent Power. I think, there can be need of Nothing but reading the Chapter, and minding what is read, to convince all who have common Under∣standing, of this; whatever any of the most subtil Criticks have done, or even can do, to twist, rack, perplex &amp; per∣vert the Words and Phrases here used.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> here again insists, that the Apostle speaks only of the Gentiles in their heathen State, when he speaks of those that were <HI>dead in Sin,</HI> and <HI>by Nature Children of Wrath;</HI> and that tho' he seems to include himself among these, saying, <HI>WE were by Nature Children of Wrath, WE were dead in Sins,</HI> yet he only puts himself among them because he was the Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The gross Absurdity of which may appear from what was said before. But besides the things which have been already observed, there are some things which make it peculiarly unreasonable to understand it so here. 'Tis true, the grea∣ter Part of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> had been Heathens, and therefore the Apostle often has Reference to their hea∣then State, in this Epistle. But the Words in this Chap. ii. 3. plainly shew, that he means himself and other <HI>Jews,</HI> in Distinction from the <HI>Gentiles:</HI> for the Distinction is fully express'd. After he had told the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> who had been generally Heathen, that they had been dead in Sin, and had walk'd according to the Course of this World, &amp;c. v. 1, and 2. he makes a <HI>Distinction,</HI> and says, <HI>Among whom WE ALSO had our Conversation,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and were by Nature Children of Wrath. EVEN AS OTHERS.</HI> Here first he changes the Person; whereas, before he had spoken in the second Person, <HI>YE were dead,</HI>—<HI>YE in time past walked,</HI> &amp;c. Now he changes Stile, and uses the
<PB N="235" REF="008118_0255_0F6B5828CD8B29C0"/>
first Person, in a most manifest Distinction, <HI>Among whom WE ALSO,</HI> that is, <HI>we Jews,</HI> as well as <HI>ye Gentiles.</HI> Not only changing the Person, but adding a Particle of Distinction, <HI>Also;</HI> which would be Nonsense, if he meant the same without Distinction. And besides all this, more fully to express the Distinction, the Apostle further adds a Pronoun of Distinction; <HI>WE also, even as OTHERS,</HI> or, we as well as others: most evidently having respect to the Notions, so generally entertain'd by the <HI>Jews,</HI> of their being much better than the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in being <HI>Jews by Nature,</HI> Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and Children of God; when they supposed the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to be utterly cast off, as <HI>born Aliens,</HI> and <HI>by Nature Children of Wrath.</HI> In Opposition to this, the Apostle says, 'We <HI>Jews,</HI> after all our glorying in our Distinction, <HI>were by Nature Children of Wrath, as well as the rest of the World.'</HI> And a yet further Evidence, that the Apostle here means to include the <HI>Jews,</HI> and even himself, is the universal Term he uses, <HI>Among whom also we ALL had our Conversation,</HI> &amp;c. Thô Wickedness was supposed by the <HI>Jews</HI> to be the <HI>Course of this World,</HI> as to the Generality of Mankind, yet they supposed themselves an exempt People, at least the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and the devout Observers of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and Traditions of the Elders; whatever might be thought of <HI>Publicans and Harlots.</HI> But in Opposition to this, the Apostle asserts, that <HI>they all</HI> were no better by Nature than others, but were to be reckon'd among the <HI>Children of Disobedience,</HI> and <HI>Children of Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>And then besides, if the Apostle chuses to put himself among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> because he was the Apostle of the Gentiles, I would ask, why he don't do so in the 11<HI>th</HI> v. of the same Chapter, where he speaks of their <HI>Gentile</HI> State expresly? <HI>Remember that YE being in time past Gentiles in the Flesh.</HI>—Why does he here make a Dis∣tinction between the Gentiles and himself? Why did he not say, Let <HI>us</HI> remember, that <HI>we</HI> being in past Time <HI>Gen∣tiles?</HI> And why does the same Apostle, even universally, make the same Distinction, speaking either in the second
<PB N="236" REF="008118_0256_0F6B58299D7707A0"/>
or third Person, and never in the first, where he expresly speaks of the <HI>Gentilism</HI> of those that he wrote to; or speaks of 'em with Reference to their Distinction from the <HI>Jews?</HI> So every where in this same Epistle; as, in Chap. i. 12,13. where the Distinction is made just in the same Manner as here, by the Change of the Person, and by the distin∣guishing Particle, <HI>Also, That WE should be to the Praise of his Glory who first trusted in Christ</HI> [the first Be∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evers in Christ being of the <HI>Jews,</HI> before the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called] <HI>In whom YE ALSO trusted, after that ye heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of your Salvation.</HI> And in all the following Part of this second Chapter; as v. 11, 17, 19. and 22. In which last Verse the same distinguishing Particle again is used; <HI>In whom YOU ALSO are builded together for an Habitation of God thro' the Spirit.</HI> See also in the following Chapters; Chap. iii. 6. and iv. 17. And not only in this Epistle, but constantly in other Epistles: as, Rom. i. 12, 13. Chap. xi. 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 30, 30, 31. Chap. xv. 15, 16. 1 Cor. xii. 2. Gal. iv. 8.

<P>Tho' I am far from thinking our Author's Exposition of the 7th Chap. of <HI>Romans</HI> to be in any wise agreable to the true Sense of the Apostle, yet it is needless here to stand particularly to examine it; because the Doctrine of original Sin may be argued not the less strongly, tho' we should allow the Thing wherein he mainly differs from such as he opposes in his Interpretation, <HI>viz.</HI> That the A∣postle don't speak in his own Name, or to represent the State of a true Christian, but as representing the State of the <HI>Jews</HI> under the Law. For even on this Supposition, the Drift of the Place will prove, that every one who is under the Law, and with equal Reason every one of Mankind, <HI>is carnal, sold under Sin,</HI> in his first State, and till deliver'd by Christ. For, tis plain, that the Apostle's Design is to shew the Insufficiency of the Law to give Life to any one whatsoever. This appears by what he says when he comes to draw his Conclusion, in the Continuation of this

Discourse; Chap. viii. 3.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself reckons this a Part of the same Discourse or Paragraph, in the Division he makes of the Epistle, in his <HI>Paraphrase</HI> and <HI>Notes</HI> upon it.</NOTE> <HI>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Flesh; 'God, sending his own Son,</HI> &amp;c.

Which is the Thing that through this Chapter he insists on as the grand Hindrance and Reason why the Law could not give Life, just as he does in his Conclusion, Chap. viii. 3.

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Remarks on Dr. T—r's▪ Way of explaining this Text.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Things are worthy to be taken Notice of, concerning our Author's Exposition of this re∣markable Passage of the Apostle <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. He greatly insists that by <HI>Death</HI> in this Place no more is meant, than that Death which we all die, when this present Life is extinguished, and the Body returns to the Dust; that no more is meant in the 12, 14, 15, and 17th Verses. P. 27. he speaks of it as <HI>evidently, clearly and infallibly so,</HI> because the Apostle is still discoursing on the same Subject; plainly implying, that it must most <HI>infallibly</HI> be so, that the Apostle means no more by Death, through∣out this Paragraph on the Subject. But as infallible as this is, if we believe what Dr.<HI>T.</HI> elsewhere says, it must needs be otherwise. He, in P.396, speaking of those Words in the last Verse of the next Chapter, <HI>The Wages of Sin is DEATH, but the Gift of God is ETERNAL LIFE, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord,</HI> says, <Q>Death in this Place is widely different from the Death we <HI>now die;</HI> as it stands there <HI>opposed to eternal Life,</HI> which is the Gift of God thro' Jesus Christ, it manifestly signifies <HI>eternal Death,</HI> the <HI>second Death,</HI> or that Death which they shall <HI>here after die,</HI> who live after the Flesh.</Q> But Death, in the Conclusion of the Paragraph we are upon in the 5th Chapter, concerning the Death that comes by <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Life that comes by Christ, in the last v. of the Chapter, is <HI>opposed to eternal Life,</HI> just in the same Man∣ner
<PB N="239" REF="008118_0259_0F6B582BC44F8018"/>
as it is in the last v. of the next Chapter. <HI>That as Sin has reigned unto DEATH, even so might Grace reign, thro' Righteousness, unto ETERNAL LIFE, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> So that by our Author's own Ar∣gument, Death in this Place also is <HI>manifestly widely differ∣ent from the Death we now die, as it stands</HI> here <HI>opposed to eternal Life thro' Jesus Christ; and signifies eternal Death, the second Death.</HI> And yet this is a Part of the same Discourse or Paragraph with that begun in the 12th v. as reckon'd by Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself in his Division of Para∣graphs, in his Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistle. So that if we will follow him, and admit his Reasonings in the various Parts of his Book, here is <HI>manifest</HI> Proof, against <HI>infallible</HI> Evidence! So that 'tis true, the Apostle through∣out this whole Passage on the same Subject, by Death, <HI>evi∣dently, clearly</HI> and <HI>infallibly means no more, than that Death we now die, when this Life is extinguished;</HI> and yet by Death, in some Part of this Passage, is meant some∣thing <HI>widely different from the Death we now die,</HI> and is <HI>MANIFESTLY</HI> intended <HI>eternal Death, the se∣cond Death.</HI></P>
<P>But had our Author been more consistent with himself in his laying of it down as so certain and <HI>infallible,</HI> that because the Apostle has a special Respect to temporal Death, in the 14th v. <HI>Death reigned from</HI> Adam <HI>to</HI> Moses, therefore he means no more in the several conse∣quent Parts of this Passage, yet he is doubtless too confident and positive in this Matter. This is no more <HI>evident, clear</HI> and <HI>infallible,</HI> than that Christ meant no more by <HI>perishing,</HI> in Luke xiii. 5. when he says, <HI>I tell you, Nay, but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</HI> than such a tempo∣ral Death, as came on those that died by the Fall of the Tower of <HI>Siloam,</HI> spoken of in the preceeding Words of the same Speech: and no more infallible, than that by <HI>Life,</HI> Christ means no more than this temporal Life, in each Part of that one Sentence, Matt. x. 39. <HI>He that findeth his</HI> Life, <HI>shall lose</HI> it; <HI>and he that loseth his</HI> Life for my Sake, <HI>shall find</HI> it; because in the first Part
<PB N="240" REF="008118_0260_0F6B582C8F982060"/>
of each Clause he has respect especially to temporal Life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many Places parallel with these, as Joh. xi. 25, 26. <HI>I am the Resurrection, and the Life: He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall be live: and whosoever liveth, and believ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th in me, shall never die.</HI> Here both the Words, <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> are used with this Variation; <HI>I am the Resurrection, and the Life,</HI> meaning spiritual and eternal Life: <HI>He that be∣lieveth in me, though he were dead,</HI> having respect to temporal Death, <HI>yet shall be live,</HI> with respect to spiritual Life, and the Restoration of the Life of the Body. <HI>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die,</HI> meaning a spiritual and eternal Death. So in Joh. vi. 49, 50. <HI>Your Fathers did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in the Wilderness, and are dead,</HI> having respect chiefly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emporal Death. <HI>This is the Bread which cometh down from Heaven, that a Man may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereof, and not die,</HI> i. e. by the Loss of spiritual Life, &amp; by eternal Death. (See also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) And in the next ver. <HI>If any Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of this Bread, he shall live forever,</HI> have eternal Life. So ver. 54. See another like Instance, Joh. v. 24,—29.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Truth of the Case with respect to what the Apo∣stle intends by the Word <HI>Death</HI> in this Place, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the same Thing is meant, as is meant by Death in the foregoing and following Parts of this Epistle, and other Writings of this Apostle, where he speaks of Death as the Consequence of Sin, namely, the Whole of that Death, which He, and the Scripture every where, speaks of as the proper Wages and Punishment of Sin, including Death temporal, spiritual and eternal; tho' in some Parts of this Discourse he has a more special respect to one Part of this Whole, in others to another, as his Argument leads him; without any more Variation, than is common in the same Discourse. That Life which the Scripture speaks of as the Reward of Righteousness, is a Whole containing seve∣ral Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> The Life of the Body, Union of Soul and Body, and the most perfect Sensibility, Activity &amp; Felicity of both, which is the chief Thing. In like Manner the Death, which the Scripture speaks of as the Punishment of Sin, is a Whole including the Death of the Body, and the Death of the Soul, and the eternal, sensible, perfect De∣struction
<PB N="241" REF="008118_0261_0F6B582DA2262830"/>
and Misery of both. 'Tis this latter Whole, that the Apostle speaks of by the Name of Death in this Dis∣course, in Rom. v▪ Tho' in some Sentences he has a more special Respect to one Part, in others to another: And this without changing the Signification of the Word. For an having Respect to several Things included in the extensive Signification of the Word, is not the same thing as using the Word in several distinct Significations. As for Instance, the Appellative, <HI>Man,</HI> or the proper Name of any particular Man, is the Name of a Whole, including the different Parts of Soul &amp; Body. And if any one in speak∣ing of <HI>James</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> should say, he was a wise <HI>Man,</HI> and a beautiful <HI>Man;</HI> in the former Part of the Sentence, Respect would be had more especially to his Soul, in the latter to his Body, in the Word <HI>Man:</HI> But yet without any proper Change of the Signification of the Name, to distinct Senses. In Joh. xxi. 7. it is said, <HI>Peter was naked,</HI> and in the following Part of the same Story 'tis said, <HI>Peter was grieved.</HI> In the former Proposition, Respect is had especially to his Body, in the latter to his Soul: But yet here is no proper Change of the Meaning of the Name, <HI>Peter.</HI> And as to the Apostle's Use of the Word <HI>Death,</HI> in the Passage now under Consideration, on the Supposition that he in the general means the whole of that Death which is the Wages of Sin, there is nothing but what is perfectly natural in supposing, that he, in order to evince, that Death, the proper Punishment of Sin, comes on all Mankind, in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, should take Notice of that Part of this Punishment, which is visi∣ble in this World, and which every Body therefore sees does in Fact come on all Mankind (as in v. 14.) and from thence should infer, that all Mankind are exposed to the whole of that Death which is the proper Punishment of Sin, whereof that temporal Death which is visible, is a Part, and a visible Image of the whole, and (unless changed by divine Grace) an Introduction to the principal, and infi∣nitely the most dreadful Part.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="242" REF="008118_0262_0F6B582E0386B5C0"/>II. Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Explanation of this Passage makes wholly insignificant those first Words, <HI>By one Man, Sin enter'd into the World,</HI> and leaves this Proposition with∣out any Sense or Signification at all. The Apostle had been largely and elaborately representing, how the whole World was full of Sin, in all Parts of it, both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and all exposed to Death &amp; Condemnation. 'Tis plain, that in these Words he would tell us, how this came to pass, namely, that this sorrowful Event came <HI>by one Man,</HI> even the first Man. That the World was full of Sin, and full of Death, were two great and notorious Facts, deeply affecting the Interests of Mankind; and they seemed very wonderful Facts, drawing the Attention of the more thinking Part of Mankind every where, who often asked this Question, <HI>Whence comes Evil,</HI> moral and natural Evil? (The latter chiefly visible in Death.) 'Tis manifest, the Apostle here means to tell us, how these came into the World, and came to prevail in it as they do. But all that is meant, according to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Interpretation, is, <HI>" He begun Transgression."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 56.</NOTE> As if all that the Apo∣stle meant, was, to tell us who happen'd to sin first; not how such a Malady came upon the World, or how any one in the World, besides <HI>Adam</HI> himself, came by such a Distemper. The Words of the Apostle, <HI>By one Man Sin entered INTO THE WORLD, and Death by Sin,</HI> shew the Design to be, to tell us how these Evils came, as affecting the State of <HI>the World;</HI> and not only as reaching one Man in the World. If this were not plain enough in itself, the Words immediately following demonstrate it; <HI>And so Death passed upon ALL MEN, for that all have sinned.</HI> By <HI>Sin's being in the World,</HI> the Apostle don't mean being in the World only in that <HI>one Instance</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI> first Transgression, but being <HI>abroad in the World,</HI> among the Inhabitants of the Earth, in a wide Extent and continued Series of Wickedness; as is plain in the first Words of the next Verse, <HI>For until the Law, Sin was
<PB N="243" REF="008118_0263_0F6B582ECB7C6E00"/>
IN THE WORLD.</HI> And therefore when he gives us an Account how it came to be <HI>in the World,</HI> or which is the same Thing, how it <HI>enter'd into the World,</HI> he don't mean only coming in in one Instance.</P>
<P>If the Case were as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> represents, that the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> either in its Pollution or Punishment, reached none but himself, any more than the Sin of any other Man, it would be no more proper to say, that <HI>by one Man Sin enter'd into the World,</HI> than if it should be enquired, how Mankind came into <HI>America,</HI> and there had antiently been a Ship of the <HI>Phenicians</HI> wreck'd at Sea, and a single Man of the Crew was driven ashore on this Continent, and here died as soon as he reached the Shore, and it should be said, <HI>By that one Man Mankind came into America.</HI></P>
<P>And besides, it is not true that by <HI>one Man,</HI> or by <HI>Adam,</HI> Sin enter'd into World, in Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Sense: For it was not he, but <HI>Eve,</HI> that <HI>begun Transgression.</HI> By one Man Dr. <HI>T.</HI> understands <HI>Adam,</HI> as the Figure of Christ. And it is plain, that it was for his Transgression, and not <HI>Eve's,</HI> that the Sentence of Death was pronounced on Mankind after the Fall, Gen. iii. 19. It appears unreasonable to suppose the Apostle means to include <HI>Eve,</HI> when he speaks of <HI>Adam:</HI> for he lays great Stress on it, that it was <HI>BY ONE,</HI>—repeating it no less than seven Times.</P>
<P N="3">III. In like Manner this Author brings to Nothing the Sense of the causal Particles, in such Phrases as these, so often repeated, <HI>Death BY Sin,</HI> v. 12. <HI>If THROUGH the Offence of one, many be dead,</HI> v. 15. <HI>BY one that sinned,—Judgment was BY one to Condemnation,</HI> v. 16. <HI>BY one Man's Offence, Death reigned BY one,</HI> v. 17. <HI>BY the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all,</HI> &amp;c.v. 18. <HI>BY one Man's Disobedience,</HI> v. 19. These causal Par∣ticles, so dwelt upon, and so variously repeated, unless we make meer Nonsense of the Discourse, signify some Con∣nection and Dependence, by some Sort of Influence of that Sin of one Man, or some Tendency to that Effect which is so often said to come <HI>BY</HI> it. But according to Dr. <HI>T.</HI> there can be no <HI>real</HI> Dependence or Influence in the Case,
<PB N="244" REF="008118_0264_0F6B582FAE8996E8"/>
of any Sort whatsoever. There is no Connection by any <HI>natural</HI> Influence of that one Act to make all Mankind mortal. Our Author don't pretend to account for this Effect in any such Manner; but in another most diverse, <HI>viz,</HI> A gracious Act of God, laying Mankind under A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>licti∣on, Toil and Death, from special Favour and Kindness. Nor can there be any Dependence of this Effect on that Transgression of <HI>Adam,</HI> by any <HI>moral</HI> Influence, as de∣serving such a Consequence, or exposing to it on any <HI>mo∣ral Account:</HI> For he supposes, that Mankind are not in this way exposed to the least Degree of Evil. Nor has this Effect any <HI>legal</HI> Dependence on that Sin, or any Con∣nection by Virtue of any antecedent Constitution, which God had establish'd with <HI>Adam:</HI> For he insist, that in that Threatning, <HI>In the Day thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alt die,</HI> there is not a Word said of his Posterity; And Death on Mankind, according to him, can't come by Virtue of that legal Constitution with <HI>Adam;</HI> because the Sentence by which it came, was after the annulling and abolishing that Constitution. And 'tis manifest, that this Consequence can't be through any Kind of <HI>Tendency</HI> of that Sin to such an Effect; because the Effect comes only as a Benefit, and is the Fruit of meer Favour: But Sin has no Tendency, either <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral,</HI> to Benefits and divine Favours, And that Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> could neither be the <HI>efficient</HI> Cause, nor the <HI>procuring</HI> Cause, neither the <HI>natural, moral</HI> nor <HI>legal</HI> Cause, nor an <HI>exciting</HI> and <HI>moving</HI> Cause, any more than <HI>Adam's</HI> eating of any other Tree of the Garden. And the only real Relation that the Effect can have to that Sin, is a Relation as to Time, <HI>viz.</HI> that 'tis <HI>after</HI> it. And when the Matter is closely examined, the whole amounts to no more than this, That God is pleased, of his meer good▪ Will and Pleasure, to bestow a greater Favour upon us, than he did upon <HI>Adam</HI> in Innocency, <HI>after that Sin</HI> of his eating the forbidden Fruit; which Sin we are no more concerned in, than in the Sin of the King of <HI>Pegù,</HI> or Em∣pero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="245" REF="008118_0265_0F6B583042564058"/>IV. 'Tis altogether inconsistent with the Apostle's Scope, and the Import of what he says, to suppose that the Death which he here speaks of as coming on Mankind by <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, comes not as a Punishment, but only as a Fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur. It quite makes void the Opposition, in which the Apostle sets the Consequences of <HI>Adam's Sin,</HI> and the Consequences of the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Righteousness of Christ.</HI> They are set in Opposition to each other, as opposite Effects, arising from opposite Causes, throughout the Paragraph. One as the <HI>just Consequence of an Offence,</HI> the other a <HI>free Gift.</HI> v.15, 16, 17, 18. Whereas, according to this Scheme, there is no such Opposition in the Case; both are Benefits, and both are free Gifts.

<P><PB N="246" REF="008118_0266_0F6B5832EBC93A80"/>But to return, 'tis plain, that Death by <HI>Adam,</HI> and Life and Happiness by <HI>Christ,</HI> are here set in Opposition; the latter being spoken of as <HI>good,</HI> the other as <HI>evil;</HI> one as the Effect of <HI>Righteousness,</HI> the other of an <HI>Offence;</HI> one the Fruit of <HI>Obedience,</HI> the other of <HI>Disobedience;</HI> one as the Fruit of <HI>God's Favour,</HI> in Consequence of what was <HI>pleasing</HI> and <HI>acceptable</HI> to him, but the other the Fruit of his <HI>Displeasure,</HI> in Consequence of what was <HI>displeasing</HI> and <HI>hateful</HI> to him: the latter coming by <HI>Justification,</HI> the former by the <HI>Condemnation</HI> of the Subject.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To suppose that there is no Law in Being, by which Men are exposed to Death for <HI>personal Sins,</HI> where or when the revealed Law of God in or after <HI>Moses's</HI> Time is not in Being, is <HI>contrary to this Apostle's own Doctrine</HI> in this Epistle.

<P>So that in our Author's Way of explaining the Passage before us, the grand Arg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t, which the Apostle insists upon here, to prove his main Point <HI>viz.</HI> that D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th don't come by Men's <HI>personal Sins,</HI> but by <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, because it came <HI>before</HI> the Law was given, that threaten'd Death for Per∣sonal Sin; I say, this Argument which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes so clear and strong, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 393.</NOTE> is brought to Nothing more than a meer Shadow without Substance; the very Foundation of the Argument having no Truth. To say, there was no such Law actually express'd in any standing Revelation, would be meer Trifling: For it no more appears, that God would not bring temporal Death for personal Sins, without a standing revealed Law threatning it, than that he would not bring eternal Death before there was a re∣vealed Law threatning that: which yet wicked Men that lived in <HI>Noah's</HI> Time, were exposed to, as appears by

1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 19, 20. and which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes all Mankind are exposed to by their personal Sins; and he himself says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 77, 78.</NOTE> Sin in it's own unalterable Nature leads to Death.—Yet, it might be argued with as much Strength of Reason, that God could bring an Men no Punishment at all for any Sin, that was committed from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> because there was no standing revealed Law then extant, threatning any Punishment. It may here be properly observed, that our Author supposes, the shortening of Man's Days, and hastening-of Death, <HI>entered into the World by the Sin of the Antedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vians,</HI> in the same Sense as Death and Mortality entered into the World by <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 68.</NOTE> But where was there any standing revealed Law for that, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Event was so universal? If God might bring this on all Mankind, on Occasion of <HI>other</HI> Men's Sins, for which they deserved Nothing, without a revealed Law, what could there be to hinder God's bringing Death on Men for their <HI>personal</HI> Sins, for which their own Consciences tell 'em they do deserve Death, without a revealed Law?</P>
<P N="2">2. If it had been so, that from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses</HI> there had been no Law in Being, of any Kind, revealed or natu∣ral by which Men could be properly exposed to tempo∣ral Death for personal Sin, yet the Mention of <HI>Moses's</HI> Law would have been wholly, impertinent, and of no Sig∣nification in the Argument, according to our Author's un∣derstanding of it. He supposes, what the Apostle would prove, is, that <HI>temporal</HI> Death, or the Death we now die, comes by <HI>Adam;</HI> and not by any Law threatening such a Punishment for personal Sin; because this Death pre∣vail'd before the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was in Being, which is the only Law threatning Death for personal Sin. And yet he himself supposes, that the Law of <HI>Moses, when it was in Being,</HI> threatened <HI>no such Death</HI> for personal Sin. For he abundantly asserts, that the Death which the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> threatned for personal Sin, was <HI>eternal Death,</HI> as has been already noted: And he says in express Terms, that
<PB N="252" REF="008118_0272_0F6B583704B85408"/>
eternal Death is of a Nature <HI>widely different from the Death we now die;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 396. He says to the like Purpose in his Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 17.</NOTE> as was also observed before.</P>
<P>How impertinently therefore does Dr. <HI>T.</HI> make an in∣spired Writer argue, when according to him the Apostle would prove, that <HI>this Kind of Death</HI> did not come by any Law threatening <HI>this Kind of Death,</HI> because it came before the Existence of a Law threatning <HI>another Kind of Death,</HI> of a Nature <HI>widely different?</HI> How is it to the Apostle's Purpose, to fix on that Period, the Time of giving <HI>Moses's</HI> Law, as if that had been the Period where∣in Men began to be threaten'd with <HI>this Punishment,</HI> for their personal Sins, when in Truth it was no such Thing? And therefore it was no more to his Pur∣pose, to fix on that Period, from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> than from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> or any other Period whatsoever. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> holds, that even now, since the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> has been given, the Mortality of Mankind, or the Death we now die, don't come by that Law; but that it always comes only by <HI>Adam.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is plain by what he says, P. 38, 40, 53, 393.</NOTE> And if it <HI>never comes</HI> by that Law, we may be sure it <HI>never was threatned</HI> in that Law.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we should allow the Argument in Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Sense of it, to prove that Death don't come by <HI>personal Sin,</HI> yet it will be wholly without Force to prove the main Point, even that it must come by <HI>Adam's Sin.</HI> For it might come by God's sovereign and gracious Pleasure; as innu∣merable other divine Benefits do. If it be ordered, agrea∣ble to our Author's Supposition, not as a Punishment, nor as a Calamity, but only a <HI>Favour,</HI> what Necessity of any settled Constitution, or revealed Sentence, in order to the bestowing such a Favour, more than other Favours; and particularly more than that <HI>great Benefit,</HI> which he says entred into the World by the Sin of the <HI>Antediluvians,</HI> the shortening Men's Lives so much after the Flood?—Thus the Apostle's arguing, by Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Explanation of it, is turned into meer Trifling, and a vain and imperti∣nent Use of Words, without any real Force or Significance.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="253" REF="008118_0273_0F6B5837CDE2BFA0"/>VI.

<P>I will first consider the Sense he puts upon the two for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Condemnation.</HI> He often calls this Condemnation a <HI>judicial Act,</HI> and a <HI>Sentence of Condem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion▪</HI> But, according to his Scheme, 'tis a judicial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Condemnation pass'd upon them that are perfectly innocent, and view'd by the Judge, even in his passing the Sentence &amp; condemning them, as having no Guilt of Sin, or Fault at all chargeable upon them; and a <HI>judicial Pro∣ceeding, passing Sentence</HI> arbitrarily, without any Law or Rule of Right, before established: For there was no pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ding Law or Rule threatning Death, that he, or any one else, ever pretended to have been established, but only this, <HI>In the Day that thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest thereof, thou shalt sure∣ly die.</HI> And concerning this, be insists, that there is not a Word said in it of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity. So that the Con∣demnation spoken of, it a Sentence of Condemnation to Death, for, or in Consequence of the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> with∣out any Law, by which that Sin could be imputed, to bring any such Consequence; contrary to the Apostle's plain
<PB N="255" REF="008118_0275_0F6B583943D308D0"/>
Scope. And not only so, but over and above all this, 'tis a <HI>judicial Sentence of Condemnation</HI> to that which is no Calamity, nor is considered as such in the Sentence: but 'tis Condemnation to a great Favour!</P>
<P>The Apostle uses the Words, <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Condem∣nation,</HI> in other Places; they are no strange and unusual Terms with him: But never are they used by him in this Sense, or any like it; Nor are they ever used thus any where else in the New-Testament. This Apostle else∣where in this Epistle to the <HI>Roman's</HI> is often speaking of <HI>Condemnation;</HI> using the same or similar Terms &amp; Phrases, as here; but never in the above said Sense. Chap. ii. 1, 2, 3. Six Times in these Verses; also v. 12 &amp; 27. and Chap. iii. 7. Chap. viii. 1 &amp; 3. Chap. xiv. 3, 4. &amp; v. 10. v. 13. v. 22, &amp; 23. This will be plain to every one that casts his Eye on these Places. And if we look into the former Part of this Chapter, the Apostle's Discourse here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it evident, that he is here speaking of a Condemnation, that is no Testimony of Favour to the innocent; but of God's Displeasure, towards those that he is not reconciled to, but looks on as Offenders, Sinners, and Enemies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the Objects of his Wrath, which we are delivered from by Christ; as may be seen in <HI>Verses</HI> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 &amp; 11.</P>
<P>And viewing this Discourse it self, in the very Paragraph we are upon, if we may judge any thing by Language and manner of Speaking, there is every thing to lead us to suppose, that the Apostle uses these Words here, as he does elsewhere, properly, and as implying a Supposition of Sin, chargeable on the Subject, and exposing to Punishment. He speaks of Condemnation with reference to Sin, as what comes by Sin, and as a Condemnation to Death, which seems to be a most terrible Evil, and capital Punish∣ment, even in what is temporal and visible; and this in the Way of <HI>Judgment</HI> and Execution of Justice, in Oppo∣sition to <HI>Grace</HI> or <HI>Favour,</HI> and <HI>Gift</HI> or a Benefit coming by Favour. And Sin and Offence, Transgression and Disobedience are, over and over again, spoken of as the Ground of the Condemnation and of the capital Suffering
<PB N="256" REF="008118_0276_0F6B583A014F5B90"/>
condemned to,—for ten Verses successively, that is, in every Verse in the whole Paragraph, without missing one.</P>
<P>The Words, <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> are ex∣plained by Dr. <HI>T.</HI> in a no less unreasonable Manner. He understands <HI>Justification</HI> in v. 18th, and <HI>Righteousness</HI> in v. 19th,—in such a Sense, as to suppose 'em to belong to all, and actually to be applied to all Mankind, good and bad, Believers &amp; Unbelievers; to the worst Enemies of God, remaining such, as well as his peculiar Favourites, &amp; many that never had any Sin imputed to 'em; meaning thereby no more than what is fulfilled in an universal Resurrection from the Dead, at the last Day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So P. 47. 49, 49, 60, 61, 62, and other Places.</NOTE> Now this is a most arbitrary, forced Sense. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Terms are used every where, all over the New Testament, yet nothing like such an Use of 'em is to be found, in any one Instance, thro' all the Writings of the Apostles &amp; Evangelists. The Words, <HI>Justify, Justification,</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> as from God to Men, are never used but to signify a Privilege belonging only <HI>to some,</HI> and that which is peculiar to <HI>distinguished Favourites.</HI> This Apostle in particular, above all the other Writers of the new Testament, abounds in the Use of these Terms; so that we have all imaginable Oppor∣tunity to understand his Language, and know the Sense in which he uses these Words: But he never elsewhere uses 'em in the Sense supposed here, nor is there any Pretence that he does. Above all, does this Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Use of these Terms in this Epistle. JUSTIFICATION is the Subject he had been upon through all the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d∣ing Part of the Epistle. It was the grand Subject of all the foregoing Chapters, and the preceeding Part of this Chapter; where these Terms are continually repeated. And the Word, <HI>Justification,</HI> is constantly used to signify something peculiar to Believers, who had been Sinners; implying some Reconciliation and Forgiveness of Sin, and special Privilege in Nearness to God, above the rest of the World. Yea, the Word is constantly used thus, according
<PB N="257" REF="008118_0277_0F6B583B22C8C518"/>
to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s own Explanations, in his Paraphrase and Notes on this Epistle. And there is not the least Reason to suppose but that he is still speaking of the same <HI>Justi∣fication</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which he had dwelt upon from the Beginning, to this Place. He speaks of <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> here, just in the same Manner, as he had done in the preceeding Part of the Epistle. He had all along spoken of Justification as standing in Relation to <HI>Sin,</HI> Disobedience to God, and Offence against God, and so he does here: He had before been speaking of Justi∣fication thro' free <HI>Grace,</HI> and so he does here: He before had been speaking of Justification through <HI>Righteousness,</HI> as in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and so he does here.</P>
<P>And if we look into the former Part of this very Chapter, there we shall find <HI>Justification</HI> spoken of just in the same Sense as in the rest of the Epistle; which is also supposed by our Author in his Exposition: 'Tis still <HI>Justification by Faith, Justification</HI> of them that had been <HI>Sinners, Justification</HI> attended with <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> Justification peculiar to them that had <HI>the Love of God shed abroad in their Hearts.</HI> The Apostle's foregoing Discourse on Justification by Grace, through Faith, and what he had so greatly insisted on as the Evidence of the Truth of this Doctrine, even the universal Sinfulness of Mankind in their original State, is plainly what introduces this Dis∣course in the latter Part of this 5th Chapter; where he shews how all Mankind came to be sinful and miserable, and so to need this Grace of God, and Righteousness of Christ. And therefore we can't without the most absurd Violence, suppose any other than that he is still speak in; of the same <HI>Justification.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the universal Expression used in the 18th v. <HI>By the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon ALL MEN to Justification of Life;</HI> 'tis needless here to go into the Controversy between the <HI>Remonstrants</HI> and <HI>Anti-remonstrants,</HI> concerning universal Redemption, and their different Interpretations of this Place. If we take the Words even as the <HI>Arminians</HI> do; yet, in their Sense
<PB N="258" REF="008118_0278_0F6B583B97DBF0D0"/>
of them, the free Gift comes on all Men to Justification only <HI>Conditionally,</HI> i. e. <HI>provided</HI> they believe, repent, &amp;c. But in our Author's Sense, it <HI>actually</HI> comes on all, whe∣ther they believe and repent, or not; which certainly can't be infer'd from the universal Expression, as here used. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself supposes, the main Design of the Apostle in this universal Phrase, <HI>All Men,</HI> is to signify, that the Be∣nefits of Christ shall come on <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as well as <HI>Jews.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 60, 61. See also Contents of this Paragraph, in his Notes on the Epistle.</NOTE> And he supposes, that <HI>the Many,</HI> and <HI>the All,</HI> here signify the same: But 'tis quite certain, that all the Benefits here spoken of, which the Apostle says are to <HI>the many,</HI> don't actually come upon all Mankind; as particularly the <HI>abounding of Grace,</HI> spoken of v. 18th. <HI>The Grace of God, and the Gift by Grace, hath abounded unto the many,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>This abounding of Grace our Author explains thus; <Q>The rich Overplus of Grace, in erecting a new Dispen∣sation, furnished with a glorious Fund of Light, Means and Motives.</Q> But will any pretend, that all Mankind have actually been Partakers of this new Fund of Light,&amp;c? How were the many Millions of <HI>Indians,</HI> on the <HI>Ameri∣can</HI> Side of the Globe, Partakers of it, before the <HI>Euro∣peans</HI> came hither? Yea, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself supposes, all that is meant, is, that it is <HI>free for all that are willing to accept of it.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE> The Agreement between <HI>Adam</HI> as the Type or Figure of him that was to come, and Christ as the Antitype, appears as full and clear, if we suppose, ALL which are IN CHRIST (to use the common Scripture∣Phrase) have the Benefit of his Obedience, as ALL that are IN ADAM have the sorrowful Fruit of his Disobedience. The Scripture speaks of Believers as the Seed or Posterity of Christ. (<HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 29.)

And the same which the Apostle had spoken of in the preceed∣ing Chapter, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 18. compared with <HI>Gen.</HI> xv. 5.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> much insists on that Place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 21, 22. <HI>For since by Man came Death, by Man came also the Resurrection of the Dead: For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive;</HI> to confirm his Suppo∣sitions, that the Apostle here in the 5th of <HI>Romans,</HI> speak∣ing of the Death &amp; Condemnation which come by <HI>Adam,</HI> has respect only to the Death <HI>we all die,</HI> when this Life ends: And that by the Justification and Life which come by Christ, he has respect only to the general <HI>Resurrection</HI> at the last Day. But it is observable, that his Argument is wholly built on these two Suppositions, <HI>viz. First,</HI> that the Resurrection meant by the Apostle, in that Place in the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. is the Resurrection of all Mankind, both just and unjust. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Opposite Consequences of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, and Christ's Obedience, spoken of here in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5th, are the very same, neither more nor less, as are spoken of there. But there are no Grounds for sup∣posing either of these things to be true.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no Evidence, that the <HI>Resurrection</HI> there spoken of, is the Resurrection both of the <HI>Just &amp; Unjust;</HI> but abundant Evidence of the contrary. The Resurrection of the Wicked is seldom mention'd in the New Testa∣ment, and rarely included in the Meaning of the Word; it being esteemed not worthy to be called a Rising to Life, being only for a great Increase of the Misery and Dark∣ness of eternal Death: And therefore by the <HI>Resurrection</HI> is most commonly meant a Rising to Life and Happiness; as may be observed in <HI>Matth.</HI> xxii. 30. <HI>Luk.</HI> xx. 35, 36. <HI>Joh.</HI> vi. 39, 40, 54. <HI>Philip.</HI> iii. 11. and other Places. The Saints are called <HI>the Children of the Resurrection,</HI> as
<PB N="260" REF="008118_0280_0F6B583D01944C00"/>
Dr. <HI>T.</HI> observes in his Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 11. And 'tis exceeding evident, that 'tis the Resurrection to Life and Happiness, the Apostle is speaking of in this 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 22. It appears by each of the three foregoing Verses. v. 18. <HI>Then they which are fallen asleep IN CHRIST</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Saints) <HI>are</HI> perished. v 19. <HI>If in this Life only WE</HI> (Christians or Apostles) <HI>have Hope in Christ,</HI> (and have no Resurrection and eternal Life to hope for) <HI>we are of all Men most miserable.</HI>—v.20.<HI>But now is Christ risen from the Dead, and is become the FIRST FRUITS of them that slept.</HI> He is the Forerunner and first Fruits only with respect to them that are his; who are to follow him, and partake with him in the Glory and Happiness of his Resurrection: but He is not the first Fruits of them who shall come forth to the Resurrection of <HI>Damnation.</HI> It also appears by the Verse immediately following. v. 23. <HI>But every Man in his own Order; Christ the first Fruits, and afterwards, they that are Christ's, at his Coming.</HI> The same is plain by what is said in v. 29, 30, 31, &amp; 32; and by all that is said from the 35th v. to the End of the Chapter, for twenty three Verses together: It there ex∣presly appears, that the Apostle is speaking only of a Rising <HI>to Glory,</HI> with a <HI>glorious Body,</HI> as the little Grain that is sown, being quickened, rises a beautiful flourishing Plant. He there speaks of the different Degrees of Glory among them that shall r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, and compares it to the different Degrees of Glory among the celestial Luminaries. The Resurrection which he treats of, is expresly a being <HI>raised in Incorruption, in Glory, in Power, with a spiritual Body,</HI> having <HI>the Image of the second Man,</HI> the spiritual and heavenly <HI>Adam;</HI> a Resurrection, wherein <HI>this corruptible shall put on Incorruption, &amp; this Mortal put on Immortality, and Death be swallowed up in Victory,</HI> and the Saints shall gloriously triumph over that last Enemy.

But Dr.<HI>T.</HI> says▪ <HI>These are never attributed to the Wicked, in Scrip∣ture.</HI>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 28.</NOTE> So that when the Apostle says here, <HI>As in</HI> Adam <HI>all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive;</HI> 'tis as much as if he had said, <HI>As in Adam we all die,</HI> and our Bodies <HI>are sown in Corruption, in Dishonour, and in Weakness; so in Christ we all</HI> (we Christians, whom I have been all along speaking of) <HI>shall be raised in Power, Glory and Incorruption, spiritual and heavenly,</HI> conformed to the second <HI>Adam. For as we have born the Image of the earthy, we shall also bear the Image of the heavenly.</HI>v.49. Which clearly explains and determines his Meaning in v. 21, 22.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no Evidence, that the Benefit by the second <HI>Adam,</HI> spoken of in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5th, is the very same (containing neither more nor less) as the Resurrection spoken of in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. It is no Evidence of it, that the Benefit is opposed to the Death that comes by the first <HI>Adam,</HI> in like Manner in both Places. The Resurrection to eternal Life, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it be not the whole of that Salvation and Happi∣ness which comes by the second <HI>Adam,</HI> yet is it that wherein this Salvation is principally obtained. The Time of the Saints glorious Resurrection is often spoken of as the proper Time of the Saints Salvation, <HI>The Day of their Redemption,</HI> The Time of their <HI>Adoption,</HI> Glory and Re∣compence. (As, in <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 30. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 23. <HI>Luk.</HI> xiv. 14. &amp; xxi. 28. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 1, 9. <HI>Colos.</HI> iii. 4. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> i. 7. <HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 23. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 13. &amp; v. 4. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 2. and other Places.) All that Salvation and Happiness which is given before, is only a Prelibation and Earnest of their great Reward. Well therefore may that consummate Sal∣vation bestowed on them be set in Opposition to the Death and Ruin which comes by the first <HI>Adam,</HI> in like Manner as the whole of their Salvation is opposed to the same in <HI>Rom.</HI> v.—Dr.<HI>T.</HI> himself observes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note</HI> on Rom. viii. 11.</NOTE>, <HI>That the Revival and Resurrection of the Body, is frequently put for our Ad∣vancement to eternal Life.</HI> It being the highest Part, 'tis often put for the Whole.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="008118_0282_0F6B5840F7692A58"/>This Notion, as if the Justification, Righteousness and Life spoken of in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5th, imply'd the Resurrection to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is not only without Ground from Scripture, but contrary to <HI>Reason.</HI> For those Things are there spoken of as great Benefits, by the Grace and free Gift of God: but this is the contrary, in the highest Degree possible, be∣ing the most consummate and infinite Calamity.—To ob∣viate this, our Author supposes the Resurrection of all to be a great Benefit <HI>in it self,</HI> thô turned into a Calamity by the Sin and Folly of obstinate Sinners, who abuse God's Goodness. But the far greater Part of Mankind since <HI>Adam</HI> have never had Opportunity to abu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e this Good∣ness, it having never been made known to them. Men can't abuse a Kindness, which they never had either in Possession, Promise, Offer, or some Intimation: But a Re∣surrection is made known only by divine Revelation; which few comparatively have enjoyed. So that as to such wick∣ed Men as die in Lands of Darkness, if their Resurrection comes at all by Christ, it comes, <HI>from</HI> him and <HI>to</HI> them, only as a Curse, and not as a Blessing; for it never comes to them at all by any <HI>Conveyance, Grant, Promise,</HI> or <HI>Offer,</HI> or any thing by which they can claim it, or know any thing of it, till it comes as an infinite Calamity, past all Remedy.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In a peculiar Manner is there an unreasonable Violence used in our Author's Explanation of the Words <HI>Sinners</HI> and <HI>sinned,</HI> in the Paragraph before us. He says, <Q>These Words, <HI>By one Man's Disobedience, many were made Sinners,</HI> mean neither more nor less, than that by one Man's Disobedience the Many were made subject to Death, by the judicial Act of God.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 30.</NOTE> And he says in the same Place, <Q>By Death, most certainly, is meant no other than the Death &amp; Mortality common to all Mankind.</Q> And those Words, v. 12. <HI>For that all have sinned,</HI> he thus explains, <Q>All Men became <HI>Sinners,</HI> as all Mankind are brought into a State of Suffering.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 54. and elsewhere.</NOTE> Here I observe,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="263" REF="008118_0283_0F6B5841B409ABA8"/>1. The main Thing, by which he justifies such Inter∣pretations, is, that <HI>Sin,</HI> in various Instances, is used for <HI>Suffering,</HI> in the old Testament. To which I reply▪ Tho' it be true, that the Word <HI>Chattaah,</HI> signifies both Sin, and a Sin-offering; and this, and some other <HI>Hebrew</HI> Words, which signify Sin, Iniquity, &amp; Wickedness, are some∣times put for the Effect or Punishment of Iniquity, by a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tonymy of the Cause for the Effect; yet it does not ap∣pear, that these Words are ever used for enduring Suffer∣ing, where the Suffering is not spoken of under any Notion of a Punishment of Sin, or a Fruit of God's Anger for Sin, or of any Imputation of Guilt, or under any Notion of Sin's being at all laid to the Charge of the Sufferer, or the Suffering's being at all of the Nature of any Recom∣pence, Compensation or Satisfaction for Sin. And there∣fore none of the Instances he mentions, come up to his Purpose. When <HI>Let</HI> is commanded to leave <HI>Sodom,</HI> that he might not be consumed <HI>in the Iniquity</HI> of the City, meaning, in that Fire, which is the Effect and Punishment of the Iniquity of the City; this is quite <HI>another</HI> Thing, than if that Fire came on the City in general as no Pu∣nishment at all, nor as any Fruit of a Charge of Iniquity on the City, or of God's Displeasure for their Sin, but as a Token of God's Favour to the Inhabitants; Which is what is supposed with respect to the Death of Mankind; it being introduced only as a Benefit, on the Foot of a Co∣venant of Grace. And especially is this quite another Thing, than if, in the Expression used, the Iniquity had been ascribed to <HI>Lot;</HI> and God, instead of saying, Lest thou be consumed in <HI>the Iniquity of the City,</HI> had said, Lest thou be consumed <HI>in thine Iniquity,</HI> or, Lest <HI>thou Sin,</HI> or <HI>be made a Sinner.</HI> Whereas, the Expression is such as does expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly remove the Iniquity, spoken of, from <HI>Lot,</HI> and fix it on ano∣ther Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> the City. The Place cited by our Au∣thor, in <HI>Jer.</HI> li.—is exactly Parallel. And as to what <HI>Abi∣meleck</HI> says to <HI>Abraham, What have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me, and on my Kingdom, a great</HI> Sin? 'Tis manifest, <HI>Abimeleck</HI> was afraid, that God was angry,
<PB N="264" REF="008118_0284_0F6B58424EFE5930"/>
for what he had done to <HI>Sarah</HI> or; would have been angry with him, if he had done what he was about to do, as im∣puting <HI>Sin</HI> to him for it: which is a quite different Thing from calling some Calamity, <HI>Sin,</HI> under no Notion of it's being any Punishment of Sin, nor in the least Degree from God's Displeasure. And so with regard to every Place our Author cites in the Margin, 'tis plain, that what is meant in each of them, is <HI>the Punishment of</HI> Sin, and not some Suffering which is no Punishment at all. And as to the Instances he mentions in his <HI>Supplement,</HI> P. 184. the Two that look most favourable to his Design, are those in <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxi. 39. &amp; 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> vii. 9.—With respect to the for∣mer, where <HI>Jacob</HI> says, <HI>That which was torn of Beasts,</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ochi a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hattenah—Which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> is pleased to translate, <HI>I was the Sinner:</HI> but is properly render'd, <HI>I expiated it;</HI> the Verb in <HI>Pihel</HI> properly signifying to <HI>expiate.</HI> And the plain Meaning is <HI>I bore the Blame of it, and was obliged to pay for it,</HI> as being supposed to be lost thrô my Fault or Neglect. Which is a quite different Thing from Suffering without any Supposition of Fault. And as to the latter Place, where the Lepers say, <HI>This Day is a Day of good Tidings, and we hold our Peace: If we tarry till Morning some Mischief will befal us.</HI> In the Hebrew, <HI>Umetzaanu gnaon;</HI>—<HI>Iniquity will find us,</HI> that is, Some Punishment of our Fault will come upon us. Elsewhere such Phrases are used, as, <HI>Your Iniquity will find you out,</HI> and the like. But certainly this is a different Thing from suffering without Fault, or Supposition of Fault. And it does not appear, that the Verb in Hiphil, <HI>Hirshiang,</HI> is ever put for <HI>condemn</HI> in any other Sense than condemning for Sin, or Guilt, or supposed Guilt, belonging to the Subject condemned. This Word is used, in the Participle of Hiphil, to signify <HI>condemning,</HI> in <HI>Prov.</HI> xvii. 15. <HI>He that justifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Just, even both are an Abomination to the Lord.</HI> This Dr. <HI>T.</HI> observes, as if it were to his Purpose, when he is endeavouring to shew, that in this Place in the 5th of <HI>Romans,</HI> the Apostle speaks of God Himself as <HI>condemning the just,</HI> or per∣fectly

Nor is any Instance produced, wherein the Verb, <HI>Sin,</HI> which is used by the Apostle when he says, <HI>All have sinned,</HI> is any where used in our Author's Sense, for being brought into a State of Suffering, and that not as a Punishment for Sin, or as any Thing arising from God's Displeasure; much less for being the Subject of what comes only as the Fruit of divine Love, and as a Favour of the HIGHEST NA∣TURE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 303.</NOTE> Nor can any thing like this Sense of the Verb be found in the whole Bible.</P>
<P N="2">2. If there had been any thing like such an Use of the Words, <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Sinner,</HI> as our Author supposes, in the old Testament, 'tis evident that such as Use of them is quite aliene from the Language of the <HI>New Testament.</HI> Where can an Instance be produced, of any thing like it, in any one Place, besides what is pretended in this? And particularly, Where else shall we find these Words &amp; Phrases used in such a Sense, in any of this Apostle's Writings? We have enough of his Writings, by which to learn his Lan∣guage and Way of speaking about <HI>Sin, Condemnation, Punishment, Death</HI> and <HI>Suffering.</HI> He wrote much more of the New Testament, than any other Person. He very often has Occasion to speak of <HI>Condemnation;</HI> but where does he express it by <HI>being made Sinners?</HI> Especially how far is he elsewhere from using such a Phrase, to signify a being condemned without Guilt, or any Imputation or Supposition of Guilt, or Atonement for Guilt? Vastly more still is it remote from his Language, so to use the Verb <HI>Sin,</HI> and to say, Man <HI>sinneth,</HI> or <HI>has sinned,</HI> tho' hereby meaning Nothing more nor less, than that he, by a <HI>judicial Act,</HI> is <HI>condemned,</HI> on the Foot of a Dispensation of <HI>Grace,</HI> to receive a <HI>great Favour!</HI> He abundantly uses the Words, <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Sinner;</HI> his Writings are full of such Terms: but where else does he use them in such a Sense? He has much Occasion in his Epistles to speak of <HI>Death,</HI> temporal and eternal; He has much Occasion to speak of

<HI>Suffering,</HI> of all Kinds, in this World, and the World to come: But where does he call those things <HI>Sin?</HI> and de∣nominate innocent Men <HI>Sinners?</HI> or say, They have <HI>sinned,</HI> meaning that they are brought into a State of Suffering? If the Apostle, because he was a <HI>Jew,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o addic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Idiom, as thus is one Paragraph to repeat this particular <HI>Hebraism,</HI> which, at most, it compa∣ratively rare even in the old Testament, 'tis strange that never any thing like it should appear any where else in his Writings; and especially that he should never fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l into such a Way of speaking in his Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> written to <HI>Jews</HI> only, who were most used to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Idiom. And why does <HI>Christ</HI> never use such Language in any of his Speeches, tho' he was born and brought up amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> and delivered almost all his Speeches only to <HI>Jews?</HI>—And why do none of the rest of the Writers of the New Testament ever use it, who were all born and educated <HI>Jews</HI> (at least all excepting <HI>Luke</HI>) and some of them wrote especially for the Benefit of the <HI>Jews?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis worthy to be observed, what Liberty is taken, and Boldness used with this Apostle; such Words as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and Words of the same Root &amp; Signification, are Words abundantly used by him elsewhere in this and other Epistles, and also when speaking, as he is here, of Christ's Redemption &amp; Atone∣ment, and of the general Sinfulness of Mankind, and of the Condemnation of Sinners, &amp; of Justification by Christ, and of Death as the Consequence of Sin, and of Life and Restoration to Life by Christ, as here; yet no where are any of these Words used, but in a Sense very remote from what is supposed here. However, in this Place these Terms must have a <HI>distinguished singular</HI> Sense found out for them, and annexed to 'em! A <HI>new</HI> Language must be coin'd for the Apostle, which he is evidently quite unused to, and put into his Mouth on this Occasion, for the sake of evading this clear, precise and abundant Testimony of his, to the Doctrine of original Sin.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="267" REF="008118_0287_0F6B584480098198"/>3. The putting such a Sense on the Word, <HI>Sin,</HI> in this Place, is not only to make the Apostle greatly to disagree with himself in the Language he uses every where else, but also to disagree with himself no less in the Language he uses in this very Passage. He often here used the Word <HI>Sin,</HI> and other Words plainly of the same Design and Im∣port, such as <HI>Transgression, Disobedience, Offence.</HI> No∣thing can be more evident, than that these are here used as several Names of the same Thing; for they are used in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly, and put one for another; as will be manifest only on the Cast of an Eye on the Place. And these Words are used no less than seventeen Times in this one Para∣graph. Perhaps we shall find no Place in the whole Bible, in which the Word, <HI>Sin,</HI> and other Words synonymous, are used so often in so little Compass: and in all the Instances, in the proper Sense, as signifying <HI>moral Evil,</HI> and even so understood by Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself (as appears by his own Exposition) but only in these two Places; where in the Midst of all, to evade a clear Evidence of the Doctrine of Original Sin, another Meaning must be found out, and it must be supposed that the Apostle uses the Word in a Sense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>irely different, signifying something that neither <HI>implies</HI> nor <HI>supposes</HI> any moral Evil at all in the Subject.</P>
<P>Here 'tis very remarkable, the Gentleman who so greatly insisted upon it, that the Word, <HI>Death,</HI> must needs be un∣derstood in the <HI>same</HI> Sense throughout this Paragraph; yea, that it is <HI>evidently, clearly</HI> and <HI>infallibly</HI> so, in as much as the Apostle is still discoursing on the same Subject; yet can, without the least Difficulty, suppose the Word, <HI>Sin,</HI> to be used so differently in the very same Passage, wherein the Apostle is discoursing on the same Thing. Let us take that one Instance in v. 12. <HI>Wherefore as by one Man SIN enter'd into the World, and Death by SIN, and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have SIN∣NED.</HI> Here, by <HI>Sin,</HI> implied in the Word, <HI>sinned,</HI> in the End of the Sentence, our Author understands something perfectly and altogether <HI>diverse</HI> from what is meant by the Word <HI>Sin,</HI> not only in the same Discourse, on the same
<PB N="268" REF="008118_0288_0F6B584542431A00"/>
Subject, but twice in the former Part of the very same Sen∣tence, of which this latter Part is not only the Conclusion, but the Explication: And also intirely <HI>different</HI> from the the Use of the Word twice in the next Sentence, wherein the Apostle is still most plainly discoursing on the same Sub∣ject, as is not denied: And in the next Sentence to that (v. 14.) the Apostle uses the very same Verb, <HI>sinned,</HI> and as signi∣fying the committing of moral Evil, as our Author himself understands it. Afterwards (v. 19.) the Apostle uses the Word, <HI>Sinners,</HI> which our Author supposes to be in some∣what of a different Sense still. So that here is the utmost Violence, of the Kind, that can be conceived of, to make out a Scheme, against the plainest Evidence, in changing the Meaning of a Word, backward and forward, in one Para∣graph, all about one Thing, and in different Parts of the same Sentences, coming over and over in quick-Repetitions, with a Variety of other synonymous Words to fix it's Sig∣nification; Besides the continued Use of the Word in the former Part of this Chapter, and in all the preceeding Part of this Epistle, and the continued Use of it in the next Chapter, and in the next to that, and the 8th Chapter fol∣lowing that, and to the End of the Epistle; in none of which Places is it pretended, but that the Word is used in the proper Sense, by our Author in his Paraphrase and Notes on the whole Epistle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable to this Manner, our Author in explaining the 7th Chap. of <HI>Romans,</HI> understands the Pronoun, I, or <HI>Me,</HI> used by the Apostle in that one continued Discourse, in no less than <HI>Six</HI> different Senses. He takes it in the 1st <HI>ver.</HI> to signify the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> himself. In the &amp; 9, 10, &amp; 11th Verses, for the People of the <HI>Jews,</HI> thro' all Ages, both before &amp; after <HI>Moses,</HI> especially the carnal ungodly Part of 'em. In the 13th <HI>ver.</HI> for an objecting <HI>Jew,</HI> entring into a Dialogue with the Apostle. In the 15, 16, 17, 20th, and latter Part of the 25th <HI>ver.</HI> it is understood in two different Senses, for two <HI>I'</HI>s in the same Person; one, a Man's Reason; and the other, his Passions &amp; carnal Appetites. And in the 7th &amp; former Part of the last Verse, for Us Christians in general; or, for all that enjoy the Word of God, the Law and the Gospel. And these different Senses, the most of 'em, strangely inter∣mixed and interchanged, backwards and forwards.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="008118_0289_0F6B584609575B80"/>But indeed we need go no further than that one v. 12. What the Apostle means by <HI>Sin,</HI> in the latter Part of the Verse, is evident with the utmost Plainness, by comparing it with the former Part; one Part answering to another, and the last Clause exegetical of the former. <HI>Wherefore, as by one Man Sin enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that</HI> (or, unto which) <HI>all have sinned.</HI> Here <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> are spoken of in the former Part, &amp; <HI>Sin</HI> &amp; <HI>Death</HI> are spoken of in the latter Part; the two Parts of the Sentence so answering one another, that the same Things are apparently meant by <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> in both Parts.</P>
<P>And besides to interpret <HI>sinning,</HI> here, of falling under the Suffering of <HI>Death,</HI> is yet the more violent &amp; unrea∣sonable, because the Apostle in this very Place does once and again <HI>distinguish</HI> between <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death;</HI> plainly speaking of one as the Effect, and the other the Cause. So in the 21st v. <HI>That as</HI> Sin <HI>hath reigned unto</HI> Death; and in the 12th v. Sin <HI>enter'd into the World, and</HI> Death <HI>BY</HI> Sin. And this plain Distinction holds thrô all the Discourse, as between <HI>Death</HI> and the <HI>Offence,</HI> v. 15. and v. 17. and between the <HI>Offence</HI> and <HI>Condemnation,</HI>v. 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thô we should omit the Consideration of the Manner in which the Apostle uses the Words, <HI>Sin, sinned,</HI> &amp;c. in other Places, and in other Parts of this Discourse, yet Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Interpretation of 'em would be very absurd.</P>
<P>The Case stands thus:—According to <HI>his</HI> Exposition, we are said to have <HI>sinned,</HI> by an <HI>active</HI> Verb, as tho' we had actively sinned; yet this is not spoken truly and properly, but it is put figuratively for our becoming Sinners <HI>passively,</HI> our being <HI>made</HI> or <HI>constituted</HI> Sinners. Yet again, not that we do truly become Sinners <HI>passively,</HI> or are really <HI>made Sinners,</HI> by any thing that God does; this also is only a figurative or tropical Representation: And the Meaning is only, we are <HI>condemned,</HI> and treated <HI>AS IF</HI> we were <HI>Sinners.</HI> Not indeed that we are properly <HI>condemned;</HI> for God never truly condemns the Innocent: But this also is only a figurative Representation of the Thing. It is
<PB N="270" REF="008118_0290_0F6B5846E8E72930"/>
but <HI>as it were</HI> condemning; because it is appointing to <HI>Death,</HI> a terrible Evil, <HI>as if it were</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Punishment. But then, in Reality, here is no Appointment to a terrible <HI>Evil,</HI> or any Evil at all; but truly to a <HI>Benefit,</HI> a <HI>great</HI> Benefit: And so, in representing Death as a Punishment, or Calamity condemned to, another Figure or Trope is made use of, and an exceeding bold one; for, as we are appointed to it, it is so far from being an Evil or Punishment, that it is really a <HI>Favour,</HI> and that of the highest Nature, appointed by meer Grace &amp; Love; tho' <HI>it seems</HI> to be a Calamity.—Thus we have Tropes and Figures multiplied, one upon the back of another; and all in that one Word, <HI>sinned;</HI> according to the Manner, as it is supposed, the Apostle uses it. We have a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gurative Representation,</HI> not of a Reality, but of a <HI>figurative Representation.</HI> Neither is this a Re∣presentation of a Reality, but of another Thing that still is but a <HI>figurative Representation</HI> of something else: Yea, even this <HI>something else</HI> is still but a <HI>Figure,</HI> and one that is very harsh and far-fetch'd. So that here we have a <HI>Figure</HI> to represent a <HI>Figure,</HI> even a <HI>Figure</HI> of a <HI>Figure</HI> representing some very remote <HI>Figure,</HI> which most obscure∣ly represents the Thing intended; if the most <HI>terrible Evil</HI> can indeed be said at all to <HI>represent</HI> the contrary <HI>Good,</HI> of the highest Kind.—And now, what cannot be made of any Place of Scripture, in such a Way of ma∣naging it, as this? And is there any Hope of ever deciding any Controversy by the Scripture, in the Way of using such a Licence with the Scripture, in order to force it to a Compliance with our own Schemes? If the Apostle in∣deed uses Language after so strange a Manner in this Place, 'tis perhaps such an Instance, as not only there is not the like of it in all the Bible besides, but perhaps in no Writing whatsoever.—And this, not in any parabolical, vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionary, or prophetic Description, in which difficult and obscure Representations are wont to be made Use of; nor in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dramatic or poetical Representation, in which a great Li∣cence is often taken, and bold Figures are commonly to be expected: But 'tis in a familiar Letter, wherein the

Apostle is delivering Gospel-Instruction, as a Minister of the New-Testament; and wherein, as he professes, he delivers divine Truth without the Vail of antient Figures and Si∣militudes, and uses great Plainness of Speech. And in a Discourse that is wholly didactic, narrative and arg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>menta∣tive; evidently setting himself to explain the Doctrine he is upon, in the Reason and Nature of it, with a great Va∣riety of Expressions, turning it as it were on every Side, to make his Meaning plain, and to fix in his Readers the exact Notion of what he intends.—Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself ob∣serves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f. to Paraph. on <HI>Rom.</HI></NOTE> <Q>This Apostle takes great Care to guard and explain every Part of his Subject: and I may venture to say, he has left no Part of it unexplained, or un∣guarded. Never was an Author more exact &amp; cautious in this, than be.

Nay, I scarcely know another Instance equal to this, of the Apostle's Care to be well understood, by being very par∣ticular, explicit and precise, setting the Matter forth in every Light, going over and over again with his Doctrine, clearly to exhibit, and fully to settle and determine the Thing which he aims at.</P>

<HEAD>Some Observations on the Connection, Scope and Sense of this remarkable Paragraph in Rom. v.—With some Reflections on the Evidence, which we here have of the Doctrine of Original Sin.</HEAD>
<P>THE Connection of this remarkable Paragraph with the foregoing Discourse in this Epistle, is not ob∣scure and difficult; nor to be sought for at a Distance. It may be plainly seen, only by a general Glance on Things which went before, from the Beginning of the
<PB N="272" REF="008118_0292_0F6B58489E48A3C8"/>
Epistle: And indeed what is said immediately before in the same Chapter, leads directly to it. The Apostle in the preceeding Part of this Epistle had largely treated of the <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> of all Mankind, <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as <HI>Gentiles.</HI> He had particularly spoken of the Depra∣vity and Ruin of Mankind in their natural State, in the foregoing Part of this <HI>Chapter;</HI> representing them as be∣ing <HI>Sinners, Ungodly, Enemies,</HI> exposed to divine <HI>Wrath,</HI> and <HI>without Strength.</HI>—No Wonder now, this leads him to observe, <HI>how</HI> this so great &amp; deplorable an Event came to pass; <HI>how</HI> this universal Sin and Ruin came into the World. And with Regard to the <HI>Jews</HI> in particular, who, thô they might allow the Doctrine of original Sin in their own Profession, yet were strongly prejudiced against what was implied in it, or evidently following from it, with re∣gard to themselves; in this respect they were prejudiced against the Doctrine of universal Sinfulness, and Exposed∣ness to Wrath by Nature, looking on themselves as by Nature holy and Favourites of God, because they were the Children of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and with them the Apostle had laboured most in the foregoing Part of the Epistle, to convince them of their being by Nature as sinful, and as much the Children of Wrath, as the <HI>Gentiles:</HI>—I say, with Regard to them, it was exceeding proper, and what the Apostle's Design most naturally led him to, to take off their Eyes from their Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> who was their Father in Distinction from other Nations. and direct them to their Father <HI>Adam,</HI> who was the common Father of Mankind, and equally of <HI>Jews</HI> and Gentiles. And when he was enter'd on this Doctrine of the Derivation of Sin and Ruin, or Death, to all Mankind from <HI>Adam,</HI> no Wonder if he thought it needful to be somewhat particu∣lar in it, seeing he wrote to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> the for∣mer of which had been brought up under the Prejudices of a proud Opinion of themselves, as a holy People by Nature, and the latter had been educated in total Igno∣rance of all Things of this Kind.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="008118_0293_0F6B5849AD35AB60"/>Again, the Apostle had from the Beginning of the E∣pistle been endeavouring to evince the absolute Depen∣dence of all Mankind on the free <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> for Salvation, and the Greatness of this Grace; and particu∣larly in the former Part of this Chapter. The Greatness of this Grace he shews especially by two Things. (1) The universal Corruption and Misery of Mankind; as in all the foregoing Chapters, and in the 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 10 Verses of this Chapter.—(2.) The Greatness of the Benefits which Believers receive, and the Greatness of the Glory they have Hope of. So especially in <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp; 11th of this Chapter. And here, in this Place we are upon, from <HI>ver.</HI> 12, to the End, he is still on the same Design of mag∣nifying the Grace of God, in the same Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fa∣vour, Life and Happiness which Believers in Christ re∣ceive; speaking here of <HI>the Grace of God, the Gift by Grace, the Abounding of Grace,</HI> and <HI>the Reign of Grace.</HI> And he still sets forth the Freedom and Riches of Grace by the same two Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI> The universal Sinfulness and Ruin of Mankind, all having sinned, all naturally exposed to Death, Judgment &amp; Condemnation; and the exceeding Greatness of the Benefit received,—being far greater than the Misery which comes by the first <HI>Adam,</HI>&amp; abounding be∣yond it. And 'tis by no Means consistent with the Apostle's Scope, to suppose, that the Benefits which we have by Christ as the Antitype of <HI>Adam,</HI> here mainly insisted on, is without any Grace at all, being only a Restoration to Life, of such as never deserved Death.</P>
<P>Another Thing observable in the Apostle's Scope from the Beginning of the Epistle, is, he endeavours to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew the Greatness and Absoluteness of the Dependence of all Mankind on the <HI>Redemption &amp; Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST, for Justification and Life, that he might <HI>magnify &amp; exalt</HI> the <HI>Redeemer:</HI> which Design his whole Heart was swal∣lowed up in, and may be looked upon as the main Design of the whole Epistle. And this is what he had been upon in the preceeding Part of this Chapter; inferring it from the same Argument, the utter Sinfulness and Ruin of
<PB N="274" REF="008118_0294_0F6B5849C7A342E0"/>
all Men. And he is evidently still on the same Thing in this Place, from the 12th v. to the End; speaking of the <HI>same</HI> Justification and Righteousness, which he had dwelt on before; and not another totally diverse. No Wonder, when the Apostle is treating so fully and largely of our Restoration, Righteousness and Life by Christ, that he is led by it to consider our Fall, Sin, Death and Ruin by <HI>Adam;</HI> and to observe wherein these two opposite Heads of Mankind agree, and wherein they differ, in the Manner of Conveyance of opposite Influences and Communications from Each.</P>
<P>Thus, if this Place be understood, as it used to be un∣derstood by orthodox Divines, the whole stands in a natu∣ral, easy and clear Connection with the preceeding Part of the Chapter, and all the former Part of the Epistle; and in a plain Agreement with the express Design of all that the Apostle had been saying; and also in Connection with the Words last before spoken, as introduced by the two immediately preceeding Verses, where he is speaking of our Justification, Reconciliation and Salvation by Christ; which leads the Apostle directly to observe, how, on the contrary, we have Sin and Death by <HI>Adam.</HI> Taking this Discourse of the Apostle in it's true and plain Sense, there is no Need of great Extent of Learning, or Depth of Criticism, to find out the Connection: But if it be un∣derstood in Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Sense, the plain Scope and Con∣nection are wholly lost, and there was truly Need of a Skill in Criticism, and Art of Discerning, beyond, or at least different from that of former Divines, and a Faculty of seeing something afar of, which other Men's Sight could not reach, in order to find out the Connection.</P>
<P>What has been already observed, may suffice to shew the Apostle's general Scope in this Place. But yet there seem to be some <HI>other</HI> Things, which he has his Eye to, in several Expressions; some particular things in the then∣present State, Temper and Notions of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which he also had before spoken of, or had Reference to, in certain Places of the foregoing Part of the Epistle. As particu∣larly,
<PB N="275" REF="008118_0295_0F6B584A80E5EB60"/>
the <HI>Jews</HI> had a very superstitious and extravagant Notion of their Law, deliver'd by <HI>Moses;</HI> as if it were the prime, grand, and indeed only Rule of God's Pro∣ceeding with Mankind, as their Judge, both in Men's Justi∣fication &amp; Condemnation, or from whence all, both Sin and Righteousness, was imputed; and had no Consideration of the Law of Nature, written in the Hearts of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and of all Mankind. Herein they ascribed infinitely too much to their particular Law, beyond the true Design of it. They <HI>made their Boast of the Law;</HI> as if their being distinguished from all other Nations by that great Privi∣lege, <HI>the giving of the Law,</HI> sufficiently made 'em a holy People, and God's Children. This Notion of theirs the Apostle evidently refers to, <HI>Chap.</HI> ii. 13, 17.—19. and indeed thro' that whole Chapter. They looked on the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> as intended to be the only Rule &amp; Means of Justification; and as such, trusted in the Works of the Law, especially Circumcision: which appears by the iiid <HI>Chap∣ter.</HI> But as for the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> they look'd on them as by Nature Sinners, and Children of Wrath; because born of uncircumcised Parents, and Aliens from their Law, and who themselves did not know, profess and submit to the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> become Proselytes, and receive Circumci∣sion. What they esteemed the Sum of <HI>their</HI> Wickedness and Condemnation was, that they did not turn <HI>Jews,</HI> and act as <HI>Jews.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here are worthy to be observed the Things which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself says to the same Purpose, <HI>Key</HI> §. 270, 271. &amp; <HI>Pre∣face to Par. on Epist.</HI> to Rom. §. 43.</NOTE> This Notion of their's the Apostle has a plain Respect to, and endeavours to convince them of the Falseness of, in <HI>Chap.</HI> ii. 12,—16. And he has a manifest Regard again to the same Thing here, in the 12, 13, &amp; 14th Verses of <HI>Chap.</HI> v<HI>th.</HI> Which may lead us the more clearly to see the true Sense of those Verses; about the Sense of which is the main Controversy, &amp; the Mean∣ing of which being determined, it will settle the Meaning of every other controverted Expressions through the whole Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="008118_0296_0F6B584CF3689178"/>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> misrepresents the Apostle's Argument in these Verses. (Which, as has been demonstrated, is in his Sense al∣together vain and impertinent.) He supposes, the Thing which the Apostle mainly intends to prove, is, that <HI>Death</HI> or Mortality don't come on Mankind by <HI>personal</HI> Sin; and that he would prove it by this Medium, that <HI>Death reigned</HI> when there was <HI>no Law</HI> in Being, which threatned personal Sin with Death. 'Tis acknowledged, that this is implied, even that Death came into the World by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin: yet this is not the main thing the Apostle designs to prove. But his main Point evidently is, that <HI>Sin &amp; Guilt</HI> and <HI>just Exposedness to Death and Ruin</HI> came into the World by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin; as <HI>Righteousness, Justification,</HI> and a <HI>Title to eternal Life</HI> come by Christ. Which Point he confirms by this Consideration. That from the very Time when <HI>Adam</HI> sin'd, these Things namely, Sin, Guilt and Desert of Ruin, became <HI>universal</HI> in the World, long before the Law given by <HI>Moses</HI> to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation had any Being.</P>
<P>The Apostle's Remark, that <HI>Sin</HI> entred into the World by <HI>one Man,</HI> who was the Father of the whole human Race, was an Observation which afforded proper Instructi∣on for the <HI>Jews,</HI> who look'd on themselves an holy Peo∣ple, because they had the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and were the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> an holy Father; while they look∣ed on other Nations as by Nature unholy and Sinners, be∣cause they were not <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Children. He leads 'em up to an higher Ancestor than this <HI>Patriarch,</HI> even to <HI>Adam,</HI> who being equally the Father of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> both alike come from a sinful Father; from whom Guilt and Pollution were derived alike to all Mankind. And this the Apostle proves by an Argument, which of all that could possibly be invented, tended the most briefly and directly to convince the <HI>Jews:</HI> even by this Reflection, that Death had come equally on all Mankind from <HI>Adam's</HI> Time, and that the Posterity of <HI>Abraham</HI> were equally subject to it with the rest of the World. This was appa∣rent in <HI>Fact;</HI> a Thing they all knew. And the <HI>Jews</HI> had
<PB N="277" REF="008118_0297_0F6B584DABA0EE18"/>
always been taught, that <HI>Death</HI> (which began in the De∣struction of the Body, and of this present Life) was the proper Punishment of <HI>Sin.</HI> This they were taught in <HI>Moses's</HI> History of <HI>Adam,</HI> and God's first Threatning of Punishment for Sin, and by the constant Doctrine of the Law and the Prophets; as has been already observed.</P>
<P>And the Apostle's Observation, that <HI>Sin was in the World</HI> long before the <HI>Law</HI> was given, and was as <HI>uni∣versal</HI> in the World from the Times of <HI>Adam,</HI> as it had been among the Heathen since the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> this shew'd plainly, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were quite mistaken in their Notion of <HI>their</HI> particular Law; and that the <HI>Law</HI> which is the original and universal Rule of Righteousness and Judgment for all Mankind, was another Law, of far more antient Date, even the Law of Nature; which began as early as the human Nature began, and was established with the first Father of Mankind, and in him with the whole Race: the positive Precept of abstaining from the for∣bidden Fruit, being given for the Trial of his Compliance with this Law of Nature; of which the main Rule is su∣pream Regard to God and his Will. And the Apostle proves that it must be thus, because, if the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> had been the highest Rule of Judgment, and if there had not been a superior, prior, divine Rule established, Man∣kind in general would not have been judged &amp; condemned as Sinners, <HI>before</HI> that was given (for "Sin is not imputed, when there is no Law") as it is apparent in Fact they were, because <HI>Death reigned</HI> before that Time, even from the Times of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>It may be observed, the Apostle in this Epistle, &amp; that to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> endeavours to convince the <HI>Jews</HI> of these two Things, in Opposition to the Notions and Pre∣judices they had entertain'd concerning <HI>their Law.</HI> (1.) That it never was intended to be the <HI>Covenant,</HI> or Method by which they should actually be <HI>justified.</HI> (2.) That it was not the <HI>highest</HI> and <HI>universal</HI> Rule or Law, by which Mankind in general, and particularly the heathen World, were <HI>condemned.</HI> And he proves both by similar Argu∣ments.
<PB N="278" REF="008118_0298_0F6B584E4758BCC0"/>
—He proves, that the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was not the <HI>Covenant,</HI> by which any of Mankind were to obtain <HI>Justi∣fication,</HI> because that Covenant was of older Date, being expresly established in the Time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> himself was <HI>justified</HI> by it. This Argument the A∣postle particularly handles in the iiid Chap. of <HI>Galatians,</HI> especially in v. 17, 18, 19. And this Argument is also made Use of in the Apostle'sReasonings in the ivth Chap. of this Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> especially v. 13, 14, 15.—He proves also, that the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was not the <HI>prime</HI> Rule of Judgment, by which Mankind in general, &amp; par∣ticularly the heathen World, were <HI>condemned.</HI> And this he proves also the same Way, <HI>viz.</HI> by shewing this to be of <HI>older Date</HI> than that Law, and that it was established with <HI>Adam.</HI>—Now, these things tended to lead the <HI>Jews</HI> to right Notions of their Law, not as the intended Method of <HI>Justification,</HI> nor as the original and universal Rule of <HI>Condemnation,</HI> but something <HI>superadded</HI> to both: both being of older Date. Superadded to the <HI>latter,</HI> to illustrate and confirm it, that the <HI>Offence might abound;</HI> and super∣added to the former, to be as a <HI>School-Master,</HI> to prepare Men for the Benefits of it, and to magnify divine <HI>Grace</HI> in it, that this might <HI>much more abound.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Occasion of the Obscurity and Difficulty, which seems to attend the Scope and Connexion of the various Clauses in the three first Verses of this Discourse, particularly the 13th &amp; 14th Verses, is, that there are <HI>two</HI> Things (althô Things closely connected) which the Apo∣stle has in his Eye <HI>at once,</HI> in which he aims to enlighten them he writes to; which will not be thought at all strange, by them that have been conversant with, and have attended to this Apostle's Writings. He would illustrate the grand Point he had been upon from the Beginning, even <HI>Justification thro' Christ's Righteousness alone,</HI> by shew∣ing how we are originally in a sinful miserable State, and how we derive this Sin and Misery from <HI>Adam,</HI> and how we are delivered &amp; justified by Christ as a second <HI>Adam.</HI>—At the same Time, he would confute those fosolish and
<PB N="279" REF="008118_0299_0F6B584F5973F5F0"/>
corrupt Notions of the <HI>Jews,</HI> about their <HI>Nation</HI> and their <HI>Law,</HI> that were very inconsistent with these Doctrines.—And he here endeavours to establish, at once, these two Things in Opposition to those <HI>Jewish</HI> Notions:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That 'tis our natural Relation to <HI>Adam,</HI> and not to <HI>Abraham,</HI> which determines our native moral State; and that therefore the being natural Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> will not make us by Nature holy in the Sight of God, since we are the natural Seed of sinful <HI>Adam:</HI> Nor does the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being not descended from <HI>Abraham,</HI> deno∣minate them <HI>Sinners,</HI> any more than the <HI>Jews,</HI> seeing both alike are descended from <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P N="2"> (2.) That the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> is not the prime and gene∣ral Law and Rule of Judgment for Mankind, to <HI>condemn</HI> them, and denominate them <HI>Sinners;</HI> but that the State they are in with regard to a higher, more antient and uni∣versal Law, determines Mankind in general to be <HI>Sinners</HI> in the Sight of God, and liable to be <HI>condemned</HI> as such. Which Observation is, in many Respects, to the Apostle's Purpose; particularly in this Respect, that if the <HI>Jews</HI> were convinced, that the Law which was the prime Rule of <HI>Condemnation,</HI> was given to <HI>all,</HI> was common to all Man∣kind, and that all fell under Condemnation thrô the Vio∣lation of that Law by the common Father of all, both <HI>Jews &amp; Gentiles,</HI> then they would be led more easily and naturally to believe, that the Method of <HI>Justification,</HI> which God had established, also extended equally to <HI>all</HI> Mankind: And that the <HI>Messiah,</HI> by whom we have this Justification, is appointed, as <HI>Adam</HI> was, for a common Head to all, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle's aiming to confute the <HI>Jewish</HI> Notion, is the principal Occasion of those Words in the 13th v. <HI>For until the Law, Sin was in the World; but Sin is not imputed, when there is no Law.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Import of that Expression, <HI>Even over them that had not sinned after the Similitude of</HI> Adam's <HI>Trans∣gression,</HI> not only is the Thing signified by it, in Dr.<HI>T—r'</HI>s Sense of it, <HI>not true;</HI> or if it had been true, would have
<PB N="280" REF="008118_0300_0F6B584FC376CF70"/>
been impertinent, as has been shewn: But his Interp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣tation is, otherwise, very much <HI>strain'd</HI> &amp; unnatural. Ac∣cording to him, by "sinning after the Similitude of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Transgression," is not meant any Similitude of the Act of sinning, nor of the Command sinned against, nor properly any Circumstance of the <HI>Sin;</HI> but only the Similitude of a Circumstance of the <HI>Command,</HI> viz. the <HI>Threatning</HI> it is attended with. A far-fetch'd Thing, to be called a <HI>Si∣militude of sinning!</HI> Besides, this Expression, in such a Meaning, is only a needless, impertinent, and aukward <HI>Repeating</HI> over again the same Thing, which, it is supposed, the Apostle had observed in the foregoing Verse, even after he had left it, &amp; had proceeded another Step in the Series of his Discourse, or Chain of Arguing. As thus, in the foregoing Verse, the Apostle had plainly laid down his Argument (as our Author understands it) by which he would prove, <HI>Death</HI> did not come by <HI>personal</HI>Sin <HI>viz.</HI> that Death reigned before any <HI>Law, threatning</HI> Death for per∣sonal Sin, was in Being; so that the Sin th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n committed was against <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law,</HI> threatning Death for personal Sin. Having laid this down, the Apostle leaves this Part of his Argument, &amp; proceeds another Step, <HI>Nevertheless Death reigned from</HI> Adam <HI>to</HI> Moses: And then returns, in a strange, unnatural Manner, and <HI>repeats</HI> that Argument or Assertion again, but only more ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curely than before, in these Words, <HI>Even over them that had not sinned after the Similitude of</HI> Adam's <HI>Transgression,</HI> i. e. over them that had not sinned against a Law threatning Death for personal Sin. Which is just the same Thing, as if the Apostle had said, <Q>They that sin'd <HI>before the Law,</HI> did not sin against a Law threatning Death for personal Sin; for there was <HI>no such Law,</HI> for any to sin against, at that Time: <HI>Nevertheless</HI> Death reigned at that Time, <HI>even over such as did not sin</HI> against a Law threatning Death for personal Sin.</Q>—Which latter Clause <HI>adds</HI> Nothing to the Premises, and tends Nothing to illustrate what was said before, but rather to obscure and darken it. The Particle (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>even,</HI> when prefix'd in this Manner, used to
<PB N="281" REF="008118_0301_0F6B585080EC09C8"/>
signify something additional, some Advance in the Sense or Argument; implying, that the Words following express something more, or express the same thing more fully, plainly, or forcibly. But to unite two Clauses by such a Particle, in such a Manner, when there is Nothing besides a flat Repetition, with no superadded Sense or Force, but rather a greater Uncertainty and Obscurity, would be very unusual, and indeed very absurd.</P>
<P>I can see no Reason, why we should be dissatisfied with that Explanation of this Clause, which has more commonly been given, <HI>viz.</HI> That by <HI>them who have not sinned after the Similitude of</HI> Adam's <HI>Transgression,</HI> are meant <HI>Infants;</HI> who, tho' they have indeed sinned in <HI>Adam,</HI> yet never sinned as <HI>Adam</HI> did, by actually transgressing in their own Persons; unless it be, that this Interpretation is too <HI>old,</HI> and too <HI>common.</HI> It was well known by those the Apostle wrote to, that vast Numbers had <HI>died</HI> in Infancy, with∣in that Period which the Apostle speaks of, particularly in the Time of the Deluge: And it would be strange, the Apostle should not have the Case of such Infants in his Mind; even supposing, his Scope were what our Author supposes, and he had only intended to prove that Death did not come on Mankind for their personal Sin. How directly would it have served the Purpose of proving this, to have mention'd so great a Part of Mankind, that are subject to Death, who, all know, never committed any Sin <HI>in their own Persons?</HI> How much more plain and easy the Proof of the Point by that, than to go round about, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes, and bring in a Thing so dark and uncer∣tain, as this, That God never would bring Death on all Mankind for <HI>personal</HI> Sin (tho' they had personal Sin) without an express revealed <HI>Constitution;</HI> and then to ob∣serve▪ that there was <HI>no</HI> revealed Constitution of this Na∣ture from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses;</HI> which also seems a Thing without any plain Evidence; and then to infer, that it must needs be so, that it could come only on <HI>Occasion</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, though not <HI>for</HI> his Sin, or as any Punishment of it; which Inference also is very dark &amp; unintelligible.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="008118_0302_0F6B585143FC89D0"/>If the Apostle in this Place meant those who never sinned by their personal Act, it is not strange that he should ex∣press this by their <HI>not sinning after the Similitude of</HI> Adam's <HI>Transgression.</HI> We read of two Ways of Men's being like <HI>Adam,</HI> or in which a Similitude to him is ascribed to Men: One is a being begotten or born in his <HI>Image</HI> or <HI>Likeness,</HI> Gen. v. 3. Another is a transgressing God's Covenant or Law, <HI>like him,</HI> Hos. vi. 7. <HI>They, like</HI> Adam [so, in the <HI>Heb.</HI> &amp; <HI>Vulg. Lat.</HI>] <HI>have transgressed the Covenant.</HI> Infants have the former Similitude; but not the latter. And it was very natural, when the Apostle would infer, that Infants become Sinners by that one Act &amp; Offence of <HI>Adam,</HI> to observe, that they had not renewed the Act of Sin themselves, by any second Instance of a like Sort. And such might be the State of Language among <HI>Jews</HI> and Christians at that Day, that the Apostle might have no Phrase more aptly to express this Meaning. The Manner in which the Epithets, <HI>Personal</HI> and <HI>Actual,</HI> are used and applied now in this Case, is probably of later Date and more modern Use.</P>
<P>And then this Supposition of the Apostle's having the Case of Infants in View, in this Expression, makes it more to his Purpose, to mention Death Reigning before the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was given. For the <HI>Jews</HI> look'd on all Nati∣ons, besides themselves, as <HI>Sinners,</HI> by Virtue of <HI>their Law;</HI> being made so especially by the <HI>Law of Circumcision,</HI> given first to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and compleated by <HI>Moses,</HI> making the Want of Circumcision a legal <HI>Pollution,</HI> utterly disqua∣lifying for the Privileges of the Sanctuary. This Law, the <HI>Jews</HI> supposed, made the very Infants of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> Sinners, polluted and hateful to God; they being uncir∣cumcis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and born of uncircumcised Parents. But the Apostle proves, against these Notions of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that the Nations of the World don't become Sinners by Na∣ture, and Sinners from Infancy, by Virtue of <HI>their Law,</HI> in this Manner, but by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin: In-as-much as In∣fants were treated as Sinners long <HI>before</HI> the Law of Cir∣cumci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion was given, as well as before they had committed actual Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="008118_0303_0F6B58522B5E8618"/>What has been said, may, as I humbly conceive, lead us to that which is the <HI>true</HI> Scope &amp; Sense of the Apostle in these three Verses; which I will endeavour more briefly to represent in the following <HI>Paraphrase.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13. <HI>For until the Law Sin was in the World; But Sin is not imputed, when there is not Law.</HI></NOTE>"It is manifest, that it was in this Way the World became sinful and guilty: and not in that Way which the <HI>Jews</HI> suppose, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Law, given by <HI>Moses,</HI> is the grand univer∣sal Rule of Righteousness &amp; Judgment for Mankind, and that it is by being <HI>Gentiles,</HI> uncircumcised and Aliens from that Law, that the Nations of the World are <HI>constituted Sinners</HI> and unclean.

from <HI>Adam'</HI>s Violation of the original Law of Works; which shews, that the original, universal Rule of Righteousness is not the Law of <HI>Mo∣ses;</HI> for if so, there would have been no Sin imputed <HI>before</HI> that was given; because Sin is not imputed, when there is no Law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14. <HI>Nevertheless, Death reigned from</HI> Adam <HI>to</HI> Moses, <HI>even over them that had not sinned after the Similitude of</HI> A∣dam's <HI>Transgressi∣on.</HI></NOTE> "But, that at that Time Sin was <HI>imputed,</HI> and Men were by their Judge reckoned as <HI>Sinners,</HI> thrô Guilt and Corruption derived from <HI>Adam,</HI> and condemned for Sin to <HI>Death,</HI> the pro∣per Punishment of Sin, we have a plain Proof; in that it appears in Fact, all Mankind, during that whole Time which prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> were subjected to that temporal Death, which is the visible Intro∣duction and Image of that utter De∣struction which Sin deserves; not ex∣cepting even <HI>Infants,</HI> who could be Sinners no other Way than by virtue of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Transgression, having ne∣ver in their own Persons actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd as <HI>Adam</HI> did; nor could at that Time be made polluted by the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> as being uncircumcised, or born of uncircumcised Parents."</P>
<P>Now, by way of Reflection on the whole, I would ob∣serve, that though there are two or three Expressions in this Paragraph, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 12, &amp;c, the Design of which is attended with some Difficulty and Obscurity, as particularly in the 13th &amp; 14th Verses; yet the Scope and Sense of the Discourse in general is not obscure, but on the contrary very clear and manifest; and so is the parti∣cular Doctrine mainly taught in it. The Apostle sets him∣self
<PB N="285" REF="008118_0305_0F6B5853807D0BB8"/>
with great Care and Pains to make it plain, and pre∣cisely to fix and settle the Point he is upon. And the Discourse is so framed, that one Part of it does greatly clear and fix the Meaning of other Parts; and the Whole is determined by the clear Connection it stands in with other Parts of the Epistle, and by the manifest Drift of all the preceeding Part of it.</P>
<P>The Doctrine of <HI>original Sin</HI> is not only here taught, but most plainly, explicitly and abundantly taught. This Doctrine is asserted, expresly or implicitly, in almost every Verse; and in some of the Verses several Times. 'Tis fully implied in that first Expression in the 12th v. <HI>By one Man Sin entred into the World.</HI> Which implies, that Sin became <HI>universal</HI> in the World; as the Apostle had before largely shewn it was; and not meerly (which would be a trifling insignificant Observation) that one Man, who was made first, sin'd first, before other Men sin'd; or, that it did not so happen that many Men began to sin just toge∣ther at the same Moment.—The latter Part of the Verse, <HI>And Death by Sin, and so Death passed upon all Men, for that</HI> (or, if you will, <HI>unto which</HI>) <HI>all have sinned,</HI> shews, that in the Eye of the Judge of the World, in <HI>Adam's</HI> first Sin, <HI>all</HI> sinned; not only <HI>in some Sort,</HI> but all sin'd <HI>so</HI> as to be exposed to that <HI>Death,</HI> and final De∣struction, which is the proper <HI>Wages of Sin.</HI>—The same Doctrine is taught again twice over in the 14th v. It is there observed, as a Proof of this Doctrine, that <HI>Death reigned over them which had not sinned after the Simili∣tude of</HI> Adam's <HI>Transgression,</HI> i. e. by their personal Act; and therefore could be exposed to Death, only by deriv∣ing Guilt and Pollution from <HI>Adam,</HI> in Consequence of his Sin. And 'tis taught again, in those Words, <HI>Who is the Figure of him that was to come.</HI> The Resemblance lies very much in this Circumstance, <HI>viz.</HI> our deriving Sin, Guilt and Punishment by <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, as we do Righteousness, Justification, and the Reward of Life by Christ's Obedience: for so the Apostle explains himself.—The same Doctrine is expresly taught again, v 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th.
<PB N="286" REF="008118_0306_0F6B58545A1E2070"/>
<HI>Through the Offence of one many be dead.</HI> And again, twice in the 16th v. <HI>It was by one that sinned,</HI> i. e. It was by <HI>Adam</HI> that Guilt and Punishment (before spoken of) came on Mankind: And in these Words, <HI>Judgment was by one to Condemnation.</HI>—It is again plainly and fully laid down in the 17th v. <HI>By one Man's Offence, Death reign∣ed by one.</HI> So again in the 18th v. <HI>By the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</HI>—Again, very plainly in the 19th v. <HI>By one Man's Dis∣obedience, many were made Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>And here is every Thing to determine &amp; fix the <HI>Mean∣ing</HI> of all important <HI>Terms,</HI> that the Apostle makes Use of: As, the <HI>abundant Use</HI> of 'em in all Parts of the New Testament; and especially in this Apostle's Writings, which make up a very great Part of the New Testament: and his repeated Use of 'em in this Epistle in particular, espe∣cially in the preceeding Part of the Epistle, which leads to and introduces this Discourse, and in the former Part of this very Chapter; and also, the <HI>Light,</HI> that one Sentence in this Paragraph casts on another; which fully settles their Meaning: As, with respect to the Words, <HI>Justifica∣tion, Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Condemnation;</HI> and above all, in regard of the Word, <HI>Sin,</HI> which is the most important of all, with Relation to the Doctrine and Controversy we are upon. Besides the constant Use of this Term every where else thro' the new Testament, thro' the Epistles of this Apostle, this Epistle in particular, and even the former Part of this Chapter, 'tis often repeated in this very Para∣graph, and evidently used in the very Sense, that is denied to belong to it in the End of v. 12th, and v. 19th, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own'd every where else; and its Meaning is fully deter∣mined by the Apostle's varying the Term; using together with it, to signify the same thing, such a Variety of other synonymous Words, such as <HI>Offence, Transgression, Dis∣obedience.</HI> And further, to put the Matter out of all Controversy, 'tis particularly and expresly, and repeatedly distinguished from that which our Opposers would <HI>explain</HI> it by, viz. <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> And what is meant
<PB N="287" REF="008118_0307_0F6B585501104338"/>
by <HI>Sin's entering into the World,</HI> in v. 12th, is determin'd by a like Phrase of <HI>Sin's being in the World,</HI> in the next Verse.—And that by the <HI>Offence of one,</HI> so often spoken of here, as bringing Death and Condemnation on all, the Apostle means the Sin of one, derived in it's Guilt and Pollution to Mankind in general, is a Thing which (over and above all that has been already observed) is settled and determined by those Words in the Conclusion of this Dis∣course. v. 20. <HI>Moreover, the Law entred, that the Offence might abound: But where Sin abounded, Grace did much more abound.</HI> These Words plainly shew, that the OFFENCE, spoken of so often, and evidently spoken of still in these Words, which was the Offence of <HI>one</HI> Man, became the Sin of <HI>all.</HI> For when he says, <HI>The Law en∣tred, that the Offence might abound,</HI> his Meaning can't be, that the Offence of <HI>Adam,</HI> meerly as <HI>his</HI> personally, should <HI>abound;</HI> but, as it exists in it's <HI>derived</HI> Guilt, cor∣rupt Influence, and evil Fruits, in the Sin of Mankind in general, even as a Tree in it's Root and Branches.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Offence,</HI> according to Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Explanation, don't <HI>abound</HI> by the <HI>Law</HI> at all really and truly, in any Sense; nei∣ther the <HI>Sin,</HI> nor the <HI>Punishment.</HI> For he says, <Q>The Mean∣ing is not, that Men should be made more wicked; but, that Men should be liable to Death for every Trans∣gression.</Q>—But after all, they are liable to no more Deaths, nor to any worse Deaths, if they are not more sinful: For they were to have Punishment, according to their Deserts <HI>before.</HI> Such as died and went into another World before the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was given, were punished according to their <HI>Deserts;</HI> and the <HI>Law,</HI> when it came, thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tned no more.</NOTE></P>
<P>'Tis a Thing that confirms the Certainty of the <HI>Proof</HI> of the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which this Place affords, that the utmost Art <HI>cannot</HI> pervert it to <HI>another</HI> Sense. What a Variety of the most artful Methods have been used by the <HI>Enemies</HI> of this Doctrine, to <HI>wrest</HI> and <HI>darken</HI> this Paragraph of holy Writ, which stands so much in their Way, as it were to <HI>force</HI> the Bible to speak a Language that is agreable to their Mind!

<P>'Tis really no less than <HI>abusing</HI> the Scripture and its Readers, to represent this Paragraph as the most <HI>obscure</HI> of all the Places of Scripture, that speak of the Consequen∣ces of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin; and to treat it as if there was Need first to consider other Places as more <HI>plain.</HI> Whereas, 'tis most manifestly a Place in which these things are declared, beyond all, the most plainly, particularly, precisely and of set Purpose, by that great Apostle, who has most fully ex∣plain▪d to us those Doctrines, in general, which relate to the Redemption by Christ, and the Sin and Misery we are redeem'd from.—And it must be now left to the Reader's Judgment, whether the Christian Church has not proceed∣ed reasonably, in looking on this as a Place of Scripture most clearly and fully treating of these things, &amp; in using it's determinate Sense as an Help to settle the Meaning of many other Passages of sacred Writ.</P>
<P>As this Place in general is very plain and full, so the Doctrine of the Corruption of Nature, as derived from <HI>Adam,</HI> and also the Imputation of his first Sin, are <HI>both</HI> clearly taught in it. The <HI>Imputation</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI> one Transgression, is indeed most directly &amp; frequently asserted. We are here assured, that <HI>by one Man's Sin, Death passed on all;</HI> all being adjudged to this Punishment, as having <HI>sinned</HI> (so it is implied) in that one Man's Sin. And 'tis repented over and over, that <HI>all are condemned, many are dead, many made Sinners,</HI> &amp;c. by <HI>one Man's Offence, by the Disobedience of one,</HI> and <HI>by one Offence.</HI>—And the Doctrine of original <HI>Depravity</HI> is also here taught, when
<PB N="289" REF="008118_0309_0F6B585972BF2E30"/>
the Apostle says, <HI>By one Man Sin enter'd into the World;</HI> having a plain Respect (as hath been shewn) to that univer∣sal Corruption and Wickedness, as well as Guilt, which he had before largely treated of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Evidence of Original Sin from the Nature of Redemption, in the Procurement of it.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme, a very great Part of Mankind are the Subjects of Christ's <HI>Redemption,</HI> who live and die perfectly <HI>innocent;</HI> who never have had, and never will have any <HI>Sin</HI> charged to their Account, and never are either the Subjects of, or exposed to any <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> whatsoever, <HI>viz.</HI> All that die in <HI>Infancy.</HI> They are the Subjects of <HI>Christ's Redemption,</HI> as he redeems 'em from <HI>Death,</HI> or as they by his Righteousness have <HI>Justi∣fication,</HI> and by his Obedience are <HI>made Righteous,</HI> in the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Body, in the Sense of <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 18, 19. And <HI>all</HI> Mankind are thus the Subjects of Christ's Redemp∣tion, while they are perfectly guiltless, and exposed to no Punishment, as by Christ they are intitled to a <HI>Resurrection.</HI> Thô with respect to such Persons as have <HI>sinned,</HI> he allows it is <HI>in some Sort</HI> by Christ and his Death, that they are saved from Sin and the Punishment of it.</P>
<P>Now let us see whether such a Scheme well consists with the Scripture-Account of the Redemption by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="290" REF="008118_0310_0F6B58598E7829A0"/>1. The Representations of the Redemption by Christ, every where in Scripture, lead us to suppose, that <HI>all</HI> whom he came to redeem, are <HI>Sinners;</HI> that his Salvation, as to the Term <HI>from which</HI> (or the Evil to be redeemed from) in <HI>all</HI> is <HI>Sin,</HI> and the deserved <HI>Punishment</HI> of Sin. 'Tis natural to suppose, that when he had his Name <HI>Jesus,</HI> or <HI>Saviour,</HI> given him by God's special and immediate Ap∣pointment, the Salvation meant by that Name should be his Salvation in general; and not only a Part of his Sal∣vation, and with Regard only to some of them that he came to save. But this Name was given him to signify his <HI>sav∣ing his People from their Sins,</HI> Matth. i. 21. And the great Doctrine of Christ's Salvation is, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e came into the World to save Sinners,</HI> 1 Tim. i. 15. And that <HI>Christ hath once suffered, the just for the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust,</HI> 1 Pet. iii. 18. <HI>In this was manifested the Love of God towards us</HI> (to∣wards such in general as have the Benefit of God's Love in giving Christ) <HI>that God sent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live thro' Him. Herein is Love—that he sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins,</HI> 1 Joh. iv. 10. Many other Texts might be mention'd, which seem evidently to suppose, that all who are redeem'd by Christ, are saved from <HI>Sin.</HI> We are led by what Christ himself said, to suppose, that if any are not <HI>Sinners,</HI> they have <HI>no Need</HI> of him as a Redeemer, any more then a well Man of a Physician, <HI>Mark</HI> ii. 17. And that Men, in order to being the proper Subjects of the Mercy of God through Christ, must first be in a State of <HI>Sin,</HI> is implied in <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 22. <HI>But the Scripture hath concluded all under</HI> Sin, <HI>that the Promise by Faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</HI> To the same Effect is <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 32.</P>
<P>These Things are greatly confirmed by the Scripture∣Doctrine of <HI>Sacrifices.</HI> 'Tis abundantly plain, by both old and new Testament, that they were Types of Christ's Death, and were for Sin, and supposed Sin in those for whom they were offered. The Apostle supposes, that in Order to any having the Benefit of <HI>the eternal Inheri∣tance</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="008118_0311_0F6B585AAE2D4DE8"/>
by Christ, <HI>there must of Necessity</HI> be the <HI>Death of the Testator;</HI> and gives that Reason for it, that <HI>without shedding of Blood there is no Remission.</HI> Heb. ix. 15, &amp;c. And Christ Himself, in representing the Benefit of his Blood, in the Institution of the Lord's Supper, under the Notion of the Blood of a <HI>Testament,</HI> calls it <HI>the Blood of the New Testament, shed for the Remission of Sins,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 28.—But according to the Scheme of our Author, many have the eternal Inheritance by the Death of the Testator, who never had any Need of Remission.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Scripture represents the Redemption by Christ as a Redemption from <HI>deserved</HI> Destruction; and that, not meerly as it respects some Particulars, but as the Fruit of God's Love to Mankind. Joh. iii. 16. <HI>God so loved the WORLD; that he gave his only begotten Son, that who∣soever believeth in him MIGHT NOT PERISH, but might have everlasting Life.</HI> Implying, that otherwise they must perish, or be destroyed. But what Necessity of this, if they did not <HI>deserve</HI> to be destroyed? Now, that the Destruction here spoken of, is deserved Destruction, is manifest, because it is there compared to the perishing of such of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> as died by the Bite of the fiery <HI>Serpents,</HI> which God in his Wrath, for their <HI>Rebel∣lion,</HI> sent amongst them. And the same Thing clearly appears by the last Verse of the same Chapter, <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting Life; and be that believeth not the Son, shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> or, is left remaining on him: Implying, that all in general <HI>are found</HI> under the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God, and that they only of all Mankind; who are inte∣re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in Christ, have this Wrath <HI>removed,</HI> and eternal Life bestowed; the rest are <HI>left,</HI> with the <HI>Wrath of God still remaining on them.</HI> The same is clearly illustrated and confirmed by <HI>Joh.</HI> v. 24.—<HI>He that believeth—hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into Condemnation, but is passed from Death to Life.</HI> In being passed from Death to Life is implied, that before they were all in a State of Death; and they are spoken of as being so by a
<PB N="292" REF="008118_0312_0F6B585BE4780B58"/>
Sentence of <HI>Condemnation;</HI> and if it be a <HI>just</HI> Condem∣nation, 'tis a <HI>deserved</HI> Condemnation.</P>
<P N="3">III. It will follow on Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme, that Christ's Redemption, with regard to a great Part of them who are the Subjects of it, is not only a Redemption from <HI>no Sin,</HI> but from <HI>no Calamity,</HI> and so from <HI>no Evil</HI> of any Kind. For as to <HI>Death,</HI> which <HI>Infants</HI> are redeemed from, they never were subjected to it as a Calamity, but purely as a <HI>Benefit.</HI> It came by no Threatning, or Curse, denounced upon or through <HI>Adam;</HI> the Covenant with him being utterly <HI>a∣bolished,</HI> as to all it's Force &amp; Power on Mankind (accord∣ing to our Author) before the pronouncing the Sentence of Mortality. Therefore Trouble and Death could be appointed to innocent Mankind, no other Way than on the Foot of another Covenant, the Covenant of <HI>Grace;</HI> and in this Channel they come only as <HI>Favours,</HI> not as Evils. Therefore they could need no Medicine or Remedy; for they had no Disease. Even Death itself, which it is sup∣posed Christ saves 'em from, is only a Medicine; 'tis pre∣venting Phy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick, and one of the greatest of Benefits. It's ridiculous, to talk of Persons needing a Medicine, or a Physician, to save 'em from an excellent Medicine; or of a Remedy from a happy Remedy! If it be said, tho' Death be a Benefit, yet 'tis so because Christ <HI>changes</HI> it, and turns it into a Benefit, by procuring a <HI>Resurrection:</HI>—I would here ask, What can be meant by <HI>turning</HI> or <HI>changing</HI> it into a Benefit, when it never <HI>was</HI> otherwise, nor could ever <HI>justly be</HI> otherwise? <HI>Infants</HI> could not at all be brought under Death as a Calamity: for they never <HI>deserved</HI> it. And it would be only an Abuse (be it far from us, to ascribe such a Thing to God) in any Being, to make the Offer, to any poor Sufferers, of a Redeemer from some Ca∣lamity, which <HI>he</HI> had brought upon them without the least <HI>Desert</HI> of it on their Part.</P>
<P>But it is plain, that Death or Mortality was not at first brought on Mankind as a Blessing, on the Foot of the Co∣venant of Grace through Christ, and that Christ and Grace don't <HI>bring</HI> Mankind under Death, but <HI>find</HI> 'em
<PB N="293" REF="008118_0313_0F6B585CE31AA608"/>
under it. 1 Cor. v. 14. <HI>We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead.</HI> Luk. x. 10. <HI>The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</HI> The Grace, which appears in providing a Deliverer from any State, supposes the Subject to be in that State <HI>prior</HI> to that Grace and Deliverance; and not that such a State is first introduced by that Grace. In our Author's Scheme, there never could be any Sentence of Death, or Condem∣nation, that requires a Saviour from it; because the very Sentence itself, according to the true Meaning of it, im∣plies and makes sure all that Good, which is requisite to abolish and make void the seeming Evil to the innocent Subject. So that the Sentence itself is in Effect the De∣liverer; and there is no Need of another Deliverer, to deliver from that Sentence. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> insists upon it, that <Q>Nothing comes upon us in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, in any SENSE, KIND, or DEGREE, inconsistent with the <HI>original Blessing</HI> pronounced on <HI>Adam,</HI> at his Creation; and Nothing but what is perfectly consistent with God's Blessing, Love, and Goodness, declared to <HI>Adam,</HI> as soon as he came out of his Maker's Hands.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 364, 365.</NOTE> If the Case be so, it is certain there is no Evil or Calamity at all, for Christ to redeem us from; unless <HI>Things agre∣able to the divine Goodness, Love &amp; Blessing,</HI> are Things which we need Redemption from.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It will follow on our Author's Principles, not only with Respect to Infants, but even <HI>adult</HI> Persons, that Re∣demption is <HI>needless,</HI> and Christ is dead in vain. Not only is there no Need of Christ's Redemption in Order to De∣liverance from any Consequences of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, but also in Order to perfect Freedom from personal Sin, and all it's evil Consequences. For God has made other sufficient Provision for that, <HI>viz. a sufficient Power and Ability, in all Mankind, to do all their Duty, and wholly to avoid Sin.</HI> Yea, this Author insists upon it, that <Q>when Men have not sufficient <HI>Power</HI> to do their Duty, they have
<PB N="294" REF="008118_0314_0F6B585D52108AD0"/>
<HI>no</HI> Duty to do.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 111. 339, 340.</NOTE> We may Safely &amp; assuredly conclude (says he) that Mankind in all Parts of the World have SUFFICIENT Power to do the Duty, which God requires of them; and that he requires of 'em NO MORE than they have SUFFICIENT Power to do.</Q> And in another Place,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 343.</NOTE> <Q>God has given Powers EQUAL to the Duty, which he expects.</Q> And he express a great Dislike at R. R's supposing, <Q>that our Propen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities to Evil, and Temptations, are too strong to be EFFEC∣TUALLY and CONSTANTLY resisted;—or that we are unavoidably sinful IN A DEGREE, that our Appetites and Passions will be breaking out, not∣withstanding our everlasting Watchfulness.</Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P▪ 344.</NOTE> These Things fully imply, that Men have in their own natural Ability sufficient Means to avoid Sin, and to be perfectly free from it; and so, from all the bad Consequences of it. And if the Means are <HI>sufficient,</HI> then there is no Need of <HI>more.</HI> And therefore there is no Need of Christ's dying in Order to it. What Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says in P. 348. fully implies, that it would be unjust in God, to give Mankind Being in such Circumstances, as that they would be more likely to sin, so as to be exposed to final Misery, than otherwise. Hence then, without Christ and his Redemption, and without any Grace at all, MEER JUSTICE makes <HI>sufficient Pro∣vision</HI> for our being free from Sin and Misery, by our own Power.</P>
<P>If all Mankind, in all Parts of the World, have such sufficient Power to do their whole Duty, without being sinful <HI>in any Degree,</HI> then they have sufficient Power to obtain Righteousness by the Law: And then, according to the Apostle <HI>Paul, Christ is dead in vain.</HI> Gal. ii. 21. <HI>If Righteousness come by the Law, Christ is dead in vain;</HI>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, without the Article, <HI>by Law,</HI> or the Rule of right Action, as our Author explains the Phrase.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pref. to Par. on <HI>Rom.</HI> §. 38.</NOTE> And accord∣ing to the Sense in which he explains this very Place, <Q>It
<PB N="295" REF="008118_0315_0F6B585E5F9D2F78"/>
would have frustrated, or rendered useless, the Grace of God, if Christ died to accomplish what was or MIGHT have been effected by Law itself, without his Death.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 20.</NOTE> So that it most clearly follows from his own Doctrine, that <HI>Christ is dead in vain,</HI> and the Grace of God is <HI>use∣less.</HI> The same Apostle says, <HI>If there had been a Law which COULD have given Life, verily Righteousness should have been by the Law,</HI> Gal. iii. 21. i. e. (still according to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s own Sense) if there was a Law, that Man, in his present State, had sufficient Power per∣fectly to fulfil. For Dr. <HI>T.</HI> supposes the Reason why the Law could not give Life, to be, <Q>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because it was weak in itself, but thro' the Weakness of our Flesh, and the Infirmity of the human Nature in the present State.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> But he says, <Q>We are under a mild Dispensation of GRACE, making Allowance for our Infirmities.</Q><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 368.</NOTE> By <HI>our Infirmities,</HI> we may upon good Grounds suppose, he means that Infirmity of human Nature, which he gives as the Reason, why the Law can't give Life. But what <HI>Grace</HI> is there in making that Allowance for our Infirmi∣ties, which <HI>Justice</HI> itself (according to his Doctrine) most absolutely requires, as he supposes divine Justice exactly proportions our Duty to our Ability?</P>
<P>Again, If it be said, that altho' Christ's Redemption was not necessary to preserve Men from <HI>beginning</HI> to sin, and getting into a Course of Sin, because they have suffi∣cient Power in themselves to avoid it; yet it may be ne∣cessary to deliver Men, <HI>after</HI> they have by their own Folly brought themselves under the <HI>Dominion</HI> of evil Appetites and Passions. <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">See P. 228. and also what he says of the helpless State of the Heathen, in <HI>Paraph.</HI> and <HI>Notes</HI> on <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. and Begin∣ning of Chap. viii.</NOTE> I answer, if it be so, that Men need De∣liverance from those Habits and Passions, which are be∣come too strong for them, yet that Deliverance, on our Au∣thor's Principles, would be no Salvation from <HI>Sin.</HI> For, the Exercise of Passions which are too strong for us, and
<PB N="296" REF="008118_0316_0F6B585EBAC77088"/>
which we can't overcome, is <HI>necessary;</HI> and he strongly urges, that a necessary Evil can be no <HI>moral</HI> Evil. It's true, 'tis the <HI>Effect</HI> of Evil as 'tis the <HI>Effect</HI> of a bad Practice, while the Man remain'd at Liberty, and had Power to have avoided it. But then, according to Dr. <HI>T—r,</HI> that evil <HI>Cause</HI> alone is Sin; and not so, the necessary <HI>Effect:</HI> For he says expresly, <Q>The Cause of every Effect, <HI>alone,</HI> is chargeable with the Effect it pro∣duceth, or which proceedeth from it.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 128.</NOTE>—And as to that Sin which was the <HI>Cause,</HI> the Man needed no Saviour from <HI>that,</HI> having had <HI>sufficient Power</HI> in himself to have avoided it. So that it follows, by our Author's Scheme, that <HI>none</HI> of Mankind, neither Infants, nor adult Persons, neither the more nor less vicious, neither <HI>Jews</HI> nor <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> neither <HI>Heathens</HI> nor <HI>Christians,</HI> ever did, or ever could stand in any <HI>Need</HI> of a Saviour; and that, with respect to <HI>all,</HI> the Truth is, <HI>Christ is dead in vain.</HI></P>
<P>If any should say, Although all Mankind in all Ages have sufficient Ability to do their whole Duty, and so may by their own Power enjoy perfect Freedom from Sin, yet God <HI>foresaw</HI> that they <HI>would sin,</HI> and that <HI>after</HI> they had sin'd they would need Christ's Death:—I answer, It's plain by what the Apostle says, in those Places which were just now mention'd, <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 21. &amp; iii. 21. that God would have esteemed it needless to give his Son to die for Men, unless there had been a prior Impossibility of their having Righteousness by Law; and that <HI>if there had been a Law which COULD have given Life,</HI> this other Way by the Death of Christ would not have been provided. And this appears to be agreable to our Author's own Sense of Things, by his Words which have been cited, wherein he says, <Q>It would have FRUSTRATED or rendred USELESS the Grace of God, if Christ died to accom∣plish what was or MIGHT HAVE BEEN effected by Law itself, without his Death.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="297" REF="008118_0317_0F6B5861B691CD88"/>V. It will follow on Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Scheme, not only that Christ's Redemption is <HI>needless</HI> for the saving from Sin or it's Consequences, but also that it does <HI>no Good</HI> that Way, has no Tendency to any <HI>Diminution</HI> of Sin in the World. For as to any <HI>Infusion</HI> of Virtue or Holiness into the Heart, by divine Power, through Christ or his Re∣demption, it is altogether inconsistent with this Author's Notions. With him, <HI>inwrought</HI> Virtue, if there were any such thing, would be <HI>no</HI> Virtue; not being the Effect of our own Will, Choice &amp; Design, but only of a sovereign Act of God's Power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 245, 250, 180.</NOTE> And therefore, all that Christ does to increase Virtue, is only increasing our Talents, our Light, Advantages, Means and Motives; as he often explains the Matter. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In P. 44. P. 50. &amp; innumer∣able other Places.</NOTE> But <HI>Sin</HI> is not at all diminished. For he says, <HI>Our Duty must be measured by our Talents:</HI> as, a Child that has less Talents, has less Duty; and therefore must be no more exposed to commit Sin, than he that has greater Talents; because he that has greater Talents, has more Duty required, in exact Proportion.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See P. 55, 224, 234, 337, 338▪ 342, 343, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4, 345.</NOTE> If so, he that has but <HI>one</HI> Talent, has as much <HI>Advantage</HI> to perform that <HI>one</HI> Degree of Duty which is required of him, as he that has <HI>free</HI> Talents, to perform his <HI>five</HI> Degrees of Duty, and is no more exposed to fail of it. And that Man's <HI>Guilt,</HI> who sins against <HI>greater</HI> Advantages, Means and Motives, is <HI>greater</HI> in Proportion to his Talents.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Paraph. on Rom. ii. 9▪ also on <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> 12.</NOTE> And therefore it will follow, on Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Principles, that Men stand no better Chance, have no more eligible or valuable Probability of Freedom from Sin &amp; Punishment, or of con∣tracting but little Guilt, or of performing required Duty, with the great Advantages &amp; Talents implied in Christ's Redemp∣tion, than without them; when all things are computed, and put into the Balances together, the Numbers, Degrees &amp; Ag∣gravations of Sin exposed to, Degrees of Duty required,&amp;c.
<PB N="298" REF="008118_0318_0F6B5862CD223690"/>
So that Men have no Redemption from Sin, and no new Means of performing Duty, that are valuable or worth any thing at all. And thus the great Redemption by Christ in every respect comes to Nothing, with regard both to In∣fants and adult Persons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Evidence of the Doctrine of Original Sin from what the Scripture teaches of the Application of Redemption.</HEAD>
<P>THE Truth of the Doctrine of Original Sin is very clearly manifest from what the Scripture says of that <HI>Change of State,</HI> which it represents as necessary to an actual Interest in the spiritual and eternal Blessings of the Redeemer's Kingdom.</P>
<P>In order to this, it speaks of it as absolutely necessary for every one, that he be regenerated, or <HI>born again.</HI> Joh. iii. 3. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a Man <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, be begotten again,</HI> or <HI>born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> tho' he will not allow, that this signifies any Change from a State of <HI>natural Pro∣pensity</HI> to Sin, yet supposes, that the new Birth here spoken of means a Man's being brought to a <HI>divine Life, in a right Use and Application of the natural Powers in a Life of true Holiness:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 144.</NOTE> and that it is the Attainment of <HI>those Habits of Virtue and Religion, gives us the real Character of true Christians, and the Children of God;</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 246, 248.</NOTE> and that it is <HI>putting on the new Nature of right Action.</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 251.</NOTE></P>
<P>But in order to proceed in the most sure &amp; safe Manner, in our understanding what is meant in Scripture by <HI>being born again,</HI> and so in the Inferences we draw from what is said of the Necessity of it, let us compare Scripture with Scripture, and consider what <HI>other</HI> Terms or Phrases are used, in other Places, where Respect is evidently had to the same Change. And here I would observe the follow∣ing Things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="299" REF="008118_0319_0F6B586363DB0808"/>I. If we compare one Scripture with another, it will be sufficiently manifest, that by Regeneration, or being <HI>begotten</HI> or <HI>born again,</HI> the same Change in the State of the Mind is signified, with that which the Scripture speaks of as effected in true REPENTANCE and CONVER∣SION. I put Repentance and Conversion together, be∣cause the Scripture puts them together, <HI>Act.</HI> iii. 19. and because they plainly signify much the same Thing. The Word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (Repentance) signifies a <HI>Change of the Mind;</HI> as the Word, Conversion, means a <HI>Change</HI> or <HI>Turning</HI> from Sin to God. And that this is the same Change with that which is called <HI>Regeneration</HI> (excepting that this latter Term especially signifies the Change, as the Mind is <HI>passive</HI> in it) the following Things do shew.</P>
<P>In the Change which the Mind passes under in <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> and <HI>Conversion,</HI> is attain'd that Character of true Christians, which is necessary to the eternal Privileges of such. Act. iii. 19. Repent <HI>ye therefore, and be</HI> converted, <HI>that your Sins may be blotted out, when the Times of Refreshing shall come from the Presence of the Lord Jesus.</HI>—And so it is with Regeneration; as is evident from what Christ says to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and as is allowed by Dr. <HI>T.</HI></P>
<P>The Change the Mind passes under in Repentance and Conversion, is that in which saving <HI>Faith</HI> is attained. <HI>Mark</HI> i. 15. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand, repent ye and believe the Gospel.</HI>—And so it is with a being born again, or born of <HI>God;</HI> as appears by <HI>Joh.</HI> i. 12, 13. <HI>But to as many as received him, to them gave be Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that BELIEVE on his Name, which were</HI> born, <HI>not of Blood,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Just as Christ says concerning Conversion, Matth. xviii. 3. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted and become as little Children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of God:</HI> So does he say concerning being born again, in what he spake to <HI>Nicodemus.</HI></P>
<P>By the Change Men pass under in Conversion, they become <HI>as little Children;</HI> which appears in the Place last

cited: And so they do by Regeneration. 1 Pet. i. at the End, and Chap. ii. at the Beginning. <HI>Being born again—Wherefore—as new-born Babes, desire</HI>—&amp;c. 'Tis no Objection, that the Disciples, whom Christ spake to in <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. 3. were converted already: This makes it not less proper for Christ to declare the Necessity of Con∣version to them, leaving it with them to try themselves, and to make sure their Conversion: In like Manner as he declared to 'em the Necessity of <HI>Repentance,</HI> in <HI>Luk.</HI> xiii. 3, 5. <HI>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI></P>
<P>The Change that Men pass under at their <HI>Repentance,</HI> is expressed and exhibited by <HI>Baptism.</HI> Hence it-is called the <HI>Baptism of Repentance,</HI> from Time to Time. <HI>Matth.</HI> iii. 11. <HI>Luk.</HI> iii. 3. <HI>Act.</HI> xix. 4. and ii. 38. And so is Re∣generation or being born again express'd by Baptism: as is evident by such Representations of Regeneration as those, Joh. iii. 5. <HI>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit</HI>—Tit. iii. 5. <HI>He saved us by the Washing of Regeneration.</HI>—Many other Things might be observed, to shew, that the Change Men pass under in their Repen∣tance and Conversion, is the <HI>same</HI> with that which they are the Subjects of in Regeneration.—But these Observa∣tions may be sufficient.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Change which a Man passes under when born again, and in his Repentance and Conversion, is the same that the Scripture calls the CIRCUMCISION OF THE HEART.—This may easily appear by considering.</P>
<P>That as Regeneration is that in which are attained the Habits of true Virtue and Holiness, as has been shewn, and as is confessed; so is <HI>Circumcision of Heart.</HI> Deut. xxx. 6. <HI>And the Lord thy God will</HI> circumcise thine Heart, <HI>and the</HI> Heart <HI>of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy God, with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Regeneration is that whereby Men come to have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Character of true Christians; as is evident, and as is co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fessed; and so is <HI>Circumcision of Heart:</HI> for by this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> become <HI>Jews inwardly,</HI> or <HI>Jews</HI> in the Spiritual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Christian Sense</HI> (and that is the same as being <HI>true Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ans)</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="008118_0321_0F6B586683151BB8"/>
as of old <HI>Proselytes</HI> were made <HI>Jews</HI> by Circumcision of the Flesh. Rom. ii. 28, 29. <HI>For he is not a</HI> Jew, <HI>which is one outwardly; neither is that</HI> Circumcision, <HI>which is outward in the Flesh: But he is a</HI> Jew, <HI>which is one inwardly; and</HI> Circumcision <HI>is that</HI> of the Heart, <HI>in the Spirit and not in the Letter, whose Praise is not of Men, but of God.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Circumcision of the Heart</HI> is the same with Con∣version, or turning from Sin to God, is evident by Jer. iv. 1,—4. <HI>If thou wilt return, O Israel,</HI> return (or, con∣vert) unto me.—Circumcise <HI>yourselves to the Lord, and put away the Foreskins</HI> of your Heart. And Deut. x. 16. Circumcise <HI>therefore the Foreskin of thine</HI> Heart, <HI>and be no more stiff-necked.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Circumcision of the Heart</HI> is the same Change of the Heart, that Men pass under in their <HI>Repentance;</HI> as is evident by Levi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. xxvi. 4. <HI>If their</HI> uncircumcised Heart <HI>be humbled; and they accept the Punishment of their Ini∣quity</HI>—</P>
<P>The Change Men pass under in <HI>Regeneration, Repen∣tance</HI> and <HI>Conversion,</HI> is signified by <HI>Baptism,</HI> as has been shewn; and so is <HI>Circumcision of the Heart</HI> signified by the same Thing. None will deny, that it was this inter∣nal Circumcision, which of old was signified by external Cir∣cumcision; nor will any deny, now under the new Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣ment, that inward and spiritual Baptism, or the Cleansing of the Heart, is signify'd by external Washing, or Baptism. But spiritual Circumcision and spiritual Baptism are the same Thing; both being <HI>the putting off the Body of the Sins of the Flesh:</HI> as is very plain by Colos. ii. 11, 12, 13. <HI>In whom also ye are circumcised, with the</HI> Circum∣cision <HI>made without Hands, in</HI> putting off the Body of the Sins of the Flesh, <HI>by the Circumcision of Christ, buried with him in</HI> Baptism; <HI>wherein also ye are risen with him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">III. This inward Change, called <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and <HI>Circumcision of the Heart,</HI> which is wrought in <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Conversion,</HI> is the same with that spiritual RESUR∣RECTION
<PB N="302" REF="008118_0322_0F6B586795E796F8"/>
so often spoken of, and represented as a <HI>dying unto Sin, and living unto Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>This appears with great Plainness in that last cited Place, Col. ii. <HI>In whom also ye are circumcised with the Cir∣cumcis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on made without Hands—buried with him in Baptism, wherein also ye are</HI> risen with him, <HI>through the Faith of the Operation of God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And you, being dead in your Sins, and the Uncircumcision of your Flesh, hath he</HI> quicken'd together with him; <HI>having forgiven you all Trespasses.</HI></P>
<P>The same appears by Rom. vi. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his Death? Therefore we are buried with him by Baptism into Death; that like as Christ was</HI> raised up from the Dead, <HI>by the Glory of the Father,</HI> even so we also should walk in Newness of Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—v. 11. <HI>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be</HI> dead unto Sin, but alive unto God <HI>through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In which Place also it is evident, by the Words recited, and by the whole Context, that this spiritual Resurrection is that Change, in which Persons are brought to Habits of Holiness &amp; to the divine Life, by which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> describes the Thing obtain'd in being <HI>born again.</HI></P>
<P>That a <HI>spiritual Resurrection,</HI> to a new divine Life, should be called a being <HI>born again,</HI> is agreable to the Language of Scripture; in which we find, <HI>a Resurrection</HI> is called a <HI>being born</HI> or <HI>begotten.</HI> So those Words in the iid Psalm, <HI>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee,</HI> are applied to Christ's <HI>Resurrection,</HI> Act. xiii. 33. So in <HI>Colos.</HI> i. 18. Christ is called the <HI>first BORN from the Dead;</HI> and in <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 5. <HI>The first BEGOTTEN from the Dead.</HI> The Saints, in their <HI>Conversion</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Resurrection,</HI> are <HI>risen with Christ,</HI> and are <HI>begotten and born with him.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 3. <HI>Which hath</HI> begotten us a∣gain, <HI>to a lively Hope,</HI> by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, from the Dead, <HI>to an Inheritance incorruptible.</HI>—This Inheritance is the same Thing with that KINGDOM OR HEAVEN, which Men obtain by being <HI>born again,</HI> ac∣cording
<PB N="303" REF="008118_0323_0F6B5868AA37E068"/>
to Christ's Words to <HI>Nicodemus;</HI> and that same <HI>In∣heritance of them that are sanctified,</HI> spoken of as what is obtained in true CONVERSION.—Act. xxvi. 18. <HI>To turn them</HI> (or, convert them) <HI>from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may re∣ceive Forgiveness of Sins, &amp;</HI> Inheritance among them that are sanctified, <HI>thro' Faith that is in me.</HI>—Dr.<HI>T—r'</HI>s own Words, in his Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 4. speaking of that Place in the iid <HI>Psalm,</HI> just now mentioned, are very worthy to be here recited. He observes how this is applied to Christ's <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> &amp; Exaltation, in the New-Testament, and then has this Remark, <Q>Note, Begetting is conferring a new and happy State: A Son is a Person put into it. Agre∣ably to this, good Men are said to be the Sons of God, as they are the Sons of the <HI>Resurrection to eternal Life,</HI> which is represented as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a being BEGOT∣TEN or BORN AGAIN, REGENERATED.</Q></P>
<P>So that I think it is abundantly plain, that the <HI>spiritual Resurrection</HI> spoken of in Scripture, by which the Saints are brought to a new divine Life, is the same with that being <HI>born again,</HI> which Christ says is <HI>necessary</HI> for every one, in order to his seeing the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This Change, which Men are the Subjects of, when they are <HI>born again,</HI> and <HI>circumcised in Heart,</HI> when they <HI>repent,</HI> and are <HI>converted,</HI> and spiritually <HI>raised from the Dead,</HI> is the same Change which is meant when the Scripture speaks of making the HEART and SPIRIT NEW, or giving a <HI>new Heart and Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis needless here to stand to observe, how evidently this is spoken of as necessary to Salvation, and as the Change in which are attained the Habits of true Virtue and Holiness, and the Character of a true Saint; as has been observed of <HI>Regeneration, Conversion,</HI> &amp;c. and how apparent it is from thence, that the Change is the same. For it is as it were self-evident: 'Tis apparent by the Phrases themselves, that they are different Expressions of the same Thing. Thus <HI>Repentance</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) or the Change of the Mind is the same as being changed to a
<PB N="304" REF="008118_0324_0F6B5869445A6528"/>
NEW Mind, or new Heart and Spirit. <HI>Conversion</HI> is the turning of the Heart; which is the same Thing as chang∣ing it so, that there shall be another Heart, or a <HI>new Heart,</HI> or a new Spirit. To be <HI>born again,</HI> is to be born A NEW; which implies a becoming NEW, and is represented as a becoming <HI>new-born Babes:</HI> But none supposes, it is the <HI>Body,</HI> that is immediately and properly new, but the <HI>Mind, Heart,</HI> or <HI>Spirit.</HI> And so a <HI>spiritual Resurrection</HI> is the Resurrection of the Spirit, or rising to begin a NEW Ex∣istence and Life, as to the <HI>Mind, Heart</HI> or <HI>Spirit.</HI> So that all these Phrases imply an having a <HI>new Heart,</HI> and being <HI>renewed in the Spirit,</HI> according to their plain Sig∣nification.</P>
<P>When <HI>Nicodemus</HI> expressed his Wonder at Christ's de∣claring it necessary, that a Man should-be <HI>born again</HI> in order to see the Kingdom of God, or enjoy the Privileges of the Kingdom of the Messiah, Christ says to him, <HI>Art thou a Master of</HI> Israel, <HI>and know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not these things?</HI> i. e. 'Art thou one who is set to teach others, the Things written in the Law and the Prophets, and knowest not a Doctrine so plainly taught in your Scriptures, that such a Change as I speak of, is necessary to a partaking of the Blessings of the Kingdom of the Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iah'?—But what can Christ have Respect to in this, unless such Prophecies as that in Ezek. xxxvi. 25, 26, 27? Where God by the Prophet speaking of the Days of the Messiah's Kingdom, says, <HI>Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye shall be clean.—A NEW HEART also will I give you, and A NEW SPIRIT will I put within you—and I will put my Spirit within you.</HI> Here God speaks of having a <HI>new Heart</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> by being <HI>washed with Water,</HI> and receiving <HI>the Spirit of God,</HI> as the Qualification of God's People, that shall enjoy the Privileges of the Kingdom of the <HI>Messiah?</HI> How much is this like the Doctrine of Christ to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> of being <HI>born again of Water and of the Spirit?</HI> We have another like Prophecy in Ezek. xi. 19.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="008118_0325_0F6B586A04B74298"/>Add to these Things, that Regeneration or a <HI>being born again,</HI> and the RENEWING (or making new) by the Holy Ghost, are spoken of as the same Thing. Tit. iii. 5. <HI>By the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ashing of Regeneration and Renewing of the holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. 'Tis abundantly manifest, that being <HI>born again,</HI> a spiritually <HI>rising from the Dead,</HI> to <HI>Newness of Life,</HI> re∣ceiving a <HI>new Heart,</HI> &amp; being <HI>renewed in the Spirit of the Mind,</HI> these are the same Thing with that which is called <HI>putting off the OLD MAN, and putting on the NEW MAN.</HI></P>
<P>The Expressions are equivalent; and the Representa∣tions are plainly of the same Thing. When Christ speaks of being <HI>born again,</HI> two Births are supposed; a <HI>first</HI> and a <HI>second;</HI> an <HI>OLD Birth,</HI> and a <HI>NEW one:</HI> And the Thing born is called MAN. So, what is born in the first Birth, is the <HI>old MAN:</HI> and what is brought forth in the <HI>second Birth,</HI> is the <HI>new</HI> MAN. That which is born in the first Birth (says Christ) is <HI>Flesh:</HI> it is the <HI>car∣nal Man,</HI> wherein we have borne the Image of the <HI>earthly Adam,</HI> whom the Apostle calls the FIRST MAN. That which is born in the new Birth, is <HI>Spirit,</HI> or the spiritual and heavenly Man: wherein we proceed from Christ the SECOND MAN, the <HI>new Man,</HI> who is made a quicken∣ing Spirit, and is the Lord from Heaven, and the Head of the <HI>new Creation.</HI>—In the new Birth, Men are represented as becoming <HI>new-born Babes</HI> (as was observed before) which is the same thing as becoming <HI>New Men.</HI></P>
<P>And how apparently is what the Scripture says of the spiritual <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Christian Convert, equivalent and of the very same Import with putting, off the <HI>old Man,</HI> and putting on the <HI>new Man?</HI> So in the vith of <HI>Romans,</HI> the Convert is spoken of as <HI>dying</HI> and being <HI>buried with Christ:</HI> which is explained in the 6th v by this, that <HI>the OLD MAN is crucified, that the Body of Sin might be destroyed.</HI> And in the 14th v. Converts in this Change are spoken of as <HI>rising to NEWNESS of Life.</HI> Are not these Things plain enough? The Apostle does
<PB N="306" REF="008118_0326_0F6B586AC5F1AAE0"/>
in Effect tell us, that when he speaks of that spiritual Death and Resurrection which is in Conversion, he means the same Thing as <HI>crucifying and burying the old Man,</HI> and rising a <HI>New Man.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis most apparent, that spiritual <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and spiritual <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the spiritual <HI>Resurrection,</HI> are all the same with <HI>putting off the old Man,</HI> and <HI>putting on the new Man.</HI> This appears by Colos. ii. 11, 12. <HI>In whom also ye are circumcised with the CIRCUMCISI∣ON made without Hands, IN PUTTING OFF the Body of the Sins of the Flesh, by the Circumcision of Christ, buried with him by BAPTISM; wherein also ye are RISEN with him.</HI> Here it is manifest, that the spiritual Circumcision, Baptism, and Resurrection, all sig∣nify that Change, wherein Men <HI>put off the Body of the Sins of the Flesh:</HI> But that is the same Thing, in this Apostle's Language, as <HI>putting off the old Man;</HI> as ap∣pears by Rom. vi. 6. <HI>Our OLD MAN is crucified, that the BODY OF SIN may be destroyed.</HI>—And that putting off the <HI>old Man</HI> is the same with putting off the <HI>Body of Sins,</HI> appears further by <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 22, 23, 24. and <HI>Colos.</HI> iii. 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>As Dr. <HI>T.</HI> confesses, that a being <HI>born again</HI> is <Q>that wherein are obtained the Habits of Virtue, Religion and true Holiness</Q>; so how evidently is the same thing predicated of that Change, which is called <HI>putting off the Old Man,</HI> and <HI>putting on the New Man?</HI> Eph. iv. 22, 23, 24. <HI>That ye put off the Old Man, which is corrupt,</HI> &amp;c.—<HI>and put on the New Man, which, after God, is created IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUE HOLINESS.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis most plain, that this putting off the old Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the very same thing with making the <HI>Heart and Spirit new.</HI> 'Tis apparent in it self: the Spirit is call∣ed <HI>the Man,</HI> in the Language of the Apostle; 'tis called the <HI>inward Man,</HI> and the <HI>hidden Man.</HI> (Rom. vii. 22. 2 Cor. iv. 16. 1 Pet. iii. 4.) And therefore putting off the <HI>old Man,</HI> is the same thing with the Removal of the <HI>old
<PB N="307" REF="008118_0327_0F6B586C1CCD1BA0"/>
Heart,</HI> and the putting on the <HI>new Man</HI> is the receiving <HI>a new Heart and a new Spirit.</HI> Yea, putting on the <HI>new Man</HI> is expresly spoken of as the same Thing with receiv∣ing a <HI>new Spirit,</HI> or <HI>being renewed in Spirit.</HI> Eph. iv. 22, 23, 24. <HI>That ye put off the old Man—and be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind, and that ye put on the new Man.</HI></P>
<P>From these Things it appears, how unreasonable, and contrary to the utmost Degree of Scriptural Evidence, is Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Way of explaining the <HI>Old Man,</HI> and the <HI>New Man▪</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 425,—429.</NOTE> as tho' thereby were meant Nothing <HI>perso∣nal;</HI> but that by the <HI>old Man</HI> were meant the <HI>Heathen State,</HI> and by the <HI>New Man</HI> the <HI>Christian Dispensation,</HI> or State of professing Christians, or the whole <HI>collective Body of Professors of</HI> Christianity, made up of <HI>Jews &amp; Gentiles:</HI> When all the Colour he has for it, is, that the Apostle once calls the Christian Church a <HI>new Man,</HI> Eph. ii. 15. 'Tis very true, in the Scriptures, often, both in the old Testament and new, collective Bodies, Nations, Peo∣ples, Cities, are figuratively represented by Persons: particularly the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ is represented as <HI>one</HI> holy Person, and has the same Appellatives as a particular Saint or Believer; and so is called a <HI>Child</HI> and a <HI>Son of God,</HI> Exod. iv. 22. Gal. iv. 1, 2. and a <HI>Servant of God,</HI>Isai. xli. 8,9. &amp; xliv. 1. <HI>The Daughter of God,</HI>and<HI>Spouse of Christ,</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. xlv. 10, 13, 14. Rev. xix. 7—Nevertheless, would it be reasonable, to argue from hence, that such App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llations, as a <HI>Servant of God,</HI> a <HI>Child of God,</HI> &amp;c. are always, or commonly to be taken as signifying only the <HI>Church</HI> of God in general, or great collective Bodies; and not to be understood in a personal Sense? But certainly, this would not be more unreasonable, than to urge, that by the <HI>Old</HI> and the <HI>New Man,</HI> as the Phrases are mostly used in Scripture, is to be understood Nothing but the great col∣lective Bodies of Pagans and of Christians, or the Heathen and the Christian World, as to their <HI>outward</HI> Profession, and
<PB N="308" REF="008118_0328_0F6B586C8DFF5FC0"/>
the Dispensation they are under. It might have been proper, in this Case, to have considered the Unreasonable∣ness of that Practice which our Author charges on others, and finds so much Fault with in them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> <Q>That they con∣tent themselves with a <HI>few Scraps</HI> of Scripture, which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrong understood, they make the Test of Truth, and the Ground of their Principles, in Contradiction to the <HI>whole Tenour of Revelation.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6">VI. I observe once more, 'Tis very apparent, that a being <HI>born again,</HI> and <HI>spiritually raised</HI> from Death to a State of new Existence and Life, having a <HI>new Heart created in us, being renewed in the Spirit of our Mind,</HI> and being the Subjects of that Change by which we <HI>put off the old Man, and put on the new Man,</HI> is the same Thing with that which in Scripture is called a <HI>being</HI> CREATED ANEW, or made NEW CREATURES.</P>
<P>Here, to pass over many other Evidences of this, which might be mentioned, I would only observe, that the Repre∣sentations are exactly equivalent. These several Phrases naturally and most plainly signify the same Effect. In the first <HI>Birth</HI> or Generation, we are <HI>created,</HI> or brought into Existence; 'tis then the <HI>whole Man</HI> first <HI>receives Be∣ing:</HI> The Soul is then <HI>formed,</HI> and then our Bodies are <HI>fearfully and wonderfully made, being curiously wrought by our Creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r;</HI> So that a new-born Child is a <HI>new Crea∣ture.</HI> So, when a Man is <HI>born again,</HI> he is <HI>created again;</HI> in that <HI>new Birth,</HI> there is a <HI>new Creation;</HI> and therein he becomes as a <HI>new-born Babe,</HI> or a NEW CREATURE.—So, in a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> there is a <HI>new Creation.</HI> When a Man is <HI>dead,</HI> that which was created or made in the first Birth or Creation, is destroyed: When that which was dead is <HI>raised</HI> to Life, the mighty Power of the Creator or Author of Life, is exerted the second Time, and the Subject restored to new Existence, and new Life, as by a <HI>new Creation.</HI> So, giving a new Heart is called <HI>CREA∣TING a clean Heart,</HI> Psal. li. 10. Where the Word transla∣ted
<PB N="309" REF="008118_0329_0F6B586DA2C5F658"/>
<HI>create,</HI> is the same that is used in the first Verse in <HI>Genesis.</HI> And when we read in Scripture of the <HI>new Creature,</HI> the Creature that is called NEW is MAN; not Angel, or Beast, or any other Sort of Creature; and therefore the Phrase, <HI>New Man,</HI> is evidently equipollent with <HI>New Creature;</HI> and a putting off the <HI>old Man,</HI> and putting on the <HI>new Man,</HI> is spoken of expressly as brought to pass by a Work of <HI>Creation.</HI> Col. iii. 9, 10. <HI>Ye have put off the old Man—and have put on the new Man, which is re∣newed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that CREATED him.</HI> So, Eph. iv. 22, 23, 24. <HI>That ye put off the old Man, which is corrupt</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and be renewed in the spirit of your Mind,</HI> and that <HI>ye put on the new Man, which after God is CREATED in Righteousness and true Holiness.</HI>—These Things absolutely six the Meaning of that in 2 Cor. v. 17. <HI>If any Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature: Old Things are passed away; behold, all Things are become New.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, the following Reflections may be made:</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is a Truth of the utmost Certainty, with respect to <HI>every</HI> Man, born of the Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> by or∣dinary Generation, that <HI>unless he be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</HI> This is true, not only of the Heathen, but of them that are born of the professing People of God, as <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and the <HI>Jews,</HI> and every Man <HI>born of the Flesh.</HI> This is most manifest by Christ's Discourse, in <HI>Job.</HI> iii. 3,—11. So 'tis plain by 2 Cor. v. 17. That <HI>every Man who is in Christ, is a new Creature.</HI></P>
<P N="12">2. It appears from this, together with what has been proved above, that it is most certain with respect to <HI>every</HI> one of the human Race, that he can never have any In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest in Christ, or see the Kingdom of God, unless he be the Subject of that Change in the Temper and Dispositi∣on of his Heart, which is made in <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Con∣version, Circumcision of Heart, spiritual Baptism, dying to Sin and rising to a new and holy Life;</HI>—and unless he has the <HI>old Heart taken away,</HI> and <HI>a new Heart and

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Concerning that OBJECTION, That to suppose Men's being BORN IN SIN, without their Choice, or any previous Act of their own, is to suppose what is inconsistent with the Nature of SIN.</HEAD>
<P>SOme of the Objections, made against the Doctrine of original Sin, which have Reference to particular Ar∣guments used in Defence of it, have been already consider∣ed in the handling of those Arguments. What I shall therefore now consider, are such Objections as I have not yet had Occasion to take any special Notice of.</P>
<P>There is no Argument Dr. <HI>T.</HI> insists more upon, than that which is taken from the <HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Pelagian</HI> No∣tion of Freedom of Will, consisting in the Will's <HI>Self-de∣termination,</HI> as necessary to the Being of moral Good or Evil. He often urges, that if we come into the World infected with sinful and depraved Dispositions, then <HI>Sin</HI> must be <HI>natural</HI> to us; and if natural, then <HI>necessary;</HI> and if necessary, then <HI>no</HI> Sin, nor any thing we are blam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able for, or that can in any respect be our Fault, being what we can't help: and he urges, that Sin must proceed from our own <HI>Choice,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 125, 128, 129, 130, 186, 187, 188, 190, 200, 245, 246, 253, 258, 339, 340, 437, and other Places.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here I would observe in general, that the foremention'd Notion of Freedom of Will as essential to moral Agency, and necessary to the very Existence of Virtue &amp; Sin, seems
<PB N="312" REF="008118_0332_0F6B5871D2248418"/>
to be a grand favorite Point with <HI>Pelagians,</HI> &amp; <HI>Arminians,</HI> and all Divines of such Characters, in their Controversies with the Orthodox. There is no one thing more funda∣mental in their Schemes of Religion: On the Determina∣tion of this one leading Point depends the Issue of almost all Controversies we have with such Divines. Neverthe∣less, it seems a <HI>needless</HI> Task for me particularly to consider that Matter in this Place; having already largely discuss'd it, with all the main Grounds of this Notion, &amp; the Arguments used to defend it, in a late Book on this Subject, to which I ask Leave to refer the Reader.—'Tis very necessary, that the modern prevailing Doctrine concerning this Point, should be well understood, and therefore thoroughly con∣sidered and examined: For without it there is no Hope of putting an End to the Controversy about original Sin, and innumerable other Controversies that subsist, about many of the main Points of Religion. I stand ready to confess to the foremention'd modern Divines, if they can maintain their peculiar Notion of <HI>Freedom,</HI> consisting in the <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣determining Power of the Will,</HI> as necessary to <HI>moral Agency,</HI> &amp; can thoroughly establish it in Opposition to the Arguments lying against it, then they have an impregnable Castle, to which they may repair, and remain invincible, in all the Controversies they have with the reformed Di∣vines, concerning <HI>original Sin,</HI> the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of Grace, <HI>Election, Redemption, Conversion,</HI> the <HI>efficacious Opera∣tion</HI> of the Holy Spirit, the Nature of saving <HI>Faith, Per∣severance</HI> of the Saints, and other Principles of the like Kind.—However, at the same Time I think, this same Thing will be as strong a Fortress for the <HI>Deists,</HI> in common with them; as the great Doctrines, subverted by their No∣tion of <HI>Freedom,</HI> are so plainly &amp; abundantly taught in the Scripture. But I am under no Apprehensions of any Dan∣ger, the Cause of Christianity or the Religion of the Re∣formed is in, from any Possibility of <HI>that Notion's</HI> being ever established, or of it's being ever evinced, that there is not proper, perfect &amp; manifold <HI>Demonstration</HI> lying against it. But as I said, it would be needless for me to enter
<PB N="313" REF="008118_0333_0F6B58728AA1FC20"/>
into a particular Disquisition of this Point here; from which I shall easily be excused by any Reader who is willing to give himself the Trouble of consulting what I have already written: and as to others, probably they will scarce be at the Pains of reading the present Discourse; or at least would not, if it should be enlarged by a full Consideration of that Controversy.</P>
<P>I shall at this Time therefore only take Notice of some gross <HI>Inconsistencies,</HI> that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> has been guilty of, in his handling this Objection against the Doctrine of original Sin.</P>
<P>In Places which have been cited, he says, That <HI>Sin must proceed from our own Choice:</HI> and that <HI>if it does not, it being necessary to us, it cannot be Sin, it can't be our Fault, or what we are to blame for: And therefore all our Sin must be chargeable on our Choice,</HI> which is the <HI>Cause</HI> of Sin: For he says, <HI>The Cause of every Effect is alone chargeable with the Effect it produceth, and which proceedeth from it.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 125▪</NOTE>—Now here are implied several gross Contradictions. He greatly insists, that Nothing can be <HI>sinful,</HI> or have the Nature of Sin, but what proceeds from our <HI>Choice.</HI> Nevertheless, he says, Not the <HI>Effect,</HI> but the <HI>Cause</HI> alone is chargeable with <HI>Blame.</HI> There∣fore the <HI>Choice,</HI> which is the <HI>Cause,</HI> this <HI>alone</HI> is blameable, or has the Nature of Sin; and not the <HI>Effect</HI> of that Choice. Thus Nothing can be sinful, but the Effect of Choice; and yet the Effect of Choice never can be sinful, but only the <HI>Cause,</HI> which alone is chargeable with all the Blame.</P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Choice,</HI> which chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and produces Sin, or from which Sin proceeds is <HI>it self</HI> sinful. Not only is this implied in his saying, "The <HI>Cause</HI> alone is chargeable with all the <HI>Blame;"</HI> but he expresly speaks of the Choice as <HI>faulty;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 190.</NOTE> and calls that Choice <HI>wicked,</HI> from which Depravity and <HI>Corruption proceeds.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 200. See also P. 216.</NOTE> Now, if the <HI>Choice</HI> it self be <HI>Sin,</HI> and there be no Sin but what proceeds from a sinful Choice, then the sinful Choice must proceed from another <HI>antecedent</HI> Choice; It must be chosen by a fore∣going Act of Will, determining it self to that sinful
<PB N="314" REF="008118_0334_0F6B587303AB0E70"/>
Choice, that so it may have that which he speaks of as absolutely essential to the Nature of <HI>Sin,</HI> namely, <HI>That it proceed from our Choice,</HI> and don't happen to us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣cessarily.—But if the sinful Choice it self proceeds from a foregoing Choice, then also that foregoing Choice must be sinful; it being the <HI>Cause of Sin,</HI> and so alone charge∣able with the <HI>Blame.</HI> Yet if that foregoing Choice be sinful, then, neither must <HI>that</HI> happen to us necessarily, but must likewise proceed from Choice, another Act of Choice prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eding that: for we must remember, that "Nothing is sinful, but what proceeds from our <HI>Choice.</HI>" And then, for the same Reason, even this prior Choice, last mentioned, must also be sinful, being chargeable with all the Blame of that consequent evil Choice, which was it's Effect. And so we must go back till we come to the very <HI>first</HI> Volition, the prime or original Act of Choice, in the whole Chain. And <HI>this,</HI> to be sure, must be a <HI>sinful</HI> Choice, because this is the <HI>Origin</HI> or primitive <HI>Cause</HI> of all the Trail of Evils which follow; and according to our Author, must therefore be "alone chargeable with all the Blame." And yet so it is, according to him, <HI>this</HI> "can∣not be sinful," because it don't "proceed from our own Choice," or any foregoing Act of our Will; it being, by the Supposition, the very <HI>first</HI> Act of Will in the Case. And therefore it must be <HI>necessary,</HI> as to us, having no Choice of ours to be the Cause of it.</P>
<P>In Page 232, he says, <Q><HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin was from his own <HI>disobedient Will;</HI> and so must every Man's Sin, and all the Sin in the World, as well as his.</Q>—By this, it seems, he must have a "disobedient Will" <HI>before</HI> he sins; for the Cause must be before the Effect: and yet that dis∣obedient Will itself is <HI>sinful;</HI> otherwise it could not be called <HI>disobedient.</HI> But the Question is, How do Men come by the <HI>disobedient Will,</HI> this Cause of all the Sin in the World? It must not come <HI>necessarily,</HI> without Men's Choice: for if so, 'tis <HI>not</HI> Sin, nor is there any <HI>Disobedience</HI> in it. Therefore that disobedient Will must also come from a <HI>disobedient Will;</HI> and so on, <HI>in infinitum.</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="008118_0335_0F6B5873D81B5748"/>
Otherwise, it must be supposed, that there is some <HI>Sin</HI> in the World, which don't come from a <HI>disobedient Will;</HI> contrary to our Author's dogmatical Assertions.</P>
<P>In P. 442. He says, "Adam <HI>could not sin without a sinful Inclination."</HI>—Here he calls that Inclination it self <HI>sinful,</HI> which is the Principle from whence sinful Acts pro∣ceed; as elsewhere he speaks of the <HI>disobedient Will,</HI> from whence all Sin comes: And he allows, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contents of Rom. Chap. vii. in Notes on the Epistle.</NOTE> that <Q>the <HI>Law</HI> reaches to all the <HI>latent Principles</HI> of Sin;</Q> mean∣ing plainly, that it <HI>forbids,</HI> and <HI>threatens Punishment</HI> for those latent Principles. Now these latent Principles of Sin, these sinful Inclinations, without which, according to our Author, there can be no sinful Act, can't all proceed from a <HI>sinful Choice;</HI> because that would imply great Contradiction. For, by the Supposition, they are the Principles from whence a sinful Choice comes, and whence all sinful Acts of Will proceed; and there can be no sin∣ful Act without 'em. So that the <HI>first</HI> latent Principles, and Inclinations, from whence all sinful Acts proceed, are <HI>sinful;</HI> and yet they are <HI>not</HI> sinful, because they don't proceed from a <HI>wicked Choice,</HI> without which, according to him, "Nothing can be sinful."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> speaking of that Proposition of the <HI>Assembly of Divines,</HI> wherein they assert, that<HI>Man is by Nature ut∣terly corrupt, &amp;c.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 125.</NOTE> thinks himself well warranted by the supposed great Evidence of these his contradictory Noti∣ons, to say, <Q>Therefore Sin is not natural to us; and therefore I shall not scruple to say, this Proposition in the <HI>Assembly of Divines</HI> is FALSE.</Q>—But it may be worthy to be considered, whether it would not have great∣ly become him, before he had cloathed himself with so much Assurance, and proceeded, on the Foundation of these his Notions, so magisterially to charge the <HI>Assembly's</HI> Proposition with <HI>Falshood,</HI> to have taken Care, that his own Propositions, which he has set in Opposition to them, should be a little more <HI>consistent;</HI> that he might not have
<PB N="316" REF="008118_0336_0F6B58748C59C610"/>
contradicted <HI>himself,</HI> while contradicting them; left some impartial Judges, observing his Inconsistence, should think they had Warrant to declare with equal Assurance, that <Q>They shall not scruple to say, Dr. <HI>T—r's</HI> Doctrine is FALSE.</Q></P>

<HEAD>Concerning that Objection against the Doctrine of native Corruption, That to suppose Men re∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive their first Existence in Sin, is to make Him who is the Author of their Being, the Author of their Depravity.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Argument against Men's being supposed to be born with sinful Depravity, which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> greatly insists upon, is, "That this does in Effect charge Him who is <HI>the Author of our Nature, who formed us in the Womb,</HI> with being <HI>the Author of a sinful Corruption of Nature;</HI> and that it is <HI>highly injurious</HI> to the God of our Nature, <HI>whose Hands have formed and fashioned us,</HI> to believe <HI>our Nature</HI> to be <HI>originally corrupted,</HI> and <HI>that in the</HI> worst <HI>Sense of Corruption.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 137. 187, 188, 189, 256, 258, 260, 419, 424, and other Places.</NOTE></P>
<P>With respect to this, I would observe in the first Place, that this Writer, in his handling this grand Objection, sup∣poses something to <HI>belong</HI> to the Doctrine objected against, as maintained by the Divines whom he is opposing, which does <HI>not</HI> belong to it, nor does follow from it: As parti∣cularly, he supposes the Doctrine of original Sin to imply, that Nature must be corrupted by some <HI>positive Influence;</HI> <Q>something, by some Means or other, <HI>infused</HI> into the human Nature; some <HI>Quality</HI> or other, not from the <HI>Choice</HI> of our Minds, but like a <HI>Taint, Tincture,</HI> or <HI>Infection,</HI> altering the natural Constitution, Faculties&amp; Dis∣positions of our Souls.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 187.</NOTE> That Sin and evil Dispositions

In order to account for a sinful Corruption of Nature, yea, a total native Depravity of the Heart of Man, there is not the least Need of supposing any evil Quality <HI>infused, implanted,</HI> or <HI>wrought</HI> into the Nature of Man, by any <HI>positive</HI> Cause, or Influence whatsoever, either from God, or the Creature; or of supposing, that Man is conceived and born with a <HI>Fountain of Evil</HI> in his Heart, such as is any thing properly <HI>positive.</HI> I think, a little Attention to the Nature of Things will be sufficient to satisfy any impartial considerate Inquirer, that the Absence of positive good Principles, and so the With holding of a special divine Influence to impart and maintain those good Principles, leaving the common natural Principles of Self∣love, natural Appetite, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which were in Man in Inno∣cence) leaving these, I say, to themselves, without the Government of superiour divine Principles, will certainly be followed with the Corruption, yea, the total Corrup∣tion of the Heart, without Occasion for any positive In∣fluence at all: And, that it was thus indeed that Corrup∣tion of Nature came on <HI>Adam,</HI> immediately on his Fall, and comes on all his Posterity, as sinning in him and falling with him.</P>
<P>The Case with Man was plainly this: When God made Man at first, he implanted in him two Kinds of Princi∣ples. There was an <HI>inferiour</HI> Kind, which may be called NATURAL being the Principles of meer human Nature; such as Self-love, with those natural Appetites &amp; Passions, which belong to the <HI>Nature of Man,</HI> in which his Love to his own Liberty, Honour and Pleasure, were exer∣cised: These, when alone, and left to themselves, are what the Scriptures sometimes call FLESH. Besides these, there were <HI>superiour</HI> Principles, that were spiritual, holy and divine summarily comprehended in divine Love; wherein consisted the spiritual Image of God, and Man's
<PB N="318" REF="008118_0338_0F6B587601210C18"/>
Righteousness and true Holiness; which are called in Scripture the <HI>Divine Nature.</HI> These Principles may, in some Sense, be called SUPER NATURAL, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To prevent all Cavils, the Reader is desired particularly to observe, in what Sense I here use the Words, <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Supernatural:</HI>—Not as Epithets of Distinction between that which is Concreated or Connate, and that which is extra∣ordinarily introduced afterwards, besides the first State of Things, or the Order established originally, beginning when Man's Nature began;—but as distinguishing between what belongs <HI>to,</HI> or flows <HI>from,</HI> that Nature which Man has, mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <HI>as</HI> Man, and those things which are <HI>above</HI> this,—by which one is denominated, not only a <HI>Man,</HI> but a truly <HI>virtuous, holy,</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> Man; which, tho' they began, in <HI>Adam,</HI> as soon as Humanity began, and are necessary to the Per∣fection and Well-being of the human Nature, yet are not essential to the Constitution of it, or necessary to it's Being: inasmuch as one may have every Thing needful to his being <HI>Man,</HI> exclusively of them.—If in thus using the Words, <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Supernatural,</HI> I use them in an uncommon Sense, 'tis not from any Affectation of Singularity, but for Want of other Terms, more aptly to express my Meaning.</NOTE> being (however concreated or connate, yet) such as are <HI>above</HI> those Principles that are essentially implied in, or necessa∣rily resulting from, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eperably connected with, <HI>meer human Nature;</HI> and being such as immediately depend on Man's Union and Communion with God, or Divine Com∣munications and Influences of God's Spirit: Which tho withdrawn, and Man's Nature forsaken of these Principles, human Nature would be human Nature still; Mans Na∣ture, as such, being intire without these Divine <HI>Principles;</HI> which the Scripture sometimes calls SPIRIT, in Contra∣distinction to <HI>Flesh.</HI> These superiour Principles were gi∣ven to possess the Throne, and maintain an absolute Do∣minion in the Heart: the other, to be wholly subordi∣nate and subservient. And while Things continued thus, all Things were in excellent Order, Peace and beautiful Harmony, and in their proper and perfect State. These divine Principles thus reigning, were the Dignity, Life, Happiness, and Glory of Man's Nature.—When Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd,
<PB N="319" REF="008118_0339_0F6B5876C1019D38"/>
and broke God's Covenant, and fell under his Curse, these superiour Principles left his Heart: for indeed God then left him; that Communion with God, on which these Principles depended, intirely ceased; the Holy Spirit, that divine Inhabitant, forsook the House. Because it would have been utterly improper in it self, and inconsistent with the Covenant &amp; Constitution God had established, that God should still maintain Communion with Man, and continue, by his friendly, gracious vital Influences, to dwell with him and in him, after he was become a Rebel, and had incur'd God's Wrath and Curse. Therefore immediately the superiour divine Principles wholly ceased; so Light ceases in a Room, when the Candle is withdrawn: and thus Man was left in a State of Darkness, woful Corruption and Ruin; Nothing but <HI>Flesh,</HI> without <HI>Spirit.</HI> The inferiour Principles of Self-love and natural Appetite, which were given only to serve, being alone, &amp; left to themselves, <HI>of Course</HI> became reigning Principles; having no superiour Principles to regulate or controul them, they became ab∣solute Masters of the Heart. The immediate Conse∣quence of which was a <HI>fatal Catastrophe,</HI> a turning of all Things upside down, and the Succession of a State of the most odious &amp; dreadful Confusion. Man did immedi∣ately set up <HI>himself,</HI> and the Objects of his private Affecti∣ons and Appetites, as supream; and so they took the Place of GOD.—These inferiour Principles are like <HI>Fire</HI> in an House; which, we say, is a good Servant, but a bad Master; very useful while kept in it's Place, but if left to take Possession of the whole House, soon brings all to Destruction. Man's Love to his own Honour, separate Interest, and private Pleasure, which before was wholly subordinate unto Love to God &amp; Regard to his Authority and Glory, now dispose and impel Man to pursue those Objects, without Regard to God's Honour, or Law; be∣cause there is no true Regard to these divine Things left in him. In Consequence of which, he seeks those Objects as much when against God's Honour and Law, as when agreable to 'em. And God still continuing strictly to

require supr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m Regard to himself, and forbidding all Gratifications of these inferiour Passions, but only in per∣fect Subordination to the Ends, &amp; Agreableness to the Rules and Limits, which his Holiness, Honour &amp; Law prescribe, hence immediately arises <HI>Enmity</HI> in the Heart, now wholly under the Power of Self-love; and Nothing but <HI>War</HI> en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues, in a constant Course, against God. As, when a Subject has once renounced his lawful Sovereign, and set up a Pretender in his Stead, a State of Enmity and War against his rightful King necessarily ensues.—It were easy to shew, how every Lust &amp; depraved Disposition of Man's Heart would naturally arise from this <HI>privative</HI> Original, if here were Room for it. Thus 'tis easy to give an Ac∣count, how total Corruption of Heart should follow on Man's eating the forbidden Fruit, thô that was but one Act of Sin, <HI>without God's putting</HI> any Evil into his Heart, or <HI>implanting</HI> any bad Principle, or <HI>infusing</HI> any corrupt Taint, and so becoming the <HI>Author</HI> of Depravity. Only God's <HI>Withdrawing,</HI> as it was highly proper and necessary that he should, from Rebel-Man, being as it were driven away by his abominable Wickedness, and Men's <HI>natural</HI> Principles being <HI>left to themselves,</HI> this is sufficient to account for his becoming intirely corrupt, and bent on sinning against God.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Adam'</HI>s Nature became corrupt, without God's implanting or infusing any evil Thing into his Nature; so does the Nature of his <HI>Posterity.</HI> God dealing with <HI>Adam</HI> as the Head of his Posterity (as has been shewn) and treating them as One, he deals with his Posterity as having <HI>all sinned in him.</HI> And therefore, as God with∣drew spiritual Communion and his vital gracious Influ∣ence from the common Head, so he with-holds the same from all the Members, as they come into Existence; where∣by they come into the World meer <HI>Flesh▪</HI> and entirely under the Government of natural and inferiour Principles; and so become wholly corrupt, as <HI>Adam</HI> did.</P>
<P>Now, for God so far to have the Disposal of this Affair, as to <HI>with-hold</HI> those Influences, without which <HI>Nature</HI>

There∣fore, to explain the Continuance of the Habits of Sin in the same Person, when once introduced, yea, to explain the very Being of any such Habits, in Consequence of repeat∣ed Acts, our Author must have Recourse to those same Principles, which he rejects as absurd to the utmost Degree, when alledged to explain the Corruption of Nature in the Posterity of <HI>Adam.</HI> For, that Habits, either good or bad, should <HI>continue</HI> after being once established, or that Ha∣bits should be settled and have Existence, in Consequence of repeated Acts, can be owing only to <HI>a Course of Na∣ture,</HI> and those <HI>Laws of Nature</HI> which God has established.</P>
<P>That the Posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> should be born without Holiness, and so with a depraved Nature, comes to pass as much by the <HI>established Course of Nature,</HI> as the Con∣tinuance of a corrupt Disposition in a particular Person, after he once has it; or as much as <HI>Adam'</HI>s continuing un∣holy and corrupt, after he had once lost his Holiness.

Course of Nature is demonstrated, by late Improvements in Philosophy, to be indeed what our Author himself says it is, <HI>viz.</HI> Nothing but the established Order of the Agency and Operation of the Author of Nature. And thô there be the immediate Agency of God in bring∣ing the Soul into Existence in Generation, yet 'tis done according to the Method and Order established by the Author of Nature, as much as his producing the Bud, or the Acorn of the Oak; and as much as his continuing a particular Person in Being, after he once has Existence. God's immediate Agency in bringing the Soul of a Child into Being, is as much according to an <HI>established Order,</HI> as his immediate Agency in any of the Works of Nature whatsoever. 'Tis agreable to the established Order of Nature, that the good Qualities wanting in the <HI>Tree,</HI> should also be wanting in the <HI>Branches</HI> and <HI>Fruit.</HI> 'Tis agreable to the Order of Nature; that when a particular Person is without good moral Qualities in his Heart, he should continue without 'em, till some new Cause or Efficiency produces them: And 'tis as much agreable to an established Course and Order of Nature, that since <HI>Adam,</HI> the Head of the Race of Mankind, the Root of that great Tree with many Branches springing from it, was deprived of original Righteousness, the Branches should come forth without it. Or, if any dislike the Word, <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> as used in this last Case, and in Stead of it c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use to call it a <HI>Constitution,</HI> or <HI>established Order</HI> of successive Events, the Alteration of the Name won't in the least al∣ter the State of the present Argument. Where the Name, <HI>Nature,</HI> is allowed without Dispute, no more is meant than an established Method and Order of Events, settled and limited by divine Wisdom.</P>
<P>If any should object to this, That if the Want of ori∣ginal Righteousness be thus according to an established Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> then why are not Principles of Holi∣ness▪ when restored by divine <HI>Grace,</HI> also communicated to <HI>Posterity?</HI> I answer, The divine Laws and Establish∣ments
<PB N="324" REF="008118_0344_0F6B587BB03191F8"/>
of the Author of <HI>Nature</HI> are precisely settled by him, as he pleaseth, and limited by his Wisdom.—<HI>Grace</HI> is introduced among the Race of Mankind by a <HI>new Establishment;</HI> not on the Foot of the original Establish∣ment of God, as the Head of the natural World, and Au∣thor of the first Creation; but by a Constitution of a vast∣ly higher Kind; wherein <HI>Christ</HI> is made the <HI>Root</HI> of the Tree, whose Branches are his spiritual <HI>Seed</HI> and He is the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>new Creation;</HI> of which I need not stand now to speak particularly.</P>
<P>But here I desire it may be noted, that I don't suppose, the natural Depravity of the Posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> is owing to the Course of Nature only; 'tis also owing to the just <HI>Judgment</HI> of God. But yet I think, it is as truly, and in the same Manner, owing to the Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> that <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity come into the World without original Righteousness, as that <HI>Adam</HI> continued without it, after he had once lost it.—That <HI>Adam</HI> continued destitute of Holiness, when he had lost it, and would always have so continued, had it not been restored by a Redeemer, was not only a <HI>natural</HI> Consequence, according to the Course of Things established by God, as the Author of Nature; but it was also a <HI>penal</HI> Consequence, or a Punishment of his Sin. God, in righteous <HI>Judgment,</HI> continued to absent himself from <HI>Adam,</HI> after he became a Rebel; and with∣held from him now those Influences of the holy Spirit, which he before had. And just thus, I suppose it to be with every natural Branch of Mankind: all are looked upon as <HI>sin∣ning</HI> in and with their common Root; and God righteously with-holds special Influences &amp; spiritual Communications from all. for this Sin.—But of the Manner and Order of these Things, more may be said in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>On the whole, this grand Objection against the Doctrine of Men's being born corrupt, That it makes Him who <HI>gave us our Being,</HI> to be the Cause of the <HI>Being of Cor∣ruption,</HI> can have no more Force in it, than a like Argu∣ment has to prove, that if Men by a Course of Nature <HI>continue</HI> Wicked, or remain without Goodness, after they
<PB N="325" REF="008118_0345_0F6B587DAA30B090"/>
have by vicious Acts contracted vicious Habits, and so made themselves wicked, it makes Him who is <HI>the Cause of their</HI> Continuance <HI>in Being,</HI> and <HI>the Cause of the</HI> Continuance <HI>of the Course of Nature,</HI> to be <HI>the Cause of their</HI> conti∣nued <HI>Wickedness.</HI> Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 412.</NOTE> <Q>God would not <HI>make</HI> any thing that is <HI>hateful</HI> to him; because, by the very Terms, He would <HI>hate to make</HI> such a Thing.</Q> But if this be good arguing in the Case to which it is applied, may I not as well say, <HI>God would not</HI> continue <HI>a Thing in Being that is</HI> hateful <HI>to him; because, by the very Terms, he would</HI> hate to continue <HI>such a Thing in Being?</HI> I think, the very Terms do as much (and no more) infer one of these Propositions, as the other.—In like Manner, the rest that he says on that Head, may be shewn to be un∣reasonable, by only substituting the Word, <HI>continue,</HI> in the Place of, <HI>make</HI> and <HI>propagate.</HI> I may fairly imitate his way of Reasoning, thus: <Q>To say, God <HI>continues</HI> us according to his own original Decree, or Law of <HI>Continu∣ation,</HI> which obliges him to <HI>continue</HI> us in a Manner he abhors, is really to make bad worse: for it is supposing him to be defective in Wisdom, or by his own Decree or Law to lay such a Constraint upon his own Acti∣ons, that he cannot do what he would; but is continu∣ally doing what he would not, what he hates to do, and what he condemns in <HI>us;</HI> viz. <HI>continuing</HI> us sinful, when he condemns us for <HI>continuing</HI> our selves sinful.</Q>—If the Reasoning be <HI>weak</HI> in the one Case, it's no less so in the other.</P>
<P>If any shall still insist, That there is a <HI>Difference,</HI> be∣tween God's so disposing Things as that Depravity of Heart shall be <HI>continued,</HI> according to the settled Course of Nature, in the same Person, who has by his own Fault introduced it,—and his so disposing as that Men, accord∣ing to a Course of Nature, should be <HI>born</HI> with Depra∣vity, in Consequence of <HI>Adam's</HI> introducing Sin, by his Act, which we had no Concern in, and cannot be justly charged
<PB N="326" REF="008118_0346_0F6B587E5B926D08"/>
with: On this I would observe, that it is quite going off the Objection, which we have been upon, from God's Agency, and flying to another. It is then no longer in∣sisted on, that <HI>simply</HI> for him, from whose Agency the Course of Nature and our Existence derive, so to dispose Things, as that we should have Existence in a corrupt State, is for him to be the Author of Sin: But the Plea now advanced is, That it is not proper and just for such an Agent so to dispose <HI>in this Case,</HI> and only in Consequence of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin; it not being just to charge <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin to his Posterity. And this Matter shall be particularly con∣sidered, in Answer to the next Objection; to which I now proceed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>That great Objection against the Imputation of Adam's Sin to his Posterity, considered, That such Imputation is unjust and unreasonable, inas∣much as Adam and his Posterity are not one and the same. With a brief Reflection subjoined, on what some have supposed, of God's imputing the Guilt of Adam's Sin to his Posterity, but in an infinitely less Degree, than to Adam himself.</HEAD>
<P>THat we may proceed with the greater Clearness in considering the main Objections against supposing the Guilt of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin to be imputed to his Posterity, I would premise some Observations with a View to the right <HI>Stating</HI> of the Doctrine of the Imputation of <HI>Adam's</HI> first Sin; and then shew the <HI>Reasonableness</HI> of this Doct∣rine, in Opposition to the great Clamour raised against it on this Head.</P>
<P>I think, it would go far towards directing us to the more clear and distinct conceiving and right stating of this Affair, if we steadily bear this in Mind; That God, in each Step
<PB N="327" REF="008118_0347_0F6B587F0AAF6D88"/> 
of his Proceeding with <HI>Adam,</HI> in Relation to the Covenant or Constitution established with him, look'd on his Poste∣rity as being <HI>One with him.</HI> (The Propriety of his looking upon them so, I shall speak to afterwards) And tho' he dealt more immediately with <HI>Adam,</HI> yet it was as the <HI>Head</HI> of the whole Body, &amp; the <HI>Root</HI> of the whole Tree; and in his Proceedings with him, he dealt with all the Branches, as if they had been then existing in their Root.</P>
<P>From which it will follow, that both Guilt, or Exposed∣ness to Punishment, and also Depravity of Heart, came upon <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity just as they came upon him, as much as if he &amp; they had all co-existed, like a Tree with many Branches; allowing only for the Difference necessa∣rily resulting from the Place <HI>Adam</HI> stood in, as Head or Root of the whole, and being first and most immediately dealt with, &amp; most immediately acting &amp; suffering. Other∣wise, it is as if, in every Step of Proceeding, every Alte∣ration in the Root had been attended, at the same Instant, with the same Steps and Alterations throughout the whole Tree, in each individual Branch. I think, this will natu∣rally follow on the Supposition of there being a constituted <HI>Oneness</HI> or <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity in this Affair.</P>
<P>Therefore I am humbly of Opinion, that if any have supposed the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> to come into the World with a <HI>double Guilt,</HI> one the Guilt of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, another the Guilt arising from their having a corrupt Heart, they have not so well conceived of the Matter. The <HI>Guilt</HI> a Man has upon his Soul at his first Existence, is one and simple; <HI>viz.</HI> the Guilt of the original Apostacy, the Guilt of the Sin by which the Species first rebelled against God. This, and the Guilt arising from the first Corruption or depraved Disposition of the Heart, are not to be look'd upon as <HI>two</HI> things, <HI>distinctly</HI> imputed and charged upon Men in the Sight of God. Indeed the Guilt, that arises from the Corruption of the Heart, as it remains a confirmed Principle, and appears in it's consequent Operations, is a <HI>distinct</HI> and <HI>additional</HI> Guilt: but the Guilt arising from
<PB N="328" REF="008118_0348_0F6B587FC19A6680"/>
the first existing of a depraved Disposition in <HI>Adam'</HI>s Poste∣rity, I apprehend, is <HI>not</HI> distinct from their Guilt of <HI>Adam'</HI>s first Sin. For so it was not in <HI>Adam</HI> himself. The first evil Disposition or Inclination of the Heart of <HI>Adam</HI> to Sin, was not properly distinct from his first Act of Sin, but was included in it. The external Act he committed was no otherwise his, than as his Heart was in it, or as that Action proceeded from the wicked Inclination of his Heart. Nor was the Guilt he had, <HI>double,</HI> as for two distinct Sins: One, the Wickedness of his Heart and Will in that Affair; another, the Wickedness of the external Act, caused by his Heart. His Guilt was all truly from the Act of his inward Man; exclusive of which the Motions of his Body were no more than the Motions of any lifeless Instrument. His Sin consisted in Wickedness of Heart, fully sufficient <HI>for,</HI> and intirely amounting <HI>to,</HI> all that appeared in the Act he committed.</P>
<P>The depraved Disposition of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Heart is to be con∣sidered two Ways. (1.) As the first rising of an evil Incli∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion in his Heart, exerted in his first Act of Sin, and the Ground of the compleat Transgression. (2.) An evil Disposition of Heart continuing afterwards, as a confirmed Principle, that came by God's forsaking him; which was a <HI>Punishment</HI> of his first Transgression. This confirmed Corruption, by it's remaining and continued Operation, brought additional Guilt on his Soul.</P>
<P>And in like Manner, Depravity of Heart is to be con∣sidered two Ways in <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity. The <HI>first Ex∣isting</HI> of a corrupt Disposition in their Hearts is not to be look'd upon as Sin belonging to them, <HI>distinct</HI> from their Participation of <HI>Adam'</HI>s first Sin: it is as it were the <HI>ex∣tended Pollution</HI> of that Sin, through the whole Tree, by Virtue of the constituted <HI>Union</HI> of the Branches with the Root; or the <HI>Inherence</HI> of the Sin of that Head of the Species in the Members, in the Consent and Concurrence of the Hearts of the Members with the Head, in that first Act. (Which may be, without God's being the Author of Sin: about which I have spoken in the former Chapter.)
<PB N="329" REF="008118_0349_0F6B58808C9D3B98"/>
But the Depravity of Nature, remaining an <HI>established Principle</HI> in the Heart of a Child of <HI>Adam,</HI> and as ex∣hibited in After-Operations, is a <HI>Consequence</HI> and <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> of the first Apostacy thus participated, and brings new Guilt.—The first Being of an evil Disposition in the Heart of a Child of <HI>Adam,</HI> whereby he is disposed to <HI>ap∣prove</HI> of the Sin of his first Father, as fully as he him∣self approved of it when he committed it, or so far as to imply a full and perfect <HI>Consent</HI> of Heart to it, I think, is not to be look'd upon as a Consequence of the Impu∣tation of that first Sin, any more than the full Consent of <HI>Adam'</HI>s own Heart in the Act of sinning; which was not consequent on the Imputation of his Sin to himself, but ra∣ther <HI>prior</HI> to it in the Order of Nature. Indeed the Deri∣vation of the evil Disposition to the Hearts of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, or rather the <HI>Co-existence</HI> of the evil Disposition, implied in <HI>Adam'</HI>s first Rebellion, in the <HI>Root</HI> &amp; <HI>Branches,</HI> is a Consequence of the <HI>Union,</HI> that the wise Author of the World has established between <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; his Posterity; but not properly a <HI>Consequence</HI> of the <HI>Imputation</HI> of his Sin; nay rather <HI>antecedent</HI> to it, as it was in <HI>Adam</HI> him∣self. The first Depravity of Heart, and the Imputation of that Sin, are both the Consequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of that established Union; but yet in such Order, that the evil Disposition is <HI>first,</HI> and the Charge of Guilt <HI>consequent;</HI> as it was in the Case of <HI>Adam</HI> himself.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>My Meaning, in the whole of what has been here said, may be illustrated thus: Let us suppose, that <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Posterity had <HI>co-existed,</HI> and that his Posterity had been, thrô a Law of Nature established by the Creator, <HI>united</HI> to him, something as the Branches of a Tree are united to the Root, or the Members of the Body to the Head; so as to constitute as it were <HI>one</HI> complex Person, or <HI>one</HI> moral Whole: So that by the Law of Union there should have been a <HI>Communion</HI> and <HI>Co-existence</HI> in Acts &amp; Affections; all jointly participating, and all concurring, as <HI>one Whole,</HI> in the Disposition &amp; Action of the Head: as we see in the Body natural, the whole Body is affected as the Head is affected; and the whole Body con∣curs when the Head acts. Now, in this Case, the Hearts of all the Branches of Mankind, by the Constitution of Na∣ture and Law of Union, would have been affected just as the Heart of <HI>Adam,</HI> their common Root, was affected. When the Heart of the Root, by a full Disposition committed the first Sin, the Hearts of all the Branches would have con∣curred; and when the Root, in Consequence of this, be∣came guilty, so would all the Branches; and when the Heart of the Root, as a Punishment of the Sin committed, was forsaken of God, in like Manner would it have faired with all the Branches; and when the Heart of the Root, in Con∣sequence of this, was confirmed in permanent Depravity, the Case would have been the same with all the Branches; and as new Guilt on the Soul of <HI>Adam</HI> would have been con∣sequent on this, so also would it have been with his moral Branches. And thus all Things, with Relation to evil Dis∣position, Guilt, Pollution and Depravity, would exist, in the same Order and Dependence, in each Branch, as in the Root. Now, Difference of the <HI>Time</HI> of Existence don't at all hinder Things succeeding in the same Order, any more than Difference of <HI>Place</HI> in a Co-existence of Time.</P>
<P>Here may be worthy to be observed, as in several Respects to the present Purpose, some Things that are said by <HI>Stapferus,</HI> an eminent Divine of <HI>Zurich</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> in his <HI>Theologia Polemica,</HI> published about fourteen Years ago;—in <HI>English</HI> as follows. <Q>Seeing all <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity are derived from their first Parent, as their Root, the whole of the human Kind, with it's Root, may be considered as constituting but one Whole, or one Mass; so as not to be properly a Thing distinct from it's Root; the Posterity not differing from it, any otherwise than the Branches from the Tree. From which it easily appears, how that when the Root sin'd, all that which is derived from it, and with it constitutes but one Whole, may be looked upon as also sinning; seeing it is not distinct from the Root, but is one with it.</Q>—<HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> I. Chap. III. §. 856, 57.</P>
<P><Q>Tis objected, against the Imputation of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, that we never committed the same Sin with <HI>Adam,</HI> neither in Number nor in Kind. I answer, we should distinguish here between the <HI>Physical Act</HI> it self, which <HI>Adam</HI> commit∣ted, and the <HI>Morality</HI> of the Action, and <HI>Consent</HI> to it. If we have respect only to the external Act, to be sure it must be confess'd, that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity did not put forth their Hands to the forbidden Fruit: In which Sense, that Act of Transgression, and that Fall of <HI>Adam</HI> cannot be <HI>physically</HI> one with the Sin of his Posterity. But if we consider the <HI>Morality</HI> of the Action, and what <HI>Consent</HI> there is to it, it is altogether to be maintain'd, that his Posterity committed the <HI>same</HI> Sin, both in Number &amp; in Kind, inas∣much as they are to be look'd upon as consenting to it. For where there is Consent to a Sin, there the same Sin is committed. Seeing therefore that <HI>Adam</HI> with all his Posterity constitute but <HI>one moral Person,</HI> and are united in the same Covenant, &amp; are Transgressors of the same Law, they are also to be look'd upon as having, in a moral Esti∣mation, committed the same Transgression of the Law, both in Number and in Kind. Therefore this Reasoning avails nothing against the righteous Imputation of the Sin of <HI>A∣dam</HI> to all Mankind, or to the whole moral Person that is consenting to it. And for the Reason mention'd, we may rather argue thus; The Sin of the Posterity, on Account of their Consent, and the moral View in which they are to be taken, is the same with the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> not only in Kind, but in Number; therefore the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> is right∣fully imputed to his Posterity.</Q>—<HI>Id.</HI> Tom. iv. Cap. 16. §. 60, 61.</P>
<P><Q>The Imputation of <HI>Adam's</HI> first Sin consists in Nothing else than this, that his Posterity are view'd as in the same Place with their Father, and are like him. But seeing, agreable to what we have already proved, God might, according to his own righteous Judgment, which was founded on his most righteous Law, give <HI>Adam</HI> a Posterity that were <HI>like himself;</HI> and indeed it could not be otherwise, according to the very Laws of Nature; therefore he might also in righteous Judgment impute <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin to them: inasmuch as to give <HI>Adam</HI> a Posterity <HI>like himself,</HI> and to <HI>impute</HI> his Sin to them, is one and the same Thing. And therefore if the former be not contrary to the divine Per∣fections, so neither is the latter.—Our <HI>Adversaries</HI> contend with us chiefly on this Account, That according to our Doctrine of original Sin, such an <HI>Imputation</HI> of the first Sin is maintained, whereby God, without any Regard to uni∣versal native <HI>Corruption,</HI> esteems all <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity as <HI>guilty,</HI> and holds them as liable to Condemnation, <HI>purely</HI> on Account of that sinful Act of their first Parent; so that They, without any Respect had to <HI>their own Sin,</HI> and so, as <HI>innocent</HI> in themselves, are destin'd to eternal Punish∣ment.—I have therefore ever been careful to shew, that they do <HI>injuriously</HI> suppose those things to be <HI>separated,</HI> in our Doctrine, which are <HI>by no Means</HI> to be separated. The whole of the Controversy they have with us about this Matter, evidently arises from this, That they suppose the <HI>mediate</HI> and the <HI>immediate</HI> Imputation are distinguished one from the other, not only in the Manner of Conception, but in Reality. And so indeed they consider Imputation only as <HI>immediate,</HI> and abstractly from the <HI>mediate;</HI> when yet our Divines suppose, that neither ought to be considered <HI>separately</HI> from the other. Therefore I chose not to use any such Distinction, or to suppose any such Thing, in what I've said on the Subject; but only have endeavoured to explain the Thing it self, and to reconcile it with the divine Attributes. And therefore I have every where <HI>conjoined</HI> both these Conceptions concerning the Imputati∣on of the first Sin, as inseparable; and judged, that one ought never to be considered without the other.—While I have been writing this Note, I consulted all the Systems of Divinity, which I have by me, that I might see what was the true and genuine Opinion of our chief Divines in this Affair; and I found that they were of the same Mind with Me; namely, That these two Kinds of Im∣putation are by no Means to be separated, or to be con∣sidered abstractly one from the other, but that one does involve the other.</Q>—He there particularly cites those two famous reformed Divines, <HI>Vitring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Lampius.</HI>—Tom. iv.

of one Individual among all the natural Descendents of <HI>Adam,</HI> as makes it apparent, that God actually deals with <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity as <HI>One,</HI> in the Affair of his Apostacy, and it's infinitely terrible Consequences. It has been demonstrated, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hewn to be in Effect plainly acknowledged, that every Individual of Mankind comes into the World in such Circumstances, as that there is no Hope or Possibility of any other than their violating God's holy Law (if they ever live to act at all, as moral Agents) and being thereby justly exposed to eternal Ruin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part I. Chap. I. the three first Sections.</NOTE> And it is thus by God's ordering and disposing of Things. And God either thus deals with Mankind, because he looks upon them as <HI>one</HI> with their first Father, and so treats them as <HI>sinful</HI> and <HI>guilty</HI> by his Apostacy; or (which won't mend the Matter) He, <HI>without</HI> viewing them as at all concerned in that Affair, but as in every Respect per∣fectly <HI>innocent,</HI> does nevertheless subject them to this in∣finitely dreadful Calamity. <HI>Adam</HI> by his Sin was exposed to the <HI>Calamities &amp;Sorrows of this Life,</HI> to <HI>temporal Death, and eternal Ruin;</HI> as is confess'd. And 'tis also in Effect confess'd, that all his Posterity come into the World in such a State, as that the certain Consequence is their being <HI>exposed,</HI> and <HI>justly</HI> so, to the <HI>Sorrows of this Life,</HI> to <HI>temporal Death, and eternal Ruin,</HI> unless saved by Grace. So that we see, God in Fact deals with them together, or as <HI>one.</HI> If God orders the Consequences of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, with regard to his Posterity's Welfare, even in those things which are most important, and which do in the highest Degree concern their eternal Interest, to be the <HI>same</HI> with the Consequences to <HI>Adam</HI> himself, then he treats <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity as in that Affair <HI>one.</HI> Hence, however the Matter be attended with Difficulty, <HI>Fact</HI> obliges us to <HI>get over</HI> the Difficulty, either by finding out some Solution, or by shutting our Mouths, and acknowledging the Weak∣ness and Scantiness of our Understandings; as we must in innumerable other Cases, where apparent and undeniable

<HI>Fact,</HI> in God's Works of Creation and Providence, is at∣tended with Events and Circumstances, the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> of which are difficult to our Understandings,—But to proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. We will consider the <HI>Difficulties</HI> themselves, in∣sisted on in the Objections of our Opposers. They may: be reduced to these two; <HI>First,</HI> That such a Constituti∣on is <HI>injurious</HI> to <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is altogether <HI>improper,</HI> as it implies <HI>Falshood;</HI> viewing and treating those as one, which indeed are not one, but intirely <HI>distinct.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST <HI>Difficulty,</HI> That the appointing <HI>Adam</HI> to stand, in this great Affair, as the moral <HI>Head</HI> of his Poste∣rity, and so treating them as <HI>one</HI> with him, as standing or falling with him, is <HI>injurious</HI> to them, and tends to their Hurt. To which I answer, It is demonstrably <HI>other∣wise;</HI> that such a Constitution was so far from being <HI>in∣jurious</HI> and hurtful to <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity, or tending to their Calamity, any more than if every one had been ap∣pointed to stand for himself personally, that it was, in it self considered, very much of a <HI>contrary</HI> Tendency, and was attended with a more eligible <HI>Probability</HI> of an <HI>happy</HI> Issue, than the latter would have been: and so is a Con∣stitution truly expressing the <HI>Goodness</HI> of it's Author. For, here the following Things are to be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis reasonable to suppose, that <HI>Adam</HI> was <HI>as likely,</HI> on Account of his Capacity and natural Talents, to <HI>perse∣vere</HI> in Obedience, as his Posterity (taking one with ano∣ther) if they had all been put on the Trial singly for them∣selves. And supposing, that there was a constituted Union or Oneness of him and his Posterity, and that he stood as a publick Person, or common Head, all by this Constitu∣tion would have been as sure to partake of the Benefit of his Obedience, as of the ill Consequence of his Disobedi∣ence, in Case of his Fall.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was a <HI>greater Tendency</HI> to a happy Issue, in such an Appointment, than if every one had been ap∣pointed to stand for himself; especially on two Accounts.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="336" REF="008118_0356_0F6B58861F646468"/> (1.) That <HI>Adam</HI> had <HI>stronger Motives</HI> to <HI>Watchfulness,</HI> than his Posterity would have had; in that not only his own eternal Welfare lay at Stake, but also that of all his Posterity. (2.) <HI>Adam</HI> was in a State of compleat <HI>Man∣hood,</HI> when his Trial began. It was a Constitution very agreable to the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, considering the State of Mankind, which was to be propagated in the Way of Generation, that their <HI>first Father</HI> should be appointed to stand for all For by Reason of the Manner of their coming into Existence in a State of <HI>Infancy,</HI> and their coming so gradually to <HI>mature</HI> State, and so remaining for a great while in a State of Childhood and comparative Imperfection, after they were become moral Agents, they would be <HI>less fit</HI> to stand for themselves, than their first Father to stand for them.</P>
<P>If any Man, notwithstanding these Things, shall say, That for his own Part, if the Affair had been proposed to him, <HI>he</HI> should have <HI>chosen</HI> to have his eternal Interest trusted in <HI>his own</HI> Hands: 'Tis sufficient to answer, that no Man's vain Opinion of himself, as <HI>more fit</HI> to be trusted than others, alters the true Nature and Tendency of Things, as they demonstrably are in themselves.—Nor is it a just Objection. That this Constitution has in <HI>Event</HI> proved for the <HI>Hurt</HI> of Mankind. For it don't follow, that no Advantage was given for a <HI>happy</HI> Event, in such an Establishment, because it was not such as to make it utterly impossible there should be any other Event.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God in such a Constitution with <HI>Adam</HI> appears in this; That if there had been no <HI>sove∣reign gracious</HI> Establishment at all, but God had proceed∣ed only on the Foot of meer <HI>Justice,</HI> and had gone no further than this required, he might have demanded of <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Posterity, that they should perform <HI>perfect perpetual Obedience,</HI> without ever failing in the least Instance, on Pain of <HI>eternal Death;</HI> and might have made this Demand <HI>without</HI> the <HI>Promise</HI> of any positive <HI>Reward</HI> for their Obedience. For perfect Obedience is a <HI>Debt,</HI> that every one owes to his Creator; and there∣fore
<PB N="337" REF="008118_0357_0F6B588693A1D548"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what his Creator was not obliged to pay him for. None is obliged to pay his Debtor, only for discharging his just Debt.—But such was evidently the Constitution with <HI>Adam,</HI> that an eternal happy Life was to be the Consequence of his persevering Fidelity, to all such as were included within that Constitution (of which the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> was a Sign) as well as eternal Death to be the Consequence of his Disobedience.—I come now to consi∣der the</P>
<P>SECOND <HI>Difficulty.</HI>—It being thus manifest, that this Constitution, by which <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity are dealt with as <HI>One,</HI> is not unreasonable upon Account of it's be∣ing <HI>injurious</HI> and <HI>hurtful</HI> to the Interest of Mankind, the only thing remaining in the Objection against such a Con∣stitution, is the <HI>Impropriety</HI> of it, as implying <HI>Falshood,</HI> and Contradiction to the true Nature of Things; as here∣by they are view'd and treated <HI>as one,</HI> who are <HI>not</HI> one, but wholly distinct; and no arbitrary Constitution can ever make that to be true, which in it self considered is not true.</P>
<P>This Objection, however specious, is really founded on a false Hypothesis, and wrong Notion of what we call <HI>Sameness</HI> or <HI>Oneness,</HI> among created Things; and the seem∣ing Force of the Objection arises from Ignorance or In∣consideration of the <HI>Degree,</HI> in which created Identity or Oneness with past Existence, in general, depends on the sovereign Constitution and Law of the supreme Author and Disposer of the Universe.</P>
<P>Some Things, being most simply considered, are <HI>intirely distinct,</HI> and <HI>very diverse;</HI> which yet are so united by the established Law of the Creator, in some Respects and with Regard to some Purposes and Effects, that by Virtue of that Establishment it is with them as if they were <HI>One.</HI> Thus a <HI>Tree,</HI> grown great, and an hundred Years old, is <HI>One</HI> Plant with the little <HI>Sprout,</HI> that first came out of the Ground, from whence it grew, and has been continued in constant Succession; thô it's now so exceeding <HI>diverse,</HI> many Thousand Times bigger, and of a very different Form,
<PB N="338" REF="008118_0358_0F6B5887A8BAE140"/>
and perhaps not one Atom the very same: Yet God, accord∣ing to an established Law of Nature, has in a constant Suc∣cession communicated to it many of the same Qualities, and most important Properties, as if it were <HI>One.</HI> It has been his Pleasure, to constitute an Union in these Respects, and for these Purposes, naturally leading us to look upon all as <HI>One.</HI>—So the <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> at forty Years of Age, is <HI>one</HI> with the <HI>Infant-Body</HI> which first came into the World, from whence it grew; tho' now constituted of different Substance, and the greater Part of the Substance probably changed Scores (if not hundreds) of Times: and tho' it be now in so many Respects exceeding diverse, yet God, according to the Course of Nature, which he has been pleased to establish, has caused, that in a certain Method it should communicate with that <HI>infantile</HI> Body, in the same Life, the same Senses, the same Features, and many the same Qualities, and in Union with the same Soul; and so, with regard to these Purposes, 'tis dealt with by him <HI>as one</HI> Body. Again, the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> of a Man are <HI>one,</HI> in a very different Manner, &amp; for different Purposes. Considered in themselves, they are exceeding different Beings, of a Nature as diverse as can be conceived; and yet, by a very peculiar divine Constitution or Law of Na∣ture, which God has been pleased to establish, they are strongly united, and become <HI>One,</HI> in most important Re∣spects; a wonderful mutual Communication is establish∣ed; so that both become different Parts of the <HI>same Man.</HI> But the Union and mutual Communication they have, has Existence, and is intirely regulated and limited, according to the sovereign Pleasure of God, and the Constitution he has been pleased to establish.</P>
<P>And if we come even to the <HI>personal Identity</HI> of cre∣ated intelligent Beings, thô this be not allowed to consist wholly in that which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> places it in, i. e. <HI>Same Consciousness;</HI> yet I think it can't be denied, that this is one thing essential to it. But 'tis evident, that the Com∣munication or Continuance of the same Consciousness and Memory to any Subject, thro' successive Parts of Duration,
<PB N="339" REF="008118_0359_0F6B588800628A90"/>
depends wholly on a divine Establishment. There would be no Necessity, that the Remembrance and Idea's of what is past should continue to exist, but by an arbitrary Con∣stitution of the Creator.—If any should here insist, that there is no Need of having Recourse to any such <HI>Consti∣tution,</HI> in order to account for the Continuance of the <HI>same Consciousness;</HI> and should say, that the very <HI>Nature</HI> of the Soul is such as will sufficiently account for it; and that the Soul will retain the Idea's &amp; Consciousness it once had, according to the <HI>Course of Nature:</HI>—Then let it be remember'd, Who it is, gives the Soul this Nature; and let that be remember'd, which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says of the Course of Nature, before observed; denying, that <HI>the Course of Nature is a proper active Cause, which will work and go on by itself without God, if he lets and permits it;</HI> saying, that <HI>the Course of Nature, separate from the A∣gency of God, is no Cause, or Nothing;</HI> and affirming, that <HI>it's absolutely impossible, the Course of Nature should continue it self, or go on to operate by itself, any more than produce itself;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 410.</NOTE> and, that <HI>God, the Original of all Being, is the ONLY CAUSE of all natural Effects.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 416.</NOTE>—Here is worthy also to be observed, what Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> says of the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> in Words which he cites from Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mor. Phil. P. 7.</NOTE> <Q>It is the Will of the Mind that is the <HI>first Cause,</HI> that gives Subsistence &amp; Efficacy to all those <HI>Laws,</HI> who is the <HI>efficient Cause</HI> that produces the <HI>Phenomena,</HI> which appear in Analogy, Harmony and Agreement, according to these <HI>Laws.</HI></Q> And he says, <Q>The same Principles must take Place in Things pertain∣ing to <HI>moral,</HI> as well as natural Philosophy.</Q> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid P. 9▪</NOTE></P>
<P>From these Things it will clearly follow, that Identity of <HI>Consciousness</HI> depends wholly on a Law of <HI>Nature;</HI> and so, on the sovereign <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Agency</HI> of <HI>GOD;</HI> and therefore, that Personal Identity, and so the Derivation of the Pollution and Guilt of past Sins in the same Person, depends on an arbitrary divine <HI>Constitution:</HI> and this, even
<PB N="340" REF="008118_0360_0F6B588A606F9E90"/>
though we should allow the same Consciousness not to be the only Thing which constitutes Oneness of Person, but should, besides that, suppose Samen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of Substance requi∣site. For, if same Consciousness be <HI>one Thing</HI> necessary to Personal Identity, and this depends on God's sovereign <HI>Constitution,</HI> it will still follow, that personal Identity depends on God's sovereign <HI>Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>And with respect to the Identity of created Substance it self, in the different Moments of its Duration, I think, we shall greatly mistake, if we imagine it to be like that absolute, independent Identity of the FIRST BEING, whereby He is <HI>the same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever.</HI> Nay, on the contrary, it may be demonstrated, that even this Oneness of created Substance, existing at different Times, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eerly <HI>dependent</HI>Identity; dependent on the Pleasure and sovereign Constitution of Him who <HI>worketh all in all.</HI> This will follow from what is generally al∣lowed, and is certainly true, That God not only created all Things, and gave them Being at first, but continually preserves them, and upholds them in Being.—This being a Matter of considerable Importance, it may be worthy here to be considered with a little Attention.—Let us in∣quire therefore, in the first Place, Whether it ben't evident, that God does continually, by his immediate Power, <HI>up∣hold</HI> every created Substance in Being; and then let us see the <HI>Consequence.</HI></P>
<P>That God does, by his immediate Power, <HI>uphold</HI> every created Substance in Being, will be manifest, if we consi∣der, that their present Existen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is a <HI>dependent</HI> Existence, and therefore is an <HI>Effect,</HI> and must have some <HI>Cause:</HI> and the Cause must be one of these two; either the <HI>ante∣cedent Existence</HI> of the same Substance, or else the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Creator.</HI> But it can't be the <HI>antecedent Existence</HI> of the same Substance. For Instance, the Existence of the Body of the <HI>Moon</HI> at this present Moment, can't be the <HI>Effect</HI> of it's Existence at the last foregoing Moment. For not only was what existed the last Moment, no active Cause, but wholly a passive Thing; But this also is to be consi∣dered,
<PB N="341" REF="008118_0361_0F6B588B0DF67A68"/>
that no Cause can produce Effects in a <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> in which it self is <HI>not.</HI> 'Tis plain, Nothing can exert itself, or operate, <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> it is not existing. But the Moon's past Existence was neither <HI>where</HI> not <HI>when</HI> its present Existence is.—In point of <HI>Time;</HI> what is <HI>past,</HI> intirely ceases, when <HI>present</HI> Existence begins; other∣wise it would not be <HI>past.</HI> The past Moment is ceased and gone, when the present Moment takes Place,; and does no more <HI>co-exist</HI> with it, than does any other Moment that had ceased twenty Years ago. Nor could the past Existence of the Particles of this <HI>moving Body</HI> produce Effects in any <HI>other Place,</HI> than where it then was. But its Existence at the present Moment, in every Point of it, is in a different <HI>Place,</HI> from where its Existence was at the last preceeding Moment. From these Things, I suppose, it will certainly follow, that the present Existence, either of this, or any other created Substance, cannot be an Effect of its past Existence. The Existences (so to speak) of an Effect, or Thing dependent, in different Parts of Space or Duration, thô ever so <HI>near</HI> one to another, don't at all <HI>co-exist</HI> one with the other; and therefore are as truly different Effects, as if those Parts of Space and Duration were ever so far asunder: And the prior Existence can no more be the proper Cause of the new Existence, in the next Moment, or next Part of Space, than if it had been in an Age before, or at a Thousand Miles Distance, without any Existence to fill up the intermediate Time or Space. Therefore the Existence of created Substances, in each successive Moment, must be the Effect of the <HI>immediate</HI> Agency, Will, and Power of GOD.</P>
<P>If any shall say, This Reasoning is not good, &amp; shall insist upon it, that there is <HI>no Need</HI> of any immediate <HI>divine</HI> Power, to produce the present Existence of created Sub∣stances, but that their present Existence is the Effect or Consequence of past Existence, according to the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things; that the established <HI>Course of Nature</HI> is suffi∣ent to <HI>continue</HI> Existence, where Existence is once given;—I allow it: But then it should be remembered, <HI>what</HI> Na∣ture
<PB N="342" REF="008118_0362_0F6B588BE3F96D48"/>
is, in created Things; and <HI>what</HI> the established <HI>Course</HI> of Nature is; That, as has been observed already, <HI>it is Nothing, separate from the Agency of God;</HI> and that, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> says, <HI>GOD, the Original of all Being, is the ONLY Cause of all natural Effects.</HI>—A Father, according to the Course of Nature, begets a Child; an Oak, accord∣ing to the Course of Nature, produces an Acorn, or a Bud; so according to the Course of Nature, the former Exist∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of the Trunk of the Tree is followed by it's new or present Existence. In the one Case, and the other, the new Effect is consequent on the former, only by the <HI>estab∣lished Laws,</HI> and <HI>settled Course of Nature;</HI> which is al∣lowed to be Nothing but the continued immediate Effici∣ency of GOD, according to a <HI>Constitution</HI> that he has been pleased to establish. Therefore, as our Author greatly urges, that the Child and the Acorn, which come into Existence according to a <HI>Constitution</HI> that he has been pleased to establish. Therefore, as our Author greatly urges, that the Child and the Acorn, which come into Existence according to the <HI>Course of Nature,</HI> in Con∣sequence of the prior Existence and State of the Parent and the Oak, are truly <HI>immediately</HI> created or made by God; so must the Existence of each created Person and Thing, at each Moment of it, be from the immediate <HI>conti∣nued</HI> Creation of God. It will certainly follow from these Things, that God's <HI>preserving</HI> created Things in Being is perfectly equivalent to a <HI>continued Creation,</HI> or to his creating those Things out of Nothing at <HI>each Moment</HI> of their Existence. If the continued Existence of created Things be wholly dependent on God's Preservation, then those Things would drop into Nothing, upon the ceasing of the present Moment, without a new Exertion of the di∣vine Power to cause them to exist in the following Mo∣ment. If there be any who own, that God preserves Things in Being, and yet hold that they would continue in Being without any further Help from him, after they once have Existence; I think, it is hard to know what they mean. To what Purpose can it be, to talk of God's <HI>preserving</HI> Things in Being, when there is <HI>no Need</HI> of his preserving them? Or to talk of their being <HI>dependent</HI> on God for continued Existence, when they would of
<PB N="343" REF="008118_0363_0F6B588C80037AA0"/>
themselves continue to exist, without his Help; nay, though he should wholly withdraw his sustaining Power and In∣fluence?</P>
<P>It will follow from what has been observed, that God's upholding created Substance, or causing it's Existence in each successive Moment, is altogether equivalent to an <HI>im∣mediate Production out of Nothing,</HI> at each Moment. Be∣cause it's Existence at this Moment is not meerly in Part from <HI>God,</HI> but wholly from him; and not in any Part, or Degree, from it's <HI>antecedent Existence.</HI> For the suppo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, that it's antecedent Existence <HI>concurs</HI> with God in <HI>Efficiency,</HI> to produce some <HI>Part</HI> of the Effect, is attend∣ed with all the very same Absurdities, which have been shown to attend the Supposition of it's producing it <HI>wholly.</HI> Therefore the antecedent Existence is Nothing, as to any proper Influence or Assistance in the Affair: And conse∣quently <HI>God</HI> produces the Effect as much from <HI>Nothing,</HI> as if there had been Nothing <HI>before.</HI> So that this Effect differs not at all from the first Creation, but only <HI>Circum∣stantially;</HI> as in <HI>first</HI> Creation there had been no such Act and Effect of God's Power <HI>before:</HI> whereas, his giv∣ing Existence afterwards, <HI>follows</HI> preceeding Acts and Effects of the same Kind, in an established Order.</P>
<P>Now, in the next Place, let us see how the <HI>Consequence</HI> of these Things is to my present Purpose. If the Exist∣ence of created <HI>Substance,</HI> in each successive Moment, be wholly the Effect of God's immediate Power, in <HI>that</HI> Mo∣ment, without any Dependence on prior Existence, as much as the first Creation out of <HI>Nothing,</HI> then what exists at this Moment, by this Power, is a <HI>new Effect;</HI> and simply &amp; absolutely considered, not the same with any past Existence, tho' it be like it, and follows it according to a certain established Method. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When I suppose, that an Effect which is produced, every Mo∣ment, by a new Action or Exertion of Power, must be a <HI>new</HI> Effect in each Moment, and not absolutely and numerically the same with that which existed in pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeding Moments, the Thing that I intend, may be illustrated by this Example. The lucid Colour of Brightness of the <HI>Moon,</HI> as we look stedfastly upon it, seems to be a <HI>permanent</HI> Thing, as though it were perfectly the same Brightness continued. But in∣deed it is an Effect produced every Moment. It ceases, and is renewed, in each successive Point of Time; and so be∣comes altogether a <HI>new</HI> Effect at each Instant; and no one Thing that belongs to it, is numerically the same that existed in the preceeding Moment. The Rays of the Sun, impressed on that Body, and reflected from it, which cause the Effect, are none of them the same: The Impression, made in each Moment on our Sensory, is by the Stroke of <HI>new</HI> Rays: And the Sensation, excited by the Stroke, is a new Effect, an Effect of a <HI>new</HI> Impulse. Therefore the Brightness or lucid Whiteness of this Body is no more numerically the same Thing with that which existed in the preceeding Moment, than the <HI>Sound</HI> of the Wind that blows now, is individually the same with that which pass'd a little before. And if it be thus with the Brightness or Colour of the Moon, so it must be with it's <HI>Solidity,</HI> and every thing else belonging to it's Substance, if all be, each Moment, as much the im∣mediate Effect of a <HI>new</HI> Exertion or Application of Power.</P>
<P>The Matter may perhaps be in some Respects still more clear∣ly illustrated by this.—The <HI>Images</HI> of Things in a <HI>Glass,</HI> as we keep our Eye upon them, seem to remain precisely the same, with a continuing perfect Identity. But it is known to be otherwise. Philosophers well know, that these Ima∣ges are constantly <HI>renewed,</HI> by the Impression and Reflexion of <HI>new</HI> Rays of Light; so that the Image impress'd by the former Rays is constantly vanishing, and a <HI>new</HI> Image im∣press'd by <HI>new</HI> Rays every Moment, both on the Glass and on the Eye. The Image constantly renewed, by new suc∣cessive rays, is no more numerically the same, than if it were by some Artist put on a-new with a Pencil, and the Co∣lours constantly vanishing as fast as put on. And the new Images being put on <HI>immediately</HI> or instantly, don't make 'em the same, any more than if it were done with the Intermissi∣on of an <HI>Hour</HI> or a <HI>Day.</HI> The Image that exists this Mo∣ment, is not at all <HI>derived</HI> from the Image which existed the last preceeding Moment: as may be seen, because, if the Succession of new <HI>Rays</HI> be intercepted, by something inter∣posed between the Object and the Glass, the Image imme∣diately ceases; the <HI>past Existence</HI> of the Image has no Influ∣ence to uphold it, so much as for one Moment. Which shews, that the Image is altogether new-made every Mo∣ment; and strictly speaking, is in no Part numerically the same with that which existed the Moment preceeding. And truly so the Matter must be with the <HI>Bodies</HI> themselves, as well as their Images: They also cannot be the same, with an absolute Identity, but must be wholly renewed every Moment, if the Case be as has been proved, that their present existence is not, strictly speaking, at all the Effect of their past existence; but is wholly, every Instant, the Effect of a new Agency, or Exertion of the Power, of the Cause or thier Existence. If so, the Existence caused is every Instant a new Effect, whether the Cause be <HI>Light,</HI> or immediate <HI>di∣vine Power,</HI> or whatever it be.</P></NOTE> And there is no Identity or

Oneness in the Case, but what depends on the <HI>arbitrary</HI> Constitution of the Creator; who by his wise sovereign Establishment so unites these successive new Effects, that he <HI>treats them as One,</HI> by communicating to them like Properties, Relations, &amp; Circumstances; and so, leads <HI>us</HI> to regard and treat them as <HI>one.</HI> When I call this an <HI>ar∣bitrary Constitution,</HI> I mean, that it is a Constitution which
<PB N="345" REF="008118_0365_0F6B588E056B96A8"/>
depends on Nothing but the <HI>divine Will;</HI> which divine Will depends on Nothing but the <HI>divine Wisdom.</HI> In this Sense, the whole <HI>Course of Nature,</HI> with all that be∣longs to it, all it's Laws and Methods, and Constancy and Regularity, Continuance and Proceeding, is an <HI>arbitrary Constitution.</HI> In this Sense, the Continuance of the very Being of the World and all it's Parts, as well as the Man∣ner of continued Being, depends entirely on an <HI>arbitrary Constitution:</HI> for it don't at all <HI>necessarily</HI> follow, that because there was Sound, or Light, or Colour, or Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist∣ance, or Gravity, or Thought, or Consciousness, or any other dependent Thing the last Moment, that therefore there shall be the like at the next.—All dependent Existence whatsoever is in a constant Flux, ever passing

and returning; renewed every Moment, as the Colours of Bodies are every Moment renewed by the Light that shines upon them; and all is constantly proceeding from GOD, as Light from the Sun. <HI>In Him we live, and move, and have our Being.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, if we consider Matters strictly, there is no such Thing as any Identity or Oneness in created Objects, existing at different Times, but what depends on <HI>GOD's sovereign Constitution.</HI> And so it appears, that the <HI>Objection</HI> we are upon, made against a supposed divine Constitution, whereby <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Posterity</HI> are view'd and treated as <HI>One,</HI> in the Manner and for the Pur∣poses supposed, as if it were <HI>not consistent with Truth,</HI> because no Constitution can make those to be <HI>one,</HI> which are not one; I say, it appears that this Objection is built on a false Hypothesis: For it appears, that a <HI>divine Con∣stitution</HI> is the Thing which <HI>makes Truth,</HI> in Affairs of this Nature. The Objection supposes, there is a Oneness in created Beings, whence Qualities and Relations are de∣rived down from past Existence, <HI>distinct</HI> from, and <HI>prior</HI> to any Oneness that can be supposed to be founded on divine<HI>Constitution.</HI> Which is demonstrably false; and sufficiently appears so from things conceded by the Adver∣saries themselves: And therefore the Objection wholly falls to the Ground.</P>
<P>There are <HI>various Kinds</HI> of Identity &amp; Oneness, found among created Things, by which they become one in <HI>different Manners, Respects</HI> and <HI>Degrees,</HI> and to <HI>various Purposes;</HI> several of which Differences have been observ∣ed; and every Kind is ordered, regulated and limited, in every Respect, by <HI>divine Constitution.</HI> Some Things, exist∣ing in different Times &amp; Places, are treated by their Creator as One in <HI>one Respect,</HI> and others in <HI>another;</HI> some are united for <HI>this Communication,</HI> and others for <HI>that;</HI> but all according to the <HI>sovereign Pleasure</HI> of the Fountain of all Being and Operation.</P>
<P>It appears, particularly, from what has been said, that all Oneness, by Virtue whereof <HI>Pollution</HI> and <HI>Guilt</HI> from

<HI>past</HI> Wickedness are derived, depends intirely on a <HI>divine Establishment.</HI> 'Tis this, and this only, that must account for Guilt and an evil Taint on any individual Soul, in Consequence of a Crime committed twenty or forty Years ago, remaining still, and even to the End of the World and forever. 'Tis this, that must account for the Conti∣nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of any such Thing, any where, as <HI>Consciousness</HI> of Acts that are past; and for the Continuance of all <HI>Habits,</HI> either good or bad: and on this depends every Thing that can belong to <HI>personal Identity.</HI> And all Communications, Derivations, or Continuation of Qualities, Properties, or Relations, natural or moral, from what is <HI>past,</HI> as if the Subject were <HI>one,</HI> depends on no other Foundation.</P>
<P>And I am persuaded, no solid Reason can be given, why God, who constitutes all other created Union or Oneness, according to his Pleasure, and for what Purposes, Com∣munications, and Effects, he pleases, may not establish a Constitution whereby the natural <HI>Posterity</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> pro∣ceeding from him, much as the Buds and Branches from the Stock or Root of a Tree, should be treated as <HI>One</HI> with him, for the Derivation, either of Righteousness, and Communion in Rewards, or of the Loss of Righteousness, and consequent Corruption and Guilt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I appeal to such as are not wont to content themselves with judging by a superficial Appearance and View of Things, but are habituated to examine things strictly and closely, that they may judge righteous Judgement, Whether on Supposition that all Mankind had <HI>co-existed,</HI> in the Man∣ner mention'd before, any good Reason can be given, why their Creator might not, If he had pleased, have established such an <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Adam</HI> and the rest of Mankind, as was in that Case supposed. Particularly, if it had been the Case, that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity had actually, according to a Law of Nature, some how <HI>grown out of him,</HI> &amp; yet remain'd <HI>contiguous</HI> and literally <HI>united to him,</HI> as the Branches to a Tree, or the Members of the Body to the Head; and had all, before the Fall, existed together at the <HI>same Time,</HI> thô in <HI>different Places,</HI> as the Head and Members are in different Places: In this Case, who can determine, that the Author of Nature might not, if it had pleased him, have established such an <HI>Union</HI> between the Root and Branches of this complex Being, as that all should constitute <HI>one</HI> moral Whole; so that by the Law of Union, there should be a Communication in each <HI>moral Alteration,</HI> and that the Heart of every <HI>Branch</HI> should at the same Moment participate with the Heart of the <HI>Root,</HI> be con∣formed to it and concurring with it in all its Affections and Acts, and so jointly partaking in its State, as a <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>same Thing?</HI> Why might not God, if he had pleased, have fix'd such a Kind of Union as this, an Union of the various Parts of such a <HI>moral While,</HI> as well as many other Unions, which he has actually fix'd, according to his sovereign Plea∣sure? And if he might, by his sovereign Constitution, have established such as Union of the various Branches of Man∣kind, when existing. In different <HI>Places,</HI> I don't see why he might not also do the same, though they exist in different <HI>Times.</HI> I know not why Succession, or Diversity of <HI>Time,</HI> should make any such con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itued Union more unreasonable, than Diversity of <HI>Place.</HI> The only Reason, why Diversity of <HI>Time</HI> can seem to make it unreasonable, is, that Difference of Time shews, there is no absolute Identity of the Things existing in those different Times: But it shews this, I think, not at all more than the Difference of the <HI>Place</HI> of Existence.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="008118_0368_0F6B589045E137F0"/>As I said before, All Oneness in created Things, whence Qualities and Relations are derived, depends on a divine Constitution that is <HI>arbitrary,</HI> in every other Respect, ex∣cepting that it is regulated by divine Wisdom. The Wis∣dom, which is exercised in these Constitutions, appears in these two Things. <HI>First,</HI> In a beautiful <HI>Analogy</HI> and <HI>Harmony</HI> with <HI>other</HI> Laws or Constitutions, especially re∣lating to the same Subject: and <HI>Secondly,</HI> in the good <HI>Ends</HI> obtain'd, or useful <HI>Consequences</HI> of such a Constitu∣tion. If therefore there be any Objection still lying against this Constitution with <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity, it must be, that it is not sufficiently <HI>wise</HI> in these Respects. But what extreme <HI>Arrogance</HI> would it be in us, to take upon us to act as Judges of the Beauty and Wisdom of the Laws and established Constitutions of the supreme Lord and Creator of the Universe?—And not only so, but if this Consti∣tution,
<PB N="349" REF="008118_0369_0F6B58917539A028"/>
in particular, be well considered, it's <HI>Wisdom,</HI> in the two forementioned Respects, may easily be made evi∣dent. There is an apparent manifold <HI>Analogy</HI> to other Constitutions and Laws, established and maintained through the whole System of vital Nature in this lower World; all Parts of which, in all Successions, are derived from the <HI>first of the Kind,</HI> as from their Root, or Fountain; each deriving from thence all Properties and Qualities, that are proper to the Nature &amp; Capacity of the Kind, or Species: No <HI>Derivative</HI> having any one Perfection (unless it be what is merely circumstantial) but what was in it's <HI>Primitive.</HI> And that <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity should be without that <HI>original Righteousness,</HI> which <HI>Adam</HI> had lost, is also <HI>analogous</HI> to other Laws and Establishments, relating to the Nature of Mankind; according to which, <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity have no one Perfection of Nature, in any Kind, superiour to what was in him, when the human Race began to be pro∣pagated from him.</P>
<P>And as such a Constitution was <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> in other Respects, so it was in this that follows. Seeing the divine Constitution concerning the <HI>Manner</HI> of Mankind's coming into Existence in their Propagation, was such as did so na∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rally <HI>unite</HI> them, &amp; made 'em in so many Respects <HI>One,</HI> naturally leading them to a close Union in Society, and manifold Intercourse, and mutual Dependence, Things were wisely so established, that all should naturally be in one and the same <HI>moral State;</HI> and not in such exceed∣ing different States, as that some should be perfectly <HI>inno∣cent</HI> and holy, but others <HI>corrupt</HI> and wicked; some need∣ing a <HI>Saviour,</HI> but others needing none; some in a con∣firmed State of perfect <HI>Happiness,</HI> but others in a State of publick Condemnation to perfect and eternal <HI>Misery;</HI> some justly exposed to great Calamities in this World, but others by their Innocence raised above all Suffering. Such a vast Diversity of State would by no Means have agreed with the natural &amp; necessary Constitution &amp; unavoidable Situation and Circumstances of the World of Mankind; <HI>all made of one Blood, to dwell on all the Face of the

Earth,</HI> to be united and blended in Society, and to partake together in the natural and common Goods and Evils of this lower World▪</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> urges, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 13.</NOTE> that <HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Shame</HI> are only for <HI>personal</HI> Sin: and it has often been urged, that <HI>Repentance</HI> can be for no other Sin. To which I would say, that the Use of <HI>Words</HI> is very arbitrary: But that Men's <HI>Hearts</HI> should be deeply affected with Grief and Humiliation be∣fore God, for the Pollution and Guilt which they bring into the World with them, I think, is not in the least <HI>un∣reasonable.</HI> Nor is it a Thing strange and unheard of, that Men should be <HI>ashamed</HI> of Things done by <HI>others,</HI> whom they are nearly concerned in. I am sure, it is not <HI>unscrip∣tural;</HI> especially when they are justly looked upon in the Sight of God, who sees the Disposition of their Hearts, as fully <HI>consenting</HI> and <HI>concurring.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been observed it may appear, there is no sure Ground to conclude, that it must be an absurd and impossible Thing, for the Race of Mankind truly to par∣take of the <HI>Sin</HI> of the first Apostacy, so as that this, in Reality &amp; Propriety, shall become <HI>their</HI> Sin; by Virtue of a real <HI>Union</HI> between the Root and Branches of the World of Mankind (truly and properly availing to such a Conse∣quence) established by the Author of the whole System of the Universe; to whose Establishments is owing all Pro∣priety and Reality of <HI>Union,</HI> in any Part of that System; and by Virtue of the full <HI>Consent</HI> of the Hearts of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity to that first Apostacy. And therefore the Sin of the Apostacy is not their's, meerly because God <HI>imputes</HI> it to them; but it is <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>properly</HI> their's, and on that <HI>Ground,</HI> God imputes it to them.</P>
<P>By Reason of the established <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity, theCase is far otherwise between him &amp; them, than it is between distinct Parts or Individuals of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Race; betwixt whom is no such constituted <HI>Union:</HI> As, between Children &amp; other Ancestors.

<P>In what is said here, there is a special Respect to the in∣troducing the Gospel-Dispensation; as is greatly confirm∣ed by comparing this Place with <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 29, 30, 31.

<P>On the Whole, if any don't like the <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or the <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> (as some perhaps may chuse to call it) made use of in the foregoing Reasonings; yet I cannot doubt, but that a proper Consideration of what is apparent and undeniable in <HI>Fact,</HI> with respect to the <HI>Dependence</HI> of the State and Course of Things in this Universe on the sovereign <HI>Constitutions</HI> of the supreme Author and Lord of all, who <HI>gives none Account of any of his Matters,</HI> and <HI>whose Ways are past finding out,</HI> will be sufficient, with Persons of common Modesty &amp; Sobriety, to stop their Mouths, from making peremptory Decisions against the <HI>Justice</HI> of God, respecting what is so plainly and fully taught in <HI>his holy Word,</HI> concerning the <HI>Derivation</HI> of a Depravity and Guilt from <HI>Adam</HI> to his Posterity; a Thing so abundantly confirm'd by what is found in the <HI>Experi∣ence</HI> of all Mankind in all Ages.</P>

<P>It may not be improper here to add something (by Way of Supplement to this Chapter, in which we have had Oc∣casion to say so much about the <HI>Imputation</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin) concerning the Opinions of <HI>two Divines,</HI> of no in∣considerable Note among the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> re∣lating to a <HI>partial Imputation</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI> first Sin.</P>
<P><HI>One</HI> of them supposes, that this Sin, thô truly <HI>imputed</HI> to INFANTS, so that thereby they are exposed to a proper <HI>Punishment,</HI> yet is not imputed to them in such a <HI>Degree,</HI> as that upon this Account they should be liable to <HI>eternal</HI> Punishment, as <HI>Adam</HI> himself was, but only to <HI>temporal Death,</HI> or <HI>Annibilation; Adam</HI> himself, the immediate Actor, being made infinitely <HI>more guilty</HI> by it, than his Posterity.—On which I would observe; That to sup∣pose, God imputes not <HI>all</HI> the Guilt of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, but only some <HI>little Part</HI> of it, this relieves Nothing but one's <HI>Imagination.</HI> To think of poor little <HI>Infants</HI> bearing such Torments for <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, as they sometimes do in this World, and these Torments ending in Death andAn∣nihilation, may fit easier on the Imagination, than to con∣ceive of their suffering eternal Misery for it. But it does not at all relieve one's <HI>Reason.</HI> There is no Rule of Reason, that can be supposed to lie against imputing a Sin in the <HI>Whole</HI> of it, which was committed by one, to ano∣ther who did not personally commit it, but what will also lie against its being so imputed and punished in <HI>Part.</HI> For all the Reasons (if there are any) lie against the <HI>Imputa∣tion;</HI> not the <HI>Quantity</HI> or <HI>Degree of what is imputed.</HI> If there be any Rule of Reason, that is strong and good, lying against a proper Derivation or Communication of Guilt, from one that acted, to another that did not act; then it lies against <HI>all</HI> that is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nature. The Force of the
<PB N="354" REF="008118_0374_0F6B5897652696F0"/>
Reasons brought against imputing <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin to his Poste∣rity (if there be any Force in them) lies in this, That <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity are not <HI>One.</HI> But this lies as pro∣perly against charging a <HI>Part</HI> of the Guilt, as the Whole. For <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity, by not being the same with him, had no more Hand in a <HI>Little</HI> of what was done, than in the Whole. They were as absolutely free from being con∣cerned in that Act <HI>partly,</HI> as they were <HI>wholly.</HI> And there is no Reason can be brought, why one Man's Sin can't be justly reckon'd to another's Account, who was not then in Being, in the <HI>Whole</HI> of it; but what will as properly lie against it's being reckon'd to him in any <HI>Part,</HI> so as that he should be subject to any Condemnation or Punish∣ment on that Account.—If those Reasons are good, all the <HI>Difference</HI> there can be, is this; That to bring a <HI>great</HI> Punishment on Infants for <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, is a <HI>great</HI> Act of In∣justice, and to bring a comparatively <HI>small</HI> Punishment▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>smaller</HI> Act of Injustice; but not, that this is not <HI>as truly and demonstrably</HI> an Act of Injustice, as the other.</P>
<P>To illustrate this by an Instance something parallel. 'Tis used as an Argument why I may not exact from one of my Neighbours, what was due to me from <HI>another,</HI> that <HI>he</HI> and <HI>my Debtor</HI> are <HI>not the same;</HI> and that their Concerns, Interests &amp; Properties are intirely distinct. Now if this Argument be good, it lies as truly against my de∣manding from him a <HI>Part</HI> of the Debt, as the Whole. Indeed it is a <HI>greater</HI> Act of Injustice, for me to take from him the <HI>Whole</HI> of it, than a Part; but not <HI>more truly</HI> and <HI>certainly</HI> an Act of Injustice.</P>
<P>The <HI>other</HI> Divine thinks, there is truly an Imputation of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, so that <HI>Infants</HI> can't be look'd upon as <HI>innocent</HI> Creatures; yet seems to think it <HI>not agreable to the Perfec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of God,</HI> to make the State of Infants in another World <HI>worse</HI> than a State of <HI>Non-existence.</HI> But this to me appears plainly a <HI>giving up</HI> that grand Point of the <HI>Imputation</HI> of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, both in Whole and in Part. For it supposes it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not right, for God to bring any <HI>Evil</HI> on a Child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dam,</HI> which is innocent

as to personal Sin, without <HI>paying for it,</HI> or balancing it with <HI>Good;</HI> so that still the State of the Child shall be as <HI>good,</HI> as could be demanded in <HI>Justice,</HI> in Case of meer <HI>Innocence.</HI> Which plainly supposes, that the Child is not exposed to any proper <HI>Punishment</HI> at all, or is not at all in <HI>Debt</HI> to divine Justice, on the Account of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin. For if the Child were truly in <HI>Debt,</HI> then surely <HI>Justice</HI> might <HI>take</HI> something from him, <HI>without paying for it,</HI> or without <HI>giving</HI> that which makes it's State as <HI>good,</HI> as meer <HI>Innocence</HI> could in Justice require.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 359, &amp;c.</NOTE> If he owes the suffer∣ing of some <HI>Punishment,</HI> then there is no Need that <HI>Justice</HI> should <HI>requite</HI> the Infant for suffering that Punishment; or <HI>make up for it,</HI> by conferring some <HI>Good,</HI> that shall coun∣tervail it, and in Effect remove and disannul it; so that, on the Whole, <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> shall be at an even <HI>Balance,</HI> yea, so that the Scale of <HI>Good</HI> shall <HI>preponderate.</HI> If it is <HI>unjust</HI> in a Judge, to order any Quantity of Money to be taken from another, without paying him again, &amp; fully making it up to him, it must be because he had justly <HI>for∣feited none</HI> at all.</P>
<P>It seems to me pretty manifest, that none can, in good Consistence with themselves, own a real <HI>Imputation</HI> of the Guilt of <HI>Adam's</HI> first Sin to his Posterity, without owning that they are <HI>justly</HI> view'd and treated as <HI>Sinners,</HI> truly guilty, and <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> on that Account; nor unless they allow a just Imputation of the <HI>Whole</HI> of the <HI>Evil</HI> of that Transgression; at least, all that pertains to the Essence of that Act, as a full and compleat Violation of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which God had established; even as much as if each one of Mankind had the like Covenant esta∣blished with him singly, and had by the like direct &amp; full Act of Rebellion, violated it for himself.</P>

<P>DR. <HI>T.</HI> objects against <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity's being sup∣posed to come into the World under a <HI>Forfeiture</HI> of God's <HI>Blessing,</HI> and subject to his <HI>Curse</HI> through his Sin,—<HI>That at the</HI> Restoration <HI>of the World after the</HI> Flood, <HI>God pronounced equivalent or greater</HI> Blessings on <HI>Noah</HI> and his Sons, than he did on <HI>Adam</HI> at his Creation, when he said, <HI>Be fruitful, and multiply, &amp; replenish the Earth, &amp; have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PART II. Chap. I. Sect. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>To this I answer, in the following Remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. As it has been already shewn, that in the <HI>Threat∣ning,</HI> denounced for <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, there was Nothing which appears <HI>inconsistent</HI> with the <HI>Continuance</HI> of this <HI>present</HI> Life for a Season, or with the <HI>Propagating</HI> his Kind; so for the like Reason, there appears Nothing in that Threat∣ning, upon the Supposition that it reach'd <HI>Adam'</HI>s Poste∣rity, <HI>inconsistent</HI> with their enjoying the <HI>temporal Blessings</HI> of the present Life, as long as this is continued: even those temporal Blessings which God pronounced on <HI>Adam</HI> at his first Creation. For it must be observed, that the Blessings which God pronounced on <HI>Adam,</HI> when he first created him, and <HI>before the Trial of his Obedience,</HI> were not the same with the Blessings which were <HI>suspended on his Obedience.</HI> The Blessings thus suspended, were the Blessings of <HI>eternal Life;</HI> which, if he had maintain'd his Integrity through his Trial, would have been pronounced upon him <HI>afterwards;</HI> when God, as his Judge, should have given him his Reward. God might indeed, if he had pleas'd, <HI>immediately</HI> have deprived him of <HI>Life,</HI> and of all <HI>temporal Blessings,</HI> given him before. But those Bles∣sings pronounced on him before-hand, were not the Things, for the obtaining of which his <HI>Trial</HI> was appointed. These were <HI>reserved,</HI> till the <HI>Issue</HI> of his Trial should be seen,
<PB N="357" REF="008118_0377_0F6B589A041B9ED8"/>
and <HI>then</HI> to be pronounc'd, in the blessed Sentence, which would have been pass'd upon him by his Judge, when God came to decree to him his Reward for his approved Fide∣lity. The pronouncing these latter Blessings on a degene∣rate Race, that had fallen under the <HI>Threatning</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noun∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, would indeed (without a Redemption) have been in∣consistent with the <HI>Constitution</HI> which had been established. But the giving them the <HI>former</HI> Kind of Blessings, which were not the Things suspended on the Trial, or depen∣dent on his Fidelity (and these to be continued for a Sea∣son) was not at all inconsistent therewith.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis no more an Evidence of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Posterity's being not included in the Threatning, denounced for his eating the forbidden Fruit, That they still have the <HI>tem∣poral</HI> Blessings of Fruitfulness and a Dominion over the Creatures <HI>continued</HI> to them, than it is an Evidence of <HI>Adam's</HI> being not included in that Threatning himself, That <HI>he</HI> had these Blessings <HI>continued</HI> to him, was fruit∣ful, and had Dominion over the Creatures <HI>after his Fall,</HI> equally with his Posterity.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is good Evidence, that there were Blessings implied in the Benedictions God pronounced on <HI>Noah</HI> and his Posterity, which were granted on a <HI>new Foundation:</HI> on the Foot of a Dispensation <HI>diverse</HI> from any Grant, Promise, or Revelation, which God gave to <HI>Adam,</HI> ante∣cedently to his Fall; even on the Foundation of the <HI>Cove∣nant of Grace,</HI> established in <HI>Christ Jesus;</HI> a Dispensa∣tion, the Design of which is to deliver Men from the <HI>Curse,</HI> that came upon them by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, and to bring them to <HI>greater</HI> Blessings than over <HI>he</HI> had. These Bles∣sings were pronounced on <HI>Noah</HI> and his Seed, on the same Foundation, whereon afterwards the Blessing was pronoun∣ced on <HI>Abraham</HI> and his Seed, which included both spi∣ritual and temporal Benefits.—<HI>Noah</HI> had his Name pro∣phetically given him by his Father <HI>Lamech,</HI> because by him and his Seed Deliverance should be obtained from the <HI>Curse,</HI> which came by <HI>Adam'</HI>s Fall. Gen. v.29. <HI>And he called his Name</HI> Noah (i. e. REST,) <HI>saying, This
<PB N="358" REF="008118_0378_0F6B589ACC4E40D8"/>
same shall comfort us concerning our Work, and Toil of our Hands, because of the Ground which the Lord hath cursed.</HI> Pursuant to the Scope and Intent of this <HI>Pro∣phecy</HI> (which indeed seems to respect the same Thing with the Prophecy in <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15.) are the Blessings pronoun∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on <HI>Noah</HI> after the Flood. There is this Evidence of these Blessings being conveyed thrô the Channel of the Covenant of Grace, and by the Redemption thrô Jesus Christ, That they were obtain'd by <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> or were be∣stow'd as the Effect of <HI>God's Favour</HI> to Mankind, which was in Consequence of God's <HI>smelling a sweet Savour</HI> in the Sacrifice which <HI>Noah</HI> offered. And 'tis very evident by the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> that the ancient Sacrifices never obtain'd the Favour of God, but only by Virtue of the <HI>Relation</HI> they had to the Sacrifice of <HI>Christ.</HI>—That now <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family had been so wonderfully saved from the Wrath of God, which had destroyed the rest of the World, and that the World was as it were restored from a ruin'd State, this was a proper Occasion to point to the <HI>great Salvation</HI> to come by Christ: As it was a common Thing, for God, on Occasion of some great <HI>Temporal</HI> Sal∣vation of his People, or Restoration from a low and mise∣rable State, to renew the Intimations of the great <HI>spiri∣tual</HI> Restoration of the World by <HI>Christ's Redemption.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be noted that Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself signifies it as his Mind, that these Blessings on <HI>Noah</HI> were on the Foot of the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> P. 360, 366, 367, 368.</NOTE> God deals with the Generality of Mankind, in their pre∣sent State, for differently, on Occasion of the Redemption by Jesus Christ, from what he otherwise would do: For, being capable Subjects of saving Mercy, they have a Day of Patience and Grace, &amp; innumerable temporal Blessings bestowed on them; which, as the Apostle signifies (<HI>Act.</HI>xiv. 17.) are Testimonies of God's Reconcilableness to sinful Men, to put 'em upon <HI>seeking after God.</HI></P>
<P>But beside the Sense in which the Posterity of <HI>Noah</HI> in general partake of these Blessings of <HI>Dominion ever the
<PB N="359" REF="008118_0379_0F6B589B82883D38"/>
Creatures</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Noah</HI> himself, and all such of his Posterity as have obtained like precious <HI>Faith</HI> with that exercised by him in offering his <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> which made it a <HI>sweet Sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur,</HI> and by which it procured these Blessings, have <HI>Dominion</HI> over the Creatures, thrô Christ, in a more ex∣cellent Sense than <HI>Adam</HI> in Innocency; as they are <HI>made Kings and Priests unto God, and reign with Christ,</HI> and <HI>all Things are theirs,</HI> by a Covenant of <HI>Grace.</HI> They partake with Christ in that <HI>Dominion over the Beasts of the Earth, the Fowls of the Air, and Fishes of the Sea,</HI> spoken of in the viiith <HI>Psalm;</HI> which is by the Apostle interpreted of <HI>Christ's</HI> Dominion over the World. (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 27.) &amp; <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 7.) And the Time is coming, when the greater Part of the Posterity of <HI>Noah</HI> &amp; each of his Sons, shall partake of this more honourable and excellent Domi∣nion over the Creatures, through Him <HI>in whom all the Families of the Earth shall be blessed.</HI>—Neither is there any Need of supposing, that these Blessings must have their most compleat Accomplishment until many Ages after they were granted, any more than the Blessing on <HI>Japhet,</HI> express'd in those Words, <HI>God shall enlarge</HI> Japhet, <HI>and he shall dwell in the Tents of</HI> Shem.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Noah's</HI> Posterity have such <HI>Blessings</HI> given them through the great <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who suspends &amp; removes the <HI>Curse</HI> which came thrô <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, surely is no Argu∣ment, that they originally, and as they be in their natu∣ral State, are not under the <HI>Curse.</HI> That Men have Bles∣sings <HI>thro' Grace,</HI> is no Evidence of their being not justly exposed to the Curse <HI>by Nature;</HI> but it rather argues the contrary: for if they did not deserve the <HI>Curse,</HI> they would not depend on <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Redemption</HI> for the Re∣moval of it, and for bringing them into a State of Favour with God.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Objection,</HI> which our Author strenuously ur∣ges against the Doctrine of original Sin, is, That it <HI>dispa∣rages</HI> the divine <HI>Goodness</HI> in giving us our <HI>Being;</HI> which we ought to receive with <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> as a great Gift of
<PB N="360" REF="008118_0380_0F6B589C470F4BF8"/>
God's Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficence, and look upon as the first, original and fundamental Fruit of the divine Liberality. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 257, 260, 347,—350.</NOTE></P>
<P>To this I answer, in the following Observations.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Argument is built on the supposed <HI>Truth</HI> of a Thing in <HI>Dispute;</HI> and so is a <HI>begging the Question.</HI> It is built on this Supposition, That we are not properly look'd upon as <HI>one</HI> with our <HI>first Father,</HI> in the State wherein God at first created him▪ and in his Fall from that State. If we <HI>are</HI> so, it becomes the whole Race to acknowledge God's great <HI>Goodness</HI> to them, in the State wherein Mankind was made <HI>at first;</HI> in the <HI>happy</HI> State they were then in, and the fair Opportunity they then had of obtaining <HI>confirmed</HI> and <HI>eternal Happiness;</HI> and to acknowledge it as an Ag∣gravation of their Apostacy; and to humble themselves, that they were so ungrateful as to rebel against their good Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tor.—Certainly, we may all do this with as much (y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, much more) Reason, as the People of <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Da∣niel'</HI>s and <HI>Nehemiah'</HI>s Times, did with Thankfulness acknowledge God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great Goodness to <HI>their Fathers,</HI>many Ages before and in their Confessions bewailed, and took Shame to themselves for, the Sins committed by their <HI>Fathers,</HI> notwithstanding such great Goodness. See the ixth Chapter of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and ixth of <HI>Nehemiah.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If Dr. <HI>T.</HI> would imply in his Objection, that it don't consist with the <HI>Goodness</HI> of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, to give Mankind Being in a State of <HI>Misery</HI> what ever was done before by <HI>Adam,</HI> whether he sinned, or did not sin: I reply, If it be justly so ordered, that there should be a Posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> which must be look'd upon as <HI>one with him,</HI> then 'tis no more contrary to <HI>God▪s</HI> Attribute of Goodness to give Being to his Posterity in a State of Punishment, than to <HI>continue</HI> the Being of the <HI>same</HI> wicked and guilty Person, who has made himself guilty, in a State of Puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment. The giving Being, and the continuing Being are both alike the Work of God's Power and Will, and both are alike
<PB N="361" REF="008118_0381_0F6B589D0358DB78"/>
fundamental to all Blessings of Man's present and future Existence.—And if it be said, It cannot be justly so ordered, that there should be a Posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> which should be look'd upon <HI>one</HI> with him, this is <HI>begging</HI> the <HI>Question.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If our Author would have us suppose, that it is contrary to the Attribute of Goodness, for God, in <HI>any Case,</HI> by an immediate Act of his Power, to cause Exist∣ence, and to cause new Existence, which shall be an ex∣ceeding miserable Existence, by Reason of Exposedness to eternal Ruin; then <HI>his own</HI> Scheme must be supposed <HI>contrary</HI> to the Attribute of God's Goodness: for he sup∣poses, that God will raise Multitudes from the dead at the last Day (which will be giving new Existence to their Bodies, &amp; to bodily Life and Sense) in Order only to their suffering eternal Destruction.</P>
<P N="4">4. Notwithstanding we are so sinful and miserable, as we are by Nature, yet we may have great Reason to bless God, that he has given us our Being under so glorious a Dispensation of <HI>Grace</HI> thrô Jesus Christ; by which we have a happy Opportunity to be <HI>delivered</HI> from this Sin and Misery, and to obtain unspeakable eternal <HI>Happiness.</HI>—And because, thrô our own wicked Inclinations, we are disposed so to neglect &amp; abuse this Mercy, as to fail of final Benefit by it, this is no Reason why we ought not to <HI>bethank∣ful</HI> for it, even according to our Author's own Sentiments. <Q>What (says He <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 349.</NOTE>) if <HI>the whole World lies in Wicked∣ness,</HI> and few therefore shall be saved? Have Men no <HI>Reason</HI> to be <HI>thankful,</HI> because they are wicked and un∣grateful, and abuse their Being and God's Bounty?—Suppose, our own <HI>evil Inclinations</HI> do with-hold us</Q> [<HI>viz.</HI> from seeking after Happiness, which under the Light of the Gospel we are placed within the nearer and easier Reach of] <Q>suppose, the whole Christian World should lie in Wickedness, and but few Christians should be saved; is it therefore certainly true, that we cannot reasonably <HI>thank</HI> God for the Gospel?</Q> Well, &amp; thô the
<PB N="362" REF="008118_0382_0F6B589E2778C450"/>
<HI>evil Inclination,</HI> which hinder our seeking and obtaining Happiness by so glorious an Advantage, are what we are <HI>born</HI> with, yet if those Inclinations are <HI>our Fault</HI> or <HI>Sin,</HI> that alters not the Case: and to say, they are <HI>not</HI> our Sin, is still begging the Question. Yea, it will follow from several Things asserted by our Author, put together, that notwithstanding Men are <HI>born</HI> in such Circumstances, as that they are under a very great <HI>Improbability</HI> of ever be∣coming <HI>righteous,</HI> yet they may have <HI>Reason</HI> to be <HI>thank∣ful</HI> for their Being. Thus, particularly, those that were born and lived among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> before Christ came. For Dr. <HI>T.</HI> asserts, that all Men have Reason of Thank∣fulness for their Being; and yet he supposes, that the <HI>Heathen</HI> World, taken as a collective Body, were <HI>dead in Sin,</HI> and could not deliver or help themselves, and therefore stood in Necessity of the Christian Dispensation. And not only so, but he supposes, that the <HI>Christian</HI> World is now at length brought to the <HI>like</HI> deplorable and helpless Circumstances, and needs a <HI>new</HI> Dispensation for its Relief; as I observed before. According to these Things, the World in general, not only formerly, but even at this Day, are <HI>dead in Sin,</HI> and helpless as to their Sal∣vation; and therefore the Generality of them that are born into it, are much more <HI>likely</HI> to perish, than other∣wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, till the <HI>new</HI> Dispensation comes: And yet he sup∣poses, we all have Reason to be thankful for our Being.—Yea, further still, I think, according to our Author's Doctrine, Men may have great Reason to be <HI>thankful</HI> to God for bringing them into a State, which yet, as the Case is, is attended with <HI>Misery,</HI> as it's <HI>certain</HI> Consequence. As, with Respect to God's <HI>raising</HI> the Wicked to Life, at the last Day; which, he supposes, is in it self a great <HI>Bene∣fit,</HI> procured by <HI>Christ,</HI> and the wonderful <HI>Grace</HI> of God through him: and if it be the Fruit of God's wonderful Grace, surely Men ought to be <HI>thankful</HI> for that Grace, and praise God for it. Our Doctrine of original Sin, therefore, no more disparages God's Goodness in Man's
<PB N="363" REF="008118_0383_0F6B589E930D78D0"/>
<HI>Formation</HI> in the Womb, than <HI>his</HI> Doctrine disparages God's Goodness in their <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the Grave.</P>
<P>Another Argument, which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> makes Use of, against the Doctrine of original Sin, is what the Scripture reveals of the Process of the Day of <HI>Judgment;</HI> which repre∣sents the Judge as dealing with Men <HI>singly</HI> and <HI>separately,</HI> rendring to <HI>every</HI> Man according to <HI>his</HI> Deeds, and accord∣ing to the Improvement he has made of the particular Powers and Talents God has given <HI>him</HI> personally. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 341,—3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. and 387.</NOTE></P>
<P>But this Objection will vanish, if we consider what is the <HI>End</HI> or <HI>Design</HI> of that publick Judgment. Now this will not be, that God may <HI>find out</HI> what Men are, or what Punishment or Reward is proper for them, or in Order to the passing a right Judgment of these Things within him∣self, which is the End of human Trials; but it is to <HI>ma∣nifest</HI> what Men are, to their own Consciences, and to the World. As the Day of Judgment is called <HI>the Day of the</HI> REVELATION <HI>of the righteous Judgment of God;</HI> in Order to this, God will make Use of <HI>Evidences,</HI> or <HI>Proofs.</HI> But the proper Evidences of the Wickedness of Men's <HI>Hearts</HI> (the true Seat of all Wickedness) both as to Cor∣ruption of Nature, and additional Pollution and Guilt, are Men's <HI>Works.</HI></P>
<P>The special End of God's publick Judgment will be, to make a proper, perfect, open <HI>Distinction</HI> among Men, rightly to state and manifest their <HI>Difference</HI> one from a∣nother, in Order to that Separation and Difference in the eternal Retribution, that is to follow: and this Difference will be made to appear, by their <HI>personal Works.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Things, with Regard to which Men will be tried, and openly <HI>distinguished,</HI> by the perfect Judgment of God at the last Day; according to the twofold <HI>real Distinction</HI> subsisting among Mankind: <HI>viz.</HI> (1) The <HI>Difference of STATE;</HI> that <HI>primary</HI> and grand Distin∣ction, whereby all Mankind are divided into two Sorts, the Righteous and the Wicked. (2.) That <HI>secondary Distin∣ction,</HI>
<PB N="364" REF="008118_0384_0F6B589FF82A1510"/>
whereby both Sorts differ from others in the <HI>same</HI> general State, in <HI>DEGREES</HI> of additional Fruits of Righteousness and Wickedness. Now the Judge, in Or∣der to <HI>manifest</HI> both these, will judge Men <HI>according to their</HI> personal <HI>Works.</HI> But to inquire at the Day of Judg∣ment, whether <HI>Adam</HI> sin'd or no, or whether Men are to be look'd upon as one with him, and so Partakers in his Sin, is what in no Respect tends to manifest either of these Distinctions.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>first</HI> Thing to be manifested, will be the <HI>State,</HI> that each Man is in, with Respect to the <HI>grand Distinction</HI> of the whole World of Mankind into <HI>Righteous &amp; Wicked;</HI> or, in metaphorical Language, <HI>Wheat &amp; Tares;</HI> or, the <HI>Children of the Kingdom</HI> of Christ, and the <HI>Children of the Wicked One;</HI> the latter, the Head of the Apostacy; but the former, the Head of the Restoration &amp; Recovery. The Judge, in manifesting this, will prove Men's Hearts by <HI>their Works,</HI> in such as have had Opportunity to perform any Works in the Body. The <HI>evil Works</HI> of the Children of the <HI>wicked One</HI> will be the proper <HI>Manifestation</HI> and Evidence or Proof of whatever belongs to the general State of such; and particularly they will prove, that they be∣long to the Kingdom of the great Deceiver, and Head of the Apostacy, as they will demonstrate the exceeding Cor∣ruption of their Nature, and full Consent of their Hearts to the common Apostacy; and also that their Hearts never relinquished the Apostacy, by a cordial Adherence to Christ, the great Restorer.—The Judge will also make use of the <HI>good Works</HI> of the <HI>Righteous</HI> to shew their In∣terest in the Redemption of Christ; as thereby will be manifested the Sincerity of their Hearts in their Accep∣tance of, and Adherence to the Redeemer and his Righte∣ousness. And in thus proving the State of Men's Hearts by their Actions, the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of those Actions must necessarily come into Consideration, to manifest the true <HI>Quality</HI> of their Actions; as, each one's Talents, Oppor∣tunities, Advantages, Light, Motives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="365" REF="008118_0385_0F6B58A0131CAF58"/>2. The other Thing to be manifested, will be that <HI>se∣condary Distinction,</HI> wherein particular Persons, both Righ∣teous and Wicked, differ from one another, in the <HI>Degree</HI> of secondary Good or Evil, that is something beside what is common to all in the <HI>same</HI> general State: The <HI>Degree</HI> of evil Fruit, which is additional to the Guilt and Corrup∣tion of the whole Body of Apostates and Enemies; And the <HI>Degree</HI> of personal Goodness and good Fruit, which is a secondary Goodness, with Respect to the Righteous∣ness and Merits of Christ, which belong to all by that sincere Faith manifested in all. Of this also each one's <HI>Works,</HI> with their Circumstances, Opportunities, <HI>Talents</HI> &amp;c. will be the proper Evidence.</P>
<P>As to the Nature and Aggravations of the general A∣postacy by <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, and also the Nature and Suffici∣ency of the Redemption by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the great Re∣storer, though both these will have vast <HI>Influence</HI> on the eternal State, which Men shall be adjudged to, yet neither of them will properly belong to the <HI>Trial</HI> Men will be the Subjects of at that Day, in Order to the <HI>Manifesta∣tion</HI> of their <HI>State,</HI> wherein they are <HI>distinguished one from another.</HI> They will belong to the Business of that Day no otherwise, than the Manifestation of the great <HI>Truths</HI> of Religion in general; as the Nature and Perfections of God, the Dependence of Mankind on God, as their Creator and Preserver, &amp;c. Such Truths as these will also have great Influence on the eternal State, which Men will then be adjudged to, as they aggravate the Guilt of Man's Wick∣edness, and must be considered in Order to a due Estimate of Christ's Righteousness, and Men's personal Virtue; yet being of general and equal Concernment, will not proper∣ly belong to the Trial of particular Persons.</P>
<P>Another Thing urged by our Author particularly a∣gainst the <HI>Imputation</HI> of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, is this: <Q>Though, in Scripture, Action is frequently said to be <HI>imputed, reckoned, accounted</HI> to a Person, it is no other than <HI>his own</HI> Act and Deed.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 27<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp;c. 381.</NOTE> In the same Place he cites a
<PB N="366" REF="008118_0386_0F6B58A0C0A23370"/>
Number of Places of Scripture, where these Words are used, which he says are all that he can find in the Bible.</P>
<P>But we are no Way concerned with this Argument at present, any further than it relates to <HI>Imputation of Sin,</HI> or <HI>sinful Action.</HI> Therefore all that is in the Argument, which relates to the present Purpose, is this; That the Word is so often applied in Scripture to signify God's im∣puting personal Sin, but never once to his imputing <HI>A∣dam'</HI>s Sin.—<HI>So often!</HI>—How often?—But <HI>Twice.</HI> There are but two of all those Places which he reckons up, that speak of, or so much as have any Reference to, God's <HI>imputing</HI> Sin to any Person, where there is any E∣vidence that only personal Sin is meant; and they are <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii. 3, 4. &amp; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 16. All therefore the Argument comes to, is this; That the Word, <HI>impute,</HI> is ap∣plied in Scripture, <HI>two</HI> Times, to the Case of God's imputing Sin, and neither of those Times to signify the imputing of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, but both Times it has Reference to personal Sin; therefore <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin is not imputed to his Posterity.—And this is to be noted, that one of these two Places, even that in <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii. 3, 4. don't speak of imputing the Act committed, but another <HI>not</HI> committed. The Words are, <HI>What Man soever there be of the House of</HI> Israel, <HI>that killeth an Ox or Lamb or Goat in the Camp, or that killeth it out of the Camp, and bringeth it not unto the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to offer an Offering unto the Lord, before the Tabernacle of the Lord, Blood shall be</HI> imputed <HI>unto that Man; he hath shed Blood; that Man shall be cut off from among his People,</HI> i. e. plainly, <HI>Murder</HI> shall be imputed to him: He shall be put to Death for it, and therein punished with the same Severity as if he had <HI>stain a Man.</HI> 'Tis plain by <HI>Isai.</HI> lxvi. 3. that in some Cases, a shedding the Blood of <HI>Beasts,</HI> in an unlawful Manner, was <HI>imputed</HI> to them, <HI>as if they slew a Man.</HI></P>
<P>But whether it be so or not, although in both these Pla∣ces the Word, <HI>impute,</HI> be applied to personal Sin, and to the very Act done by the Person spoken of, and in ten
<PB N="367" REF="008118_0387_0F6B58A41BFBD568"/>
more Places; Or altho' this could be said of all the Places, which our Author reckons up; yet that the Word, <HI>Impute,</HI> is never expresly applied to <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, does no more argue, that it is not imputed to his Posterity, than it argues, that Pride, Unbelief, Lying, Theft, Oppression, Persecu∣tion, Fornication, Adultery, Sodomy, Perjury, Idolatry, and innumerable other particular moral Evils, are never imputed to the Persons that commit them, or in whom they are; because the Word, <HI>impute,</HI> tho' so often used in Scrip∣ture, is never applied to any of these Kinds of Wickedness.</P>
<P>I know not what can be said here, except one of these two Things; That thô these Sins are not expresly said to be <HI>imputed,</HI> yet <HI>other</HI> Words are used that do as plain∣ly and certainly <HI>imply,</HI> that they are imputed, as if it were said so expresly. Very well, and so I say with respect to the Imputation of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin. The thing meant by the Word, <HI>impute,</HI> may be as plainly and certainly expressed by using other Words, as if <HI>that</HI> Word were expresly used; and <HI>more certainly,</HI> because the Words used instead of it, may amount to an <HI>Explanation</HI> of this Word. And this, I think, is the very Case here. Thô the Word, <HI>impute,</HI> is not used with respect to <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin, yet 'tis said, <HI>All have sinned;</HI> which, respecting Infants, can be true only of their sinning by his Sin. And, 'tis said, <HI>By his Diso∣bedience many were made Sinners;</HI> and, <HI>Judgment and Condemnation came upon all by that Sin;</HI> and that by this Means <HI>Death</HI> [the Wages of Sin] <HI>passed on all Men,</HI> &amp;c. Which Phrases amount to full and precise Explana∣tions of the Word, <HI>Impute;</HI> and therefore do more cer∣tainly determine the Point really insisted on.</P>
<P>Or, perhaps it will be said, With respect to those perso∣nal Sins fore-mentioned, <HI>Pride, Unbelief,</HI> &amp;c. it is no Argument, they are not <HI>imputed</HI> to those who are guilty of 'em, that the very Word, <HI>impute,</HI> is not applied to 'em; for the <HI>Word</HI> itself is <HI>rarely</HI> used; not one Time in a hundred, and perhaps five hundred, of those wherein the <HI>Thing</HI> meant is plainly implied, or may be certainly in∣fer'd.—Well, and the same also may be replied likewise, with Respect to <HI>Adam'</HI>s Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="008118_0388_0F6B58A4CD67F220"/>'Tis probable, Dr. <HI>T.</HI> intends an Argument against ori∣ginal Sin, by that which he says in Opposition to what R. R. suggests of <HI>Children's discovering the Principles of Ini∣quity, and Seeds of Sin, before they are capable of moral Action.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 353, 354.</NOTE> viz. "That <HI>little Children are made</HI> Patterns <HI>of Humility, Meekness and Innocence,</HI> in Matth. xviii. 3. 1 Cor. xiv. 20. and Psal. cxxxi. 2.</P>
<P>But when the utmost is made of this, there can be no Shadow of Reason, to understand more by these Texts, than that little Children are recommended as Patterns in regard of a <HI>negative</HI> Virtue, Innocence with respect to the <HI>Exercises</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> of Sin, <HI>Harmlesness</HI> as to the hurt∣ful Effects of it, and that <HI>Image</HI> of Meekness and Humi∣lity arising from this, in Conjunction with a natural Ten∣derness of Mind, Fear, Self-diffidence, Yieldableness, and Confidence in Parents and others older than themselves. And so, they are recommended as Patterns of Virtue no more than <HI>Doves,</HI> which are an harmless Sort of Creature, and have an <HI>Image</HI> of the Virtues of Meekness and Love. Even according to Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s own Doctrine, no more can be made of it than this: For <HI>his Scheme</HI> will not admit of any such thing as <HI>positive</HI> Virtue, or virtuous Disposition, in Infants; he insisting (as was observed before) that Vir∣tue must be the Fruit of <HI>Thought</HI> and <HI>Reflexion.</HI> But there can be no Thought and Reflexion, that produces po∣sitive Virtue, in Children, not yet capable of <HI>moral Action;</HI> and it is <HI>such</HI> Children he speaks of. And that little Chil∣dren have a <HI>negative</HI> Virtue or Innocence, in relation to the <HI>positive</HI> Acts and hurtful Effects of Vice, is no Argu∣ment that they have not <HI>corrupt Nature</HI> within them: for let their Nature be ever so corrupt, yet surely 'tis no Wonder that they ben't guilty of <HI>positive</HI> wicked Action, before they are capable of any <HI>moral</HI> Action at all.—A young Viper has a malignant <HI>Nature,</HI> though incapable of doing a malignant Action, and at present appearing a harm∣less Creature.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="008118_0389_0F6B58A5408675E0"/>Another Objection, which Dr. <HI>T.</HI> and some others offer against this Doctrine, is, That <HI>it pours Contempt upon the human Nature.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 350, 351.</NOTE></P>
<P>But their declaiming on this Topic is like addressing the Affections and Conceits of <HI>Children,</HI> rather than rational arguing with <HI>Men.</HI> It seems, this Doctrine is not <HI>complai∣sant</HI> enough.—I am sensible, it is not suited to the Taste of some, who are so very <HI>delicate</HI> (to say no worse) that they can bear Nothing but Compliment and Flattery.—No <HI>Contempt</HI> is by this Doctrine cast upon the noble Fa∣culties and Capacities of <HI>Man's Nature,</HI> or the exalted Business, and divine and immortal Happiness he is made capable of. And as to speaking ill of Man's present <HI>mo∣ral State,</HI> I presume, it will not be denied, that <HI>Shame</HI> belongs to them that are truly <HI>sinful;</HI> and to suppose, that this is not the <HI>native</HI> Character of Mankind, is still but meanly begging the Question. If we, as we come into the World, are truly sinful, and consequently miserable, he acts but a <HI>friendly</HI> Part to us, who endeavours fully to discover and manifest our Disease. Whereas, on the con∣trary, he acts an <HI>unfriendly</HI> Part, who to his utmost hides it from us; and so, in Effect, does what in him lies to pre∣vent our seeking a Remedy from That, which, if not reme∣died in Time, must bring us finally to Shame and <HI>ever∣lasting Contempt,</HI> and end in perfect and remediless De∣struction hereafter.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Objection,</HI> which some have made against this Doctrine, much like the former, is, That it tends to <HI>beget in us an ill Opinion of our Fellow-creatures, and so to promote</HI> Ill-Nature <HI>and</HI> mutual Hatred.</P>
<P>To which I would say, If it be truly so, that we all come <HI>sinful</HI> into the World, then our heartily <HI>acknowledging</HI> it, tends to promote <HI>Humility:</HI> But our <HI>disowning</HI> that Sin and Guilt, which truly belongs to us, &amp; endeavouring to persuade ourselves that we are vastly <HI>better</HI> than in Truth we are, tends to a foolish <HI>Self-Exaltation &amp; Pride.</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="008118_0390_0F6B58A61AA99F60"/>
And 'tis manifest, by Reason, Experience, and the Word of God, that <HI>Pride</HI> is the chief Source of all the <HI>Conten∣tion,</HI> mutual <HI>Hatred,</HI> and <HI>Ill-Will,</HI> which are so prevalent in the World; and that Nothing so effectually promotes the <HI>contrary</HI> Tempers and Deportments, as <HI>Humility.</HI> This Doctrine teaches us to think no worse of others, than of our selves: It teaches us, that we are <HI>all,</HI> as we are by Nature, <HI>Companions</HI> in a miserable helpless Condition▪ which, under a Revelation of the divine Mercy, tends to promote mutual <HI>Compassion.</HI> And Nothing has a greater Tendency to promote those amiable Dispositions of Mercy, Forbearance, Long-suffering, Gentleness and Forgiveness, than a Sense of our own extreme Unworthiness &amp; Misery, and the infinite Need we have of the divine Pity, For∣bearance and Forgiveness, together with a Hope of obtain∣ing Mercy.—If the Doctrine, which teaches that Man∣kind are corrupt by Nature, tends to promote <HI>Ill-will,</HI> why should not Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Doctrine tend to it as much? For he teaches us, that the Generality of Mankind are <HI>very wicked,</HI> having <HI>made themselves so</HI> by their own free Choice, without any Necessity: which is a Way of be∣coming wicked, that renders Men truly <HI>worthy</HI> of <HI>Re∣sentment;</HI> but the other, <HI>not at all,</HI> even according to his own Doctrine.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Exclamation</HI> against this Doctrine is. That it tends to <HI>hinder Comfort</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> and to <HI>promote Melan∣choly</HI> and <HI>Gloominess</HI> of Mind. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 231, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome other Places.</NOTE></P>
<P>To which I shall briefly say, Doubtless, supposing Men are really become sinful, and so exposed to the Dis∣pleasure of God, <HI>by whatever Means,</HI> if they once come to have their Eyes open'd, and are not very stupid, the Reflection on their Case will tend to make them <HI>sorrow∣ful;</HI> and 'tis <HI>fit,</HI> it should. Men, with whom this is the Case, may well be fill'd with Sorrow, till they are sincere∣ly willing to forsake their Sins, and turn to God.—But there is Nothing in this Doctrine, that in the least stands
<PB N="371" REF="008118_0391_0F6B58A738CE0DA0"/>
in the Way of Comfort and exceeding Joy, to such as find in their Hearts a sincere Willingness, wholly to forsake all Sin, and give their Hearts and whole Selves to Christ, and comply with the Gospel-Method of Salvation by him.</P>
<P>Another Thing <HI>objected,</HI> is, That to make Men believe that Wickedness belongs to their very <HI>Nature.</HI> tends to <HI>encourage</HI> them in <HI>Sin,</HI> and plainly to <HI>lead</HI> them to all Manner of Iniquity; because they are taught, that Sin is <HI>natural,</HI> and therefore <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 139, and 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE></P>
<P>But if this Doctrine, which teaches that <HI>Sin</HI> is natural to us, does also at the same Time teach us, that it is <HI>never the better,</HI> or <HI>less to be condemned,</HI> for its being natural, then it don't at all encourage Sin, any more than Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Doctrine encourages Wickedness that is become <HI>invete∣rate;</HI> who teaches, that such as by Custom have contract∣ed strong Habits of Sin, are <HI>unable to help themselves.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his Exposition of Rom. vii.

<P>Our Author is pleased to advance another Notion, among others, by Way of <HI>Objection</HI> against the Doctrine of original Sin; That if this Doctrine be true, <HI>it would be unlawful to beget Children.</HI> He says, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 145.</NOTE> <Q>If natural <HI>Generation</HI> be the Means of unavoidably <HI>conveying</HI> all

Sin and Wickedness into the World, it must <HI>it self</HI> be a <HI>sinful,</HI> and <HI>unlawful</HI> Thing.</Q>—Now, if there be any Force of Argument here, it lies in this Proposition, <HI>What∣soever is a</HI> Means <HI>or</HI> Occasion <HI>of the certain infallible Existence of Sin and Wickedness, must</HI> itself <HI>be sinful.</HI> But I imagine Dr. <HI>T.</HI> had not thoroughly weighed this Proposition, nor considered where it would carry him. For, God's <HI>continuing in Being</HI> the Devil, and others that are finally given up to Wickedness, will be attended, most certainly and infallibly, with an eternal Series of the most hateful and horrid Wickedness. But will any be guilty of such vile Blasphemy, as to say, Therefore God's up∣holding them in Being is it self a <HI>sinful</HI> Thing?—In the same Place our Author says, "So far as we are <HI>generated in Sin,</HI> it is a <HI>Sin</HI> to be generated." [Probably he in∣tended the <HI>active Voice.</HI>] But there is no Appearance of Evidence in that Position, any more than in This; <Q>So far as any is <HI>upheld in Existence</HI> in Sin▪ 'tis a <HI>Sin</HI> to up∣hold them in Existence.</Q> Yea, if there were any Reason in the Case, it would be strongest in the latter Position: For Parents, as Dr. <HI>T.</HI> himself observes, are not the <HI>Au∣thors</HI> of the <HI>Beginning</HI> of Existence: Whereas, <HI>God</HI> is truly the Author of the <HI>Continuance</HI> of Existence. As 'tis the known Will of God, to continue <HI>Satan</HI> and Mil∣lions of others <HI>in Being,</HI> tho' the most sure <HI>Consequence</HI> is the Continuance of a vast infernal World, full of ever∣lasting hellish <HI>Wickedness:</HI> so 'tis Part of the revealed Will of God, that this World of Mankind should be <HI>continued,</HI> and the Species <HI>propagated,</HI> for his own wise and holy Purposes; which <HI>Will</HI> is <HI>complied with</HI> by the Parents joined in lawful <HI>Marriage.</HI> Whose Children, though they come into the World in Sin, yet are capa∣ble Subjects of eternal Holiness and Happiness: Which infinite Benefits for their Children, Parents have great Reason to encourage a Hope of, in the Way of giving up their Children to God in Faith, through a Redeemer, and bringing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. I think, this may be Answer enough to such a Cavil.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="008118_0393_0F6B58A86BC1C070"/>Another <HI>Objection</HI> is, That the Doctrine of original Sin is no <HI>oftner,</HI> and no more <HI>plainly</HI> spoken of in <HI>Scripture;</HI> it being, if true, a very <HI>important</HI> Doctrine. Dr. <HI>T.</HI> in many Parts of his Book suggests to his Readers, that there are very <HI>few Texts,</HI> in the whole Bible, wherein there is the least Appearance of their teaching any such Doctrine.</P>
<P>Of this I took Notice before, but would here say fur∣ther; That the Reader who has perused the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding Defence of this Doctrine, must now be left to judge for himself, whether there be any <HI>Ground</HI> for such an Allo∣gation; whether there be not Texts in <HI>sufficient</HI> Number, both in the old Testament and new, that exhibit undenia∣ble <HI>Evidence</HI> of this great Article of Christian Divinity; and whether it be not a Doctrine taught in the Scripture with great <HI>Plainness.</HI> I think, there are few, if any, Doctrines of Revelation, taught more plainly and expresly. Indeed it is taught in a more and explicit Manner in the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> than the <HI>Old:</HI> Which is not to be won∣der'd at; it being thus with respect to all the most impor∣tant Doctrines of reveal'd Religion.</P>
<P>But if it had been so, that this Doctrine were <HI>rarely</HI> taught in Scripture; yet if we find that it is <HI>indeed</HI> a Thing declared to us by God, if there be good Evidence of its being held forth to us by <HI>any</HI> Word of his, then what be∣longs to us, is, to <HI>believe</HI> his Word,&amp; <HI>receive</HI> the Doctrine which he teaches us; and not, instead of this, to prescribe to him how <HI>often</HI> he shall speak of it, and to insist upon knowing what <HI>Reasons</HI> he has for speaking of it <HI>no oftner,</HI> before we will receive what he teaches us; or that he should give us an Account, why he did not speak of it so <HI>plainly</HI> as we think he ought to have done, <HI>sooner</HI> than he did. In this Way of Proceeding, if it be reasonable, the <HI>Sadducees</HI> of old, who denied any Resurrection or future State, might have maintained their Cause against Christ, when he blamed 'em for <HI>not knowing the Scrip∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures, nor the Power of God:</HI> and for not understanding by the Scripture, that there would be a Resurrection to spiritual Enjoyment, and not to animal Life, and sensual

Gratifications; and they might have insisted, that these Doctrines, if true, were very <HI>important,</HI> and therefore ought to have been spoken of in the Scriptures <HI>oftner</HI> and more <HI>explicitly,</HI> and not that the Church of God should be left, till that Time, with only a <HI>few obscure</HI> Intimations of that which so infinitely concerned them. And they might with Disdain have rejected Christ's Argument, by Way of <HI>Inference,</HI> from God's calling himself, in the Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> the GOD of <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> For Answer, they might have said, That <HI>Moses</HI> was sent on Purpose to teach the People the Mind and Will of God; and therefore, if these Doctrines were true, he <HI>ought in Reason and in Truth</HI> to have taught them plainly and frequently, and not have left the People to spell out so important a Doctrine, only from God's saying, that he was the God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>One great <HI>End</HI> of the <HI>Scripture</HI> is, to teach the World <HI>what Manner of Being</HI> GOD is; about which the World, without Revelation, has been so wofully in the dark: And that <HI>God is an infinite Being,</HI> is a Doctrine of great <HI>Im∣portance,</HI> and a Doctrine sufficiently taught in the Scrip∣ture. But yet, it appears to me, this Doctrine is not taught there, in any Measure, with such <HI>Explicitness</HI> and <HI>Precision,</HI> as the Doctrine of original Sin: and the <HI>Soci∣nians,</HI> who deny God's Omnipresence and Omniscience, have left 'em as much Room for Cavil, as the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> who deny original Sin</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>T.</HI> particularly urges, That <HI>Christ</HI> says <HI>not one Word</HI> of this Doctrine throughout the <HI>four Gospels;</HI> which Doctrine, if true, being so important, and what so nearly concerned the great Work of Redemption, which he came to work out (as is supposed) one would think, <HI>it should have been emphatically spoken of in every Page of the Gospels.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 242, 243.</NOTE></P>

dreadful Threatnings: Which, above all things, tends to search the Hearts of Men, &amp; to teach them their inbred ex∣ceeding Depravity; not meerly as a Matter of Specula∣tion, but by proper Conviction of Conscience; which is the only Knowledge of original Sin, that can avail to pre∣pare the Mind for receiving Christ's Redemption; as a Man's Sense of his own Sickness prepares him to apply in good Earnest to the Physician.</P>
<P>And as to Christ's being no more frequent and particu∣lar in mentioning and inculcating this Point in a <HI>doctrinal</HI> Manner, 'tis probable, one Reason to be given for it, is the same that is to be given for his speaking no oftner of God's <HI>creating the World:</HI> Which, thô so important a Doctrine, is scarce ever spoken of in any of Christ's Dis∣courses: and no Wonder, seeing this was a Matter which the <HI>Jews,</HI> to whom he confined his personal Ministry, had all been instructed in from their Forefathers, and never was called in Question among them.

And <HI>Menasseh Ben. Israel,</HI> in his Preface to <HI>Human Frailty,</HI> says I had a Mind to shew by what Means it came to pass, that when the <HI>first Father</HI> of all had <HI>lost his Righteous∣ness,</HI> his Posterity are begotten liable to the <HI>same Punishment</HI> with him.—And <HI>Munsterus</HI> on the Gospel of <HI>Matthew</HI> cites the following Words, from the Book called <HI>The Bun∣dle of Myrrh: </HI> The Blessed Lord said to the <HI>first Man,</HI> when he cursed him, <HI>Thorns and Thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the Herb of the Field.</HI> The thing which he means, is, That because of <HI>his</HI> Sin <HI>all who should descend from him,</HI> should be wicked and perverse, like <HI>Thorns and Thistles;</HI> according to that Word of the Lord, speaking to the Prophet; <HI>Throns and Irritators are with thee, and thou dwellest among Scorpions.</HI> And all this is from the <HI>Serpent,</HI> who was the Devil, <HI>Sam-macl,</HI> who emitted a mortiferous and corruptive Poison into <HI>Eve,</HI> and became the Cause of Death to <HI>Adam</HI> himself, when he eat the Fruit.—Remarkable is the Place quoted in <HI>Joseph de Voisin,</HI> against <HI>Martin Raymund,</HI> P. 471. of Master <HI>Menachem Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anatensis,</HI> Sect. <HI>Berese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it,</HI> from <HI>Midrasch T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hillim;</HI> which is cited by <HI>Hoornbekius,</HI> against the <HI>Jews,</HI> in these Words; 'Tis no Wonder, that the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> is written and sealed with the King's Ring, and to be propagated to all following Generations; because on the Day that <HI>Adam</HI> was created, all things were finished; so that he stood forth the Perfection and Completion of the whole Workmanship of the World: So when <HI>he</HI> sinned, the <HI>whole World</HI> sinned; whose Sin we bear and suffer. But the Matter is not thus with respect to the Sins of his Posterity.</Q>—Thus far <HI>Stapferus.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these, as <HI>Ainsworth</HI> on Gen. 8. 2. observes, <Q>In <HI>Bereshith Rabba</HI> (a Hebrew Commentary on this Place) a Rabbin is said to be asked, <HI>when is the evil Imagination put into Man?</HI> And he answered, <HI>From the Hour that he is formed.</HI></Q> And in <HI>Pool's</HI> Synopsis it is added, from <HI>Grotius,</HI> <Q>So <HI>Rabbi Salomon</HI> interpret, <HI>Con.</HI> viii 21. <HI>The Imagination of Man's Heart</HI> is <HI>evil from his Youth,</HI> of its being evil from the time that he is taken out of his Mother's Bowels.</Q> <Q><HI>Aben-Ezra</HI> thus interprets <HI>Psal.</HI> li. 5. <HI>I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin dia my Mother conceive me;</HI> That evil Concupiscence is implanted in the Heart from <HI>Childhood,</HI> as if he were <HI>formed</HI> in it; and by <HI>my Mother,</HI> he understands <HI>Eve,</HI> who did not bear Children till she had sin'd. And so <HI>Kafvenaki</HI> says, <HI>How shall I avoid sinning? My</HI> Original <HI>is corrupt, and from thence are those Sins.</HI> So <HI>Manasseh Ben. Israel,</HI> from this Place (<HI>Psal.</HI> li. 5.) concludes, that not only <HI>David,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> Mankind, ever since Sin was introduced into the World, do sin from their <HI>Original.</HI> To this Purpose is the Answer of <HI>Rabbi Hakkad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> which there is an Ac∣count of in the <HI>Talmud.

<P>On these things I observe, there is the greatest Reason to suppose, that these old Rabbies of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, who gave such Heed to the <HI>Tradition of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers,</HI> would never have <HI>received</HI> this Doctrine of <HI>original Sin,</HI> had it not been delivered down to 'em from their <HI>Forefathers.</HI> For it is a Doctrine very disagreable to those practical Principles and Notions, wherein the Religion of the unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> most fundamentally <HI>differs</HI> from the Religion manintained among <HI>Christians:</HI> particularly their Notion of <HI>Justification</HI> by their own Righteousness, and Privileges as the Children of <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> &amp;c. without standing in Need of any Satisfaction, by the Sufferings of the Messiah. On which Account the modern <HI>Jews</HI> do now universally reject the Doctrine of origi∣nal Sin, and Corruption of Nature; as <HI>Stapferns</HI> observes. And it is not at all likely, that the ancient <HI>Jews,</HI> if no such Doctrine had been received by <HI>Tradition</HI> from the Fathers, would have taken it up from the <HI>Christian,</HI> whom they had in such great Contempt and Enmity; especially as it is a Doctrine so peculiarly agreable to the Christian Notion of the <HI>spiritual</HI> Salvation of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and so contrary to their <HI>carnal</HI> Notions of the Messiah, and of his Salvation and Kingdom, and so contrary to their Opinion of themselves; and a Doct∣rine, which Men in general are so apt to be prejudiced a∣gainst. And besides, these <HI>Rabbies</HI> do expresly refer to the Opinion of their <HI>Forefathers;</HI> as, R. <HI>Menasseh</HI> says, <Q>Accrod∣ing to the Opinion of the <HI>ANCIENTS,</HI> none are subject to <HI>Death,</HI> but those which have <HI>sin'd:</HI> for where there is <HI>no Sin,</HI> there is <HI>no Death.</HI></Q> Stapfer. <HI>Tom.</HI> iii. P. 37, 38.</P>
<P>But we have more direct Evidence, that the Doctrine of original Sin was truly a <HI>received</HI> Doctrine amongst the anci∣ent <HI>Jews,</HI> even before the coming of Christ. This appears by ancient <HI>Jewish</HI> Writings, which were written before Christ; as, in the Apocrypha, 2. <HI>Esdras</HI> iii. 21. <Q>For the first <HI>Adam,</HI> having a wicked Heart, transgressed, and was overcome: and so be <HI>all</HI> they that be <HI>born of him.</HI> Thus <HI>Infirmity</HI> was made permanent; and the Law also in the Heart of the People, with the <HI>Malignity</HI> of the Root; so that the <HI>Good</HI> departed away, and the <HI>Evil</HI> abode still.</Q>—2 <HI>Esdras</HI> iv. 30. <Q>For the Grain of <HI>evil Seed</HI> hath been sown in the Heart of <HI>Adam,</HI> from the Beginning; and how much Ungodliness; hath it brought forth unto this Time? And how much shall it yet bring forth, till the time of threshing shall come? And <HI>Chap.</HI> vii. 46.</Q> <Q>It had been better, not to have given the Earth to <HI>Adam;</HI> or else, when it was given, to have restra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d him from sinning: for what Profit is it, for Man now in this present Time, to live in Heaviness, and after Death, to look for Punishment? O thou <HI>Adam,</HI> what hast thou done! For though it was thou that sinned, <HI>thou art not fallen alone,</HI> but <HI>we all that come of thee.</HI></Q> And we read, <HI>Ecclus.</HI> xxv. 24. <Q>Of the Women came the <HI>Beginning of Sin,</HI> and <HI>through her we all die.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As this Doctrine of <HI>original Corruption</HI> was constantly main∣tained in the Church of God from the Beginning's so from thence, in all Probability, as well as from the Evidence of it in universal Experience, it was, that the wiser <HI>Heathen</HI> main∣tained the like Doctrine. Particularly <HI>Plate,</HI> that great Phi∣losopher, so distinguished for his Veneration of antient Tra∣ditions, and diligent Inquiries after them. <HI>Gole,</HI> in his <HI>Court of the Gentiles,</HI> observes as follows; <Q>PLATO says (Gorg. Fol. 493.) <HI>I have heard from the wise Men, that we are now</HI> dead, <HI>and that the Body is but our Sepulchre.</HI> And in his <HI>Timoeus Locrus</HI> (Fol. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) he says, <HI>The C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se of Vitiosity is from our</HI> Parents, <HI>and first Principles, rather than from ourselves. So that we never relinquish those actions, which lead us to follow these primitive Blemishes of our FIRST PA∣RENTS.—Plato</HI> mentions the corruption of the <HI>Will,</HI> and seems to disown any <HI>Free-Will</HI> to <HI>true</HI> Good, albeit he allows some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or natural Dispositions, to <HI>civil</HI> Good, in some great Heroes.—<HI>SOCRATES</HI> asserted the Corruption of human Nature, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>Grotius</HI> affirms, that the Philosophers acknowledged, it was <HI>own natural</HI> to Men, to <HI>sin.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>SENECA</HI> (Benef. 5. 14.) says, <HI>Wickedness has not it's first Beginning in wicked</HI> Practice; <HI>though by that it is first exercised and made manifest.</HI>—And PLUTARCH (de Sera vindicta) says, <HI>Man does not first become wicked, when he first</HI> manifests himself so: <HI>but he hath Wickedness</HI> from the Beginning; <HI>and he</HI> shews <HI>it as soon as he finds Opportunity &amp; Ability.

were generally, in that corrupt Time, very far from a practical Conviction of it; and many Notions were then prevalent, especially among the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> which were indeed inconsistent with it. And thô on Account of these Prejudices they might need to have this Doctrine explain'd and apply'd to them, yet 'tis well known, by all acquainted with their Bibles, that Christ, for wise Reasons, spake more

sparingly and obscurely of several of the most important Doctrines of reveal'd Religion, relating to the Necessity Grounds, Nature and Way of his Redemption, and the Method of the Justification of Sinners, while he lived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Flesh; and left these Doctrines to be more plainly and fully opened and inculcated by the Holy Spirit, after his Ascension.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="008118_0399_0F6B58AFCCD3AD18"/>But if after all, Christ did not speak of this Doctrine often enough to suit Dr. <HI>T—r,</HI> he might be asked, Why he supposes Christ did no <HI>oftener,</HI> and no more <HI>plainly</HI> teach some of <HI>his</HI> (Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s) Doctrines, which he so much insists on? As, That temporal <HI>Death</HI> comes on all Man∣kind by <HI>Adam;</HI> and, That it comes on them by him, not as a Punishment or Calamity, but as a great <HI>Favour,</HI> being

made a rich Benefit, and a Fruit of God's abundant Grace, by Christ's <HI>Redemption,</HI> who came into the World as a se∣cond <HI>Adam</HI> for this End.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>On the whole, I observe, There are some <HI>other</HI> Things, besides Arguments, in Dr. <HI>T—r'</HI>s Book, which are calcu∣lated to influence the Minds, and bias the Judgments of some Sorts of Readers. Here, not to insist on the taking Profession he makes, in many Places, of <HI>Sincerity, Hu∣mility, Meekness, Modesty, Charity,</HI> &amp;c. in his searching after Truth; and freely proposing his Thoughts, with the <HI>Reasons</HI> of them, to others; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Preface, and P. 6. 237, 265, 267, 451.</NOTE> Nor on his magisterial <HI>Assurance,</HI> appearing on many Occasions, and the high <HI>Contempt</HI> the sometimes expresses of the Opinions and Ar∣guments of very excellent Divines and Fathers in the Church of God, who have thought <HI>differently</HI> from him: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 110, 125, 150, 151, 159, 161, 183, 188, 353.</NOTE>
<PB N="383" REF="008118_0403_0F6B58B2D19EBE00"/>
<HI>Both</HI> of which Things, it's not unlikely, may have a De∣gree of Influence on some of his Readers (However, that they may have only their <HI>just</HI> Influence, those Things might properly be compared together, and set in <HI>Contrast,</HI> one with the other)—I say, not to dwell on these Matters, I would take some Notice of another Thing, observable in the Writings of Dr. <HI>T.</HI> and many of the late Opposers of the more peculiar Doctrines of Christianity, tending (especially with <HI>Juvenile</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Readers) not a little to abate the Force, and prevent the due Effect, of the clearest <HI>Scripture-Evidences,</HI> in Favour of those important Doctrines; and particularly to make void the Arguments taken from the Writings of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in which those Doctrines are more plainly and fully revealed, than in any other Part of the Bible. What I mean, is this; These Gentlemen express a <HI>high Opinion</HI> of this Apostle, and that very justly, for his eminent Genius, his admirable Sagacity, strong Powers of Reasoning, acquired Learn∣ing, &amp;c. They speak of him as a Writer—of masterly Address, of extensive Reach, and deep Design, every where in his Epistles, almost in every Word he says. This looks exceeding <HI>specious:</HI> it carries a plausible Ap∣pearance of <HI>Christian Zeal,</HI> and Attachment to the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> in such a Testimony of high Veneration for that great <HI>Apostle,</HI> who was not only the principal Instru∣ment of propagating Christianity, but with his own Hand wrote so considerable a Part of the new Testament. And I am far from determining, with respect at least to some of these Writers, that they are <HI>not sincere</HI> in their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cla∣rations, or that all is meer <HI>Artifice,</HI> only to make Way for the Reception of <HI>their own</HI> peculiar Sentiments. How∣ever, it tends greatly to sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve such a Purpose; as much as if it were designedly contrived, with the utmost Sub∣tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, for that End. Hereby their incautious Readers are prepared the more easily to be drawn into a Belief, that they, and others in their way of thinking, have not <HI>rightly understood</HI> many of those Things in this Apostle's Wri∣tings, which before seem'd very <HI>plain</HI> to them; and they
<PB N="384" REF="008118_0404_0F6B58B38B029A80"/>
are also prepar'd, by a Prepossession in <HI>Favour</HI> of these <HI>new Writers,</HI> to entertain a favourable Thought of the <HI>Interpretations</HI> put by them upon the Words and Phrases of this Apostle; and to admit in many Passages a Meaning which before lay intir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly out of Sight; quite foreign to all that in the View of a common Reader seems to be their obvious Sense; and most remote from the Expositions a∣greed in by those which used to be esteemed the greatest Divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and best Commentators. For they must know, that this Apostle being a Man of no <HI>vulgar</HI> Under∣standing▪ it's nothing strange if his Meaning lies very <HI>deep;</HI> and no Wonder then, if the superficial Discerning and Observation of vulgar Christians, or indeed of the Herd or common Divines, such as the <HI>Westminster∣Assembly</HI> &amp;c. falls vastly short of the Apostle's Reach, and frequently don't enter into the true Spirit and Design of <HI>Paul's</HI> Epistles. They must understand, that the <HI>first Reformers,</HI> and Preachers and Expositors in general, both before and since the Reformation, for fifteen or sixteen Hundred Years past, were too <HI>unlearned</HI> and <HI>short-sighted,</HI> to be capable of penetrating into the Sense, or fit to un∣dertake the making Comments on the Writings of so great a Mans as this Apostle; or else had dwelt in a Cave of <HI>Bigatry</HI> and <HI>Superstition,</HI> too gloomy to allow'em to use their own Understandings with Freedom, in reading the Scrip∣ture. But at the same Time, it must be understood, that there is risen up, now at length in this happy Age of Light and Liberty, a Set of Men, of a more free and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rous Turn of Mind, a more inquisitive Genius, and bet∣ter Discernment. By such Insinuations, they seek Advan∣tage to their Cause; and thus the most unreasonable and extravagant Interpretations of Scripture are palliated and recommended: So that, if the simple Reader is not very much on his Guard, if he don't clearly see with his own Eyes, or has too much Indolence, or too little Leisure, tho∣roughly to examine for himself (as few, alas, are willing to be at the Pains of acquainting themselves so thoroughly with the Apostle's Writings, and of comparing one Part
<PB N="385" REF="008118_0405_0F6B58B4411079E8"/>
of them with another, so as to be fully able to judge of these Gentlemen's Glosses &amp; Pretences) in this Case, he is in Danger of being imposed on with de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sive Appearances; as he is prepared by this fair Pretext of exalting the Sa∣gacity of the Apostle, and by a Parade of Learning, Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣cism, exact Version. Penetration into the true Scope, and Discerning of wonderful Connections, together with the Airs these Writers assume of dictatorial Peremptoriness, and Contempt of old Opinions and old Expositions; I say, such an one is by these Things prepared to swallow strange Doctrine, as trusting to the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>periour Abilities of these modern Interpreters.</P>
<P>But I humbly conceive, their Interpretations, particu∣larly of the Apostle <HI>Paul'</HI>s Writings, thô in some Things ingenious, yet in many Things concerning these great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ticles of Religion, are extremely absurd, and demonstra∣bly disagreable, in the highest Degree, to <HI>his</HI> real Design, to the Language be commonly uses, and to the Doctrines currently taught in his Epistles. Their <HI>Criticisms,</HI> when examined, appear far more subtil, than solid; and it seems as if Nothing can possibly be strong enough Nothing perspicuous enough, in any Composure whatever, to stand before such <HI>Liberties</HI> as these Writers indulge: The plain∣est and most nervous Discourse is analysed and criticized, till it dissolves into Nothing, or till it becomes a Thing of little Significance: The holy Scripture is subtili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed into a meer Mist; or made to evaporate into a thin Cloud, that easily puts on any Shape, and is moved in any Direction, with a Puff of Wind, just as the Manager pleases. 'Tis not in the Nature and Power of Language, to afford suffi∣cient Defence against such an Art, so abused; as I ima∣gine, a due Consideration of some Things I have had Oc∣casion in the preceding Discourse to observe, may abun∣dantly convince us.</P>
<P>But this, with the rest of what I have offered on this Subject of <HI>original Sin,</HI> must be left to every can∣did Reader to judge of, for himself; and the <HI>Success</HI> of the whole must now be left with GOD, who knows
<PB N="386" REF="008118_0406_0F6B58B50A8CC670"/>
what is agreable to his own Mind, and is able to make his own Truths prevail; however mysterious they may seem to the poor, partial narrow and extremely imperfect Views of Mortals, while looking through a cloudy and delusory Medium; and however disagreable they may be to the innumerable Prejudices of Men's Hearts:—And who has promised, that the Gospel of CHRIST, such as is really <HI>his,</HI> shall finally be victorious; and has assured us, that the <HI>Word</HI> which goeth out of his Mouth, <HI>shall not return to him void, but shall accomplish that which he pleaseth, and shall prosper in the thing where to he sends it.</HI>—Let GOD arise, and plead his own Cause, and glo∣rify his own great Name.
