<P>THE Wise Man doth justly condemn the folly of those, that are alwayes saying and complaining, <HI>what is the cause that the former dayes were bet∣ter then these?</HI> Not that he doth approve of a spirit insensible of the evils, Sins, Judgments, De∣generacy of the times wherein we live; only there is in men an aptness to Morose Repinings, like the Poets Old man, <HI>Landator temporis acti, se pu∣cro;</HI> which is not from wisdome; such complaints often proceeding from ignorance in History, or non-observation of the vices in those of former, and virtues in some of the present Generation, who are endued <HI>Antiqua fide, priscis moribus.</HI> And for any upon this ground to murmure at the providence of God, for casting their lot to fall into an age of troubles, as if the most High did not ballance humane affairs, with such an equal distribution of blessings as ought to be, is foolish Arrogance in wretched Mortals, so to take upon them, to teach him whose ways are unsearchable.

The present Aspect of Providence is dismal on more accounts then one; especially in that God hath been removing the Pillars of this Generati∣on, even those that have stood in the Gap, and would have done much towards keeping out a Deluge of overflowing Judgments. It is not ten years since <HI>Mitchel</HI> died (not to speak of o∣thers whom this Generation lost at that time, for one such stroke seldome goeth alone) and all New-England shook when that Pillar fell to the ground. <HI>For all this, his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still:</HI> Of late he that holds the Stars in his right hand, hath caused some of our brightest Lights to set; and is not that a sign of darkness to follow? Such Rebukes of God make the Pillars of Heaven to tremble. And what shall we say, when the Lord is threat∣ning to dry up that fountain, whose streams have made glad the City of God? Poor <HI>New-En∣gland!</HI> Shall the day come, when there will be none to guide thee, of all the Sons thou hast brought forth? Doubtless, the Lord will not as yet, wholly cast off a Generation that are the Po∣sterity of his faithfull Servants, that forsook all for Christ, and that they might leave their Chil∣dren under the blessed wings of the Lord, Jesus.

<P>As for the ensuing <HI>Discourse,</HI> if the Reader expect any thing rare, or curious therein, he will find himself disappointed. I neither can if I would, nor am I willing to doe what I can, in such a way. I would rather let the world see, that I am of <HI>Luthers</HI> judgement, who judged him the ablest Preacher <HI>quipueriliter, trivialiter, populariter, sim∣plicissimèdocet.</HI> And it is a comfort to think, that such <HI>Simple Discourses,</HI> which they that account themselves the Wits of the World, look upon as <HI>Babling,</HI> will either be blessed by Christ for the Conversion and Edification of Souls, or turn for a Testimony to the Speaker. And what can a Christian desire more, then to be unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved &amp; in them that perish? And that after he is fallen asleep, and gathered unto his Fathers, others shall bear witness that be served his own Generation according to the will of God?</P>
<P>Some years are past, since notice was given of this intended Publication, (and indeed since these Sermons (such as they are) were both preached, and thus transcribed) If I had had nothing else to mind, but what is here presented, doubtless it would not have stuck in the birth so long:

<BIBL>1. Chron. 28. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>If thou seek him he will be found of thee.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOd in his Providence doth many times so order, as that <HI>the last words</HI> of his eminent Servants shall be of most weighty consideration. The Scripture sets a special Emphasis and Remark upon the last words of David, 2 Sam. 23. 1. <HI>now these are the last words of David-the sweet singer of Israel,</HI> not that he never spake any words after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but they were expressed by him, toward the close of his dayes, not very long before he le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the world. The same is to be said concerning the words now be∣fore us; They are amongst <HI>the last,</HI> yea, the dying speeches of that holy man of God; who perceiving that the time of his departure was at hand, laveth'a most solemn charge upon his son Solomon, that he should endeavour to approve himself a faithful Ser∣vant
<PB N="2" REF="000274_0009_0FA4583F96BF16F0"/>
of his Fathers God. Several Arguments are made use of to back this charge; one is in these words, taken from the benefit which would attend a sincere seeking the Lord. <HI>If thou seek him, be will be found of thee;</HI> that is to say, thou shalt then be made happy in the enjoyment of God for ever. If others seek God in sincerity of heart, they shall find him, but (saith David ) it is eminently true concerning thee, because the Lord hath been thy Fathers God. Thou art a child of a Father that had a special inte∣rest in God, and therefore if thou set thy self to seek him, know for thy encouragement, that he will be most ready, to shew himself favourable to thee, wherefore the Doctrine which may at present be in∣sisted on from the words, is,</P>
<P><HI>That the Children of godly Parents are under peculiar advantages and encouragements to seek the Lord.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctr.</HI></NOTE> For the clearing of this Doctrine, two things may be at∣tended, 1. To enquire what is implyed in this seeking the Lord which the Text speaketh of? 2. How it doth appear that the Children of godly Parents are under peculiar advantages and encou∣ragement so to do?</P>
<P><HI>Qu. 1. What is implyed in this seeking the Lord?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. 1. It doth imply that men by nature are such as have lost God.</HI> The sinner hath lost himself, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15. 32. <HI>this thy brother was lost, and is found,</HI> yea, and he hath lost God too. He is wandred from his Fathers house. Hence the Apostle said to the Ephesians, <HI>they were without God in the World.</HI> Yea, it is true concerning. Children of godly Parents as well as others, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 3. <HI>we</HI> (saith the holy Apostle) <HI>were by nature the Chil∣dren of wrath even as others.</HI> We that are Jews and descended of holy Ancestors, we that are con∣verted, and made Apostles of Christ, by nature were Subjects of the wrath and righteous displeasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="000274_0010_0FA45841425BE5A8"/>
God. Not but that some of the Children of godly men, have grace wrought in them whilest in a state of Infancy, as John Baptist was filled with the holy Ghost from his mothers womb, but they do not de∣rive that grace from their Parents, and therefore it is not natural but supernatural, when any of the Children of sinful men are made gracious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Seeking the Lord doth imply a sense of this lost con∣dition.</HI> Sense of want puts men upon seeking. The Prodigal was hunger-bitten before he would seek to be reconciled to his Father, when he saw that he was feign to live upon husks, and that there was no way but he must perish with hunger, except he sought unto his Father for a supply, he would do so. If a man hath lost a thing, except he know that he hath lost it, he will not seek after it. Hence in the Parable concerning the lost piece of silver, it is said, <HI>what woman if she lose a piece of silver, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it,</HI> Luk. 15. 8. So that there must be sense of loss before there will be seeking or finding. Nor will men seek the Lord, except they be by his Spirit made sensible, that they have lost his favour, and are through sin and the fall become miserable.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This seeking doth imply earnest desire to find God.</HI> That which a man seeketh after he would be glad to find. When Job sought after Communion with God, he maketh enquiry, <HI>where shall I find him,</HI> Job. 23. 3. No one will seek after that which is not an Object of his desires, Psal. 27. 4. <HI>One thing have I desired, that will I seek after.</HI> If thou seek him, that is to say, if thou earnestly desire to find the Lord, then so it shall be. If God be the chief Object of thy de∣sires, if the desire of thy Soul be towards the remem∣brance of his Name, then he will be found of thee. As it was with David himself, <HI>Psal.</HI> 63. 1. <HI>O God thou
<PB N="4" REF="000274_0011_0FA45841ACBA4588"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will I seek thee; my Soul thirsteth so thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirsty Land Where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is.</HI> How are the desires and affecti∣ons on a thirsty man carryed out after water, in a thirsty Land where no water is a when the desires of the Soul are in like manner carryed ont after God, that is seeking him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Seeking the Lord doth imply diligence in the use of means in order to obtaining the favour of God.</HI> The end implies the means which is necessary in order to obtaining that end, now the favour of God is the end of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hence 'tis called a seeking his face, <HI>i. e.</HI> his fa∣vour, <HI>Ps.</HI> 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4. <HI>Seek the Lords face,</HI> &amp; the means in or∣der to obtaining that end, is Repentance of former sins, Faith in the righteousness of Jesus Christ, (<HI>Jer.</HI> 50. 8.) walking according to the holy Rules of the Word of God, which is therefore called <HI>a walking in all well Pleasing before the Lord,</HI> inasmuch as so to walk is the way to find the continuance of divine favour.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Seeking the Lord doth imply the worship and service of God.</HI> As they that do not worship God are said to be such as seek him not; <HI>Isai</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 7. <HI>I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them that sought me not,</HI> meaning that the Gentiles, who in former times did not own and worship the true God, should be brought to the knowledge of him. So to seek God is to worship him, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 11. 76. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, <HI>that such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel,</HI> i. e. to worship him, <HI>came to Jerusa∣lem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their Fathers.</HI> It is true, that in special that great duty of Prayer (which is a special part of religious worship) is in∣tended, yet not that only; all other parts of divine worship are comprehended under this expression. Hence it is in the Context noted by that of <HI>serving the Lord.</HI> Now to serve God is to worship him al∣right. <HI>We</HI> (said they in Ezra) <HI>are the Servants of the
<PB N="5" REF="000274_0012_0FA45844369488C0"/>
God of Heaven,</HI> meaning that they did worship none else but him, so that a Servant of the Lord is the same with a worshipper of him. This <HI>seeking</HI> is here set in opposition to <HI>forsaking</HI> God. Now for∣saking hath special respect to that sin of Idolat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and false worship, David was a man that was very faithful to God in the matters of his worship. As for Idols, he would not so much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4. And we read in the sacred History of David, that when he had subdued his Enemies, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Images and Idols; in an holy indignation at the sin of Idolatry. Now he doth exhort his Son Solo∣mon, to follow his Fathers steps in being to all to God in the matters of his worship. All these parti∣culars may be intended here, <HI>If thou seek the Lord,</HI> i. e. If thou art sensible of thy lost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by nature, so as to desire reconciliation with God in the first place, and do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t therefore repent of sin, and believe in Christ, and continuest to worship, and serve God, according to his own will, then be assured that thou shalt enjoy his favour, and be everlastingly blessed.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> We come now to the second thing propounded, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>To shew how it doth appear that the Children of godly Parents are under peculiar advantages and encou∣ragement to seek the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans. In that the vein of Election, doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> though the Joyns of godly Parents for the most part.</HI> Though it be not Wholly, and only so, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lect Parents have none but elect Children, or that elect Children are al∣wayes born of elect parents <NOTE N="[a]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. ster∣bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Cov p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> &amp; D <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fant P. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> yet God hath seen meet to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the line of Election so, as that generally elect Children are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon elect Parents, John, di∣rects one of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, To the elect Lady and her Children, whom he also found walking, in the Truth. Not only the Mother, but the Children did belong to God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> that if the mother be elect, at 
<PB N="6" REF="000274_0013_0FA45845B5C434B8"/>
least wise some of the Children are so too. There are many Scriptures which do intimate this truth, Psal. 105. 8. <HI>He hath remembred his Covenant for ever the word which be commanded to a thousand gene∣rations.</HI> Intimating both that the longer a genera∣tion doth continue godly, the more gracious will the Lord be to the Seed and posterity, and that there are some that in a continued Succession for many generations the Lord hath chosen. Hence Psal. 103. 17. <HI>The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everla∣sting upon them that fear him, and his Righteousness unto Childrens Children.</HI> Shewing that God from Eter∣nity hath designed mercy to some Parents and to their Children, and their Childrens Children, Isai. 69. 20. <HI>my Spirit which is upon thee, &amp; my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the Lord, from hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; for ever.</HI> To the same purpose is that, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37. 25. what more plain can be spoken, to shew that God doth many times cast elect Children upon elect Parents in a continued Succession from generation to generation? See also Isai. 65. 22, 23, <HI>Mine Elect and their off-spring with them are the blessed of the Lord.</HI> So that when Parents are Elect, usually their Chil∣eren are so too. Hence it was said to Zacheus, <HI>Salva∣tion is come to thy house,</HI> Luk. 19. 9. Not only to his Soul. but to his house. Vsually if God intends to save a man, there are some of his house, <HI>i. e.</HI> posterity, that are heirs of salvation also. And therefore the Apostle said to the Jaylor▪ <HI>believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thy house, Acts</HI> 16. 31. How did Paul know that if the Jaylor believed his Children should be saved? was it from any special Revelation concerning those Children more then with respect unto others? no; but he knew, that when God brought the Father into a state of Salvati∣on,
<PB N="7" REF="000274_0014_0FA458464D3C2730"/>
he was wont to save however some of his Chil∣dren and posterity. Hence also Paul said to Timo∣thy, <HI>when I call to remembrance the unfeigned Faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grand-mother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am perswaded in thee also,</HI> 2 Tim. 1. 5. He doth probably and hopefully conclude, that Timothy did belong to God, because he was the Son of a godly mother and Grand-mother. Moreover, experience and observation doth confirm this truth, that <HI>de facto</HI> it hath been so. For the Elect are not found in all places alike, but in some Nations more then in others, and that for many Generations suc∣cessively. And in some Families more then in others. There are some Families in the World, that God hath designed to shew peculiar mercy to them, from generation to generation. And if an account should be taken concerning all the godly men that are now alive in the world, doubtless it would be found, that, the greatest part of them are sprung from godly Parents. Though there may be many converted ones in the world, whose Parents did not fear God, yet for the generality of true believers they are, such as have descended from believing Parents,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord hath established his Covenant not only with Parents, but with Children also.</HI> Gen. 17. 7. <HI>I will establish my covenant between me &amp; thee, and thy seed af∣ter thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee &amp; to thy seed after thee,</HI> The Saints in all ages are concerned in Abrahams covenant, under which children are comprehended. To say that the Covenant was extended to Children under the Old Testament, but not under the New, is to lessen the grace of God in these dayes of the Gospel. Yea then the Jews would haye been great loosers by, believing on Christ. If they could have said, in for∣mer times our Children were interested in the gra∣cious

Covenant of God, but if we imbrace the Gos∣pel, they shall have no part in the Lord, this would have been such an objection against beleiving as could never have been answered. Wherefore, we shall find that those Scriptures which relate to Gos∣pel times, expresly declare, That not only Believers themselves, but their children also, are subjects of the Lords gracious covenant with his people. Isai. 61. 8. 9. <HI>I will make an everlasting covenant with them and their Seed shall be known among the Gentiles, &amp; their off-spring among the people, all that see them shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at-Knowledge, that they are the seed which the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blessed.</HI> And Chap. 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 23. <HI>They are the Seed of the Blessed of the Lord, and their off spring with them.</HI> Now this consideration is a great encouragement to seek the Lord. So it was to them, Jer. 3. 22. <HI>We come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</HI> We are thy Covenant people, and that doth encourage us to come unto thee. And this did encourage David to seek and hope for the Lords salvation. Psal. 86. 16. <HI>Save the son of thine handmaid.</HI> And the Apostle did encourage the Jews to repent and return unto the Lord, from this argument, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in that they were <HI>the children of the covenant.</HI> Act. 3. 19, 25. From thence it is evident, that the children of godly Parents stand in a peculiar relation unto God, &amp; that therefore he will not cast them off, except there be great cause for it. Not surely as long as they seek him, and de∣sire to return to him and serve him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There are special promises belonging to such chil∣dren.</HI> Not only the Covenant in general which is, as it were, a Constellation of glorious promises, but there are peculiar Promises made concerning them. There is a promise that they shall be blessed above other children. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="9" REF="000274_0016_0FA4584879C7A810"/>
<HI>Generation of the upright shall be blessed.</HI> And that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from one generation to another. Psal. 102. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. <HI>The children of thy servants shall continue, and their feed shall be established before thee.</HI> In another place, David speaking concerning the children of Gods ser∣vants, and that in the dayes of the Messiah, saith, <HI>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all serve him it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</HI> Psal. 22. 30. intimating that the Lord will uphold among the children of his people a cer∣tain number that shall be owned as a race of Gods Children. And therefore we have a promise of converting grace to be bestowed on such children. Deut. 30. 6. <HI>The Lord the God will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed.</HI> There is a promise for grace as well as to grace, as to those that belong to the e∣lection of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Circumcision of heart implyeth Regeneration, which is promised to the Lords Ser∣vants with respect unto their children. And that was one reason why the Lord did of old appoint Cir∣cumcision to be applyed to the children of his peo∣ple, that so this promise of converting grace in due time to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might be sealed. The same thing is promised, Isai. 44. 3. <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my blessing upon thine off spring.</HI> And the Lord hath made a blessed promise of salvation to such children, Isai. 49. 25. <HI>I will save thy children.</HI> Hence it is promised that <HI>the seed of the Lords Ser∣vants shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Psal. 69. 36. Which word is made good in these dayes of the Gospel, by giving heaven to the children of beleivers as their everla∣sting inheritance. Now albeit these promises doe not absolutely respect all the children of every god∣ly man, only the elect amongst them, yet they are generally and indefinitely propounded; and that is encouragement as to Parents to pray for their chil∣dren▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them, as it was to David, 1.

<HI>O my God, thou hast told thy servant, thou wilt build him an house, therefore thy Servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. And now Lord, thou art that God that hast promised this goodness to thy servant, now therefore let it please thee to bless the house</HI> (i. e. the family and Posterity▪) <HI>of thy Servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou blessest O Lord and it shall be blessed for ever.</HI> So it is a wonderfull encouragement to the Children of holy men, to seek unto the Lord for grace and Salvation for themselves. The child of a godly man may come before the Lord, and say, Lord thou hast promised to bestow grace, and give eter∣nal blessings unto those that are the children of such as fear thy name, my Father, my Mother thou know∣est did fear thy name, why then may not that pro∣mise belong to me?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The children of godly parents are the subjects of much faithfull prayer.</HI> David prayed earnestly for his Son Solomon, 1 Chron. 29. 19. &amp; 22, 16. So did Isaac for his son Jacob. Gen. 28. 1, 3, 4. Now it is matter of great encouragement, that prayer is go∣ing: especially the prayers of godly parents will doe much in order to obtaining mercy for their children. For they have a great natural affection toward their Children, which when it is sanctified, maketh them to be the more earnest with the Lord for them. If a Child were to ask prayers for his life, let him de∣sire the prayers of his Father, if his Father be indeed one that hath an Interest in Heaven. It is said in the fifth Commandment, <HI>Honour thy Father, and thy Mo∣ther, that thy dayes may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,</HI> Exod 20, 12, because as for dutiful Children, their Parents are engaged to pray much for them, and by that means do lengthen out their dayes. In the Hebrew it is, <HI>they shall prolong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dayes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> thy Father and thy Mother shall do so.

How should they do it? <NOTE N="[b]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr. Owen on Ps. 130 p. 218.</HI></NOTE> even by praying for their Posterity, and blessing them in the Name of the Lord, and by that means prolonging their dayes not only upon the Earth, but to Eternity in Heaven, of which that Land of Canaan was a Type. The prayers of godly parents have a great influence and Interest in obtaining blessings temporal, spiritu∣al, and eternal for their Children. Abrahams pray∣ers for Ishmael prevailed farr, and his prayers fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Isaac prevailed further. <HI>Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee, and God said, as for Ishmael I have heard thee, behold I have blessed him, but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac,</HI> especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Pa∣rents pray in faith. As sometimes a father hath a par∣ticular Faith for such a Child. As to those that have much communion with God, and know much this mind, many times it is so, that a believing Parent can say, as for such a Child I know he shall be blessed and made a blessing. I have surely prevailed with God for him. As Isaac said of Jacob, Gen. 27. 33. <HI>I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed,</HI> so a godly Pa∣rent can sometimes say, such a Child of mine, Christ hath blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed for ever. Now this is a great encouragement to Chil∣dren, that Prayer and Faith hath been acting for them. Yea, that a Stock of prayers hath been laid up for them. Is it not a great encouragement unto a Child, when he can say, my gracious Father hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arried my Name before God in secret many a thou∣sand time, even every day and night since I was born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the world? certainly these prayers shall not all to the ground.</P>

young ones especially. A Father that walketh with God may say to his Children as Paul to the Corin∣thians, unto whom he was a spiritual Father, 1 Cor. 4. 45, 16. <HI>In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel; wherefore I beseech you be you followers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> And again, Chap. 11. 1. <HI>Be you followers of me, even as I also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Christ.</HI> So may a Father that walk∣eth before God as he ought to do, say to his Chil∣dren, observe my Example, and follow me as I fol∣low Christ. Or as the same Apostle said to Timothy <HI>thou hast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrine and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of life,</HI> 2 Tim, 3. 10. Timothy was intimate with Paul, and there∣fore doubtless knew more of his secret way of walk∣ing and Communion with God, then was known or imagined by the World, so do Children observe more of their Parents holy course of life, then others do, which is no sin all advantage. A Child is wit∣ness of his Fathers Zeal, Faith, Patience; he seeth that his Father is conscientious and holy, and much in prayer to God. Now what an advantage is this? He needs not go farr to see how he ought to walk and please God, for he seeth it before his eyes every day, by the Example and Copy his Father sets be∣fore him. Moreover, it is a great encouragement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the Child of a godly Parent, when he can think and say, my Father did serve God and the Lord ac∣cepted of him, therefore if I serve God, he will ac∣cept of me. My Father did repent and believe, and walk in the way of holiness, God blessed him and his Family; therefore if I walk in the steps of my Fathers faith and obedience, <HI>the God of my Father</HI> will bless me and mine for ever.</P>

But it is more rare for such Children ever to repent; and if they do not repent they shall be punished for their Fa∣thers and Mothers sins as well as for their own, be∣cause they justify them by doing like them. How many Examples are there recorded in the Scripture of Gods punishing Children with their Parents and because of their sin? So Achans Children, and Da∣than's and Abiram's; yea, millions of Children that were drowned and damned with their cursed Pa∣rents in Noahs flood, and when Sodom and Gomor∣rah was destroyed; not only the Parents, but the Children perished, and now suffer together the vengeance of Eternal fire; and was not an expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charge given concerning the little ones of the Ama∣lekites, Midianites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they should be de∣stroyed with their Fathers? thus doth the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the iniquity of the Fathers into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Children.</P>

of my Father Isaac.</HI> He was greatly encouraged in looking up to God from that very consideration, that the Lord was the God of his Father, and God of his Grand-Father. So Moses, <HI>Exod.</HI> 18. 4. <HI>The God of my Father was my help, and delivered me from the Sword of Pharaoh,</HI> and David, <HI>Psal.</HI> 116. 16; <HI>O Lord truly I am thy Servant; I am thy Servant, the son of thy Hand∣maid.</HI> Inasmuch as his mother was a pretious god∣ly woman, he was encouraged to plead his Interest in God. So Solomon; 1 King. 8. 57. <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers, let him not leave us nor forsake us.</HI> Inasmuch as the Lord was their fa∣thers God, Solomon and the Lords people with him had their hearts drawn forth to hope that he would be their God also, so as never to forsake them.

To be under the wing of the Covenant, though but as to the external dispensation of it, is in it self a mercy.

greatest gift that ever was bestowed on the world; now this the children of godly Parents are wont to enjoy; Timothy being descended from a godly mo∣ther and grand-mother, even from a child knew the Scriptures, 2. Tim. 3. 15. To enjoy the word and Ordinances of God publickly dispensed is a great mercy; it is therefore mentioned as such a blessing as is enough to make amends for many sorrows and afflictions, <HI>Thine eyes shall behold thy Teachers,</HI> Isai. 30. 20. This is wont to be the portion of godly mens Children. And to have the benefit of private in∣structions, admonitions, exhortations is a great mercy; Solomon confesseth that his Father and his mother taught him good doctrine: Prov. 4. 2. It was good because for his everlasting benefit and ad∣vantage. Nor are the children of godly men with∣out this benefit, Psal. 34. 11. <HI>Come you Children heav∣en unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> It is a great mercy to be taught and principled in the fear of God, and that betimes; to be told of the e∣vil of sin, the infinite danger of dying in a natural unconverted estate, the necessity of obtaining an interest in Christ, and to be directed in the right way to Salvation. Also to be the subjects of much prayer is great mercy; it is mentioned concerning Solomon as a special favour God would vouchsafe to him, Psal. 72. 15. <HI>Prayer shall be made for him con∣tinually.</HI> Thus concerning the children of the Lords people, the publick prayers of the Church reach them, and their godly parents are daily praying for them; so that prayer is made for them continually. Moreover, such children experience outward bles∣sings and preservations for their parents sake. It is said concerning him that feareth God, <HI>His chil∣dren shall find a place of Refuge,</HI> Prov. 14. 26. And the Lord said to Abraham concerning Ishmael, <HI>Gen.</HI>

Answ. This is sadly true sometimes; the most high to shew the Soveraignty of his grace, sometimes chuseth some of the Children of a wick∣ed Parent, and refuseth some of a godly Parent; Also to shew that it is not in the power of men to give grace, no not in the power of godly men, so much as to their own Children; sometimes such Children prove very unlike unto their godly Parents. It was therefore said to Samuel, <HI>thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do not walk in thy wayes,</HI> 1 Sam. 8. 5. And that pro∣phane <HI>Jehojakim</HI> how unlike was lie to his blessed.

Yet this is sur∣ther to be added and considered, that when the Chil∣dren of good men are unlike their Parents in grace and holiness, it proceeds not from any unfaithfulness in the blessed God as to his Covenant with such Pa∣rents, or with their Children, for</P>
<P N="1">1. Vsually it is some evill in such parents (though otherwise godly) which the Lord doth punish in their Children, Either they are not so diligent in teaching and instructing them as they ought to be; If we must judge all those parents ungodly whose children are miserably instructed, I am certain that many amongst us, who have a name to live, and would be thought to have the root of the matter in them, will be found amongst the ungodly. Or Parents are sinfully indulgent towards their chil∣dren; so was Eli; indeed he instructed them, told them of the evil of those wayes they walked in, and exhorted them to reform, but he corrected and re∣strained them not; Isaac was too indulgent towards his profane Esau; so was David towards Absolom, that afterwards proved a Rebel, rising up in arms against his own Father; and he did sinfully indulge Adonijah; the Scripture taketh notice of it, that <HI>his Father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so?</HI> 1 King. 1. 6. No wonder he came to such an unhappy end, for usually such children are first or last a shame to the Father that begat them, and bitterness to the mother that bare them. Or it may be parents doe not pray and believe for their Children as they ought to doe: God in this case sometimes saith unto parents, according to your faith be it done unto you. If you pray much, and
<PB N="18" REF="000274_0025_0FA45856B55605B0"/>
believe much for your children, you shall obtain much mercy from the Lord for them. Psal. 33. last.</P>
<P N="2">2 Many times the children of godly men are like their parents. In some godly Familyes all the chil∣dren of the family are made partakers of convert∣ing saving grace. So in Jacobs Family; there is rea∣son to believe that his twelve sons did repent before they died, and that they are now in heaven, conside∣ring that they were Types of the Elect of God, and their names were written upon the breast of the high priest, when he entred into the Holy of Holyes. So concerning Jobs children; the Scrip∣ture saith, that after the death of his children and the loss of his estate, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before, yet he had but ten chil∣dren after that, which was the number he had be∣fore, wherefore Interpreters probably conclude that his other children were not lost; they might all goe to heaven notwithstanding the sad and sudden death which befel them. And experience confirmeth the truth of this, we see that in some families God is pleased to bestow converting grace upon all the children therein; especially if their parents be very much in prayer to God for them. I remember I once heard an holy praying man say, my father had six children, and they are all either with Christ, or in Christ; and he hath given me six children, three of them are already with Christ, and the other (I bless his name) are in Christ. And I have read <NOTE N="[c]" PLACE="marg"><HI>v. Full filling of Scriptures</HI> P. 442.</NOTE> of one who held much communion with God, that once said to an intimate friend, <HI>I have this day abtained mercy from God not only for myself, but for all mine,</HI> and evident signs of regenerating grace did afterwards appear in all his Children.</P>
<P N="3">3. God is wont to remember and establish his covenant with some of the children of his Servants
<PB N="19" REF="000274_0026_0FA4585785E59CF0"/>
however; if not to all, yet with some of them. It is commonly seen that as for wicked Parents though they have many Children they are all ungodly like their Parents; but it is seldome known that if a god∣ly man hath many Children that they all prove wicked; first or last God converts some of them. If there be an Ishmael in Abrahams Family, there is also an Isaac; if there be an Esau in Isaac's Family, there is also a Jacob; if there be an Absolom in Da∣vids Family, there is also a Solomon; nor ought we to doubt, but that Nathan and many more of Da∣vids Children are now in Heaven, albeit three of them perished.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the Lord cast off the immediate Seed, he re∣members his Covenant to others that are more re∣mote. Esau was hated, yet it is conceived by learn∣ed men that <HI>Job</HI> and his godly friends were of Isaacs posterity by <HI>Esau.</HI> <NOTE N="[d]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Voeti∣us disp. de Gentilis∣mc. p.</HI> 603</NOTE> <HI>Samuels</HI> son <HI>Joel</HI> was not like his Father, but his grand-child <HI>Heman</HI> was an excel∣lent Prophet like his blessed grand-Father; yea, and many of Samuels great grand-Children, were faith∣ful Ministers in the house of God, 1 Chron. 6. 33. and 25. 5, 6. The Lord hath sometimes cast off a few ge∣nerations, and yet at last remembers his Covenant made with blessed Ancestors; Jer. 31. 17. <HI>There is hope in thine end,</HI> (h. e. as to after generations there is hope) <HI>saith the Lord, that thy Children shall come again to their own border.</HI> There is then cause to nourish hope concerning such Children; there is so with re∣spect to succeeding generations in <HI>New-England;</HI> Albeit there is doleful degeneracy appearing in the face of this generation, and no man can say, but that the body of the present generation will perish both temporally and eternally, yet there are some that the Lord will remember his Covenant with, even a remnant according to Election that shall be saved.

<P N="1">1. That they be in a state of grace themselves; that they have a special and saving Interest in God. As David said to his son Solomon, 1 Chron. 28. 20. <HI>The Lord God, even my God will be with thee;</HI> So if you can, upon good grounds say, <HI>the Lord is my God,</HI> you may the better hope that he will be with your Children. If you be indeed righteous in the sight of God, it will be your poor Childrens advantage; Psal. 37. 25. <HI>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his Seed beg∣ging bread.</HI> But if you be unconverted, and Christ∣less, what a case are your Children in? That if they be in any distress, they have a Father that cannot pray for them, or if he do, his prayers find no accep∣tance with God, because they proceed from one that hath not an interest in Heaven; Remember that Scripture, Deut. 5. 29. <HI>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments alwayes, that it might be well with them, &amp; with their Children for ever;</HI> plainly intimating that if Parents truly fear God, their children shall fare the better for it; Yea, let me tell you, that then if any of them dye in their Infancyes, <NOTE N="[e]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr Whiston's primitive practice of Infant Bap∣tisme.</HI></NOTE> you need not doubt of their Salvation, Deut. 30. 19. <HI>Thou and thy Seed shall live.</HI> God having taken your Children in∣to a Covenant of life, if they never break that Co∣venant, shall they not live for ever? yea, they shall live for ever.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="000274_0028_0FA45858F6743368"/>2. Parents should be careful what opinions they embrace. For oftentimes the poison of a corrupt o∣pinion in the Father proveth baneful to the Child; As Naamans Leprosy went down from Generation to Generation, so the plague of spiritual Leprosy in the Head, is sometimes propagated from the Father to the Son.</P>
<P N="3">3. Parents should be careful of their conversati∣on; because their Children are apt to follow their Example, especially in that which is evil. As it's no∣ted of Ahaziah, that he walked in the way of his Fa∣ther and of his Mother, 1 King. 22. 52. And of those superstitious persons, 2 King. 17, 41. <HI>They served their graven Images, both their Children, and their Chil∣drens Children; as did their Fathers, so do they, to this day.</HI> If the Father follow superstitious or prophane practices, it is most likely that the Children will do so too; Therefore you that are Parents, in the sear of God look to it, that you do not scandalize your Children by an evil Example; If your Children see you in drink sometimes, will not they be drunkards too? If they hear you swear, will not they swear al∣so? if they see you careless in the observation of the Sabbath, will not they likewise be guilty of Sabbath∣breaking? And if they see you live in the neglect of holy duties, no prayer in the Family, how shall they be seekers of God? It will be a wonder if such Chil∣dren do not prove Athiests, that are brought up in Familyes, where they never see any prayer, or ac∣knowledgement of God. O think with your selves, if you that are Parents should any of you perish, and your miserable Children follow you to bell, how will they curse you there? If thy Children perish through thy evil Example, they will follow thee up and down in the ever burning Lake, crying out, <NOTE N="[f]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr.Bol∣ton of, walking with Go p.</HI> 249.</NOTE> Woe to us, that ever we were born of such Parents!
<PB N="22" REF="000274_0029_0FA45859BA2D8248"/>
that had no grace to teach us the wayes of God, and lead us in the paths of godliness; If you that were our Parents, had discharged your duty towards us, we might have been in the Joyes of Heaven, but now our damned Souls must live for ever in these everlasting flames; Thus wilt thou hear thine own Children yelling in thine Ears, world without end; Canst thou think of this, and thy heart not break? then thy heart is an Adamant, and thy heart strings made of Iron sinews.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>USE.</HI> 4.</NOTE> Of Exhortation,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let godly parents that are here before the Lord this day, suffer the word of Exhortation, <HI>Doe you endeavour to the utmost of your power, that your chil∣dren may become seekers and servants of the only true God in Jesus Christ.</HI> And indeed when you present them to the Lord in Baptism, you promise to doe your utmost, that they may become faithfull Ser∣vants of that God who is Father, Son and Spirit; take heed that you doe not become guilty of violating that Ingagement. God hath committed Children unto you, that so you might bring them up for him, <HI>The Children which thou hast borne unto me,</HI> Ezek. 16. 20. If a man had the children of a Prince or great man committed to his care and charge for educati∣on, would he not be carefull about that matter? It is a solemn thing, which it may be you have not duly considered, that the great God hath entrusted you with those that are his children, that so you may nurse them up for him: O then bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It is not enough for Parents to serve the Lord them∣selves, but they must use utmost endeavours that after they are dead, their children may walk in the wayes of God. And if they be duly, carefull in that matter, they have reason to expect, that God
<PB N="23" REF="000274_0030_0FA4585A6E1349C0"/>
will remember and establish his covenant with their Children. For it is noted concerning Abraham, that his care was that his Family <HI>after him</HI> (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> af∣ter he should cease to be in the world) might <HI>keep the way of the Lord,</HI> and so did the Lord bring upon him the thing which he had spoken, and graciously promised with respect to Abrahams posterity. And in special you that are mothers have a great advan∣tage put into your hands, to be instilling <NOTE N="[g]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr. Firmins real Chri∣stian. p.</HI> 8</NOTE> good principles into your childrens souls betimes; Solo∣mons mother taught him: we doe not read that Absaloms and Adonijahs mother taught them, as Bathsheba did her son Solomon. And it is not for no∣thing, that when children have proved thus or so, particular notice is taken in Scripture, that such or such were their mothers: Rehoboam did not prove well, and it is noted that his mother was an Ammo∣nitess. On the other hand, Hezekiah, Jehosha∣phar, Josiah were eminent Servants of God, and the Scripture doth mention who were their mothers. O then you that are mothers should endeavour that your Children (as <HI>Luther</HI> speaketh) may suck in Re∣ligion from their mothers breasts.</P>
<P>And let all godly parents <HI>earnestly seek unto the Lord for their poor children:</HI> You onght to doe so daily and particularly, and by name before the Lord and thus should you doe every day: as we read con∣cerning Job, that he offered burnt offerings for his Children, <HI>according to the number of them all, thus did Job continually.</HI> Job. 1. 5. Remember that you are under peculiar encouragement so to doe: if the Children of godly parents have special encourage∣ment to seek the Lord, then the same thing must needs be true concerning such parents themselves, with respect to their Children. And it is eminent∣ly true with respect to the children of <HI>New-England</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="000274_0031_0FA4585D021D4A50"/>
inasmuch as they are the posterity of such as have been sufferers on the account of the name and truth of the Lord Jesus. Are not such parents pronoun∣ced blessed twice over? Mat. 5. 11, 12. even bles∣sed in themselves, and in their posterity? Who knoweth but God may remember the kindness of the fathers in these Churches (who followed him into this wilderness whilst it was a land not sown) unto their children after them? Plead it with the Lord; if you that be godly parents lay up a stock of prayers for your children, it may stand them in more stead then if you should leave them never such an inheritance, as to the things of the world, when you are dead your prayers shall live. There is many a child whose father and mother is now in heaven, that fareth the better, and will doe so for ever, on the account of prayers made for him by his blessed parents while they were in this world. And this further let me say for your encouragement, that if the Lord stir up your hearts to be importunate with him, for your children, it is a sign that God intends mercy to them. That instance of <HI>Monica,</HI> Austins gracious mother is known and famous▪ when she made her complaint and wept to a faithfull Minister because her son did for the present follow ungodly courses and Compa∣nions; <NOTE N="[b]" PLACE="marg"><HI>vade a me (inquit) i∣tvivas. Fieri non potest filim istarum Lachri∣oerum pereas. August. onfess. L.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 12.</NOTE> <HI>Be of good comfort</HI> (said that holy man) <HI>for it cannot be that a Child of so many prayers and tears should perish.</HI></P>
<P>Say not, Oh! but I have prayed, and yet see no answer to my prayers! Well but con∣tinue seeking to the Lord still; despair not of a good answer at last. That famous Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Dedham,</HI> would sometimes say, <HI>If I see a child that hath either a Godly father or a godly mother, I shall have
<PB N="25" REF="000274_0032_0FA4585E9ABBCBB8"/>
hope for him a long time, but if he hath a godly Father and Mother too, He never leave hoping for him until I see him turned off the Gallows.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let me direct my Exhortation to the Children of Godly parents: There are many such that hear me this day: <HI>Be you exhorted to know and serve and seek the God of your Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>Consider therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Lord is your Fathers God.</HI> Know the God of thy Father, saith David. Prov. 27. 10. <HI>Forsake not thy Fathers friend.</HI> And wilt thou forsake thy fa∣thers God, who is the best friend that ever thy Fa∣ther had? Children are loth to part with other things because they were their Fathers; As Naboth said concerning his vineyard, <HI>God forbid that I should part with the inheritance of my Father.</HI> 1 King. 21. 3. The Lord was the inheritance of thy Father, and wilt thou let goe thy interest in him? Remember and consider that Scripture, Exod. 15. 2. <HI>The Lord is my Fathers God, and I will exalt him.</HI> So say thou, the Lord is my Fathers God, and therefore I will fear &amp; seek and serve him.</P>
<P>Consider. 2. <HI>The good &amp; benefit that will follow upon a sincere seeking to the Lord.</HI> If there were no∣thing more to be said, but only this, it should be a prevalling Motive, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That then your parents will have joy in you; A wise son (<HI>i. e.</HI> a godly son) ma∣keth a glad father. The Apostle John hath such an expression as this, <HI>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.</HI> 3. Joh. 4. Nor is there any greater joy to a godly Father, then to see truth of grace in his children; this comforts him more than to see that his Children are become rich or great in the world. Know also for your encouragement, that if you seek unto the Lord with your whole heart, He will be found of you: Yea, though your sins and pro∣vocations
<PB N="26" REF="000274_0033_0FA4585F277B25B0"/>
have been never so great: was there ever a greater Sinner then Menasseh, the son of blessed Hezekiah, <HI>Yet when he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, he was entreated of him.</HI> 2. Chro 33. 12, 13. O think of it, you that, though the chil∣dren of holy parents, have been hainous sinners be∣fore the Lord, seek him sincerely, and he will par∣don all your sins, and save your souls from eternal death. I remember I have read concerning the <NOTE N="[i]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Impe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Hist.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 223.</NOTE> Emperour <HI>otho</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> that having a son whose name was <HI>Luitolp,</HI> an haughty young man, that re∣belled against his Father, and for safety betook him∣self to the City of <HI>Mentz,</HI> which being beseiged by the Emperour, <HI>Luitolp</HI> fled to another place; and on a day when his father was in the field, his son unexpectedly came to him and kneeling before his father, humbly begged for pardon, with tears acknowledging his offences, and that he was worthy of a thousand deaths; but if it would please him to give him his life, he should ever be a loyal and obe∣dient son for the time to come: presently his Fa∣thers bowels verned over him, and he restored that prodigal son to his former place and dignityes, who ever after approved himself as became a loyal Subject and dutifull Son. How much more will the blessed God pardon you, and accept you into his favour, all your Rebellions notwithstanding, if in∣deed you humbly and sincerely seek unto him? Yea and God will bless you when your Parents shall be taken from you; he will then be a father to you. Psal. 27. 10. <HI>When my Father and my mother forsake me, the Lord will take me up,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> as a tender hearted fa∣ther taketh up his child into his arms, and beareth him in his bosome. It is therefore said concerning the just man, that <HI>his Children are blessed after him.</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="000274_0034_0FA458619271B5D0"/>
Prov. 20. 7. And Jacob told his Sons that though he died, God would be with them, Gen. 48. 21. It is also noted concerning Isaac, that <HI>God blessed him af∣ter the death of his Father Abraham.</HI> Gen. 25. 11. Not but that the Lord blessed him before that, only after his Fathers death, the blessing of the Lord was upon him more then ever.</P>
<P>Consider, 3. <HI>The evil that is in your not seeking the Lord.</HI> What a grief of mind will this be to your godly Parents? The Father of a fool hath no joy. Alas! there is many a poor parent may say to their Children, as Jephtah upon another account spake to his daughter, Judg. 11. 35. <HI>He rent his cloathes, and said, alas my daughter, thou hast brought me very low, thou art one of them that trouble me.</HI> Why should you bring your Parents down with sorrow to their graves? How did it go to the heart of David, when Absolom dyed, and was cut off in his sins? 2 Sam. 18. 33. <HI>He was much moved, and as he went, thus he said, O my Son Absolom, my Son, my Son Absolom, would God I had dyed for thee, O Absolom, my Son, my Son.</HI> As if he had said, had I dyed, my Soul had been happy, but now thou art dead, I have no other hope but that thy Soul is suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Remember that this will aggravate your sin, and condemnation, that you were born of godly Parents, and did not walk in their steps, Jer. 50. 7. <HI>They sinned against the hope of their Fathers;</HI> it is men∣tioned as the great aggravation of their sin. Such Children roll reproach upon the Covenant of God; they cause men to say, there is nothing in being in Covenant with God, nor is it any mercy to be born of Parents that fear the Lord; 'And will not the Lord judge you for causing such a vile reproach to be cast upon his holy Covenant? you will be most inexcu∣sable before the Lord another day; If a righteous

man beget a Son that becometh a Robber, or an A∣dulterer, shall he live? he shall not live, but dye, and his blood shall be upon him, Ezek. 18. 10, 13. The blood of thy Soul shall be upon thy own head; All the instructions, Exhortations, Admonitions, Prayers, Examples of thy godly Parents, will be brought in as so many witnesses for thy condemna∣tion at the last day; yea, the tears of thy blessed Pa∣rents will be as oyl to make the everlasting flames of hell burn the more vehemently upon thy Soul, throughout the dayes of Eternity; <HI>The Lord will cast thee off for ever;</HI> Thy Father that begat thee, thy Mother that bare thee, will not pitty thee when thou shalt be sentenced to eternal Death at the last day. Remember Dives; In hell he lift up his eyes being in Torments, and cryed, Father Abraham! have mercy on me; but all the mercy his Father Abraham would shew to him, was, he! said, <HI>Son, remem∣ber that in thy life time thou hadst thy good things;</HI> As if he had said, nay, thou art justly dealt with. So will thy Parents say to thee, Remember that in thy life time we instructed thee, and thou hadst good coun∣sel given to thee many a time, but thou wouldest not regard it. Oh consider of it! yea know, that if thou dyest in thy sins, thy godly Parents will stand forth, &amp; testifie against thee, before the Lord Jesus, at the last day; As that blessed man Mr. <HI>Bolton,</HI> would sometimes solemnly profess to his Children, <NOTE N="[k]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr. Bol∣tons life.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Chil∣dren, let any of you meet me at the day of Judgement, in an unregenerate Christless estate if you dare, I will then testify against you before the Lord.</HI> Yea, thy gracious Parents will joyn with the Lord Jesus, in passing a Sentence of Eternal Condemnation upon thee; We read in the book of Revelation, how the Saints say, Hallelujah, our God hath Judged the great whore, Righteous are his Judgements, and when the finoke

of her Torment rose up for ever and ever, they wor∣shipped God, and said, <HI>Amen, Hallelujah;</HI> Even so, when the Son of God shall say to thee, depart thou cursed wretch into Everlasting Fire, thy Father will say, <HI>Amen, Lord Jesus!</HI> This is the Son, this is the daughter, that I so often instructed and warned, and told them if they did not repent of sin, and get an interest in Christ, they should certainly perish for ever, but they would not hear, therefore let thy Ju∣stice be glorified for ever in their eternal confusion. O what an heart hast thou, if this break it not? Ne∣vertheless,</P>
<P>Consider, 4. <HI>There are many Children of godly Pa∣rents to be seen, that do not seek the Lord God of their Fathers.</HI> Yea, how many such are there in <HI>New∣England,</HI> that are not of their Fathers principles? If a Temptation should come it is to be feared, that the greatest part of this Generation would comply, and disown that cause which their Fathers suffered for. How many that are not of their Fathers Spirit; not heavenly minded, but pursuing worldly Interests with their whose hearts; Nor zealous for God, and his glory, but lukewarm, and wofully indifferent in the matters of Religion; Nor in practice and con∣versation like their Fathers; Not of an holy gift conversation, but loose and vain, &amp; vile and vitious; Swearers, Gamesters, given to rioting and drunken∣ness, Chambering and wantonness! Nay, how ma∣ny are there before the Lord in this Congregation, that never sought the God of their Fathers, even to this day? Some that never prayed in their lives, or never in earnest; You Children, it may be you say a prayer, a few words that you have been used to, but are you in earnest? do you cry to God as for your lives? do you take the Kingdome of Heaven by violence? O but few such!</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="000274_0037_0FA4592AB2D9F5A8"/>Consider, 5. <HI>You know not how soon your finding time may be past and gone,</HI> therefore now seek the Lord; up and be doing, lest thy Sun go down at Noon, and God make the day dark over thy Soul. Dost not thou know that the Lord useth to make quick work with the Children of his Servants, when they will not seek him, albeit they have been brought up un∣der the solemn warnings of God? It may be he will give thee up to a reprobate sense, and his Spirit for ever cease striving with thee; then woe woe be to thee, saith the Lord. Remember how it was of old: when the Sons of God, (even the posterity of godly Seth) the posterity of eminent professors of Religi∣on, did degenerate, <HI>God said his Spirit shall strive no longer with them,</HI> Gen. 6. 3. <HI>my Spirit shall not alwayes strive.</HI> Or death may come upon you; How many young men that have fallen down slain of late? The Sword is raging, and how are they that are of <HI>the ri∣sing Generation numbred for the Sword?</HI> Deadly Arrows are flying over your heads, yea, death is climbing in at windows, and carrying away young men apace; now if death overtake thee before thy Soul be got into the City of refuge, it had been good for thee never to have been born; It will be too late to seek the Lord then; If thou shouldest then seek him early, thou canst not find him; When once the gates of death are shut upon thee, and thou locked fast under the bars of the pit; When once thy Soul is out of thy body, in a moment it shooteth the Gulf of Eternity, and then though thou shouldest seek and cry till Heaven and Earth shakes, and pray, and weep Seas of tears of blood, all will be in vain. O thy Sonl, thy Soul mustly weltring in a fiery Ocean, as long as the Eternal God shall have any Being! Can thy heart endure to think of this? No! O then seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="000274_0038_0FA4592C9D5E8A18"/>
Something let me speak by way of Direction▪ briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be thank full to the Lord in that he hath given you to be born of godly parents:</HI> in that you have been (as David speaketh) cast upon the Lord from the womb And he hath been your God from your mothers bel∣ly. Psal. 22. 10. You might have been born of such Parents as would have nursed you up in ignorance, profaness or idolatry, and so your souls have been under a necessity of perishing for ever, but the Lord hath given you to be of parents that have designed you for God, and for his glory. Yea it was for your sakes especially that your Fathers ventured their lives upon the rude waves of the vast Ocean. Was it not with respect unto posterity, that our Fathers came into this wilderness? that they might train up a generation for Christ: Bless God that ever you had such Fathers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Plead the Lords g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acious Covenant with him,</HI> he is ve∣ry willing that you should doe so: <HI>Ask me concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</HI> Isa. 45. 11. You say you cannot give grace to your own Souls. True! But hath not the Lord in the Co∣venant of grace said, <HI>I will give you a new heart.</HI> Ezek. 36. 26. Plead that Promise, you especially that have had the Covenant sealed to you; why should you let your Baptism lye by you, as if it were of no use? Go to God in secret, and say, Lord thou hast promised to give a new heart to the children of thy Servants, &amp; thy Covenant hath been sealed to me in my Bap∣tism; Oh give me a new heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Doe not rest in any thing that is external:</HI> Not in your relation to godly parents, &amp; visible relation to God on that account; it is not you parents seeking unto God will save you, except you seek him your selves also. Did not the Lord say to the children of Israel, <HI>Are ye not as the children of AEthiopians un∣to me?</HI> Amos. 9. 7.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="000274_0039_0FA4592E4939DCB8"/>They vainly trusted, that no destruction should ever come upon them, because they were descended from blessed Ancestors. You may be as far from eternal salva∣tion as the Children of Ethiopians for all that, if you do not serve the God of your Fathers. Therefore John Bap∣tist said, <HI>Think not to say, we have Abraham for our Father, Math.</HI> 3. 9. I have known some that have been so foolish as to think they should be saved, only because they were the Children of godly Parents, though they lived in the neglect of God, &amp; of their own Souls. Beware of so per∣verting the Truth delivered unto you. And rest not in being outwardly civil and blameless; was not Paul so before his Conversion, Phil. 3. 6. And they that have been advantaged with a religious Education, often times are so, though never truly converted. Beware also of taking up a form of godliness without the power of it. O you that are the Children of godly Parents, if you outwardly observe the Sabbath day, and pray in secret, and read the Scriptures, (all which things I charge you in the Name of the Lord, that you attend unto them whilst you live) you will be apt to rest here, without an interest in the glorious Righteousness of the Son of God, but for the love of your immortal Souls, I beseech you, deceive not your selves; build not upon a false foundation, look to it, in the fear of God, that your hearts be perfect before him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Never leave seeking God until you find him:</HI> Seek, and Seek, and Seek again, untill you know that you have ob∣tained a saving interest in Jesus Christ, and in the favor of God through him. O make thorough work of it in the matter of your Conversion; be not almost but alto∣gether Christians; so shall you find that the blessing of all the Prayers, and Covenant of your gracious Parents will come upon you for evermore.</P>

<P><HI>THe Title-Page prefixed to this Discourse, inti∣mateth the Time and Occasion of its delivery. I had no cause to (nor did I) expect, that it would fall to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to speak before the choice was made; If I had, I would have used means to prevent that trouble from coming upon my self or others. But it may be, God did it to prove me and see whether I would please men or Christ. And I hope I may (in some measure) say after the Apostle,</HI> We are bold in our God to speak. Our Exhortation was not of deceit, but even so we speak not as pleasing men but God, which tryeth our hearts. For neither at any time used we flattering words, nor of men sought we glory. <HI>That great Reformer in</HI> Scotland, <HI>when upon his Death-bed, could say with comfort,</HI> That I did forbear none of what condition soever, I did it out of the fear of my God, who hath placed me in the function of his Ministry, and I know will bring me to an account. <HI>even so I must confess, the awfull sense of the great opportunity which the Lord put into my hands to discharge my Consci∣science, in being witness to his Name and Truth, &amp; of the account which I certainly know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give to him, caused me to speak as I did; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more controversal Dis∣courses.

It can not be, but the Lord will be provoked by such things; especially in</HI> New-England, <HI>where men are not under such Temptations to forsake their assembling themselves together, as in some other places: and where zeal on the other hand hath been notorious, so that such</HI> Lukewarm∣ness <HI>will in a people, circumstanced as we are, be an e∣vidence of</HI> Apostacy.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 Chron. 28. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>But if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS there is a peculiar Excellency in all the Books of Scripture, becoming the Majesty of their Author; so it is in spe∣cial maner true with respect unto this sacred Book of <HI>Chronicles;</HI> which is <NOTE N="[a]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> English Dutch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI></NOTE> not the same with those Chroni∣cles we sometimes read of in the <HI>Kings,</HI> those being civil <HI>Records,</HI> but these wholly of a divine Inspiration, containing the History of no less then three thousand &amp; five hundred years; even from the first man Adam unto the Jews Return from the Babylonish Captivi∣ &amp; many years after that also. The Hebrews suppose it, (or at least some part of it) to be the last Book of Scripture that was written, and therefore they are wont to place it last in their Bibles, as the concluding Book of the old-Testament. The Greeks entitle it, [<HI>ton paraleipomenon Biblion,</HI>] Because divers things most worthy of eternal Commemoration, are rela∣ted in these Books which are no where else to be found. So in this Chapter, we have Davids solemn dying Exhortation. Words which deserve to be re∣corded, and yet are no where else seen (at least wise not in that ample manner) but in this Chapter, And it was in a very solemn Assembly that these words were spoken; Indeed in a <HI>general Assembly,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n all the Lords people, both as to civil and Ec∣clesiastical order were come together, for the esta∣blishment
<PB N="38" REF="000274_0044_0FA459325825BB70"/>
of another Ruler amongst them, accor∣dingly David doth here direct his Exhortation, first to the Representatives of the People, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>And David assembled all the Prinoes of Israel, the Princes of the Tribes, and the Captains of the Companies unto themselves, &amp;c.</HI> Hence they are said to be all Israel, ver. 8. <HI>In the sight of all Israel,</HI> h. e. the Heads and Representatives of all Israel, and therefore are said to be <HI>the Congregation of the Lord.</HI> Often in the Scripture by <HI>the Congregation,</HI> the Heads and Rulers of the Congregation are meant. Now the Exhor∣tation unto them is, that they would <HI>keep and seek all the Commandments of the Lord,</HI> h. e. that they would observe what they did know, and seek to know more of the mind of God. The motive whereby he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgeth this, is, because the Lord had promised the good Land to them; but it was upon that condition of their keeping his Commandments, therefore it did highly concern them, to be careful about that matter. <HI>2dly,</HI> he directs his Exhortation to him that was to be established as chief Ruler, soil. to his Son Solomon, whom God appointed to succeed his Fa∣ther in the Government. Now sincerity was the main thing which David his Father did exhort him unto, in the beginning of this Verse. <HI>And thou So∣lomon my Son know thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind.</HI> This is further urged from three motives, 1. From the consideration of the divine Omnisciency. <HI>For the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the ima∣ginations of the thoughts. 2dly,</HI> From the benefit and good, which would follow upon seeking to the Lord. <HI>If thou seek him he will be found of thee.</HI> 3. From the evil that is in forsaking him; In the words now be∣fore us; which though they were spoken to Solo∣mon, yet were they of equal concernment unto
<PB N="39" REF="000274_0045_0FA45932DC00F9D0"/>
others being Circumstanced as he was, <HI>h. e.</HI> that were of the younger, Rising, succeeding Generati∣on, being also the Children and posterity of godly Parents. Especially, the words did and do concern those that are the <HI>Posterity</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> that is to say, of such as have been eminent Servants of God in their Generation. The Doctrine which I would therefore (by the help of Christ) insist on, as con∣ceiving that it may not be altogether unsuitable for this great Audience, is this.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctr.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>That if they that are the Children and Posterity of Gods eminent Servants shall forsake the Lord, he will cast them off for ever.</HI> In the doctrinal handling of this Truth, there are four things which may be briefly enquired into. 1. When men especially the Children of Gods Servants, may be said to forsake him? 2. What is implyed, in this casting off for ever? 3. What for∣saking of God that is, which will be attended, with such casting off. 4. The Reason of this dread∣ful procedure of the most High towards the Posteri∣ty of his People.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>When may men be said to forsake the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>When they depart from the blessed Truths of God, then may they be said to forsake him.</HI> Hence the Apostle chargeth it upon the Apos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tizing Gala∣tians, that they were <HI>removed from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that called them,</HI> Gal. 1. 6. <HI>h. e.</HI> they had forsaken God himself, because they had corrupted and forsaken the great Truths of the Gospel. All Truth is from God, there∣fore he is styled, <HI>the God of Truth,</HI> Deut. 32. 4. Yea, Truth it self, 1 Joh. 5, 6. And Truth is said to be his <HI>Name,</HI> Christ said to his faithful ones in the Church of Pargamus, <HI>thou holdest fast my Name,</HI> Rev. 2. 13. The Truths of Christ were much opposed by the In∣fidels, and by the Hereticks of those dayes, only some did faithfully adhere thereunto; and these are said to
<PB N="40" REF="000274_0046_0FA45934707958F8"/>
hold fast his Name. So then to forsake the Truth is to forsake the Lords Name. Especially when there is Apostacy from great-Foundation. Truths in Religion, the Lord is forsaken. Albeit every Truth hath the Name of God stamped upon it, yet there are some Truths which have more of his Name on them, then others have, that the disowning of them is absolutely to reject the Lord, namely fundamen∣tal Truths, which indeed are not many nor hard to be known. Moreover, when those Truths are dis∣owned by Children, which their Fathers were emi∣nently engaged in the profession of, (though they should not be fundamental in their natures) such Children may be said to forsake the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When men deify any other Object besides the Lord;</HI> They that set up other things in Gods stead, in their so doing forsake the Lord, so it is when men give religious worship to any other besides him, who a∣lone ought to be feared, Thus the Children of Isra∣el because they did worship <HI>Baal and Ashtaroth,</HI> h. e. the <NOTE N="[b]" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> (for those were the first Creatures that the Gentiles Idolized, and the Syrians called the Sun, Baal; and the Moon Ashta∣roth) they are therefore charged with forsaking God, Judg. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 13. Idolatry is the greatest Apo∣stacy in the world. Such are by way of eminency styled <HI>forsakers of God,</HI> Deut. 32. 15. <HI>He forsook God,</HI> meaning that they did Apostatize to Idolatry, there∣fore in <HI>ver.</HI> 16. it is added that <HI>they provoked him to Jealous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with their strange Gods,</HI> that is to say, with new Gods or Idols, for new things are strange, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. <HI>They sacrificed to new Gods which came newly up, whom their Fathers feared not.</HI> And this is true not only with respect unto that more gross Idolatry, when men shall avow the Service of Idols, but also concerning secret, spiritual, heart Idolatry, even
<PB REF="000274_0047_0FA45934AFB4CC90"/>
worldliness, <HI>Math</HI> 6. 24. Ye <HI>cannot serve both God and Mammon.</HI> The Servants of Mammon, <HI>h. e.</HI> of the world, are forsakers of God, when men pour out the strength of their affections upon worldly Ob∣jects, or place their chief delight and confidence in these things, it argueth an heart departure from the Lord, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 5. If Fathers have sought Christ, and the things of Christ in the first place, and their Chil∣dren shall come after them, and espouse a worldly Interest, it is a woful God-forsaking.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is a forsaking God, in respect of his holy In∣stitutions.</HI> Hence a people that are without Ordi∣nances, are said to be without God, 2 Chron. 15. 3. it is there mentioned, that <HI>Israel had for a long season been without the true God,</HI> because they had been without the Ministry, and without Ordinances. If these be not duly observed the Lord is forsaken, <HI>Isai.</HI> 65. 11. <HI>But ye are they that forsake the Lord, and forget my holy Mountain,</HI> so that to forget the holy Mountain, <HI>h. e.</HI> the neglect of divine worship and Ordinances, is a forsaking of the Lord. Look as when the Lord doth deprive a people of his Ordi∣nances, he is said to forsake them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23. 33. <HI>I will even forsake you saith the Lord;</HI> the meaning is (saith <HI>Calvin</HI>) you shall no more have Ministry and Ordi∣ances, amongst you, so when they are willing to be deprived thereof, they may be said to forsake him, Judg. 10. 6. <HI>they forsook the Lord, and served him not.</HI> Not to regard the service of God is to forsake him. For in Ordinances we have to doe with God, Hebr. 4. 13. in hearing the word, in Prayer, in Sab∣baths, in Sacraments, we have to doe with God. Or if the holy Ordinances be corrupted, then the Lord is forsaken. And so it is when men will be adding their inventions to Gods institutions, Psal. 106. 39. <HI>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went
<PB N="42" REF="000274_0048_0FA4593731DD3688"/>
a whoring with their own inventions.</HI> When men fol∣low their own inventions they goe a whoring from the Lord, of this nature were the high Places of old 2 Chron. 33. 17. <HI>The People did sacrifice in the high places, yet to the Lord their God only.</HI> Those high Places were lawfull to worship God in, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Engl. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 6.</NOTE> until the Temple was built, but after that it was a breach of the second Commandment to place any Religion in them, and therefore in some degree a departure from the Lord. If Fathers have prized Ordinances above the world, and endeavoured to uphold them in their power and purity, but their Children after them shall not regard whether they enjoy the Or∣dinances of Christ or no, or if they doe, shall not be carefull and studious to keep them pure, accor∣ding to Scripture Rule, they fall under this dread∣full charge of Apostacy from God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There is a forsaking of God in respect of Conver∣sation.</HI> There are that by works doe deny God, Tit. 1. 16. An holy heavenly Conversation is expressed in the Scripture, by that of <HI>walking with God.</HI> Gen. 5. 24. &amp; 6. 9. Therefore an evill conversation is a de∣parture <HI>from God.</HI> It is called a forsaking the Law of the Lord, Jer. 9. 13. By a corrupt conversation men deviate from the Law, and are such Apostates as the Text speaketh of. In this respect those wick∣ed men, whose foundation was destroyed with the flood, (as Eliphaz speaketh) even the sinners of the old world were Apostates from God. We doe not read of (nor doe I believe that there was) any Ido∣latry in the old world, but they were over run with Atheism, Pride, Sensuality, Vncleaness, Oppressi∣on, and the like scandalous Enormityes. And the Apostacy of the Children of Israel, did consist partly in this, as we see in that wofull instance of the Ben∣jamites, the greatest part of whom the Lord cast off
<PB N="43" REF="000274_0049_0FA45938EE1EF220"/>
for ever. Yea and the Antichristian Apostacy pre∣dicted in the New Testament, doth consist partly in this: We know that the Anti-Christian Generation (Papists I mean) are generally not only (as all of them are) horribly superstitious and idolatrous, but of most profane and debauched Consciences and con∣versations; in the Book of the Revelations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their murthers, Sorceryes, Fornications, Thefts, Rev. 9. 21. If then the Children of the Covenant shall not walk worthy of God, but in the wayes of Pride, Sensuality, Vnrighteousness; If when Fa∣thers have been of an holy, exempla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> conversation their Children shall be unholy and profane, they are forsakers of God, concerning whom he hath threat∣ned, to cast them off for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>When the fear of God is wanting in the hearts of such as are above others bound to fear and serve him, they are forsakers of the Lord</HI> For there is an inward heart departure from God, as well as that which is outward and visible: So it is when there is no faith nor fear of God in the heart, Hebr. 3. 12. <HI>Take heed lest there be in any of you an evill heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</HI> Infidelity in the heart is the root of all Apostacy. If the Children of godly Parents shall not endeavour truly to fear and serve the Lord God of their Fathers, they are such as do forsake him, yea and such as he will cast off for ever. And therefore in this Context David did intimate unto his Son Solomon, that if he did not serve the Lord even with a perfect heart, he should be cast off for ever.</P>
<P>We proceed therefore to the second Question <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is implyed in this casting off for ever?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>It implyeth a change as to divine Dispensa∣tions.</HI> In the Scripture, when the Lord threatned to cast off his people, that is intended, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that he
<PB N="44" REF="000274_0050_0FA4593A354A49C8"/>
would make an alteration as to the tenor of his dis∣pensations towards them: here it is set in oppositi∣on to <HI>finding God,</HI> If thou seek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off: Now finding God doth imply the enjoyment of his favour, and therefore in <HI>Casting off</HI> is implyed the deprivement of the Lords favourable presence. It is indeed most true, that the special favour of God is unchangeable, Rom. 5. 2. <HI>This Grace wherein we stand.</HI> He that hath once access into the special grace and favour of God stands and abideth therein for ever, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respect of that there is no casting off for ever; In the Covenant of grace the Lord hath pro∣mised saying, <HI>I will not cast off the Seed of Israel for all that they have done,</HI> Jer. 31. 37. But then there is com∣mon favour, in respect of outward blessings, which are the effects of common love, &amp; that may utterly cease, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9. 15. <HI>I will love them no more.</HI> I have loved them, (saith the Lord) <HI>h. e.</HI> bestowed outward mer∣cyes on them, but I will do so no more. They shall have no more such dayes of peace, no more such plenty, no more such means of grace as once they did enjoy. Thus of a friend the Lord may turn to be an Enemy, Isai. 63. 10. <HI>But they rebelled and vex∣ed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, and he fought against them.</HI> Whilst a Cove∣nant people, carry it so as not to break Covenant, the Lord blesseth them visibly, but if they degenerate then blessings are removed, and woful Judgements come in their room, &amp; that's implyed in this casting off which the Text speaketh of, <HI>soil,</HI> that mercyes shall be taken away, as it was said of Saul that when God cast him off he took away his mercy from him, 1 Chron, 17, 13. because he was deprived of that great outward blessing and dignity which once he did enjoy, And the sending of contrary miseryes to
<PB N="45" REF="000274_0051_0FA4593AB2D2E8F8"/>
those mercyes; that instead of peace there shall be Wars, instead of plenty poverty, instead of health terrible sicknesses, instead of planting, plucking up and destroying, these things are implyed in this casting off, thus Psal. 89. 38. <HI>But Thou hast cast off and abhorred; thou hast been wroth with thine anotnted.</HI> I conceive the Psalmist in those words hath <NOTE N="[c]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Foor in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> respect to the sad change of Providence which befel the Lords People in Rehoboams time, for the Psalm was written by <HI>Ethan,</HI> who was contemporary with Solomen, and probably lived to see the woful chan∣ges which hapned five years after Solomons death, when the Land was invaded and sorely wasted by Heathen Enemies, and some (though not all) of the wrath of God poured out upon his people, and up∣on the Apostatized Children of David, strong holds were brought to ruine, and they did not stand in the day of Battel as in former times they had done, now these temporal Judgements are called <HI>a casting off.</HI> 2. <HI>It doth imply a discovenanting and unchurch∣ing.</HI> If the Children of godly Fathers shall forsake the Lord he will cast them off, <HI>h. e.</HI> it will at last come to this that the Lord will disown them; and excommunicate them, and say they are none of his, for although there is no falling from a state of saving grace, yet they that have only a visible interest in God may fall from that Estate, <HI>what they have shall be taken from them.</HI> They that are internally and sin∣cerely in Covenant with God shall never lose their interest in the Covenant, for they <HI>betrothed unto the Lord for ever, Hos.</HI> 2. 19. But they that are ex∣ternally in Covenant, may cease to be the Lords vi∣sible people; Thus it came to pass concerning the ten Tribes. Hence the Lord speaketh, as Jer. 3. 8. <HI>Back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liding Israel committed Adultery, and I had put her away and given her a Bill of divorce,</HI> so that the
<PB N="46" REF="000274_0052_0FA4593B7A88E8B8"/>
marriage Covenant, which was between the Lord &amp; them was dissolved, this is confirmed by the Pro∣phet Hosea, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. 2. where the Lord saith <HI>plead with your mother, plead for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband,</HI> so in <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 9. <HI>Call his Name Lo-Ammi, for they are not my people, and I will not be your God,</HI> therefore also the Lord by the Prophet Ezekiel calls the ten Tribes by the name of <HI>Aboldh.</HI> The two Tribes the Jews, were then called by the name of <HI>Abolibah,</HI> which signifieth <HI>my Tent,</HI> because as yet God had not rejected them. But the ten Tribes are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Abolah,</HI> which signifieth <HI>a Tent,</HI> as if the Lord had said they are none of mine, now I have done with them and utterly rejected them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 23. 4. After wards the Jews also were discore∣nanted and unchurched. The Prophet Zachariah had foretold that upon their unbelief, in rejecting Jesus Christ the only true Messias, it should be so <HI>I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my Covenant which I made with all the People,</HI> Zach. 11. 10. And Paul tels us that sad Prediction was fulfilled, therefore Rom. 11. 12. he speaketh of <HI>The Fall</HI> of the Jews, meaning that they were fallen from their visible Church estate to be in the same condition which the Gentile world was in before the coming of Christ, so that they were fallen from hea∣ven to earth; and in <HI>v.</HI> 20, 22. he speaketh of their being <HI>broken off</HI> and <HI>cut off,</HI> h. e. cut off from the vi∣sible Church. The Apostle <NOTE N="[d]" PLACE="marg"><HI>v.

Now the natural branches were broken off: and therefore in the New Testament they are declared to be none of the Lords people, Rev: 3. 9.
<PB N="47" REF="000274_0053_0FA4593C2EB2C1F8"/>
<HI>They call themselves Jews, but are not so, but are of the Synagogue of Satan.</HI> They say they are Jews, h. e. they boast of their being the Lords People, but in truth they are not so (saith Christ) they glory in the name of a <HI>Synagogue,</HI> but now they are not Gods Synagogue, but Satans. And in these dayes of the New-Testament the Lord hath disowned, &amp; un-Churched these and those hat once were his People, Rev. 2. 5. <HI>I will remove the Candle∣stick out of his place.</HI> That Threatning is not only ful∣filled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ephesus, but on all the Churches in Asia; there have been in former Ages bright and glorious Candlesticks in that part of the world, but they are long since all broken to pieces. The Romish Anti∣christian Idolatry, hath prevailed so far amongst Christians for above these thousand years, that they that are overrun there with, Christ doth declare them to be looked upon, as Gentiles, as Heathens, and that they are not to be looked upon as within the Temple, or as indeed appertaining to the visible Church, Rev. 11. 2. And this disowning and un∣churching a people is called a <HI>Casting them off.</HI> 3. The expression here doth imply <HI>everlasting rejection in the other world.</HI> The Hebrew Phrase <HI>[jazni chaka lagnad] Arias Montanus</HI> translateth <HI>execrabitur te in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternum.</HI> if thou forsake him, he will make thee an eternal execration. Though it be a deep truth, that the line of election <NOTE N="[†]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> precedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sermon P.</HI> 29.</NOTE> doth for the most part run through the loins of godly parents, yet not only so, for men may be descended from godly Parents and Progenitors, and yet be the subjects of eternal Re∣probation and Damnation. Math. 8. 12. <HI>The Chil∣dren of the Kingdome shall be cast out into outer darkness.</HI> We read of one that could call <HI>Abraham</HI> his <HI>Father,</HI> and unto whom Abraham said <HI>Son</HI> remember that in thy life time thou hadst thy good things, that ne∣vertheless

when he dyed, went to <HI>the place of Tor∣ment.</HI> If such Children forsake the Lord, it is not the prayers nor tears of godly Fathers that will save them; Nay, these will be an infinite aggravation of their misery. The tears of a godly Father, if his Children forsake the Lord, will make the flames of Eternal Fire burn the more fiercely upon their Souls for ever. Therefore well might David say to his Son Solomon, <HI>If thou forsake the Lord, he will cast thee off for ever.</HI></P>
<P>We come in the next place to enquire, <HI>what for∣saking of God that is, that will be attended with this ca∣sting off?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. In two words, 1. <HI>this must be understood concerning deep departures from God,</HI> and from his blessed wayes, Hos. 9. 9. <HI>They have deeply corrupted themselves therefore he will visit their sins.</HI> The Lord is the God of patience, and of all grace, and thence is very slow in rejecting utterly a people, (of such Posterity) whom he hath once taken into Covenant with himself. Hence it is not lesser departures, but high and great offences against the Lord, that Pro∣vokes him to cast off his People, <HI>e. g. Idolatry</HI> is a sin that causeth the rejection which the Text speaks of▪ Yea, it is true with reference unto that Idolatry which is against the second Commandment. When the Children of Israel committed that Idolatry re∣specting the Calf in the Wilderness, they sinned a∣gainst the second Commandment, for they would worship the Lord still, only they would do it in such a way, and by such means as God never appointed, and they were in great da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger of being cast off for this sin. Hence the Lord said to Moses, <HI>thy People have corrupted themselves,</HI> Exod. 32. 7. The Lord doth not say <HI>my People,</HI> as he was wont to do, but <HI>Thy</HI> Peo∣ple, as if it were said; Now they have violated my
<PB N="49" REF="000274_0055_0FA4593DAD729138"/>
Covenant, and deserve that I should for ever disown and reject them. The Asian Churches have been cast off for this sin especially; we may read the sin of those Churches written in dreadful Characters, upon the Forehead of that Judgement which hath destroyed them all. God hath let loose the barba∣rous Turks upon them, who hate and destroy no men so much as those that worship Images. And as for the Church of Rome, the Apostle Paul did so∣lemnly predict that they should be cast off, Rom. 11. 22. Now it is for this sin principally that the Lord hath cast them off. Again, Heresy causeth this ca∣sting off which the Text speaketh of, Societies con∣sisting of such as disown the fundamental Truths of the Gospel, the Lord Jesus disowns them. Hence the Jews are disowned and rejected by the Lord, for although they own some fundamental Truths in Religion, indeed all <NOTE N="[e]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Jac. Cappellu in Heb.</HI> 6. 1.</NOTE> those six principles mentio∣ned by the Apostle to the Hebrews, (<HI>Cap</HI> 6. 1, 2.) the Jews acknowledge, yet there are other founda∣tion Truths, which they reject; That Jesus of Naza∣reth is the true Messiah, that Messiah is God as well as man, the Doctrine of original sin, and of salvati∣on by imputed righteousness, all which things are necessary to be believed in order to eternal life, this do they reject and disown; and therefore the Lord hath cast them off. when a People shall be so far de∣generate as to loose the Essentials of Religion, they are the Lords no longer. Heretical Assemblies may be the Flocks of those that pretend to be Christs companions, but they are none of Christs Flocks, Can. 1. 7. So for scandalous miscarriages in life &amp; con∣versation, these provoke the Lord to cast off a pro∣fessing People. In a building, if once the <HI>materials</HI> be rotted &amp; corrupted, the house will moulder away, the matter being an Essential Cause. And in Church
<PB N="50" REF="000274_0056_0FA4593EDA024788"/>
building we know that Saints <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the material cause; and therefore scandal in life do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> destroy the Essen∣tials of a Church, and so brings along with it this casting off which the Text speaks of. 2. <HI>It is an Im∣peritent, incorrigible forsaking God,</HI> that doth cause him to cast off a people or person. Solomon was guilty (notwithstanding the solemn dying charge of his Father to the contrary) of dreadful forsakings and Apostasies from the Lord, but he repented of them, as we she by the book of <HI>Ecclesiates,</HI> and therefore the Lord did not wholly cast him off for ever Notwithstanding great degeneracy in a Peo∣ple, the Lord is not wont to cast them off until he hath used all means for their Recovery, so it was with the Children of Israel of old, 2 Chron. 36. 15. The Scripture hath recorded the names of above twenty Prophets which the Lord sent to his People of old to tell them of their backslidings, and call up∣on them to repent and reform, before he would cast them off. And though in these dayes of the New∣Testament, because men sin against greater light and grace, then in former times, the Lord Jesus ma∣keth quicker work, with an Apostatizing People, then in the dayes of old, and in the years of ancient Generations; and therefore he said to the Church in Ephes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>except thou consider whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works, I will come against thee quickly, and remove the Candlestick out of his place;</HI> nevertheless, he useth means to reduce and recover a backsliding People, before he casts them off, so he did with the Asian Churches, and so hath he done with the Anti-Christian Generation, and therefore raised up great Instruments, who have preached the Everlasting Gospel with a loud voice, and called for Reformation; and might therefore say <NOTE N="[f]" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parke∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, de polit Eccles. <HI>&amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainold de dol.

healed, therefore her Judgement reacheth unto Heaven' and is lifted up even to the Skies.</HI> The Lord doth give a first and second admonition before he doth reject; He tryeth what his Word will do, what lesser and greater Judgements will do, yea; and what mer∣cies and deliverances will do, and if nothing will prevail, then he casts off for-ever. If a Generation be Apostate, and Incorrigibly Apostate, it will not belong before God doth cast them off for-ever, Jer. 15. 6, 7. <HI>Thou hast forsaken me saith the Lord, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gone backward, therefore will I stretch out my hand a∣gainst thee, I will destroy my People sith they return not from their wayes.</HI> In a word, when Apostacy is total and final then the Lord doth reject men, yea, though the Children and Posterity of his own Servants, he casts them off for-ever.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But why so?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> For such <HI>Reasons</HI> as these.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because the Transgressions of such Chil∣dren as the Doctrine speaks of are peculiar provoca∣tions; if the Children of David sin their iniquity is attended with special aggravations. They sin a∣gainst greater light, and love, and grace, then may be said of any persons in the world besides; They this rebel against the Light do at last provoke the Lord utterly to reject them. Hence it is that re∣fusing Instruction, is mentioned as the grand pro∣curing cause of this Rejection, Jer. 6. 8. <HI>Be instructed O Jerusalem lest my Soul depart from thee, &amp; thou become desolate.</HI> Now thus it is when the Children of God∣ly Parents forsake the Lord, as Solomon doth ac∣knowledge, how diligent and faithful his blessed Fa∣ther had been in instrncting of him, Prov. 4. 3, 4. <HI>I was my Fathers Son, he taught me also, and said unto me keep my Commandments and live.</HI> And sins against grace, and peculiar mercy do without Repentance
<PB N="52" REF="000274_0058_0FA45940ADEBD048"/>
end in Everlasting Rejection, Amos 3. 2. <HI>You only have I known, therefore will I punish you for all your ini∣quities.</HI> Who ever escape (saith the Lord) to be sure you shall not, because you sin against greater grace and favour then any others in the World ever did. For these causes the Lord threatned Eli that he would cut off his Arm, and the Arm of his Fathers house, inasmuch as he had sinned against peculiar mercies aud favours. Especially, sins against ten∣ders of Gospel grace provoke the Lord to cast men off, Math. 23. 37, 38. <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how of∣ten would I have gathered you, as an Hen her Chickens un∣der her wings but ye would not, and now your house is left unto you desolate.</HI> And this is sadly true concerning the Children of godly Parents, they sin against spe∣cial favours from the Lord, the means of grace is vouchsafed to them, they have many blessed stri∣vings of the holy Spirit with them, which others have not, therefore if they forsake the Lord no won∣der if he cast them off for-ever.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because such Children are guilty of lamentable Covenant breaking before the Lord, for the Covenant is with Children as well as Parents, Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12. <HI>You and your little ones do enter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Covenant,</HI> upon this account David saith that the Lord was his God from his Infancy, yea, from his first coming into the world, Psal. 22. 10, And the like is noted concerning Solomon, and therefore his Father said to him, <HI>my Son build the house of the Lord thy God,</HI> 1 Chron. 22. 11. The Lord is not only <HI>my God,</HI> but in respect of his gracious Covenant he is <HI>thy God</HI> also. And this seems to be the reason why Abraham is styled the Father of the faithful. <NOTE N="[g]" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Not meerly on the Covenant of the eminency of his faith, for we read of others in the Scripture, whose faith was not inferior to Abrahams, but in that he was
<PB N="53" REF="000274_0059_0FA45942A5144F40"/>
the first unto whom God expresly declared, <HI>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed,</HI> and withal appointed a sacred sign and Seal of this Covenant. Now Abra∣hams Covenant is as to the substance of it <HI>Everla∣sting.</HI> And therefore the Children of the faithful in all Ages, are wrapped under the bond of the Cove∣nant, otherwise there would be a substantial change of the Covenant from what it was at first, then which nothing can be more contradictory to the whole tenour and current of the Scripture. The Apo∣stle therefore testifyeth <HI>that the blessing of Abraham is come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ,</HI> Gal. 3. 14. As God said unto Abraham, I take thee and thy Children into Covenant with my self, so doth he through Je∣sus Christ say the like to every believing Parent a∣mong the Gentiles; And therefore the Lord Jesus did affirm concerning Children, <HI>of such is the King∣dome of Heaven,</HI> Math. 19. 14. <NOTE N="[b]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Math</HI> 5. 3. p; 61</NOTE> It is not only true (saith Christ) that Children did belong to God un∣der the old-Testament, but now that, <HI>the King∣dome of Heaven is at hand,</HI> now that the Church is to he under the heavenly dispensation of the Gospel, Children must be acknowledged there also. And it is for-ever to be observed, that when the New-Te∣stament dispensation was ready to be established, the ancient grant concerning Childrens Interest in the Covenant is expresly confirmed, Act. 2. 39. <HI>The pro∣mise is to you and to your Children.</HI> Hence then, if such Children do forsake the Lord, they are guilty of violating the Covenant. Now that's an iniquity which doth provoke the Lord to cast off those that are deeply guilty of it, Isai. 24. 5, 6. <HI>They have broken the Everlasting Covenant, therefore they are cursed, bur∣ned, desolate.</HI> In old time it was the manner that when a Covenant was made, some Creature or o∣ther was killed, and cut in pieces, by which rite was
<PB N="54" REF="000274_0060_0FA459444739EE08"/>
signified, that the Lord would kill and cut off him, that being in Covenant with God, did not make con∣science, faithfully to keep and observe, that Cove∣nant inviolable for-ever.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. From that infinite indignation, which is in the Lords heart against Apostates. They are fugitives from Christ, and deserting their Captain, the Lord himself will execute Martial Law upon them. No sinners are greater Objects of divine ha∣tred and indignation. Hence the Apostle said un∣to the Hebrews, when some of them were ready to Apostatize from Christianity to Judaisme, if any man draw back the Soul of God shall take no pleasure in him, Heb. 10. 38. meaning that such Creatures, are Vessels of dishonour, and the most loathsome Ob∣jects that can be thought of. Hence the Lord doth pursue them with infinite vengeance, he cuts them off, and casts them off for-ever. As that miserable <HI>Spira</HI> at the very moment, when he had renounced the Truth, thought he heard one say to him; <HI>Hence thou Apostate, and receive the Sentence of thy Eternal Damnation.</HI> The Lord is wont to leave marks of his wrath upon such sinners. He brands them, that all the world may be afraid of that iniquity, seldome hath it been known that any have notoriously turn∣ed away from the Lord, but visible wrath from Heaven hath fallen upon them. <HI>Jehoram</HI> had been religiously educated under his godly Father Jehosha∣phat, but he proved the Apostate child of a gracious Father; And what came on him? God let loose the Heathen Arabians, who wasted his Estate, and mur∣dered all his Children save one. Thus did the Lord cast him off. <HI>Joash</HI> was religiously educated under his uncle Jehojadah, but he forsook the Lord, therefore the Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ians with a small Army destroyed a great Host of his; And afterwards his own treacherous
<PB N="55" REF="000274_0061_0FA45A963811F930"/>
Servants murdered him. The like we read con∣cerning <HI>Amaziah.</HI> And Histories (besides what is recorded in the Scripture) are full of awful and ama∣zing Examples of the Lords indignation against A∣postates, and therefore since if Davids Children do forsake the Lord, they are to be reckoned amongst the number of Apostates, no wonder that he doth threaten to cast them off for-ever.</P>
<P>USE</P>
<P>We proceed now to a word of Application, and shall insist upon one only use of <HI>Exhortation, let us be exhorted in the Name and Fear of God this day, to endea∣vour that it may not be with us, as the Text and Doctrine expresseth,</HI> let us every one in our several places, and capacityes endeavour that the present and succeed∣ing Generations in New-England, may not forsake the Lord God of their Fathers, &amp; so endanger their being cast off for-ever.</P>
<P>Wherefore Consider, 1. <HI>What Fathers and Prede∣cessors have been,</HI> they were such as did seek the Lord. As for the body of the present Generation in New-England, it may be said to them, your Fathers were such as did serve the Lord, yea, it was love to God, and to Jesus Christ, which brought them into this Wilderness. As the Lord speaketh, Jer. 2. 2. <HI>I re∣member the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine Espou∣sals, when thou wentest after me in the Wilderness, in a Land which was not sown.</HI> Our Fathers did not in their coming hither propound any great matters to themselves respecting this world; only that they should have liberty to serve God; &amp; to walk with him in all the wayes of his worship. As one of our worthies hath aptly expressed, God sifted three Nations, that so he might bring over choice grain into this wilderness Let us then remember what <HI>New-England</HI> hath been. It hath been a noble Plant Jer. 2. 21. <HI>I plan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a noble Vine, wholly a right Seed.</HI> It hath been a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="56" REF="000274_0062_0FA45A97AB9A1C00"/>
our Eyes have seen the Lord fulfilling that Scrip∣ture litterally &amp; gloriously, Isai. 41. 19. <HI>I will plant in the Wilderness a Cedar.</HI> The chief of the Fathers in these New-English Churches, they were <HI>Abrahams.</HI> He, when God called him removed out of <HI>Ur</HI> of the Chaldees, to the place which the Lord would shew him, &amp; there built an Altar to the Everlasting God, so did our Fathers remove out of their own Land, when God called them, and came hither, to build an Altar here to the Everlasting God, yea, and they have set the Altar upon its right Basis too. Our Fathers have been <HI>Davids,</HI> that is to say, <HI>eminent Reformers.</HI> Let me speak freely (without offence to any) there never was a Generation that did so perfectly shake off the dust of Babylon, both as to Ecclesiastical and civil Constitution, as the first Generation of Christi∣ans, that came into this Land for the Gospels sake, where was there ever a place so like unto new Je∣rusalem as New-England hath been? It was once Dr. <HI>Twiss</HI> his opinion, <NOTE N="[i]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Letters printed in Mr. Medes works.

Truly that such a Type and em∣blem of new-Jerusalem, shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be erected in so dark a corner of the world, is matter of deep meditation and admiration.</P>
<P>Consider, 2. <HI>How subject men are, yea, the Children of blessed Parents and Predecessors to Apostatize from God.</HI> It is possible that the Children of David may forsake the Lord, and that in a short time too, when Predecessors have been eminent for God, their Suc∣cessors have been most degenerate, Jer. 2. 21. <HI>I plan∣ted thee wholly a right Seed, how art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange Vine unto me,</HI> Isai. 1. 21. <HI>How is the faithful City become an Harlot? it was full of Judgement, righteousness lodged in it, but now murde∣rers.</HI> It was sometimes said unto good Samuel, <HI>thy 
<PB N="57" REF="000274_0063_0FA45A996AD98738"/>
Sons walk not in thy wayes.</HI> And it is noted concern∣ing <HI>Nabal</HI> (a drunken Sot) that he was of the house of <HI>Caleb,</HI> 1 Sam. 25. 3. That ever such a branch should spring out of such a Stock. The Ephraimites were the vilest Idolaters of all the Apostate Children of Israel, yet they were the Posterity of Joseph the best of Jacobs twelve Sons. The perfidious and ungrateful Ziphites were also the posterity of that blessed <HI>Caleb</HI> but now mentioned. Yea, it is a sad Truth, that Religion hath seldome been upheld in the power of it, for above one or two Generations together. Therefore it is recorded concerning the Children of Israel, <HI>they turned quickly out of the way which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Command∣ments of the Lord, but they did not so,</HI> Judg. 2. 17. The Fathers and Leaders both of the first and second Ge∣neration were for purity of worship, but their Chil∣dren <HI>were not so.</HI> Their Fathers did endeavour to uphold Religion in the power of it, but <HI>their Chil∣dren did not so.</HI> Their Fathers did order their con∣versation according to the holy Rules of the word of God, but <HI>their Children did not so.</HI> Hence is that sad complaint by the Prophet, <HI>they rose early and cor∣rupted all their doings,</HI> Zeph. 3. 7. And if we look into the Scripture and view the story of former Ages, we shall see this to be true. The Posterity of the Lords Servants, the Children of the Church have in a lit∣tle time so forsaken him, as that solemn <HI>Reformation</HI> hath been necessary. Look beyond the Flood and we shall see it so. One of Adams Children with all his numerous Posterity forsook the Lord, Cain was ex∣communicate out of the Church and became the Fa∣ther of an excommunicate race and Generation. The first Church that ever was in the world, even that in Adam's Family continued in some measure pure, about the space <NOTE N="[k]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lib. 2.

<PB N="58" REF="000274_0064_0FA45A99DD9FFFE8"/>
years, (<HI>h. e.</HI> until Seth was born) but then great Apostacy prevailed. When the Church was small in one Family, it was more easy to keep it pure, by casting out the Apostates, but now the world grew numerous, &amp; a multitude of sinners caused impuni∣ty in sin, so as that they that were godly and consci∣entious were fain in the very beginning or first Ages and Generations of the world, to separate themselves and become distinct societies. Hence is that, Gen. 4. 26. <HI>then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</HI> It noteth a separation of the Church from the prophane world. After this, a second A∣postacy followed, that the Church and world were mixed together, even the Sons of God and daughters of men, the Posterity of godly <HI>Seth</HI> and of wicked <HI>Cain,</HI> until such time as the flood came and cleared the world of them, Gen. 6. 2. Then were the Inha∣bitants of the Earth in a most corrupt Estate, where∣fore the Psalmist (as it seems) alluding to that time faith, <HI>the Lord looked down from Heaven, to see if there were any that did understand and seek God, every one of them is gone back, they are altogether become filthy,</HI> Psal. 53. 2, 3. After Religion was revived in Noahs Family, his Posterity quickly forsook the Lord, <HI>Chams</HI> Apostacy was (as some Learned men observe) about forty years after the flood. The Church was reformed by his ejection, but within sixty or seventy years af∣ter that, the builders of Babel set upon their wicked attempt, which was desperate Rebellion against the Lord, although Noah himself was then alive, he could not by all his Authority restrain his grand Chil∣dren and Posterity, but they would needs become guilty of that Babel defection. After this, within a few Generations the world was overrun with Ido∣latry. When that iniquity first began is hard to say, but it is evident that in Jobs time (who is
<PB REF="000274_0065_0FA45A9A73F141A8"/>
thought to live about three hundred and fifty years after the Flood) the world was filled with Idolaters, yea, in Abrahams time there was such Apostacy as that Religion was almost gone out of the world; only in his Family there was a pure Church esta∣blished. Yet his Posterity did quickly forsake the Lord. The Ishmaelites, Midianites, Edomites, (and other Nations) who were of the Posterity of Abra∣ham, the Father of the faithful, in a few Genera∣tions lost the substantials of Religion, and were wholly deprived of their Church Estate. The Church was setled in Jacobs Family. Corruption and Su∣perstition did creep into his Family, so as that he was fain to set upon a work of solemn Reformati∣on, and that was not two hundred years after the Re∣formation begun in his grand-Father Abrahams Fa∣mily. After the Church was become National, the truth and power of Religion did very rarely conti∣nue above one or two Generations at the most (sometimes not so long) witness that Scripture <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>By Mr. Moodey.</HI></NOTE> which was worthily opened and applyed in this place upon the like solemn occasion two years ago, Judg. 2. 7, 10. And the People served the Lord all the dayes of Joshua, and all the dayes of the Elders that out-lived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel: <HI>And all that Generation were gathered unto their Fathers, and there arose another Generation after them, which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Is∣rael.</HI> Those that were the grand-Children of that Generation which was brought out of Egypt, did forsake the God, of their Fathers. Hence is that expression, Hos. 10, 9. <HI>O Israel thou hast sinned from the dayes of Gibeah,</HI> what horrible wickedness was in Gibeah, we may read in the ninèteenth &amp; twentyeth Chapters of the Book of Judges, where we have

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Story of the Levites Concubine, which though it be mentioned towards the close of that Book, yet it seems evident that it hapned before the Judges, for it seems that Jebus (afterwards Jerusalem) was not then taken, Judg. 19. 11, 12. when as that was taken by the Children of Israel before they were go∣verned by Judges, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 8.

Moreover, Phinehas the Son of Eleazar, the Son of <HI>Aaron</HI> was Priest in those dayes, Judg. 20. 28. which maketh it very manifest that, that most corrupt Generation, were the grand-Children of those, that were first embo∣dyed as a peculiar People, when the Lord did plant the Heavens, and lay the Foundations of the Earth, that is to say, did build up the Children of Israel as a body politick under Ecclesiastical and civil govern∣ment, the <HI>third Generation</HI> among that People proved degenerate and apostate. And when they were under a <HI>Theocracy</HI> or Government by Judges, whom the Lord immediately raised up and set over them, how soon did they turn aside from God; when any of their faithful Judges were taken from them, Judg. 2. 19. So in the dayes of the Kings. After <HI>Da∣vids Reformation</HI> Apostacy began in the very next Generation, in the dayes of his Son Solomon, and in the dayes of his grand-Child Rehoboam <HI>all Israel forsook the Lord,</HI> until God by a sad war awakened them to some Reformation. In Jehoshaphats time Religion was upheld in some power; but in the very next Generation there was Apostacy, Heze∣kiah was a great Reformer, but his Son Manasseh <HI>built up again the high places, which his Father had de∣stroyed, and seduced the People to do more evil then did the Nations, whom the Lord destroyed before the Chil∣dren
<PB N="59" REF="000274_0067_0FA45A9BF9DF1428"/>
of Israel.</HI> After this▪ Josiah wrought a great Reformation, and with him did the work of Refor∣mation and Religion, dye amongst the Jews, upon Josiahs death a flood of Land destroying sins brake in upon that Generation, that within the space of two and twenty years after Josiah was gathered unto his Fathers, the Jewish State both Civil and Ecclesiasti∣cal was quite overthrown; After the Captivity, Ez∣ra and Nehemiah, and the Prophets Haggai and Za∣chary were great Reformers; But Apostasy quickly prevailed, witness the Prophet <HI>Malachi,</HI> who decla∣reth that not only People but Rulers many of them in his dayes, were become very corrupt. Albeit they were not guilty of that more gross Idolatry, for which their Fathers were sent into Captivity, yet Covetousness, which is a spiritual Idolatry they were guilty of, whereby they provoked the Lord to send blasting Providences upon them, there being no greater punishment to a covetous man then to have the world taken from him. That Generation did not keep themselves unspotted of the World, upon which account, they are by the Prophet pronoun∣ced unclean, Hag. 2. 13, 14. And when Christ came into the world, he found the Jews in a most degene∣rate corrupt Estate. Therefore did the Lord call them an <HI>evil</HI> and an <HI>Adulterous,</HI> and a <HI>viperous Gene∣ration.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, since the <HI>Church</HI> hath been by di∣vine Institution <HI>Congregational,</HI> in these dayes of the New-Testament, men have been no less subject to Apostasy then in former Ages. The Churches in Galatia were strangely and suddenly overrun with corrupt Doctrine. Hence the Apostle saith, Gal. 1. 6. <HI>I marvel that you are so soon removed unto another Gospel.</HI> He might well marvel, if the observation of <NOTE N="[l]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap∣pellus in Histori Apostol,</HI></NOTE> great Chronologers be true, that within a year

And as for the Church in Ephesus they quickly de∣clined, Rev, 2, 5. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fal∣and repent, and do the first works.</HI> It was (as Histori∣ans observe) about twenty years after the Ascention of Christ that Paul gathered a Church amongst the Ephesians. And sixty years after the Ascention, the Book of the Revelation was written; So that there had been a Church in that place about forty-years; In which time the first members of the Church must needs (in probability) as to the body of them be dead, and another Generation of Church members were risen up which were not like the first. The Church in <HI>Thyatira,</HI> though not so Apostate when the Reve∣lation was written as some other Churches, yet Ec∣clesiastical Story mentions how that in a few years after that, there was no Church in that place; which was one Reason why some antient Hereticks <NOTE N="[n]" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> de∣nyed the divine Authority of the <HI>Apocalyps.</HI> Be∣cause therein mention is made of a Church in <HI>Thya∣tira,</HI> when as (said they) no Church is to be seen there. To which the Answer is that there had been a Church there only the <HI>Cataphrygian</HI> Heresy did pre∣vail so, as in a little time to swallow up the whole Church. In a word, in all those places, which we read of in the Scripture as having Churches in them, they that are the Successors at this day, are not like unto them that once were in those very places. In many places they have only the name not the Truth of Christianity, and in some not so much as the name. Albeit, when time was, famous Churches might
<PB N="61" REF="000274_0069_0FA45A9DEDFD0E58"/>
have been seen in those places. In former Ages <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> was the Seat of the Church, when as in these latter Ages <HI>Europe</HI> is so, <NOTE N="[o]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Med</HI></NOTE> which is judged the Reason why the Book of Revelation speaks of Events to come to pass chiefly in Europe; because since the ten Kings arose there, hath the Lord Christ seen meet to uphold and propagate his Church. What shall be said more? It is evident that in the Apostles dayes, the mystery of iniquity began to work, much more after they fell asleep, <HI>Ebion</HI> and <HI>Cerinthus</HI> sprang up whilst the Apostle <HI>John</HI> was yet living. The very next Ages to the Apostles began to depart from, and corrupt the simplicity of the Gospel, in divers re∣spects that might be mentioned, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egesyp∣pus</HI></NOTE> one long since ob∣served, that although the Church continued a Vir∣gin until after the Apostles death, then it was soon corrupted. It is conceived that <HI>Iude</HI> lived after most of the other Apostles were dead, which is judged to be the reason of his expressing himself as he doth in ver. 17. of his Epistle. Now he complaineth much of a great degeneracy amongst those that profossed Christianity.</P>
<P>Consider, 3. <HI>The present Generation in New-Eng∣land is lamentably degenerate.</HI> As sometimes Moses spake to the Children of Israel, Numb. 32. 14. <HI>Behold ye are risen up in your Fathers stead an increase of sinful men.</HI> So may we say, the first Generation of Chri∣stians in New-England, is in a manner gone off the Stage, and there is another and more sinful Genera∣tion risen up in their stead. We have in former years enjoyed a sun shine of prosperity, and that hath been attended (as useth to be) with great Apostasy. It is an apt similitude which some use, that as the heat of the Sun in Summer breeds a multitude of In∣sects, so doth the warmth of prosperity a multitude of Apostates. Men are leth to hear on this Ear, but
<PB N="62" REF="000274_0070_0FA45A9E9C0E9A18"/>
if we should deny it, the Lord doth testify against us that it is so, as Ioel. 1. 2. <HI>Hear this ye old men and give Ear all ye Inhabitants of the Land, hath this been in your dayes, or even in the dayes of your Fathers saith the Lord.</HI> Were there (saith the Prophet) such Judge∣ments for merly as now there are, you may therefore conclude that you are departed from God, and by your sins have provoked him so to punish you. Thus may it be spoken with reference to our State &amp; Case, and the dispensations of God towards us, you old men that are here before the Lord this day, what say you to this Question, did you know such Judgements up∣on New-England formerly, as of late we have seen? was it so in the dayes of our Fathers? were there such general and killing diseases? such a long continuing warr? so many hundreds cut of by the Sword, yea, so many hundred Familyes brought to ruine? Can∣dlesticks removed out of their places, and Plantations made desolate! In former times we heard of little besides settlement of Plantations, and gathering of Churches, but of late years, in stead of that, ruines have been multiplyed, yea, mischief upon mischief. God hath been spending his Arrows, and heaping mis∣chief upon this Generation. This Generation is not like the first. How many ignorant ones? how many scandalous ones? There is great rudeness amongst young ones in this Land; and in that respect degene∣racy from the good manners of the Christian world. And such sins as formerly were not known in <HI>New-England</HI> are now become common, such as swearing, sinful gaming, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yea, the present Generation as to the body of it, is an unconverted Generation. I would not lessen the grace of God, I know that through grace many of the younger Generation are brought home to God in Jesus Christ, yet in many (I donbt in most) Congregations, the number of sincere
<PB N="65" REF="000274_0071_0FA45AA10AA07968"/>
converts is but smal, comparatively with those that re∣main still in a natural &amp; unconverted Estate. And as for some that have the Root of the matter in them, yet they fall much short of their Fathers grace, Solomon was a good man and his Soul is now in Heaven, yet he was not like David his Father as to measure of grace and faithfulness, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 11. 6. we may see here and there, one that hath much of his blessed Fathers Spirit and Principles, but how rare are such amongst us? Nay, the Interest of <HI>New-England</HI> is now changed, from a Religious to a worldly Interest; and in this thing is <HI>the great Radical Apostasy of New-England.</HI> Is not this to chuse a strange God? Hence do we see warr in the gates. And the Lord hath been letting this Generation blood in the right vein, since be hath ta∣ken the world away from them. Trade is almost ruined. Farmes, Oxen, Merchandise, which things have been sought after in the first place, how have they failed? <HI>New-England</HI> is not like this twenty years, to be in that comfortable Estate it was in but two years agoe.</P>
<P>Consider, 4. <HI>There is sad cause to fear what will at last come on this Generation.</HI> There is a consumption on Religion all the world over, as one well observeth <NOTE N="[p]" PLACE="marg"><HI>v. Full filling Scripture In Epist. p. 2.</HI></NOTE> the buryals of Christians are frequent and their birth is rare. And as for what concerns ourselves more peculiarly, we may fear that there will be greater Apostasy, because they that should have pre∣vented it are gone. Many times the removal of a few eminent Servants of God in the Common-wealth, or in the Churches, maketh way for great Apostafie quickly to ensue was it not so with the Children of Israel? when they had a good Judge over them, they would serve the Lord all the dayes of that Judge, but it came to pass when the Judge was dead, they re∣turned and corrupted themselves more then their

Fathers, Judg. 2. 18, 19. In Nehemiahs time while he was Governour for twelve years together, things went well, and God blessed the Land wonderfully, but when he was removed, in one years time those sins of oppression, sensuality, Sabbath breaking, were become prevailing common evils, Neh. 13. 6. Alas! our Nehemiahs are gone, (I speak it not to reflect up∣on those that survive, but to awaken from the conside∣ration of our solemn bereavements) our Pauls are likewise departed from amongst us, in which respect we may fear corruption in Religion will follow, Acts 20, 29. Deut. 31. 27. Judg. 8. 33. Have we not seen it in some places, how that within a year after the death of such an eminent Servant of Christ, Apostasy to this day irrecoverable hath prevailed? Further∣more, the heads of the second Generation, that were most likely to have done good, the Lord hath snatch∣ed them away, and (like Enoch) translated them to Heaven, in the midst of their dayes; others that are most likely to prevent backsliding, and to be Instru∣ments of reforming a corrupted Generation, are not likely to continue long in this evil world, yea, and of late even since the present warr, that we are bleeding under, began, the Lord hath taken away many young ones, either by Sword or sickness, who were the hopes of the Generation. In many Plantations, they that have dyed of late, were the most hopeful and de∣sireable young men in the places where they lived, an Ominous sign that there is some terrible thing, which God will do, e're this Generation be passed away.</P>
<P>Consider, 5. <HI>How sad it would be if succeeding Ge∣nerations should forsake the Lord.</HI> It is evident, from the considerations mentioned, that it may be so, but it would be dismal if indeed it should be so. <HI>New∣England</HI> would then become of all Lands the most dark and miserable. How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doth the Prophet

speak of <HI>Bethaven,</HI> now what was that <HI>Bethaven?</HI> even the same that was in former times <HI>Bethel,</HI> i. e. the house of God, Hos. 4. 15. with 1 King. 12. 29. Am. 5. 5. If such places where the house of God hath been erected do once degenerate, they are like to become <HI>Bethavens,</HI> places of greatest vanity and iniquity in the world. Hence is that, Hos. 9. 15. <HI>all their wick∣edness is in Gilgal.</HI> Gilgal was once famous upon Re∣ligious accounts. <HI>There</HI> was the Covenant renew∣ed by Circumcision, <HI>there</HI> was the first Passover kept by the Children of Israel, after their coming into the promised Land, <HI>there</HI> did God appear to Joshua, <HI>there</HI> was to be seen a famous Monument of the Lords do∣ing wonders for his people, <HI>there</HI> was the Taberna∣cle for some time, but in after Generations an Idola∣trous Temple was built there, so as that it was a foun∣tain of much wickedness. <HI>All their wickedness was in Gilgal.</HI> It seemeth the Altar of witness was near that place, which through mens corruptions might easily be abused unto much Superstition in after Ages. The Devil seeketh to corrupt those places especially, which once were famous for Religion. As <HI>Polanus</HI> ob∣serveth that <HI>Wittenberge</HI> in Germany was the Town where the Reformation in <HI>Luthers</HI> time began,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> and therefore the Devil did seek to corrupt that place especially, and caused it to become the Seat of grie∣vous Herosies. What Land under Heaven, hath been more noted for profession and Religion, then <HI>New-England?</HI> If Apostacy prevail amongst such a People, it is like to be a sad Apostacy indeed. We see it already; Hence there are such sad complaints of young men that have been bred and born in New∣England, when they go abroad into other Lands that none are so debauched and prophane as some of them. If the Lord should be provoked to pluck up the Hedge of civil government, what a fearful flood
<PB N="68" REF="000274_0074_0FA45AA66C403B58"/>
of iniquity would soon break in? How would mad∣ded and inraged profaneness know no bounds? yea, this Land would become as Sodom, and then most desolating plagues will in short time follow, Ezek. 33. 28. what became of Cain's degenerate race? when they were become, I know not how many millions, the flood swept away every mothers child of them. wherefore all the Children of men that are now in the world are styled <HI>the Children of Seth,</HI> Numb. 24. 17. <NOTE N="[q]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bel∣gick Annot</HI></NOTE> because as for Cain's Apostate Generation they all perished in the flood. When the old world did Apostatize, after the Reformation in the dayes of <HI>Seth,</HI> that second Apostasy proved fatal. If Church∣es in New-England degenerate, it is an Apostasy af∣ter Reformation. How fatal is such a relapse like to be? will not the end thereof be with a flood? And truly to be amongst the last Apostates, will be most woful.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But what shall be done in order to prevention of Apostasy?</HI> what shall be done, that so succeeding Ge∣nerations in <HI>New-England</HI> may not forsake the Lord God of their Fathers?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> As I have been meditating an Answer to this Enquiry, I could not but call to mind that Scrip∣ture which some of the chief of the Fathers (at least wise those two, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>My Father Cotton &amp; My Father Mather.</HI></NOTE> whom I have more Reason then any one in the world to think of) have upon the like solemn occasion, improved many years since, I mean that Scripture, Hag. 2. 4. <HI>Yet now be strong O Zerub∣babel saith the Lord, and be strong O Joshua, and be strong all ye People of the Land.</HI> If Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the People of the Land, if Magistrates, Ministers, and People all do what duty requireth, the feared. Apo∣stasy, together with the unavoidable calamity coming therewith, may be prevented, however in great measure and for a long time.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="69" REF="000274_0075_0FA45AA68CB8D600"/>1. Let me apply my Speech unto Zerubbabels, <HI>h. e.</HI> Rulers in the Common-Wealth. Honoured and much esteemed, the welfare or ill fare of the present, yea, and following Generation doth much depend up∣on you, <HI>Magistrates</HI> are in the Scripture compared to <HI>Corner stones,</HI> because where there is a Common-Wealth erected, the safety of the whole building (under God) depends much upon them. Hence are they also termed Foundations, Psal. 11. 3. If the foun∣dations be destroyed what can the righteous do? If David had perished, Foundations had been destroyed, and the good People of the Land would have dearly felt the loss of him. And when in Sauls time there were corrupt Judges and Magistrates, it is therefore said, that the <HI>Foundations</HI> of the Earth were out of Course, Psal. 82. 5. And the Prophet Micah speaking to the Rulers in the Common-wealth of Israel saith, <HI>hear ye Foundations of the Earth,</HI> Mic. 6. 2. It is with you (by the help of Christ) to lay such Foundations as shall make Posterity either happy or miserable. David improved the power which God in his Provi∣dence entrusted him with, <HI>to serve his Generation ac∣cording to the will of God,</HI> Acts 13. 36. And therefore was an eminent blessing to all that Generation where∣in he lived. If the sins of the People under your care and charge should ever provoke the Lord, to leave you in an hour of Temptation, you cannot pos∣sibly turn aside from God alone, but many others will do so too. <HI>Regis ad Exemplum,</HI> People are apt to follow the Examples of those in place. you know it is mentioned concerning Rehoboam, that he within few years after his coming to the Government did forsake the Lord, and all Israel with him, 2 Chron. 11. 1. Let me then with all due respect to your pla∣ces, and to your worth, and yet with that freedome and faithfulness which becometh a Messenger of the

Lord of Hosts, propound some things to you, which concern the welfare of this, and after Generations in New-England.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I pray you in the Name of the Lord, that a speedy &amp; Effectul Course may be taken, that the great things that God did for our Fathers, in planting these Heavens, and laying the Foundations of this Earth, be faithfully record∣ed, and transmitted to Posterity.</HI> This hath been thought of, and spoken of long enough, but why is it not done? If it be neglected till the present Generation be pas∣sed away, the next will be less capable of doing it. The Title of the Book wherein my Text is, leads me to Insist on this. Why is this Book called the <HI>Chrom∣cles,</HI> but because it contains a <HI>Record</HI> and relation of the things which God did for his People in antient time, yea, from time to time. The Hebrews have termed it, <HI>[dibre hajamin] words of dayes</HI> probably (as <NOTE N="[r]" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> some conceive) taken out of the royal <HI>Diaryes</HI> of those times, by divine direction and Inspiration; this Book of Chronicles being an unerring <NOTE N="[s]" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Epito∣me</HI> of those Chronicles mentioned in the Kings. The Truth is, that above half the old-Testament is a Chro∣nicle of things done, by the Lord, for his People in the years of Antient Generations. You have then Scripture Example abundantly to encourage, in pro∣moting a work of this nature. Hence we read of the Book of <HI>Jasher,</HI> 2 Sam. 1. 18. and of the Book of <HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet, and of <HI>Gad</HI> the Seer, 1 Chron. 29. 29. and of <HI>Abijah,</HI> the Shilonite, and of <HI>Shemaiah</HI> the Prophet, 2 Chron. 12. 15. and the Story of the Prophet <HI>Iddo,</HI> 2 Chron. 13. 22. There is also plain Scripture precept <NOTE N="[t]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr. Mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>als Ser∣mon on Psal.</HI> 102. 18. p. 35.</NOTE> as well as Example to move hereunto, see Psal. 78. 5, 6 <HI>For he established a Testimo∣ny in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Israel which he com∣manded our Fathers, that they should make them known to their Children, that the Generations to come, might know these▪
<PB N="71" REF="000274_0077_0FA45AA8AE57C8E8"/>
even the Children which should be born, who should arise, and declare them to their Children.</HI> And again, Psal. 102. 18. <HI>This shall be written for the Generations to come.</HI> So that this is a duty incumbent upon present Genera∣tions to take care that there be a Record of the great works of God towards them, for the benefit of the Generations that shall follow, that so God may be glorified. I perceive that some good men are afraid lest our too great neglect in this matter, may be one thing that God is offended at. And there be two considerations. which may cause such apprehensions not to seem groundless, one is in that this thing hath been formerly urged. <NOTE N="[w]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr. She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pards El∣ection S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mon p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> That faithful <HI>Shepard</HI> who spake here in the Name of the Lord upon the like oc∣casion, five years agoe, insisted upon this very thing, and yet the matter remains unfinished to this day. Moreover, whilst the body of the first Generation, whom God planted in this Wilderness was alive, there were Essays this way, for it <NOTE N="[†]" PLACE="marg"><HI>See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Com∣mission Sept. 9.

Now that such things should be concluded, and yet never done cannot please God. Furthermore, how can we te∣stify to Posterity our gratitude towards God, for the great things he hath done for our Fathers, and for us their Children, in more respects then can be now mentioned, except such a lasting Record and Monu∣ment as is now spoken of, be brought to persection.

And this may (by the blessing of Christ) be one good means to prevent Apostasy, The Lord therefore commanded his People of old, to keep a Record of his works and signal Providences towards them, that so their Children after them might set their hope in God and keep his Commandments, Psal. 78. 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I pray you in the Name of the Lord, to take care for the propagation of the Interest of the Gospel,</HI> that the good knowledge of the Lord may be amongst the people under your Government in your time; yea, and af∣ter that also. If ignorance overspread the Land Apostasy will do so too. Hence David here saith, <HI>know thou the Lord God</HI> of thy Father and serve him, but if thou <HI>forsake him,</HI> &amp;c. intimating, that except succeeding Generations know the Lord, they will not serve him, but forsake him. Therefore it con∣cerns the Magistrate, to take effectual care, that the Land be furnished with able and faithful Ministers; So we read of Jehoshaphat, that he caused Levites to be sent into all the Cities of Judah who taught the People, 2 Chron. 17. 8, 9. And this stands upon Re∣cord to his everlasting Renown. It is not every man that is fit to be employed as a pulick Teacher, Ez∣ra saith (Chap. 8. 17, 18. that he sent unto such and such, that they would bring unto him <HI>Ministers for the house of God,</HI> and that by the good hand of God they

No doubt but one reason why the Lord hath let loose the Heathen against us, hath been, because some Plantations have been ere∣cted, and yet no publick acknowledgement of God amongst them, but they have lived like Heathen, without Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ths, without the word and Prayer, which are moral duties that all are bound to attend: and it is therefore incument on the Magistrates to see that they do so. People are ready to run wild into the woods again, and to be as heathenish as ever, if you doe not prevent it: Take care also I beseech you, for the propagation of the Gospel amongst these poor Indians. You know it is expressed in the <HI>Pátent,</HI> as one main end proposed by our Fathers in their coming into this Wilderness, that so they might en∣deavour the Conversion of the Natives, and set up the Kingdome of the Lord Jesus amongst them. God by the late War hath made way for the Gospel to be entertained amongst them, more then formerly; should not this be considered!</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I beseech you in the Name of the Lord, that you would in special manner beware of that which was the sin of Solomon:</HI> and what was that? Truly sinfull Tole∣ration was Solomons great iniquity, whereby he did forsake the Lord. It is said of him, he built high places for Ashtaroth, 2 King.23. 13. because he did tolerate and give publick allowance, unto those Ido∣latryes: and that sin of his was the reason why the Lord stirred up Adver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aryes against him.

to pull down false worship, as well as to set up the true worship of God.

No more (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith <HI>Calvin</HI>) doe we read in the New Testament, that the Magistrate; did ever punish men for murder, or other crimes, doth it therefore fol∣low that he ought not so to doe?

<P N="4">4. <HI>Labour (I likemise pray you in the Name of the Lord) to the utmost of your power, that the work of Reformation may be promoted in this Generation.</HI> I shall not need to insist here, because this Argument was abundantly and worthily enlarged on <NOTE N="[g]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. Torrey in his Elect on Serm▪</HI></NOTE> by him that spake in the Name of the Lord on this occasion three years agoe. Since that, the holy dispensations of God towards this People have been very dreadful, so that the Lord calls for Reformation, now more then ever. If things should pass away thus, and the Generation that is to come should not see, that some notable thing was done with respect to a Reforma∣tion of provoking evils, it would be sad indeed; and the more sad, in that there have been <HI>Essays</HI> this way, and since the late (and to this day not fully ended) <HI>Warr,</HI> a Committee appointed by the general Court to enquire into the causes of the high displeasure of God, which hath been manifested, and such and such evils, concluded to be matters of provocation, and Laws enacted for the suppression of them,&amp; shall it all come to just nothing at last? shall we dare to dally with the Almighty in things of this nature? The Lord may respite us for a while, but except there be a Reformation of provoking evils, we have no Rea∣son to expect otherwise, but that a <HI>worse thing will come unto us,</HI> &amp; that he will punish us yet seven times for our sins. And how is there like to be that Refor∣mation which the Lord requireth, except you that are Leaders over this people, do you utmost to pro∣mote

it? where do you read of any great and gene∣ral Reformation brought to pass, except the civil Magistrate did forward it? It is true, that many times God doth make use of his Messengers and Ministers to set the Wheel a going, but then Magistrates have fallen in with them. The Prophets <HI>Haggai and Za∣chary</HI> set the work of Reformation upon the Wheel, but <HI>Zerubbabel and She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltiel</HI> (godly Magistrates) car∣ryed on the work to Effect, Ezra.5.1,2. <HI>Luther</HI> be∣gan the Reformation in Germany, yet if some of the Princes there, had not engaged with him, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ead the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves of Lu <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, Cal∣vin, Zuing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us, Oec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ius, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>allerus.</HI></NOTE> the work had never been carryed on with such success. <HI>Calvin</HI> (and other eminent Ministers of God) exhorted the People at <HI>Geneva,</HI> unto Reformation, but if the Se∣nators of that place had not hearkened to the voice of God in those Exhortations, the People would have remained unreformed still. <HI>Zwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glius</HI> by his Mini∣stry was instrumental towards the accomplishing a great Reformation in <HI>Zurick,</HI> but then the Magi∣strates of that place fell in with the Word of God. <HI>Oecolampadius</HI> was an happy Instrumeut in the hand of Christ to reform <HI>Basil;</HI> but if the Magistrates of that City had not set to their helping hand, <HI>Oecolampadius</HI> alone might have laboured in vain. The like is to be said concerning the Reformation of <HI>Bern,</HI> (not to insist on more Instances) where that learned <HI>Halle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> was once a preacher of the Gospel. I know you cannot change mens hearts, yet you may do much (if God help you) towards the effecting an outward Re∣formation, which will, procure outward blessings and prevent outward Judgements and desolations. There is pride in the hearts of men, you cannot re∣form that, but there is pride in Apparel which the Lord hath said he will punish for, you may cause that to be reformed. There is drunkenness in the sight of God, which doth not fall under your Cognizance, but
<PB N="81" REF="000274_0087_0FA45AB4AD3DC1B0"/>
Drunkenness in the sight of men, and the occasions of it, do; which you may and ought to remove. I know not any evil, that hath brought more misery upon this generation then that hath, and some that have Rea∣son to know it, have told me that there hath been more Drunkenness amongst the Indians, since this war, then there was before; undoubtedly there is a fault somewhere, that good Laws are not executed upon those that shall transgress in this kind, and that the course propounded and enacted by the general Court, for the suppressing of this growing evil hath not been duly attended. Again, as for scandalous Contentions, you may do much towards the healing of them. All the world knoweth, that there hath been an unhappy breach between two of the Church∣es in this great Town. If every one of you that are in place, shall do what you can, and what the Lord Je∣sus would have you do, to help in this case, we may hope that wofnl breach will (by the help of Christ) soon be healed, and much sin and Judgement that is otherwise like to follow, will be prevented. And the Lord calls aloud about this matter; The burning which he hath kindled in this place, the voice of the Lord in it is, <HI>out with your sinful fires, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I give you burning for burning.</HI> And since that, this Town hath been endangered more by fire then ever it was since the day I knew it. Therefore I come to you in the Name of the Lord, and beseech you to consider of this matter, lest the Lord kindle another fire in <HI>Bo∣ston</HI> ere long, that shall burn to the Foundation of the Mountains. And I do the rather mention this thing, because the Subject I am upon, leads me to it, the welfare of Posterity being concerned therein, it may be the sowre grapes which the Fathers have eaten will set your Childrens teeth on edge, I <NOTE N="[h]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. Burroughs Irenicum▪ p.</HI> 220.</NOTE> remem∣ber blessed Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> in his <HI>Irenicum</HI> taketh no∣tice

The Lord help us to consider of it.</P>
<P>And now I shall turn my speech from you that are <HI>Zerubbabels</HI> amongst this People: I doubt not but you consider that I have spoken these things, not as a friend only, but as in the Capacity of an unworthy Ambassador of the most high God unto you this day. And methinks my Conscience bears me witness in the holy Ghost, that an earnest desire that the will of God might be done, hath caused me thus to express my self; As also a desire that you might have comfort both now and in <HI>that day</HI> when you must give up your account to the Son of God, concerning your Steward∣ship, which in his Providence he hath entrusted you with; and that your names might be honourably spoken of in the next Generation, when you shall be in your graves. It is no honour to Jehu's name that <HI>in his dayes God began to cut Israel short,</HI> 2 King.10.32. nor to Jehoram in that it is recorded to Posterity, that <HI>in his dayes the Edomites revolted,</HI> 2 Chron.21. 18. Nor will it be for your honour, if the next Generation shall say, once such and such Worthies and Patriots had the management of affairs in <HI>New-England,</HI> and in their dayes things went well, God did bless and build, and prosper the Land, but after they were
<PB N="83" REF="000274_0089_0FA45AB6308C7F50"/>
gone, the work fell into other hands, and <HI>in their dayes</HI> there was trouble upon trouble, wars, sicknes∣ses, Sword, Fire, desolations in every corner of the Land, for it (thus to be spoken) would not be for your honour. But now that it should be said, though the Lord afflicted the Land for a while, you caused the People under your charge to turn unto the Lord, &amp; then God did own them, and bless them more then ever, this will be to your honour amongst men in this world, and more to your joy when you shall appear before Jesus Christ, then if Crowns of Diadems should be set upon your heads. The Lord grant it may be so.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me humbly propose this Exhortation to those that are Ministers in the house of God. There are many such before the Lord in this great Assembly.

Give me leave to mention two or three words, which if the Lord help us to remember them, we shall serve our Generation according to the will of God.</P>

We have need therefore to be much in Prayer, and Humiliations before the Lord, that so he might vouchsafe to shew us the form of the House, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof.</P>

Many an one that minds not a Sermon, yet when he is by a Messenger of God particularly spoken to, and told, you are yet in your sins: if you be not new born, bet∣ter you had never been born; he falls down under conviction. And possibly words that we little think any such thing of now, will be mentioned again to our exceeding joy and rejoycing in the day of Christ when we shall see and hear many Souls stand forth and bless the Lord Jesus that ever they knew us, &amp; that ever we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake to them in the Name of the Lord both publickly and privately; even in the day when each of us that hath been faithfull in his Generation, shall say, <HI>Lord here am I, and the Children that thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast given me.</HI> Moreover, if we would convert Souls, and be blessings indeed to this Generation, it con∣cerns us to be very careful of our personal Conversa∣tion, &amp; what examples we set before others. If we doe not live Sermons as well as preach them, we are not likely to doe any great good. For a Minister of.

and study the Statutes of the Land, instead of the Sta∣tutes of Heaven; for them to appear as Advocates, and plead Causes in civil Courts of Judicature, it is very uncomely. One of the Ancients observeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jerom.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Sacerdos in Foro, et Mercator in Templo</HI> is not to be tolerated.

When the Prophets of Jerusalem are light Persons, Profaness goeth forth into all the Land.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Oh! that our occasional Meetings might be impro∣ved for the good of this, and after Generations.</HI> Because of the capacity and holy Relation we stand in before the Lord, it is expected we should not be like other men, they may meet together, and spend that time in discourses of their own personal concerns; but we have the care and charge of Souls committed to us. Yea (in our measure) the care of all the Churches ought to be upon us: nay, more, we must be solli∣citous for those that shall come after us. Such a publick spirit well becometh our publick capacity, &amp; therefore upon all occasions to speak and act accor∣dingly. And verily, the Lord will write down these discourses in his book of Remembrance, and we

<P>Let me in the last place, direct my speech and Ex∣hortation in the Name of the Lord, unto the people of this Land. There are here present those that are <HI>Deputed</HI> to act in the name and stead of the people of this Jurisdiction. You have a great opportunity put into your hands by the providence of God, to doe service for this and after Generations, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by endea∣vouring the establishment of righteous and religious Laws in the Common-wealth, that so the Lord Jesus might reign there. Especially, let me propound to you, that you would take some effectual course, that good Laws which are already established, may be du∣ly executed; And that some further care might be taken for the suppressing of that wickedness that is usually committed the night after the Sabbath, God hath lately kindled a fire in this place, and it was on the night after the Sabbath, why should we wonder at it? I cannot speak it without some anguish of Spi∣rit, there is more wickedness committed usually on that night then in all the week besides. Therefore think of some expedient to help in this case, Let me also mention another thing to you; I have former∣ly

upon a solemn occasion mentioned it to the Ho∣noured Magistracy, and therefore now apply myself to you; it is this, that you would recommend unto the Churches in this Colony a solemn renewal of their Covenant with God and one another. That is a great Scripture expedient for Reformation. Do not think that this is any new notion, but it is a known Principle owned and avowed by <NOTE N="[o]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cart wright, Parker, Ames,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> the good old non-Conformists, (whose Children we are) <HI>That re∣new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Covenant is the way to attain Church Reforma∣tion,</HI> which Principle was much improved by the chief of the Fathers, of these New-English Churches, (and therefore I the rather insist upon it) this is the way to prevent Apostasy. The Covenant was renewed in the dayes of Joshua, when as the Scripture testify∣eth, that in his dayes the Children of Israel continued to serve the Lord, wherefore Divines observe, that Joshuahs special designe in putting the People upon renewing their Covenant, was that so they might be kept from future Aposta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. I do therefore in the Name of the Lord, commend this matter to you, and leave it with you, and God incline your hearts to do that which shall be pleasing in his sight. And if the Lord intend not further shakings and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olations a∣mongst these Churches, I am perswaded that this motion will be hearkned unto, and complyed with. Moreover, there are many others of the People of the Land here, before the Lord this day, a considerable part of the present Generation is met together in this great Assembly; a few words let me speak to you, and leave with you, that so you may not forsake the Lord, the God of your Fathers.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us labour to be rightly informed respecting Prin∣ciples which our Fathers owned.</HI> There are mistakes in the minds of some, who think that the Fathers of this Colony, affirmed thus and so, albeit, it was fat

from them, so to teach, or so to think, I shall not (be∣ing now in earnest, and desirous to speak with ut∣most solemnity) enter upon things which are more Controversal amongst us, but certain it is, that our Fathers alwayes owned and avowed this Principle of Truth, <HI>that nothing should be admitted into the worship of God but what there is Scripture warrant for,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>larks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> 493.</NOTE> <HI>nor anything neglected which the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath instituted.</HI> The cause of the second Commandment was that which our Fa∣thers were ingaged in the defence of. And as to Church Administrations, <HI>that things should be reduced to the Primitive, Apostolical pattern.</HI> An excellent principle, albeit, that blessed Martyr, Mr. <HI>Laurence Saunders</HI> was accused of Heresy for asserting it. And I remember that great learned man and blessed <HI>M</HI>ar∣tyr <HI>Peter Ramus,</HI> professeth in one of his Epistles, that the deep consideration of this Principle, <NOTE N="[p]" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Epist.

And indeed <HI>the Con∣gregational way truly stated,</HI> is that which our Fathers have stedfastly owned and avowed, that is to say, as it is held forth in the platform of Discipline, and by Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in his Book of the Keyes; they were not for Presbyteriani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, nor yet for Browni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Keep up the power of Discipline in Churches.</HI> When Apostasy prevailed, in the Asiatick Churches there was the original wound. They did not bran∣dish the Sword of Discipline, which is Christs own expedient, and appointment, for the preservation of Churches in purity; yea, this was a fatal neglect, which by degrees proved ruinous to those once fa∣mous
<PB N="91" REF="000274_0097_0FA45ABCF28FC960"/>
and glorious Churches. Some learned men <NOTE N="[q]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Voe∣tius alicu∣bi inter disputati∣ones.</HI></NOTE> have well observed, that the neglect of Discipline in the Churches of Asia brought in corruption of man∣ners, and corruption of manners was (through the just revenging hand of God) attended with corrupti∣on of Doctrine, and these together provoked the Lord, to lay those Churches most desolate. And as for the Children of the Covenant let Discipline be extended towards them, according as they are Sub∣jects capable thereof. Did not our Fathers come hi∣ther in hope that they should leave their Children, under the Discipline and Government of the Lord Jesus in his Church? Hath not Christ owned the ap∣plication of solemn publick Admonitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to some of them that have been Children of the Church, (though not in full Communion) even so as to con∣vert their Souls thereby? why then should disputes about the mode wholly evacuate the thing, when so much of the welfare of Souls, and the Interest of Christs Kingdome is concerned therein</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Look to your Families.</HI> Families are the Nurce∣ryes for Church and Common-wealth, ruine Fami∣lies, and ruine all. Order them well and the pub∣lick State will fare the better; the great wound and misery of <HI>New-England</HI> is that Familes are out of Order. As to the generality of house holders, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Read Mr. Stockton of Family Instruction▪</HI></NOTE> Family Government is lost, &amp; gone; Servants do not fear their Masters, Children do not honour their Parents, in that respect the <HI>English</HI> are become like unto the <HI>In∣dians.</HI> Let Christians make conscience of it as their duty, to rule their own houses well, and be careful that Family Instruction be upheld; the Judgements of God should awaken to this. In some Families the Children have no Father left to instruct them, in other Families Fathers have no Children left to be instructed by them, by these terrible Judgements
<PB N="92" REF="000274_0098_0FA4586E14122F00"/>
they that have Familyes, should learn to be diligent in Instructing of them, whilst they, have an opportu∣nity so to do; And this is the way to prevent Aposta∣sy, for ignorance is the mother (not of devotion but) of Heresy. Vsually, they that prove Hereticks, are such as were never well grounded in the knowledge of Principles, never well instructed in Catechetical Fundamental Doctrines and points of Religion. The <HI>Waldenses</HI> <NOTE N="[r]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Read <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Histo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Wal∣denses.</HI></NOTE> preserved and propagated the Interest of Religion by diligence, in catechising their Chil∣dren. When certain <HI>Jesuits</HI> were sent amongst them to entice them from the Truth to Idolatry, they returned amazed, professing that Children of seven years old amongst those <HI>Waldenses</HI> knew more in the Scripture, and of the Mysteries of the Gospel, then many of their learned Doctors did. Take heed al∣so how you dispose of your Children, you that are Parents look at Religion and the fear of God, in dis∣posing of your Children. That blessed man Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> (the Moses of his time) would sometimes bewail it, that Professors of Religion would say, <HI>there is a portion &amp; Civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, &amp; we will hope for grace; but</HI> (said he) <HI>rather make sure of grace, and hope for riches, there is far greater Reason for it, since Godliness hath the Promises, riches have none.</HI> It may make us dread to think what's coming, in that it is with us, as it was with the old world, the Sons of God are marrying with the daughters of men. Church members in disposing of their Children look more at portion then at piety. If their Children are like to live well in the world, and their Familyes to be made richer, they look no further; a sad sign that Religion will expire, and such Familyes be cut off from the Covenant, within a few Generations, and the branches thereof perish for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pray with all manner of prayer and supplication in the Spirit▪</HI> Pray as sometimes the Martyr did, <HI>Lord
<PB N="93" REF="000274_0099_0FA4586629E7D050"/>
do not thou forsake me, left I forsake thee.</HI> Pray for your poor Children and Posterity, as David did for his Son Solomon, 1 Chron.29. 19. <HI>give unto my Son Solomon a perfect heart.</HI> He did not only exhort &amp; charge his Son to labour after such an heart, but earnestly prayed to God, that such an heart might be given to him▪ And truly, if there were more prayers poured forth before the Lord, for the conversion of <HI>the Rising Ge∣neration,</HI> we may hope that there would a blessed Ef∣fect follow. I have been told that there is a Church in <HI>New-England,</HI> that hath set dayes apart only to seek unto the Lord, for converting grace to be vouch∣safed to their children. O that all other Churches would do as they have done, even seek unto the Lord by Fasting and Prayer, for a poor, perishing, dying, unconverted Generation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, <HI>Be faithful in improving of your Civil Liber∣tyes.</HI> Beware of two extreams, of an <HI>Issacharian Spi∣rit,</HI> to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch under every Imposer: if you foolishly lose your Libertyes, your Posterity, yea, the children that are yet to be born will rue it. Beware also of a <HI>wanton Spirit,</HI> lest you provoke the Lord, by bitter bondage to make you know the worth of Liberty. It is a great priviledge which you enjoy this day, that you may chuse Rulers from amongst yourselves. And although as to what concerns the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nsactions of this day, it is almost too late to speak, yet you may <HI>hear for the time to come.</HI> Freemen remember the Oath of God that is upon you. I doubt there is lamentable guilt upon many, who in <HI>Elections</HI> are acted more by Interest and Faction, then by Conscience. You know what the Rule is, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that you should chuse men that are Just and that fear God, and that hate Covetous∣ness. Chuse men that shall approve themselves (like Eliakim) Fathers to the Inhabitants of Jerusa∣lem, chuse men of Hezekiahs Spirit, who <HI>spake com∣fortably
<PB N="94" REF="000274_0100_0FA458667A9CDA30"/>
to all those that taught the good knowledge of the Lord.</HI> In a word, chuse those that will be zealous for the Interest of Reformation, and that therefore will improve their power, to suppress transgressions of the first, as well as of the second Table. If you will chuse such (which mercy forbid that ever it should be) un∣der whose shadow thorns and bryars shall thrive, and those weeds of pride, contention, Heresy shall receive nourishment, and encouragement; It will be an ominous sign, that God will ere long, deprive you of your Libertyes, until such time as you know better how to improve them. And now I hope I may say, that as to the opportunity put into my hands, this day, I have discharged my Conscience, delivered my Soul, and can lay down my head with peace. I con∣clude with <HI>Moses,</HI> calling Heaven and Earth to Re∣cord, that life and death hath been set before this Ge∣neration. O Generation see the Word of the Lord, chuse life, that both thou and thy Seed may live. And God from Heaven saith, O that there were such an heart in this Generation that they would fear me, that so it may go well with them, and with their Children for ever, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>

in this Remembring? 2. How it doth appear that young men ought to remember God? 3. The Reason why they especially should doe so?</P>
<P>Quest. 1 <HI>What is requ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in this Remembring which the Text▪ speaks of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is a known Rule, that in the Scripture words of Sense doe imply the affections and actions. So here, it is not every kind of Remembrance of God, but that which is affectionate and practical that is inten∣tended▪ Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This Remembring doth imply a Turning to the Lord,</HI> Psal.22.27. <HI>All the ends of the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld shall remember, and Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Lord:</HI> Vnfeigned Repentance is imply∣ed in this Remembrance.

A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it is a penitential Remembrance which Solomon here speaketh of▪ Remember thy Creator, that is, Re∣member to make thy peace with him, and therefore to Repent of Sin, and turn to God in the dayes of thy Youth.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Remembrance which the Text speaketh of, doth imply Service and Obedience. Psal. 119. 55. <HI>I have remembred thy name, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept thy law.</HI> As they that neglect the worship and Service which they owe to the blessed God, are said to forget him▪ Psal.9.17. <HI>The wicked shall be turned into d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll, and all the Nations that forget God.</HI> That is to say, they that doe not serve God. When the Children of Israel had forsaken the wayes, and corrupted the worship of God, it was said, <HI>Israel hath forgotten his Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er▪</HI> Hos.8.14. So on the other hand, the Service of God is noted by that of Remembring him▪ Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy Youth, h.e. Seek and serve him betimes. As David exhorted his Son So∣lomon,
<PB N="98" REF="000274_0104_0FA4586B0A8396E0"/>
whilst yet in his Youth, 1.Chron.28.9.<HI>Know, and serve the Lord with a perfect heart and a willing mind.</HI> Hence the Performance of all religious dutyes, es∣pecially that great duty of Prayer, is implyed in this Remembring which the Text speaketh of. Jon.2.7. <HI>I Remembred the Lord▪</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith the Prophet) and how was that? it followeth, <HI>my Prayer came unto thee, into thine holy Temple.</HI> We read in the Gospel of Children that prayed unto the Lord, they said <HI>Hosann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> i. e. Save now we beseech thee. Math. 21. 15. That is implyed in Remembring God the Crea∣tor,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It doth also imply frequent thoughts and Medita∣tions of God,</HI> Psal.63.6. <HI>When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</HI> Where there is that Remembrance of God which the Text requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth, there are frequent holy Meditations on him day and night. As Solomon exhorts, Prov.23.17. <HI>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</HI> Set God before thine eyes; wherever thou comest think of him, from morning unto night, ever and anon, let there be awfull holy thoughts in thy heart con∣cerning the Omnipresence of God. And this is to Remember him. We come therefore to the second thing to be enquired into, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Quest.2. <HI>How it doth appear that Young men ought to remember God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The Lord doth require this, the command∣ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith expresly. Luk. 10. 27. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.</HI> If men are bound to serve God with their strength, then they must not forget him, untill those dayes are come wherein their strength is gone, and they able to doe him little service. Of old, God required that the first born and the first fruits should be given to him. Exod.22.29. <HI>thou shalt not delay to

offer the first of thy ripe fruit, the first born shalt thou give unto me.</HI> This did intimate that men ought to give the prime of their Age, the first and best of their strength unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Truth of this Doctrine is evident, in that Parents are bound to teach their Children the fear of the Lord whilst they are young, Deut.6▪6,7. <HI>The words which I command thee, thou shalt teach them dili∣gently unto thy Children.</HI> Again, it is said, <HI>Train up a Child in the way be should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it,</HI> Prov.22.6. To the same purpose is that of the Apostle, Eph.6.4. <HI>Ye Fathers bring up your Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI> And according unto this hath been the practice of Saints. The Lord himself doth testify concerning Abraham, that he would <HI>command his Children to keep the wayes of the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18. 19. And Solomon doth acknowledge that his Father David was careful to in∣struct him, and put him in mind of God, whilst he was yet in the dayes of his Youth, Prov.4.3,4. <HI>I was my Fathers Son, he taught me, and said unto me, let thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heart retain my words.</HI> Yea, not only his Father, but his Mother also taught him the fear of the Lord, Prov.31.1,2. <HI>The words of King Lemuel, the Prophes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that his Mother taught him, what my Son! and what the Son of my womb! and what the Son of my voms!</HI> Now to what end were it, to teach Children and young ones to fear the Lord, if they were not bound to learn and do accordingly.</P>

Now that one consideration hath great weight in it, to enforce duty and obedience. For certainly, all owe service unto him, from whom they have receiv∣ed their Beings, Psal.95.6. <HI>O come let us worship and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, let us k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> He

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath made all for himself: from him and for him are all things. He as Creator hath given unto men rea∣sonable Souls, in respect whereof, they are capable of knowing and serving the Lord: and he is able to destroy them: He that made them can destroy them: as it is said concerning that creature, <HI>He that made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, can cause his sword to approach unto him,</HI> Job 40. 19 Therefore it concerns men to fear their Creator.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the third Particular, namely,</P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>Why Young men especially ought to remember their Cre∣ator?</HI></P>
<P>For these amongst other Reasons,</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because youth is the fittest season to remember God in, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eas.I.</NOTE> wherefore it is added in the Context, <HI>before the evil dayes come, when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them.</HI> Old age is an evil time: and therefore (saith the wise man) thou must Remember and serve God in thy good dayes, if thou wouldest have him to re∣member and accept of thee in thy evil dayes: if thon neglectest God in the spring of thy years, what rea∣son is there to think that he will regard thee when winter Age is come upon thee? Moreover, it is not easy to Turn unto the Lord in old age: A young plant is more easily plucked up then an old tree; so are young men with less difficulty transplanted, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ucked up out of the Soyl of nature, then they that are grown old in the wayes of sin. Old Diseases are hardly cured: so when men by a long continuance in a course of sin, have contracted almost incurable ha∣bits of sin, how hard a work will it be to convert them? were it not that all things with God are possi∣ble, it could not be. Wherefore the Scripture saith, <HI>can the AEthiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then may you also d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e good, that are accustomed to doe evil.</HI> Jer. 13.23. When Satan hath hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possessi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a long-time, it is not an easy work to out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and
<PB N="101" REF="000274_0107_0FA4586D2CEE6548"/>
disposses him. We read of one in the Gospel that had a most terrible dispossession, Mark 9.25,26. <HI>Jesus re∣buked the foul spirit, saying, I charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him: and the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him, and he was as one dead, in∣somuch that many said, he is dead.</HI> How difficult and how painfull was this Dispossession? Why? v.21. It is noted that the Father of that young man being en∣quired of, how long he had been in that condition, he said, <HI>Of a child.</HI> Truly, they that spend their childhood in the Service of Satan, if ever they be converted, are wont to have dreadfull Conversions at last. Therefore Young men should turn to God betimes, that so they may escape those bitter pangs, which otherwise they must expect to undergoe if e∣ver good come of them.</P>
<P>From the good and benefit which doth follow up∣on Remembring and Turning to God betimes: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reas.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> as it is said, Lam.3.27. <HI>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his Youth:</HI> so it is good for a man to turn to God, and to put his neck under his yoke in his Youth. It was the Saying of one, that <HI>if it were lawfull fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him to envy the happiness of any, he would envy the happiness of those that turn to God betimes,</HI> because they are freed from a world of sin and sorrow, which otherwise they would become subject unto. And this is the way to become eminent for God. There is a wretched Proverb in the world, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That a young Saint will prove an old Devill.</HI> I remem∣ber <NOTE N="[c]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Inpietate Juven.

The most eminent Saints that we read of there, were such as did Remember God in the dayes of their Youth. As now, Joseph proved an eminent good man: There
<PB N="102" REF="000274_0108_0FA4586EBB1DBE48"/>
is reason to think that all Jacobs Children were good men before they dyed, but none of them to be com∣pared with Joseph: and though he were the young∣est but one, yet it seemeth evident that he was con∣verted before any of his Brethren who were older then he. Job was an eminent Saint, not a man up∣on the face of the whole earth so good as he; and Job was one that made Conscience of his wayes even from his Youth. Job 31.18. David was a man that at∣tained a great measure of Grace before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dyed, and he was godly even from his Childhood. Therefore doth he speak as in Psal.71.5. <HI>Thou art my hope O Lord God, thou art my trust from my youth.</HI> &amp; again, v.17. <HI>O God thou hast taught me from my Youth &amp; hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</HI> So that David had Faith in Christ, and was savingly taught of God even from his Youth. Obadiah was an eminent Servant of God, and he could say, <HI>I fear the Lord from my Youth.</HI> 1.King.18.22. Josiah was eminent for God, and of him we read, that <HI>while he was young he began to seek after the Lord God of David his Father.</HI> He was truely converted when he was but sixteen years old.2.Chr.34.3. Timothy was an eminent Minister, &amp; (as Eccle∣siastical Story reports) at last he dyed a Martyr of Jesus Christ; now he was savingly acquainted with the holy Scriptures <HI>[apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rephous] from a little child.</HI> 2.Tim.3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. Thus we s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e how God hath owned and blessed those that have Remembred their Creator in the dayes of their Youth. And for that Reason Young men should Remember God.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 3. Young men are subject to the stroke of Death as well as others, Job.21.23. <HI>One dyeth in his full stren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th.</HI> The young man of Naim whom Christ restored to life; notwithstanding his Youth, was subject to the stroke of Death, Luk.7.14.

and yet he fell down from an upper Chamber, and was taken up dead, Act.20.9. were not Jobs Chil∣dren young men? and yet they dyed suddenly. Was not Absalom a young man, and his brother Adoni∣jah a young man when death surprized them? Did not Ely's Sons dye in the flower of their Age? 1 Sam.2.33. Now if young men Remember their Creator so as to repent of sin, and make sure of an Interest in Christ before death cometh, then happy shall they be. As Jeroboams good Son, though he were a child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dyed; 1 King.14.17. but inasmuch as in him there was found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel, death did him no hurt, only he was taken a∣way from the evil to come, that his eyes might not behold the miserable ruine, that was coming upon his Fathers Family.

If these golden dayes be lost, probably thou wilt be undone for ever. I must needs tell you, that for the most part it is so, that men are either converted in youth or not at all. We read but of one that was called at the eleventh hour. If a Tree do not blossome in the Spring▪ it is commonly dead all the year after.

Thomas Savage, who was executed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Ratcliff D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.28. 1668.</HI></NOTE> (whom many of you have heard of) that came to an untimely end, and that sin of Sabbath breaking made way to his ruine: when he should have been hearing the word on the Lords day, he would rather go to wicked houses; that at last, God was so provoked with him, as to leave him to commit a Capital sin upon the Sabbath day, for which he was brought to deserved executi∣on. And when in Prison, he said to some that came to visit him, <HI>O Wretch that I was! I studied how I might spend the Lords day in the Devills work: that time which I should have served God in, I did most for Satan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it: O</HI> (said he) <HI>tell young men from me, that the break∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g of the Sabbath is a dangerous and costly sin.</HI> And therefore young men beware of that sin. Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy, or you will never Re∣member your Creator as you ought to doe.</P>
<P>Once more: Sinfull Company keeping is an evill that young men are apt to be drawn away from God their Creator by. Many an hopefull young man, that hath been well instructed, that hath had great con∣victions upon his spirit, and friends that wished him him well, have been comforted in him; yet hath af∣terwards fallen in with bad Company, and that hath proved the eternal ruine of his Soul. I have known young men that upon sick-beds, and death-beds, have
<PB N="111" REF="000274_0117_0FA458786ED37510"/>
made lamentable cryes, <HI>O my sinfull Company keeping hath undone me for ever!</HI> Therefore let young men remember what the Scripture speaketh to them, <HI>My son if sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s intice thee consent thou not▪ Walk not thou in way of them, refrain thy foot from their path,</HI> Prov.1.10.15. Again, <HI>He that walketh with the wise shall be wise▪ but a Companion of Fools shall be destroyed,</HI> Prov.13.20. Young man, wouldest thou not be destroyed? then be not a Companion of Fools. Remember also what David faith, and follow his example, Psal.26.4,5,9. <HI>I have not sate with vain persons. I have hated the Con∣gregation of evill doers, and will not sit with the wicked. Gather not my Soul with Sinners.</HI> When thou dyest, thou would'st not have thy soul to be gathered to the place where sinners must be for ever▪ then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it not with them, hold not familiarity with them now: For they that are thy Companions and Familiars here, are like to be so to eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hearken to good Instruction.</HI> In the holy Scrip∣tures God himself instructs you. And therefore let young ones be diligent in reading the Scripture, that is the way to become like unto Timothy, to whom it was said, from a Child thou hast known the holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣to Salvation, through the Faith that is in Christ Je∣sus, 2 Tim.3.15. And when David had propounded that Question, <HI>wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?</HI> the Answer given is, <HI>by taking heed thereto ac∣cording to thy Word,</HI> Psal.119.9. For the most part it is so, that the wayes of young men need much clean∣sing. Youth is commonly the unclean part of a mans Age, but those young men that will make conscience to order their wayes and walkings according to the Word of God, shall thereby be cleansed. And, the Word preached, and publickly dispensed, is a means appointed by the Lord for the instruction of young
<PB N="112" REF="000274_0118_0FA45879412AA138"/>
ones, that they may learn the fear of God, Deut. 31▪12,13. <HI>Gather the People together, men and women, and Children, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and that their Children which have not known any thing may learn to fear the Lord.</HI> And therefore mind seriously what the Ministers of God speak in his Name. Mind it young men, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t you mourn at last, and say, How have I hated Instruction, and have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine Ear to them that instructed me! Yea, and hearken to the good Instructions which you re∣ceive from those whom God hath set over you. Have you not Masters, Fathers, Mothers, that admonish you and give you good counsel from day to day! de∣spise them not. Doth not the Scripture say to you, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear ye Children the Instruction of a Father,</HI> Prov.4.1. And again, <HI>My Son hear the Instruction of thy Father and forsake not the Law of thy Mother,</HI> Chap.1.18.▪ Eternal woe is like to be the portion of those Chil∣dren that regard not what Father and Mother say to them: Remember Eli his Sons; they were proud and head-strong; their Father reproved them, and exhorted them to amend their wayes, it is said, <HI>Not∣withstanding they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earkned not to the voice of their Father because the Lord would slay them.</HI> 1.Sam.2▪25. Art thou the young man that wilt not hearken to the voice of thy Father when he giveth thee good Counsel? This is a sign that <HI>the Lord will slay thee:</HI> a sad sign that thou art appointed to some terrible destruction at the last.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Remember those things which if duly thought on, may cause you to Remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth.</HI> e.g. Think sadly of the preciousness of Time, that so you may pass the time of your sojourn∣ing here in fear. You Young men, are exceeding apt to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pend precious hours, nay dayes in sin and
<PB N="113" REF="000274_0119_0FA45879EF286B10"/>
vanity, but it is because you do not consider how precious time is. Are not some that were once your companions in sin, dead, and (as there is cause to fear) dropped down into Hell? They would give Worlds (were it in their power) to enjoy that preci∣ous time, that is lost &amp; can never be regained. Shortly your time to remember your Creator in, will be past and gone forever. Remember also the worth of your own souls, what shall a man give in Exchange for his Soul? If he should gain the whole world,&amp;loose his own Soul, what is he profited? young men &amp; children, do you think of this! As young as you are, you have immortal Souls that must be either saved or damned, that when once you are dead, your Souls must go to be either in Heaven or Hell to all Eternity. And remember Death, which may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on you, ere you bé aware of it. Thou knowest not but that this night thy Soul may be taken from thee. It hath been tru∣ly said, <NOTE N="[h]" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aqu∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></NOTE> <HI>An old man hath death before his face, but in young man hath death behind his back,</HI> that may over∣take him before he thinks of any such thing. Chil∣dren may dye as well as others, Rev.2.23. <HI>I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Children with Death.</HI> I remember I have somewhere read, of a serious godly child, that would not speak vain words like other Children, but was careful to improve his time well, and being asked the Reason of his seriousness, O (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith he) I remember that I must dye. When some replyed to him, you are young▪ and may live many a fair day, what should you think of Death for? <HI>nay</HI> (said he) <HI>I was in the burying place,&amp; there I saw a grave, that was shorter then I am.</HI> So Chil∣dren, look into the burying place, and there you will see graves that are shorter then you are; there you will see that those that have been as young as you are, and younger too, have dyed and been put into their graves, and therefore it may be so with you.
<PB N="114" REF="000274_0120_0FA4587B13BEF650"/>
O then Remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth. And remember the day of Judgement. As Solomon in this Context <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, <HI>Know O young man; that God will bring thee to Judgement.</HI> Young men are apt to put the thoughts of death and Judgement far away, and therefore they remember not their Cre∣ator. Think with thy self, I must stand before Jesus Christ the Son of God at the great day; and what shall I then say to him? and what will the Lord in that day say unto me? will he say, come thou blessed? or will he not say to me, depart thou cursed.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Look unto Jesus Christ.</HI> O betake your selves to him. He calls from Heaven unto you young me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and children, that are here before the Lord this day, goe to him by Prayer, and to God by him. Some of you, when you are asked that Question, <HI>do you pray,</HI> Answer, I cannot pray. You would do it, you say, but you know not how to pray. Why, get into a secret place, and there lift up thine Eyes and heart to the Lord Jesus, and if thou can'st say nothing else, yet say, <HI>O thou Son of God have mercy on me! O convert me, and save my poor Soul!</HI> who knoweth but the Lord from on high, may look upon thee, since the Lord Je∣sus himself hath said, <HI>They that seek me early shall find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</HI></P>
