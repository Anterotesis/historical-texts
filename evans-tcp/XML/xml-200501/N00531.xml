<P><HI>SO Odious and Abominable is the name of a Witch, to the Civilized, much more the Religious part of Mankind, that it is apt to grow up into a Scandal for any, so much as to enter some sober cautions against the over hasty suspecting, or too precipitant Judging of Persons on this account. But certainly, the more execrable the Crime is, the more Critical care is to be used in the exposing of the Names, Liberties, and Lives of men (especially of a Godly Conversation) to the imputation of it. The aw∣ful hand of God now upon us, in letting loose of evil Angels among us to perpetrate such horrid Mischiefs; and suffering of Hells instruments, to do such fearfull things as have bin scarce heard of; hath put serious persons into deep Musings, and upon curious enquiries what is to be done for the detecting and defeating of this tremendous design of the grand Adversary: and, though all that fear God are agreed,</HI> That no evil is to be done, that Good may come of it; <HI>yet hath the Devil obtained not a little of his design, in the divisions of Reuben, about the application of this Rule.</HI></P>

enemies of Mankind, and set upon mischief, is not to be doubted: That the Devil can (by Divine per∣mission) and often doth vex men in Body and Estate, without the Instrumentality of Witches, is undeniable: That he often hath, and delights to have the Concurrence of Witches, and their consent in harming men, is con∣sonant to his Native Malice to man, and too La∣mentably exemplified: That Witches, when detected &amp; convinced, ought to be exterminated and cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we have Gods warrant for;</HI> Exod. 22. 18. <HI>Only the same God who hath said,</HI> thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live; <HI>hath also said,</HI> at the Mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of Death, be put to Death: but at the Mouth of one witness, he shall not be put to Death. Deut. 17. 6. <HI>Much debate is made about</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <HI>sufficient Conviction, and some have (in their Zeal) supposed that a less clear evidence ought to pass in this than in other cases, supposing that else it will be hard (if possible) to bring such to Condign Punishment, by Reason of the close Conveyances that there are between the Devil and Witches: but this is a very dangerous, and unjustifiable tenet. Men serve God in doing their Duty: he never intended that all Persons Guilty of Capital Crimes should be discovered and Punished by men in this Life, though they be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so curious in searching after iniquity. It is there∣fore exceeding necessary that in such a day as this men be informed what is evidence, and what is not. It concerns men in point of Charity; for, though the most shining Professor may be secretly a most abomi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able

sinner, yet till he be detected, our Charity is bound to Judge according to what appears: and not∣withstanding that a cleer evidence must determine a case; yet Presumptions must and ought to be weighed against presumptions, and Charity is not to be forgone as long as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath the most preponderating on its side. And it is of no less necessity in point of Justice; There are not only Testimonies required by God, which are to be Credited according to the Rules given in His Word referring to witnesses: but there is also an Evidence supposed to be in the Testimony, which is throughly to be weighed, and if it do not infallibly prove the crime against the person accused, it ought not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o determine him guilty of it; for so a righteous man may be Condemned unjustly. In the case of Witchcraft we know that the Devil is the immediate Agent in the Mischeif done, the consent or compact of the Witch is the thing to be Demonstrated.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Among many Arguments to evince this, that which is most under present debate, is that which refers to something Vulgarly, called</HI> Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctre Evidence, <HI>and a certain sort of</HI> Ordeal <HI>or trial by the sight and touch. The Principal plea to justify the convictive e∣vidence in these, is fetc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t from the Consideration of the Wisdom and Righteousness of God in Governing the World, which they suppose would fail, if such things were permitted to befal an Innocent person: but it is certain, that too resolute conclusions drawn from hence, are bold usurpations upon spotless</HI> Sovereignty; <HI>and though, some things, if suffered to be common, would subvert this Government, and disband, yea ruine H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mane

society; yet God doth sometimes suffer such things to evene, that we may thereby know how much we are beholden to Him, for that restraint which he Layes upon the infernal Spirits, who would else reduce a World into a Chaos. That the Resolutions of such Cases as these is proper for the Servants of Christ in the Ministry can∣not be denyed;</HI> The <HI>seasonableness of doing it now, will be Justified by the Consideration of the necessity there is at this time of a right information of mens Judgments about these things, and the danger of their being misinformed.</HI></P>
<P>T<HI>he Reverend, Learned, and Judicious Author of the ensuing Cases, is too well known to need our Commen∣dation: all that we are concerned in, is to</HI> assert our hearty Consent to, and Concurrence with the substance of what is conteined in the following Discourse: <HI>and, with our hearty Requests to God, that He would discover the depths of this Hellish Design; di∣rect in the whole Management of this affair; prevent the taking any wrong steps in this dark way; and that He would in particular Bless these faithful en∣deavours of His Servant to that end, we Commend it and you to His Divine Benediction.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Cases of Conscience Concerning Witchcrafts.</HEAD>
<P>THE First Case that I am desired to express my Judgment in, is this, <HI>Whether it is not Possible for the De∣vil to impose on the Imaginations of Persons Bewitched, and to cause them to Believe that an Innocent, yea that a Pious person do's torment them, when the Devil himself doth it, or whether Satan may not appear in the Shape of an Innocent and Pious, as well as of a Nocent and Wicked Person to Afflict such as suffer by Diabolical Molestations?</HI></P>
<P>The Answer to the Question must be Affir∣mative; Let the following Arguments be duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000658_0007_0FA9A227D7971BB8"/><HI>Argu.</HI> 1. There are several Scriptures from which we may infer the Possibility of what is Affirmed.</P>
<P N="1">1. We find that the <HI>Devil by the Instigation of the Witch at Endor appeared in the Likeness of the Prophet Samuel.</HI> I am not Ignorant that some have asserted that, which, if it were proved would e∣vert this Argument, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> that it was the true and not a delusive Samuel which the Witch brought to converse with Saul.

The Devil would be Worshipped as a God, and Saul now, that he was become a <HI>Necromancer,</HI> must bow himself to him. Moreover, had it bin the true Samuel from

Heaven reprehending <HI>Saul,</HI> there is great Reason to believe that he would not. only have reproved him for his sin, in not executing Judgment on the <HI>Amalekites;</HI> as in Ver. 18. But for his wickedness in consulting with Familiar Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its: for which Sin it was in special that he Dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. 2.

But in as much as there is not one word to Testi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y against that Abomination, we may conclude that it was not Real <HI>Samuel</HI> that appeared to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul.</HI> And if it were the <HI>D</HI>evil in his likeness the Argument seems very strong, that if the Devil, may appear in the Form of a Saint in Glory, much more is it pos∣sible for him, to put on the Likeness, of the most Pious and innocent Saint on Earth. There are, who acknowledge that a Daemon may appear in the Shape of a Godly Person, <HI>But not as doing Evil.</HI> Whereas the Devil in Samuels likeness told a Per∣nici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Lye, when he said <HI>Thou hast Disquieted me.</HI> It was not in the Power of Saul, nor of all the De∣vils in Hell, to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiet a Soul in Heaven, where Sa∣muel had been for Two years before this Appariti∣on. Nor did the <HI>Spectre</HI> speak true, when he said, <HI>Thou and thy Sons shall be with me;</HI> tho' Saul himself at his Death went to be with the Devil, his Son Jo∣nathan did not so. Besides, (which suits with the matter in hand) the <HI>D</HI>evil in Samuels shape confir∣med Necromancy and cursed Witchery. He that can in the likeness of Saints encourage Witches to Familiarity with Hell, may possibly in the Likene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ofa Saint afflict a Bewitched Person. But this we see from Scripture, Satan may be Permitted to do.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000658_0009_0FA9A22AAFD915A0"/>And whereas it is objected, that the Devil may appear indeed in the Form of Dead Persons, but that he cannot represent such as are living; The Cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is manifest. No Question had Saul said to the Witch, bring me David who was then living, she could as easily have shown living David as dead Samuel, as easily as that great Conjurer, of whom <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Daemo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ni.

<P>And that evil Angels have sometimes appeared in the likeness of living absent persons is a thing abun∣dantly confirmed by History.</P>

It remains then that such <HI>spectres</HI> are Prodigious &amp; Supernatural, &amp; not with∣out Diabolical Operation. It has been Controver∣ted among Learned men, whether innocent persons may not by the malice and deluding Power of the Devil be represented as present amongst witches at their dark Assemblies. The mentioned <HI>Thyreus</HI> sayes that the Devil may and often does represent the Forms of innocent persons out of those Con∣ventions, and that there is no Question to be made of it, but as to his natural Power and Art he is able to make their shapes appear amongst his own ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ants, but he suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth the Providence of God will not suffer such an Injury to be done to an Innocent Person.

when they were really at home and asleep, is men∣tioned by many Authors. But the Particulars in∣sisted on, do sufficiently evince the truth of what we assert, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the Devil may by Divne Permission appear in the shape of Innocent and Pious Persons. Neverthelesse, it is evident from another Scripture, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that in, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 11. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>For Satan himself is trans∣formed into an Angel of Light.</HI> He seems to be what he is not, and makes others seem to be what they are not. He represents evil men as good, &amp; good men as evil. The Angels of Heaven (who are the Angels of Light) love truth and Righteousness, the Devil will seem to do so to. And does therefore sometimes lay before men excellent good principles and exhort them (as he did <HI>Theodore maill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI>) to practise many things, which by the Law of Righte∣ousness they are obliged unto, and hereby he does more effectually deceive. Is it not strange, that he has sometimes intimated to his most devoted ser∣vants, that if they would have familiar Conversa∣tion with him, they must be careful to keep them∣selves from enormous Sins, and pray constantly for Divine Protection? But so has he transfarmed him∣self into an Angel of Light, as <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">De secret is mag. p. 31. see also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vater de Spect.

Satans appeaing visibly to them, pretending to be a good Angel. And moreover, he may be said to transform himself into an <HI>Angel of Light</HI> because of his appearing in the Form of <HI>Holy Men</HI> who are <HI>the Children of Light,</HI> yea in the Shape and Habit of Eminent Ministers of God. So did he appear to Mr <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Colchester</HI> in the Likeness of Mr <HI>Liddal</HI> an Holy man of God and to the Turkish Chaous Baptized at <HI>London</HI> Anno 1658 pretending to be Mr <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> an excellent Minister of Christ. And how of∣ten has he pretended to be the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> Or <HI>Peter</HI> or some other celebrated Saint? Ecclesiastical His∣tories abound with Instances of this nature. Yea, sometimes he has transfigured himself into the Form of Christ. It is reported that he appeared to <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Sulpitius severus in vita martini.</NOTE> St <HI>Martin</HI> Gloriously arrayed as if he had been Christ. So likewise to <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Guac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius compend: mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic p. 342.</NOTE> <HI>Second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and to another Saint, who suspecting it was Satan, transforming himself into an Angel of Light had this expression, <HI>If I may see Christ in Heaven it is enough, I desire not to see him in this world,</HI> whereupon the <HI>spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> vanished. It has been related of <HI>Luther,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat after he had been Fasting and Praying in his Study, the Devil comes pretending to be Christ, but <HI>Luther</HI> saying, <HI>away thou confounded Devil, I acknowledg no Christ but what is in my Bible,</HI> nothing more was seen.

<PB N="9" REF="000658_0014_0FA9A22E72A70E68"/>
Near that place a number of Protestants were wont to meet to serve God. Whence the Professors of the true Reformed Religion were nick-named <HI>Hugo∣nots</HI> by the Papists, who designed to render them before the world as the servants and worshippers of that <HI>Demon,</HI> that went under the name of <HI>Hugon.</HI> And how often have I read in Books written by Jesuits, that <HI>Luther</HI> was a Wizza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, &amp; that he did himself confess that he had Familiarity with Satan! Most impudent Untruths! nor are these things to be wondered at, since the Holy Son of God himself was reputed a <HI>Magician,</HI> and one that had Familiari∣ty with the greatest of Devils. The Blaspheming Pharisees said, <HI>He casts out the Devils thro' the Prince of Devils.</HI> Math. 9. 34. There is then not the best Saint on Earth (Man or Woman) that can assure themselves that the Devil shall not cast such an Imputation upon them. <HI>It is enough for the Dis∣ciple that he be as his Master, and the Servant as his Lord: If they have called the Master of the House Beelzebub, how much more them of His Houshold.</HI> Math. 10. 25. It is not for men to determine how far the Holy God may permit the wicked one to pro∣ceed in his Accusations. The sacred story of Job. giveth us to understand that the Lord whose wayes are past finding out, do's for Wise and Holy Ends suffer Satan, by immediate Operation, (and con∣sequently by Witchcraft) greatly to afflict innocent persons, as in their Bodies and Estates, so in their Reputations. I shall mention but one Scripture more to confirm the Truth in hand. It is that in,
<PB N="10" REF="000658_0015_0FA9A22F32A149D8"/>
Eccles. 9. 2, 3. Where it is said, <HI>All things come a∣like to all, there is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked, as is the Good, so is the sin∣ner, this is an evil amongst all things under the Sun that there is one Event happenet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to all.</HI> And in Eccles. 7. 15. tis said, <HI>There is a just man that perisheth in his Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we inferr that there is no outward Affliction whatsoever but may befal a Good Man; now to be represented by Satan as a Tormentor of Bewitched or Possessed Persons, is a sore affliction to a Good man. To be Tormented by Satan is a sore Affliction, yet nothing but what befel Job, and a Daughter of Abraham whom we read of in the Gospel. To be represented by Satan, as tormenting others, is an affliction like the former. The Lord may bring such extraordinary Temptations on his own Children, to Afflict and Humble them, for some sin they have been guilty of before him. A most wicked Person in St. <HI>Ives,</HI> got a Knife, and went with it to a Ministers House; designing to stab him, but was disappointed. Afterwards Con∣science being awakened, the Devil appears to this Person in the Shape of that Minister, with a Knife in his hand exhorting to Self-murder. Was not here a punishment suitable to the sin which that Person had been Guilty of? Perhaps some of those, whom Satan has represented as committing Witchcrafts, have been tampering with some foolish and Wick∣ed Sorceries, tho' not to that degree, which is Cri∣minal and Capital by the Laws both of God, and

Men; for this Satan may be permitted so to scourge them. Or, it may be they have misrepresented &amp; abused others, for which cause the Holy God may justly give Satan leave, fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely to represent them.</P>

An eminent Person still living had the account of this matter from Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> (the famous Teacher of both <HI>Bostons</HI>). He
<PB N="13" REF="000658_0018_0FA9A23225A6AC00"/>
was well acquainted with that Minister, who rela∣ted to him the whole Story with all the Circum∣stances of it. For Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was so affected with the Report, as to take a Journey on purpose to the Town where this happened, that so he might obtain a satisfactory Account about it, which he did. Some Authors say that a <HI>Demon</HI> appeared in the Form of <HI>Sylvanus</HI> (<HI>Hiero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s</HI> Friend) attempting a dishonest thing, the Devil thereby designing to blast the Re∣putation of a famous Bishop. I have in another Book mentioned that celebrated Instance concern∣ing an honest Citizen in <HI>Zurick</HI> (the Metropolis of <HI>Heluetia</HI>) in whose Shape the Devil appeared com∣mitting an abominable Fact (not fit to be named) very early in the morning, seen by the Prefect of the City, and his Servant.

<P>Some Popish Authors argue, that that Devil can∣not personate an innocent man as doing an Act of witchcraft, because then he might as well represent them as commiting Theft, murder &amp;c. And if so, there would be no Living in the world. But I turn the Argument against them, He may (as the mentioned Instances prove) personate honest men as doing other Evils. And no solid Reason can be given why he may not as well personate them un∣der the notion of witches as under the notion of Thieves, Murders and Idolators. As for the Objecti∣on, that then there would be no living in the world, we shall consider it under the next Argument.</P>

He has likewise the Art of Limning in the Perfection of it, and knows what may be done by Colours. It is an odd Pas∣sage <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">6. Acta Eruditorum Anno, 1690. Pag. 113.</NOTE> which I find in the <HI>Acta Eruditorum</HI> Printed at Lip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick, that about 32 years ago an indigent Mer∣chant in <HI>France</HI> was instructed by a <HI>Doemon</HI> that with water of Borax he might colour Taffities, so as to cause them to glister and look very gay. He fearcheth into the Nature, Causes, and Reasons of things, whereby he is able to produce wonderful ef∣fects. So that if he does not form the Shape of an innocent person as afflicting others, it is not from want of either will or power. They that affirm that God never did nor ever will permit him thus to do, alledge that it is incon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stant with the Righte∣ousness and Providence of God in Governing Hu∣mane Affairs thus to suffer men to be imposed on. It must be acknowledged <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">In Mr. Glan∣vils Philosophical Considerations.</NOTE> that the Divine Pro∣vidence
<PB N="16" REF="000658_0021_0FA9A233AF7EDFE0"/>
has taken care that the greatest part of man∣kind shall not be left to unavoidable Deception, so as to be always abused by the mischievous Agents of Hell, in the objects of plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence. But yet it is not for sinful and silly Mortals to prescribe Rules to the Most High in his Government of the world, or to direct him how far he may permit Satan to use his power: I am apt to think that there are some amongst us, who if they had lived in <HI>Job's</HI> days, and seen the Devil tormenting of him, and heard him complaining of being fear'd with Dreams and terrified with Night-visions, they would have joined with his uncharitable friends in Censuring him as a most guilty person. But we should consi∣der that the Most High God do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h sometimes deal with men in a way of Absolute Soveraignty, per∣forming the thing which is appointed for them, and many such things are with him. If he does destroy the perfect with the wicked, and Laugh at the Trial of the innocent (Job 9. 22, 23.) who shall enter into His Counsels! who has given Him a Charge over the Earth. or who has disposed the whole world! men are not able to give an Account of his ordinary works much less of his secret Coun∣sels, and the Dark Dispensations of his Providence. They do but darken counsel by words without knowledge when they undertake it. If we are not able to see how this or that can stand with the Righteousness of him that Governs the world, shall wo say that the Almighty will pervert Judgment? or that he that Governs the Earth hateth Right?
<PB N="17" REF="000658_0022_0FA9A234726444C0"/>
shall we condemn him that is most just? But where∣as 'tis objected where is Providence? and how shall men live on the Earth, If the Devil may be per∣mitted to use such power? I demand, where was Providence, when Satan had Power to cause sons of Belial to lye and swear away the life of innocent <HI>Nab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,</HI> laying such Crimes to his charge as he was never guilty of? And what an hour of Darkness was it? How far was the power of Hell permitted to prevail, when Christ the Son of God was Accu∣sed▪ Condemned, and Hanged for a Crime that he never was guilty of? That was the strangest Provi▪dence that has happened since the world began, and yet in the Issue the most glorious. We must therefore distinguish between what does ordinarily come to pass by the Providence of God, and things which are extraordinary. It is not an usual thing for a <HI>Naboth</HI> to have his life taken from him by false Accusations, or for an <HI>Athanasi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> or a <HI>Susann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to be Charged, and perhaps brought before Courts of Judicature for Crimes of which they were alto∣gether Innocent.</P>
<P>But if we therefore conclude that such a thing as this can never happen in the World, we shall of∣fend against the Generation of the just. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not ordinary for Devils to be permitted to reveal the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—sins of men; yet this ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been done more than once or twice.

It is not usual for Providence to permit the Devil to come from Hell and to throw Fire on the Tops of Houses, and to cause a whole Town to be burnt to Ashes thereby. There would (it must be confessed) be no living in the world if Evil-An∣gels should be permitted to do thus when they had a mind to it. Neverthless, Authors worthy of Cre∣dit, tell us that this has sometimes happened. <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">De s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btilita te Lib. 19.</NOTE> Both <HI>Erasmus</HI> and <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us</HI> write that the Town of <HI>Schiltach</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> was in the Month of April, 1533.

The poor Man to satisfy his Neighbours, who were ready to Stone him, carried an hot Iron in his hand, but receiving no hurt thereby, he was judged to be innocent. It is not ordinary for a Devil upon the Dying Curse of a Servant, to have a Commission from Heaven to tear and torment a bloody cruel master; yet such a thing may possibly come to pass. There is a fearful Story to this purpose in the Account of the <HI>Bucaneers</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">p. 75, 76.</NOTE> wherein my Author relates that a Servant, who was <HI>Spirited</HI> or <HI>Kidnapt</HI> (as they call it) Into <HI>America,</HI> falling into the Hands of a Tyrannical Master, he ran away from

But of this Tragical Story enough.</P>
<P>To proceed, Is it not usual for Persons after their Death to appear unto the Living. But it do's not therefore follow, that the Great God will not suffer this to be. For both in former and latter A∣ges, Examples thereof have not been wanting. No longer since, than the last Winter, there was much Discourse in <HI>London</HI> concerning a Gentlewoman, unto whom her Dead Son (and another whom she knew not) had appeared. Being then in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> I was willing to satisfy my self, by enquiring into the Truth of what was reported. And on <HI>Feb.</HI> 23. 1691. my Brother (who is now a Pastor

She told us, that a Son of hers, who had been a very civil young man, but more airy in his Temper than was plea∣sing to his serious Mother, being <HI>D</HI>ead, she was much concerned in her Thoughts about his Con∣dition in the other World. But a Fortnight after his Death, he Appeared to her, saying, <HI>Mother, you are solicitous about my eternal Welfare. Trouble your self no more, for I am happy,</HI> and so vanished. Should there be a continual Intercourse between the Visible and the Invisible World, it would breed Confusion. But from thence to inferr, that the Great Ruler of the Universe will never permit any thing of this nature to be, is an inconsequent Conclusion. It is not usual for Devils to be per∣mitted to come and violently carry away persons through the Air, several Miles from their Habitati∣ons. Nevertheless, this was done in <HI>Sweedland</HI> a∣bout Twenty Years ago, by means of a cursed Knot of Witches there. And a Learned Physici∣an now living, giveth an Account of several Chil∣dren, who by Diabolical Frauds were Stollen from their Parents, and others left in their room: And of two, that in the night-time a Line was by In∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hands put about their necks, with which they had been Strangled, but that some near them happily prevented it. <HI>V.

Men doing an ill thing, but Providence has found out some way for their vindication; Either they have been able to prove that they were in another Place when that Fact was done, or the like. So that perhaps there never was an Instance of any Innocent Person Condemned in any Court of Judicature on Earth, only through Satans deluding and imposing on the Imaginations of men, when nevertheless, the Witnesses, Juries, and Judges were all to be excused from blame.</P>

(<HI>Wiechard Valvassor</HI>) relates that a Venetian Jew instructed him (only he would not attend his <HI>I</HI>nstructions) how to make a Magical Glass which should represent any person or thing ac∣cording as he should desire. If a Magician by an Inchanted Glass can do this, he may as well by the help of a Daemon cause false <HI>Idoeas</HI> of Persons and Things to be Impressed on the I∣maginations of bewitched Persons. The Blood and Spirits of a Man, that is bitten with a Mad∣<HI>D</HI>ogg, are so envenomed, as that strange Im∣pressions are thereby made on his Imagination. <HI>L</HI>et him be brought into a Room where there is a Looking-Glass, and he will (if put upon it) not only say but swear that he sees a <HI>D</HI>og tho' in truth there is no <HI>D</HI>og it may be within 20 Miles of him.

I have heard of an Inchanted Pin, that has caused the Condemnation and <HI>D</HI>eath of many scores of Innocent persons. There was a Noto∣rious <HI>Witchfinder</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that undertook by a Pin, to make an Infallible discovery of suspect∣ed persons, whether they were Witches or not If when the Pin was run an Inch or two into into the Body of the Accused party, no blood ap∣peared, nor any sense of Pain, then he declared them to be Witches. By means hereof my Au∣thor tells me no less then 300 persons were
<PB N="27" REF="000658_0032_0FA9A23CB1E08E00"/>
condemned for witches in that Kingdom. This Bloody Jugler after he had done enough in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> came to the Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed.</HI> An honest man now living in <HI>New-England</HI> assureth me that he saw the man thrust a great Bras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Pin two inches into the body of one that some would in that way try whether there was Witch∣craft in the case or no. The Accused Party was not in the least sensible of what was done, and therefore in danger of receiving the Punishment justly due for Witchcraft. Only it so happened, that Collonel <HI>Fenwick</HI> (that worthy Gentleman, who many years since lived in <HI>New England</HI>) was then the Military Governour in that Town. He sent for the Mayor and Magistrates, advising them to be careful and cautious in their Proceedings. For he told them, it might be an Inchanted Pin, which the Witch-finder made use of. Whereupon the Magistrates of the place ordered that he should make his Experiment with some other Pin as they should appoint: But that he would by no means be induced unto, which was a sufficient Discovery of the Knavery and Witchery of the Witch-finder. There is a strange Diabolical Energy goeth along with <HI>Incantations.</HI> If <HI>Balak</HI> had not known that, he would not have sent for <HI>Balaam</HI> to see whether he could Inchant the Children of <HI>Israel.</HI> The Scripture intimates that Inchantments will keep a Serpent from biting, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 10. 11.

thing with that Knife, it would dy immediately. And that there is a wonderful Power of the Devil attending things Inchanted, we have confirmed by a prodigious Instance in Major <HI>Weir</HI> a <HI>Scotch∣man.</HI> That wretched man was a perfect Prodigy.

This horrid Creature, if he had his <HI>Inchanted Staff</HI> in his hand, could pray to Admiration, and do extraordinary things, as is more amply related in the Postscript to Mr. <HI>Sin∣clares</HI> his Book before mentioned. But if he had not his Inchanted Rod to Lean upon, he could not transform himself into an Angel of Light. But by all these things we may conclude, that it is not impossible, but that a guilty Conjurer, that so he may render himself the less suspected, may by his Magical Art and Inchantment cause Innocent Per∣sons to be Represented as afflicting those whom the Devil and himself are the Tormentors of.</P>

<P>As for the Judgment of the Elders in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> so far as I can learn, they do generally con∣curr with Mr. <HI>Perkins,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bernard.</HI> This I know, that at a Meeting of Ministers at <HI>Cambridge, August</HI> 1. 1692. where were present seven Elders besides the President of the <HI>Colledge,</HI> the Question then discoursed on, was, <HI>Whether the Devil may not sometimes have a Permission to Represent an Innocent Person as tormenting such as are under Diabolical Mo∣lestations?</HI> The Answer which they all concurred in was in these words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That the Devil may sometimes have a Permission to Represent an Innocent Person as tormenting such as are under Diabolical Mo∣lestations. But that such things are rare and extraordi∣ry, especially when such Matters come before Civil Ju∣dicatures.</HI> And that some of the most Eminent Ministers in the Land, who were not at that Meeting, are of the same Judgment, I am assured. And I am also sure, that in Cases of this Nature, the Priests <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips should keep Knowledge, and they
<PB N="33" REF="000658_0038_0FA9A2413B247120"/>
should seek the Law at his Mouth, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2. 7.</P>
<P>Arg. 6. <HI>Our own Experience has confirmed the Truth of what we affirm.</HI></P>
<P>I have in another Book given an account concer∣ning <HI>Eliz. Knap,</HI> of <HI>Groton,</HI> who complained that a Woman as eminent for Piety, as any in that Town, did appear to her, and afflict her. But afterwards she was satisfied that that person never did her any harm, but that the Devil abused them both. A∣bout two years ago, a bewitched person in <HI>Chelms∣ford,</HI> in her Fitts, complained that a worthy good man a near relation of hers, did afflict her. <HI>S</HI>o did she likewise complain of another person in that Town, of known Integrity and Piety.</P>
<P>I have my self known several of whom I ought to think that they are now in Heaven, considering that they were of good Conversation, and reputed Pious by those that had the greatest Intimacy with them, of whom nevertheless, some complai∣ned that their Shapes appeared to them, and threat∣ned them. Nor is this answered by saying, we do not know but those persons might be Witches. We are bound by the Rule of Charity to think other∣wise. And they that censure any, meerly because much a sad Affliction as their being falsely represen∣ted by Satan, has befallen them, do not do as they would be done by. I bless the Lord, it was never the portion allotted to me, nor to any Relation of mine to be thus abused. But no man knoweth what may happen to him, since <HI>There be just Men
<PB N="34" REF="000658_0039_0FA9A241F2269B98"/>
unto whom it hapneth according to the work of the Wicked.</HI> Eccles. 8. 14. But what needs more to be said, since there is one amongst ourselves whom no man, that knows him, can think him to be a Wizzard, whom yet some bewitched per∣sons complained of, that they are in his Shape Tormented. And the Devils have of late, accused some Eminent Persons.</P>
<P>It is an awful thing which the Lord has done to convince some amongst us of their error. This then I Declare and Testify, that to take away the life of any one, meerly because a <HI>Spectre</HI> or Devil, in a Bewitched or Possessed person does accuse them, will bring the Guilt of Innocent Blood on the <HI>L</HI>and, where such a thing shall be done. Mercy forbid that it should, (and I trust that as it has not, it never will be so) in <HI>New-England.</HI> What does such an Evidence amount unto more then this. Either such an one did afflict such an one, or the Devil in his likeness, or his <HI>E</HI>yes were bewitched.</P>
<P>The things which have been mentioned make way for, and bring us unto the Second Case, which is to come under our Consideration,</P>
<P><ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>If one Bewitched is struck down at the Look or Cast of the Eye of another, and after that Recovered again by a Touch from the same Person, is not this an infallible Proof that the Person Suspected and Complained of is in League with the Devil?</HI></P>
<P>Answer; It must be owned that by such
<PB N="35" REF="000658_0040_0FA9A2438B4D2870"/>
things as these Witchcrafts and Witches have been discovered more then once or twice. And that an ill Fame or other Circumstances attending the suspected Party, this may be a ground for Exa∣mination; but this alone does not afford suffici∣ent matter for Conviction. As <HI>Spectres</HI> or Devils appearing in the Shapes of men that have been murdered, declaring that they were murdered by such persons and in such a Place, may give just Occasion to the Magistrate for Enquiry into the matter. One great Witch-Advocate <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Websters Displaying of supposed Witchcraft.

If the <HI>D</HI>evil by Divine Permis∣sion

may cause supernatural Concomitances and Consequences to attend the natural Actions of men without their Allowance, as is manifest in Possessed Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, how is it reasonable and just that the Impositions of the Devil should be imputed unto any man. And (saith he) God forbid that the Devils Signs and Won∣ders, nay his Truths should become auy legal Allegations or Evidences in Law. We may therefore conclude it unjust that the forenamed Miraculons Effect by the Devil wrought and imputed by the Bewitched, should be esteemed an infallible Mark against any man, as therefore convinced for that the <HI>D</HI>evil and the Bewitched have so dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phered him?</Q> Thus that Learned Man. But to the case in hand, I have several things to offer.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is possible that the Persons in Question may be Possessed with Cacodoemons.</HI> That be∣witched Persons are many times really possessed with evil Spirits, is most certain. And as Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> observes, no man can prove but that Witchcraft might be the cause of many of those Possessions, which we read of in the Gospel. And that Devils have been immitted into the Bodyes of miserable Creatures by Ma∣gicians and Witches, Histories and Experience do abundantly testify. <HI>Hierom</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In vita Hilarion</HI></NOTE> relates
<PB N="39" REF="000658_0044_0FA9A246717E45D8"/>
concerning a certain Virgin, that a young man, whose Amours she despised, prevailed with a Magician to send an evil Spirit into her, by means whereof she was strangly be∣forted. Tis reported <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anastasius Quest.</HI> 23.</NOTE> of <HI>Simon Magus</HI> that after he had used an Hellish Sacrifice, to be revenged of some that had called him a great Witch, he caused infernal Spirits to enter into them. Many confessing Witches have ac∣knowledged that they were the cause of such and such Persons being Possessed by evil An∣gels, as <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Disput.

Our Saviour by his own une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Example has taught us not to receive the Devils Testimony in any thing.

Another time when there was a talk of some Ministers of the reformed Religion, the Devils in the Obsessed laughed and said they were not at all afraid of them, for the <HI>Calvinists</HI> and they were very good Friends.

He mixeth Truths with Lies, that so those Truths giving Credit unto Lies, men may believe both, -and so be deceived. And whereas some say that the Persons in Question are only bewitched and not possessed, let it be Considered that possessed persons are called <HI>Energumens</HI> from EPJOMAI <HI>Agitor.</HI> They whose Bodys are Preternaturally agitated, so as to be in danger of being thrown into the Fire or into the Water, though they may be bewitched, are undoubtedly possessed with <HI>Doemons.</HI> Mark 9. 22, 25.

<P>For sometimes the Afflicted Person is made sick, (instead of being made whole) by the touch of the Accused. Sometimes the Power of Ima∣gination is such as that the Touch of a Person in∣nocent and not accused shall have the same effect. It is related in the Account of the Tryals of Witches at <HI>Bury</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI> 1664 during the time

<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"> <HI>See the Tryal, pag.</HI> 40. 43, 45.</NOTE> of the Tryal there were some Experiments made with the persons afflicted, by bringing the Accused to touch them, and it was observed that by the least Touch of one of the supposed Witch∣es, they that were in their Fitts, to all mens Ap∣prehension wholly deprived of all sense and un∣derstandings, would suddenly shriek out and open their hand.</P>
<P>Mr. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rjeant <HI>Keeling,</HI> did not think that suffi∣cient to Convict the Prisoners, for admitting that the Children were in Truth Bewitched, yet (saith he) it cannot be applyed to the Prisoners upon the Imagination only of the Parties Afflicted. For if that might be allowed, no Person whatsoever can be in safety, for perhaps they might fancy a∣nother Person who might altogether be innocent in such matters. To avoid this Scruple it was privately desired by the Judge, that some Gentle∣men there in Court, would attend one of the dist∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpered Persons in the farther part of the Hall, whilst she was in her Fitts, and then to send for one of the Witches to try what would happen, which they did accordingly. One of them was convey'd from the Barr, and brought to the Af∣flicted Maid. They put an Apron before her Eyes, and then another person (not the Witch) touched her, which produced the same Effect, as the Touch of the Witch did in the Court. Where∣upon

the Gentlemen returned much unsatisfyed. <HI>Bodin</HI> <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Doemon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mania.

That horrid Witch of <HI>Salisbury, Ann Bodenbam</HI> <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Printed Re∣lation page.</HI> 30, 31.</NOTE> who had been Servant to the Notorious Con∣jurer <HI>Dr. Lamb,</HI> could not bear the sight of one that was Bewitched by her. Assoon as e∣ver she saw the Afflicted Person, she ran about shrieking, and crying, and roaring, after an Hideous manner, that the Devil would Tear her in pieces, if that Person came near her. And whilst the Witch was in such Torment, the Bewitched was at case, By these things we see that the Laws and Customes of the King∣dome of Darkness are not always and in all places the same.</P>
<P>And it is good for men to concern them∣selves with them as little as may be.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="000658_0051_0FA9A24BB1392688"/>I think there is weight in Dr. <HI>Cotta's</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><HI>ubi supra pag.</HI> 121.</NOTE> Argument, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>That the Gift of healing the Sick and Possessed was a special Grace and Favour of God, for the Con∣firmation of the Truth of the Gospel, but that such a Gift should be annexed to the Tonch of Wicked Witches, as an infallible sign of their Guilt, is not easy to be believed.</HI> It is a thing well known, that if a Person possessed by an Evil Spirit, is (as oft it so happens) never so outragious whilst a good man is Praying with, and for the Afflicted, let him lay his hand on them, and the Evil Spirit is quiet. I hope this is no evidence of any Covenant, or vo∣luntary Communion between the Good man that is Praying and the Evil Spirit. No more does the Case before us, Evince any such thing.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There are that Question the Lawfulness of the Experiment.</HI> For it this healing power in the Witch is not a Divine but a Diabolical Gift, it may be dangerous to meddle too much with it. If the Witch may be ordered to Touch Afflicted Persons in order to their healing or recovery, out of a sick Fitt, why may not the Diseased person be as well ordered to Touch the Witch for the same cause? And if to touch him, why not to scratch him and fetch Blood out of him, which is but an harder kind of Touch? But as for this Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> doubts not to call it, a <HI>Practice of Witchcraft,</HI> It is not safe to meddle with any of the <HI>D</HI>evils Sacraments or Institutions. <HI>For My own part,</HI> I <HI>should be loath

to say to a man, that I knew or thought was a Witch, do you lock on such a Person, and see if you can Witch them into a Fitt. And there is such an Afflicted Person do you take them by the Hand, and see if you can Witch them well again. If it is by vertue of some Contract with the Devil, that Witches have power to do such things it is hard to conceive how they can be bid to do them, without being too much concerned in that Hellish Covenant.</HI> I take it to be (as elsewhere <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot"> <HI>Remarkable Providences. page</HI> 267.</NOTE> I have expressed) a solid Principle, which the Learned <HI>Sennertus</HI> insists on, <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> <HI>That they who force ano∣ther to do that which be cannot possibly do, but by vertue of a Compact with the Devil, have themselves implicit∣ly Communion, with the Diab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lical Covenant.</HI> The Devil is pleased and honoured, when any of his Institutions, are made use of. This way of dis∣covering Witches is no better than that of putting the Urine of the Afflicted Person into a Bottel that so the Witch may be Tormented, and <HI>D</HI>is∣covered.

It remains then that the casting down with the Look is no infallible sign of a Witch.</P>
<P N="7">7. It has always been said, that it is a difficult thing to find out Witches. But if the Represen∣tation of such a person as afflicting, or the Look or Touch be an infallible proof of the guilt of Witchcraft in the persons complained of, 'tis the easiest thing in the world to discover them.

<P>That some Persons at the sight of Bruit-Creatures Cats, Spiders, &amp;c.

<P>We proceed now to the third Case Proposed to Consideration, If the things which have been men∣tioned
<PB N="52" REF="000658_0057_0FA9A251C671FE70"/>
are not infallible Proofs of Guilt in the Accu∣sed party, it is then Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>Whether there are any Discoveries of this Crime, which Jurors and Judges may with a safe Conscience proceed upon to the Conviction and Condemnation of the Persons under Suspicion?</HI></P>
<P>Let me here premise two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The evidence in this Crime ought to be as clear as in any other Crimes of a Capital Nature. The word of God does no where intimate, that a less clear evidence, or that fewer or other witnes∣ses may be taken as sufficient to convict a man of Sorcery, which would not be enough to convict him were he charged with another evil worthy of Death. <HI>Numb;</HI> 35. 30. if we may not take the Oath of a distracted person or of a possessed person in a case of Murder, Theft, Felony of any sort, then neither may we do it in the Case of witchcraft.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me premise this also, that there have been wayes of trying witches long used in many Nations, Especially in the dark times of Paganism and Pope∣ty which the righteous God never approved of. But which as (judicious Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> expresseth it in plain English) were invented by the Devil, that so Innocent Persons might be condemned, and some notorious witches escape. Yea, many superstitions and Magical experiments have been used to try witches by. Of this sort is that of scratching the witch, or seething the urin of the Bewitched person, or making a witch-cake with that urine. And that Trial of putting their hands into scalding water, to see if it will not hurt them. And that of sticking an Awle under the seat of the suspected

party yea, and that way of discovering witches by tying thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hands and feet, and casting them on the water, to try whether they will sink or swim. I did publickly bear my Testimony against this supersti∣tion in a Book Printed at <HI>Boston</HI> Eight years past.</P>
<P>I hear that of late some in a Neighbour Colony have been playing with this diabolical invention. It is to be Lamented that in such a <HI>Land of upright∣ness</HI> as <HI>New-England</HI> once was, a practice which Pro∣testant writers generally condemn as sinful, and which the more sober and I earned men amongst Papists themselves have not only judged unlawful but (to express it in their owne Terms) to be no less than a <HI>Mortal Sin,</HI> should ever be heard of. Were it not that the Coming of Christ to Judge tee earth draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th near, I should think that such Practises are an unhappy omen that the Devil and Pagans will get these dark Territories into their Possession again. But that I may not be thought to have no Reason for my calling the impleaded Experiment into Question, I have these these things further to all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge against it.</P>

throughout Germany have disapproved of this way of Purgation.</P>
<P N="2">2 The Devil is in it.All Superstition is from him.And when secret things, or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atent</HI> Crimes, are discovered by Superstitious practices, some Compact and Com∣munion with the Devil is the Cause of it, as <HI>Austin</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">De Doctr: christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Lib. 2: Cap: 20. 22.</NOTE> has truly inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted. And so it is here. For if a Witch cannot be drowned, this must proceed either from some natural cause, which it doth not, for it is against nature for humane Bodies, when hands and feet are tyed, not to sink under the water Besides, they that plead for this superstition, say that if Witches happen to be Condemned for some o∣ther Crime and not for Witchcraft, they will not swim like a Cork above Water, which shew∣eth that the cause of this Natation is not <HI>Physical.</HI> And if not, then either it must proceed from a Di∣vine Miracle to save a Witch from Drowning; or lastly, it must be a Diabolical Wonder. This superstitious Experiment is commonly known by the Name of, <HI>The Vulgar Probation,</HI> because it was never appointed by any lawful Authority, but from the Suggestion of the <HI>D</HI>evil taken up by the rude Rabble. And some <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</NOTE> learned men are of O∣pinion, that the first <HI>Explorator (being a White Witch)</HI> did Explicity covenant with the <HI>D</HI>evil, that he should discover <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atent</HI> Crimes in this way: And that it is by vertue of that first Contract that the Devil goeth to work to keep his servants from sinking, when this Ceremony of his ordaining is used. Moreover, we know that <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bolus est Dei Simia,</HI> the Devil seeks to

This Miracle would the <HI>D</HI>evil imi∣tate in causing Witches, who are his Martyrs not to sink when they are cast into the Waters.</P>
<P N="3">3. This way of Purgation is of the same nature with the old <HI>Ordeals</HI> of the Pagans If men were accu∣sed with any crime, to clear their innocency they were to take an hot Iron into their hands, or to suffer sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lding water to be poured down their throats, &amp; if they received no hurt thereby they were acquit∣ted. This was the Devils invention, and many times (as the Devil Would have it) they that submitted to these Trials, suffered no Inconvenience. Ne∣vertheless, it is astonishing to think what inno∣cent Blood has been shed in the World by means of this <HI>Satanical</HI> Device. Witches have often (as <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">In ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eo malle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icarum. p. 421.</NOTE> <HI>Sprenger</HI> observes) desired that they might stand or fall by this Tryal by hot Iron, and sometimes come off well. Indeed, this Ordeal was used in other Cases and not in Cases of Witch∣craft only. And so was <HI>the Vulgar Probation</HI> by casting into the Water practiced upon persons ac∣cused <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de purgat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne vidgari—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p. nit.</NOTE> with other Crimes as well as that of Witchcraft. How it came to be restrained to that of Witchcraft, I cannot tell. It is as Supernatural for a Body whose hands and feet are tyed to Swim above the Water, as it is for their hands not to feel a red hot Iron. If the one of these <HI>Ordeals</HI> is law∣ful
<PB N="56" REF="000658_0061_0FA9A254B79975A0"/>
to be used, then so is the other too. But as for the fiery Ordeal it is rejected and exploded out of the World; for the same reason then the Tryal by Water should be so.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a Tempting of God when men put the Innocency of their Fellow-Creatures upon such Tryals. To desire the Almighty to shew a Mira∣cle to clear the Innocent, or to Convict the guil∣ty is a most Presumptuous Tempting of him. Was it not a Miracle when <HI>Peter</HI> was kept from Sinking under the Water by the Omnipotency of Christ. As for Satan, we know that his ambition is to make his Servants believe that his Power is equal to Gods, and that therefore he can preserve whom he pleaseth. I have read <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Caesarius <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 9.</NOTE> of certain Magici∣ans, who were seen walking on the Water. If then Guilty persons shall Float on the Waters, either it is the Devil that causeth them to do so, (as no doubt it is) and what have men to do to set the Devil on work; or else it is a divine Miracle, like that of <HI>Peters</HI> not <HI>S</HI>inking, or that of the Iron that Swam at the word of <HI>Elisha.</HI> And shall men try whether God will work a Miracle to make a Discovery? If a Crime cannot be found out but by Miracle, it is not for any Judge on Earth to usurp that Judgment which is reserved for the Di∣vine Throne.</P>
<P N="5">5. This pretended Gift of Immersibility attend∣ing Witches is a most fallible deceitful thing.

<P N="6">6. The Reasons commonly alledged for this Su∣perstition are of no moment. It is said they hate the water; whereas they have many times desired that they might be cast on the water in order to their purgation. It is alledged, that water is used in <HI>Baptism,</HI> therefore Witches swim. A weak Phan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. All the water in the world is not consecrated Water. Cannot Witches eat Bread or drink Wine, notwithstanding those Elements are made use of in the Blessed Sacrament. But (say some) the De∣vils by sucking of them make them so light that the water bears them. Whereas some Witches are twice as heavy as many an innocent Person. Well, but then they are Possessed with the Devil. Suppose so; Is the Devil afraid if they should sink, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he should be drowned with them? But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then

we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Gadarens</HI> Hogs drowned when the Devil was in them?</P>
<P>These things being premised, I answer the Que∣stion Affirmatively. <HI>There are Proofs for the Con∣viction of Witches which Jurors may with a safe Con∣science proceed upon, so as to bring them in Guilty.</HI> The Scripture which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, <HI>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live,</HI> clearly implies, that some in the world may be known and proved to be Witches. For until they be so, they may and must be suffered to live. More∣over we find in Scripture that some have been con∣victed and executed for Witches. For <HI>Saul cut off those that had familiar Spirits, and the Wizzards out of the Land,</HI> 1 Sam. 28. 9.</P>
<P>It may be wondred that <HI>Saul</HI> who did like him that said, <HI>Flectere si nequeo Superos Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eronta Movebo,</HI> should cause the Wizzards in the land to be put to death. The <HI>Jewish Rabbies</HI> say, the reason was be∣cause those Wizzards foretold that <HI>David</HI> should be King. It is (as Mr. <HI>Gaul</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">In his Cases about Witchcraft p. 181.</NOTE> observes) the o∣pinion of some learned Protestants, that <HI>Saul</HI> in his Zeal did overdo.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> But then the Enquiry is, <HI>What is sufficient Proof?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This Case has been with great Judgment answered by several Divines of our own, particu∣larly by Mr. <HI>Perkins,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bernard.</HI> Also Mr. <HI>John Gaule</HI> a worthy Minister at <HI>Staughton</HI> in the County of <HI>Huntington,</HI> has published a very Judici∣ous Discourse, called <HI>Select Cases of Conscience touch∣ing Witches and Witchcrafts,</HI> Printed at <HI>London A. D.</HI> 1646. wherein he does with great Prudence and Evidence of Scripture-light handle this and other Cases. Such Jurors as can obtain those Books, I would advise them to read and seriously as in the fear of God to Consider them. And so far as they keep to the Law and to the Testimony, &amp; speak ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ording to that Word, receive the Light which is in them. But the Books being now rare to be had, let me express my Concurrence with them in these two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That a free and Voluntary Confession of the Crime made by the Person Suspected and Accused after Exami∣nation, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient ground of Conviction.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="000658_0065_0FA9A257C7E95460"/>Indeed, if Persons are Distracted or under the Power of <HI>Phrenetick Melancholy</HI> that alters the case. But the Jurors that examine them, and their Neigh∣bours that know them may easily determine that case. Or if Confession be <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">v. Bodin. Daemonomania.

But if a∣ny Persons out of Remorse of Conscience, or from a Touch of God on their Spirits, confess and shew their Deeds, as the Converted Magicians in <HI>Ephesus</HI> did <HI>Act.</HI> 19. 18, 19. Nothing can be more clear. Suppose a man to be suspected for <HI>Murder,</HI> or for Committing a <HI>Rape,</HI> or the like Nefandous Wickedness, if he does freely confess the Accusation that's ground enough to condemn him. The Scrip∣ture approveth of Judging the wicked Servant out of his own Mouth. <HI>Luk.</HI> 19. 22. It is by some ob∣jected that persons in Discontent may falsely accuse themselves. I say, if they do so, and it cannot be proved, that they are false Accusers of themselves, they ought to dye for their Wickedness, and their Blood will be upon their own Heads. The Jury, the Judges, and the Land is clear. I have read a ve∣ry sad and amazing and yet a true story to this purpose</P>
<P>There was in the Year 1649 in a Town called <HI>Lauder</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> a certain woman accused and im∣prisoned on suspicion of witchcraft. When others in the same prison with her, were convicted, and their Execution ordered to be on the Monday following, she desired to speak with a Minister, to whom she
<PB N="61" REF="000658_0066_0FA9A25886381638"/>
declared freely that she was guilty of Witchcraft, acknowledging, also many other Crimes committed by her, desiring that she might dye with the Rest. <HI>S</HI>he said particularly that she had Covenanted with the <HI>D</HI>evil, and was become his Servant, about twenty years before, and that he Kissed her, and gave her a Name, but that since he had never owned her. Se∣veral Ministers who were jealous that she accused herself untruly, charged it on her Conscience, telling her that they doubted she was under a Temptation of the <HI>Devil</HI> to destroy her own Body &amp; Soul, and ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>juring her in the Name of God to declare the Truth. Notwithstanding all this, she sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly adhered to what she had said, &amp; was on Monday morning Condemned and ordered to be Executed that day. When she came to the place of Execution, she was silent until the Prayers were ended. Then going to the Stake where she was to be Burn't; she thus expressed her∣self, <HI>All you that see me this Day! Know ye that I am to Dye as a Witch by my own Confession? and I free all men, especially the Ministers, and Magistrates from the Guilt of my Blood! I take it wholly on my self, and as I must make answer to the God of Heaven, I declare I am as free from Witchcraft as any Child, but being ac∣cused by a Malicious Woman, and imprisoned under the Name of a Witch, my Husband and Friends disowned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and seeing no hope of ever being in Credit a∣gain, through the Temptation of the Devil, I made that Confession to destroy my own Life, being weary of it, and abusing rather to Dye than to Live.</HI> This her La∣mentable Speech did astonish all the Spectators, few
<PB N="62" REF="000658_0067_0FA9A25935C76138"/>
of whom could refrain from Tears. The Truth of this Relation (saith my <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Mr. Sinclare invisible World. <HI>p.</HI> 45. And B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rton History of Daemons. <HI>p.</HI> 122.</NOTE> Author) is certain∣ly attested by a Worthy Divine now living, who was an Eye and an Ear-witness of the whole mat∣ter. But thus did that Miserable Creature suffer <HI>D</HI>eath. And this was a just Execution. When the <HI>Amalekite</HI> confessed that he killed <HI>Saul,</HI> whom he he had no legal Authority to meddle with, altho 'tis probable that he belied himself, <HI>David</HI> gave order for his Execution, and said to, him, <HI>Thy Blood be upon thy head, for thy Mouth hath Testifyed against thee.</HI> 2. Sam. 1. 16. But as for the Testimony of <HI>Con∣fessing Witches</HI> against others, the case is not so clear as against themselves. They are not such Credible Witnesses, as in a Case of Life and Death is to be de∣sired. It is beyond dispute, that the <HI>D</HI>evil makes his Witches to dream strange things of themselves and others which are not so. There was (as Authors be∣yond Exception relate) in appearance a sumptuous feast prepared, the wine &amp; meat set forth in Vessels of Gold.A certain person whom an amorous young man had fallen in Love with was represented and sup∣posed to be really there, but <HI>Appollonius Tyanoeus</HI> <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Boi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard in vita Apollon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</NOTE> discovered the Witchery of the Business, and in an instant all vanished, and nothing but dirty Coales were to be seen. The like to this is men∣tioned in the <HI>Arausican</HI> Council. There were certain women that Imagined, they road upon Beasts in the night, and that they had <HI>Diana</HI> and
<PB N="63" REF="000658_0068_0FA9A259FAA76950"/>

The Council giveth this sen∣tence on it, <HI>Satanas qui se trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igurat in Angelum Lucis, transformat se in divers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>narum species, et mentem quam captivam tenet, in somnis deludi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Satan transforms himself into the likeness of diverse persons, and deludes the Souls that are his Captives with Dreams and Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sies. See Dr. <HI>Willet</HI> on 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 28. <HI>page</HI> 165. What Credit can be given to those that say they can turn men into Horses? If so, they can as well turn Horses into men. But all the Witches on earth in Conjunction with all the Devils in Hell, can never make or unmake a rational Soul; and then they cannot transform a Bruit into a man, nor a man into a Bruit. So that this Transmutation is Phantastical. The Devil may, and often does impose on the Imaginations of his Witches and Vassals, that they believe them∣selves to be Converted into Beasts, and reverted into men again. As <HI>Nebucadnezzar</HI> whilest under the Power of a <HI>Doemon</HI> really imagined himself to be an <HI>Ox,</HI> and would lye out of Doors and eat Grass. The Devil has inflicted on many a man the Disease called <HI>Lycanthropia,</HI> from whence they have made Lamentable Complaints of their being Wolves. In a word, there is no more Reality in what many Witches confess of strange things seen or done by them whilest Satan had them in his full Power, than there is in <HI>Lucian's</HI> Ridiculous Fa∣ble of his being bewitched into an <HI>Asse,</HI> and what strange Feats he then played. So that what such
<PB N="64" REF="000658_0069_0FA9A25AC1648970"/>
persons relate concerning Persons and Things at Witch-meetings, ought not to be received with too much Credulity. I could mention dismal Instan∣ces of Innocent Blood which has been shed by means of the Lies of some confessing Witches. There is a very sad Story mentioned in the Preface to the Relation of the Witchcrafts in <HI>Sweedland,</HI> how that in the year 1676. at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> a young wo∣man accused her own Mother (who had indeed been a very bad woman, but not guilty of Witch∣craft, and Swore that she had carried her to the Nocturnal meetings of Witches, upon which the Mother was burnt to death. Soon after the Daughter came crying and howling before the Judges in open Court, declaring that to be revenged on her Mother for an Offence received, she had falsely accused her with a Crime which she was not guilty of: for which she also was justly Exe∣cuted. A most wicked man in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> freely Con∣fessed himself to be a Magician; and accused ma∣ny others whose Lives were thereupon taken from them, and a whole Province had like to have been ruined thereby; but the imposture was discovered. The Confessing pretended Wizzard was burnt at <HI>Paris</HI> in the year 1668. I shall only take notice further of an awful Example mentioned by A. B. <HI>Spotswood</HI> in his History of Scotland. p. 449. His words are these. <Q>This Summer (<ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> Anno. 1997.) There was a great business for the Try∣al of Witches; amongst others one <HI>Margaret Atkin</HI> being apprehended on Suspicion and threatned
<PB N="65" REF="000658_0070_0FA9A25B8C8E0510"/>
with Torture, did confess herself Guilty. Being Examined touching her Associates in that Trade, she named a few, and perceiving her Delations find Credit, made offer to detect all of that sort, and to purge the Country of them; so she might have her Life granted. For the reason of her Knowledge, she said, <HI>that they had a secret mark all of that sort in their Eyes, whereby she could surely tell, how soon she Looked upon any, whether they were Witches or not.</HI> And in this, she was so readily believed, that for the space of 3 or 4 Moneths she was carried from Town to Town to make Discoveries in that kind. Many were brought in Question by her Delations, especially at <HI>Glas∣gow,</HI> where <HI>diverse Innocent women, through the Credulity of the Minister</HI> Mr. <HI>John Cowper, were condemned and put to death.</HI> In the end she was found to be a meer deceiver, and sent back to <HI>Fife,</HI> where she was first apprehended. At her Tryal she Affirmed all to be false that she had confessed of her self or others, and persisted in this to her death, which made many fore-think their too great Forwardness that way, and moved the King to recal his Commissions given out against such persons, discharging all Proceedings against them, except in case of Voluntary Con∣fession, till a solid Order should be taken by the Estates touching the form that should be kept in their Tryal.</Q> Thus that famous Historian</P>

<P>Some are ready to say, that Wizzards are not so unwise as to do such things in the Sight or Hearing of others. But it is certain that they have very often been known to do so. How often have they been seen by others using Inchantmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s? Conjuring to raise Storms? And have been heard calling upon their Familiar Spirits? And have been known to use Spells and Charms? And to shew in a Glass or in a Shew-stone persons absent? And to reveal Secrets which could not be discovered but by the Devil?

<P>THe First Case proposed, Whether Satan may not appear in the Shape of an Innocent and Pious as well as of a N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cent and Wicked person to Afflict such as suffer by Diabolical Mol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tations?</P>
<P>The Affirmative proved from Six Arguments.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. From several Scriptures. <HI>p.</HI> 2.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Because it is possible for the Devil in the Shape of Innocent Persons to do other mischiefs, proved by many Instances. <HI>p.</HI> 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Because if Satan may not represent an Innocent Person as Afflicting others, it must be either because he wants will, or Power to do this, or because God will never permit him so to do it: Either of which may be affirmed. <HI>p.</HI> 14.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It is certain both from Scripture and History that Magicians by their Inchantments and Hellish Conjurati∣ons may cause a false Representation of Persons and Things. <HI>p.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. From the concurring Judgment of many Learned and Judicious men. <HI>p.</HI> 28.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Our own Experience has confirmed the Truth of what we affirm. <HI>p.</HI> 33.</ITEM>

<ITEM>The Second Case considered, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> if one bewitched be cast down with the Look or Cast of the Eye of ano∣ther Person, and after that recovered again by a Touch from the same Person, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this an infallible Proof that the Party Accused and Complained of is in Cove∣nant with the Devil <HI>p.</HI> 34.</ITEM>

<LIST>
<PB REF="000658_0074_0FA9A260C2E2B560"/>
<ITEM>1. Tis possible that the Persons in Question may be possessed with evil Spirits. Signs of such. <HI>p.</HI> 38.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Falling down with the Cast of the Eye proceeds not from a natural but an Arbitrary Caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>p.</HI> 41.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That of the bewitched Persons being recovered with a Touch is various and fallible. <HI>p.</HI> 45.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There are that Question the Lawfulness of the Experiment. <HI>p.</HI> 46.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Testimony of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or possessed Persons is no Evidence as to what they see concerning others, &amp; therefore not as to themselves. <HI>p.</HI> 48.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Bewitched persons have sometimes been struck down with the Look of Doggs. <HI>p.</HI> 49.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. If this were an infallible proof, there would be dif∣ficulty in discovering Witches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Nothing can be produced out of the Word of God to shew that this is any Proof of Witchcraft. <HI>p.</HI> 50.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Antipathies in nature have strange and un∣accountable effects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Third Case considered▪ whether there are any Discoveries of Witchcraft which Jurors and Judges may with a safe Conscience proceed upon to the Conviction and Condemnation of the Persons under Suspicion? <HI>p.</HI> 51.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>Two Things premised,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Evidence in the Crime of Witchcraft ought to be as clear as in any other Crimes of a Capital nature. <HI>p.</HI> 52.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there have been ways of Trying Witches long used, which God never approved of. More parti∣cularly that of casting the suspected Party into the Water to try whether they will Sink or Swim. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and great Sin which is in that way of Purgation evin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by six Reasons. <HI>p.</HI> 52. to 57</ITEM>

<ITEM>That there are Proofs for the Conviction of Witches,

which Jurors may with a safe Conscience proceed upon, proved from Scripture. <HI>p.</HI> 58.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That a free and Voluntary Confession is a sufficient Ground of Conviction. <HI>p.</HI> 59.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Testimony of confessing Witches against others is not so clear an Evidence, as against themselves. <HI>p.</HI> 62.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That if two Credible Persons shall affirm upon Oath that they have seen the Person accused doing things which none but such as have Familiarity with the De∣vil ever did or can do, that's a sufficient Ground of Conviction: And that this has often hapned. <HI>p.</HI> 65.</ITEM>

<HEAD>Postscript</HEAD>
<P>THE Design of the Preceeding <HI>Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tation,</HI> is not to plead for Witchcrafts, or to appear as an Ad∣vocate for Witches. I have therefore written a∣nother Discourse, proving that there are such horrid Crea∣tures as Witches in the World; and that they are to be extirpated and cut off from amongst the People of God, which I have Thoughts and inclinations in due time to Pub∣lish. And I am abundantly satisfied that there have been, and are still most cursed Witches in the Land. More then one or two of those now in Prison, have freely, and credibly acknowledged their Communion and Familiarity with the Spirits of Darkness, and have also declared unto me the Time and Occasion, with the particular c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cum∣stances of their Hellish Obligations and Abominations.</P>
<P>Nor is there designed any Reflection on those Worthy Persons who have been concerned in the late Proceedings at S<HI>alem.</HI> They are wise and good men, and have acted with all Fidelity according to their Light, and have out of tenderness declined the doing of some things, which in their own Judgments they were satisfied about. Having
<PB REF="000658_0076_0FA9A2624AD6A880"/>
therefore so arduous a case before them, Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and Pray∣ers rather than Cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures are their due. On which Account I am glad that there is Published to the World (by my Son) a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trials</HI> of some who were lately Executed, whereby I hope the thinking part of mankind will be satisfied, that there was more than that which is called <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for the Conviction of the persons Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. I was not my self present at any of the Trials, excepting one, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> that of <HI>George Burre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;</HI> had I been one of his Judges, I could not have acquitted him. For several persons did upon Oath Testify, that they saw him do such things as no man that has not a Devil to be his Familiar could perform. And the Judges affirm that they have not Convicted any one meerly on the account of what <HI>Spectres</HI> have said, or of what has been Represent∣ed to the Eyes or Imaginations of sick bewitched persons. If what is here exposed to publick view, may be a means to prevent it for the future, I shall not repent of my La∣bour in this Undertaking. I have been prevailed with so far as I am able to discern the Truth in these dark cases, to declare my Sentiments, with the Arguments which are of weight with me, hoping that what is written may be of some use to discover the <HI>Depths of Satan;</HI> and to prevent innocent ones having their Lives Endangered, or their Reputations Ruin'd, by being through the subtilty and Power of the Devils, in consideration with the Ignorance and Weakness of men, involved amongst th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guilty. It becomes those of my profession to be very tender in cases of Blood, and to imitate our <HI>L</HI>ord and Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, <HI>Who came not to destroy the Lives of men, but to save them.</HI></P>
<P>I likewise design in what I have written, to give my Testimony against these unjustifiable wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of disco∣vering Witchcrafts, which some among us have practised. I hear that of late there was a <HI>Witch-cake</HI> made with the Urine of Bewitched Creatures as one ingredient by seve∣ral persons in a place, which has suffered much by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="000658_0077_0FA9A262F80C1D30"/>
of Hell upon it. This I take to be not only wicked Superstition, but great Folly. For tho the Devil does sometimes operate with the <HI>Experiments,</HI> yet not alwayes, especially if a <HI>Magical Faith</HI> be wanting. I shall here take occasion to recite some passages in a Letter, which I Re∣ceived from that Eminent Pious and Learned Man, (Mr. <HI>Samuel Cradock;</HI> during my Abode in <HI>London.</HI> The Let∣ter bears date <HI>February</HI> 26. 1690. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take it in his own words, which are these. <Q>We have at this present one in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town, who has a Son who has strange Fits, and such as they impute to Witchcraft. He came to consult with me about it, but before he came, he had u∣sed a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I should never have directed him un∣to, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> He took the Nails of his Sons hands and feet, and some of his Hair, and mixed them in Rye-paste with his water, and so set it all by the Fire till it was con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ned, and his Son (as he says) was well after, and free from his Fits for a whole month, but then they came again, and <HI>He tried that means a second time, and then it would not do.</HI> He removed his Son into <HI>Cambridgeshire</HI> the next County, and then he was well, but as soon as he brought him home, he was afflicted as before. The Boy says, he saw a thing like a Mole following of him, which once spoke to him, and told him he came to do the office he was to do. I advised his Father to make use of the Medicine prescribed by our Saviour, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Fasting and Prayer. Here have been others in this Town, that though they were under <HI>Ill-handling</HI> as they call it: one Family had their Milk so affected that they could not possibly make any Cheese, but it hov'd &amp; swelled and was good for nothing. They are now <HI>r</HI>id of that trouble, but how they got rid of it I do not know.</Q> Thus my Letter. By which it is evident that Towns in <HI>England</HI> as well as <HI>New-England</HI> are molested with D<HI>oemons,</HI> only I wish that the Supersti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ons practised in other places to get rid of such trou∣blesome

Guests had never been known, much le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> used amongst us or them.</P>
<P>Some I hear have taken up a notion, that the Book newly Published by my Son, is contradictory to this of mine. 'Tis strange that such Imaginations should en∣ter into the minds of men I peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and approved of that Book before it was Printed. And nothing but my Relation to him hindr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me from Recommending it to the World. But my self and Son agreed unto the Humble Advice which twelve Ministers concurringly presented be∣fore his Excellency and Council, respecting the present dif∣ficulties, which let the World judge whether there be any thing in its di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>entany from what is attested by either of us.</P>
<P>It was in the words following.</P>
<P><HI>The Return of several Ministers Consulted by His Excellency, and the Honourable Council, upon the pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Witchcra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts in</HI> Salem-<HI>Village.</HI> Boston, June 15. 1692.</P>
<P N="1">1. T<HI>He Afflicted State of our poor Neighbours, that are now Suffering by Mole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tations from the Invisible World, we apprehend so deplorable, that we think their Condi∣tion calls for the utmost Help of all persons in their</HI> several Capacities▪ II. <HI>We cannot but with all Thankfulness Acknow∣ledge, the</HI> Success <HI>which the Merciful God has given unto the Sedulous and Assiduous Endeavours of our Honourable Rulers, to detect the Abominable</HI> Witch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rafts <HI>which have been Com∣mitted in the Country; Humbly praying that the Discovery of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Mysterious and Mischievous Wickedness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, may be perfect∣ed.</HI> III. <HI>We judge that in the prosecution of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, and all such Witchcrafts, there is need of a very critical and Exquisite</HI> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, <HI>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by too much</HI> Credulity <HI>for Things, received only upon the Devils Authority, there be a</HI> D<HI>oor opened for a long Train of miserable Consequences; and</HI> S<HI>atan get an Advantage over us, for we should not be</HI> Ignorant of his Devices.
