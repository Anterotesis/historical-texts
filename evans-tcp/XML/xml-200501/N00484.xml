<P>WHereas I have been lately accused by a certain Person, be∣fore divers Witnesses, for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Author of a certain Book, called, <HI>The Two Hundred Queries,</HI> printed at <HI>London</HI> eight Years ago, his Proof being, <HI>That four or five Years ago he had it from my own Mouth;</HI> but being put to bring Evidence from Witnesses, he said, <HI>He could prove it by such Circumstances which I told him, that I could not deny.</HI> I answered him; It being so many Years ago, he might
<PB N="2" REF="000609_0002_0FA9613F9330A0D0"/>
justly question his Memory, seeing when I called him to bear witness to things he had heard spoken but some few days or weeks past, he hath said, <HI>He could not remember them, his Memory being weak, and he had rather forget than remember such things.</HI> He did also further charge me, <HI>That he heard me say, I believed I should be moved of God to preach the Doctrine of the Revolutions,</HI> as he termed it; but what Revolutions I meant, he did not tell; for there are many Revolutions, and of many sorts; The which I do not remember I ever said to him; and as he may understand the Revolutions, his so charging me may be an utter Falshood and Slander; for there are some sorts of Revolutions relating to the Souls of men, that cannot be denyed, if we own the <HI>Resurrection of the dead,</HI> according to Scripture, and our conveyance and descent out of the loyns of our Ancestors up to <HI>Adam,</HI> accor∣ding to the Scriptures; see <HI>Gen.</HI> 46. 26. <HI>Hosea</HI> 12.4. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.9, 10. and the word <HI>Revolution,</HI> is the true English of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Gilgal,</HI> mentioned <HI>Josh.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Ezck.</HI> 10.13. and this with respect to men (see the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Text, and Margen of the English Bible; also, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upha</HI> is translated three several times [<HI>Revolution</HI>] by the Translators of our English Bible, and set on the Margen by them; see <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. 22. 1 <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x.</HI> 1. 20. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24.23. And where∣as I declared, That I did not remember that ever I owned my self to be the Author of that Book, or that I said, I did believe, that I should be moved of God to preach the Revolutions; but on the contrary, seeing I do not remember it, and my Memory is as good as his, if not better, I did and do hold it to be rashly and foolishly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ged by him, and for which he may be accounted a false Accuser; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can I think that ever I said such a thing, because I never made the Opinion of the Revolutions, as delivered in that Book, or as vulgarly held by its Alserters, a matter of my Faith, or as any divine Opening; besides, his varying the Charge, as Witnesses can prove, saying first, <HI>I knew not but I might be moved, &amp;c.</HI> and last saying, <HI>I believed I should be moved, &amp;c.</HI> which differ widely, and make the whole justly incredible. But he did so earnestly assert them, that he said, <HI>As God was in Heaven it was true;</HI> which some of us that heard him, were greatly offended with, judging it to be an Oath, as that Oath or manner of Swearing under the Law, <HI>As the Lord liveth,</HI> Jer. 5. 2. And I said to him, this is more than Yea or Nay, which Christ hath command∣ed us to keep unto in all our Communications, for whatsoever is
<PB N="3" REF="000609_0003_0FA96140668B5710"/>
more than the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, cometh of Evil; and many of us have suffered much in Old <HI>England</HI> for refusing to swear in any case, even before a Ma∣gistrate. However, let it be considered, whether it be not a Breach of all common Civility or Morality among men, to make Publick a thing secretly spoken (if the thing had been spoke by me, as he affirmeth) that he thought might tend to my Prejudice; nor doth it excuse him, to say, <HI>I lately told some-what he spoke to me in private;</HI> for that was such a thing he might have spoke to any, and did not tend to his, or any mans Prejudice, and was no secrecy. And whether his asserting a thing without any Proof, but what we take to be a very great Oath, will be any sufficient Witness or Evidence, in point of common Justice among men? for if this be allowed, not only mens Fame and Reputation, but Property, Liberty and Life itself lieth at stake to be taken away most unjustly.</P>
<P>But to answer directly to his Charge; I do say, after the best Recollection of my Memory that I can make, after so many Years past, I do not remember that I said to him, I was the Author of that Book, and I know not how he can justly think, considering these very Cir∣custances he alledgeth, and some other Circumstances whereof he can∣not be ignorant, unless he hath forgotten the whole; for I told him, that divers Persons were concerned in that Book, called, <HI>The Two Hundred Queries,</HI> and after what manner. Besides, another Person hath in Print divers Years ago owned that Book; and why then should he charge me with that which another hath owned. The most he can justly alledge, Is, <HI>That I said a considerable part of the Matter of that Book, which I had from another, I put into Writing;</HI> which will not prove me to be the Author; for I oft put into writing other mens words, even such as are Adversaries; and many do write for others that whereof they are not the Authors. But I further say, I never justly could, nor do own my self to be the Author of that Book (how far I might be concerned otherwise in it, in any part or in the writing of a great part of the Matter of it, is not material nor necessary for me to determine, for others were concerned; and he who accuseth me of a thing which he cannot prove by outward Evidence, by so doing rather proveth himself a false Accuser, and showeth both his own Folly and Prejudice against me: And I say yet further, as no man living can prove me to be the Author of that Book, so I had not the least hand in the Printing it; for it was printed altogether without
<PB N="4" REF="000609_0004_0FA961410AA72470"/>
my Consent and Approbation. And the Defaults (whether in the Transcribing, or in the Printing it,) are so many, that it hath quite altered the sence of the Queries in many places, and made others of them Non-sensical; and there are things in it for which I am no wise accountable, and which I never did own, or do own to be mine; yet I cannot disown or blame the whole, but make a distinction; for there are things queried in that Book, that are no wise unbecoming the best Christians, and which mention nothing of the Revolutions, so called nor doth imply them, except by such remote seeming Con∣sequences, which one may as readily deny, as another may affirm, and they have no more necessary connexion with the Revolutions, than the Scriptures have, that are cited in them; and I am not convinced, that it is a Trespass to query things that call not into Question any one Article of the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI> But further, to clear the matter, I do affirm, that I never said to any, nor did I ever conclude in my thoughts, that the Doctrine of the Revolutions, as they are commonly understood, or as delivered in that Book, was the matter of my Faith, or were things inwardly revealed or opened to me by the Spirit of Truth, as I am free to say concerning all things of my <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> which I both believe and profess; nor have I ever had any Contro∣versie, Strife or Contention with any man about the Revolutions, so called, and I have been very shy and backward, either to lend or recommend the said Book. But it is one thing what a man may suppose to be a probable Opinion, or rational Hypothesis (either as touching the Doctrine of the Revolutions, of which there are many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> asserted by Authors, or as touching any other Doctrine in Astro∣nomy or Physick) and it is far another thing what a man asserts to be his Christian Faith, grounded upon the inward Evidence and Te∣stimony of Gods Spirit in the Heart.</P>
<P>But as to my real sence of the Opinion of that called the Revolutions, which do generally relate to Times past (and not with the least cer∣tainty to any one perticular Person to the time to come) ever since the Death of Christ. If any hold any such Opinion or Doctrine of them (as I know none that do,) that doth teach, <HI>That men may delay their Repentance, or living a good Life, in hope that they shall live again after Death▪</HI> I do sincerely declare, I have always abhorred any such Doctrine, and judged it Wicked and Abominable, and still I do so judge, and hope so to do while I live; and I have upon many
<PB N="5" REF="000609_0005_0FA96141E29F0980"/>
occasions born my Zealous Testimony, both in publick and in private to the contrary, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That to entertain any such hope, to live again in order to Repent, and live a good Life, after a man has neglected the present Opportunity wherein to Repent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in this present Life, is as Wicked as it is vain; for <HI>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation teacheth us to deny Ungodliness and Worlaly Lusts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> live soberly, righteously and godly in this present World, Tit. 2. 11, 12.</HI> But it teach∣eth no man to delay his good living to any time after Death, either in hope of a Purgatory, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Soul is out of the Body, or in hope to live again in a mortal Body; for <HI>NOW is the accepted Time, NOW is the Day of Salvation,</HI> 2 Cor. 6. 2. <HI>And it is the last Time,</HI> as <HI>John</HI> hath declared, <HI>1 John 2. 18.</HI> And also <HI>Paul,</HI> saying, <HI>Rom. 13.11. And that knowing the Time, that NOW it is high Time to awake out of sleep, &amp;c. let us therefore east off the Works of Darkness, and put on the Armour of Light, for the Times of Ignorance God wincked at, but NOW com∣mandeth all men every where to Repent,</HI> Acts 17. 30. And as <HI>John</HI> said, Mat. 3. 10. <HI>And NOW also the Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees, therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the Fire.</HI> And therefore if any hold such Doctrine of Revo∣lutions, that putteth men upon delaying their Repentance, or neg∣lecting to live a good Life, in hope to live again after Death, to Re∣pent and Amend, as I have alwayes abhorred it, so I hope I shall alwayes do, and bear my faithful Testimony against it.</P>
<P>And whereas the said Person hath accused me before divers Witnes∣ses, <HI>That my manner of Preaching the Faith of Christ Crucified and Raised again, its being necessary to make men Christians and Sons of God of the Free Woman, and Children of the New-Covenant, doth infer my holding of the Revolutions, to wit, that all pious</HI> Gentiles, <HI>dying without all hear∣ing Christ crucified and raised again preached to them, must of necessity live again in a mortal Body, in order to hear that Doctrine outwardly preached to them, or then be damned.</HI> The which Alternative I Possitively deny. And by this his Accusation, he hath shown what a Changeling he is, from better to worse, in so finding fault with my Doctrine for Preaching or Printing the necessity of this Faith to Salvation, which he hath so frequently hold forth himself &amp; owned and approved in my books. And I propose it to the serious Consideration of all sincere <HI>Christians,</HI> Whether this Difficulty (how much so ever
<PB N="6" REF="000609_0006_0FA9B7A8DA72D408"/>
real or seeming) doth more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, than all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that universally assert the necessity of Faith in Christ crucified and raised again, to make men true and sincere <HI>Christians,</HI> and that by this Faith men are justified, sanctified, and attain to eternal Life; and that therefore no <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Turk</HI> can be a true <HI>Christian,</HI> because they have not this Faith, however otherwise just and conscientious they may be? And whether, seeing the whole strain and current of the Scripture, both of the Old and New Testament, is such as doth de∣monstrate the necessity of this Faith and Gospel to be preached to all Nations, to wit, That Christ Jesus the Son of God dyed for our sins, and rose again for our Justification; and that it is plain from express Scripture, That this Justification is not obtained, nor Sal∣vation (to wit) finally, fully and perfectly, without this Faith, I say, Whether in opposition to, and in prejudice of the Revolutions, and for avoiding that Doctrine, and laying it aside, we must and ought to lay aside the Preaching and Faith of Christ as he outwardly dyed for our sins on the Tree of the Cross, and rose again for our Justification, as a thing unnecessary and indifferent, as it must needs be, if men may be compleat and perfect <HI>Christians</HI> without this Faith, and perfectly overcome all sin, and attain to a perfect state of Sancti∣fication without it, and may be Children of God, and Sons of the free Woman, and have the Spirit of Adoption without this Faith? And if so, then doth not this wholly render Pious <HI>Paganism</HI> or <HI>Gen∣tilism</HI> to be perfect <HI>Christianity,</HI> and perfect <HI>Christianity</HI> to be nothing else than pious <HI>Gentilism?</HI> And doth not this make the Faith and Knowledge of Christ, both without us and within us, of none effect? for it cannot be proved, that ever any had the true Knowledge or Faith of Christ within them, but who had the true Knowledge and Faith of Christ within them; for though Christ was and is in Pious and Conscientious <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in their meer <HI>Gentile state,</HI> yet they did not know him, as such; nor did they believe in him, as Christ, as all sincere <HI>Christians</HI> did and do. And shall not this be of most evil tendency, thus to make void the Faith of Christ crucified without us, and raised again, (in prejudice of, and in opposition to that call'd the <HI>Revolutions,</HI> as my Accuser hath done, though he himself hath declared his favouring of the Revolutions as a probable Hypothesis, and hath frequently, and but very lately declared the necessity of the Faith of Christ, as he was crucified and raised from the dead with∣out

us, its being necessary to Salvation, bringing for it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.9. whereof many are Witnesses. And to say, This Faith is necessary to such to whom it is preached, to make them <HI>Christians,</HI> and per∣fectly to justifie, sanctifie and save them, but not to such Pious <HI>Gentiles</HI> to whom it is not preached, as if they could be perfectly <HI>Christians,</HI> and perfectly justified, perfectly sanctified, and perfectly, wholly and fully saved without it; this most evidently doth contradict the Scripture, that holdeth forth the necessity of its being preached, that it may be received, in Gods ordinary way of working; for which see <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke</HI> 24. 46, 47. <HI>Acts 4. 10, 11, 12.</HI> cap. 10. 43, 44. cap. 11. 14. cap. 13. 46. cap. 28. 28. compared with <HI>vers.</HI> 23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 30. cap. 8. 2, 3, 4. cap. 16. 25, 26. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. 4, 5, 6. &amp; 1. 13. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28. And surely, if the Gospel and Faith of Christ, both outwardly and inwardly was not necessary to be preached to the Nations, to Salvation, then Christs Command to the Apostles to preach it, was a superfluous and unnecessary work, and in vain was it, that so many Thousands should suffer Martyrdom and Killing for that Faith, and the preaching of it. And at this rate the Gospel and Faith of Christ, both without us, and within us, is not only an unprofitable, but a burdensom Yoke of Bondage, laid on People, by having it preacht to them, seeing they could have been good and perfect <HI>Christians</HI> with∣out it, if they had never had it preached to them, and could have been perfectly Justified, perfectly sanctified, and perfectly saved without it, in their meer <HI>Gentile state;</HI> which is a plain overturning and over∣throwing the <HI>Christian Religion, Faith</HI> and <HI>Gospel,</HI> and an evident con∣firming what the Adversaries of Truth have cast upon us, the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> That their <HI>Christianity</HI> is nothing else but refined <HI>Pa∣ganism</HI> or <HI>Gentilism;</HI> but I hope all the sincere hearted and true Lovers of Christ are and will be otherwise minded, and stand up with holy Zeal to assert their true <HI>Christianity,</HI> and <HI>Christian Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> to be altogether another thing than the most refined Picus <HI>Gentilism,</HI> and differing from it as much as Gold differs from Brass, or as the Light of the Day differs from the Light of the Night, and that principally be∣cause they have the true Knowledge and Faith of Christ as he dyed for them (without them) and rose again is gone into Heaven, there making intercession for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and also living and ruling in them, conforming them to his <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Resurrection,</HI> which they could not have without the Faith of him, as he was outwardly crucified and raised again.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000609_0008_0FA9614353CF3678"/>But if any say, <HI>The Gospel and Faith of Christ, as he dyed and rose again, tho' not absolutely necessary to perfect mens Salvation, yet is very profitable to facilitate, and make the Work the more easily and speedily to be done.</HI>—<HI>I Answ.</HI> If not necessary, it may be concluded not profitable, nor of service to make the Work more easie; for wherein is it more profitable, not being necessary? for in all other things that are not absolutely necessary, but profitable and serviceable, the profit &amp; service is apparent, as when a man may labour the ground to raise Corn, with Hoe and other Instruments, without plowing, or a man may go from one place to another by walking, without riding or sailing; but no such thing is apparent in this case, as if the necessity of the true Know∣ledge and Faith of Christ, both without us, and within us, which can∣not be divided, be once laid aside, that it cannot be supposed to be profitable, but rather it ought to be concluded both unprofitable and hurtful, as enjoyning more Precepts relating to God, to our Selves, and to our Neighbours, than the <HI>Gentile Dispensation</HI> did or doth; and for this cause it is, that <HI>Christianity</HI> excelleth <HI>Judaism,</HI> and is far more pro∣fitable and serviceable to perfect our Salvation, as containing fewer Precepts than the Law under <HI>Judaism</HI> did; and at this rate it would follow, because <HI>Gentilism</HI> containeth fewer Precepts than 
<HI>Christianity,</HI> therefore <HI>Gentilism</HI> is the more profitable, &amp; doth more facilitate mens Perfection, who are under it, even as an Artist that can perfect his work with fewer and less chargeable Tools &amp; Instruments, is the most perfect, and is worthy of most praise; but because all the Precepts of <HI>Christianity</HI> are spiritual, and given us by God and Christ, to bring us to that spiritual Perfection that the Law, either of <HI>Judaism</HI> or <HI>Gentilism</HI> simply considered, could not do, the Law being weak, through the Flesh, and so could not make perfect; therefore it is, that on that very account <HI>Christianity</HI> is the most excellent Dispensation, both for its Spirituality, and giving more plenty of Precepts than <HI>Gentilism</HI> did or doth; for as <HI>Christianity</HI> hath more plenty of Precepts that are highly spiritual, and tending to a more high and spiritual Perfection than <HI>Gentilism,</HI> so it hath more plenty of divine Grace and of Life, to enable them who are under it, to perform them, whereby they attain to the Perfection designed. But this Doctrine, <HI>That the Gospel &amp; Faith of Christ, both outwardly and inwardly, is not necessary to perfect the work of mens Salvation,</HI> doth most manifestly contradict the whole current of holy Scripture, and is a most pernicious and pestiferous Principle,
<PB N="9" REF="000609_0009_0FA96145E55BA4F8"/>
altogether tending to the dishonour of God and Christ, and contradi∣cting his holy and divine Attributes of <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Justice, Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and to the deceiving the Souls of men, that credit it, to lead them into the Pit of Destruction, and therefore ought to be, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> godly and servent Zeal, witnessed against, and reproved, notwith∣standing of the foolish and Idle Clamours of the Ignorant, and Self∣conceited, and Self-wised Men that oppose it, whatever their Pre∣tences be, either in Prejudice of the <HI>Doctrine of the Revolutions,</HI> so called, or any other whatsoever; for the Faith and Gospel of Christ, as he is both without us, and within us, which cannot be divided, being one of the greatest of Truths, how can it infer any Error or dangerous and hurtful Consequence, either relating to the Revolutions or any things else; and if any either do not or cannot see, but that the necessity of the Faith and Gospel of Christ crucified and raised, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to perfect Salvation, must needs infer the Necessity of the <HI>Doctrine of the Revolutions,</HI> at least after some sort, but not as vulgarly understood, I do say, it is more tollerable to admit the Consequent, than to deny the Antecedent; for the Consequent, in respect to the Antecedent, is but a matter of small Moment (whether true of false, I meddle not at present to determine) and if an Error, is but of an inferiour degree, and is rather an Error in that call'd Philosophy, than in Divinity, and is rather a mistake in Opinion, grounded upon a pre∣tence of Reason, than any Error in the Faith, unless it can be demon∣strated that the said Doctrine doth expresly, &amp; without any far-fetcht Consequences contradict some Article of the <HI>Christain Faith,</HI> the which remote and far-fetch't Consequences are not allowable among vulgar Christians, however sincere, because there may be a Fallacy, or at least a great uncertainty in them; but an Error in the Antecedent, to wit, That the Gospel and Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, (as he was cru∣cified for our sins, and rose agian for our Justification, and is our Elder Brother and high Priest in Heaven without us, making Intercession for us) is not necessary to be preached to the Nations for Remission of Sin, and eternal Salvation, to finish and perfect it, is a most vile and abominable Heresie, most worthily to be detested by all sincere <HI>Christians,</HI> and the Assertors and Abettors of it most worthily to be judged No <HI>Christians,</HI> yea, worse, than honest <HI>Heathens,</HI> who have never and Christ preached unto them.</P>

<P>THe Explanation of my sence in this weighty matter, I deliver in the following particulars <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> By <HI>Faith in the Man Christ Jesus without us,</HI> which I assert to to be universally necessary to mens eternal Salvation, I do not under∣stand an express distinct Faith in Christ, as being so necessary to all, whereby all that were or shall be saved, must necessarily have such a Knowledge and Faith of him, as to these great and weighty Passages and Cases delivered prophetically concerning him, in the Old Testa∣ment, and Historically in the New Testament, that were a fullfilling of the Prophecies of him, such as, 1. <HI>That he should come in the Flesh at such a precise Age or Time of the World;</HI> 2. <HI>That he should be born at</HI> Bethlem; 3. <HI>That he should be the Son of</HI> Abraham <HI>and</HI> David, <HI>accor∣ding to the Flesh;</HI> 4. or <HI>That his Mothers Name <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></HI> Mary, <HI>or his own Name Jesus;</HI> 5. <HI>That the place of his Death should be</HI> Golgotha, <HI>without the City of</HI> Jerusalem <HI>in</HI> Judea; 6. <HI>That the manner of his Death should be by being crucified, his Hands and Feet pierced, and his Side pierced with a Spear;</HI> 7. <HI>That he should be betrayed by</HI> Judas, <HI>and sold for thirty pieces of Silver, and sentenced to Death by</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>and accused and slain by the</HI> Jews, <HI>and crucified betwixt two <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, whereof the one should be penitent, and dye believing in him;</HI> 8. <HI>That he should be laid in a Sepulchre, where no man ever lay, that belonged to</HI> Joseph <HI>of</HI> Arimathea;

yet it was, without all doubt, faithfully delivered and preached by <HI>Adam</HI> to his Children, and by the faithful of their Children, such as <HI>Seth,</HI> to their succeeding Posterity, even until <HI>Noah;</HI> and if it was lost again, it was restored to <HI>Abraham;</HI> for we have good cause to believe, that the Church of God, from the beginning of the World, hath never failed in the Earth, universally, to this Day, nor will to the end of the World, however at times it hath been much obscured and hid, both under the Old and New Testament. And by this Seed of the Woman is to be understood the <HI>Man Christ,</HI> with the spiritual inward blessings of Grace, Light and Life flowing from him, (and though the outward Name <HI>Jesus</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> is sweet and comfort∣able to every true Believer (by the Spirit of Christ) that knoweth it, yet it is no more simply necessary, than the other (above-mentioned) weighty Circumstances concerning him) the <HI>Saviour and Redeemer of the World,</HI> who should be born in Flesh, and offer up himself a Sacrifice in his Body of Flesh, for the sins of the World, and should dye and rise again, and by his Death and Resurrection should bruise the Ser∣pents Head, that is, conquer and break his Power in all the faithful, so as perfectly to deliver them from Death, both Spiritual and Na∣tural, the Spiritual here, and the Natural hereafter, at the Resur∣rection of the Dead: And by the <HI>bruising of his Heel,</HI> is understood his Sufferings and Death in the Flesh, occasioned by the Devil's Insti∣gation, as all found <HI>Christians</HI> of all Professions generally acknowledge; and in Testimony of this Faith it was, that the Faithful before the Law, and under the Law, by Gods direction, offered up Sacrifices of clean Beasts, that were Types and Memorials of Christ, the Lamb of God, that was to be slain and offered up for the sins of the World, and the Faith of all the faithful, for the Remission of sin, and cleansing and sanctifying, was not in the Sacrifices which they offered, but in Christ, whom they represented, and of whom they were Types. And before Christ came in the flesh, not only the People of <HI>Israel</HI> offered Sacrifices, and practised Circumcision, all which were Typical of Christ in the Flesh, but many other Nations, as not only the <HI>Posterity of Ishmael</HI> and <HI>Esan,</HI> but other Nations that learned it of them. And that <HI>Circumcision</HI> was Typical of Christ, and had a special Relation to Christ, and Faith in him, as he was to come in the Flesh, and to his Death and sufferings, is clear from <HI>Rom. 4. 11.</HI> where it is called, <HI>A Seal of the Righteousness of Faith.</HI> And as the Church of God hath never fail∣ed

in the Earth since the beginning of the World, nor will to the end of it, so nor hath the Doctrin of Gods Salvation concerning the <HI>Saviour of the World,</HI> and the <HI>Mediator betwixt God and Men,</HI> who should be both <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>MAN,</HI> failed, or been wanting, as in respect of the essential parts of it, even from being outwardly preserved, delivered and conveyed from from Age to Age, in some measure and degree, for the benefit of Mankind in general; and therefore in all Ages, even in the Darkest, Christ, as he was to come in the Flesh, and be an offer∣ing for the Sins of the World, was sufficiently set forth for that time, to be the Object of mens Faith, in those Ages and Parts of the World, where these Types and Figures of Sacrifices, and Circumcision were extant; and even these who did not practise them, yet might hear of them by others, and it may be very probably defended by a rational Hypothesis, (and so doth <HI>R. B.</HI> call his Doctrine in his <HI>6th Thesis, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an Hypothesis</HI>) that no Nation under Heaven was so left destitute of all outward means, but that partly by the Report of the Sacrifices of clean Beasts offered to the true God, and by Circumcision, and other Types, Figures and Shadows that had been used from the begin∣ning, and partly from the Types and Figures given to Man∣kind in general, in the whole visible Creation, the Mediator be∣twixt God and Men, the Saviour and Redeemer of the World, who should be both God and Man, or God manifest in Flesh, and who, as Man, should dye for the sins of the World, and rise again, was proposed (in some sort, though obscurely, answering to that Dis∣pensation, wherein Christ was the Mystery hid from Ages and Generations, that was in after Ages clearly to be revealed) accor∣ding to <HI>Ephes.</HI> cap. 3. 5, 9. <HI>Col.</HI> cap. 1. 26. <HI>Rom.</HI> cap. 16. 26. and set forth to be the Object of mens Faith, and Hope of Salvation, and Remission of sin, and Reconciliation with God, the inward Light of the divine Word, that is the Light of men, that ever did in all Ages, and ever doth, and ever will enlighten every man that cometh into the World, acting or operating by its heavenly and divine Influ∣ence, upon their reasonable Faculties of Understanding, and all their national Powers, to cause them both know and believe, that God would be merciful to them, and forgive their sins, upon their Repent∣ance and Amendment of Life, for the sake of the Mediator, Redeemer <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of the World, who should be both God and Man; or if by

<P><HI>3dly,</HI> But yet we ought not universally to confine this Faith of Christ (as without us or within us) to the narrow bounds of outward Preaching it, either by the Prophets in their Day, or to the Evangelists and Apostles in their Day, or to the hearing or reading of the holy Scriptures, or to the outward Ministry of Angels of Men, well knowing and believing, That as God gave it to our first Parents with∣out all Ministry of Men, and as he gave it to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> &amp; to the three <HI>Wise Men,</HI> that came from the East, to worship Jesus in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> so he hath given it to many others, and can or may give it to as many as he pleaseth without all outward Ministry; yet I say, in Gods ordinary way he is pleased to give it by the Ministry of Preach∣ing, and for this cause he revealed it to the holy Prophets and Apostles, that by their Ministry and Writings, it might be made known to all Nations, for the Obedience of Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16. 26. and the said Do∣ctrine, as outwardly delivered by their Ministry, and as delivered by the Ministry of faithful men succeding them in the same Faith, God is pleased to bless with a New divine Visitation and Illumination of more Light and Grace, than was or is given to such where this Do∣ctrine is not outwardly preached, to bring them to the Obedience of that Faith. And to declare my Mind with all Plainness, As I can find no Faith in Christ in all the Scripture, but what hath always a respect to Christ as that great Offering and Sacrifice for sin without us, as well as to his inward and spiritual Presence and Appearance in us, ac∣cording to measure, teaching us and enabling us, to apply to us the benefit of his Death and Sufferings, Resurrection and Ascention, and Mediation for the Remission of our sins, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Eternal Salvation, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all Grace and Truth dwelt and still dwelleth in the Man Christ Jesus without us, and of whose Fullness we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more and more partake, who believe in him, and in God the Father through

him, and who pray to God in his Name, and Worship and Obey him, so I can own no other Faith but this, to be the true <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> that hath for its Object the <HI>Man Christ Jesus,</HI> our alone Mediator without us, in whom the Fullness dwelleth, as well as the measure of him inwardly revealed in us; and without this Faith in God the Father, and in the Man Christ Jesus without us, and in the Fullness that is in him, as the greatest and most principal Object of our Faith, I can own none to be true <HI>Christians,</HI> or Believers in Christ Jesus, who are the Children of God by the Free-woman, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from above, let their Pretentions be ever so great to Christ, as the Light in them. As for <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> his calling <HI>Socrates</HI> a Christian, <HI>Socrates</HI> might have had the Faith of Christ, according to the Substance of it, then but obscurely revealed, and so might <HI>Pythagoras</HI> and <HI>Hate,</HI> who conversed with <HI>Jews;</HI> for the least measure of the Light of Christ, in every true Christian, to whom the Gospel Day of Christ is dawned, doth most necessarily draw and lead the Soul's Faith, Love and Devotion to the Man Christ without them, and to God the Father, as dwelling in him most abundantly and gloriously, that so God out of Christ, our alone Mediator, may continually supply us, as out of a most rich Treasury and Store-house, with all new and fresh Supplies, Aids, and Assistances of his divine Grace, Light, Life and Spirit, to serve him acceptably, and to enjoy the indwelling of God the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit in our own Hearts and Vessels, daily more and more abundantly, as our Faith, Love and Devotion is thus daily and continually exercised upon him. Nor is there any real-danger, by so believing, or by so preaching, to draw the Minds of People from the Gift of Christ in them (this at most is but the Abuse or evil Use of this Doctrine, as the best of Doctrines have been and may be abused, which all ought to watch against) but in∣deed, the real, proper and necessary direct tendency of such Doctrine, rightly improved, is to bring People still more and more to the Gift of Christ in themselves, and to the more abundant enjoyment of him, as the Scripture Testimony, and the Experience of Thousands and ten Thousands do sufficiently confirm. But such who preach Faith only in the Light within, calling that Light Christ, as they have learned by hear-say or reading, and yet are ignorant of that great Mystery of Christ without us, they neither know Christ within, nor believe in him, as such; for though Christ the true Light, be in all

And such Preachers who say, (as some do, whom I have heard, to my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and sorrow) <HI>That men may be saved in Gods ordinary way,</HI> (as for Example, the <HI>Indians</HI> here in <HI>America,</HI> or any else-where) <HI>without the Faith of Christ, as he dyed for us, and rose again, by their honest and sober Living, according to the Requirings or Dictates of the Light in them, and that not only so as to witness a beginning, but a perfecting the work of</HI> Christianity <HI>and</HI> Salvation <HI>in them:</HI> They are not like to be at great pains, to preach Faith in <HI>Christ crucified</HI> and <HI>raised from the Dead,</HI> either to <HI>Indians</HI> or any others, or to encourage others to do it; for this Faith not being necessary, where or to whom it is not preached, the effectual way to make the Faith of it wholly an indifferent and unnecessary thing, is not at all to preach it, but bury it in Oblivion, as some would do, and so to bring our Posterity to be <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Hea∣thexs,</HI> and as it was almost quite buried and forgot by too many high Pretenders to the Light within. And if God in his infinite Mercy in these <HI>American</HI> Parts, (where we have but few Bibles, and very few other Books perused by many among us, that teach the necessity of this Faith) had not raised a Godly Zeal in some to revive and raise up this most precious and necessary Doctrine, concerning the Faith in Christ, both <HI>Without us,</HI> and <HI>Within us,</HI> the Faith and Re∣memembrance of it would have been (in probability) lost, in many Families, in a little time, especially it being rarely preached by many high Pretenders to the Light within; and if at any times mentioned by them, not held forth as the necessary Object of Faith, but rather
