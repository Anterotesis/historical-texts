<HEAD>General Rules to be observed in Roasting.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR fire must be made in proportion to the piece you are to dress; that is, if it be a little or thin piece, make a small brisk fire that it may be done quick and nice; but if a large joint▪ observe to lay a good fire to cake, and let it be always clear at the bot∣tom. Allowing a quarter of an hour for every pound of meat at a steady fire, your expectations will hardly ever fail, from a surloin of beef to a small joint: Nevertheless, I shall mention some few observations as to beef, mutton, lamb, veal, pork, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>To boil Asparagus.</HEAD>
<P>First cut the white ends off about six inches from the head, and scrape them from the green part downward very clean. As you scrape them, throw them into a pan of clean water; and after a little soaking, tie them up in small even bundles. When your water boils, put them in, and boil them up quick; but by over boiling they will lose their heads. Cut a slice of bread for a toast, and bake it brown on both sides. When your grass is done, take them up carefully; dip the toast in the asparagus water, and lay it in the

<HEAD>To boil Colliflowers.</HEAD>
<P>A colliflower is the most favorite plant in the kitchen-garden, amongst the generality of people. Take off all the green part, and cut the flower close at the bottom from the stalk: and if it be large or dirty, cut it into four quarters, that it may lay better in the pan, and be thoroughly cleansed. Let it soak an hour, if possible, in clean water; and then put it into boiling milk and water, (if you have any milk,) or water only, and skim the pan very well. When the flower or stalks left about it feel tender, it will be enough; but it must be taken up before it loses its crispness; for colliflower is good for nothing that boils till it becomes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uite soft.

<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To broil Beef Steaks, Mutton, or Pork Chops.</HEAD>
<P>SEASON the steak with a mixture of pep∣per and salt, and lay it on the grid-iron. Do not turn the steak till one side be enough; and when the other side has been turned a little while, a fine gravy will lie on the top of it; which you must take care to preserve; and list it all together with a pair of small tongs, or carefully with a knife and fork, into a hot dish, and put a little piece of butter un∣der it, which will help to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw out the gravy. Some palates like it with a shalot or two▪ or an onion, shed very fine in the dish or plate.</P>
<P>But if they be mutton or pork steaks, they must be turned quick on the gridiron.</P>
<P>The general sauce for steaks is horse-radish for beef; mustard for pork; and girkins pickled for mutton. But in the season, I would recommend a good sallad, or green cucumbers, or cellery for beef or mutton, and green peas for lamb steaks. All which sau∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are served up in saucers, or plates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> distinct from the meat.</P>

<HEAD>To make a white portable Soup.</HEAD>
<P>Take a leg of veal bone it, and take off all the skin and fat, take likewise two dozen of fowls, or chickens feet washed clean, and chopped to pieces; put all into a large stoving-pot, with three gallons of soft water, and let it stove gently, till the meat is so tender, as to separate. You must keep your pot tight covered, and a constant fire during the time of its stoving; in about seven or eight hours, try your jelly in a cup, and when quite cold, if it is so stiff, you cannot cut it with a knife, take it off, and strain it through a sieve, and take off all the fat and skum first with a spoon, and then with philtering paper: Provide China cups, and fill them with the clear jelly; set them in a gravy-pan or a large stew-pan of boiling water over a stove; in this water boil your jelly in the cups, till it is as thick as glue.
<PB N="84" REF="012348_0050_0F88F0403492E878"/>
After which, let them stand in the water till they are quite cold: Before you turn them out of your cups, run the edge of a knife round them, to loosen them; then turn them upon a piece of new flannel, which will draw out all the moisture gra∣dually. Turn them every six or eight hours, till they are perfectly dry, and like a piece of glue; keep them in as dry a place as you can, and in a little time they will be so dry, that you may carry them in your pocket, without the least inconveni∣ence. When you want to use it, take a piece about the bigness of a walnut, and pour a pint of boiling water on it, stirring it till it is dissolved; season it with salt to your taste, and you will have a bason of strong broth. If you want a dish of soup, boil vermicelli in water; then to a cake of your soup, pour a pint of water, so that four cakes will make two quarts; when it is thoroughly melted, set it over the fire just to simmer; pour it into the dish, put in thin slices of bread hardened before the fire, and the vermicelli upon them. Thus you have a dish of soup in about half an hour. Whilst this is doing, you may have any thing drest to follow, which will not only be a good addition to your dinner, but sav∣ing time.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> You must season it to your palate, as there is no salt, or seasoning of any kind in the preparation.</P>

When they are almost cold, run a knife round them, and turn them upon a piece of new flannel, to draw out all the moisture; in six or seven hours turn them, and do so till they are per∣fectly hard and dry; put them into stone jars, and keep them in a dry place.</P>
<P>This is very good for soups, sauces, or gravies. When you intend to make it into soup, shred and wash very clean what herbs you have to enrich it, as cellery, endive, charvil, leeks, lettice, or indeed what herbs
