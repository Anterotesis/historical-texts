and even to sixty Rods in Length, in some Places: Had they not been distinguished on the Account of the aforesaid Uses, their uncom∣mon Colour, and ponderous Nature; they might have remained unnoticed to the End of Time. These Sands ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and disappear at different Seasons of the Year, they appear in the Summer and Autumn, and in a great Mea∣sure disappear in the Winter. They lie in the greatest Degree of Depth close in with the Upland, then fall away gradually towards the Sea, — know not whether there be any beyond Low-Water Mark.</P>
<P>I once thought these Sands were brought up by the Waves of the Sea, and then by the Agitation of the Sea in Storms, and by the great Hurry of Waters, were carried back again to the Sea; but am now fully convinced that this Conjecture was unphilosophical, and not founded on true Principles: As the Solution of that Phoenomenon did not then appear any Way interesting, my Thoughts were unattentive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or was I concerned whether my Conjecture was right or w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng, but I am now certain, that the black Particles of these Sands are Iron, well washed from all Impurity, and that they are derived from the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land Earth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, as also from other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands; I conclude so, for the following Reasons;</P>

<P>I formerly had an Interest in the Ore Bed in <HI>Salis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury,</HI> which I have sold; the other in <HI>New-Milford</HI> I still retain, but having com∣mitted it to the Care of one of my Sons settled in those Parts; I have in some Measure forgot the Proportions of Ore to Iron, but think I am not mistaken; and can correct afterwards if I find any Mistake.</P>
<P>When we dig thro' these Ore Sands, under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath we find a yel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow Substance, much resem∣bling what those who dig up the Bog Ore call the Mother of Iron, which they suppose to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bulum and Food of the growing Bed of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at it is I know not; possibly it may be the Cement which ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds the Particles of Iron t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gether, but is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in doing its Office b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the frequent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Particles of Iron, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ails to the Bottom whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009109_0008_1030FD635BE6EDD8"/>These Iron Particles are scattered in many Parts of the Earth, and carried forward by the Water from Rill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Brooks, from Brooks to Rivers, till they fall into the Sea, mingle with the Sand Ore, and add to the Quantity, or to some proper Bed. Travelling the Road with the Reverend Messrs. <HI>Ruggles</HI> and <HI>Todd,</HI> at the Bottom of an Hill which we had descended, while we were discoursing on this very Subject, we observed some Sand brought down by the Water, nigh a Brook, which it might probably reach the next Rain; on the Top of that Sand there was a thin Stratum of a blue Colour, we had nothing convenient to take off this Stra∣tum, but took up all together, brought it to my House, and dried it; there was three Penny Weight of Sand, from which we extracted with the artificial Magnet 15 Grains of Iron Particles, which were in Figure and Colour the same with the Sand Ore.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that as Iron is much hea∣vier than Water, so it must be contrary to the Laws of Gravitation to suppose Iron to be transported in Water: If we consider how Iron may be plated so thin as to swim in Water, and that these Particles of Iron are much less than Plates made by Hand, it is not strange they should swim.</P>
<P>As these Particles of Iron were on the Sur∣face of the Sand, so they must have floated on the Top of the Water by which they were con∣veyed; if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Particles of Iron were much
<PB N="8" REF="009109_0009_1030FD669410C3B8"/>
larger, the Velocity and rapid Motion of the Water might thrust them forward, as we see Gravel and even great Stones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbled forward by the Force of Water. Since this Observa∣tion was made, Persons that are curious and attentive, have seen frequently in the Roads and elsewhere, these Iron Particles.</P>
<P>From hence we may conclude the Usefulness of Water, not only in Vegetation, but also for Transportation of Bodies to the Place of their Destination; so what a Political Writer said of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that they were the grand Carriers of the World, may with greater Propriety be ap∣plied to Water. Water not only serves to bring together the Materials which form a Tree, or a Mine of Iron, but also unites them toge∣ther; it is the grand Cement or Bond of Union; take away Water from Wood and it will be∣come like Powder of Post, take away Water from common Stone and it become as Sand, extract it from Limestone (which as <HI>Borehaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> saith, yields the most Water, it will become Lime in fine Powder; so I suppose, if Water was taken from Bog or Rock Ore, it would become like this Iron Sand Ore.</P>
<P>Many Years past a Number of Proprietors in an Iron Work, being in Want of Iron Ore, heard of a great Quantity in an Island; they sent and found a large Bed of it, but the Water which had fed and maintained it being drawn away, or dried away, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ine was starved, become dry like an Honey Comb,
<PB N="9" REF="009109_0010_1030FD6B80AB2480"/>
when all the Cells are destitute of Honey, and therefore would yield no Iron.</P>
<P>I was also informed of another Iron Mine at <HI>Windsor,</HI> which was so richly fed with Water, fully impregnated with Iron Particles, that the Ore being taken away, the vacant Bed in a Number of Years was replenished with a new Stock fit for Use. It is consistent with Reason to suppose, that as it is with Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, so it is with Iron, which is a component Part of the Earth; that there was at first, just such a Proportion and Quantity created, which is never more nor less, and hath so continued from the Beginning, and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the End of Time. The Fire dispersed in all Parts of the World, is gathered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd collected into one or many Places, and is increased ac∣cording to the Proportion of Fuel, where it is put in Motion; which is vulgarly called a Fire. It is as easy to strike Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with Flint and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>el, or if you have Wood, to kindle a Fire in <HI>Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣land,</HI> as in <HI>Persia,</HI> or the hottest Part of the World.</P>
<P>Water which is raised from the Seas, Lakes, Ponds and Rivers, and carried in Clouds over the Land, is let fall in Dews and Rains, and then returns by Rills, Brooks and Rivers, to the Places prepared to receive it; and as Water continues its circular Motion and Round, so I conceive it is with Iron; by the Water the Particles of Iron are carried to a proper Bed or Receptacle, thence it is taken and wrought for
<PB N="10" REF="009109_0011_1030FD6F1B1E0C10"/>
the Use of Man, and is worn out in his Service; or contracts a Rust and is consumed when it is worn away, as by the Earth in plowing, or from Horses Shoes in travelling, or from Iron Shod Wheels in carting, or by grinding with a grind Stone: The Iron by these Means, re∣duced again to fine Particles, and returns to the Earth again: When it is corrupted by Rust; this is much as when a Tree rots, or a Man dies, they Each return to Mother Earth again; these same Particles of Iron then worn away, are not annihillated or lost, but being joined with Sulphur, and those other Materials which constitute Iron Ore, it proceeds and takes the same Journey round till it comes to the Smith's Forge again: Under all these Changes and Revolutions there is no Addition; the same Quantity as there was at first, there remains the same still, and no more.</P>
<P>A Piece of Iron Ore was sent to me as a Curiosity from <HI>Salisbury,</HI> taken from the Ore Bed in that Place; it was in the Shape and Form of three Isicles, two or three Inches long, and join∣ed to a Body of Ore like Fingers to the Hand; Water impregnated with Particles of Iron, had ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down upon three Spires of Grass as Con∣ductory to the Mineral Water, the Water from Time to Time drying away, left the Iron Particles in the above said Form:—Which is a farther Evidence, that Iron in its pri∣mitive and original State, is in very small Particles, and are collected and brought toge∣ther

<P>Iron if considered either Mechanically or Medicinally, is the most useful Metal in the World▪ An Ax made of Iron and Steel is for all Mechanical Uses very much to be prefered to an Ax of Gold; Steel is only Iron diffe∣rently modified; if Amputation is to be per∣formed, the Surgeon and Patient would choose a Knife of Steel, rather than a Knife of Gold. In the Rebellion under <HI>Pizarro</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> they were obliged for want of Iron to Shoe their Horses with Silver, but it was but poor Stu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or that Use compared with Iron.</P>
<P>Medicinally used it is greatly preferable to other more costly Metals. There has been much said of <HI>Aurum Potabile,</HI> and of Preparati∣ons of Silver, but they are but splended Trifles compared with Preparations of Iron; but let the Preparation or Composition be what it will, whether a Water, a Powder, or a Salt, still it is Iron; these Preparations pass through the Body, and return again to their original State.</P>

<P>To trace the Matter therefore from the Be∣ginning; Some Years past viewing this black Sand, the present Subject of writing, with particular Attention, was very much of the Mind that the black Particles were Iron; if it had been tried with a Magnet and was not affected by it, it would not have alter'd my Resolution to try it if an Opportunity should present, having been credibly informed that

<P>My Son's Iron Works being erected as I said before; some Time last <HI>November</HI> I rode down to the Beach, where I found the black Sand had in a great Measure disappeared. I fil∣led my Saddle-Bags with the black Sand, which I gathered from the Surface of the red Sand, but the Chaffery was not then finished, and the Refinery not being fit for such a Purpose, the Trial could not be made, it was therefore necessarily suspended till the first Week in <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>The Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d being weighed, which was de∣signed to be used in the Trial, we desired the Workman to use his best Skill to see if he could make Iron from it: Against which, the Workman objected three Things.</P>

<P N="2">2<HI>d,</HI> That notwithstanding the Weight and Appearance of this Sand, he much doubted whether it contained Iron Ore or not.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d,</HI> He farther observed that if it were Iron Ore, it consisting of such very fine heavy Par∣ticles like Flesh without Bones, having nothing to sustain it, would run down among the Coals, sink to the Bottom, full too low, and conse∣quently never gather into a Mass and form a Loop.</P>
<P>This, I must confess, was a formidable Ob∣jection, a Difficulty which I had foreseen, and which we knew not how to obviate, otherwise then by adding to the Sand some Cinder or Slag, which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>owed from Pig Iron in the Working; notwithstanding this Difficulty, my Son and I were determined at all Events, that a Trial should be made. Besides the Exer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of Authority, we thought it best to engage the Workman to exert himself, and use his best Skill by motives of Honour and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, let him know the Importance of the U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dertaking; he being a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber Man, who would use strong Drink with Moderation and Tem∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, I promised him that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he could pro∣duce a Bar of Iron from that Sand, I would send him a Bottle of Rum.

<P>Some may say, that such trivial Stories, and a long Detail of minute Particulars concerning a little Bag of Sand and a Bar of Iron, is really below the Dignity of Writing. I do not know what such Persons intend, by Dignity of Writing, unless they can Mean, that when a Person is to write a Letter or a Book, he must ascend into the Clouds, think himself going about something quite different from the common Actions of Life: That he must divest him himself of that Sociability, that easy Freedom, that Familiarity which is so much the Support and Pleasure of Conversa∣tion; must now put on a distant and forbidding Air, assume a solemn Mein, a formal Stiffness, as if clad in Buckrum; and being thus equipt is in Appearance like a Hog in Armour, very different from the inimitable Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> who relates the common Incidents of Life, in such an easy agreeable Manner, as to engage the Attention, captivate the Mind, and excite the Admiration of every Reader.</P>

<P>It was a discouraging Circumstance that one third Part of the Sand was common Grit Sand, which is hard to Flux, and when it is melted runs into a kind of Glass▪ this dry hungry vitrous Matter being more likely to retard than promote the Flux of the Metal, whereas the true Cin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er or Slag greatly promotes the Design of reducing the Ore into Iron, and is as useful as the other is prejudicial▪ although this Grit Sand doth not prevent the Operation, yet I suppose it to be one Cause why it is so slow in melting.

<P>The third Week the Anvil gives Way, a large Breach is made; the greater Part of the Week is spent in cutting it down to make a new Face. This is the third Time the Anvil has failed in this Manner; and a new Hammer was broken to pieces and wholly spoiled not many Months past: I tell my Son that I think he must send to <HI>England</HI> for a new Sup∣ply, where I am informed those which are good may be had; so much Delay, Expence, and Disappointment, being the Consequence of trusting to those made of such bad Metal; what he hath in Use being an old second Hand Hammer.</P>
<P>About this Time, and for some Time past; having been at Work on a Parcel of Pig Iron, which is of such a sharp sulphureous Nature, as frequently to burn and destroy the Tew Irons, which is the Occasion of much Delay and Expence, as well as Loss of Time; at all Times, and with the best Pig Iron, there is Difficulty and Loss on this Score, though not equal to what it is when they Work those of a sharp Kind. A Tew Iron is a Case of Iron so framed, and of such a Constructure, as to secure the Bellows Pipes from being hurt by the Fire, and to convey and direct the Blast of Wind into the Fire; I have thought of various Expedients to re∣medy that Evil, have some Times thought of making them of the Asbestos or Cotton Stone,

<P>Some say that there are living Trees of this Kind; others say, that there was only one Log of it, which was discovered by an Endeavour to burn it out of the Way, it was found Impe∣netrable by Fire; some think that this in Fact▪ is the Case, and that it is All, or the greater Part chiped of, and carried away to shew as a Rarity; that it acquired this singular Pro∣perty by some Effluvia from the Earth; which is in Truth accounting for one Phaenomenon, by another as strange and unaccountable as the first; but let this be as it will, I have employed a young Student of the College, who travels

of Sand in its Passage to the Iron Works, being stayed for a Time in the Street, there falling a hower of Rain in the Night, look∣ing on it in the Morning, I observed that the Rain had driven away the common Sand, which is mixed with the Iron Sand, as being surprisingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighter than the Ore Sand, and had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Iron Sand like Cream on the Top; I rode down to the Beach, and found the Rain had done the same there, where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tratum of common Sand was thin: This Observation upon Matter of Fact, resolved two Things, which were Matter of Doubt and Difficulty: First, I learned that it was by Rain that the lighter common Sand was removed, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch being repeated, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>torms to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring up a new Accession of common Sand, the Sand Ore makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Appearance in its p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper Season.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Remedy may be found for this Evil or In∣convenience; the Sand contained in it, I sup∣pose to be an Obstruction. The Iron made of Sand Ore, is not only fit to answer all the or∣dinary Purposes for which Iron is used, but it seems to be well fitted for, and to have all the Qualities requisite for making Steel for Edge Tools.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> In the first Place, this Iron is soft; the popular or vulgar Notion is, that the hardest Iron is best for Steel; this I suppose to be a Mistake, founded on a Conjecture, that Steel is no other than Iron made hard; if this were the Case, a great Degree of Hardness in Iron would for∣ward the Operation; as this Iron is soft, so the heat and virtues of the Ingredients made use of in making the Change, will the more effectually Penetrate, in order to make a full Conversion of the Iron to Steel.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d,</HI> This Iron is pliant, or as we vulgarly say, tough. In Iron Bars there is a Grain, which runs the whole Length of the Bar, which is sometimes visible to the naked Eye; in breaking a very tough Bar of Iron, the Fibres appearing in some Measure resembling the Grain of Wood; the more distinct and connected these Fibres are, so much the more pliant and tough. If this be true in Fact, we see what is the Cause of the Pliancy or Toughness in Iron; I suppose it to be a necessary Property in Iron, to render it fit for making the best Steel for Edge-tools.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="26" REF="009109_0027_1030FDA65AEDD068"/>3<HI>d,</HI> Another Property of this Iron is, that the Grain is fine; The Particles o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grains of Gold are fine, and consequently connected, which is one Reason of its Ductility.</P>
<P>If I have any right Notion of the Manner in which Iron is cleansed or converted to Steel it is this; that when the Iron lies confined in the Store Chest or Box, the Heat and the Virtues of the Ingredients communicate, cut and divide these Fibres into Angles, resembling Diamond Point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Grains which go to constitute the Fibres or Filaments, are fine, so much the the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er will the Angles or Diamond Points be; and by how much the more Plian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Tough these Fibres or Filaments are, so much the stronger they will be, and the Angles into which they are divided; and consequently so much the better to cut, and bear force as in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and Stone Chisels, where Steel is put to the hardest Trial.</P>
<P>Iron when it is enclosed in the Chest is greatly expanded, as appears by the Blisters that rise on the Bar; this Expansion is the Cause of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch a strong Tension upon the Grain or Fila∣ments, as to snap them off Short; an hard Substance thus broken short, necessarily forms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to Angles, or Diamond Points; if the Change be not brought about in this Manner, I must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onfess I am not able to account for it at all.</P>
<P>It is said that the Edge of an Ax, Knife or Rasor, viewed through a Microscope, appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Saw; it is probable that this is a
<PB N="27" REF="009109_0028_1030FDA98C98ABA0"/>
true Representation, as the Edge is composed of a Row of these Angl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s or diamond Points; so that to speak strictly and philosophically, that which is cut is sawed asunder. As all Theory not founded upon Matter of Fact, and that is not the Result of Expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience, is vague and uncertain; therefore it is with great Diffi∣dence that I have offered any Thing in Way of Theory, which is only conjectural, and shall always take it as a Favour to be corrected and set right; for I suppose that the greatest Obstruction to the Increase of Knowledge is Pride and self-Sufficiency, I have learned many useful Things from the lowest of the People, not only in Rank, but in Understanding too. Most Men by their Observation and Experi∣ence arrive at the Knowledge of some thing not known to others, <HI>let each esteem Others better than themselves.</HI></P>
<P>One of the Ways in which Steel is prepared for medicinal Uses, is by apply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng a Bar of red hot Steel to a Roll of Brimstone, holding it over a Vessel of Water; the Steel will melt and fall down in Drops into the Water, the Water being poured off, and the Steel dried, in a metal Mortar it may be reduced to powder like prepared Coffee: This being Matter of Fact, I thought that there was Reason to con∣clude, that when Steel or Iron was too hard and touchy (as the Smith's say) would not bear the Hammer, it would break and fly to Pieces, especially when welding hot: With such
<PB N="28" REF="009109_0029_1030FDB00B0CBC40"/>
Stuff the black Smith spends his Time, his Coal, his Patience, and his Reputation with his Customers; he has paid his Money for it, therefore cannot afford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o lose it, goes on s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng to work it, but strives in vain▪ I sup∣pose that these bad Qualities in Steel and Iron, is owing to a too great Quantity or Proportion of Sulphur in its Composition.</P>
<P>Therefore in Order to resolve this Question, and to determine whether the Brittleness of Steel or Iron, be owing to an abounding of sulphu∣reous Particles, and for a Remedy at the same Time; from a Number of Bars of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Steel, I chose a Bar the most friable, touchy, and the worst I could find; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken, and that it might be better than I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I ordered the Smith to try it, and found it as bad as it was supposed to be, and full a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bad or worse than above described.</P>
<P>Having s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cked Lime in Readiness, I direc∣ted the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th to use this Lime as they use Clay, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve the Steel or Iron from burning, with this Alteration only, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should cast into the Fire more in Quantity, than what they use of Clay; and to give it a welding Heat; when it was taken out and hammered, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thick Scale from the Steel, which when broken was white within, occasioned by the Lime that was mixed with the Cinde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; the Effect was, that after this Operation, the Steel was malleable, and could be wrought very well in the common Way with Clay.
<PB N="29" REF="009109_0030_1030FDB1E573CC90"/>
The Steel being thus enclosed on all Sides w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th a thick Coat, the sulphureous Particles were ex∣tracted, or else consumed, something analogous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncaling.</P>
<P>I must confess that I made only this single Trial; it hath not been usual with me to pub∣lish or recommend any Thing upon one single Experiment: Some Smith's to whom I com∣municated the Method say, that they have tried it with success. As there hath been some Pig Iron made of such sulphureous Metal, as to be matter of Terror and Vexation to Refiners▪ it may be worth while to try this Method upon the Iron made of such bad Pig Iron; the Way is cheap, easy, and as I suppose harmless; if it prove a Cure of the ill Quality of such Iron, it may prove of considerable Advantage to the Publick. Intimations of this Kind, crude and imperfect, and not supported with repeated Experiments may at least give an Handle to further Improvements. The Iron made of Sand Ore seems to have no more Sulphur in its Composition than is in due Pro∣portion.</P>
<P>If I am mistaken as to the Cause of the Brit∣tleness of Steel and Iron, it is the Practice of melting Steel with Brimstone has led me astray; for when we see good malleable Steel in a Mo∣ment rendered as brittle as China Ware, only by mixing with the Steel, particles of Brimstone, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we think otherwise? To this it may be objected, that Iron when melted or fused by
