<HEAD>Signs of Apostacy LAMENTED.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DOST thou the Name of <HI>Christian</HI> Profess?</L>
<L>Then let some Signs appear in <HI>outward</HI> Dress;</L>
<L>Or else a sore Suspition thou dost leave,</L>
<L>That CHRIST indeed thy Soul did ne're receive:</L>
<L>So as of Him alone to make thy Choice,</L>
<L>In saddest Sorrows in Him to Rejoyce.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ART thou one of CHRIST's Sheep, where is the Mark?</L>
<L>Is that it on thy Head? it's very Dark; </L>
<L>It hardly will be own'd at the last Day,</L>
<L>But JESUS CHRIST unto all such will say,</L>
<L>Away be gone, be gone away from me,</L>
<L>I am displeas'd <HI>both</HI> with thy Garb <HI>and</HI> Thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET thy <HI>Attire</HI> be such in any case,</L>
<L>As may bear <HI>outward</HI> Signs of <HI>inward</HI> Grace;</L>
<L>Then sure those Signs some carry on their Head,</L>
<L>Do plainly show the inward Man is Dead.</L>
<L>LORD, pluck such Brands as these out of the Fire,</L>
<L>So we thy Rich Grace shall the more Admire,</L>
<L>And make us Blush, and be Asham'd that we</L>
<L>Should <HI>Glory</HI> in that, which our <HI>Shame</HI> should be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Word of GOD calls things by the right name,</L>
<L>So do not we, lest we our selves should blame:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="000633_0002_0FA95E909EAF6090"/>
Pride by the name of Decency we call,</L>
<L>Although to <HI>Adam</HI> it gave such a fall;</L>
<L>Which hath benumm'd our Senses, so that we</L>
<L>Remain stark Blind, till GOD doth make us see:</L>
<L>The greater is the Danger we are in,</L>
<L>By reason of that Toothsome Cursed Sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O WHAT a shame to <HI>Christians</HI> should this be,</L>
<L>That <HI>Sorcerers</HI> should so affected be,</L>
<L>As by <HI>Paul's</HI> Preaching from their Sins to turn,</L>
<L>And readily all their ill Books to burn?</L>
<L>O that our <HI>Top-knot</HI> wearers would do so,</L>
<L>Their foolish <HI>Baubles</HI> readily forego;</L>
<L>O what an Honour it would be to them,</L>
<L>In sight of GOD, and of all sober men?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN <HI>Perriwigs</HI> in Thrones and <HI>Pulpits</HI> get,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hairy Top-knots</HI> in high Seats are set;</L>
<L>Then may we Pray, have Mercy LORD on us,</L>
<L>That in <HI>New-England</HI> it should now be thus,</L>
<L>Which in time past a Land of Pray'r hath been,</L>
<L>But now is Pray'r turn'd out of Doors by Sin:</L>
<L>For <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> can't together dwell,</L>
<L><HI>One</HI> leads to Heaven, the <HI>other</HI> leads to Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ART thou a <HI>Christian,</HI> O then why dost wear</L>
<L>Upon thy Sacred Head, the filthy <HI>Hair</HI></L>
<L>Of some vile Wretch, by foul Disease that fell,</L>
<L>Whose Soul perhaps is burning now in Hell?</L>
<L>O therefore I do you most humbly pray,</L>
<L>Your monstrous <HI>Perriwigs</HI> cast quite away:</L>
<L>If JESUS CHRIST unto your Souls were sweet,</L>
<L>Those <HI>Toys on</HI> Head you'd trample under Feet,</L>
<L>And say to them with indignation,</L>
<L>As <HI>Ephraim</HI> to his Idols, be you gone;</L>
<L>We never will have more to do with you,</L>
<L>Lest GOD in's wrath out of his Land us spue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="000633_0003_0FA95E9169EE4C78"/>
<L>A TENDER Conscience a great Blessing is,</L>
<L>Sure willingly such will not do amiss;</L>
<L>But carefully will watch against all Sin,</L>
<L>In <HI>outward</HI> Man as well as Heart within:</L>
<L>Abstaining all appearances of Evil,</L>
<L>Lest they therein resemble should the Devil.</L>
<L>Many there are that say they do believe,</L>
<L>But they therein do but themselves deceive;</L>
<L>For Faith that's true will purifie the Heart,</L>
<L>And from the most beloved Sin will part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT Mercy is't, that GOD will chide and strike</L>
<L>His dearest Children; if they will walk like</L>
<L>The foolish World, who Lust and Pride do mind,</L>
<L>Reward thereof they in the end will find</L>
<L>Bitter to be, if on they yet do go,</L>
<L>Because Sin leads to final overthrow.</L>
<L>Then help us LORD to mend our way, that we</L>
<L>In Heart and Life may wholly turn to Thee;</L>
<L>And cast away our <HI>Foolish</HI> Fancies all,</L>
<L>Lest GOD in wrath take <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Crown</HI> and all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I AM amazed much to think how we,</L>
<L>Are backward gone from GOD, and cannot see</L>
<L>Who'ere allow themselves in <HI>one</HI> known Sin,</L>
<L>Satan hath got such safely in his Gin:</L>
<L>And if that their Repentance come too late,</L>
<L>All such will be shut out of Heavens Gate;</L>
<L>If you therefore this Gate would enter in,</L>
<L>You must be sure to fight against <HI>all</HI> Sin.</L>
<L>No <HI>Perriwig,</HI> or <HI>Hairy Top-knot</HI> spare,</L>
<L>Though they as dear as Eye or Right-hand are;</L>
<L>Else thou canst not with <HI>David say,</HI> Lord I</L>
<L>Have kept my self from <HI>mine</HI> Iniquity!</L>

<HEAD>A Caution to prevent Scandal.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A FALSE Report against thy Brother, thou</L>
<L>Shalt not take up, much less thy self allow</L>
<L>Him to defame, in Thought, in Deed, or Tongue:</L>
<L>GOD is a just Revenger of such Wrong.</L>
<L>And will <HI>again</HI> them pay in their own Coin,</L>
<L>Who <HI>thus</HI> their Brothers Credit do purloin;</L>
<L>And will on such his Righteous Sentence pass,</L>
<L>Which shall make them cry out, Woe and Alas!</L>
<L>That ever I my Brothers Name should tear,</L>
<L>Whom I in Love upon my Heart should bear!</L>
<L>As CHRIST my Saviour hath commanded me,</L>
<L>Whereby thou mayst know He hath Loved thee.</L>
<L>If thou dost not Love Him whom thou dost see,</L>
<L>How canst thou say in Heart thou Lovest me?</L>
<L>Which Love, O LORD, in me increase, that I,</L>
<L>Whilst I do Live, may longing be to Dye.</L>
