<HEAD>LECTURE I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. OF ELECTRICITY IN GENERAL, with some Account of its Discovery.</P>
<P N="2">II. Experiments, shewing that the electric Fire, commonly produced by the Friction of Glass, is not created by that Friction.</P>
<P N="3">III. That it is not extracted out of the Substance of the Glass.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That it is not collected from the Circum∣ambient Air: But,</P>
<P N="5">V. That it is attracted by the excited Glass from the Earth, by Means of intermediate <HI>conducting Matter;</HI> the whole Tarraqueous Globe, and every Thing thereon, possessing a large Portion of it, commonly called the <HI>natural Quantity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. That our Bodies contain enough of it at all Times, to set an House on Fire.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That it has, when in a State of Rest, <HI>no sensible Heat.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="4" REF="010027_0003_0F7BCD1C1BAF3C08"/>
VIII. That, by its violent Motion in passing through other Bodies, it produces a very <HI>intense</HI> Degree of <HI>Heat. Both these Propositions will be proved by a very accurate Thermometer, of a new Construction.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. That it is not the same with common or <HI>culinary</HI> Fire.</P>
<P N="10">X. That it will live or subsist in Water, as well as in any other Matter; and Sparks may be seen, and felt, rising out of cold Water, or even Ice, that will kindle up a burning Flame.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That it is an extremely subtle Fluid, passing thro' so dense a Body as Metal, with the greatest Facility; even more readily than through any other Matter we are acquainted with.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That some Bodies electrise <HI>positively,</HI> or increase the natural Quantities in Bodies ap∣proaching them, whilst others electrise <HI>nega∣tively,</HI> or diminish it.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That the same Body, under different Circumstances, may be made to electrise both <HI>positively</HI> and <HI>negatively.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. That the electric Fire is a simple Homo∣gine Body, and not of two distinct Kinds, as some have imagined.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="5" REF="010027_0003_0F7BCD1C1BAF3C08"/>
XV. That Bodies, having only their na<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Quantity, neither attract nor repel each o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></P>
<P N="16">XVI. That Bodies, having their natural Quan∣tity equally encreased or diminished, se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mutually to repel each other.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That this is not a real Repulsion, but apparent only; there being no Repulsion be∣tween electrised Bodies.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That Bodies having different Quanti∣ties, in Proportion to their Magnitudes, attract each other; and the greater the Dif∣ference, the stronger the attraction.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That different Quantities, in separate Bodies, may be reduced to an Equality, by Means of Metal, in the Form of a slender sharp Point, more readily, and at a greater Distance, than in any other Form.</P>
<P N="20">XX. A surprizing Property of an electric At∣mosphere, whereby Bodies may be electrised, both <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus,</HI> by the same Glass, and same Friction.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. An artificial Spider, animated by the electric Fire, so as to act like a live one.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. A new Property discovered in electrised Points, by Means of which will be exhibited a Sort of electrical Horse-Race.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="6" REF="010027_0004_0F7BCD1D9620FE48"/>
XXIII. A Shower of electrised Sand, whereby one of the Phaenomena of Thunder-Storms is explained.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Electrised Money, which scarce any one will take when offer'd.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. The Salute repulsed, or Fire darting from a Lady's Lips or Cheek, so that she may defy any Gentleman to salute her.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. Spirits kindled by Fire darting from Ladies Eyes, (without a Metaphor.)</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. A diverting Experiment, which can∣not well be understood, but by those who try it.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. A Battery of seven Guns, fired by a Spark issuing from a Person's Finger.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. A Description and Explanation of the fa∣mous <HI>Leyden Experiment</HI> or <HI>electrised Phial,</HI> which is the Foundation of most of the Improvements, which have since been made in Electricity.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="010027_0004_0F7BCD1D9620FE48"/>
II. An <HI>empty</HI> Bottle performing the <HI>Leyden Ex∣periment,</HI> without having any non-electric Matter communicating with its inner Sur∣face.</P>
<P N="3">III. The amazing Force of the electric Fire, shewn by its passing thro' a Number of Bodies at the same Time.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The electric Fire shewn to be the same with Lightning, from the Simularity of Ap∣pearance.</P>
<P N="5">V. A bright Flash of real Lightning darting from a painted Cloud, so as to give the most beautiful and natural Representation of a real Thunder-Storm.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Cause and Effects of Lightning ex∣plain'd.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The electric Element shewn to be real Lightning, from the Simularity of its Effects in tearing and rending Bodies thro' which it passes.</P>
<P N="8">VIII.—In the instantaneous Destruction of Animal Life.</P>
<P N="9-10">IX&amp;X.—In melting Metal in the Twink∣ling of an Eye, with the most intense Degree of Heat.</P>
<P N="11">XI. An Experiment, shewing why Thunder Clouds float lower in the Air than other Clouds do; and why Eminences are most frequently struck by Lightning.</P>
<P N="12">XII.—Why we have Thunder more fre∣quent in Summer than in Winter.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="8" REF="010027_0005_0F7BCD1DA1086008"/>
XIII. An Experiment, shewing how to avert the Course of a Flash of Lightning from Buildings, Ships, &amp;c. so as to prevent it from doing them the least Damage.</P>
<P N="14">XIV.—Shewing what Part of a House or Chamber, not properly secured against Light∣ning, is safe to remain in during a Gust, or in Case the House should be struck by Light∣ning.</P>
<P N="15">XV.—Shewing a probable Method of in∣tirely preventing the impending Stroke of Lightning.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The endeavouring to guard against Light∣ning in the Manner proposed, shown not to be chargeable with Presumption, nor incon∣sistent with any of the Principles of natural or revealed Religion.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The Manner of erecting an Apparatus in Houses for making Experiments on the Positive and Negative State of the electric Fluid in the Clouds in Thunder Storms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shewn by an Experiment, with an exact Re∣presentation in Minature, of such an Appa∣ratus.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A Battery of seven Guns, fired by a Spark, passing through cold Water.</P>
