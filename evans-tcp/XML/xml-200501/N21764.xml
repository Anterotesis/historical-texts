<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roposed by the Author, about two years ago, to be published by Subscription; entitled,
"Th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Young Mill-wright and Miller's Guide,"
—At the price of one Dollar and an half; met with the expected encourage∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ong as the Subscription was kept open: But, reflecting on the uncertainty, to what length an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> work of this kind might run, he ceased to admit Subscriptions; until he should be better able, from its actual <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Plates to be engraved, to estimate the real expence of the Publication. This being now done, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thor finds it necessary to add half a Dollar to the proposed price; which, he flatters himself, his former Subscribers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> too much, his Work, from the accession of new matter, and extension of the old, being nearly do<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bled in size, and consequently will be nearly doubled in the Expence of publication</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with the advice of men, well informed in the Branches on which he treats, submits the product of many years study and reflection, and of two years of actual application to the Work, to the Generosity and public Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ymen.—Conceiving from the narrow Sale of Scientific Works, that without the aid of Subscription, A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hors are seldom indemnified, especially if the Expence of publication be enhanced by Engravings: And he hopes such <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is not improperly asked, as he does not know of any correspondent Treatise extant, in the English, o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny other language.</P>
<P>From the following sketch of the Design, and from the matter treated of, a Judgment may be formed of its pretensions to public Utility, and consequently, whether it merits public Encouragement.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="proposed outline">
<HEAD>THE DESIGN O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> THE WORK—is</HEAD>
<P N="1">1st.

<P>And here it will be attempted to shew, the several defects and mistakes, of some established Theories, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> besides leading to error in Practice, produce useless Expense, and to substitute some new principles better agree¦ing with experiment and practice.</P>
<P N="2">2d. To simplify the rules for applying the Theories to practice, in ascertaining the power of water on all the ap∣proved constructions of Wheels, according to the given quantity, and fall from one foot to thirty-six, in proportioni<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Mill-stone, to the power of the Mill-seat, and in proportioning the Gears to the motion of the Water-w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> communicating the proper motion to the Mill-stone, or other parts of the Mill-system.</P>
<P N="3">3d. From these again, to form a set of Tables, wherein those not much used <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lculation, will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the relative, proportions of the Mill-wheels, suited to the given falls of water, as before mentioned; and also, of the Mill-stones, to the power of the Seat.</P>
<P N="4">4th. To describe and give directions, for erecting and using all the Author's late improvements in Mill-work, tending to lessen labour, and consequently Expence, and to perfect the Manufacture of Flour.</P>
<P N="5">5th. To explain the art of Manufacturing Flour in all its parts, as at present understood, and practised by the most ingenious and skillful Millers.</P>
<P N="6">6th. To give from <HI>Thomas Ellicot,</HI> Millright<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Whose noted genius and abilities, and long experience of</HI> 38 <HI>years practice, in building Mills, and draughting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>s for others to build by, cannot fail in rendering this part of the Work useful.</HI></NOTE>, the exact demensions of wheels, and the parts dependent on them of a compleat flour mill; and also, directions for their construction.</P>
