<HEAD>PHILADELPHIA SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very imperfect state of AMERICAN Husbandry in general, compared with that of some countries in Europe, is too well known to be controverted.</P>
<P>It was a conviction of our great inferiority, in this respect, which gave rise to the present Society, formed after the example of institutions in Europe, whose laudable endeavours to promote the Agri∣culture of their several countries, have been re∣warded with the happiest effects. And here it may be observed that, the difficulties those societies had originally to overcome, were much greater than what we shall have to contend with: they found Husbandry, generally, in a rude and unprofitable state, and had to recommend im∣provements from single instances of more skilful and fortunate management, until the whole, from
<PB N="4" REF="019193_0003_0FAA5F66909C0F58"/>
the force of imitation, gradually became more perfect.—But we, instead of solitary examples of extraordinary and successful conduct amongst our∣selves, may have the established practice of entire nations to hold up, as an encouragement, which we purpose to lay before the public, from time to time.</P>
<P>The Husbandry of this country, and of England, were fifty years ago both imperfect, and perhaps nearly alike;—here it has ever since remained nearly stationary, there it has been continually advancing:—A short parallel, drawn between them in their present state, will shew how far they are now apart.</P>
<P><HI>American Method:</HI>—Unproductive fallows pre∣cede crops; after crops, the land is generally given up for a number of years to weeds and poor natural grasses, until it shall come into heart again; the husbandman, in the mean while, employing his labours upon his other fields in succession.</P>
<P><HI>English Method,</HI> with variations arising from soils and circumstances:—A field, when broken up, is manured with all the husbandman's force,
<PB N="5" REF="019193_0004_0FAA5F6977893D48"/>
and what is called a fallow crop taken off, that is such a crop as requires the frequent use of the plough or the hoe, as in turnips, potatoes, beans, &amp;c. the land is then laid down in some kind of grain and clover, the last continuing sometimes two or three years, which is succeeded by wheat upon a single ploughing.—This course, or rotation of crops, is then renewed in the same order, the land never being idle or resting, as it is called.</P>
<P>This new practice is allowed to possess many advantages over the old, which is almost entirely renounced in England, but retained in America.</P>
<P>The manures used in the first instance, are applied to produce the best possible effect;—they go to benefit the whole course, be it for four or five years.—</P>
<P>The land is made perfectly mellow, and clean before it is laid down to grass, or sowed with grain; it being an established maxim, never to do either, until the earth is well pulverised, and its natural weeds, and those arising from the dung, fully extirpated by repeated plowings.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019193_0005_0FAA5F6A5F9D0C50"/>The land is neither hardened by rest, nor ex∣hausted by rank weeds, which impoverish as much as a crop.</P>
<P>A greater abundance of grass, and other food for cattle, is obtained; more stock maintained, more dung made, and the whole products much greater.</P>
<P>The labour in such a course or rotation, though it requires considerable accuracy, does not follow so close, is not so hurried, and upon the whole not so great as in the former management.</P>
<P>And lastly; less land may be employed in culture.—</P>
<P>In this system, we shall remark that, wheat for instance, is produced on the same field but once during the whole course; but, skilful farmers so distribute their business, as to have one of their fields every year in wheat, and so of the other articles of crop—and of clover, which is supposed to last two years, of consequence two fields.</P>
<P>As more of art and contrivance, suggested by necessity and long experience, is manifested in the
<PB N="7" REF="019193_0006_0FAA5F6C1540D778"/>
rural affairs of that country, than in our own,—it should not surprise us that the management of their farm-yards is orderly and systematic; to which are owing such prodigious accumulations of manures, as will enable the farmer in England to prosecute, to much greater extent and effect, his mode of Husbandry, than what can be attempted in America, until his oeconomy in this important article shall, by degrees, be introduced amongst us.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to lay down in a few words, the general principles of this management, which will be found as widely different from ours, as is the system of cropping.</P>
<P>The barn, cattle-houses, sheds, stacks, &amp;c. are so disposed round the farm-yard, as to afford the best winter shelter for live stock.</P>
<P>No cattle are suffered to run out between No∣vember and May, but are all shut up and fed in the farm-yard—foddering in the fields occasioning great waste; and dung not lying there in sufficient heaps to produce fermentation, being thought of little account in manuring.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019193_0007_0FAA5F6C89DDA280"/>To the farm-yard is brought, the whole straw of the farm, sometimes leaves, fern, &amp;c.—to be trampled on and converted into manure.</P>
<P>The yard is often bottomed with a layer of the richest earths that can be found, which is thrown up in the Spring, and mixed with the dung.</P>
<P>Societies abroad have proceeded by occasional communications of improved methods, and by honorary premiums given for experiments made. It is the design of this Society to tread in their steps; and they hope, they address themselves to a people sufficiently liberal to reject no practice they shall recommend, merely because it is new, or runs counter to former habits and prejudices;— they freely invite communications, upon all subjects comprehended within their extensive plan, and hope from their example to promote lesser institutions, of a similar nature, in different parts of the country amongst neighbours, each one exciting a spirit of improvement within its proper sphere.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019193_0008_0FAA5F6D444BEA20"/>A Summary of the Society's Constitution is subjoined; together with Premiums offered upon proposed subjects.—Some of the particulars con∣tending for premiums, require a length of time, a series of years, to ascertain them by experiment; others are already experienced by individuals, or may be within the year.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<HEAD><HI>SUMMARY</HI> of the <HI>CONSTITUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Society's attentions shall be confined to <HI>Agriculture and rural Affairs</HI>; especially for pro∣moting a greater increase of the products of land within the American states. The members are distinguished into <HI>Residing Members,</HI> or <HI>Members,</HI> and <HI>Honorary Members,</HI> (that is, <HI>Corresponding Members.</HI>) Members to be hereafter added, are to be elected out of such persons only as reside within a ready distance to attend the meetings at Philadelphia with convenience; and those are de∣fined to be only such as shall reside within ten miles of the said city, on either side of the Dela∣ware: All Members of Agricultural Societies in other states or countries, with whom the Society shall correspond, and all persons of this and other states or countries, who shall be elected for the pur∣pose
<PB N="10" REF="019193_0009_0FAA5F6DF8322B60"/>
by the Society, are to be <HI>Honorary</HI> (or <HI>corre∣sponding) Members,</HI> and will be invited to assist the Society, whenever they come to Philadelphia: Be∣sides they will have a right to be present at the meet∣ings, without being invited.—<HI>Strangers,</HI> who have a propensity to Agriculture, and wish to attend, as Auditors, may be introduced by a Resident Member.—The Society will publish select col∣lections of memoirs and observations on subjects communicated to them. They will annually propose prizes, upon interesting subjects relative to actual experiments and improvements, and for the best pieces written on proposed subjects.— All claims for prizes are to be in writing; and when read, the Society will determine, upon every prize, which of the claims are most worthy to be selected for the definitive judgment on a future comparison of them: This judgment is to be given on the first Monday in February:—In the same meeting is to be determined the subjects to be proposed for prizes the next year; which will be announced in the public Newspapers. The Society will promote the establishment of other Agricultural Societies in the principal places in the country; the Members of these Societies will be
<PB N="11" REF="019193_0010_0FAA5F6EC7D8F8E0" MS="y"/>
requested to attend the meetings as often as they come to Philadelphia; and the friends of Agri∣culture are invited to assist the Society with inform∣ation of experiments and incidents in Husbandry. Premiums and prizes are equally due to persons residing in any of these states, according to the merit of their respective exhibitions. Honorary Members may be of any nation in the world.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PRIZES</HI> proposed by the <HI>SOCIETY</HI> in <HI>1786.</HI></HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. The Society believing that very important advantages would be derived from the general use of oxen, instead of horses, in husbandry and other services; and being desirous of facilitating their introduction into all these states; persuaded also, that the comparative value of oxen and cows must very much depend on the qualities of their sires and dams; and that by a careful attention to the subject, an improved breed may be obtained: They propose a gold medal for the best essay, founded in experience, on the breeding, feeding and management of cattle, for the purpose of rendering them most profitable for the dairy and for beef, and most docile and useful for the draught; and for the next best a silver medal: to be produced by the first of January 178<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>N. B. Among other things, the essay should notice the different breeds of cattle, and their comparative qualities; as their sizes, strength, facility in fattening, quantity of milk, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="15">15. It is a generally received opinion, that horses in a team travel much faster than oxen: yet some European writers on husbandry mention
<PB N="18" REF="019193_0017_0FAA5F7446035268"/>
many instances, in which it appeared, not only that oxen would plough as much ground as an equal number of horses; but also travel as fast with a <HI>loaded</HI> carriage; particularly when, instead of yokes and bows, they were geared in horse-harness, with such variations as were necessary to adapt it to their different shape. To ascertain the powers of oxen in these particulars, and the ex∣pence of maintaining them, the society deem matters of very great moment; and are therefore induced to offer a gold medal for the best set of experiments undertaken with that view; and for the next best, a silver medal. In relating these experiments, it will be proper to describe the age and size of the oxen, their plight, the kinds and quantities of their food, the occasions, manner and expence of shoeing them▪ in travelling, the kinds of carriages used and weight of their loads, the seasons of the year, and the length and quality of the roads; and in ploughing, the size and fashion of the plough, the quality of the soil, the depth of the furrows, and the quantities ploughed; and in every operation, the time expended, and number and sorts of hands employed in performing it; with any other circumstances which may more fully elucidate the subject. These experiments
<PB N="19" REF="019193_0018_0FAA5F74B5382158" MS="y"/>
will enable the essayist to determine what will be the best form and construction of yokes and bows, and what of ox harness, to enable oxen, with the best carriage of their bodies and heads, the most ease, and quickest step, to draw the heaviest loads; a description of each of which sort of gears, explained on mechanical principles, must be sub∣joined to the account of experiments: to be pro∣duced by the first day of January▪ 178<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P N="16">16. For the best method, within the power of common farmers, of recovering old <HI>gullied</HI> fields to a hearty state, and such uniformity, or even∣ness of surface, as will again render them fit for tillage; or, where the gullies are so deep and nu∣merous as to render such recovery impracticable, for the best method of improving them, by plant∣ing trees, or otherwise, so as to yield the improver a reasonable profit for his expences therein, found∣ed in experience, a gold medal; and for the next best, a silver medal: to be produced by the first of January, 1790.</P>
<P N="17">17. For the greatest quantity, not less than five hundred pounds weight of cheese, made on one farm in any of these states, equal i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess, rich∣ness
<PB N="20" REF="019193_0019_0FAA5F75A96FAE68" MS="y"/>
and flavour, to the Cheshire cheese usually imported from England, and which shall be pro∣duced to the society by the first day of January, 1788, a gold medal; and for the next greatest quantity, not less than two hundred and fifty pounds weight, of like quality, a silver medal. Besides which, the society engage to pay for the cheese so produced, at the rate of 10 per cent. more than the then current wholesale price at Phi∣ladelphia, of Cheshire cheese, of the same quality.</P>
<P>Note. All the prizes (or premiums) proposed last year, are continued; and in cases where the claims for prizes were to have been made by the 20th of December 1785, the time is prolonged to the 20th of December 1786.</P>
<P>Although the society reserve to themselves the power of giving, in every case, either one or the other of the prizes (or premiums) as the perform∣ance shall be adjudged to deserve, or of witholding both, if there be no merit; yet the candidates may be assured, that the society will always judge liberally of their several claims.</P>
