And although there are above Forty more Publick Preachers in this Province, who were not there, at that Time, I am satisfied, they would have heartily concurr'd with the rest, had the Op∣portunity been offered to them.</P>
<P>The Deserved Character which Persons of Worth and Eminency in <HI>London,</HI> who had the Happiness of an Acquaintance with Your <HI>Lordship,</HI> had given of You, made the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> who heard thereof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Your Arrival to Your Government here, would prove a rich Blessing to us all.

<P>God does sometimes pour signal Blessings on the Posterity of them, who have done signal Service for His Name.

For when he was, (and had been for a long time) through Bodily Infirmities, hardly able to set his Feet on the Ground, seeing his Nation in Danger, he earnestly pray'd, that God would strengthen him to appear in His Cause, and to Fight His Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els.

<HEAD>The Surest Way to the Greatest honour.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 Samuel II. 30.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>—The LORD GOD of Israel saith—Them that Honour me, I will Honour;—</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words were spoken in the Name of God, and by a Man of God unto <HI>Eli,</HI> who was an Honourable Person, be∣ing both the High Priest and the chief Judge in <HI>Israel,</HI> which were great Of∣fices both in Church and State. <HI>Eli</HI> was a Descendent from <HI>Ithamar,</HI> who was <HI>Aarons</HI> Se∣cond Son. How the High-Priesthood came to be Translated from the Family of <HI>Eleazar,</HI> who was the Elder Brother, to that of <HI>Ithamar,</HI> the Scripture no where informs us. It is probably conjectured, that the High Priests of <HI>Eleazars</HI> Family, had by some hainous crimes in the Dayes of the Judges, provoked God to lay 
<PB N="4" REF="000880_0010_0FAC963F2BFEB5E8"/>
them aside for several Generations. When <HI>Eli</HI> was advanced to this Dignity, the Lord promi∣sed to continue that Honour to him, and to his Posterity; but this Promise must be under∣stood as conditional, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> if they should acquit themselves in those Honourable Employments, as became them to do; but he and his, mise∣rably failing in their <HI>Duty,</HI> God did justly de∣prive them of their <HI>Dignity</HI> The reason of which Dispensation is mentioned in the words before us. For it is everlastingly true, that they who honour God, shall be honoured by him; and they that do otherwise, shall sooner or la∣ter be lightly esteemed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrinal Truth</HI> which may be insisted on from the words, as sutable to the present Occasion, and to the <HI>Honourable Assembly</HI> in this House Convened before the Lord, is,
<HI>That to Honour God is the surest and the only way to obtain Honour from Him.</HI></P>
<P>We shall only Enquire into two particulars, in order to the clearing of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What are the Characters of one that does Honour God;</HI> whereby we may judge whether we are such or no?</P>
<P N="2">2.<HI>What Honour it is that God will surely confer on such persons?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000880_0011_0FAC963FEF60FB88"/>Quest. 1. <HI>What are the Characters of one that does Honour God?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>He is one that does yield Universal Obedience to the Commandments of God.</HI> They <HI>that Honour me</HI> (saith the Lord, h. e. they that obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me. When in the Fifth Commandment, Children are required to Honour their Parents, this is a special thing intended, that they should obey all their lawful Commands. The Lord said to the Jews, <HI>If I am a Father, where is my Honour?</HI> Mal. 1. 6. <HI>i. e.</HI> the Obedience which is due unto me Kings are Honoured when their Laws are duly observed; so is the God and King Eternal, when his Laws are complied with. There is an Internal Obedience. For we are required to love, and Fear, and Delight, and Trust in God. And there is an External Obedience: When a mans words and out∣ward actions are as to the matter of them such as the Divine Law Enjoyns. There may be something of an External Obedience where that which is Internal is wanting▪ Mat. 15. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</HI> Whereas if a mans heart is set upon honouring God, that Internal Obe∣dience will discover it self in an Universal Conformity to the Law of God in outward acts of Obedience thereunto. The Commands of God may not any of them be disputed, but 
<PB N="6" REF="000880_0012_0FAC9640C2FFB340"/>
obeyed without any Reserve or Limitation. Suppose the Commandment to be never so difficult, &amp; never so contrary unto a mans own will and desires, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he knows that God com∣mands it, and has in him an heart that honours God, he will do the Commandment. When God Commanded <HI>Abraham</HI> to Sacrifice his on∣ly Son, he Rose early to do it. Gen. 22. 3. And by that high act of Obedience did greatly honour God: And so did <HI>Joshua.</HI> The Lord said to him, <HI>Have not I Commanded thee?</HI> Josh. 1. 9. And then he did as commanded though to the hazard of his li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. This Honour of ab∣solute Obedience is due to God alone. Inferi∣ours are to obey their Superiours, but with this Reserve alway▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far as shall consist with Obedience to the Will of God. If the Great∣est man on Earth command a thing which God has forbidden, he must not be obeyed. Although <HI>Nebuch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dnezzar</HI> was the Emperour of the World, and perhaps the greatest Monarch that ever lived; yet nevertheless, when he En∣joyned that which God had expresly prohibit∣ed, the three Princes who were his Captives told him plainly to his face that they would not obey him. <HI>Dan</HI> 3. 18 <HI>Be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not Serve thy gods, nor Wor∣ship the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den Image which thou hast set up.</HI> Or, if men should inhibit what God Commands, we must honour God by obeying him rather 
<PB N="7" REF="000880_0013_0FAC964161160FF0"/>
than them. Thus the Holy Apostles, when the Jewish Rulers straitly commanded them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey should not Preach Christ, they reply∣ed, <HI>we must obey God rather than men.</HI> Act. 5. 29.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Honourer of God is one that does Worship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Him only, and this according to his Will.</HI> The true Worshipper of God is one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him. It becomes the Greatest on Earth so to do. Psal. 29 1, 2. <HI>Give unto the Lord O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Mighty, give unto the Lord Glory and Strength; give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name, Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness.</HI> When we Worship God if we do it in the Beauty of Holiness, we give unto him the glory that is due unto his Name. As the neg∣lect of Divine Worship is a disrespect and di∣shonour put upon him Isa. 43. 23. <HI>Thou hast not honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed me with thy Sacrifices.</HI> So the due performance thereof is an honour to him. In Prayer we honour God. A King is honoured when his Subjects humbly kneel before him with their petitions; so is the King of Heaven. When we praise him then we honour him. God says, <HI>Whoso offereth praise glorifyeth me.</HI> Psal. 50. 23. when we give him Thanks, we give him glory. <HI>The Thanksgiving of many redounds to the Glory of God.</HI> 2 Cor. 4. 15. when we do with prepared hearts receive the Sacraments which are of Divine Appointment, we honour 
<PB N="8" REF="000880_0014_0FAC96422C4AF958"/>
the Author and Institutor of them. When we Sanctine the Lords Day, we honour him whose day it is. <HI>Isa.</HI> 58 13. <HI>If thou call the Sab∣bath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him.</HI> The man that honours God, has this Character belonging to him, he is constant in Prayer, consciencious in observ∣ing all Divine Institutions, and one that Re∣members the Sabbath Day to heep it Holy. Now that which we make an Object of Reli∣ous Worship, we put the highest honour upon that possibly can be. We own that which we Worship, to be the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief good, the first cause, and the last end of all. And therefore it is that God only may be Worshipped. Mat. 4. 10 <HI>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve:</HI> It is the highest dishonour to God that can be, to yield Religious Adorati∣on to any other Object besides Himself: For it is to make other things to be as good as He with whom none may be compared. Nor may we worship him in any other way, or by any other means then what Himself has ap∣pointed. To do so would be a great reflection on the Wisdom and Honour of the Glorious God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did not know how to prescribe means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for his own Worship; and therefore must be beholden to men for their Inventions. This was the Sin which the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> were guilty of in the Wilder∣ness; 
<PB N="9" REF="000880_0015_0FAC9642E97D3740"/>
they would worship the God which brought them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but by an Image of their own devising, whereby they incurred his high displeasure. The <HI>Jewish Doctors</HI> say, that <HI>God never visited their Nation with any Judgments; but he put in one Ounce of Vengeance for that Sin of their making the Calf in the Wil∣derness.</HI> This also was <HI>Jeroboa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Sin, when he sat up the Calves at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> and Or∣dained a Feast in that Month <HI>which he had de∣vised of his own heart.</HI> 1 King. 12 33. Nor do we honour God as we should do except we are duly careful as to the manner of Worship, that it be according to the will of God. Christ said, <HI>Take heed how you hear.</HI> Luk.8. 18. so we must take heed how we pray, and take heed how we come to Sacraments. God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped after a spiritual man∣ner. <HI>He seeketh such to worship him.</HI> Joh. 4. 23. because He is honoured by a Spiritual Worship, and by them who worship Him after a spiritu∣al manner. Men may as to the matter of Worship, and as to the means of Worship, do as the Law requireth, and yet displease and dishonour God by being careless as to the man∣ner of Worship. In <HI>Davids</HI> Time the Levites sought the Lord, nevertheless He made a breach upon them, <HI>for that they sought him not after the due order.</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. 13. In <HI>Hezekiaks</HI> Time <HI>they kept the Passover otherwise then was written,</HI> 
<PB N="10" REF="000880_0016_0FAC964516820620"/>
they were not cleansed as they that came into the Sanctuary ought to have been: for which cause many of the people fell under the Holy displeasure of God. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 3018, 19, 20. So the <HI>Corinthians</HI> because they approached to the Table of the Lord after an unprepared manner, were visited with a disease that proved mortal to some of them. They by such an unworthy manner of worship dishonoured God, and God lightly esteemed of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Honourer of God is one that ha's an Holy Zeal for His Name.</HI> A man that honours ano∣ther ha's a Zeal for him. He cannot bear it that the person whom he has an high value for should be abused. So he that honours God is greatly concerned at the injuries which are done to his Name. Psal. 69. 9. <HI>The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt those reproaches that were ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon the Name of God more sensibly than if they had fallen upon Himself. The Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> was a man that honoured God: And he was a Zeal∣ous man. <HI>I</HI> (said he) <HI>have been very Jealous for the Lord God of Hosts, for the Children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant, thrown down thy al∣ters, and slain the Prophets with the Sword.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King 19 10. Never man did honour God so much as the man Christ Jesus did, who never in all his Life did any thing but with a respect to his Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 
<PB N="11" REF="000880_0017_0FAC964529D17990"/>
Glory. Now his Holy Heart was always burn∣ing with Zeal for God. Therefore was it said of him, <HI>The Zeal of thy House has eaten me up.</HI> Joh. 2. 17. This Zeal which is the Character of one that honours God, discovers it self in two things especially.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aring a due Testimony against the Sins of men.</HI> When Gods Law is Transgressed, his Name is dishonoured. Rom 2. 23. <HI>Through break∣ing the Law dishonourest thou God?</HI> Therefore when those Transgressions are duely Testifyed against, He is honoured. A Minister that would honour God in his place, must faithfully reprove the sins of men, and spare none: They must cry aloud and spare not, and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up their Voice like a Trumpet shewing to the house of <HI>Jacob</HI> their sins. <HI>John Baptist</HI> did not spare <HI>Herod</HI> him∣self, notwithstanding his greatness, when he was known to be a vicious person. That his Faith∣fulness cost him his Life, and he was willing ra∣ther to loose his Life, than God should loose the honour due to his Name. If r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>proofs will not do, they that have Authority to punish Trans∣gressors are bound out of respect to the honour of God in that way to express their Love and Zeal for his Name. So did Christ shew his Zeal in punishing them that had profaned the Temple. When <HI>Phineas</HI> Executed Judgment on several filthy debauched persons, God was honoured and highly pleased with that his Zeal. 
<PB N="12" REF="000880_0018_0FAC9645E04BD668"/>
And so he was with the Zeal of <HI>Elija<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in causing the Priests of <HI>Baal</HI> to be slain. <HI>Elis</HI> sin for which the Lord did so severely threaten and punish him and his family was his want of Zeal. He is charged with honouring his Sons above God. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 29. For if he had punished them ac∣cording to their deser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they must have been Exposed to publick shame, but rather than such disgrace should come to them, he suffered them to make themselves vile and restrained them not. Indeed he reproved them, but notwithstanding they were his Sons, considering he was the Judge of the Land, he ought to have put them to death, because they were guilty of Crimes which the Law of God had made Capital.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Zeal discovers it self in promoving those things whereby God is Honoured,</HI> as well as in suppressing those things whereby He is dishonoured. If we promote the Establishment of the worship of God in the purity of it, we honour His Name. <HI>Hezekiah, Josiah,</HI> and other Refor∣ming Kings of Judah, manifested their Zeal not only in destroying Idolatry, but in settling the true worship of God according to his written word. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> that Excellent Governour of the Province of Judea, honoured God by the good deeds which he did for his House and for the Offices thereof. <HI>Neh.</HI> 13. 14. He that has an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nseigned Love for the House of God, has a Zeal for the honour of God. Psal. 26. 18.<HI>Lord, 
<PB N="13" REF="000880_0019_0FAC9648FA01CEC8"/>
I have Loved the habitation of thy House, the place where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honour dwells.</HI> The great God has many Temples, many spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ual House<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the Earth. Every particular Church consisting of a number of Believing Regenerate Souls, is an House of the Living God. To protect and en∣courage these Holy Churches is to honour God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Character of one that honours God, is that he does Reverence the Image of God wherever he seeth it.</HI> Now the Image of God is seen in two things especially.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that Authority and Dominion which he giveth to some over others. On this account man is said to be <HI>the Image and Glory of God.</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 7. The divine Image in man when first Created did consist partly in his dominion over the Creatures. Wherefore he that honours God will be afraid to speak evil of dignities, or to despise dominion, but he will make Con∣science to give honour to whom honour is due. That man who makes no Conscience of the fifth Commandment which requireth subjection unto Lawful Authority, does not honour but despise that God whose Image is seen in that Authority.

And very often it is so, that they who have been the greatest In∣struments of doing Service for God, shall at last be honoured with the Crown of Martyr∣dom, and so Honour God by their death (as <HI>Sampson</HI> did) more than ever they had done by their life. The Holy Prophets honoured God much by their Ministry; and we find in the Scripture that several of them honoured him by suffering &amp; dying for the Testimony which they had given to his Name &amp; Truth.

And when we live as Believers ought to do, when our Conversations in the World are as becometh the Gospel, we glorifie Christ. It is said of <HI>Titus</HI> and some others, that they were <HI>the Glory of Christ.</HI> 2 Cor. 8. 23. They lived such holy lives, that it was an honour to Christ to have such Servants.

The King of <HI>Moab</HI> said to <HI>Balaam, I thought to promote thee to great honour, but the Lord ha's kept you back from honour.</HI> Numb 24. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Notwithstanding the in∣tentions and inclinations of Kings, they shall promote no man to honour whom God is re∣solved to keep back from that honour. Nor is this so to be understood, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no man were by the Holy providence of God set in an honorable Station, but such as have honored God; for many Times the Vilest of men are exalted, and God does it not to honour them, but to punish a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul world by them. Before honour, goeth Humility. If a proud ambitious man obtains the honour which he ha's been aspiring after it is in Judgment to himself and others: but if an humble man ha's honour conferred on him, it is in mercy to the people concerned in him. And sometimes the Lord promotes his faithful Servants to honorable Stations as a reward for their Fid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity unto his Interest; which is in special the honour intended in the Text before us. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> was set in an honorable Station, and his posterit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had that honour continued to them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad they honoured God as they ought to have done.

were over their Cups they would sing them: but the reproaches and mockings of such men are an honour, and to be worn as a Crown. It is an honour and an happiness to be reviled and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>landered by such vile persons. Matth. 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>Blessed are you when men shall revile you, and shall say all manner of Evil of you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alsely for my sake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for great is your re∣ward, for so persecuted they the prophets.</HI> If it is for Christs sake, for our appearing in his cause or to maintain his Truth and Interest that we are reproached and slandered, we may wear those reproaches as our Crown for they are a part of our blessedness: Usually they that have honoured God most, have the honour to be most reproached by the wickedest men in the world. Who honoured God more than the Prophets and Apostles in their day? And who were ever more reviled? So the chief Refor∣mers in the last Century. <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> especially, no men were reproached more than they that had deserved better usage from the age wherein they lived. It is not a desirable thing for a man to be Cryed up by the generality of wicked men. Luk. 6. 26. <HI>We unto you when all men shall speak well of you: for so their Fathers did by the false Prophets.</HI> All the profane men in the Land would be ready to speak well of the false Prophets, because they would daub their Consciences with untempered Mortar. They

would say though you live in your sins, as long as you are called by the Name of the true God, and go to the Temple, and say your Prayers▪ you shall go to Heaven. There is no need of any such Repentance as the true Prophets say is necessary for your Salvation. Just as some un∣godly Preachers in these dayes say, if men call themselves Christians and are Baptised, there is no need of preaching Conversion to them. It is a sign that a man ha's not been so faithful to Gods Interest as he should have been, when the wickedest of men extol him. One having heard that a very vicious person commended him, was troubled at it, Alas (said he) <HI>quid ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> feci,</HI> what have I done amiss that so wicked a man should speak so well of me. So then a Reputa∣tion amongst such is no honour, nor desireable: but to have the love and respect of good men is desireable: therefore David prayed for that. Psal. 119. 79. <HI>Let those that fear thee, Turn unto me.</HI> And God did give him an Interest in their hearts. Verse 74. <HI>They that fear thee will be glad when they see me.</HI> Good men if they did but see David, they were glad: their hearts rejoyced to see that there was such a man yet living in the world. And this honour had the Governours in Israel who had generously ventured them∣selves in the cause of God and of his people. Wherefore the inspired <HI>Deborah</HI> said of them. Judg. 5. 9. <HI>My heart is toward the Governours of Israel.

h. e.</HI> I do in my heart love and honour them. And doubtless all the good people in the Land did so. And thus it was with <HI>Mordecai,</HI> out of respect to the Honour of God, he would not bow the knee to <HI>Haman. Haman</HI> was a Type of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and no question aspired af∣ter, &amp; expected a Religious Worship as <HI>Antichrist</HI> does, which <HI>Mordecai</HI> would not yield unto him: Now God did not only advance <HI>Mor∣decai</HI> to a very honourable Station, he was next to the King <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> but also gave him a great Reputation amongst his peo∣ple.

It was a principle and practice amongst the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> to chuse men into the <HI>Se∣nate,</HI> not for their Riches, but for their Virtue.

It is a great priviledge which you enjoy this day, that there can be no Civil Rulers over the Province (excepting the Commander in Chief, and his Deputy) but what the People by their <HI>Representatives</HI> shall approve of. No other Plantation enjoyes the like Priviledge. Nor should we, if the <HI>Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ija<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> amongst us could have had their desires. But since God and the King ha's granted us this fa∣vour, to make a right improvement of it, is the way to have it continued; that is to chuse such as will use their power for God: And they that have an heart to do so, will also seek the welfare of the People over whom God ha's let them, It is said, Prov. 39. 2. <HI>When the Right∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eous

If a Storm of Temptation happens, that the Inter∣est of the Publick, and their own personal are in Competi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, they will make the Pub∣lick give way to their personal Interest. It is related concerning that famous Emperor <HI>Constantius Clorus,</HI> (who dyed in <HI>England,</HI> then known by the Name of <HI>Britain</HI> only) that having in his Court many Christians, that so he might Try their Fidelity, he gave out, that such as would not renounce their Christianity should no longer be his Servants. Whereupon some who were only Christians in Name, but not in Sincerity, thinking to please the Emperor, declared, that they would renounce the Christian Name: which when they had done, Now (said he) I see what you are. You that will be false to your God, will never be faithful unto me, and therefore he banished them his Court. Well then, if you would have those to be over you, that will Conscientiously seek your good, choose them that will be sure to do as God would have them do. When God chose a Ruler for his People, He chose one that would <HI>fulfill all his will.</HI> Act 13.22. This ha's the Scripture recorded,

The <HI>Orat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> observes that the nature of man is desirous of honour. And the Gentiles by the light of nature knew that <HI>Vertue</HI> is the way to that which is truly to be accounted <HI>Honour.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> had a Temple which was called the Temple of Vertue, and another called the Temple of Honour. These were so built as that no man could pass into the latter, but through the former. God is so Gracious as to reward the Vertuous actions of moral Heathen. The justice of <HI>Aristides</HI> made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amous. <HI>Codrus &amp; Regulus</HI> because they preferred the safety of their Coun∣try above their own lives, were honoured in the world.

But what is that to the honour which God will give to them that are his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aithful Servants?

<P>There is one in this Assembly, a more hono∣rable Person than ever was seen in these Territo∣ries from the beginning unto this day. Many a prayer has been sent up to Heaven that God would send us a <HI>Governour,</HI> who should be a Rich Blessing to this his people. We have reason to hope that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as and will Answer those pray∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs in <HI>His Excellency's</HI> now arrival amongst us.

And one word let me speak for your Encouragement. There is not a <HI>Governour</HI> on the face of the Earth at this day, That has so many prayers going up to God for him every day, by a praying people who have an Interest in Hea∣ven, as your <HI>Excellency</HI> has; and these prayers will be a greater Mercy to you, and to your No∣ble Family, than all the <HI>Baronies</HI> or <HI>Earldoms</HI> in the whole world would ever be.

When I was in <HI>England</HI> above Seven years since, Solliciting the affairs of this People, His Majesty was graciously pleas∣ed to say to me, that <HI>He would willingly Countenanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Colledge in New-England, for that He knew many worthy Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estant Divine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had their Education there.</HI> And God has given us a Governour, who is ready to do any thing that we shall reasonably desire of him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> improve his Interest for us, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o we may have an happy Settlement and Establishment of that <HI>Academy</HI> in which the honour of God and the welfare of future as well as of the present Generation is concerned. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we neglect the present Opportunity, how shall we An∣swer it either to God, or to Posterity? Consider what I say, &amp; the Lord give you understanding in all things.</P>
<P>And let us all pray that God may be Honoured the whole world throughout, and this the more, because the day is certainly at hand, when God shall be honoured throughout all the Earth, more than ever yet ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been from the beginning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world, &amp; unto this day. The Time approach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when all the Kingdoms of this world shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ. Let us then Turn the Prediction of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into a Prayer, with which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conclude Psal. 86. 9. <HI>All Nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and Glorify thy Name.</HI> Amen.</P>
