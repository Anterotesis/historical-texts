<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs of this Province have appear'd to your Excellency of such Importance to the Well∣fare of the People here, that you have carefully apply'd your Thoughts to them, in which I hope your Excellency will have such Success, that not only the present Ge∣neration shall enjoy the Benefit of your Care, but our latest Posterity likewise may
<PB N="II" REF="002849_0003_0FE6765236B4D648"/>
bless your Memory under their Happiness, the Foundation of which may be laid un∣der your Excellency's Administration, if the People here, who's Interest is chiefly concern'd, do on their parts second your Endeavours, as their Duty requires, to∣wards securing the Peace and advancing the Prosperity of their Country.</P>
<P>The following Account of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> will show what Dangerous Neigh∣bours the <HI>Indians</HI> have been, what Pains a Neighbouring Colony (who's Interest is Opposit to ours) has taken to with∣draw their Affections from Us, and how dreadful the Consequences may be, if that Colony should succeed in their Designs, and therefore how much we ought to be on our Guard. If we only consider the Riches which a People, who have been and may again be our Enemies, receive from the <HI>Indian Trade</HI> (tho' we were under no apprehensions from the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves) it may be thought imprudent in Us to suffer such People to grow Rich and Powerful, while it is in our Power to prevent it, with much less Charge and
<PB N="III" REF="002849_0004_0FE6765798FABEB0"/>
Trouble than it is in theirs to accomplish their designs.</P>
<P>These Considerations are sufficient to make the <HI>Indian Affairs</HI> deserve the most serious Thoughts of the Governor of <HI>New-York.</HI> But I know your Excellency's Views are not confin'd to the Interest of your own Country only.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> are a poor Barbarous People, under the <HI>darkest Ignorance,</HI> and yet a <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>noble Genius</HI> shines thro' these <HI>black Clouds.</HI> None of the greatest <HI>Roman Hero's</HI> have discovered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Con∣tempt of Death than these <HI>Barbarians.</HI> have done, when <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> came in Competition: Indeed, I think our <HI>Indians</HI> have out-done the <HI>Romans</HI> in this particulars for some of the greatest <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> have Murder'd themselves to avoid Shame or Torments, <NOTE PLACE="foot">This will appear by several Instances in the second Part of this History.</NOTE> Whereas our <HI>Indians</HI> have refused to Dye meanly with the least Pain, when they thought their
<PB N="IV" REF="002849_0005_0FE67657C0A8A7C8"/>
Country's Hononr would be at stake, by it, but gave their Bodies willingly up to the most cruel Torments of their Enemies, to shew, that the <HI>Five Nations</HI> consisted of Men whose Courage and Resolution could not be shaken. They fully, however, these <HI>noble Vertues</HI> by that cruel Passion <HI>Revenge,</HI> which they think not only law∣ful, but Honourable to exert without Mercy on their Country's Enemies, and for this only they deserve the Name of <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>But what have we <HI>Christians</HI> done to make them better? Alas! we have reason to be ashamed, that these <HI>Infidels,</HI> by our Conversation and Neighbourhood, are become worse than they were before they knew us. Instead of <HI>Vertues</HI> we have only taught them <HI>Vices,</HI> that they were entirely free of before that time. The narrow Views of <HI>private Interest</HI> have occasioned this, and will occasion <HI>greater,</HI> even <HI>Publick Mischiefs,</HI> if the Governors of the People do not, like true Patriots, exert themselves, and put a stop to these growing Evils. If these Practices be
<PB N="V" REF="002849_0006_0FE6765A8C742BE0"/>
winked at, instead of <HI>faithful Friends</HI> that have Manfully fought our Battles for us, the <HI>Five Nations</HI> will become <HI>faithless Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers,</HI> and joyn with every Enemy that can give them the hopes of <HI>Plunder.</HI></P>
<P>If care were taken to plant in them, and cultivate that general Benevolence to Mankind, which is the true Principle of <HI>Vertue,</HI> it would effectually eradicate those <HI>horrid Vices</HI> occasioned by their <HI>Unbounded Revenge;</HI> and then the <HI>Five Nations</HI> would no longer deserve the Name of <HI>Barba∣rians,</HI> but would become a People whose <HI>Friendship</HI> might add <HI>Honour</HI> to the <HI>British Nation,</HI> tho' they be now too generally despised.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> &amp; <HI>Romans,</HI> once as much <HI>Bar∣barians</HI> as our <HI>Indians</HI> now are, dei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied the Hero's that first taught them the <HI>Vertues,</HI> from whence the Grandeur of those Re∣nowned Nations wholly proceeded; but a good Man will feel more real Satisfaction and Pleasure from the Sense of having any way forwarded the <HI>Civilizing</HI> of <HI>Barbar∣ous Nations,</HI> or of having <HI>Multiplied</HI> the
<PB N="VI" REF="002849_0007_0FE6765AB078D810"/>
<HI>Number of good Men,</HI> than from the fondest hopes of such <HI>extravagant Honour.</HI></P>
<P>These Considerations, I believe, would make your Excellency think a <HI>good History of the Five Nations</HI> worthy of your Pa∣tronage. As to this, I only hope, that you will look on my offering the follow∣ing Account, however meanly perform'd, to proceed from the Desire I have of making some Publick Profession of that Gratitude, which is so much the Duty of</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THough every one that is in the least acquainted with the Affairs of <HI>North-America,</HI> knows of what Consequence the <HI>Indians,</HI> commonly known to the People of <HI>New-York</HI> by the Name of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> are both in Peace and War, I know of no Accounts of them Published in <HI>English;</HI> but what are meer Translations of <HI>French</HI> Authors. This seems to throw some Reflection on the Inhabitants of this Province, as if we wanted Curiosity to enquire into our own Affairs, and that we were willing to rest satisfied with the Accounts the <HI>French</HI> give us of our own <HI>Indians,</HI> notwithstanding that the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada</HI> are always in a different Interest, and sometimes in open Ho∣stility with us. This Consideration, I hope, will justify my attempting to write an History of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> at this time; and my endeavouring to remove that Blame with which we may be charged; perhaps will at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one for many Faults which the want of Capacity may have occasioned.</P>
<P>Having had the Perusal of the Minutes of the <HI>Commissi∣oners for Indian Affairs,</HI> I have been enabled to collect many Materials for this History, which are not to be found any where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: And this Collection will, at least, be useful to any Person of more Capacity, who shall afterwards un∣dertake this Task. When a History of these Nations shall be well wrote, it will be of great use to all the <HI>British Colonies</HI> in <HI>North-America;</HI> for it may enable them to learn Experience at the Expence of others; and if I can contribute any thing to so good a Purpose, I shall not think my Labour lost.</P>
<P>It will be necessary to Excuse two things in the follow∣ing Performance, which, I am afraid, will be found fault with by those that are the best Judges. The <HI>First</HI> is, My
<PB N="VIII" REF="002849_0009_0FE6765DB7D79FB0"/>
filling up so great part of the Work with the Adventures of small Parties, and sometimes with those of one single Man. The <HI>Second</HI> is, The inserting so many Speeches at length. I must confess, that I have done both these designedly.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>First,</HI> The History of <HI>Indians</HI> would be very lame without an Account of these Private Adventures; for their War-like Expeditions are almost always carried on by Sur∣prizing each other, and their whole Art of War consists in managing small Parties. The whole Country being one continued Forrest, gives great Advantages to these Sculk∣ing Parties, and has obliged the <HI>Christians</HI> to imitate the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Method of making War. I believ'd like∣w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, that some would be curious to know the Manners and Customs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their Publick Treaties especially, who could not be satisfied without taking Notice of several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Circumstances, and some things otherwise of no Con∣sequence. We are fond of searching into Remote Anti∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, to know the Manners of our Earliest <HI>Progenitors:</HI> if I be not mistaken, the <HI>Indians</HI> are living Images of them.</P>
<P>My Design in the <HI>Second</HI> was, That thereby the Genius of the <HI>Indians</HI> might better appear. An Historian may paint Mens Actions in lively Colours, or in faint Shades, as he likes best, and in both cases preserve a perfect Like∣ness: But it will be a difficult Task to show the Wit, and Judgment, and Art, and Simplicity, and Ignorance of the several Parties, managing a Treaty, in other Words than their own. As to my part, I thought my self uncapable of doing it, without depriving the judicious Observer of the Oppor∣tunity of discovering much of the <HI>Indian Genius,</HI> by my Contracting or Paraphrasing their Harrangues, and without committing often gross Mistakes. For, on these Occa∣sions, a skillful Manager often talks Confusedly and Obscure∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with design; which if an Historian should endeavour to amend, the Reader would receive the History in a false Light.</P>
<P><PB N="IX" REF="002849_0010_0FE676607302E238"/>
The Reader will find a great Difference between some of the Speeches made at <HI>Albany,</HI> and those taken from the <HI>French</HI> Authors▪ The first are genuine, and truly related, as delivered by the Sworn Interpreters, and where Truth only is required; a rough Stile with it, is preferable to Eloquence without it. But I must own, that <HI>I</HI> suspect ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Interpreters may not have done Justice to the <HI>Indian Elo∣quence.</HI> For, the <HI>Indians</HI> having but few words, and few complex Ideas, use many Metaphors in their Discourse, which interpreted by an hesitating Tongue, may appear mean, and strike our Imagination faintly, but under the Pen of a skilful Interpreter may strongly move our Passions by their lively Images. I have heard an Old <HI>Indian Sa∣chem</HI> speak with much Vivacity and Elocution, so that the Speaker pleas'd and moved the Auditors with the manner of delivering his Discourse; which, however, as it came from the Interpreter, disappointed us in our Expectations. After the Speaker had employ'd a considerable time in Ha∣ranguing with much Elocution, the Interpreter often ex∣plained the whole by one single Sentence. I believe the Speaker in that time imbellished and coloured his Figures, that they might have their full force on the Imagination, while the Interpreter contented himself with the Sense, in as few words as it could be exprest.</P>
<P>He that first writes the History of Matters which are not generally known, ought to avoid, as much as possible, to make the Evidence of the Truth depend entirely on his own Veracity and Judgment: For this reason I have often related several Transactions in the Words of the Registers. When this is once done, he that shall write afterwards need not act with so much Caution.</P>
<P>The History of <HI>Indians</HI> well wrote, would give an agree∣able Amusement to many, every one might find something therein suited to his own Pallat; but even then, every Line would not please every Man; on the contrary, one with
<PB N="X" REF="002849_0011_0FE676609B8AFEB0"/>
praise what another condemns, and one desires to know what another thinks not worth the trouble of Reading: And therefore, I think, it is better to run the Risque of being sometimes Tedious, than to omit any thing that may be Useful.</P>
<P>I have sometimes thought that the Histories wrote with all the Delicacy of a fine Romance, are like <HI>French</HI> Dishes, more agreeable to the Pallat than the Stomach, and less wholsom than more common and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dyet.</P>
<P>An Historian's Views must be various and extensive, and the History of different People and different Ages, requires different Rules, and often different Abilities to write it: I hope, therefore, the Reader will receive this first At∣tempt of the kind, in this Country, with more than usually Favourable Allowances.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>New-York</HI> have been much more concern'd in the Transactions which followed the year 1688, than in those which preceeded that year. As it requires un∣common Courage and Resolution to engage willingly in the Wars of Cruel and Barbarous Enemies; I should be sorry to forget any that may deserve to be remembered by their Country with gratitude. The <HI>First Part</HI> of this Hi∣story going abroad by it self, may give those that have any <HI>Memoirs</HI> of their Friends who have distinguished them∣selves, an opportunity of Communicating them, and may thereby enable the Writer hereof to do some Justice to their Merit.</P>
<P>They likewise that are better acquainted with the <HI>Indian Affairs</HI> may, perhaps, find some Mistakes in what is now Published, and may know some things which I know not, if they will be so kind as to Communicate them, I shall gladly Amend and Insert them in what is to follow.</P>

<PB N="XIV" REF="002849_0015_0FE6766A96E13168"/>
<HEAD>A Short VIEW OF THE Form of Government OF THE FIVE NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to know something of the <HI>Form of Government</HI> of the People whose History one reads. A few words will serve to give the Reader a general Notion of that of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> because it still remains under Original Simplicity, free from those complicated Contrivances which have become necessary to those Nations where Deceit and Cunning have increased as much as their Knowledge and Wisdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> (as their Name denotes) consist of so many. Tribes or Nations joyn'd together by a League or Confederacy, like the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> without any Superiority of any one over the other. This Union has continued so long that the <HI>Christians</HI> know no∣thing of the Original of it.</P>
<P>They are known to the <HI>English</HI> under the
<PB N="XV" REF="002849_0016_0FE6766FA929BC28"/>
Names of <HI>Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnondagas, Cayugas</HI> and <HI>Sennekas;</HI> but it is probable that this Union at first consisted only of three Nations, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Mohawks, Onnondagas</HI> and <HI>Sennekas,</HI> and that the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> and <HI>Cayugas</HI> were afterwards adopted or received into this League; for the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> acknowledge the <HI>Mohawks</HI> to be their Fathers, as the <HI>Cayugas</HI> do the <HI>Sennekas</HI> to be theirs.</P>
<P>Each of the Nations are distinguished into 3 Tribes or Families, who distinguish themselves by three different sorts of Arms or Ensigns, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Tortoise,</HI> the <HI>Bear</HI> &amp; the <HI>Wolfe.</HI> The Sachems of these Families, when they sign any Publick Papers, put the Mark or Ensign of their Fa∣mily to it.</P>
<P>Each Nation is an absolute Republick by its self, govern'd in all Publick Affairs of War and Peace by the <HI>Sachems</HI> or <HI>Old Men,</HI> whose Au∣thority and Power is gain'd by and consists wholly in the Opinion the rest of the Nation have of their <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Imegrity.</HI> They never execute their Resolutions by Compulsion or Force upon any of their People. <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Esteem</HI> are their Principal Rewards, as <HI>Shame</HI> &amp; being <HI>Despised</HI> are their Punishments. They have certain Customs which they observe in their Publick Affairs with other Nations, and in their Private Affairs among themselves, which it is <HI>scandalous</HI> for any one not to observe,
<PB N="XVI" REF="002849_0017_0FE6766FCF2A04E0"/>
and draw after them publick or private <HI>Resent∣ment</HI> when they are broke.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Generals</HI> and <HI>Captains</HI> obtain their Au∣thority likewise by the general Opinion of their <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Conduct,</HI> and loose it by a <HI>Failure</HI> in those <HI>Vertues.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Great Men,</HI> both <HI>Sachems</HI> and <HI>Captains,</HI> are generally poorer than the common People, for they affect to give away and distribute all the <HI>Presents</HI> or <HI>Plunder</HI> they get in their Treaties or War, so as to leave nothing to themselves. If they should once be suspected of <HI>Selfishness,</HI> they would grow mean in the Opinion of their Country-men, and would consequently loose their Authority.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Affairs of Great Consequence,</HI> which concern all the Nations, are Transacted in a <HI>General Meeting</HI> of the <HI>Sachems</HI> of every Nation. These Conventions are generally held at <HI>On∣nondaga,</HI> which is nearly in the Center of all the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> But they have fixed upon <HI>Albany</HI> to be the Place for their <HI>Solemn Treaties</HI> with the <HI>English Colonies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tuscaroras,</HI> since the War they had with the People of <HI>Carolina,</HI> fled to the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and are now incorporated with them, so that they now properly consist of <HI>Six Nations</HI> (tho' they still retain the old Name among the <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI>) The <HI>Tuscaroras,</HI> since they came under the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> behave them∣selves
<PB N="XVII" REF="002849_0018_0FE67671E54A6300"/>
well, and remain peaceable and quiet By which may be seen the advantage of using the <HI>Indians</HI> well; and, I believe, if they were still better used, (as there is room enough to do it) the <HI>Indians</HI> would be proportionably more Useful to us.</P>
<P>As I am fond to think, that the present state of the <HI>Indian Nations</HI> exactly shows the <HI>most Ancient</HI> and <HI>Original Condition</HI> of almost every Nation; so I believe, here we may with more certainty see the <HI>Original Form of all Government,</HI> than in the most <HI>curious Speculations</HI> of the <HI>Learn∣ed;</HI> and that the <HI>Patriarchal,</HI> and other <HI>Schemes</HI> in <HI>Politicks</HI> are no better than <HI>Hypotheses</HI> in <HI>Phi∣losophy,</HI> and as prejudicial to real Knowledge.</P>
<P>I shall only add the Character which Mons. <HI>De la Poterie</HI> gives of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> in his History of <HI>North-America,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><Q>When one talks <HI>(says he)</HI> of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> they are thought, by a common Mistake, to be meer <HI>Barbarians,</HI> always thirsting after <HI>Human Blood;</HI> but their true Character is very different: They are the <HI>Fiercest</HI> and <HI>most Formidable People</HI> in <HI>North America,</HI> and at the same time as <HI>Po∣litick</HI> and <HI>Judicious</HI> as well can be conceiv'd. This appears from their Management of the Affairs which they Transact, not only with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> but likewise with almost all the <HI>Indian Nations</HI> of this vast Continent.</Q></P>

<P>THe first Account we have of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> who call themselves <HI>Rodinunch∣sioum,</HI> now commonly known by the
<PB N="2" REF="002849_0021_0FE6767891F5B7A0"/>
Name of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> (and by the <HI>French</HI> call'd <HI>Les Iroquois</HI>) was from the <HI>French,</HI> who settled <HI>Canada</HI> under Mr. <HI>Champlain,</HI> their first Governor, in the year 1603. six years before the <HI>Dutch</HI> settled <HI>New-York.</HI> When the <HI>French</HI> first arrived, they found the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> (by the <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Algonkins</HI>) at War with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> which, they tell us, was occasi∣oned in the following manner.</P>
<P><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>toire de L' Amerique sep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enrionale par Mr. de Bacqueville de la Potheric, Vol. 1. Lettre 11.</NOTE> The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> formerly lived about one hundred Leagues above <HI>Trois Rivier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> where now the <HI>Utawawas</HI> live; at that time they imploy'd themselves wholly in Hunting, and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> made Planting of Corn their whole business, by which means they be∣came useful to one another, and lived in Friend∣ship together, the <HI>Five Nations</HI> exchanging with the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> Corn for Venison. The <HI>Adiron∣dacks</HI> valued themselves, and their manner of living, as more Noble than that of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and despised them for that reason.</P>
<P>At last the Game began to be scarce with the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> they therefore desired that some of the young Men of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> might joyn with them, and assist them in their Hunting, which the <HI>Five Nations</HI> the more wil∣lingly
<PB N="3" REF="002849_0022_0FE67679C46749F0"/>
agreed to, in hopes that thereby their People might acquire skill in Hunting.</P>
<P>It has been a constant Custom among all the Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> to divide themselves into small Companies while they Hunt, and to divide likewise the Country among their several Parties, each having a space of 3 or four Miles Square alloted them, in which none of the o∣thers must pretend to Hunt; and if any Nation should encroach upon the Limits of another, in their hunting, they certainly draw a War upon themselves.</P>
<P>At this time the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> were obliged to spread themselves far, because of the scarcity of the Game, and each Party took some of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> along with them, who being less expert than the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> perform'd most of the Drudgery in their March. One of the Parties, which consisted of six <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> and as many of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> marched further than any of the rest, in hopes of the better Sport: They had, for a long time bad luck, so as to be obliged to live upon the Bark of Trees, and some Roots, which those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> scraped out of the ground, from under the Snow. This extremity obli∣ged the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> to part from those of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> each making a seperate Com∣pany; and after they had agreed on a Day to return to a Cabbin where both of them left
<PB N="4" REF="002849_0023_0FE67679EBF985C8"/>
their Baggage, each took his Quarter to hunt in: The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> were unlucky, and return'd first to the Cabbin, where not finding those of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> they did not doubt of their being dead of Hunger; but these young Men of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> were become dex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous with their Bows, and very cuning in approaching and surprizing their Game, which was chiefly owing to their being more patient and able to bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigues and Hardships than the <HI>Adiron∣dacks</HI> were, accordingly they soon arrived loaded with the flesh of Wild Cows. The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> could not believe that they were capable of such an Expedition, without being assisted by some of their Nations. However, the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> received them with pleasant Countenances, and congratulated them on their Success. Those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> made the other a Present of the best of their Venison: They eat together with much Civility, on both sides: But the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> becoming Jealous of this Success, conspired together, and in the Night time murdered all the six Men of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> while they slept. Next Morning the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> follow'd their Foot-steps, by which they had return'd to the Cabbin, and found the place where they had hunted, and much Venison which they had killed, which the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> dryed, and carried home along with them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002849_0024_0FE676818244EEC0"/>
The rest of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d after their Companions; The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> answered very cooly, that they parted soon after they had left home, and they knew not what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> become of them. But the People of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> being impatient to know something certain of their Companions, sent out several Parties in quest of them: They followed the Foot-steps of those Hunters, and found the six Dead Bodies, which the wild Beasts had dug up; and upon Examination found they had been Murdered. They made many Complaints to the Chiefs of the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> of the In∣humanity of this Murder, who contented themselves with blaming the Murderers, and ordering them to make some small Presents to the Relations of the murdered Persons, with∣out being apprehensive of the Resentment of the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> for they look'd upon them as men not capable of taking any Revenge.</P>
<P>Those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mother'd their Anger, and not being willing to trust themselves any longer with the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> they returned home to their own People, who then lived near <HI>Montreal</HI> on the Banks of <HI>St. Lawrence River.</HI> They gave an account of this Assassination to their Nation, who upon hearing it conceiv'd a vast Indignation against the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> who being advised of the secret movements of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olv'd to oblige them to submit
<PB N="6" REF="002849_0025_0FE67681A932C4A8"/>
to their Law, by force of Arms. The <HI>Five Nations</HI> apprehending their Power, retired to the Southward of <HI>Cadarackui Lake,</HI> where they now live, and defended themselves at first but faintly against the Vigorous Attack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>Adirondacks.</HI> But afterwards becoming more expert, and more used to War, they no only made a brave Defence, but likewise made themselves Masters of the great Lakes, and chased the <HI>Shawanons</HI> from thence.</P>
<P>While the two Nations were at War, the <HI>French</HI> arrived and settled in <HI>Canada,</HI> and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> having forced the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> to leave their own Country and retire towards <HI>Quebeck,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> thought themselves obliged to assist their New Allies, the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> without examining into the Reasons of the War.</P>
<P>Thus began a War and Hatred between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> which cost the <HI>French</HI> much Blood, and more than once had like to have occasioned the entire Destruction of their Colony. The War had driven the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> to <HI>Quebec,</HI> and the desire of Trad∣ing with the <HI>French,</HI> had drawn likewise all their Allies that way, who agreed with them joyntly, to make War against the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and to attack them in their <HI>own Country.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Champlain</HI> desiring to give his Allies Proof of his Love, and the Valour of the
<PB N="7" REF="002849_0026_0FE67682E7501640"/>
<HI>French Nation,</HI> put himself at the Head of a Body of <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> and passed with them into <HI>Corlars Lake,</HI> which from this time the <HI>French</HI> have called by Mr. <HI>Champlain'</HI>s name.</P>
<P>They had not long been in the Lake before they discover'd a Body of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> going to War. As soon as they saw each other, Shouts and Crys began on both Sides. Mr. <HI>Champlain</HI> made his men keep their Canoes at some distance; The <HI>Five Nations</HI> in the mean time landed, and began to intrench themselves, by cutting down the Trees round them; The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> stopt their Canoes near the Enemy, &amp; sent to offer them Battel, who answer'd, <HI>That they must stay till Morning, when both sides would have the Advantage of the Day Light:</HI> The night passed in Dancing and War <HI>S</HI>ongs, mixed with a thousand Reproaches against each other. Mr. <HI>Champlain</HI> had put some <HI>French</HI> in each Canoe, and order'd them not to show themselves, that their appearance might be the greater surprize to the Enemy, in the time of the Battel. As soon as day light appeared, the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anded, in order of Battel, &amp; the <HI>Five Nations</HI> to the Number of 200 Men marched out of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntrenchments, and put themselves in order, with three Captains in the Front, having large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lumes of Feathers on their Heads, and then advanced with a grave Air and slow Pace. The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> gave a great Shout and open'd
<PB N="8" REF="002849_0027_0FE6768311C5A6F0"/>
to the Right and Left, to give room for Mr. <HI>Champlain</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> to advance: This new Sight surprized the Enemy, and made them halt, to consider it, upon which the <HI>French</HI> firing, the three Captains were kill'd: This more surpriz'd the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> for they knew that their Captains had a kind of Cuirass made of pieces of Wood join'd together, that was Proof against Arrows, and they could not perceive in what manner the Wound was given by which they fell so suddenly. Then the <HI>Adi∣rondacks</HI> gave a terrible Shout, and attacked the Enemy, who received them bravely, but a second Volley from the <HI>French,</HI> put them into such Confusion (having never before seen fire Arms) that they immediately fled. The <HI>A∣dirondacks</HI> took twelve Prisoners, and as the Custom of the Indians is, burnt one of them alive, with great Cruelty; His Torment had continued much longer than it did, if Mr. <HI>Champlain</HI> had not in Compassion, &amp; abhorrence of such Barbarity, Shot the poor Wreth thro' the Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> having their Numbers thus very much encreased, and their fire Arms giving them new Confidence, proposed no∣thing less to themselves, than the entire De∣struction of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> by open Force; And upon this their Young Warriors became Fierce and Insolent, and could not be kept
<PB N="9" REF="002849_0028_0FE67688DD9EF260"/>
under any Discipline, Order or Subjection to their Chiefs or Captains, but upon all Occa∣sions rashly attacked the Enemy, who were oblig'd to keep themselves upon the Defensive, and to make up what they wanted in Force, by Stratagems, and a skillful management of the War. The Young Men of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> soon perceived the Advantages they gain'd by this Conduct, and every day grew more sub∣missive to their Captains, and diligent in ex∣ecuting any Enterprize, while the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> confiding in their Numbers and their fire Arms, thought of nothing but of Conquering by meer Force.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> sent out small Parties only, who meeting with great Numbers of the <HI>Adi∣rondacks,</HI> retired before them, with seeming Fear and Terror, while the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> pur∣sued them with Fury, and without thought, till they were cunningly drawn into Ambu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cades, where most of their men were kill'd, or taken Prisoners, with little or no loss to the <HI>Five Nations.</HI></P>
<P>By these means and their being frequently surpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> while they re∣main'd consident in their Number, the <HI>Adi∣rondacks</HI> wasted away, and their boldest Soldiers were almost entirely destroyed, while the Number of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> rather encr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased
<PB N="10" REF="002849_0029_0FE6768903792900"/>
by the Addition of the Prisoners which they took from the <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vanons.</HI></P>
<P>It has been a constant Maxim with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to save the Children and Young Men of the People they Conquer, to adopt them into their own Nation, and to educate them as their own Children, without Distinction; These young People soon forget their own Country and Nation; and by this Policy the <HI>Five Na∣tions</HI> make up the Losses which their Nation suffers by the People they loose in War. The wisest and best Soldiers of the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> when it was too late, discovered that they must imitate and learn the Art of War from those Enemies, that they at first Despised. Now five of their chief Captains end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour to perform by themselves singly, with Art and by Stratagem, what they could not perform by Force at the Head of their Armies; but they having no longer any hopes of Con∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring their Enemies, their thoughts were only set on Revenge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> had taken one of the chief Captains of the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> and had burnt him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This gave <HI>Piskaret,</HI> who was the chief Captain of the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> so deep a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the Difficulty or Danger of the most desperate Attempt made no Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣sion upon his Spirit, where he had the hope of Revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002849_0030_0FE6768B39D38338"/>
I shall give the Particulars of this from the <HI>French</HI> Accounts; for by it the nature of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the manner of their making War<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be more easily understood.</P>
<P><HI>Piskar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> with four other Captains, set out from <HI>Tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivieres</HI> in one Canoe, each being provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with three Fuz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. In two Days they reach'd <HI>Sorel River,</HI> where they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rceiv'd five Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> with ten Men in each. At first those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> be∣lieved that this Canoe was the van of some considerab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Party, and therefore went from it with all the force of their Paddl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. When th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y saw that after a considerable time, no others followed, they returned, and as soon as they came within call, they rais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their War∣Shout, which they call <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kue,</HI> and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Piskaret</HI> and his Fellows Surr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder.

each to chuse a Canoe, and level his shot between Wind and Water</P>
<P>As the Canoes approached, he made as if he had design'd to escape; and to prevent him, those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> seperated from each other with too much Precipitation, and Sur∣rounded him. The <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> the better to amuse the Enemy, sung their Death Song, as ready to surrender themselves, when every one suddenly took his Piece and fired upon the Canoes, which they Reiterated three times, with the Arms that lay ready. Those of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> were extreamly surpriz'd; for Fire Arms were still terrible to them, and they tum∣bled out of their Canoes, which immediately sunk. The <HI>Adirondacks</HI> knock't them all on the head in the Water, except some of the chiefs that they made Prisoners, who's Fate was as cruel as that of the <HI>Adirondack</HI> Captain, who had been burnt alive.</P>
<P><HI>Piskaret</HI> was so far from having his Revenge glutted with this Slaughter, and the cruel Torments with which he made his Prisoners dye, that it seem'd rather to give a keener edge to it; for he soon after attempted another ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣priz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in which the boldest of his Country-men dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not accompany him.</P>
<P>As he was well acquainted with the Country of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> he set out alone about the time that the Snow began to melt, with the
<PB N="13" REF="002849_0032_0FE67692F5B60000"/>
precaution of putting the hinder part of his Snow Shoes forward, that if any should hap∣pen upon his foot-steps, they might think that he was gone the contrary way; and for fur∣ther security went along a Ridge, where the Snow was melted, and where his foot-steps could not be discovered, but in a few places. When he found himself near one of the Vil∣lag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> he hid himself in a hollow Tree: In the Night he found out a Place nearer at hand, and more proper to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire into, for the execution of any Enterprize. He found four Piles of Wood standing close together, which the <HI>Indians</HI> had provided against the Winter and their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ie times, in the middle of which was a hollow place, in which he thought he could safely hide.

they were forced to return, after much useless fatigue. <HI>Piskaret</HI> quiet in the midst of his Ene∣mies waited with impatience for the Night.

<PB N="15" REF="002849_0034_0FE676946E8CA428"/>
<HI>Piskaret</HI> split his Scull with his Hatchet, but had not time to take his Scalp, for another man who watched at the other end of the Cabbin, raised the cry, and <HI>Piskaret</HI> fled. The whole Village immediately was in an Uproar, while he got off as fast as he could; Many pursued him, but as he was so swift as to run down the Wild Cows and the Deer, the pursuit gave him no great uneasiness; When he perceived they came near him, he would Halloe to them; to quicken their pace, then spring from them like a Buck. When he gain'd any distance he would loiter till they came near, then halloe, and fly. Thus he continued all day, with design to tire them out, with the hopes of over-taking him.</P>
<P>As they pursued only a single Man, five or six only of the Nimblest young Men con∣tinued the Chace, till being tired they were forced to rest in the Night, which when <HI>Pis∣karet</HI> observed, he hid himself near them in a hollow Tree. They had not time to take Vic∣tuals with them, and being wearied &amp; hungry, and not apprehending any Attack from a single Person that fled, they all soon fell a sleep. <HI>Pis∣karet</HI> observ'd them, fell upon them, kill'd them all, and carried away their <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">These are the Trophies of Victory which all the <HI>Indian Nations</HI> carry home with them, if they have time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scalp from the Skull of their Enemies, when they have killed them; and sometimes they are so Cruel as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scalp off, without killing them, or otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, but leave them in this miserable Condition with their Skull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Scalps.</P>

These Stories may seem incredible to many, but will not appear to be Improbable to those who know how extreamly Revengeful the <HI>Indians</HI> naturally are. That they every day un∣dertake the greatest Fatigues, the longest Jour∣neys, and the greatest Fatigues, the longest Jour∣neys, and the greatest Dangers, to gratifie that Devouring Passion, which seems to gnaw their Souls, and gives them no ease till it is satisfied. All Barbarous Nations have been observed to be Revengful and Cruel, the certain Conse∣quences of an unbounded Revenge, as the Curbing of these Passions is the happy Effect of being Civilized.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> are so much delighted with Stratagems in War, that no Superiority of their Force makes them neglect them. They amu∣sed therefore the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> and their Allies, the <HI>Quatoghies,</HI> (called by the <HI>French, Hurons</HI>) by sending to the <HI>French,</HI> and desiring Peace. The <HI>French</HI> desired them to receive some Priests among them, in hopes that these prudent Fathers would by some Art recon∣cile them to the <HI>French,</HI> and engage their Af∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ons. The <HI>Five Nations</HI> accepted the Offer, and some Jesuits went along with them. But
<PB N="17" REF="002849_0036_0FE67699799D1D70"/>
after they had the Jesuits in their Power, they used them only as Hostages, and by that means obliged the <HI>French</HI> to be Neuter, while they prepared to Attack the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> and <HI>Qua∣toghies,</HI> and accordingly entirely destroy'd the <HI>Quatoghies</HI> in a Battle fought within two Leagues of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> while the <HI>French</HI> dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not give their Allies any assistance.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>French</HI> Author says, That if the <HI>Five Nations</HI> had known the weakness of the <HI>French</HI> at that time, they might easily have de∣stroyed that Colony.</P>
<P>The Defeat of the <HI>Quatoghies</HI> struck Terror into all the Allies of the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> who were at that time very Numerous, because of the benefit of the <HI>French</HI> Trade, which they had by their means; for before that time the <HI>Indians</HI> had not any Iron Tool among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nipeceriniens,</HI> who then lived on the Banks of <HI>St. Laurence River,</HI> fled to the North-ward, in hopes that the extream Coldness of the Climate, and a barren Soil, would free them from the fear they had of the <HI>Five Na∣tions.</HI> The remainder of the <HI>Quatoghies</HI> fled with the <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awawas</HI> towards the Southwest∣ward, and for their greater Security settled in an Island, which the <HI>French</HI> still call by their Name, which being further than the Name of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> had at that time
<PB N="18" REF="002849_0037_0FE67699A12BB300"/>
reached, they thought themselves secure by the Distance of the Place.</P>
<P>This Expedition having succeeded so well, the <HI>Five Nations</HI> gave out, that they intended next Winter to visit <HI>Yonnondio</HI> (the name they give to the Governor of <HI>Canada.</HI>) These visits are always made with much Show. They gather'd together 1000 or 1200 Men, and passing over <HI>Corlaers Lake,</HI> they fell in with <HI>Nicolet River,</HI> where it falls into the South side of <HI>Lake St. Pierre</HI> in <HI>St. Laurence River,</HI> eight Leagues above <HI>Trois Rivieres;</HI> Six Scouts marched three Leagues before the Army, who met with <HI>Piskaret,</HI> as he return'd from Hunting, loaded with the Tongues of wild Cows. As they came near him, they sang their Song of Peace, and <HI>Piskaret</HI> tak∣ing them for A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>adors, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>topt, and sung his. It is probable that he having glutted his private Revenge, and his Nation having been long harassed with a Cruel War, he too greedily swallow'd the Bait: Peace be∣ing what he and all his Nation earnestly desir'd. He invited them therefore to go along with him to his Village, which was but two or three Leagues further: and as he went, he told them, that the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> were divided into two Bodies, one of which hunted on the North side of <HI>St. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aurence

River</HI> at <HI>Wabmache,</HI> three Leagues above <HI>Trois Rivieres,</HI> and the other at <HI>Nicolet.</HI> One of the Scouts had on purpose staid behind, this Man followed <HI>Piskaret,</HI> and coming up be∣hind him, knockt him on the Head with his Hatchet. Then they all returned to their Army with <HI>Piskaret's</HI> Head. The <HI>Five Nations</HI> immediately divided likewise into two Bodies, they surprized the <HI>Adirondacks,</HI> and cut them in pieces.</P>
<P>Thus the most War-like and Polite Nation of all the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>North-America</HI> was almost entirely Destroy'd by a People they at first despised, and by a War which their Pride and Injustice brought upon them. <HI>Immorality</HI> has ever ruin'd the Nations where it abounded, whether they were Civilized or Barbarians, as Justice and strict Discipline has made o∣thers Flourish and grow Powerful.</P>
<P>A very few <HI>Adirondacks</HI> now remain in some Villages near <HI>Quebeck,</HI> who still waste away and decay, by their drinking Strong Waters, tho' when the <HI>French</HI> first settled <HI>Quebeck,</HI> 1500 Men of them lived between that and <HI>Silleri,</HI> which are only a League distant, besides those that lived at <HI>Saguenay, Trots Rivieres,</HI> and some other places.

The <HI>Quatoghies</HI> and <HI>Utawawas</HI> soon began to be in want of the <HI>European</HI> Commoditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and their desire to make themselves conside∣rable among their new Friends, set them upon attempting to return to trade at <HI>Que∣beck,</HI> by which means the place of their re∣treat was discover'd to the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> who not having their Revenge satiated, so long as any of that Nation remain'd, resolved at all hazards to march through these vast un∣known Deserts, to satisfy their cruel Passion. The <HI>Quatoghies</HI> had the good Fortune to discover them time enough to make their Escape, and fled to the <HI>Putewatemies,</HI> who liv'd a days Journey further, where they and all the Neighbouring Nations secur'd themselves in a large Fort. The <HI>Five Nations</HI> followed, but being in want of Provisions, they could not attempt a Siege, and there∣fore propos'd a Treaty to the <HI>Putewatemies,</HI> which was accepted.

<P>This was the first time that the <HI>Five Nations</HI> had appear'd in those Parts, but their Name was become so Terrible, that the <HI>Chicktaghicks,</HI> notwithstanding of this Advantage, left their Country, and fled to the Nations that lived Westward, till the general Peace was settled by the <HI>French,</HI> and then they return'd to their own Country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Their Wars and Treaties of Peace with the French from 1665. to 1683. and their Affairs with New-York in that Time.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>june,</HI> 1665, Mons. <HI>de Trasi</HI> being Ap∣pointed Vice-Roy of <HI>America,</HI> arrived at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> after he had visited all the Islands in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and brought with him four Companies of Foot. In <HI>September</HI> of the same year Mr. <HI>Coursel</HI> arrived with the Commission of Governor General of <HI>Canada,</HI> with eleven Vessels, which transported a Regiment, and several Families, with all things necessary for the establishing of a Colony. The <HI>French</HI> Force being thus so considerably augmented, he re∣solved in the Winter to send out a Party against the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which by the Cold, and their not knowing the use of Snow-Shoes, suffered very much, without doing any thing against the Enemy.</P>
<P>This Party fell in with <HI>Schenectady,</HI> a small Town which <HI>Corlaer</HI> (a considerable Man among the <HI>Dutch</HI>) had then newly settled. When they appear'd near <HI>Schenectady</HI> they were almost kill'd with Cold and Hunger, and the <HI>Indians,</HI> who then were in that Village,
<PB N="23" REF="002849_0042_0FE676A618914A98"/>
had entirely finished their Ruin, if <HI>Corlaer,</HI> in Compassion of fellow <HI>Christians</HI>) had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontriv'd their escape. He had a mighty In∣fluence over the <HI>Indians,</HI> and it is from him that all the Governors of <HI>New-York</HI> are call'd <HI>Corlaer</HI> by the Indians to this Day, tho' he himself never was Governor. He perswaded the Indians that this was but a small Party of the <HI>French</HI> Army, come to amuse them, that the great Body was gone directly towards their Castles, and that it was necessary for them immediately to go in Defence of their Wives and Children: which they did. As soon as the Indians were gone, he sent to the <HI>French,</HI> and supply'd them with Provisions to carry them back. The <HI>French</HI> Governor, in order to Reward so signal a Service, invited <HI>Corlaer</HI> to <HI>Canada,</HI> and, no doubt, with design to make use of his Interest with the Indians in some Project, in favour of the <HI>French</HI> Colony; but as he went through the Lake (by the French call'd <HI>Champlain</HI>) his Canoe was Over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, and he drowned. From this Accident that Lake has ever since been call'd <HI>Corlaers Lake</HI> by the people of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Rock in this Lake, on which he Waves dash and fly up to a very great height, when the Wind bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws strong; the <HI>Indians</HI> fancy, that an Old <HI>Indian</HI> lives under this Rock, who has the Power of the Winds,
<PB N="24" REF="002849_0043_0FE676A641827D68"/>
and therefore as they pass this Rock in their Voyages through this Lake, they always throw a <HI>Pipe</HI> or some <HI>Tobacco,</HI> or something else to this Old <HI>Indian,</HI> and pray a favourable Wind. The <HI>English</HI> that often pass with them, sometimes laugh at them; but they are sure to be told of <HI>Corlaers Death</HI> with a grave air. <HI>Your great Country-man</HI> Corlaer (say they) <HI>as he passed by this Rock, jested at our Fathers making Presents to this Old</HI> Indian, <HI>and in derision turn'd up his Back-side towards the Rock, but this Affron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cost him his Life.</HI></P>
<P>But the next Spring the Vice-Roy and the Governor, with 28 Companies of Foot, and all the Inhabitants of the Colony, marched into the Country of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> with a de∣sign to destroy this Nation, which by the War not only prevented their Commerce with other Indians, but even prevented the Settlement of the Colony. This certainly was a bold At∣tempt, to march thus above 250 Leagues from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> through unknown Forre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts; but all they were able to do, was to burn some of their Villages, and to Murder some Old Men, that (like the Old <HI>Roman</HI> Senators) would rather dye than desert their Houses.</P>
<P>This Expedition. however, gave the <HI>Five Nations</HI> Apprehensions they had not before; for they never before that saw so great a Num∣ber of <HI>Europeans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> whose Fire-Arms were ex∣treamly
<PB N="25" REF="002849_0044_0FE676ADCE837440"/>
Terrible, and they therefore thought proper to send and beg a Peace, which was concluded in 1667.</P>
<P>But they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> naturally very Enter∣prizing and Haughty, a Party of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> met with a Party of the <HI>French</HI> a hunt∣ing, and quarrelled with them. The <HI>French</HI> Author does not inform us of the particu∣lars: But it seems the <HI>Indians</HI> had the Ad∣vantage, for they kill'd several of the <HI>French</HI> and carried one Prisoner into their own Country. Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>De Coursel</HI> sent to Threaten the <HI>Five Nations</HI> with War, if they did not deliver up these Murderers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> being at this time appre∣hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive of the <HI>French</HI> Power, sent <HI>Agariata,</HI> the Captain of the Company that did the Mischief, with forty others, to beg Peace; but Mr. <HI>Coursel</HI> was resolved to make an Example of <HI>Agariata.</HI> He therefore ordered him to be H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng'd, in the Presence of his Country-men, which kind of Death they having never seen before, it struck them with Terror, &amp; the <HI>French,</HI> think that this Severity was a great means of preserving the Peace till the year 1683.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> having settled <HI>New-York</HI> in 1609. (which they call'd the <HI>New-Netherlands</HI>) they enter'd into an Alliance with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> which continued without any Breach on either side, and were frequently useful to the
<PB N="26" REF="002849_0045_0FE676ADF1CB40E0"/>
<HI>French,</HI> in saving the <HI>French</HI> that were Prisoners from the Cruelty of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as before ob∣served.</P>
<P>In 1664. <HI>New-York</HI> was taken by the <HI>English,</HI> who immediately entred into an Alliance and Friendship with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> which has continued without the least Breach to this Day. History, I am afraid, cannot inform us of an Instance of the <HI>Most Christian</HI> or <HI>Most Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holick King</HI> Observing a League so strictly, and for so long a time as these <HI>Barbarians</HI> have done.</P>
<P>Both the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> (Peace being every where settled) endeavour to extend their Commerce and Alliances among the <HI>Indians</HI> which lie to the Westward of <HI>New-York.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> in their Measures discover'd a Design of Conquering and Commanding; for Mr. <HI>de Front<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c,</HI> who had succeeded in the Go∣vernment of <HI>Canada</HI> in the Year 1672, per∣swaded the <HI>Indians</HI> to allow him to build a Fort at <HI>Cadarackui,</HI> under the Notion of a Store for Merchandize and security for his Traders, and under the same pretence built small Forts at some other considerable Passes far in the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Prosecuted their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only with the Arts of Peace, by sending People among the <HI>Indians</HI> to gain their Affections, and to per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wade them to come to <HI>Albany</HI> to Trade; but ev'n these honest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="27" REF="002849_0046_0FE676AF1CA563A8"/>
Designs met with Obstruction, and had not so considerable Success, by reason of the War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as otherwise they might have had; for in the Year 1674. <HI>New-York</HI> being Surpriz'd by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and Restor'd, the alterations in Government and of Masters, obstructed very much the designs of gain∣ing the <HI>Indians.</HI> Their Trade was likewise considerably hindred by the War, which the <HI>Five Nations</HI> had with the <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Indians</HI> living on the Banks of <HI>Hudsons River,</HI> within or near the <HI>English</HI> Settlements.</NOTE> <HI>River In∣dians,</HI> which forced many of the <HI>River In∣dians</HI> to seek shelter among the <HI>Utawawas,</HI> who fell under the <HI>French</HI> Government.</P>
<P>At last the <HI>English, Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> ha∣ving made Peace in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Gover∣nor of <HI>New-York</HI> likewise having obtain'd a Peace between the <HI>Five Nations</HI> and <HI>Mahikan∣ders</HI> or <HI>River Indians,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> were at full liberty to prosecute their de∣signs of extending their Commerce among the <HI>Indians,</HI> which both did with very con∣siderable success and advantage to the In∣habitants of their Colonies.</P>
<P>But this Justice must be done to the <HI>French,</HI> that they far exceeded the <HI>English</HI> in the da∣ring attempts of some of their Inhabitants, in travelling very far among unknown <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002849_0047_0FE676AF467DC9F8"/>
discovering new Countries, and every where spreading the Fame of the <HI>French</HI> Name and Grandeur, by making themselves the Arbitrators in all difference between the <HI>Indian Nations.</HI> The Sieur <HI>Perot</HI> deserves to be remember'd, who pushed his Discoveries as far as the <HI>Putewatemies</HI> and Indians living round the farther Lakes, with the greatest Fatigues and Danger. He acquired the Lan∣guages of many Nations, and brought them to <HI>Canada</HI> to Trade, before the Peace was made with the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> In the Year 1667 he accomparied the Officer that was sent to the Fall of <HI>St. Mary,</HI> to take Possession of all that Country, in the name of the <HI>French King,</HI> in the presence of many of the Sachems of the Nations that liv'd round the Lakes, where there was an Alliance agree'd to with the <HI>French,</HI> but (ev'n by the <HI>French</HI> Books) no Subjection was Promised.</P>
<P>In the Year 1697. Mr. <HI>De la Sale</HI> built a Sloop or Bark of sixty Tons on <HI>Ohswego Lake,</HI> and provided her with great Guns. He car∣ried this Vessel as far as <HI>Missilimackinack,</HI> and there loaded her with Furrs and Skins, and then went on the Discovery of the <HI>Misissipi.</HI> He only left five or six <HI>French</HI> on board to carry her back to <HI>Oniagara:</HI> But the <HI>Indians</HI> entertain'd such a Jealousy of this floating Castle, that they resolv'd secretly to destroy

it, tho' they exprest nothing to Mr. <HI>De la Sale,</HI> but Admiration of the extraordinary Machine, and sent for all the Nations round to come to see it. When they were to∣gether they consulted how to surprize and destroy it; and this design they kept so se∣cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, not only before the Execution, that Mr. <HI>De la Sale</HI> had no suspicion of it, but afterwards likewise, for it was long be∣fore it was known what became of this Vessel. At first they thought of killing all the <HI>French</HI> among them, and throwing them∣selves on the <HI>English</HI> for their Protection; but their Courage fan'd them. They thought they might act with more security after Mr. <HI>De la Sale</HI> and his Company should be gone on their intended Discoveries. The <HI>French</HI> having no suspicion of their designs, permit∣ted a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> to come on board in a Bay where the Bark came to an Anchor, in her return, and the <HI>Indians</HI> taking advan∣tage of their Numbers, and the security of the <HI>French,</HI> murder'd the Men and burnt the Vessel.</P>
<P>The Courage and Resolution of these Gentlemen ought to be taken Notice of, for their Honour, not withstanding that the <HI>English</HI> say, that the Barrenness and Poverty of <HI>Canada</HI> pushes the Men of Spirit there

<P>For this reason about the year 1677. the Government of <HI>Maryland</HI> sent Coll. <HI>Coursey</HI> to <HI>Albany</HI> to make a League of Friendship be∣tween <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> on the one part, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the <HI>Five Nations</HI> on the other; but this League was soon shaken by some Parties of the <HI>Oneydoes, Onond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> who were out when this Covenant was made, and were ignorant of it.

<P>The <HI>Mohawks</HI> all this while kept themselve strictly to their League, and suffered none to their Indians to go towards <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P>There is reason to think that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who lived at <HI>Schenectady</HI> at that time, spirited up the <HI>Indians</HI> against the <HI>English;</HI> For the Commande at <HI>Albany</HI> hearing that the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> (the <HI>On<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ydoes</HI> especially) were in an Alarm from some Jealousy that they had entertain'd of the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>New-York</HI> sent <HI>Arnout</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> two Interpreters of the Indian Language, to per∣swade them to come to <HI>Albany,</HI> in order to be assured of the <HI>English</HI> Friendship, and to have their Jealousy remov'd. Which the Interpreter having happily brought to pass, <HI>Swerisse,</HI> one of the chief Men or Sachims of the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> ex∣cus'd his Country-men at <HI>Albany,</HI> the 15th of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> 1678, 9. as follows,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Father Corl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r;</HI></P>
<P>WE are now come to speak to you of some strange Occur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nces that have lately happened.</P>
<P>Last Harvest one of our Indians, call'd <HI>Treuhtanendo,</HI> went to <HI>Schenectady</HI> to buy goods; he was told of the Mischief we had
<PB N="33" REF="002849_0052_0FE676BDA6179258"/>
done in <HI>Virginia;</HI> To which the People of <HI>Schenectady</HI> added, That the <HI>English</HI> of this Government were very Angry, and that they would kill us.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards another of our Indians, call'd, <HI>Adagounwa,</HI> went to <HI>Schenectady,</HI> in his way to <HI>Albany;</HI> He was told by the People there, That if he went forward to <HI>Albany</HI> he might sing to Morrow, for the <HI>English</HI> there would bind and kill him; Whereupon he and another <HI>Indian</HI> immedi∣ately returned, and brought this Report to to our Castle at <HI>Oneido.</HI></P>
<P>But we now see the Governors good heart, notwithstanding of all this bad News.</P>
<P>At last the People of <HI>Schenectady</HI> told five of our Indians, who intended for <HI>Albany,</HI> That if they went forward they would all be Dead Men; upon which one run im∣mediately back, but the other four went forward. This Man, (who is called <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣wahrarihta</HI>) told us, That the other four Men were taken by the <HI>English,</HI> and that two or three hundred Men were upon their way to fight us. Upon hearing of this, I ac∣knowl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge, that though I, <HI>Swerisse,</HI> be a Sachem, I left the Affair wholly to our Soldiers, seeing that they were Soldiers who came against us; Whereupon our Men immediately Resolv'd to Fortifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Castle.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002849_0053_0FE676BDCC75D990"/>
While this was doing the War-Shout was raised. Our Men call'd out, <HI>That Horse-men came against us; Now we shall be put to it.</HI> These prov'd to be the two Interpreters, who being receiv'd into the Castle, our young Soldiers, whose Spirits had been ve∣hemently raised, run round them with their Hatchets in their hands, threatning to kill them. But I, <HI>Swerisse,</HI> did what I could to pacifie our Men, and told the Messengers, <HI>That we would hear them to Morrow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Father Corlaer;</HI> We desire that your Anger may be appeased, and that your Mind may be quieted. We give no credit to the stories which our <HI>Indians</HI> brought us from <HI>Schenectady,</HI> and we shall not believe any such Stories for the future Seeing all of us to the Westward, ev'n from <HI>New-York</HI> to the <HI>Sennekas,</HI> are under one Government, Why is <HI>Schenectady</HI> the only bad place? for We hold firmly to the Old Covenant.</P></Q>
<P>Then he gave a Belt of Wampum <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wampum</HI> is the current Money among the <HI>Indians,</HI> it is made of the large Whelk Shell (<HI>Briecinum</HI>) and shaped like long Beads.

The Wampum is of two sorts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black;</HI> the <HI>Black</HI> is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and most valuable.

<P><PB N="35" REF="002849_0054_0FE676BFEC52EC80"/>
He in the next place gave an account of what had happened in <HI>Virginia,</HI> And then said,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Father Corlaer;</HI></P>
<P>Have Pity on our Indian Prisoners, as We have had on these Prisoners (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR><HI>A Woman and her two Children</HI>) which we now deliver to you, notwithstanding that they have been giv'n away, according to our Custom. We pray therefore his Ho∣nour to take Pity on our People that are Prisoners, especially on the <HI>Indian</HI> Woman, his Kins-Woman, whom he hath adopted as a Grand-Child. Let them be Released, if alive, otherwise give us some of the <HI>Cana∣stoga Indians</HI> in their room. As to the other three Christian Prisoners, the Woman and her two Children that are yet with us, We desire first to have our Indians Restored, or others in their room, before they be De∣livered.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002849_0055_0FE676C014701DE0"/>
Governor <HI>Andross,</HI> being acquainted by Letter with this last Proposal of the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> required the immediate Delivery of the Chri∣stian Prisoners, and promised to write to <HI>Virginia</HI> to have the <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners saved Some Presents being given to to the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> they answered,</P>
<Q><P>We Thank the Governor for his good Inclination and Affection. Our Heart is good, and we see his Heart is likewise good; if it was otherwise we could not live: We thank the Governor for the Present now giv'n us: It is his wellcome from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Father Corlaer,</HI> We are your Children, and the <HI>Mobawks,</HI> your Brethren, are like∣wise our Fathers. We rejoyce because your Heartsare good. Since the Governor is not satisfied with these three Prisoners, we have now unanimously Resolved to bring the other three which are still with us, as soon as possible; but the Rivers are now so full of Water, that we cannot bring them this Moon, but the next Moon, I, <HI>Swerisse,</HI> pro∣mise to come with them.</P>
<P>We obey the Governor's Orders, that we may not be ashamed, and therefore We Release all the Prisoners. We hope the Governor will likewise act so as he need not be ashamed.</P>
<P>We do not now say, that we will see our
<PB N="37" REF="002849_0056_0FE676C6B14F8CE8"/>
Prisoners before we deliver the other Chri∣stians, but refer this Affair wholly to the Governor's Wisdom, which, we hope, will tend to our good and continued Wellfair. And say again, That we will bring the three Christian Prisoners by the first opportunity of fair Weather.</P>
<P>We likewise make known to our Father <HI>Corlaer,</HI> That in our Fury and Anger (after the People of the South had fallen upon us) We took these six Prisoners, and afterwards four Scalps were brought by our People, and no more.</P>
<P>We speak as <HI>Oneydoes,</HI> for our selves. If the <HI>Susquehana</HI> or <HI>Delaware</HI> Indians have done any Mischief, let not that be impu∣ted to us.</P>
<P>Eight of our People are now out against the <HI>Christians,</HI> of which we told <HI>Aernout</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> when they were at our Castle. They know nothing of what we have now agree'd to, and therefore if they should happen to do any harm, let it be passed by, for they are entirely Ignorant of the Governor's Orders. If they shall do any thing, we shall not keep it secret. If any of the <HI>Christian</HI> Prisoners shall dye before we bring them, we should be sorry; yet they are Mortal.</P></Q>
<P>Accordingly in <HI>May</HI> following the <HI>Oneydoes</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="002849_0057_0FE676C6D7E6CA28"/>
brought the other three Prisoners to <HI>Albany.</HI> And on the 24th of that Month <HI>Swerisse</HI> made the following Speech, when he deliver'd them to the Commander at <HI>Albany,</HI> and the Commissioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Bretheren;</HI></P>
<P>WE are come to this place with much Trouble, as we did last Winter, and renew the Request we then made, that six <HI>Indians</HI> be delivered to us in the room of the six <HI>Christians,</HI> in case those of our People who are Prisoners in <HI>Virginia</HI> be dead. None of our <HI>Indians</HI> have gone out against the <HI>English</HI> since we were last here; but we have told you that some of ours were then out, who were ignorant of the Governor's Orders, and we desired that if they happen'd to do any harm, it might not be ill taken. Now thirteen of our People who went against our <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies, met with eighteen <HI>English</HI> on Horseback, as far from any of the <HI>English</HI> Plantations as <HI>Cahnuaga</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The first <HI>Mohawk</HI> Castle.</NOTE> is from <HI>Albany.</HI> They fir'd upon our Peo∣ple; ours being Soldiers, return'd their Fire and kill'd two Men and two Horses, and brought away their Scalps.</P>
<P>It would be convenient that the Gover∣nor
<PB N="39" REF="002849_0058_0FE676C8599652D0"/>
nor acquaint the People of <HI>Virginia,</HI> not to send their Men so far abroad, for if they should happen to meet our Parties in their way against our Enemies, the <HI>Cahnowas,</HI> whom the <HI>English</HI> call <HI>Arogisti,</HI> dangerous Consequences might follow.</P>
<P>We have now submitted to the Gover∣nor's Order, in bringing the three other Christian Prisoners. When we were here last Winter, we left the Affair of our Pri∣son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs wholy to the Governor, and pro∣mised to bring the three Christian Priso∣ners that remain'd with us. This we have now perform'd: But where are our Priso∣ners, or if they be dead, the others in their room, tho' it be already so late in the Spring: However, we still refer this to the Governor.</P></Q>
<P>(Then taking the <HI>Christian</HI> Girl, who was a Prisoner, by the hand, said) <Q>This Girl was deliver'd to an <HI>Indian Squa</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">A Woman.</NOTE> here present, who's Brother then was kill'd. If we had been full of Wrath, and not afraid of further Inconveni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, we would have burnt her.</Q></P>
<P>(Taking the Boy, another of the three, by the hand, said) <Q>This Boy was giv'n to an <HI>Indian</HI> here present, but he is now free.
<PB N="40" REF="002849_0059_0FE676C881FCCDE8"/>
We have now perform'd our Promises, and are not ashamed. We hope <HI>Corlaer,</HI> who Governs the whole Country, will likewise do that of which he needeth not be ashamed.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Corlaer</HI> governs the whole Land, from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Albany,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Sennekas</HI> Land; We who are his Sub∣jects shall faithfully keep the Covenant Chain: Let him perform his Promise, as we have perform'd ours, that the Covenant Chain be not broken on his side, who go∣verns the whole Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Corlaers</HI> Limits, as we have said, stretch so far ev'n to <HI>Jacob my Friend,</HI> or <HI>Jacob Young,</HI> and we have heard that <HI>Corlaer</HI> is in good Correspondence with <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland;</HI> Why is it then that our Peo∣ple, who are Prisoners, are not restored? Let what we now say be well observed, for we have observed the Governor's Or∣ders.</Q></P>
<P>Lastly (taking the Woman Prisoner by the hand, said) <Q>This Woman was given to that <HI>Indian,</HI> (<HI>pointing,</HI>) but is now free, being the sixth. If those of our People who are Prisoners be Dead, let us have six <HI>Indians</HI> in their room. It is not by my Au∣thority that these Prisoners have been re∣leased, but by the good Will of them to
<PB N="41" REF="002849_0060_0FE676CE536C1778"/>
whom they were given.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our Soldiers are to go out against the <HI>Dewagunhas,</HI> let us have Ammunition cheap.</Q></P>
<P>Then the Commissioners gave them Presents for their kind Usage of the Prisoners.</P>
<P>After which <HI>Swerisse</HI> stood up and said, <Q>Let <HI>Corl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> take care that the <HI>Indian Squa</HI> that is wanting come again, and for those that are killed, others in their room. If <HI>Corl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> will not hearken to us in this Affair, we shall not hereafter hearken to him in any.</Q></P>
<P>They hearing afterwards that these last words were ill taken, <HI>Swerisse, Jehonongera</HI> and <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nohguage,</HI> three of the chief <HI>Oneydo</HI> Sachems excused it, saying, <Q>What we said of not hearkening any more to <HI>Corl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> was not from the heart, but only by way of Dis∣course, to make <HI>Corl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r</HI> more careful to release our People that are Prisoners; for it was said after your Answer, and without la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing down either Bev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r or any Belt or Wampum, as we always do when we make <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>Proposition</HI> has been always used by the Commissioner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs at <HI>Albany,</HI> to signifie <HI>Pro∣posals</HI> or <HI>Articles,</HI> in the Treaties or Agreements made with the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> Propositions; Therefore we desire that
<PB N="42" REF="002849_0061_0FE676CE88A35590"/>
if it be noted, it may be blotted out, and not made known to <HI>Corlaer;</HI> for we hold firmly to our Covenant, as we said in our Propositions.</Q></P>
<P>They at the same time told, That the <HI>Sin∣nondowans</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">A Castle of the <HI>Sennekas,</HI> from whence the <HI>French</HI> call all the <HI>Sennekas, Tsonontouan.</HI></NOTE> came to them with eight Belts, desiring that they should no longer prosecute the War with <HI>Virginia,</HI> or <HI>Virginia Indians,</HI> but to go with them to War against the <HI>Dowa∣ganhas,</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Comprehended under the General name of <HI>Uta∣wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us.</HI></NOTE> a Nation lying to the North-west ward; and that the <HI>Sennekas</HI> did desire them to set these <HI>Christians</HI> at Liberty, and to car∣ry them to <HI>Albany.</HI> All which they said they promised to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> continuing still to be troublesome to <HI>Virginia,</HI> that Government, in <HI>September</HI> following, sent Col. <HI>William Kendall</HI> and Col. <HI>Southley Littleton</HI> to <HI>Albany,</HI> to Re∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w and Confirm the League between <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI> and the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> Col. <HI>Littleton</HI> dy'd at <HI>Albany</HI> before the <HI>Indians</HI> arriv'd.

<P><Q>We are glad that by the Interposition and Perswasion of our Governor, the Mischeif which our Neighbours did in your Country is passed over, and now wholly forgiven.

<P><Q>We were told before we heard your Propositions, that one of the Agents from <HI>Virginia</HI> was Dead.

The <HI>Onnondagas</HI> did not come till <HI>November,</HI> on the 5th of which Month the <HI>Virginia</HI> Agent spoke to them in the same words he had done to the <HI>Oneydoes.</HI> None of their Answers appear upon the Registers, except the <HI>Mo∣hawks,</HI> which we have given. It is certain that the <HI>Onnondagas</HI> and <HI>Oneydoes</HI> did not observe the Peace with <HI>Virginia,</HI> but molested them with the reiterated Incursions of their Parties. It is observable however, that these two Nations and the <HI>Cayugas</HI> only, had received <HI>French Priests</HI> among them, and that none of the rest who were not under the Influence of those Priests, ever molested the <HI>English;</HI> for which reason Coll. <HI>Dongan,</HI> tho' a <HI>Papist,</HI> complained of the ill Offices the Priests did to the <HI>English</HI> Interest, and forbid the <HI>Five Nations</HI> to enter∣tain any of them, tho' the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Crowns, while he was Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> in King <HI>James'</HI>s R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gn, seem'd to be more than ever in strict Friendship.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> could have no hopes of per∣swading the <HI>Indians</HI> to hurt any of the In∣habitants of <HI>New-York,</HI> but they were in hopes, that by the <HI>Indian</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doing frequently Mischief in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> would be forced to joyn in resenting the Injury, and thereby that Union between the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> would be broke, which always ob∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ructed

<P>These new Incursions of these two Nati∣ons were so troublesome to the People of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that their Governor, the Lord <HI>Ho∣ward</HI> of <HI>Effingham,</HI> thought it necessary for their Security, to undertake a Voyage to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Propositions made by the Right Honourable Francis Lord Howard of Effingham, Governor Gene∣ral of His Majesty's Dominion of Virginia, To the Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnonda∣gas and Cayugas.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now about seven years ago since you (unprovok'd) came into <HI>Virginia,</HI> a Country belonging to the Great King of <HI>England,</HI> and committed several Murders and Robberys, carrying away our <HI>Christian</HI> Women and Children Prisoners into your Castles. All which Injurys we designed to have Revenged on you; but at the de∣sire of Sir <HI>Edmond Andross,</HI> then Governor General of this Country, we desisted from destroying you, and sent our Agents Col. <HI>William Kendall</HI> and Col. <HI>Southley Littleton,</HI> to Confirm and make sure the Peace that Col. <HI>Coursey</HI> of <HI>Maryland</HI> included us in, when first he Treated with you. We find, that as you quickly forgot what you promised Col. <HI>Coursey,</HI> so you have willfully broke the Covenant Chain, which you promised our Agent, Col. <HI>Kendall,</HI> should be most strong and bright, if we of <HI>Virginia,</HI> would bury in the Pit of Oblivion, the Injurys you had then done us, which upon your Governor <HI>Andross'</HI>s Intercession, and your
<PB N="51" REF="002849_0070_0FE676E375E5C678"/>
Submission, we were willing to forget; But you not at all minding the Covenant then made, have every year since, come into our Country, in a War-like manner, under pretence of Fighting with our <HI>Indians,</HI> our Friends and Neighbours, which you ought not to have done, our Agent having enclu∣ded them likewise in the Peace. You not only destroyed and took many of them Prisoners, but you have also kill'd and burnt our <HI>Christian People,</HI> destroying our Corn and Tobacco, more than you made use of, killing our Horses, Hogs and Cattle, not to eat, but let them ly in the Woods and stink. This you did, when you were not denyed any thing you said you want∣ed.</P>
<P>I must also tell you, that under the pre∣tence of Friendship, you have come to our Houses at the heads of our Rivers (where they have been fortified) with a white Sheet on a Pole, and have laid down your Guns before the Fort, upon which our People taking you to be Friends, have admitted your great Men into their Forts, and have given them Meat and Drink, what they desired. After the great Men had refreshed themselves, and desiring to return, as they were let out of the Fort Gates, the young Men rushed into the Fort and plunder'd the
<PB N="52" REF="002849_0071_0FE676E39E961400"/>
House, taking away and destroying all the Corn, Tobacco, Bedding, and what else was in the House. When they went away, they took several Sheep with them, and kill'd several Cows big with Calf, and left them behind them, cut to pieces and flung about, as if it were in Defiance of the Peace, and destroying of our Friendship.</P>
<P>These, and many more Injurys that you have done us, have caused me to raise Forces, to send to the heads of our Rivers to defend our People from your Outrages, till I came to <HI>New-York</HI> to Col. <HI>Thomas Dongan,</HI> your Governor General, to desire him, as we are all one Kings Subjects, to assist me in Warring against you, to Revenge the <HI>Christian</HI> Blood that you have shed, and to make you give full Satisfaction for all the goods that you destroyed. But by the Mediation of your Governor, I am now come to <HI>Albany</HI> to speak with you; and to know the reason of your breaking the Cove∣nant Chain, not only with us and our neigh∣bour <HI>Indians</HI> but with <HI>Maryland,</HI> who are great King <HI>Charles'</HI>s Subjects; for our <HI>Indians</HI> have giv'n great King <HI>Charles</HI> their Land. Therefore I, the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> will protect them, as your Governor under the Great <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Albany;</HI> will hence∣forth you, when the Chain of Friendship is made between us all.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002849_0072_0FE676EA17A348E8"/>
Now that I have let you know that I am sensible of all the Injurys that you have done us, by the desire of your noble Go∣vernor General, I am willing to make a new Chain with you for <HI>Virginia, Maryland,</HI> and our <HI>Indians,</HI> that may be more strong and lasting, even to the World's end, so that we may all be Bretheren and Great King <HI>Charles'</HI>s Children.</P>
<P>I propose to you, <HI>First,</HI> That you call out of our Countrys of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mary∣land</HI> all your young Men or Soldiers that are now there.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That you do not hinder or molest our, Friend <HI>Indians</HI> from Hunting at our Mountains, it having been their Country and none of yours. They never go into your Country to disturb any of you.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Tho' the Damages you have done our Country be very great, and would require a great deal of Satisfaction, which you are bound to give, yet we as∣sure you, that only by the Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wasions of your Governor, who is at a vast deal of Trouble and Charge for your Wellfare, which you ever ought to acknowledge, I have passed it by and forgiven you, upon this Condition, that your People, nor any living among you, never commit any Incursions on our <HI>Christians</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI>

living among us, or in <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P>For the better Confirmation of the same and that the Peace now concluded, may be lasting, I propose to have two <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">All Indians make use of the Hatchet or Ax as an Emblem to express War.</NOTE> Hatchets buried as a final Determination of all Wars and Jarrings between us: One on behalf of us and our <HI>Indians,</HI> and the other for all your Nations united to∣gether, that ever did us any Injury, or pretended to War against our <HI>Indian</HI> Friends or <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P>And that nothing may be wanting for Confirmation thereof, (if you desire it) we are willing to send some of our <HI>Indian</HI> Sachems with an Agent next Summer, about this time, that they may Ratifie the Covenant with you here in this prefixed House, where you may see and speak to∣gether as Friends.</P>
<P>That the Covenant now made between us in this prefixed House, in the presence of your Governor, may be firmly kept and perform'd on your parts, as it always has on ours, and that you do not break any one Link of the Covenant Chain for the future, by your Peoples coming near our Plantations; When you march to the

Southward, keep to the feet of the Moun∣tains, and not come nigh the heads, of our Rivers, there being no Bever Hunting there; for we shall not for the future (tho' you lay down your Arms as Friends) ever trust you more, you have so often deceiv'd us.</P>

<P>The next Day the <HI> Mohawks </HI> answered first by their Speaker, saying,</P>
<P><Q>WE must, in the first place, say something to the other three Na∣tions by way of Reproof for their not keep∣ing the former Covenant, as they ought, and therefore we desire you, great Sachem of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and you <HI>Corlaer,</HI> and all Peo∣ple here present, to hearken, for we will conceal nothing of the Evil they have done.</Q></P>
<P>(Then turning to the other three Nations) <Q>You have heard Yesterday all that has been said; as for our parts, we are free of the blame laid on us for the Mischief done in <HI>Virgi∣nia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI> You are Stupid, Bru∣tish, and have no Understanding, thus to break your Covenant. We have always been obedient to <HI>Corlaer</HI> and have steadily kept our Covenant with <HI>Virginia, Mary∣land</HI> and <HI>Boston;</HI> we must therefore Stamp Understanding into you.

Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Odianne,</HI> the same <HI>Mohawk</HI> Speaker, turning to my Lord, spoke in behalf of all the four Nations.</P>
<P><Q>We are very thankful to you, great Sachem of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that you are pleased to be per∣swaded by <HI>Corlaer,</HI> our Governor, to forgive all former Faults. We are very glad to hear you and to see your Heart softned. Take these three Bevers as a Token.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We thank the great Sachem of <HI>Virginia</HI> for saying, that the Ax shall be thrown into the Pit. Take these two Bevers as a Token of our Joy and Thankfulness.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are glad that <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">The Name which the <HI>Five Nations</HI> always give the</NOTE> <HI>Assarigoa,</HI> will bury in the Pit what is past, and stamp thereon.

<P><Q>My Lord, you are a Man of great Know∣ledge and Understanding, thus to keep the Covenant Chain bright as Silver, and now again to Renew it, and make it stronger.</Q></P>
<P>(Then pointing to the othe three Nations said,) <Q>But they are Covenant Breakers. I lay down this as a Token that we <HI>Mohawks</HI> have kept the Covenant entire on out parts:</Q> Giving two Bevers and a Raccoon.</P>

<P><Q>We now plant a <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Five Nations</HI> always express <HI>Peace</HI> under the Metapher of a <HI>Tree,</HI> in this manner.</NOTE> Tree, who's tops will reach the Sun, and its Branches spread far abroad, so that it shall be seen afar off; &amp; we shall shelter ourselves under it, and live in Peace, without molestation. </Q><HI>Gives two Bevers.</HI></P>
<P><Q>You proposed yesterday, that if we were desirous to see the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> you are willing to send some of their Sachems next Summer about this time to this Place. This Proposal pleases us very much. The sooner they come, it will be the better, that we may speak with them in this House, which is apointed for our speaking with our Friends.</Q> And gave two Belts to confirm it.</P>
<P><Q>You have now heard what Exhortation we have made to the other three Nations. We have taken the Hatchet out of their hands. We now therefore pray, that your Hatchet may likewise be buried in the Pit.</Q> Giving two Bevers,</P>
<P><Q>Let the River be secure, for we some∣times make Propositions to the <HI>Raritan</HI> and <HI>Nevessink Indians;</HI> but above all, let your <HI>Virginia Indians</HI> come securely hither, that

we may keep a good Correspondence with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>My Lord,</HI> Some of us <HI>Mohawks</HI> are out against Our Enemies that live a far off. When they come near your Plantations, they will do you no harm, nor Plunder as the others do. Be kind to them, if they shall happen to come to any of your Plan∣tations. Give them some Tobacco and some Victuals; for they will neither Rob nor Steal, as the <HI>Oneydoes, Onnondagas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas</HI> have done.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Oneydoes</HI> particularly Thank your Lordship for hearkening to lay down the Ax.</Q> The Hatchet is taken out of all their hands. And gives a Belt.</P>
<P><Q>We again thank your Lordship, that the Covenant Chain is Renewed. Let it be kept clean and bright, and held fast, Let not any one pull his Arm from it. We enclude all the <HI>Four Nations</HI> in giving this Belt.</Q></P>

<P>The <HI>Oneydoes</HI> give twenty Bevers, as satis∣faction for what they promised my Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> and desire that they may be Dis∣charged.</P>

<P>Then the three Nations spoke by an <HI>Onnon∣daga,</HI> call'd <HI>Thanohjanihta,</HI> who said,</P>
<P><Q>We Thank the great Sachem of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that he has so readily forgiven and forgot the Evil that has been done; And We, on our parts, gladly catch at and lay hold of the Chain.</Q> Then each of them deliver an Ax to be buried, and gave a Belt.</P>

<P>The <HI>Mohawks</HI> by themselves, and the other three Nations by themselves, spoke to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> much to the same purpose that they did to the Governor of <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> so far as it r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lated to the Affair of <HI>Virginia,</HI> but with some particular Marks of Personal Esteem; for he had won their Affections by his former carriage towards them.

<P>Coll. <HI>Dongan</HI> desired them to call home those

<P>Before I proceed further it will be necessary to incert a Remarkable Speech made by the <HI>Onnondagas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> to the two Governors, on the 2d day of <HI>August,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>

We desire <HI>Colaer,</HI> our Governor, may send over this Proposition to the great Sachem, <HI>Charles,</HI> who dwells on the other side the great Lake, with this Belt of Wam∣pum, and this other smaller Belt to the <HI>Duke of York,</HI> his Brother; And we give you, <HI>Corlaer,</HI> this Beaver, to send over this Pro∣position.</P>
<P>You great Man of <HI>Virginia,</HI> We let you know, that great <HI>Penn</HI> did speak to us here in <HI>Corlaers</HI> House, by his Agents; and de∣sired to buy the <HI>Susquehana River</HI> of us, but we would not hearken to him; for we had fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten'd it to this Government.

that lives on the other side the great Lake, know this, that We being a Free People, tho' united to the <HI>English,</HI> may give our Lands, and be joyn'd to the Sachem we like best. We give this Bever to Remember what we say.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Senekas</HI> arrived soon after, and on the 5th of <HI>August</HI> spoke to my Lord <HI>Howard</HI> in the following manner.</P>
<Q><P>WE have heard and understood what Mischief hath been done in <HI>Vir∣ginia.</HI> We have it as perfect as if it were upon our Fingers ends. O <HI>Corlaer!</HI> We Thank you for having been our Intercessor, so that the Ax hath not fallen upon Us.</P>
<P>And you, <HI>Assar goa,</HI> great Sachem of <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> We Thank you for burying all Evil in the Pit. We are inform'd, that the <HI>Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gas</HI> and <HI>Cayugaes</HI> have buried the Ax already; Now we that live the remotest off, are come to do the same, and to include in this Chain the <HI>Cah∣nawaas,</HI> your Friends, who live amongst you. We desire therefore, that an Ax, on our part, may be buried with one of my Lords. O <HI>Corlaer! Corl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er!</HI> We Thank you for holding one end of the Ax: And We thank you, great Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> not only
<PB N="67" REF="002849_0086_0FE67703C9827E78"/>
for throwing aside the Ax, but more espe∣cially for your puting all Evil from your Heart. Now we have a New Chain, a strong and a str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight Chain that cannot be broken. The <HI>Tree of Peace</HI> is planted so firmly that it cannot be moved. Let us on both sides hold the Chain fast.</P>
<P>We understand what you said of the great Sachem that lives on the other side the great Water.</P>
<P>You tell us, that the <HI>Cahnawaas</HI> will come hither to strengthen the Chain. Let them not make any Excuse, that they are Old and Feeble, or that their Feet are Sore. If the Old Sachems cannot, let the Young Man come. We shall not fail to come hither, tho' we live the farthest off, and then the New Chain will be stronger and brighter.</P>
<P>We understand, that because of the Mis∣chief which has been done to the People and Cattle of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> we must not come near the Heads of your Rivers, nor near your Plantations, but keep at the foot of the Mountains; for tho' we lay down our Arms, as Friends, we shall not be trusted for the future, but look'd on as Robbers. We agree, however, to this Proposition, and shall wholly stay away from <HI>Virginia:</HI> And this we do in gratitude
<PB N="68" REF="002849_0087_0FE67703F4604F58"/>
to <HI>Corlaer,</HI> who has been at so great Pains to perswade you, <HI>Great Governor of Virginia,</HI> to forget what is past. We commend your Understanding, in giving ear to <HI>Corlaer's</HI> good Advice; and we shall go a Path which was never trod before.</P>
<P>We have now done speaking to <HI>Corlaer,</HI> and the Governor of <HI>Virginia.</HI> Let the Chain be forever kept clean and bright, and we shall do the same.</P>
<P>The other Nations, from the <HI>Mohawks</HI> Country to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> have deliver'd up the <HI>Susquehana River,</HI> and all that Country, to <HI>Corlaer'</HI>s Government. We Confirm what they have done, by giving this Belt. Ten Bevers are at the <HI>Onnondagas</HI> Castle in their way hither; We design five of them for <HI>Corlaer,</HI> and the other five for the Sachem of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Coll. <HI>Bird,</HI> one of the Council of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Edmond Jennings,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; Attorney General of that Province, came with four <HI>Indian</HI> Sachems, (according to my Lord <HI>Howard'</HI>s Promise) to Renew and Confirm the Peace, and met the <HI>Five Nations</HI> at <HI>Albany</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> 1685.</P>
<P>Coll. <HI>Bird</HI> accus'd them of having again broke their Covenant, by taking an <HI>Indian</HI> Girl
<PB N="69" REF="002849_0088_0FE6770B0C829F18"/>
from an <HI>English</HI> Mans House, and four <HI>Indian</HI> Boys Prisoners.</P>
<P>They excused this, by its being done by the Parties that were out when the Peace was con∣cluded, who knew nothing of it; Which Accidents they had provided against in their Articles. They said, The four Boys were given to the Relations of those Men that were lost, and it would be very difficult to obtain their Restoration. But they promised to de∣liver them up.</P>
<P>The <HI>Senek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Mohawks</HI> declared them∣selves free of any blame, and child the other Nations.</P>
<P>So that we may still observe the Influence which the <HI>French Priests</HI> had obtain'd over those other Nations, and to what Christian-like Purposes they us'd it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mohawks</HI> Speaker said, <HI>Where shall I seek the Chain of Peace? Where shall I find it, but upon Our Path? And whither doth Our Path lead us, but unto this House? This is a House of Peace.</HI> And sang all the Covenant Chain over. He afterwards sang by way of Admonition to the <HI>Onnondagas, Cayugas</HI> and <HI>Oneydoes,</HI> and con∣cluded all with a Song to the <HI>Virginia Indians.</HI> But I suppose our Interpreters were not Poets enough to Translate the Songs, otherwise I might have gratified the Reader with a taste of <HI>Indian Poetry.</HI></P>

<P>Y<HI>Onnondio,</HI> I Honour you, and the Warriors that are with me all likewise honour you. Your Interpreter has finished your Speech; I now begin mine. My words make haste to reach your Eears, hearken to them.</P>
<P><HI>Yonnondio,</HI> You must have believed when you left <HI>Quebeck,</HI> that the Sun had burnt up all the Forests which render our Country Unaccessible to the <HI>French,</HI> Or that the Lakes had so far overflown their Banks, that they had surrounded our Castles, and that it was impossible for us to get out of them. Yes, <HI>Yonnondio,</HI> surely you must have thought so, and the Curiosity of seeing so great a Country burnt up, or under Water. has brought you so far. Now you are undeceived, since that I and my Warriors
<PB N="86" REF="002849_0095_0FE6770CAC463698"/>
are come to assure you that the <HI>Sennekas, Cayugas, Onnondagas, Oneydoes</HI> and <HI>Mohawks</HI> are all alive. I thank you, in their Name, for bringing back into their Country the <HI>Calumet</HI> which your Predecessor received from their hands. It was happy for you that you left under ground that Murdering Hatchet which has been so often dyed in the Blood of the <HI>French.</HI> Hear <HI>Yonnondio.</HI> I do not Sleep, I have my eyes Open, and the Sun which enlightens me discovers to me a great Captain at the head of a Com∣pany of Soldiers, who speaks as if he were Dreaming. He says that he only came to the Lake to smoak on the great <HI>Calumer</HI> with the <HI>Onnondagas.</HI> But <HI>Garangula</HI> says that he sees the Contrary, that it was to knock them on the head, if Sickness had not weakned the Arms of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I see <HI>Yonnondio</HI> Raving in a Camp of sick men, who's Lives the great Spirit has saved, by Inflicting this Sickness on them Hear <HI>Yonnondio,</HI> Our Women had taker their Clubs, our Children and Old Men had carried their Bows and Arrows into the heart of your Camp, if our Warrior had not disarmed them, and retained then when your Messenger, <HI>Ohquesse</HI> appeared in our Castle. It is done, and I have said it.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="002849_0096_0FE67713B3BBAAE8"/>
Hear <HI>Yonnondio,</HI> we plundered none of the <HI>French,</HI> but those that carried Guns, Powder and Ball to the <HI>Twihties</HI> and <HI>Chic∣taghicks;</HI> because those Arms might have cost us our Lives. Herein we follow the example of the Jesuits, who stave all the Barrels of Rum brought to our Castle, lest the Drunken <HI>Indians</HI> should knock them on the Head. Our Warriors have not Bevers enough to pay for all these Arms that they have taken, and our Old Men are not afraid of the War. <HI>This Belt pre∣serves my words.</HI></P>
<P>We carried the <HI>English</HI> into our Lakes, to traffick there with the <HI>Utawawas</HI> and <HI>Qutoghies,</HI> as the <HI>Adirondacks</HI> brought the <HI>French</HI> to our Castles, to carry on a Trade which the <HI>English</HI> say is theirs.

here do not choak the Tree of Peace planted in so small a Fort.

The <HI>Five Nations</HI> have few or no Bevers in their own Country, and are for that reason obliged to hunt at a great distance, which often occasion'd Disputes with their Neighbours about the Property of the Bever, in some parts of the Country.
<PB N="92" REF="002849_0101_0FE6771BE614CB68"/>
The Bevers are the most valuable part of the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade. And as the <HI>Twihtwies</HI> carried their Bever to the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> favour'd the <HI>Five Nations</HI> in these Expeditions, and par∣ticularly in the beginning of the year 1687, made the <HI>Five Nations</HI> a Present of a Barrel of Powder, when their whole Force was pre∣paring to go against the <HI>Twihtwies.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> were the better pleas'd with this War, because they thought it would divert their Thoughts from the <HI>Indians</HI> that were Friends to <HI>Virginia:</HI> But the <HI>French</HI> were resolv'd to Support their Friends more effectually by a powerful Diver∣sion, and to change the Seat of the War.</P>
<P>For this purpose Mr. <HI>De N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nville</HI> sent, in <HI>May,</HI> 1687, great Quantities of Provisions to <HI>Cadarackui</HI> Fort, and gather'd the whole Force of <HI>Canada</HI> to <HI>Montreal.</HI> His Army consisted of 1500 <HI>French</HI> of the Regular Troops &amp; Militia, and 500 <HI>Indians</HI> that lived near <HI>Monreal</HI> and <HI>Quebeck.</HI></P>
<P>He sent likewise Orders to the Commandant at <HI>Missilimakinak</HI> to assemble all the Nations round him, and to March them to <HI>Oniag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in order to joyn the Forces of <HI>Canada</HI> design'd against the <HI>Sennekas.</HI> And the other Officers posted among the <HI>Indians</HI> West ward, had the like Orders.</P>

<P>The <HI>Putewatemies, Malhominies</HI> and <HI>Puans</HI> offer'd themselves willingly, and went to the Rendevouze at <HI>Missilimainak,</HI> where they were receiv'd by the <HI>Utawawas</HI> with all the Marks of Honour usually paid to Soldiers, tho' the <HI>Utawawas</HI> had no inclination to the present Enterprize; they could not tell, how∣ever, how to appear against it, otherwise than by inventing what Delays they could to pre∣vent their Marching.</P>
<P>In the mean while, a Cannoe arriv'd, which was sent by Mr. <HI>De Nonville</HI> with his Orders to the Officers. This Cannoe in her Passage discover'd some <HI>English</HI> commanded by Major <HI>Mr. Gregory,</HI> in their way to <HI>Teiodondaraghie.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> thought (after they had an account

of the new Alliance their King had enter'd into with the <HI>French</HI>) that the French would not disturb them in prosecuting a Trade with the Indians every where, and that the Trade would be equally free and open to both Na∣tions. With these hopes a considerable Num∣ber of Adventurers went out under the Con∣duct of Major <HI>M&apos; Gregory</HI> to Trade with the Indians living on the Banks of the Lakes; and that they might be the more wellcome, per∣swaded the <HI>Five Nations</HI> to set all the <HI>Dionon∣dadie</HI> Prisoners at Liberty, who went along with the <HI>English</HI> and conducted them towards <HI>Missilimakinak</HI> or <HI>Teiodondoraghie.</HI> But the <HI>English</HI> found themselves mistaken, for the <HI>French</HI> Commandant at <HI>Teiodondoraghie,</HI> as soon as he had Notice of this, sent 300 <HI>French</HI> to intercept the <HI>English.</HI></P>

The Return of the <HI>Dionondadie</HI> Prisoners made that Nation very hearty in favouring the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> they therefore marched immediately off, with design to joyn Major <HI>M&apos; Gregory,</HI> but
<PB N="95" REF="002849_0104_0FE677254B146918"/>
the <HI>Utawawas</HI> were divided in their Inclina∣tions, their Chief, with about thirty more joyn'd the <HI>French,</HI> the rest remain'd in suspence and stood Neuter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Utawawas</HI> thus wavering, disconcert∣ed the Measures of the <HI>Deionondadies,</HI> for they began to suspect the <HI>Utawawas,</HI> and therefore immediately return'd to secure their Wives and Children they had left near the <HI>French</HI> Fort with the <HI>Utawawas.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> and their Effects were seized without any Opposition, and were carried to the <HI>French</HI> Fort at <HI>Teio∣dondoraghie.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> brought great Quantities of Rum with them, (which the <HI>Indians</HI> love more than their Life) and the <HI>French</HI> being afraid that if the <HI>Indians</HI> took to drinking, they would grow ungovernable, did what they could to keep them from it. They were most concerned that the <HI>Putewatemies,</HI> (who had no knowledge of the <HI>English,</HI> or of that be∣witching Liquor, and were firmly attached to the <HI>French</HI>) should not taste it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Utawawas</HI> still contrived delays to the March, and having got some of the <HI>Putewate∣mies</HI> privately by themselves, they offered them a Cag of Rum, and said, <Q>We are all Bretheren, we ought to make one Body, and to have one Soul. The <HI>French</HI> invite us to War against the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> with design
<PB N="96" REF="002849_0105_0FE677256CEF20C8"/>
to make us Slaves, and that we should make our selves the Tools to effect it. As soon as they shall have destroyed the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> they will no longer observe any Measures with us, but use us like those Beasts that they tye to their Plows. Let us leave them to themselves, and they'll never be able to accomplish any thing against the <HI>Five Na∣tions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But the <HI>Putewatemies</HI> had entertain'd such Notions of the <HI>French,</HI> as made them Deaf to all the Politicks of the <HI>Utawawas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> however grew Jealous of these Caballings, and therefore resolv'd to delay their March no longer, and would not stay one day more for the <HI>Utawawas,</HI> who desired only so much time to Pitch their Canoes, but went away without them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tonti</HI> Commandant among the <HI>Chictag∣hicks</HI> met with another Party of the <HI>English</HI> of about 30 Men in <HI>Lake O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swego</HI> as he march∣ed with the <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aghicks</HI> and <HI>Twihtwiks,</HI> and other neighbouring Nations to the General Rendevouze. He fell upon the <HI>English,</HI> Plundered them, and took them Prisoners. The <HI>French</HI> divided all the Merchandize among the <HI>Indians,</HI> but kept the Rum to themselves and got all drunk. The <HI>Dconondadic</HI> Prisoners, that Conducted the <HI>English,</HI> joyned with the <HI>Mihikander Indians</HI> that were among Mr. <HI>Tonti's
<PB N="97" REF="002849_0106_0FE67726E4B97D40"/>
Indians</HI> (who had privately disswaded about 200 of the neighbouring Nations from going along with <HI>Tonti</HI>) and endeavoured to perswade all the <HI>Indians</HI> to fall upon the <HI>French,</HI> while they were drunk, and destroy them, saying, <HI>The</HI> French <HI>are a Proud, Imperious, Covetous People, that sell their goods at an extravagant Price: The</HI> English <HI>are a good Natured, Honest People, who will furnish you with every thing at reasonable Rates.</HI> But these arguments were to no pur∣pose, for these <HI>far Indians</HI> had entertained extraordinary Notions of the <HI>French Power,</HI> and knew nothing of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Putewatemies</HI> being gone from <HI>Teiodondoraghie,</HI> the <HI>Utawawas</HI> began to be afraid of the <HI>French</HI> Resentment, and there∣fore the better to keep up the colour they had put on their delays, marched over Land with all possible expedition, to the general Ren∣devouz near <HI>Oniagara,</HI> where all the <HI>French</HI> Force, both <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> was to meet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> being informed of the <HI>French</HI> Preparations, laid aside their Designs against the <HI>Twihtwies,</HI> and prepared to give the <HI>French</HI> a warm Reception. Upon this the Priest at <HI>Onnondaga</HI> left them, and their Soldiers came to <HI>Albany</HI> to provide Ammunition. The Commissioners made them a Present of a considerable quantity of Powder and Lead, besides what they purchased. They were
<PB N="98" REF="002849_0107_0FE677270F6D1CA8"/>
under a great deal of Concern when they took leave of the Commissioners, and said, <Q>Since we are to expect no other Assistance from our Brethren, we must recommend our Wives and Children to you, who will fly to you, if any Misfortune shall happen to us. It may be we never shall see you more; for we are resolved to behave so as our Brethren shall have no reason to be asha∣med of us.</Q></P>
<P>We must now return to Mr. <HI>De Nonville'</HI>s Army.</P>
<P>Mons. <HI>Champigni</HI> marched eight or ten Days before the rest of the Army, with between two and three hundred <HI>Canadiens.</HI> As soon as they arriv'd at <HI>Cedarackui,</HI> they surprized two Vil∣lages of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> that were settled about eight Leagues from that Place, to pre∣vent their giving any intelligence to their own Nation of the <HI>French</HI> Preparations, or the State of the <HI>French</HI> Army, as it was supposed they did in the last Expedition under Mr. <HI>De la Barre.</HI> These People were surprised when they least expected, and by them from whom they fear'd no harm, because they had settled there at the Invitation and on the Faith of the <HI>French.</HI> They were carried in cold Blood to the Fort, and ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to Stakes to be tormented

by the <HI>French Indians (Christians,</HI> as they call them) while they continued singing in their Country manner, and upbraiding the <HI>French</HI> with their Perfidy and Ungratitude. But the <HI>French</HI> Policy had no Compassion on these Miserable People, when they were resolved to destroy their whole Nation.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>De Nonville</HI> was at <HI>Cadarackui</HI> Fort, he had an Account that the <HI>Chicktaghicks</HI> and <HI>Twihtwies</HI> waited for the <HI>Quatoghies</HI> and <HI>Utawawas</HI> at <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">In the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eights between <HI>Ohswego Lake</HI> and <HI>Quatoghies Lake,</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lake St. Clair,</HI> with whom they design'd to March to the general Rende∣vouz at the Mouth of the <HI>Sennekas River.</HI> For this Expedition was chiefly design'd against the <HI>Sennekas,</HI> who had absolutely refused to meet Mr. <HI>De la Barrie,</HI> and were most firmly attached to the <HI>English.</HI> The <HI>Sennekas</HI> for this reason were design'd to be made Examples of the <HI>French</HI> Resentment to all the other Nations of <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The Messenger having assured the General, that it was time to depart, in order to meet the Western <HI>Indians,</HI> that came to his Assistance, he set out the 23d of <HI>June,</HI> and sent one part of his Army in Canoes, along the North Shoar, while he with the other part passed along the South, that no accidents of wind
<PB N="100" REF="002849_0109_0FE6772B28660698"/>
might prevent the one or the other reaching within the time appointed at the Place the <HI>Indians</HI> were to meet him. It happened, by reason of the good weather that both the Parties arrived on the same day, and joyned the Western <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Irondequat.</HI> As soon as the men were put on shoar, they hawled up the Canoes, and began a Fort, where 400 Men were left to guard the Canoes, and the Baggage. Here a young <HI>Canadien</HI> was shot to death, as a Deserter, for conducting the <HI>English</HI> into the Lakes, tho' the two Nations were not only at Peace, but their Kings in stricter Friendship than usual. But this Piece of severity is not to be wonder'd at, when the <HI>French</HI> were resolved to under∣take an unjust War, and every thing to put a stop to the <HI>English</HI> Trade, which now began to extend it self far into the Continent, and would in its consequence ruin theirs. The next day the Army began to march towards the chief Village of the <HI>Sennekas,</HI> which was only seven Leagues distant, every man carrying ten Biskets for his Provision. The <HI>Indian</HI> Tra∣ders made the Van with part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> the other part marched in the Rear, while the Regular Troops and Militia compos'd the main Body. The Army marched four Leagues the first day, without discovering any thing. The next day the Scouts advanced before the Army, as far as the corn Fields of
<PB N="101" REF="002849_0110_0FE6772D251AF278"/>
the Village, without seeing any body, tho' they passed within Pistol shot of 500 <HI>Sennekas▪</HI> that lay on their Bellies, and let them pass and repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, without disturbing them.</P>
<P>On the Report which they made, the <HI>French</HI> Marched with much haste, but little Order, in hopes to overtake the Women, Children and Old Men; for they no longer doubted of all being fled. But as soon as the <HI>French</HI> reached the foot of a Hill, about a quarter of a League from the Village, the <HI>Sennekas</HI> suddenly rais'd the War-shout, with a Discharge of their Fire-Arms. This put the Regular Troops, as well as the Militia into su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a Fright, as they marched through the Woods, that the Bat∣talions immediately divided, and run to the Right and Left, and in the Confusion fired upon one another. When the <HI>Sennekas</HI> per∣ceived their Disorder▪ they fell in among them Pell-mell, till the <HI>French Indians,</HI> more used to such Fights, gathered together and Re∣pulsed the <HI>Senn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kas.</HI> There were (according to the <HI>French</HI> Accounts) a hundred <HI>French-men,</HI> ten <HI>French Indians,</HI> and about foursc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re <HI>Sennekas</HI> kill'd in this Rencounter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>De Nonvelle</HI> was so dis-spirited with the Fright that his Men had been put into, that his <HI>Indians</HI> could not perswade him to pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue. He halted the remainder of that Day. The next day he Marched on with design to burn
<PB N="102" REF="002849_0111_0FE6772D4F6252F0"/>
the Village, but when he came there, he found the <HI>Sennekas</HI> had saved him the trouble; for they had laid all in Ashes before they Re∣tired; Two Old Men only were found in the Castle, who were cut into Pieces and boyled to make Soop for the <HI>French</HI> Allies. The <HI>French</HI> slaid five or six Days to destroy their Corn, and then marched to two other Villages, at two or three Leagues distance. After they had perform'd the like Exploits in those Places they return'd to the Banks of the Lake.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>French</HI> left the Lakes, they built a Fort of four Bastions at <HI>Oniagara,</HI> on the South side of the Streights, between <HI>Ohswego Lake</HI> and <HI>Cadarackui Lake,</HI> and left a hundred Men, with eight Months Provisions in it. But this Garrison was so closely blockt up by the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> that they all dy'd of Hunger, except seven or eight, who were ac∣cidentally reliev'd by a Party of <HI>French Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Western Indians</HI> when they parted from the <HI>French</HI> General, made their Har∣rangues, as usual, in which they told him with what Pleasure they saw a Fort so well placed to favour their Designs against the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and that they Relied on his never Finishing the War but with the Destruction of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> or Force∣ing them to abandon their Country. He assured them, that he would act with such
<PB N="103" REF="002849_0112_0FE6773578165660"/>
Vigour that they would soon see the <HI>Five Nations</HI> driven into the Sea.</P>
<P>He sent a Detachment of Soldiers to <HI>Teio∣dondoraghie,</HI> and in his Return to <HI>Canada,</HI> which was by the North side of the Lake, he left the same Number of Men and Quantity of Provisions at <HI>Cadarackui</HI> Fort.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> having got nothing but dry Blows, sent thirteen of the <HI>Indians</HI> that they surprized at <HI>Cadarackui,</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> as Trophies of their Victory, where they were put into the Galleys, as Rebels to their King.</P>

<P>COll. <HI>Dongan,</HI> who always had the <HI>Indian Affairs</HI> very much at heart, met the <HI>Five Nations</HI> at <HI>Albany</HI> as soon as possible after the <HI>French</HI> Expedition, and spoke to them on the 5th of <HI>August,</HI> in the following words, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren;</HI></P>
<P>I Am very glad to see you here in this House, and am heartily glad that you
<PB N="104" REF="002849_0113_0FE67735A2328058"/>
have sustain'd no greater loss by the <HI>French</HI> tho' I believe it was their Intention to de∣stroy you all, if they could have surpriz'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you in your Castles.</P>
<P>As soon as I heard of their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in to Way with you, I gave you Notice, and came up hither my self, that I might be ready to give all the Assistance and Advice that so short a time would allow me.</P>
<P>I am now about sending a Gentleman to <HI>England,</HI> to the King, my Master, to let him know, that the <HI>French</HI> have invaded his Territories on this side the great Lake, and War'd upon the Brethren, his Subjects. I would therefore willingly know, whether the Brethren have giver the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> any Provocation or not; and if they have, how, and in what manner, because I am oblig'd to give a true account of this matter. This business may cause a War between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, both in <HI>Europe</HI> and here, and therefore I must know the Truth.</P>
<P>I know the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> dare not enter into the great King of <HI>England's</HI> Territories, in a Hostile manner, without Provocation, if he thought the Brethren were the King of <HI>England'</HI>s Subjects; But you having two or three years ago, made a
<PB N="105" REF="002849_0114_0FE67737CB4A6950"/>
Covenant Chain with the <HI>French,</HI> contrary to my Command, (which I knew could not hold long) being void of it self among the <HI>Christians;</HI> for as much as Subjects (as you are) ought not to treat with any Fo∣reign Nation, it not lying in your Power, have brought this Trouble upon your selves, and, as I believe, is the only reason of their falling upon you at this time.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> I took it very ill, that after you had put your selves into the Number of the great King of <HI>England'</HI>s Subjects, that you should ever offer to make Peace or War without my consent. You know that we can live without you, but you cannot live without us. You never found that I told you a Lie, and I did offer your Assist∣ance as you wanted, provided that you would be advised by me; for I know the <HI>French</HI> better than any of you do.</P>
<P>Now since there is a War begun upon you by the Governor of <HI>Canada,</HI> I hope without any Provocation by you given, I desire and command you, that you hearken to no Treaty but by my Advice, which if you follow, you shall have the Benefit of the great Chain of Friendship between the great King of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, which came out of <HI>England</HI> the other day, and which I have sent to <HI>Canada</HI> by <HI>Anthony

Le <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unard;</HI> In the mean time I will give you such Advice as will be for your good, and will supply you with such Necessarys as you will have need of.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> My Advice is, that as many Pri∣soners of the <HI>French,</HI> as you shall take, that you draw not their Blood, but bring them home and keep them to Exchange for your People, which they have Prisoners already or may take hereafter.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> That if it be Possible, that you can order it so, I would have you take one or two of your wisest Sachems, and one or two chief Captains of each Nation, to be a Council to manage all Affairs of the War. They to give Orders to the rest of the Officers what they are to do, that your designs may be kept Private, for after it comes among so many People, it is Blazed abroad, and your designs are often frustrated. And those chief Men to keep a Corre∣spondence with me, by a Trusty Messen∣ger.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> Now the Great matter under Consideration with the Brethren, is, how to strengthen themselves, and weaken your Enemy. My Opinion is, that the Brethren should send Messengers to the <HI>Utawawas, Twihtwichs,</HI> and the farther <HI>Indians,</HI> and to send back likewise some of the Prisoners of

these Nations, if any you have left, to bury the Hatchet, and to make a Covenant Chain, that they may put away all the <HI>French</HI> that are among them, and that you will open a Path for them this way, They being the King of <HI>England'</HI>s Subjects like∣wise, only the <HI>French</HI> have been admitted to Trade with them, for all that the <HI>French</HI> have in <HI>Canada</HI> they had it of the Great King of <HI>England,</HI> that by that Means they may come hither freely where they may have every thing Cheaper than among the <HI>French.</HI> That you and they may joyn together against the <HI>French,</HI> and make so firm a League that whoever is an Enemy to one, must be to both.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> Another thing of Concern is, that you ought to do what you can to open a Path for all the <HI>North Indians</HI> and <HI>Mahikanders</HI> that are among the <HI>Utawawas</HI> and farther Nations: I will endeavour to do the same, to bring them home; for they not daring to return home your way, the <HI>French</HI> keep them there on purpose to joyn with the farther Nations against you, for your Destru∣ction; for you know, that one of them is worse than six of the others. Therefore all means must be used to bring them Home, and use them kindly as they pass through your Country.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="002849_0117_0FE6773CAC3594C8"/>
5<HI>thly,</HI> My Advice further is, That Mes∣sengers go in behalf of all the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to the <HI>Christian Indians</HI> at <HI>Canada,</HI> to perswade them to come Home to their Native Country, and to promise them all Protection. This will be another great means to weaken your Enemy; but if they will not be advised, you know what to do with them.</P>
<P>6<HI>thly,</HI> I think it very necessary for the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethrens Security and Assistance, and to the endamaging the <HI>French,</HI> to build a Fort upon the Lake, where I may keep Stores and Provisions, in case of necessity; and therefore I would have the Brethren let me know what Place will be most convenient for it.</P>
<P>7<HI>thly,</HI> I would not have the Brethren keep their Corn in their Castles, as I hear the <HI>Onnondagas</HI> do, but to bury it a great way in the Woods, where few People may know where it is, for fear of such an Accident as has happen'd to the <HI>Sennekas.</HI></P>
<P>8<HI>thly,</HI> I have given my Advice in your General Assembly by Mr. <HI>Dirk Wessels</HI> and <HI>Akus;</HI> the Interpreter, how you are to manage your Partys, and how necessary it is to get Prisoners, to exchange for your own Men that are Prisoners with the <HI>French.</HI> And I am glad to hear that the Brethren are so United, as Mr. <HI>Dirk Wessels</HI> tells me you
<PB N="109" REF="002849_0118_0FE6773F1265BB68"/>
are, and that there are no Rotten Members nor <HI>French</HI> Spyes among you.</P>
<P>9<HI>thly,</HI> The Brethren may remember my Advice which I sent you this Spring, Not to go to <HI>Cadarackui;</HI> if you had, they would have serv'd you as they did your People who came from Hunting thither; for I told you then, that I knew the <HI>French</HI> better than you did.</P>
<P>10<HI>thly.</HI> There was no Advice or Propo∣sition that I made to the Brethren, all the time that the Priest liv'd at <HI>Onondaga,</HI> but what he wrote to <HI>Canada,</HI> as I found by one of his Letters which he gave to an Indian to carry to <HI>Canada,</HI> but was brought hither. Therefore I desire the Brethren not to re∣ceive him or any <HI>French Priests</HI> any more, having sent for <HI>English Priests,</HI> with whom you may be supply'd to your Content.</P>
<P>11. I would have the Brethren look out sharp for fear of being surprised. I be∣lieve all the Strength of the <HI>French</HI> will be at their Frontier Places, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> at <HI>Cadarackui</HI> and <HI>Oniagara,</HI> where they build a Fort now, and at <HI>Trois Rivieres, Montreal</HI> and <HI>Chambly.</HI></P>
<P>12. Let me put you in mind again, not to make any Treatys without my Means, which will be more Advantagious for you, than your doing it by your selves, for then you will be look'd upon as the King of
<PB N="110" REF="002849_0119_0FE751AA73B64800"/>
<HI>England'</HI>s Subjects. And let me know, from time to time, every thing that is done.</P>
<P>Thus far I have spoken to you relating to the War.</P></Q>
<P>Then he chid them for their Breach of Faith with <HI>Virginia.</HI> He told them, that he was in∣form'd that last Spring they had kill'd a fine Gentleman, with some others, and that a Party of the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> was now there at the head of <HI>James River,</HI> with intention to destroy all the <HI>Indians</HI> there-about. They had taken six Prisoners, whom he order'd them to bring to him, to be Restored; and that for the future they should desist from doing any In∣jury to the People of <HI>Virginia</HI> or their <HI>Indians,</HI> otherwise all the <HI>English</HI> would unite to de∣stroy them. But at the same time he free'd the <HI>Sennekas</HI> from any blame, and commended them as a <HI>brave and honest People, who never had done any thing contrary to his Orders, except in making that unlucky Peace with the</HI> French <HI>three years a go.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> He recommended to them, Not to suffer their People to be Drunk, during the War<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A Soldier thereby (he said) looses his Reputation, because of the Advantages it will give the Enemy over him.</P>
<P>This honest Gentleman earnestly pursued the Interest of his Country; but, it seems, his Measures were not agreeable to those his
<PB N="111" REF="002849_0120_0FE6773F36449FB8"/>
Master had taken with the <HI>French</HI> King; for he had Orders to procure a Peace for the <HI>French,</HI> and was soon after this Removed from his Government. Indeed such an Active, as well as Prudent Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> could not be acceptable to the <HI>French,</HI> who had the Universal Monar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy in view, in <HI>America</HI> as well as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Coll. <HI>Dongan'</HI>s Message to Mr. <HI>De Nonville</HI> at a time when the Crowns of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> had so lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly entred into a strict Friend∣ship, had, no doubt, some Influence on the <HI>French</HI> Governor. But the little Success he had in his Expensive and Dangerous Expe∣dition, together with the Obstruction that the <HI>French</HI> Trade met with from the War, inclin'd him more effectually to Proposals of Peace, which Coll. <HI>Dongan</HI> was forced to make, and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Nations</HI> to yield to: For notwithstand∣ing Coll. <HI>Dongan'</HI>s Advice to them, as above related, he by his Masters Orders (who was entirely devoted to Bigotry and the <HI>French</HI> Interest) obliged the <HI>Five Nations</HI> to agree to a Cessation of Arms, and to deliver up their Prisoners without any Conditions, in order to obtain a Peace on such Terms as the <HI>French</HI> should agree to. And that no Accident might prevent, Mr. <HI>De Nonville</HI> sent his Orders to all his Officers in the <HI>Indian</HI> Countrys to observe a Cessation of Arms till the Ambassadors of the
<PB N="112" REF="002849_0121_0FE67745A2723108"/>
<HI>Five Nations</HI> should meet him at <HI>Montreal,</HI> as they had given him reason to expect in a little time, to conclude the Peace in the usual Form.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Adario,</HI> the chief of the <HI>Deonondadies,</HI> finding that his Nation was be∣come suspected by the <HI>French,</HI> since the time they had shown so much Inclination to the <HI>English</HI> when they attempted to Trade at <HI>Missi∣limakinak,</HI> Resolved by some brave Action against the <HI>Five Nations</HI> to recover the good Graces of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>For this Purpose he Marched from <HI>Missili∣makinak</HI> at the head of a hundred Men; and that he might act with more Security, he took <HI>Cadarackui</HI> Fort in his way for Intelligence: The Commandant informed him, that Mr. <HI>De Nonville</HI> was in hopes of concluding a Peace with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and expected their Embassadors in eight or ten days at <HI>Montreal</HI> for that purpose, and therefore desired him to return to <HI>Missilimakinak</HI> without attempting any thing that might Obstruct so good a Design.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> being surprized with this News, was under great Concern for his Nation, which he was afraid would be sacrificed to the <HI>French</HI> Resentment or Interest, but dissem∣bled his Concern before the <HI>French</HI> Officer. He went from <HI>Cadarackui,</HI> not to return home as the Commandant thought, but to wait for
<PB N="113" REF="002849_0122_0FE67745C7FACD08"/>
the <HI>Ambassadors</HI> of the 5 <HI>Nations</HI> near one of the Falls of <HI>Cadarackui River,</HI> by which he knew they must pass. He did not lurk there above four or five days before the unhappy Deputies came guarded by forty young Soldiers, who were all surprized &amp; kill'd or taken Prisoners. As soon as the Prisoners were all secured, the cunning <HI>Deonondadie</HI> told them <Q>That he having been enformed by the Governor of <HI>Canada,</HI> That Fifty Warriors of their Nation were to pass this way about this time, he had secured this Pass, not doubting of inter∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pting them.</Q></P>
<P>The Ambassadors being much surpris'd with the <HI>French</HI> Perfidy, told <HI>Adario</HI> the Design of their Journey, who, the better to play his part, seem'd to grow Mad and Furious, declaiming against Mr. <HI>De Nonville,</HI> and said, <HI>He would, some Time or other be Revenged of him for making a Tool of him to commit such horrid Treachery.</HI> Then looking stedfastly on the Prisoners (among whom <HI>Dekanesora</HI> was the Principal Ambassa∣dor) <HI>Adario</HI> said to them, <HI>Go my Brethren, I Unty your Bonds, and send you Home again, tho' our Nations be at War: The</HI> French <HI>Governor has made me commit so black an Action, that I shall never be easy after it till your</HI> Five Nations <HI>shall have taken full Vengeance.</HI></P>
<P>This was sufficient to perswade the Ambas∣sadors of the Truth of what he said, who
<PB N="114" REF="002849_0123_0FE677474029E690"/>
assured him, That he and his Nation might make their Peace when they pleased. <HI>Adario</HI> lost only one Man on this occasion, and would keep a <HI>Satana</HI> Slave, (adopted into the <HI>Five Nations</HI>) to fill up his place. Then he gave Arms, Powder and Ball to the rest of the Pri∣soners, to enable them to Return.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors were chiefly, if not all, <HI>Onnondagas</HI> and <HI>Oneydoes,</HI> who had been long under the influence of the <HI>French Priests,</HI> and still retain'd an Affection to them; but this Adventure throughly changed their thoughts, and irritated them so heartily against the <HI>French,</HI> that all the <HI>Five Nations</HI> from this time prose∣cuted the War unanimously.</P>
<P><HI>Adario</HI> deliver'd the Slave (his Prisoner) to the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Missilimakinak,</HI> who to keep up the Enmity between the <HI>Deonondadies</HI> and the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> order'd him to be shot to Death. As they carried him out, he related the whole of the Action, but the <HI>French</HI> thinking that he had only contrived it to save his Life, had no regard to it, till the fatal Consequences call'd his Dying Words to their Remembrance, with sorrowful Reflections.</P>
<P>The same Day that the <HI>Satana</HI> was shot, <HI>Adario</HI> call'd one of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> who had been long a Prisoner, to be an Eye-witness of his Country-mans Death, then bid him make his Escape to his own Country, to give an
<PB N="115" REF="002849_0124_0FE67747635BDD58"/>
Account of the <HI>French</HI> Cruelty, from which it was not in his Power to save a Prisoner he himself had taken.</P>
<P>This heighten'd the Rage of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> so that Mr. <HI>De Nonville'</HI>s sending to disown <HI>Adario</HI> in this Action, had no effect upon them: Their Breasts admitted of no thought but that of Revenge. It was not not long before the <HI>French</HI> felt the Bloody effects of this cruel Passion; for 1200 Men of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> invaded the Island of <HI>Montreal</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> had no suspicion of any such Attempt, while Mr. <HI>De Nonville</HI> and his Lady were in that Town. They Landed on the South side of the Island at <HI>La Chine,</HI> on the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 1688. where they burnt and sacked all the Plantations, and made a terrible Massacre of Men, Women and Children. The <HI>French</HI> were under apprehension of the Town's being attacked, for which reason they durst not send out any considerable Party to the Relief of the Country, till the <HI>Indians</HI> had blocked up two Forts, when Mr. <HI>De Nonvill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> sent out a hundred Soldiers and fifty <HI>Indians</HI> to try to bring off the Men. The <HI>French</HI> of this Party were all either taken or cut to pieces, except one Soldier and the Command∣ing Officer, who was carried off by twelve <HI>Indians</HI> that made their escape, after he had his Thigh broke. There was above a Thou∣sand
<PB N="116" REF="002849_0125_0FE6774D66B276B0"/>
of the <HI>French</HI> kill'd at this time, and Twenty six were carried away Prisoners, the greatest part of which were burnt alive. The <HI>Five Nations</HI> only lost three Men in this Ex∣pedition, that got Drunk, and were left be∣hind. This, however, did not satiate their Thirst after Blood; for in <HI>October</HI> following they destroy'd likewise all the lower part of the Island, and carried away many Prisoners.</P>
<P>The Consequences of these Expeditions were very dismal to the <HI>French,</HI> for they were forced to burn their two Barks which they had on <HI>Cadarackui Lake,</HI> and to abandon their Fort there. They design'd to have blown up their Works when they left that place, and for that end left a lighted Match where the Powder lay, but were in such a Fright, that they dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not stay to see what effect it had. They went down <HI>Cadarackui River,</HI> in seven Birch Canoes, and for greater Security travel'd in the Night. One of the Canoes with all the men in it was lost by their Precipitation, as they passed one of the Falls of that River. The <HI>Five Nations</HI> hearing that the <HI>French</HI> had deserted <HI>Cadarackui</HI> Fort, 50 <HI>Indians</HI> went and took Possession of it, who found the Match the <HI>French</HI> had left, which had gone out, and 28 Barrils of Powder in the same place, toge∣ther with several other Stores.</P>
<P>The News of the Success the <HI>Five Nations</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="002849_0126_0FE6774D8C6E3870"/>
had over the <HI>French,</HI> soon spread itself among all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and put the <HI>French</HI> Affairs every where into terrible Disorder.</P>
<P>The <HI>Utawawas</HI> had always shown an Incli∣nation to the <HI>English,</HI> and they therefore im∣mediately sent openly four Sachems with three Prisoners of the <HI>Sennekas</HI> that they had, to assure them, That they would forever Re∣nounce all Friendship with the <HI>French,</HI> and promised to Restore the rest of the Prisoners. They also included seven Nations that liv'd near <HI>Missilimakinak,</HI> in this Peace.</P>
<P>This put the <HI>French</HI> Commandant there un∣der the greatest Difficulty to maintain his Post; but there was no Choice, he must stand his Ground; for the <HI>Five Nations</HI> had cut off all hopes of Retiring.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciriniens</HI> and <HI>Kikabous,</HI> of all their Numerous Allies, only remain'd firm to the <HI>French,</HI> every one of the others endeavour'd to gain the Friendship of the 5 <HI>Nations,</HI> and would certainly have done it, by Massacreing all the <HI>French</HI> among them, if the Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur <HI>Perot</HI> had not with wonderful Sagacity and imminent Hazard to his own Person diverted them, for which <HI>Canada</HI> cannot do too much Honour to that Gentlemans Memory.</P>
<P><HI>Canada</HI> was now in a most Miserable Con∣dition; for while the greatest Number of their Men had been employ'd in the Expeditions
<PB N="118" REF="002849_0127_0FE6774FF9B0B128"/>
against the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and in Trading among the <HI>far Nations,</HI> and making New Discoveries and Settlements, Tillage and Husbandry had been neglected; now they lost several Thou∣sands of their Inhabitants by the continual Incursions of small Parties, so that none durs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hazard themselves out of the Fortified Places. Indeed, it is not ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie to conceive what Distress the <HI>French</HI> were then under; for tho' they were almost every where starving, they could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plant nor Sow, or go from one Village to another for Relief, but with imminent Danger of having their Scalps carried away by the Sculking <HI>Indians.</HI> At last the whole Country being laid Waste, Famine began to rage, and was like to have put a Miserable End to that Colony.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Indians</HI> had understood the method of attacking Forts, nothing could have pre∣served the <HI>French</HI> from an entire Destruction at this time. For whoever considers the state of the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs during this Period, How the <HI>Five Nations</HI> were divided in their Sentiements and Measures; The <HI>Onnon∣dagas, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Oneydoes,</HI> under the In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uence of the <HI>French</HI> Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uits, were diverted from prosecuting the War with <HI>Canada,</HI> by the Jesuits cunningly spiriting up those three Nations against the <HI>Virginia Indians,</HI> and per∣swading them to send out their Parties that
<PB N="119" REF="002849_0128_0FE677502466A638"/>
way: The <HI>Sennekas</HI> had a War at the same time upon their hands with three numerous <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> the <HI>Utawawas, Chicktaghicks</HI> and <HI>Twihtwies:</HI> And the Measures the <HI>English</HI> ob∣served with the <HI>French</HI> all King <HI>James'</HI>s Reign, gave the <HI>Indians</HI> rather grounds of Jealousy than Assistance. I say, whoever considers all these things, and what the <HI>Five Nations</HI> did actually perform under all these Disadvantages against the <HI>French,</HI> will hardly doubt that the <HI>Five Nations</HI> by themselves were at that time an over Match for the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>CANADA.</HI></P>
