<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are come from the General to acquaint you, that just now he received an Express, with Letters from <HI>Albany,</HI> which give him 
<PB N="4" REF="000674_0004_0FA99F63AD99D018"/>
an account of the weakness of that Garrison, and the growing strength <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Enemy.</P>
<P>We are further to acquaint you, That these delays of yours do very much hinder the necessary Affairs of their Majesties here: His Excel∣lency has no directions nor instructions from the King to make any applications to your selves; he has not publisht his Commission until he did it in this Court; nor could he suppose, neither will it be believed in <HI>England</HI> that an English Collony should deny the Rights of their Pro∣testant King.</P>
<P>The Letters from <HI>Albany</HI> do still intimate, That they are apprehensive that they will be attacked by the Enemy, and if that Post should be lost for want of your Complyance to their Majesties Commission, you may be sensible of what dangerous <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same would be to your selves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jarseys</HI> are under the same Circumstances with your selves, in respect of their Charter, yet have willingly submitted to the Kings plea∣sure and Right of the Millitia, who are commanded by his Excellency; the Governour of that Collony acts there without the least interrup∣tion: He calls Assemblies, makes Laws, raises Money, ordains and keeps Courts, only commands the Militia under his Excellency, who has not altered one single Officer in that Collony.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> We are to conclude with the last thing his Excellency gave us in charge, That the fatal Consequences of your Proceedures, as it appears to his Excellency, will be repented by you and your Posterity when 'tis too late: You are the only People in all the Kings Dominions that will venture to dispute with our King, who is a Souldier, concerning that inherent Right of the Militia, settled upon the Crown by several Acts of Parliament, and cannot be aliened nor demised.</P>
