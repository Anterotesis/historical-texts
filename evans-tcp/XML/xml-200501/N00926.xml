<HEAD>A Reply to Mr. Increase Mather's Remarks, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occasion of the Author of those Remarks, his publishing them in Print, was, as he declares in pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>That he was im∣portuned by some, who are scandalized by that Discourse, to anni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>advert upon it.</HI> To which I say, That on my thorow perusal of his Remarks, I do not find that he hath discovered any one thing therein that can be said to give any just scandal to any. The first part of my Sermon, that goeth before the Rules, he hath said nothing against, and in Charity I judge he hath nothing against it.</P>
<P>Pag. 1. Sect. 1. He saith, <HI>The Author, instead of keeping to his Text, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, hath obtruded upon us Notions of his own, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls</HI> Good Rules in Divinity, <HI>but every one of them, if not taken with grains of Salt, are unsavoury Divinity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Seeing all this is said, without proof, I shall not regard it, but recommend what is contained in those Rules to every well infor∣med Conscience of those that have read, or may happen to read them, (and who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall compare them with what he hath said against them, and with what I say in vindication of them) whether I have not well kept to my Text, and also to the Doctrine of the holy Prophets &amp; Apostles. <HI>If</HI> what <HI>I</HI> have delivered, as touching those Rules, taste Unsavoury to him, and others of his Taste, vitiated by the Prejudice of Education and Male <HI>I</HI>nformation, <HI>I</HI> am sorry for their Distemper; but neither his not any other Mens Taste whatsoever is the proper Test or Touch-stone, where-by to judge of true or false Rules i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Divinity, but the alone proper Test and Touch-stone in the case, is Gods holy Word contained in the holy Scriptures, to which, in this as in all other things of Re∣ligion, <HI>I</HI> submit to fair Tryal. But to make Mens Taste their Rule of Judgment, savours too much of <HI>Quakerism,</HI> as indeed do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few other things delivered by the Author in his Remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001109_0003_0FB04824EE1009B8"/>But before <HI>I</HI> further proceed, <HI>I</HI> desire the <HI>I</HI>mpartial Readers to observe a great inconsistency (as appears to me in the Author of those Remarks. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t, That in pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. he calls the Rules given by me, <HI>No∣tions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my own, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon them.—</HI> And yet, in pag. 2. he tells, <HI>That I have not said any thing out what</HI> crambe bis cocta, <HI>said by others, and has been answered more than Twenty Times.</HI> Now, how he can call those six Rules <HI>My own Notions I</HI> obtrude upon the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> and yet <HI>all of them said by others, before me, more than Twenty times, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> do not understand▪ for what we call a Mans own Notions, we commonly attribute to his own <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vention▪ However, <HI>I</HI> am glad the Author doth not give me the hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of inventing them, or of the first discovery of them, as indeed <HI>I</HI> am not; for as they are all well grounded on holy Scripture (notwithstanding what this Author hath said to the contrary) so <HI>I</HI> freely acknowledge <HI>I</HI> have found the Sub∣stance and Matter of them all in the Pious Works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divers Pious and Learned Teachers of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> to whose Piety and Learn∣ing <HI>I</HI> presume, in Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, the Author of the Remarks, will not com∣pare himself, in way of Equality. And what if these Rules have been above twenty times answered? so have good <HI>Protestant Principles</HI> of true Divinity maintained by the most Pious and Learned <HI>Protestant Writers,</HI> been above twenty times answered by <HI>popish Authors,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o as little purpose, and with as feeble Arguments as this Author of the <HI>Re∣marks</HI> has answered those six Rules. We are not to Notice, <HI>Quoties</HI> or <HI>quam Mult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> how oft or how much Men have answered to Books or Discourses that they dis-relish, but <HI>Quam bene et quam vere, i.e.</HI> how well and how truly.</P>
<P>Pag. 1. Whereas he saith, <HI>This Writer has not long since been famous for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrupting many in the Fundamentals of Religion, in which he has seen and renounced his Errors▪</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answer:</HI> That <HI>I</HI> am not at present conscious, nor do <HI>I</HI> remember that ever <HI>I</HI> corrupted any one in the Fundamentals of Religion, as they are commonly reckoned by <HI>Christian Protestant Authors,</HI> that is, such Doctrines of Faith and Precepts of holy Life as are essential and neces∣sary to Salvation, so as no Man can be saved without them; these are commonly reckoned Fundamental by Protestant Authors, and all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, all the Articles of the <HI>Apostles Creed,</HI> and all the Contents of the <HI>Decalogue,</HI> with many other Gospel Precepts, together with the
<PB N="5" REF="001109_0004_0FB04825E98253D8"/>
Promises and Threatning thereof, and also the Contents and Words of the <HI>Lords Prayer, I</HI> did Piously and Devoutly imbrace all the time of my being under the Profession of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and carefully taught them, in the time that <HI>I</HI> had a School, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Pennsilvania,</HI> to the School-Boyes, and caused them get them by heart; and <HI>I</HI> think it will be a work too hard for this Author, in any of my Books published by me, when under the Profession of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> to find that <HI>I</HI> had cor∣rupted any as touching one Fundamental of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> not only [as <HI>I</HI> humbly conceive] held <HI>all the Fundamental Articles and Precepts,</HI> as aforesaid, that may be called Fundamental, but also many others belonging to the Super str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cture, as the <HI>Integrals</HI> thereof; <HI>I</HI> do not say this to extenuate or excuse my too many Errors <HI>I</HI> was too much leavened with, which were Wood, Hay and Stubble <HI>I</HI> built on the Foundation; and <HI>I</HI> thank my most merciful and gracious God, that has given me both Eyes to see those Errors where withal <HI>I</HI> had been corrupted, and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d instrumental to corrupt others, and an heart to Repent of them, and freely to confess and Retract them, and be zealously concerned to Rescue others from them, so far, as by the bles∣sing and Grace of God <HI>I</HI> might be instrumental therein. But had <HI>I</HI> been guilty of the Author's Charge▪ it looks not so very Christian in the Author, that after <HI>I</HI> have found Grace of God to Repent of them, and his Merciful Forgiveness, [as <HI>I</HI> trust <HI>I</HI> have] to bring up my former Errors to Remembrance, with an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nuation as if my Repentance had not been sincere, or at least, that <HI>I</HI> have brought my self [since <HI>I</HI> left my former Errors] under a new Guilt of a very deep stain; for though he seems to praise me <HI>on the account of Renouncing my former Errors, as worthy of Commendation,</HI> yet he comes immediately after with a severe Sentence against me, saying, <HI>Nevertheless it seems by the Publi∣cation of his present pretended Sentiments, he arms at gaining a Reputation by endeavours to seduce other Men from the Truth, in matters relating to that Order of the Gospel which is of divine Institution.</HI> So that by his Uncha∣ritable account <HI>I</HI> am a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> still, for Preaching and publishing those six Rules. But since the ablest and best Men in the <HI>Church of England</HI> both for Piety and Learning, in neither of which the Author, <HI>I</HI> think, will presume to equal himself, [by his own confession] have taught and published those very Rules, he must either assoil me, or own those worthy Persons, as Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sanderson, &amp;c.</HI> and all those excel∣lent Divines of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> who have published those

Learned and Pious Treatises of the <HI>London Cases,</HI> of late collected into one Volumn, to be equally guilty with me, or rather far more guilty▪ by means of whom, <HI>I</HI> freely confess, <HI>I</HI> have been enlightned (as <HI>I</HI> hope also that God has internally enlightned me by his holy Spirit▪ to under∣stand, assent and believe them to be true and good, notwithstanding of all the Author's busling against them. But is the Author's Charity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scanty, that he will not allow others to differ from him so much as about what he himself calls the <HI>Circumstantials of Religion,</HI> as he is pleased to call those Rules, but presently he must pass Sentence upon them all▪ however so Pious and Learned, many or most of them have been, and are beyond him in Piety and Learning, as a company of <HI>Seducers, en∣deavouring to seduce Men from the Truth, in Matters relating to the Order of the Gospel, which is of divine Institution.</HI> At this rate not one Man shall differ from the Author, in what he calls the <HI>Circumstantials of Reli∣gion,</HI> but he shall stigmatize him with the infamous Character of a <HI>Seducer. I</HI> heartily with him and all his Brethren, of the same Alloy, more Christian Tenderness and Charity.</P>
<P>Pag. 2. After his having repeated the first Rule, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Whatsoever is enjoyned by our Superiors, if it contradict not Gods Commands in holy Scrip∣ture, ought for Conscience sake to be Obeyed, according to</HI> 1 Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 13, 14. Rom. 13. 5. Heb. 13. 7. 17. <HI>And if what they e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joyn is not made a Com∣mand of God, or an Article of Faith, or a Means of Grace;</HI> he adds, <HI>First, Such a Rule as this would do very well among</HI> Papists.</P>
<P><HI>I Answer:</HI> It would indeed do so very well among them, that it would in great part, if notwholly Reform them from Popery, and bring them over to true <HI>Christian</HI> &amp; <HI>Protestant Principles,</HI> did they well observe &amp; Practise it. <HI>I</HI> observe, it is a fault too frequent with such Men as this Author, to use this Policy, that what they cannot Refute with fair Ar∣gument, to brand it with <HI>Popery,</HI> as one hath fulsomly done, in that called, <HI>A brief Discourse concerning the Unlawfulness of the Common Prayer Worship,</HI> printed in <HI>New-England,</HI> supposed by some to be this Authors, which hath been, <HI>I</HI> judge, effectually answered by a Worthy Divine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> whose Answer I have read to my great Edifi-cations.</P>
<P>But what saith the Author to Refute the said first Rule? Why! <HI>It doth not very well agree</HI> (he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith) <HI>with the Apostles Rule, who taught Christians not to use their lawful liberty, when the use thereof cannot be with∣out
<PB N="7" REF="001109_0006_0FB0482770B6F668"/>
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndal,</HI> Rom. 14. 22. He saith further, <HI>That the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> implyes that the Determination of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Superiour will take away the six of Scandal, and make it a Duty for a Man to offend his Brother.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Nothing he here hath said doth in the least prove my Rule to be false; for the Limitations expressed in it, sufficiently guard it against This, and all his other Exceptions, which are Digressions from the proper Subject of Dispute. If what Superiors enjoyn give just cause of Scandal, all that is contradictory to what God commands, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> express Limitation in the Rule given. I suppose the Author is not so ignorant in the <HI>Casuist Divinity,</HI> but he has learned the distinction of of <HI>Scandal,</HI> into <HI>datum et acceptum, i.e.</HI> into <HI>Scandal given &amp; received:</HI> A Scandal may be received, and yet not justly given, and where it is not justly given by the Commands of Superiors, is renders them not guilty, nor their Commands unlawful.</P>
<P>As concerning his Authorities, quoted by him, out of Dissenters from the <HI>Church of England,</HI> I am not to regard them, where I find them not to agree with Scripture and right Reason, so shall not spend much time and Paper to answer to any of them, wheresoever scattered through his Book, though many of them, even as quoted by him as that of Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gillespy)</HI> make against him, and not for him; for what Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> saith, That <HI>Obedience is not due to Superior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when acting contrary to Edification</HI> &amp; <HI>Charity,</HI> doth nothing militate against either the <HI>first Rule</HI> or any of the <HI>six;</HI> for what is enjoyned contrary to Edification and Charity, doth contradict the Command of God, and so agreeth with the <HI>Rule</HI> that is given. As also, what Mr. <HI>Gillespy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, as quoted by him, maketh nothing against the said Rule, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That whatsoever Su∣periors command in such Matters, as any way appertain to the Eternal Wor∣ship of God, must be both Lawful in the Nature of it, and Expedient in the Use of it.</HI> The Author further adds, <HI>That the divine Law binds men to do no∣thing which is not for Edification,</HI> quoting for Proof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cor.</HI>6. 12. &amp; 14.26. All which is plainly contained within the Limitation expressed in the Rule, and therefore not contrary to it. Again, in answer to the Scrip∣tures cited by me, in proof of the above-said▪ Rule, he saith, <HI>Their Divines say, there is a difference between Subjection and Obedience, Sub∣jection may be where there is not Obedience.</HI> But what says this against the <HI>Rule</HI> given? Though all Subjection is not active Obedience, yet all Active Obedience is Subjection▪ Can the Author be so ignorant to think that in those Scriptures quoted by me, in proof of the <HI>first Rule,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001109_0007_0FB0482A30AEB908"/>
Active Obedience to Superio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, in things lawful, is not required, but only and alone Passive Obedience, or a subjection to Punishment? This would make the Commands of Superiors universally Cruel, and the Condition of their Subjects very Miserable.</P>
<P>Next, whereas he saith, pag. 4. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her the thing required be so,</HI> (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> for Edification) <HI>every Man has liberty to examine by the Judgment of Dis∣cretion;</HI> for which he quotes <HI>Davenant</HI> [a worthy Doctor and Bishop of the <HI>Church of England</HI>] But what, or how, doth this make against the Rule above given, which the said Bishop himself did own as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound and good? <HI>I</HI>t is not questioned by any true Protestant, but readily affirm∣ed, that every Man has liberty to examine, by the <HI>judgment of Discre∣tion,</HI> whatever is required of him; but his <HI>Judgment of Discretion</HI> must be no Rule to others, nor indeed to himself; but his <HI>Judgment of Dis∣cretion</HI> should have for its Rule, the <HI>Word of God</HI> contained in the holy Scriptures, and right Reason; for it oft happens that Mens <HI>Judgment of Discretion</HI> is Erroneous, and the dictate of an Erring Conscience. Wherefore, it is only safe for all, both Superiors and Inferiors, to submit their <HI>Judgment of Discretion</HI> to the <HI>Rule of holy Scripture</HI> and <HI>Right Reason,</HI> which will never disagree.</P>
<P>And whereas he saith, <HI>Mr.</HI> Keith <HI>designing to exalt the Churches Au∣thority, alledgeth</HI> Heb. 13. 7. <HI>Doubtless his meaning is, That in things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forbidden by the divine Law, the Commandments of Bishops must be obeyed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That is doubtless my meaning, for the very words of the <HI>Rule</HI> plainly import it. But <HI>I</HI> find nothing to the purpose either of Argument or good Authority, that he saith against it. What the Author quotes out of Dr. <HI>Richard Smith</HI> his Recantation, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That Bishops and Ministers have no Authority in making Laws and Decrees, be∣sides Gods Word, I</HI> reckon may charitably be construed, in Opposition to <HI>Popery,</HI> to mean such Laws and Decrees as Popes and Popish Councils commonly make, both against Gods Word, and besides it, as if they were Commands of God, or Articles of Faith, or Means of Grace; all which the <HI>first Rule</HI> expresly provides against. That St. <HI>Paul</HI> as an Ecclesiastick Person had Power to command what the divine Law did neither command nor for bid, see <HI>Philemom</HI> v. 8. &amp; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 12.</P>
<P>But whereas he doth peremptorily affirm, <HI>That it belongs to Christ alone to appoint Laws for the Government of his Church.</HI> If he mean such Laws as primarly and by themselves immediately bind the Conscience, and concern the <HI>substantial part</HI> of the Government of the Church, I
<PB N="9" REF="001109_0008_0FB0482C41FEAE60"/>
grant; which nothing militates against the above given <HI>Rule.</HI> But that our Superiours, both Ecclesiastick and Civil, have not power to make Laws and Rules in <HI>Circumstantials,</HI> that do not bind the Con∣science primarly and immediately by themselves, he has not in the least proved, but takes it for granted without all Proof, and contrary to all good Reason and common Practice of all Christian Societies. For the Laws of Christ in Scripture, many of them being general, in order to their being the better understood, and obeyed, require some particular Rules made by Superiours, and even by the Community, where the Community is a <HI>Democracy</HI> (such as <HI>I</HI> guess these called <HI>Independent Churches</HI> generally are, or at least very near to, in resemblance (which sort of <HI>Democracy</HI> in a Christian Church, <HI>I</HI> can no where find in holy Scripture) even the said Community gives Laws and Rules, binding not only the Makers of them, but their Children and Successors after them, that had no hand in the making of them. For it is hardly pos∣sible that any Society, whether Ecclesiastick or Civil, can consist with∣out several <HI>Rules</HI> determining such particular Circumstances, as to Times, Places and Persons, which general Laws of Scripture do not determine, as, <HI>To meet for Religious Worship at such Places and Times, Who, or What Persons shall be Past<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of such a Congregation;</HI> and many other Cases of great and weighty Circumstances. And upon a very slender Search, I think it will be easie to find, that these called <HI>Indepen∣dent Churches</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and else-where, have Laws and Rules among them, which they as really and severely impose on all that come in to them, after such Laws are made by the Community, as any other do, insomuch that who will not submit to them, are not to be received into their <HI>Community;</HI> and among other things, that called by them their <HI>Church Covenant,</HI> which they make a distinct thing from the <HI>Baptismal Covenant,</HI> and to be sure widely distinct from <HI>Episcopal Confirmation,</HI> not only <HI>I,</HI> but many Thousands of good Christians cannot find any Warrant for it in Scripture, by the best <HI>Judgment of Discretion</HI> that we can make; but on the contrary, we not only think it <HI>superfluous,</HI> but more burdensom to our Consciences, should we submit to it, than all the <HI>Ecclesiastick Canons,</HI> on the <HI>supposition</HI> that they were as Unprofitable to Edification as the Author and his Brethren render them to be. Besides, as to the time and manner of receiving the Lords Sup∣per, do ye not make some Law or Rule when the Congregation is to receive it, as at or before Noon, or some time before Night, though at
<PB N="10" REF="001109_0009_0FB0482D65E96220"/>
its first Institution it was practised at Night, and after the Passover Supper? And do ye not as much impose it on your People, that they should not kneel at the receiving the Lords Supper, but sit, as ye think the <HI>Church of England</HI> imposes it no her Members to Kneel? And why do ye not allow or practise your Males sitting with their Hats upon their Heads at the Communion Table? Do ye not hold this Practice of Mens sitting at the Communion Table with their Hats on their Heads in time of receiving, a very indecent Practice, as I have heard some <HI>Independents</HI> confess? And suppose a great Number of a Congregation should begin to receive with their Hats upon their Heads, or lying on their sides, would ye not think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to make some Law or Rule against it? This is but a hint in a few things, instead of many more that might be objected in your own Discipline. Which, if they have not sufficient weight to you, No more, but indeed far less has what ye object against the Commands of Our Superiors to us, as touch∣ing the <HI>Circumstantials</HI> of either Religious Worship or Church Go∣vernment. Besides, Ye have no Command in Scripture enjoyning you to sing <HI>Davids Psalms</HI> in Meeter and Rhyme (the putting them into Rhyme being altogther done by Humane Art) your ground then of doing it must either be a Law made among you, or such a constant Custom as is equivolent to a Law. And if no Law be warrantable but what is commanded by Christ, as to <HI>Circumstantials</HI> of Worship and Discipline in the Church, by the like Reason, or rather by greater Reason, ye may argue against all Customs not commanded by Christ in the holy Scriptures. And why do ye not read the holy Scripture in your Congregations, which are given for Mens Instruction to be read and heard in Publick, as well as in Private? I think ye had much better agree to make it a Law, that every time the Congregation meets, One Chapter, at least, of the Old Testament should be read, and another of the New, and that in good Order, than to neglect it, as ye ge∣nerally do, One only Congregation at <HI>Boston</HI> excepted, as <HI>I</HI> am inform∣ed. Now though the reading of the holy Scriptures in Publick is well warranted by Holy Writ, yet <HI>What,</HI> or <HI>How Much</HI> ought to be read every day the Congregation meets, the Scripture determines not, and therefore in This, as in Other the like Cases, Ecclesiastick Superiors may give Laws or Rules, What is to be done, according to the Limi∣tations given in the <HI>first Rule.</HI></P>

<P><HI>That whatever Church holds the Fundamentals of the Christian Religion, and has the Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Preached, and the Sa∣craments of</HI> Baptism<HI>and the</HI> Lords Supper <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Administred, such a Church is a True Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, and to seperate from such a Church in external Communion▪ and in external Acts of Worship, is a sin, the which sin is the sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Schism.</P>
<P>In the first place, he saith, <HI>It is evident by these words that</HI> G.K. <HI>has not attained unto the true Notion of a Schism. According to him</HI> (meaning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.K.) <HI>Schism consists in a Separation from a true Church in external Acts of Worship; but according to Scripture, Men may be guilty of Schism, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld external Communion with the Church where they have made a Schism,</HI> instancing <HI>Corah</HI> in the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the <HI>Schismaticks</HI> in the Church at <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answer:</HI> Here he fights against his own Shadow, and not against the <HI>Second Rule</HI> laid down in my Sermon. <HI>I</HI> did not give the full and entire Notion of <HI>Schism</HI> in that Rule, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had I any occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to do; it is sufficient to justifie the Truth of the Rule, That whoever seperate from a Church <HI>so qualified,</HI> as <HI>I</HI> have described in that second Rule, are guilty of <HI>Schism;</HI> though it is confessed that Persons may also be guilty of <HI>Schism</HI> in divers Cases, who hold external Communion together; for there are divers parts and degrees of Schism, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only touched at one part.</P>
<P>But to make the <HI>Second Rule</HI> seem false, he quotes again only about two Lines and a half of it, as it stands in his <HI>Printed Remarks,</HI> and argues against it; whereas had he argued against the <HI>Second Rule,</HI> as entirely considered, there would have been no place for his Objections, as, <HI>first,</HI> where he instances, <HI>If false Doctrine be imposed, instead of true.</HI> 2dly. <HI>If a true Church walk disorderly, and not hearken to the Admonitions of those that would reclaim them from the Error of their way.</HI> For if he mean that the whole Church be guilty of those things, the Qualifica∣tions expresly given in the second Rule secure it sufficiently against his two Objections, as they do against the other two following, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 3<HI>dly, That it is not only lawful, but a Duty to seperate from the Church of</HI> Rome.
<PB N="12" REF="001109_0011_0FB0482EC4BA24E0"/>
I cannot but wonder at the Author's inadvertency here, for waving that Question, <HI>Whether the present Church of</HI> Rome <HI>be either a true Church or a Church Vera,</HI> though not <HI>Vera.</HI> The present state of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> doth altogether disagree with the Qualifications of the Church given in the Second Rule, which are, <HI>That she has the Word of God duly Preached, and the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper duly admi∣nistred;</HI> None of which due Qualifications will the Author dare to say the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath; and therefore in this <HI>Third,</HI> as well as in his <HI>Fourth,</HI> he hath discovered his great Inadvertency, as where he saith, <HI>It is possible that a true Church may impose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its Members Unlawful Terms of Communion.</HI> I say, in that case, <HI>She ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not the Word of God duly Preached, nor the Sacraments duly administred.</HI></P>
<P>But to make his matter seem the more pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sible, he leaves objecting against the second Rule, and falls upon accusing the <HI>Church of England, That she Imposes on her Members U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>wful Terms of Communion.</HI> But as I know no such Things that the doth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o whether the doth so or not, are wholly beside the present subject of Dispute: And as for his several Instances of such Impositions, they are all easily answered; but I refer the Reader to that Treatise, called, <HI>A brief Discourse concerning the Lawfulness of Worshipping God by Common-Prayer,</HI> and other Treatises of Pious and Learned Writers in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> that have Piously &amp; Learnedly answered to all his Objections, or any others of the the like Nature. But as his Objections against the <HI>Church of England</HI> are a wide Digression from the present subject of Dispute contained in the Second Rule, which mentions not one word of the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> so should I answer him, as he thus widely digresses from the proper subject, <HI>I</HI> should be guilty of the same fault.</P>
<P>But whereas he saith, <HI>One of the first things in the Liturgy is Mathema∣tically false, for it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iveth a Rule for the finding of</HI> Easter-Day <HI>forever, at fallible as Mr.</HI> Keith'<HI>s Rules of Divinity.</HI> Passing his <HI>Sarcasme</HI> against what he calls <HI>My Rules in Divinity,</HI> none of which he hath proved either false or fallible, for all his attempt, <HI>I</HI> think it very rashly and inconsiderately done by him, to say, <HI>That one of the first Things in the Liturgy is Mathematically false,</HI> to wit, <HI>the Rule given in the Liturgy for finding Easter-Day forever;</HI> and for this to give no Proof but his bare Affirmation. Besides, in so doing he presumes to be more skillful in the Mathematical Sciences than they who gave that Rule, and continue to practise it. But I think to persons but ordinarily skilled in the Ma∣thematicks,
<PB N="13" REF="001109_0012_0FB0482F60269B28"/>
it will appear by the Author's Charge against the Rule, about finding <HI>Easter,</HI> that he is very unskillful in the Mathematicks; and he cannot but know, that there are at present in the <HI>Church of England</HI> as good Mathematicians as the World affords, that could easily have discovered the Error of the said Rule, if it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Me∣thematically false. For to say the Truth, the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> have no∣thing to do with it, it hangs on no <HI>Mathematical Theoreme</HI> or <HI>Canon,</HI> but only on an <HI>Antient Practise</HI> or <HI>Sanction,</HI> ever since the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Council,</HI> that whereas the Equinoctial about that time happened upon the 21<HI>th Day of March,</HI> after which Equinoctial the <HI>Jews,</HI> under the Old Testa∣ment began the first Moneth, and the 14<HI>th Day</HI> was the Day of the <HI>Passover,</HI> counting from the first New Moon after the said Equinoctial, the Atient <HI>Latine Church,</HI> that it might not seem to <HI>Judaise,</HI> did keep the <HI>Christian Easter,</HI> not precisely on the fourteenth Day of the Moon or Moneth, but on the <HI>Lords Day</HI> following. Now though the <HI>Equi∣noctial</HI> has gone back from the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>th Day of March</HI> to the <HI>Tenth of March,</HI> now, as in our present Age, and as the World continues, may go back, after some Tract of time, to the <HI>first of March,</HI> and so still backwards; yet this is no Error in the Rule for finding <HI>Easter,</HI> either Mathematically or otherwise; and none will or can so say, but he who is extreamly ignorant in all true Mathematicks.</P>
<P>But perhaps he has some other Reasons, that are as weak as the former, for I remember <HI>I</HI> have read objected by some Dissenters, <HI>That Easter-Day, in some year past, in the Church Kalander, did not answer to the Day of</HI> Easter <HI>in some Astronomical Almanack.</HI> Which was nothing else but a plain instance of those mens Ignorance how to distinguish betwixt the <HI>Astronomical</HI> and <HI>Civil beginning</HI> of the Day, the Astrono∣mical beginning of the Day being at Noon, &amp; the Civil at Mid Night. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Lastly,</HI> The ground of his Charge may possibly be, That according to the <HI>New-England Churches,</HI> the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> and all other Dayes begin at Sun-set or Evening. But this is more <HI>Jewish</HI> than <HI>Mathema∣tical,</HI> and the Mathematicks do in no part Contradict the Rule given in the Liturgy for finding <HI>Easter forever.</HI> And without changing that Rule, though the World should continue many Thousands of Years, the Time of <HI>Easter</HI> may be so fixed, as not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make any considerable difference, as to the Season of the Year wherein it falls, to wit, by adding one Day more to some Moueth of the Year, after the space of each <HI>Hundred and Thirty Years</HI> is expired.

further to Object, than what is mentioned here, let him in his next produce it, and I question not, but he will thereby, to the Intelligent, shew, That he had as little ground to object against the Rule in the Liturgy, for finding <HI>Easter,</HI> as against the Rules in Divinity given by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>

And were we ever to desirous to joyn with you in that most Solemn Act of receiving the Lords Supper with you, ye would not admit us, but exclude us, by imposing upon us

Your Church Covenant, whereby ye would bind us up from Commu∣nion not only with the Church of England, whereof we are Members, but from all other Protestant reformed Churches▪ Thus▪ what the Author chargeth most unjustly upon the Church of England, as, <HI>That she imposeth on her Members Unlawful Terms of Communion,</HI> is most justly chargeable upon him, and his Brethren; for we, with many others of tender Consciences, do look upon your <HI>Church Covenant</HI> to be very un∣warrantable and disagreeable to holy Scripture considering the rigor of it, in binding up the People that come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, from holding Com∣munion with other Protestant Churches, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in receiving the Lords Supper with them, but in noosing them up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Narrowness, that the People bound with your Church Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are scarcely, with∣out your severe Censure, so much as come and hear a good Sermon in any of our Churches, far less to joyn with us in the publick Prayers of the Church; This we think is a Yoak of Bondage ye put upon People, by which means ye have frighted away many of the People of <HI>New∣England</HI> from joyning with you, and having had no where else to go, in many places, many of the young Generation, who are not within your Covenant, are little better than <HI>Heathens,</HI> and are exposed to be leavened with <HI>Quakerism,</HI> and other vile Errors, as too many already are so leavened these-with▪</P>
<P>This your <HI>Church Covenant</HI> (we think) is an heavy Yoak, which ye impose upon the People, both Ministers and Others, that hath no Warrant from Scripture; but Thanks be to God the <HI>Church of England</HI> layeth no such York upon her Members, but alloweth them full liberty to joyn in Communion with all true <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> who hold Communion with her, in <HI>Holland, France, Switzerland, Germany,</HI> and other parts.

<P>And notwithstanding of this Authors and his Brethrens great Cla∣mour against <HI>Impositions, of things not commanded in Scripture,</HI> We find Them much more for <HI>Impositions,</HI> than those against whom they so complaint and indeed it is very ordinary, that none are more for <HI>Impositions</HI> upon <HI>Others,</HI> than they who yet cry out against i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon <HI>Themselves.</HI> For, does not your Church impose (at times) Days of <HI>Fast</HI> upon People, which if they do not observe, though they are not of your Church, ye will be severe upon them?</P>

<P><HI>What things we see amiss in particular Persons, are not to be charged upon the whole Church, unless the Church do Justifie those Persons in those Things; and what we cannot amend, we ought to bear; for there is no Christian Society on Earth but has some particular Persons that do amiss; and all Dissenters, when parti∣cular Failings of particular Persons are objected to them, give the like Excuse.</HI></P>
<P>Now the streined Sense which he puts upon the words of it, is this, That by <HI>Justifying,</HI> I mean an <HI>avowed defending of Scandalous Criminals,</HI> at least he is very jealous that I so meant it, otherwise why should he find fault with this <HI>Third Rule?</HI> The Author cannot be ignorant, that <HI>Not to justifie,</HI> doth several times in Scripture signifie not only <HI>not to defend</HI> or <HI>approve,</HI> but severely to Censure and blame, as where <HI>Job</HI> said to his Friends, <HI>God forbid that I should justifie you,</HI> and where God is said, <HI>Not to clear or justifie,</HI> (as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> doth bear it) <HI>the Guilty, i. e.</HI> He doth severely censure and judge them; and like that of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians, Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not, i. e.</HI> I greatly dispraise and blame you. All which is said by a <HI>Rhetorical Figure</HI> frequent in Scripture, as well as in other Writers, called, <HI>A Meiosis,</HI> where something more is understood than is expressed. And that my plain meaning was, That scandalous Persons, who gave pub∣lick Scandal, are not only Not to be defended or connived at, but that they are to be publickly censured &amp; a due Testimony born against them, is evident from my saying, <HI>That all Dissenters, when particular Failings of particular Persons are objected to them, give the like excuse.</HI> And <HI>All Dis∣senters</HI> include the <HI>New-England Independents</HI> as well as others, who profess, That scandalous Persons ought not only Not to be defended, but to be duly Censured, and a due Testimony born against them. And the Author knows in his Conscience, That <HI>The Discipline of the Church of England requires this:</HI> He had therefore no just reason to object against the Third Rule. But where he cannot find a fault, in this
<PB N="17" REF="001109_0016_0FB048329E1153A0"/>
or any of the Rules, it seems he was resolved to make one, and to set up a shadow of his own, and fight against it. But suppose a Church is r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in due censuring scandalous Persons, though this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a great fault in her, as it was in the Church of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Thyatira,</HI> yet that fault did not Unchurch them, nor justifie the Seperation or with-drawing of Members from them in external Acts of Worship.</P>
<P>But when the Author cannot find sufficient matter against this <HI>Third Rule,</HI> (the only proper subject of the Dispute) he preceeds after his former manner to inveigh against the <HI>Church of England,</HI> for her neg∣lect of Discipline: Though in many places good Discipline is used in her (praised be God) and there are as many good Christians eminent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound Faith and good Life in her Congregations as in any Church upon Earth, comparing Number with Number, and where it is otherwise, I pray God it may be amended. But as want of Discipline in some particular Places and Congregations, is no Refutation of the Rule given, so nor is it any just Cause of Seperation from the Church: And dare the Author say, there is no want or neglect of due Discipline in the <HI>Churches of New-England?</HI> And are all the Failings of particular Persons amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g them duly censured? And is a due Witness publickly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against them? Have they ever to this day born a publick Testimony against the Severity and Cruelty of these who hanged three <HI>Quaker Men</HI> and One <HI>Quaker Woman?</HI> and if any few did blame it, how long were they silent, and did rather approve it than Condemn it? <HI>Or,</HI> have they born a due Testimony against these of their Churches that caused ptu many Innocent Persons to Death for Witches? And hath the Author himself born a due Testimony against the unfound Doctrine of Mr. <HI>Samuell Willard,</HI> President of the Colledge at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> who, at the publick Commencement there the first day of <HI>July</HI> last, did openly defend that Position, <HI>That</HI> Adams <HI>Fall was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before all time, and by his Deter∣mination in Time, of</HI> Adam'<HI>s Will to sin,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the rest of mens Actions; where-with not only I, but some of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were offended.</P>

<P>But that he might more severely and uncharitably reflect upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he saith, pag. 14. <HI>The Discipline of Christ is be∣come a Pecuniary Business in the Church of</HI> England, <HI>as well as in the Church of</HI> Rome. If the Author has not writ this against his Conscience and Conviction (as ▪hope, in charity, he hath not) he has shewed his great <HI>I</HI>gnorance and Rashness in condemning her at the rate he doth, and equelling her, in a manner, with the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in the Sin of <HI>Simony,</HI> it having passed as a Proverb among Travellers, who have been at <HI>Rome, Omnia sunt venalia</HI> Romae, <HI>All things may be sold, or are to be sold at</HI> Rome; But dare the Author say, with a good Conscience, that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> where <HI>Simony</HI> is judged a horrid Crime, and abhorred by many Thousands of that Church; indeed, generally it is so; but if some do most hypocritically practise it in secret, when they are found out, are severely punished for it. This is no good Argument against the lax Discipline of the Church; but that it is severely punished, when discovered, is a good argument for her Discipline being so far good. Besides that, the Antient Discipline of the Church was severe upon the Deserters of it, &amp; such as did seperate and make a Schism there from; the which severe Discipline were it now, or but the half of it performed upon all the deserters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who have without all just cause gone from her) of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> the Author would Cry as much against that Discipline, if restored, as <HI>Cruelty and Persecution,</HI> as now he doth cry out against the Church for the want of it.</P>

<P><HI>To joyn in external Acts of publick Worship, where the Matter is sound, though there be a great Mixture of Unsound Members, with others sound, is no sin, but our Duty, for which we are warranted by the Practice both of the Prophets and Apostles,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He saith, <HI>This Argument, though often urged, is not Cogent.</HI> But how does he prove that it is not Cogent? Is his bare Authority or Word a sufficient Proof against the Rule, which was the main subject of the Dispute, as stated by himself? for I find not that he gives any other Proof, only to divert his Reader from the proper subject, he tells, <HI>That it is controverted among learned Men, whether there were any Eccle∣siastical Discipline in the</HI> Jewish <HI>Church, in respect of Moral Offences;</HI> but however, the Author himself affirms, that <HI>Heresies</HI> (and to be sure they are great Moral Evils and Offences) were censurable among them. And this is all he saith against the Fourth Rule, which is just nothing. But when all his Shot is spent against the Fourth Rule, after his wonted manner, he makes a fresh Assault upon the <HI>Church of England,</HI> so that his Spleen is mainly against her; and were but the Rules as much in favour of the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> called, <HI>Independents,</HI> its very like he could swallow them all down very kindly, and easily digest them. He tells us, That <HI>I cannot but know, that the Dissenters from the</HI> Church of England <HI>find fault with some particulars in the matters of the Worship required in the</HI> Liturgy. <HI>They verily believe that such things are therein commanded, as God has forbidden; whether they are Mistaken in their Judgment, the day will declare it.</HI> And then he has a Hit at the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of the Church of England, telling us, <HI>That the Non-Confor∣mists believe that they are forbidden in the second Commandment.</HI> But what is here of real Argument either against the fourth Rule or the Church? What this Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, or that Man saith or believeth, is no good Proof whether a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e true or false, except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e bring Scripture or good Reason for him. He saith, <HI>He will not dispute that point which hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so elaborately handled by many others.</HI> But why then does he bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up to cast blame on the Church? We know that many Pious and Worthy

Divines of the <HI>Church of England</HI> have more truly and more elaborately also answered all their Arguments against what they call the <HI>Ceremonies of the Church of England.</HI> But have the <HI>New-England Independents</HI> no Ceremonies among them, that is, no things that they use relating to Circumstantials of Worship or Religion, but what is contained in Scripture? Have they nothing of <HI>Humane Institution</HI> among them? Dr. <HI>Saywell,</HI> in a Book of his, in answer to Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> and Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> saith, <HI>He knoweth but One Ceremony in the Church of</HI> England, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Use of the Sign of the <HI>Cross after Baptism,</HI> which has no more Idolatry or Superstition in it, than for a Man in Writing to write a Roman X to stand for the word <HI>Cross;</HI> for the word <HI>[Cross]</HI> it self, is but a Sign, as all words are, <HI>Verba sunt signa rerum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conceptum,</HI> i. e. <HI>Words are Signs of Things and of Thoughts,</HI> say all Logicians. But after that he hath cryed out against the <HI>Church of England</HI> for using the <HI>Sign of the Cross after Baptism,</HI> he brings not the least Reason to prove it <HI>sinful,</HI> only tells us, That <HI>Non-conformists</HI> complain of the Sign of the Cross <HI>in Baptism,</HI> as a corrupting addition to an Ordinance of divine Worship. But he should have said, [<HI>after Baptism</HI>] and not [<HI>in Baptism</HI>] for the Church of England makes not the Sign of the Cross any <HI>part of Baptism;</HI> and therefore it is not [<HI>in it</HI>] but [<HI>after it</HI>] and many are baptized in the Church of England daily, who are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all signed with the Sign of the Cross, to wit, such sick infants who are baptized in their Parents Houses, many of which dye before they could be brought to Church, and yet are esteemed truly baptized, and true and real Members of the Church.</P>
<P>Again, He first blames the Church of England <HI>for kneeling at the Lords Supper,</HI> and yet with the next Breath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith as much as doth clear her for he grants, p. 16. <HI>That the Church doth declare that Christ is not Bodily present in the Sacrament; and that the Bread is not real Christ; for which cause</HI> (he saith <HI>many that do kneel, do not violate their Consciences.</HI> But why not [all] as well as [many] who are sound in the Faith of the Church of England? for if any do not believe as the Church of England declares, they are not of her.</P>
<P>But why doth he make all this Cry against the <HI>Church of England</HI> for holding, <HI>That to joyn in external acts of Worship, where the matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sound, though there be a great Mixture of unsound Members, with others Sound, is no Sin, but Duty?</HI> Have they of the <HI>New-England Independents</HI> no Un∣sound Members among them? yea, do they not joyn, and allow others
<PB N="21" REF="001109_0020_0FB048363875FAC0"/>
to joyn with them in external Acts of Worship, as Prayer and Singing who are no Members of their Church, and many of which are known to be Unruly Walkers? Their own Practice therefore doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Rule, notwithstanding he is so set against it.</P>
<P>In his disputing against the <HI>Fifth Rule,</HI> he is as weak, as against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the former. The Rule is this:</P>
<P><HI>What things soever were commended of God or allowed and practised lawfully under the Old Testament, that were neither any part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ceremonial Law, nor of the Jewish Polity, peculiar to that Nation, are still binding to Us under the New Testament; and a proof out of the old Testament in all such Cases is as good as a Proof out of the New.</HI></P>
<P>Now what saith he against this? Surely nothing to prove the Rule to be false; for what things were either commanded or permitted to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that are not lawful, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary to us, were either parts of the <HI>Ceremonial Law,</HI> or belonged to the <HI>Politie</HI> of the Jewish Nation, as that of <HI>Poligamy</HI> and <HI>Divorce</HI> (except in the case of Adultry) To <HI>Pray with their Head or face covered,</HI> was part of the Cere∣monial Law. Concerning <HI>putting off their Shoes</HI> when they entered into the Synagogue, if they had any such Practice, he but very weakly proves it from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 5. 1. I no where find it commanded to the People of <HI>Israel;</HI> if it was a Custom among them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et had no Command of God to warrant it, as he has showed none, This makes against him, That Customs may be lawfully used in the Church, and have no Com∣mand of God in particular; which is contrary to the mind of the Author, of Whom it may be said both here, and oft else-where, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> se jugulavit gladio,</HI> i. e. <HI>He hath slain himself with his own Sword.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI>n Opposition to the fifth Rule, he saith, <HI>They may a firm two things,</HI> first, <HI>That the Apostacy of the Christian Church has consisted partly in its Judaizing.</HI> But how this is any Proof against the fifth Rule, I see not, nor can any other Man that has his true sight. Do Christians Judaize, if they practise neither what was Ceremonial, nor what was only proper and peculiar to the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> but only what was either commanded or allowed by the Moral Law, and some other positive
<PB N="22" REF="001109_0021_0FB04837124C8A30"/>
Precepts? I cannot but oft wonder at the Author's Inadvertency▪ He mentions the Observation of <HI>Easter,</HI> and some <HI>Holy Dayes</HI> that were observed among the <HI>Jews;</HI> and that they had <HI>Musick</HI> in their Temple Worship, and the Priests had <HI>Holy Garments</HI> to distinguish them from others; and from this he infers, That the <HI>Church of England</HI> doth Judaize in observing the Christian Feast of <HI>Easter,</HI> and other <HI>Christian Festivals,</HI> and having <HI>Musick</HI> in their <HI>Cathedrals,</HI> and some other places. But he has made no Essay to prove his Consequence, which is with as good Authority denyed, as by him affirmed. And why did he not as well argue, <HI>That because the</HI> Jews <HI>heard the</HI> Old Testament <HI>read in their Synagogues and in the Temple, and</HI> Prayed <HI>and</HI> sung Psalms, <HI>that therefore it is</HI> judaizing <HI>for the</HI> Church of England <HI>to either Pray or Sing in their Congregations, or to hear the Old and New Testament read in their Assem∣blies.</HI> This last, it seems, they think <HI>Judaizing,</HI> and therefore do not practise it; only (as <HI>I</HI> am informed) Mr. <HI>Colmans</HI> Church at <HI>Boston</HI> hath the Scriptures read in it, which I suppose the <HI>Independent Brethren</HI> do reckon not only <HI>Judaizing</HI> in them so to do, but coming too near to a <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>Church of England.</HI> The Author should better know or at least consider, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like Practises, when done on different Reasons, and to different Ends,</HI> the one may be good and justifiable, the other bad and condemnable. But is it not a rare Argument of the Author against the <HI>fifth Rule,</HI> that the <HI>Jews</HI> in Swearing, should say, <HI>By the Law I Swear?</HI> But did the Law permit or command any such thing? Surely Nay; and our Saviour taught the <HI>Jews,</HI> They were not to Swear by any Creature, <HI>But the</HI> Jews, <HI>when they Swear, did lay their hand on the Pentateneh.</HI> What then? we do not find that our Saviour did blame any of them for this, if they so did; nor can the <HI>Church</HI> be charged with <HI>Judaizing,</HI> for allowing her Members to lay their hand on the Bible when they Swear. He may as well argue, <HI>Quaker-like,</HI> That because <HI>Jews</HI> did Swear, therefore all Swearing under the Gospel is <HI>Judaizing;</HI> yea, and all Self-Defence by Carnal Weapons, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> say, &amp; argue with as much Strength as this Author doth against the <HI>Church of England</HI> for some aforesaid things, such as the <HI>Jews</HI> pra∣ctised, but on quite different Reasons, and to quite different Ends.</P>
<P>Pag. 20. Whereas I had affirmed, <HI>That Proofs out of the Old Testament are in all Cases as good as Proofs out of the New,</HI> which I brought as a Reason or Illustration of the <HI>Fifth Rule,</HI> the Author saith, <HI>No Man doubts of that, provided they be Proofs indeed, and not Scriptures Mis∣interpreted
<PB N="23" REF="001109_0022_0FB0483A4498FC98"/>
or Mis-applyed.</HI> And doth the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Rule</HI> import or imply any such thing, that <HI>Scriptures Mis-interpreted or Mis-applyed are good Proofs either out of the Old Testament or the New?</HI> Surely Nay: Therefore all this said by him is nothing to the purpose against the truth of the Rule. But this I throughout observe, that the Author, instead of proving the RULES to be false, which was his main Undertaking, he makes it his main Business to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight against the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as if by these very Rules he could prove Her to be such, that an good Christians should forsake her, and seperate from her, which at last confirms the goodness of the Rules, though against his own Will and Inclination. But if the Rules be all false, then he hath not done well to measure and try <HI>The Church of England</HI> by such false Rules, and so pass a Judgment against Her.</P>
<P>Pag. 20. But that he saith, <HI>It is only the New Testament that informs us what Officers, what Sacraments, what Censures are to be allowed of in Churches of Christians to the end of the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> If all this were granted, yet it saith nothing against the Truth of the <HI>fifth Rule.</HI> Besides, he but barely affirms it without Proof, <HI>That Only the New-Testament informs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of those things;</HI> for though they are more clearly Revealed in the New-Testament, yet under the Old Testament they were held forth in <HI>Promises, Prophecys, Types &amp; Figures,</HI> as well as Faith in Jesus Christ, and other Gospel Truths of greatest Moment.</P>
<P>Pag. 21. As to the <HI>Sixth</HI> and <HI>Last Rule,</HI> he seems to grant to it, in the case of <HI>Psalm-Prayers:</HI> But why not in the case of <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Thanks∣givings in Prose</HI> as well, seeing we have no command to put any part of our Prayers and Thanks-givings into Meeter of Rhyme, and sing them with Musical Tunes and Notes, and yet the <HI>Independent Churches</HI> do so, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>the Church of England,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> sappose enjoyn it to be done too. But, as I said in my Sermon, (which <HI>I</HI> find not that the Author has noticed) <HI>Why singing with the Book</HI> (a thing practised by many Dissen∣ters) <HI>in consistent with singing with the Spirit, and yet praying with the Book is not consistent with praying with the Spirit, is unaccountable.</HI> If the Author publish any Answer to this Reply, <HI>I</HI> desire him to give a par∣ticular Answer to This, as well as divers other things of weight he hath past without all Notice.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="001109_0023_0FB0483CA573FF58"/>Pag. 21. He saith, <HI>It is not Our Opinion that all Forms are Unlawful;</HI> and that <HI>a late virulent anonimous Author has slander<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to be the Opinion of him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wrote a brief Discourse concerning the Unlawful∣ness of Common Prayer.</HI></P>

He now says, <HI>That it is not his Opinion that all Forms are Unlawful.</HI> But why then doth he set himself so much against all Liturgies, which contain nothing but Forms? If Forms be lawful, why may it not be thought that they might be used in the earliest Times of the Church? And if lawful in private, why not also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Publick?</P>
<P>Pag. 21. Whereas he saith, <HI>They</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Author and his Brethren) <HI>maintain, that there was no such Common-Prayer-Book of divine Institu∣tion, as our Author and some others have imagined.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>I Answer:</HI> Where did I ever maintain, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had a <HI>Common-Prayer-Book?</HI> I remember nothing of it, either in my Sermon or else where. They <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Jews)</HI> might have had some short Forms in the days of the Prophets, which they might have used without Book▪ But that they used the Book of the Psalms of <HI>Davi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in their Worship, I suppose the Author will not deny. And seeing that he has granted that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Forms are lawful, even of humane Composure, pro∣viding the Matter be Scriptural, and proper for the occasion, I see not how he can deny, but that <HI>All</HI> are lawful as well as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> if they have the like Qualifications. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d why they may not be writ or printed in a Book, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as <HI>David'</HI>s Psalms, he hath not told us.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This Argument is as weak as any of the former, and is far from concluding against <HI>Forms of prayer</HI> to be used in Publick; for he might as well argue▪ The Apostles would have made forms of <HI>Cate∣chisms, Confessions of Faith</HI> and <HI>Directories,</HI> which We find not that they did; and yet the <HI>Independents</HI> have their Confessions, Catechisms and Directory. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was no need for the Apostles making a <HI>Common∣Prayer</HI> for the Church after their days.

<P>P. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But says he. <HI>Supposing it to be a Duty to make use of Forms, which were of divine Inspiration, it does not at all follow, that it is then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duty to use Forms which are of Humane Composure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> This spoils all his former Confession, <HI>That he is not against all Forms;</HI> for he allows Men who have not the <HI>Gift of Prayer</HI> to use a Form in their Families, rather than not to pray at all; and I suppose that he will allow such Prayers to be, as to form and order of words, of <HI>Humane Composure.</HI> But of what Composure, <HI>I</HI> pray, are the Au∣thor'S, Prayers in the Church, and his Brethrens, are they not of <HI>Humane Composure</HI> as well as the Prayers in the <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church? if they are not, but wholly <HI>Divine,</HI> by the same aid and assistance of the Spirit as the Prophets and others had in extraordinary cases, they may be bound up in the Bible as parts of <HI>Canonical Scripture.</HI> Thus through his Inadvertency he falls again into the Spirit of <HI>Quakerism,</HI> who con∣tend that all their Preaching and Prayers are the immediate Dictates of the H.

<P><HI>I Ans.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this he hath over charged me, for I do not remember that there was any real Blasphemy in it▪ or a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Error oppugning directly any Fundamental of <HI>Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anity,</HI> though other Errors were in it, <HI>I</HI> confess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and too great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> especially in Opposing those Institutions of <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lords Sapper,</HI> which yet <HI>I</HI> did not will∣fully, but being deceived by false Teachers, to whom I too much trusted. But seeing I have found Mercy and Forgiveness of God con∣cerning those Errors and Uncharitable Speeches against Protestant Churches and Ministers, which I have freely Retracted, it doth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>(I</HI> think<HI>)</HI> savour so well of a Christian Spirit thus again and again to bring it up against me; should be not rather be like our heavenly Father to <HI>Forget,</HI> or not to remember our sins, as well as to <HI>Forgive</HI> them.</P>
<P>But the main Offence the Author seems to take against Forms of Prayer, is the <HI>Imposing them.</HI> For, saith he, <HI>Indeed we look upon the Im∣position of Forms as sinful, but not all Use o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them.</HI> What the Author means by the Church her <HI>Imposition,</HI> other than <HI>Enjoyning, I</HI> know not, and that only to her own Members, or any others especially, that would come into Communion with her, and most especially the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Church of England, or any others that on due Tryal of Qualifica∣tions, would offer themselves to officiate in the Ministry, as some have done, of such who had their Education among the Dissenters, and its to be hoped many others will in time follow the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Example. But do not the <HI>Independent Churches in New-England</HI> as much i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose on their Ministers and People their way of Worship, by what they call <HI>free con∣ceived Prayer.</HI> (called otherwise <HI>extempore Prayer?</HI>) Will they allow any of their Ministers to use those forms of Prayer, as contained in the Liturgy of the Church of England, (against which they can make no exception, as to the Matter) or the People to joyn with them, on sup∣position that some of their Ministers and People were most desirous to have their liberty to use them as thinking them more edifying, as well as more safe; for that they can the more safely joyn with them, and put a Seal of <HI>Amen</HI> to them (such as a Man's Seal that he puts to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond, which no prudent man would readily do at once hearing?) I think the Author will say <HI>Nay,</HI> to this weighty Question; and I leave it to im∣partial Men to consider, whether then the <HI>Independent Churches</HI> are not
<PB N="29" REF="001109_0028_0FB04840A241B2F8"/>
equally Imposers in <HI>One Way,</HI> as they judge us <HI>Another Way?</HI> And why what is lawful, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, may not be enjoyned by our spiritual Fathers, as well as they may be imposed on Children and Servants by their Natural Fathers &amp; Masters, I understand not. However, I think I have proved the <HI>Imposition</HI> (if it be proper so to call it) is equal on both sides.</P>
<P>If it be said, <HI>But the Parliament in King</HI> Charles <HI>the</HI> 2<HI>d's Reign, im∣posed a Fine of One Shilling on every one that would not come to Church on Sunday, according to a Statute made in Q.</HI> Elizabeths <HI>Reign.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> But since the Act of Tolleration, that Statute and the Use of it is expired; beside, it was not the <HI>Church</HI> but the <HI>Civil State</HI> that made it. But if <HI>I</HI> am rightly informed, the <HI>Independents</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> have (since they set up in <HI>N. England</HI>) imposed, <HI>i. e.</HI> enjoyned a greater Fine for them that come not to their Churches every Lords Day; so that still the <HI>Imposition</HI> is equal on both sides, or rather greater on their side. And what severe Laws the <HI>Independent Magistrates</HI> (who were eminent Members of their Churches, made against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> only as <HI>Quakers,</HI> and who did but distinguish themselves from others by their <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee</HI> to one, and <HI>Not Saluting with their Hats,</HI> the Author knows well enough. This the <HI>Quakers</HI> complained upon to be <HI>Imposition,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> think might justly so complain against the <HI>Independents</HI> as guilty of <HI>Imposition,</HI> &amp; such <HI>Severity</HI> as the <HI>Church of England</HI> never practised.</P>
<P>But whereas the Author saith, pag. 23. <HI>I affirm that there is not One Instance in all the Bible of Mens rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing their Prayers (still remembring that we distinguish between Psalms and Prayers) but there are very many Examples of free Prayer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> As many Prayers are not Psalms, so many Psalms are Prayers, and such as are Prayers (as the Book of <HI>Psalms</HI> abounds with such) ought, when used in Acts of Worship, to be used as Prayers; and if some of the People of <HI>Israel</HI> had them all by heart, yet its not likely that all had them so, but rather they used the Book to help their Memory in Prayer; and the Author can never show a right Reason why a Book may not be as lawfully used in Prayer as in Singing, seeing both are high Acts of Worship, and ought to be spiritually performed. Nor doth the <HI>Church of England</HI> think that bare reading a Prayer or Prayers, either in private or publick, is any acceptable Worship to God (and no more is <HI>extempore Prayer</HI>) but as it comes from the heart, with Sincerity and true Devotion &amp; Life. Many of most that use the Book in Preyer
<PB N="30" REF="001109_0029_0FB04841CFDE1E58"/>
have all the publick Prayers in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (most commonly used) by heart, and pray them from the heart, with sincerity and fervour, yet to use the Book so far us to have it lie open before them, to help their Memory, as they need it, I cannot see what sin is in this, suppose we had no Example of it in those most early Times of Primitive Antiquity when Printing was not known, and Writing was rare and very costly, so that every one could not have a <HI>Common▪ Prayer -Book.</HI></P>
<P>But whereas in my Sermon, p. 16. I shewed, <HI>That the</HI> Church of England <HI>has this advantage over all the</HI> Protestant Churches <HI>in</HI> Holland, France, Germany, <HI>&amp;c that the people pray vocally with the Minister, which</HI> (I said) <HI>cannot be well or safely done without set Forms.</HI> In Answer to this the Author saith, <HI>He</HI> (meaning G K.) <HI>cannot be ignorant that in Antiphones and Responses in publick Worship the</HI> Church of Rome <HI>out-does the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P><HI>To which I Answer:</HI> The Author of the Remarks, I think, cannot be ignorant that the common People have no part in those <HI>Antiphones</HI> and <HI>Responses,</HI> being all in <HI>Latine,</HI> which is an unknown Tongue to the generality of the people, and therefore he cannot be ignorant that his comparing the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> so as even to out-do her, is very Unfair, seeing all the Prayers in the <HI>Church of Eng∣land</HI> are in the <HI>English Tongue,</HI> and very intelligible to the generality of the People.</P>
<P>The Author charges me to be a <HI>little Mistaken about the Protest an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Churches in</HI> Germany, <HI>for some of them do,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> pray vocally with the Minister. <HI>Answ.</HI> If some of them do, of the more obscure sort, yet it is no great Mistake (if any to be Noticed) seeing even in Scripture stile, by the word <HI>All</HI> is signified the most part, of greatest Number of the <HI>Species,</HI> as where it is said, <HI>All</HI> Judea <HI>were baptized by</HI> John, and yet the Pharisees were not.</P>

Must there be no end of publick Repentances? This is more severe tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the severest Penances that the antient Church laid on Delinquents. If I had a mind to Recriminate I might, but I willingly forbear. If he thinks he has treated me some-what more civilly than the <HI>Quakers</HI> have done, in their scurrilous and lying Pamphlets, I thank him for it, (though I think in several Passages of his <HI>Remarks,</HI> he has been too severe and uncharitable towards me, and I have taken care hitherto, and intend so to do throughout my whole Reply, to treat him not only as civilly, but more civilly than he has treated me, so as to abstain from all Personal Refle∣ctions, and indeed from all other Reflections but what the Thread of his Discourse necessarily leads me unto, either by direct Argument, or by what we commonly call <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem,</HI> which he hath used against me, as I have against him: And whether He or <HI>I</HI> have the best cause, I leave to Intelligent and Impartial Readers.

But to say the Truth (ex∣cepting the Errors <HI>I</HI> had, both too many and too great, which yet did not destroy the Foundation that was laid in me) <HI>I</HI> was nearer in my Perswasions (even when a <HI>Quaker</HI>) to the <HI>Thirty Nine Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> than to any other called <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> or <HI>Com∣munions</HI> in <HI>Brittain,</HI> which made my coming to her Communion more easie to me, alter that God in his great Mercy had so far further en∣lightned me to see and renounce my former Errors, and <HI>I</HI> humbly thank my gracious God for the good Foundation of Faith that was laid in me under the Education I had, by the Grace of God (before I came among the <HI>Quakers</HI>) in my Native Country.
