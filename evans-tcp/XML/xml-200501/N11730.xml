<HEAD>THE DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To Lord BOSTON, Lord KIDNAPPER, and the in∣numerable and never-ending Clan of Macs and Donalds upon Donalds, and the Remnant of the Gentlemen Officers, Actors, Merry Andrews, strolling Players, Pirates and Buccaneers in America.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>UNDERSTANDING you are vastly fond of plays and farces, and frequently exhibit them for your own amusement, and the laudable purpose of ridiculing your masters (the</HI> Yankees, <HI>as you call 'em) it was ex∣pected you would have been polite enough to have favoured the world, or America at least, (at whose expence you act them) with some of your play-bills, or with a sample of your composition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall however not copy your churlishness, but dedicate the following Tragi-Comedy to your patronage, and for your future entertainment; and as the most of you have already acted your particular parts of it, both comic and tragic, in reality at Lexington, Bunker's-hill, the Great-Bridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to the very great applause of yourselves, tho' not of the whole house, no doubt you will preserve the marks, or memory of it, as long as you live, as it is wrote in capital American characters and letters of blood on your posteriors: And however some Whigs may censure you for your affected mirth (as they
<PB N="IV" REF="014823_0003_0F9738EAE9E5B158"/>
term it, in the deplorable situation you are now in, like bogs in a pen, and in want of elbow room) yet I can by no means agree with them, but think it a proof of true heroism and philosophy, to endeavour to make the best of a bad bargain, and laugh at yourselves, to prevent others from laughing at you; and tho' you are deprived of the use of your teeth, it is no reason you should be bereaved of the use of your tongues, your eyes, your ears, and your risible faculties and powers. That would be cruel indeed! after the glorious and fatiguing campaign you have made, and the many signal victories obtained over whole herbs of cattle and swine, routing flocks of sheep, lambs and geese, storming hen-roosts, and taking them prisoners, and thereby raising the glory of Old England to a pitch she never knew before. And ye Macs, and ye Donalds upon Donalds, go on, and may our gallows-bills and liberty poles be honour'd and adorn'd with some of your heads: Why should Tyburn and Temple-bar make a monopoly of so valuable a commodity?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wishing you abundance of entertainment in the re-acting this Tragi-Comedy, and of which I should be proud to take a part with you, tho' I have reason to think you would not of choice let me come within three hundred yards of your stage, lest I should rob you of your laurels, receive the clap of the whole house, and pass for a second Garrick among you, as you, know I always act with applause, speak bold—point blank—off hand—and without prompter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOLOMON said, "Oppression makes a wise man mad:" but what would he have said, had he lived in these days, and seen the oppression of the people of Boston, and the distressed situation of the inhabitants of Charlestown, Falmouth, Stonning∣ton, Bristol, Norfolk, &amp;c. Would he not have said, <Q>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread, but no man breaketh it un∣to them?</Q> <Q>They that did feed delicately, perish in the streets; they that were brought up in scar∣let, embrace the dung.</Q> What would he have said of rejected petitions, disregarded supplications, and contemned remonstrances? Would he not have said, "From hardness of heart, good Lord, deliver us?" What would he have said of a freeborn people butchered—their towns desolated, and become an heap of ashes—their inhabitants become beggars, wanderers and vagabonds—by the cruel orders of an unrelenting tyrant, wallowing in luxury, and wantonly wasting the people's wealth, to oppress them the more? Would he not have said, it was oppression and ingratitude in the highest degree, ex∣ceeding the oppression of the children of Israel? and, like Moses, have cried out, let the people go? Would he not have wondered at our patience and long-suffering, and have said, 'Tis time to change our master!—'Tis time to part!—And had he been an American born, would he not have shewed his wisdom by adopting the language of independency? Happy then for America in these fluctuating times, she is not without her Solomons, who see the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cessity of heark'ning to reason, and listening to the voice of COMMON SENSE.</P>

<P>'Tis I that move the mighty engine of royalty, and with the tincture of my somniferous opiate (or, in the language of a courtier) by the virtue of my secret in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence, I have lulled the axletree to sleep, and brought on a pleasing insensibility.</P>

<P>Oh! ambition, thou darling of my soul! stop not 'till I rise superior to all superlative, 'till I mount triumphantly the pinnacle of glory, or at least open the way for one of my own family and name to enter without opposition.</P>

<P>I see it plain! this, this alone is worth a ton of gold—Now, by St. Andrew! I'll strike a stroke that shall surprise all Europe, and make the boldest of the adverse party turn pale and tremble—Scotch politics, Scotch intrigues, Scotch Influence, and Scotch impudence (as they have termed it) they shall see ere long shine with unheard of spl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndour, and the name of Lord Paramount the mighty, shall blaze in the annals of the world with far greater lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tre (as a consummate politician) than the name of Alexander the Great, as an hero!</P>

<P>That day I much wish for,—but, with your Lordship's permission, I would just mention, that secrecy and dissimulation are the soul of enterprise; your Lordship hath many enemies, who watch ev'ry movement of state with a jealous and wary eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paramount.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, but the futile attempts of my timid adversaries have hitherto proved abortive—so far I have borne down all opposition, and those (even some of the greatest of them) who not long since were my most open, as well as secret enemies, I now behold with the most princely pleasure, the earliest to attend, to con∣gratulate me on my birth day, tho' uninvited, bow down, and make the most obsequious congees. Have you not seen this, Mocklaw? and how I keep them in expectation of something, by now and then bestowing part of a gracious smile amongst a do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en of 'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mocklaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, my Lord, and no doubt they inter∣pret that as a favourable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>men;—however, policy, my Lord, would dictate that to you, if there were no other consideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Param<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, and yet they are cursedly mistaken—and now, Mocklaw, as I have ever found you to be well dispos'd towards me, and the cause I espouse, and as I trust you continue satisfy'd with my former bounty, and my promise now of granting you a pension for life, with liberty to retire, I shall make you my confident, and disclose to you a secret no man except myself yet knows, which I expect you have so much honour to let it remain

a secret to all the world (I mean as to the main point I have in view).</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mocklaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, my Lord, I am sincerely devoted to your Lordship, command me, I care not what it is, I'll screw, twist and strain the law as tight as a drum-head to serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paramount.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall at this time but just give you a hint of the plan I've drawn up in my own mind. You must have perceived in me a secret hankering for majesty for some time past, notwithstanding my age;—but as I have considered the great dislike the nation in general have, as to my person. I'll wave my own pretensions, and bend my power and affiduity to it in favour of one, the nearest a kin to me, you know who I mean, and a particular friend of yours, provided I continue to be dictator, as at present; and further, I intend America shall submit.—What think you of it so far?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mocklaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>A day I've long wish'd to see! but you stagger me, my Lord, not as to my honour, secrecy, or resolution to serve you, but as to the accomplishment of such grand designs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paramount.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, I have undertaken a mighty task, a task that would have perplexed the Council of Nice, and stagger'd even Julius Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mocklaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have need, my Lord, of all your wis∣dom, fortitude and power, when you consider with whom you have to contend.—Let me see—Lord Wisdom—Lord Religion—L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Justice—Lord Patri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t—the bold Irish∣man, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and the wisdom of the United Colonies of America, in Congress to cope with; as individuals they are trifling, but in league combined may become potent enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paramount.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted—But are you so little of a law∣yer as not to know the virtue of a certain specific I'm possess'd of, that will accomplish any thing, even to performing miracles? Don't you know there's such sweet music in the shaking of the treasury keys, that they will instantly lock the most babbling patriot's tongue! trans∣form a Tory into a Whig, and a Whig into a Tory? make a superannuated old miser dance, and an old Cy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> philo∣sopher smile? How many thousand times has your tongue

danc'd at Westminster Hall to the sound of such music?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mocklaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enchanting sounds, powerful magic, there's notwithstanding the charms of such music, their potency and influence are irresistible—that is a point of law I can by no means give up, of more force than all the acts of parliament since the days of king Alfred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'm glad you acknowledge that—Now then for a line of politics—I propose to begin first by tax∣ing America, as a blind—that will create an eternal ani∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity between us, and by sending over continually ships and troops, this will of course produce a civil war—weaken Britain by leaving her coasts defenceless, and im∣pover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h America; so that we need not fear any thing from that quarter. Then the united fleets of France and Spain with troops to appear in the channel, and make a descent, while my kinsman with thirty thousand men lands in Scotland, marches to London, and joins the others: What then can prevent the scheme from having the wish'd for effect? This is the main point, which keep to yourself.</P>

<P>If it has failed heretofore, 'tis impossible it should fail now; nothing within the reach of human wis∣dom was ever planned so judiciously; had Solomon been alive, and a politician, I would have sworn your Lordship had consulted him.—But I would beg leave to hint to your Lordship the opposition to be apprehended from the militia of England; and the German forces that may be sent for according to treaty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paramount.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the militia, they are half of them my friends, witness Lancaster, Manchester, Liver∣pool, &amp;c, &amp;c. &amp;c. the other half scarce ever fired a gun in their lives, especially those of London, and I shall take care by shaking the keys a little to have such officers ap∣pointed over them, who are well known to be in my in∣terest. As to the German forces, I have nothing to ap∣prehend from them; the parliament can soon pass an act against the introduction of foreign troops, exept the French or Spaniards, who can't be called foreign, they are our friends and nearest neighbours. Have you any thing further to object against the probability of this plan?</P>

<P>You are very right, I have 'em fast enough—Mammon will work powerfully on them—The keys—the keys—His Grace my Lord of Suffolk, and Dean Tucker, are managing this business for me, and feeding them with the hopes of being all created Arch-bishops here, and each to have a diocese, and Bishops of their own appointment in America; not a city or town there but must be provided with a Bishop: There let religion erect her holy altars, by which means their revenues will be augmented beyond that of a Cardinal.

<P>My Lords and Gentlemen, it seems oppo∣sition to our measures are making hasty-strides; the discon∣tented faction, the supporters and encouragers of rebellion, and whose hearts are tainted therewith, seem bent, if pos∣sible, on the destruction of Britain, and their own aggrandise∣ment. Are not the daily papers filled with treasonable re∣solves of American congresses and committees, extracts of letters, and other infamous pieces and scurrilous pamph∣lets, circulating with unusual industry throughout the kingdom, by the enemies of Britain, thereby poisoning the minds of our liege subjects with their detestable te∣nets?—And did you not this day see the procession, and that vile miscreant Lord Patriot at their head, going to St. James's with their remonstrance, in such state and pa∣rade as manifestly tended to provoke, challenge and defy majesty itself, and the powers of government? and yet nothing done to stop their pernicious effects.—Surely, my Lords and Gentlemen, you must agree with me, that it is now become highly expedient that an immediate stop should be put to such unwarrantable and dangerous pro∣ceedings, by the most vigorous and coercive measures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mocklaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I entirely agree with your Lordship, and was ever firmly of opinion, that licentiousness of every kind, (particularly that of the Press) is dangerous to the state; the rabble should be kept in awe by examples of severity, and a proper respect should be enforced to supe∣riors. I have sufficiently shewn my dislike to the freedom of the press, by the examples I have frequently made (tho' too favourable) of several printers, and others, who had greatly trespassed, and if they still persist, other measures should be taken with them, which the laws will point out; and as to Lord Patriot, he's a fellow that has been out∣law'd, scandal proof, little to be got by meddling with him; I would advise to let him alone for the present, and humble America first.</P>

<P>I am very clear in it, please your Lord∣ship;
<PB N="12" REF="014823_0019_0F973A2412D810F0"/>
there are numbers of men in this country who are ever studying how to perplex and entangle the state, con∣stantly thwarting government, in ev'ry laudable under∣taking; this clamorous faction must be curbed, must be sub∣dued and crush'd—our thunder must go forth, America must be conquered. I am for blood and fire to crush the rising glories of America—They boast of her strength; she must be conquered, it half Germany is called to our assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Poltron.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I entirely agree with you, Mr. Brazen; my advice is, that Lord Boston and Admiral Tombstone be immediately despatch'd to Boston, with two or three regiments (tho' one would be more than sufficient) and a few ships to shut up their ports, disannul their charter, stop their trade, and the pusillanimous beggars, those scoundrel rascals, whose predominant passions are impudence and fear, would immediately give up, on the first landing of the regulars, and fly before 'em like a hare before the hounds; that this would be the case, I pawn my honour to your Lordships, nay I'll sacrifice my life: My Lords, I have more∣over the testimony of General Amherst and Colonel Grant to back my assertion; besides here's Mr. Judas, let him speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Hypocrite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If this is the same Colonel Grant that was at Fort Duque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, the same that ran away from the French and Indians, the same that ran away from the French and Indians, the same that was rescued by Colonel Washington, I have no idea of his honour or testimony.</P>

<P>You might as well have said courage too; I have exceptions against both; and as to General Amher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's assertion that he could drive all America with five thousand men, he must have been joking, as he is quite of a diff'rent opinion now.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Catspaw.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>These sour Americans, ignorant brutes, unbroke and wild, must be tamed; they'll soon be humble if punish'd; but if disregarded, grow fierce.—Barbarous na∣tions must be held by fear, rein'd and spurr'd hard, chain'd to the oar, and bow'd to due controul, 'till they look grim with blood; let's first humble America, and bring them under our feet; the olive-branch has been held out, and they have rejected it; it now becomes us to use the iron rod to break their disobedience; and should we lack it, foreign assistance is at hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Hypocrite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All this I grant, but I'm for sending a force sufficient to crush 'em at once, and not with too much precipitation; I am first for giving it a colour of impartiality, forbearance and religion.—Lay it before par∣liament; we have then law on our side, and endeavour to gain over some or all of the Methodist Teachers, and in particular my very good friend Mr. Wesley, their Bishop, and the worthy Mr. Clapum, which task I would under∣take; it will then have the sanction of religion, make it less suspected, and give it a better grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Catspaw.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I should choose it to be done by consent of parliament; we stand then on firmer ground; there's no doubt they'll grant ev'ry thing your Lordship proposes upon my motion: but to tell the truth, I'd rather be in purgatory so long, than to run the gantlet of the Bold Irishman's tongue.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Justice.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gratitude, like religion and patriotism, are about taking their flight, and the law of the land stands on tiptoe; the constitution, that admirable fabric, that work of ages, the envy of the world, is deflower'd indeed, and made to commit a rape upon her own body, by the avaricious frowns of her own father, who is bound to protect her, not to destroy—Her pillars are thrown down, her capitals broke, her pedestals demolish'd and her foun∣dation nearly destroy'd.—Lord Paramount and his wretched adviser Mocklaw baffles all our efforts.—The statutes of the land superseded by royal proclamations and dispensing powers, &amp;c. &amp;c. the bloody knife to be held to the throats of the Americans, and force them to submit to slav'ry.—Administration have commenced bloody tyrants, and those that should protect the subject, are become their execu∣tioners; yet will I dispute with them inch by inch, while there's a statute book left in the land.

<P>Our friends must bestir themselves once more, perhaps we may yet turn the scale.—If the voice of religion, wisdom and justice should fail, let us sound the trumpet of liberty and patriotism, that will conquer them in America, I know; let us try to storm them here with the united whole, and if by a base majority they still carry their point, we can nevertheless wash our hands and be clean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Religion.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From the pulpit, in the house of God, have I spoken aloud, I have lifted up my voice like a trum∣pet, Oh! Britain, how art thou fallen! Hear now, O house of Britain, is it a small thing for you to weary man, but will you weary your God also? In the house of Lords have I borne my testimony: Hear now, O ye Princes, and I will yet declare in Britain, and shew forth in America, I will not cease 'till I bring about (if possible) unity, peace and concord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Wisdom.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Much to be wished for; but alas! I fear it's now too late; I foresee the tendency and consequence of those diabolical measures that have been pursued with unrelenting fury. Britain will ruin her trade, waste her wealth, her strength, her credit and her importance in the
<PB N="17" REF="014823_0024_0F973A2B8E1043F8"/>
scale of Europe. When a British king proves ungrateful and haughty, and strives to be independent of his people, (who are his sole support) the people will in their turn likewise strive to be independent of him and his myrmidons, and will be free; they will erect the anfractuous standard of independency, and thousands and tens of thousands will flock to it, and solace themselves under its shade.—They have often been told of this, but affected to despise it; they know not America's strength, they are ignorant of it; fed by the flatt'ry of every sycophant tale, imagine themselves almighty, and able to subdue the whole world. America will be lost to Britain for ever, and will prove her downfall. America is wise, and will shake off the galling yoke before it be rivetted on them; they will be drove to it, and who can blame them? Who can blame a gally slave for making his escape?—Britain will miscarry in her vile projects, her knight errant, her Don Quixotte schemes in America: America will resist; they are not easily to be subdued; (nay 'tis impossible) Britain will find it a harder task than to con∣quer France and Spain united, and will cost 'em more blood and treasure than a twice seven years war with those European powers; they will stand out 'till Britons are tired. Britain will invite her with kind promises and open arms; America will reject them; America will triumph, rejoice and flourish, and become the glory of the earth; Britain will languidly hold down her head, and become first a prey to a vile Pre∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder, and then be subject to the ravagers of Europe. I love the Americans, because they love liberty. Liberty flourishes in the wilds of America. I honour the plant, I revere the tree, and would cherish its branches. Let us, my friends, join hands with them, follow their example, and endeavour to support expiring liberty in Britain; whilst I have a tongue to speak, I will support her wherever found; whilst I have crutches to crawl with, I will try to find her out, and with the voice of an arch-angel will demand for a sacrifice to the nation those miscreants who have wickedly and wantonly been the ruin of their country. Oh, Liberty! Oh, my country!</P>

<P>And thus they'll drive liberty from out the land, yet I hope they'll meet the ambitious Phaeton's fate; but when a brave people, like the Americans, from their infancy us'd to liberty (not as a gift, but who in∣herit it as a birth-right, but not as a mess of pottage, to be bought by, or sold to, ev'ry hungry glutton of a minister) find attempts made to reduce them to slavery, they generally take some desperate successful measure for their deliverance. I should not be at all surpris'd to hear of independency pro∣claim'd throughout their land, of Britain's armies beat, their fleets burnt, sunk, or otherwise destroy'd. The same principle which Mr. Brazen speaks of, that inspires British soldiers to fight, namely the ferment of youthful blood, the high spirit of the people, a love of glory, and a sense of national honour, will inspire the Americans to withstand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m; to which I may add, liberty and property.—But what is national honour?

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Roger and Dick, two shepherds near LEXINGTON, after the defeat and flight of the Regulars.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whilst early looking, Dick, ere the sun was seen to tinge the brow of the mountain, for my flock of sheep, nor dreaming of approaching evil, suddenly mine eyes beheld from you hill a cloud of dust arise at a small distance; the intermediate space were thick set with laurels, willows, ever∣greens, and bushes of various kinds, the growth of wild nature, and which hid the danger from my eyes, thinking perchance my flock had thither stray'd; I descended, and straight onward went; but, Dick, judge you my thoughts at such a disappointment: Instead of my innocent flock of sheep, I found myself almost encircled by a herd of ravenous British wolves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dangerous must have been your situation, Ro∣ger, whatever were your thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>I soon discovered my mistake; finding a hostile appearance, I instantly turn'd myself about, and fled to alarm the shepherds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did they pursue you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did; but having the start, and being ac∣quainted with the bye-ways, I presently got clear of their voracious jaws.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lucky escape, indeed, Roger; and what rout did they take after that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Onwards, t'wards Lexington, devouring geese, cattle and swine, with fury and rage, which, no doubt, was increased by their disappointment; and what may appear strange to you, Dick, (tho' no more strange than true) is, they seem'd to be possessed of a kind of brutish music, growling something like our favourite tune Yankee Doodle, (perhaps in ridicule) 'till it were almost thread bare, seem∣ing vastly pleased (monkey-like) with their mimickry, as tho' it provoked us much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature, Roger, has furnish'd some brute animals with voices, or, more properly speaking, with organs of sound that nearly resemble the human. I have heard of crocodiles weeping like a child, to decoy the unwary
<PB N="32" REF="014823_0039_0F973AE52F014F58"/>
traveller, who is no sooner within their reach, but they seize and devour instantly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Dick, I have read of the same; and these wolves, being of the canine breed, and having the properties of blood-hounds, no doubt are possess'd of a more acute sense of smelling, more reason, instinct, sa∣gacity, or what shall I call it? than all other brutes. It might have been a piece of cunning of theirs, peculiar to them, to make themselves pass for shepherds, and decoy our flocks; for, as you know, Dick, all our shepherds both play and sing Yankee Doodle, our sheep and lambs are as well acquainted with that tune as ourselves, and always make up to us whene'er they hear the sound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Roger; and now you put me in mind of it I'll tell you of something surprising in my turn: I have an old ram and an old ewe, that, whenever they sing Yankee Doodle together, a skilful musician can scarcely distinguish it from the bass and tenor of an organ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprising indeed, Dick, nor do I in the least doubt it; and why not, as well as Balaam's ass, speak? and I might add, many other asses, now-a-days; and yet, how might that music be improved by a judicious disposition of its various parts, by the addition of a proper number of sheep and young lambs; 'twould then likewise resemble the counter, counter tenor, treble, and finest pipes of an organ, and might be truly called nature's organ; methinks, Dick, I could forever sit and hear such music,</P>
<L><HI>Where all the parts in complication roll,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with its charming music feast the soul!</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delightful, indeed; I'll attempt it with what little skill I have in music; we may then defy these wolves to imitate it, and thereby save our flocks: I am well con∣vinced, Roger, these wolves intended it rather as a decoy than by way of ridicule, because they live by cunning and deception; besides, they could never mean to ridicule a piece of music, a tune, of which such brutes cannot be supposed to be judges, and, which is allowed by the best masters of music to be a composition of the most sublime kind, and would have done honour to a Handel or a Cor∣rellius. Well, go on, Roger, I long to hear the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="014823_0040_0F973AE689A83AA0"/>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>When they came to Lexington, where a flock of our innocent sheep and young lambs, as usual, were feeding and sporting on the plain, these dogs of violence and rapine with haughty stride advanc'd, and berated them in a new and unheard of language to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose learn'd at their own fam'd universities—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt; they had teachers among them—Two old wolves their leaders, not unlike in features to Smith and Pitcairn, as striving to outvie each other in the very dregs of brutal eloquence, and more than Billings∣gate jargon, howl'd in their ears such a peal of new-fangled execra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, and hell-invented oratory, 'till that day unheard in New-England, as struck the whole flock with horror, and made them for a while stand aghast, as tho' all the wolves in the forest had broke loose upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh shocking!—Roger, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not content with this, their murdering leaders, with premeditated malice, keen appetite, and without provo∣cation, gave the howl for the onset, when instantly the whole herd, as if the devil had entered into them, ran violently down the hill, and fixed their talons and jaws upon them, and as quick as lightening eight innocent young lambs fell a sacrifice to their fury, and victims to their rapacity; the very houses of our God were no longer a sanctuary; many they tore to pieces, and some at the very foot of the altar; others were dragged out as in a wanton gamesome mood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Barbarity inexpressible! more than savage cruelty! I hope you'll make their master pay for 'em; there is a law of this province, Roger, which obliges the owner of such dogs to pay for the mischief they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, Dick; he shall pay, never fear, and that handsomely too; he has paid part of it already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is their master, Roger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>One Lord Paramount; they call him a free∣booter; a fellow who pretends to be proprietor of all Ame∣rica, and says he has a deed for it, and chief ranger of all the flocks, and pretends to have a patent for it; has been a long time in the practice of killing and stealing sheep in England and Ireland, and had like to have been hang'd
<PB N="34" REF="014823_0041_0F973AE6EBA7D3B8"/>
for it there, but was reprieved by the means of his friend GEORGE—I forgot his other name—not Grenville—not George the Second—but another George—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter, he'll be hang'd yet; he has sent his dogs to a wrong place, and lugg'd the wrong sow by the ear; he should have sent them to Newfoundland, or Kamptschatka, there's no sheep there—But never mind, go on, Roger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor was their voracious appetites satiated there; they rush'd into the town of Concord, and proceeded to devour every thing that lay in their way; and those brute devils, like Sampson's foxes, (and as tho' they were men) thrice attempted with firebrands to destroy our corn, our town-house and habitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! Could not all this provoke you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did; rage prompted us at length, and found us arms against such hellish mischief to oppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, would I had been there!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our numbers increasing, and arm'd with re∣venge, we in our turn play'd the man; they, unus'd to wounds, with hideous yelling soon betook themselves to a precipitate and confused flight, nor did we give o'er the chase, 'till Phoebus grew drowsy, bad us desist, and wished us a good night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of some part of their hasty retreat I was a joy∣ful spectator, I saw their tongues lolling out of their mouths, and heard them pant like hunted wolves indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not hear how their mirth was turn'd into mourning? their fury into astonishment? how soon they quitted their howling Yankee Doodle, and chang'd their notes to bellowing? how nimbly (yet against their will) they betook themselves to dancing? And he was then the bravest dog that beat time the swiftest, and footed Yankee Doodle the nimblest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well pleased, Roger, was I with the chace, and glorious sport it was: I oft perceiv'd them tumbling o'er each other heels over head; nor did one dare stay to help his brother—but, with bloody breech, made the best of his way—nor ever stopped 'till they were got safe within their lurking-holes—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whence they have not the courage to peep out, unless four to one, except (like a skunk) forc'd by famine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>May this be the fate of all those prowling sheep∣stealers; it behooves the shepherds to double the watch, to take uncommon precaution and care of their tender flocks, more especially as this is like to be an uncommon severe winter, by the appearance of wolves so early in the season—but, hark!—Roger, methinks I hear the sound of melody warbling thro' the grove—Let's sit a while, and partake of it unseen.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I fully expected, with the help of the last reinforcement you brought me over, and the advice and as∣sistance of three accomplish'd and experienc'd Generals, I should have been able to have subdued the rebels, and gain'd immortal laurels to myself—have return'd to Old England like a Roman Consul, with a score or two of the rebel Ge∣nerals, Colonels and Majors, to have grac'd my triumph.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elbow Room.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been vastly disappointed, Sir—you must not look for laurels (unless wild ones) nor expect triumphs (unless sham ones) from your own victories or conquests in America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And yet not more disappointed than you, Sir—witness your thrasonical speeches on your first land∣ing, provided you had but elbow room—and Mr. Caper too to bring over Monsieur Rigadoon, the dancing-master, and Signior Rosin, the fiddler for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooth; he thought, no doubt, to have country danc'd the rebels out of their liberty with some of his new cuts—with his soft music to have fascinated their wives and daughters, and with some of 'em, no doubt, to have taken the tour of America, with his reg'ment of fine sleek prancing horses, that have been feeding this six months on codfish tails; he thought to have grown fat with feasting, dancing, and drinking tea with the Ladies, instead of being the skeleton he now appears to be—not to mention any thing of his letter, wherein he laments Tom's absence; for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Burgoyne'</HI>s <HI>letter.</HI></NOTE> "had Tom been with him (he says) he wou'd have been out of danger, and quite secure from the enemy's shot."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Gentlemen, we're even with you now; you have had your mirth and frolick with us, for dancing Yankee Doodle, as you called it, from Lexington.—I find you have had a severer dance, a brave sweat at Bunker's Hill, and have been obliged to pay the fiddler in the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>However, Gentlemen, I approve (at proper sea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons)
<PB N="52" REF="014823_0059_0F973AF8D75EE518"/>
of a little joking, yet I can by no means think (as we have had such bad success with our crackers) that this is a proper time to throw your squibs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you, Sir, this is a very improper time for joking; for my part, I was only speaking as to my own thoughts, when Mr. Elbow Room made remarks, which he might as well have spared.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elbow Room.</SPEAKER>
<P>I took you, Sir, as meaning a reflection up∣on us for our late great loss, and particularly to myself, for expressing some surprise on our first landing, that you should suffer a parcel of ignorant peasants to drive you before 'em like sheep from Lexington; and I must own I was a little chagrin'd at your seeming so unconc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn'd at such an affair as this, (which had nearly prov'd our ruin) by your innu∣endoes and ironical talk of accomplish'd Generals, Roman Consuls and triumphs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My mentioning accomplish'd Generals, surely, Sir, was rather a compliment to you.</P>
</SP>

<P>When irony pass current for compli∣ments, and we take it so, I shall have no objection to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Caper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The affair of Lexington, My Lord Boston, at which you were so much affrighted (if I am rightly in∣form'd) was because you then stood on your own bottom, this of Bunker's Hill you seem secretly to rejoice at, only because you have three accomplish'd and experienc'd Ge∣nerals to share the disgrace with you, besides the brave Ad∣miral Tombstone—you talk of dancing and fiddling, and yet you do neither, as I see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, what did you do with the commission, the post, the Duke of Grafton gave you, in lieu of your losses at Preston election, and the expences of your trial at the king's bench for a riot, which had emptied your pockets?—Why you sold it—you sold it, Sir—to raise cash to gamble with.—</P>

<P>Pray, Gentlemen, drop this discourse, consider

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our late great loss of men has tore up the foundation of our plan, and render'd all further attempts impracticable—'twill be a long time ere we can expect any more reinforcements—and if they should arrive, I'm doubt∣ful of their success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clinton.</SPEAKER>
<P>The provincials are vastly strong, and seem no novices in the art of war; 'tis true we gain'd the hill at last, but of what advantage is it to us?—none—the loss of 1400 as brave men as Britain can boast of, is a melancholy consideration, and must make our most sanguinary friends in England abate of their vigour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elbow Room.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw or read of any battle equal to it—never was more martial courage display'd, and the pro∣vincials, to do the dogs justice, sought like heroes, fought indeed more like devils than men; such carnage and de∣struction not exceeded by Blenheim, Minden, Fontenoy, Ramillies, Dettingen, the battle of the Boyne, and the late affair of the Spaniards and Algerines—a mere cock-fight to it—no laurels there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Caper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor triumphs neither—I regret in par∣ticular the number of brave Officers that fell that day, many of whom were of the first families in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Admiral <HI>Tombstone.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>I'll despatch an express to the Con∣gress. This repulse, if I mistake not, (or victory, as Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le∣ton may call it) will stand 'em but in little stead—'t will be

<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Lee.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I lament the loss of the valiant Montgomery and his brave officers and soldiers (at this time more espe∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y) 'tis the fortune of war, 'tis unavoidable; yet, I doubt not, out of their ashes will arise new heroes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Putnam.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who can die a more glorious, a more honourable death than in their country's cause?—let it re∣double our ardour, and kindle a noble emulation in our breasts—let each American be determined to conquer or die in a righteous cause.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Lee.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Peace is despaired of, and who can think of submission? The last petition from the Congress, like the former, has been disregarded; they prayed but for liberty, peace and safety, and their omnipotent authoritative supreme-ships will grant them neither: War, then, war open and understood, must be resolved on; this, this will humble their pride, will bring their tyrant noses to the ground, each 'em humility, and force them to hearken to reason when 'tis too late. My noble General, I join you <HI>[drawing his sword]</HI> I'll away with the scabbard, and sheathe my sword in the bosom of tyranny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Putnam.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not read the speed, where frowning revenge and sounds of awful dread for disgrace at Lexington and loss at Bunker's-hill echo forth? Not smiling peace, or pity, tame his sullen soul; but, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aroah-like, on the wings of tyranny he rides and forfeits happi∣ness to feast revenge, 'till the waters of the red sea of blood deluge the tyrant, with his mixed host of vile cut-throats, murderers, and bloody butchers.</P>
