<P>THE council of England was divided in opinion about the measures to be taken with the queen of Scots. Some members proposed, that as her health was very infirm, her life might be shortened by close confinement▪ therefore, to avoid any imputation of violence or cruelty, the earl of Leicester proposed that she should be dispatched by poison; but the ma∣jority insisted on her being put to death by legal process.

<P>THIRTY-SIX of these commissioners arriving at the castle of Fotheringay, presented her with a letter from Elizabeth, com∣manding her to submit to trial for her late conspiracy. Mary perused the letter with great composure; and as she had long foreseen the danger that hung over her, received the intelligence without emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that she wondered the queen of England should command her as a sub∣ject, who was an independent sovereign, and a queen like her∣self. She would never, she said, stoop to any condescension which would lessen her dignity, or prejudice the claims of her posterity. The laws of England, she observed, were unknown to her; she was destitute of counsel; nor could she conceive who were to be her peers, as she had but one equal in the king∣dom.

When the commissioners pressed her to submit to the queen's pleasure, otherwise they would proceed against her as contuma∣cious, she declared she would rather suffer a thousand deaths, than own herself a subject to any prince on earth. That however she was rea∣dy to vindicate herself in a full and free parliament, as for aught she knew, this meeting of commissioners was devised against her life, on purpose to take it away with a pretext of justice. She exhorted them to consult their own consciences, and to remember that the theatre of the world was much more extensive than that of the kingdom of England. At length the vice-chamberlain Hatton vanquished her objec∣tions, by representing that she injured her reputation by avoiding a trial, in which her innocence might be proved to the satisfaction of all mankind. This observation made such an impression upon her, that she agreed to plead, if they would admit and allow her protest, of disallowing all subjection. This, however, they refused; but they satis∣fied her, by entering it upon record, and thus they proceeded to trial.</P>

Your infer∣ences are too gloomy: various opportunities will offer, doubt not, to speed our generous intercourse. The wide world of sentiment and sensation still opens upon us. By aid of this little friendly in∣strument, we may range through those paths which Ocean seems to separate. However remote, you should still learn to think it a superiour blessing, that in some part of animated Nature, there still ex∣ists the counter part of Emma—congenial, as dear; one, whom no circumstance can change, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho must ever remain true to every touch of joy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-</P>
