<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN</HI> offering the following pages to the public, I feel myself necessitated to apologize for the errors which I am fearful will be evident to the severe eye of criticism.</P>
<P>The thought of writing a Dramatic Piece was hastily conceived, and as hastily executed; it being not more than two months, from the first starting of the idea, to the time of its being performed.</P>
<P>I feel myself extremely happy, in having an opportunity, thus publicly to acknowledge my ob∣ligation to Mr. Reinagle, for the attention he manifested, and the taste and genius he dis∣played in the composition of the music. I must also return my thanks to the Perfor∣mers, who so readily accepted, and so ably supported their several characters: Since it was chiefly owing to their exertions, that the Play was received with such unbounded marks of appro∣bation.</P>
<P>Since the first performance, I have made some alterations; and flatter myself those alterations have improved it: But of that, as well as of its merits in general, I am content to abide the decision of a candid and indulgent Public.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="027655_0005_0FD56971B0167490"/>Some part of the plot is taken from the Story of the Captive, related by Cervantes, in his in∣imitable Romance of Don Quixote, the rest is entirely the offspring of fancy.</P>
<P>I am fully sensible of the many disadvantges under which I consequently labour from a con∣fined education; nor do I expect my style will be thought equal in elegance or energy, to the productions of those who, fortunately, from their sex, or situation in life, have been instructed in the Classics, and have reaped both pleasure and improvement by studying the Ancients in their original purity.</P>
<P>My chief aim has been, to offer to the Public a Dramatic Entertainment, which, while it might excite a smile, or call forth the tear of sensibi∣lity, might contain no one sentiment, in the least prejudicial, to the moral or political principles of the government under which I live. On the contrary, it has been my endeavour, to place the social virtues in the fairest point of view, and hold up, to merited contempt and ridicule, their opposite vices. If, in this attempt, I have been the least successful, I shall reap the reward to which I aspire, in the smiles and approbation of a Liberal Public.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, To the New Comedy of SLAVES IN ALGIERS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written and Spoken by Mr. FENNELL.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN aged Priam, to Achilles' tent</L>
<L>To beg the captive corse of Hector went,</L>
<L>The silent suppliant spoke the father's fears,</L>
<L>His sighs his eloquence—his prayers his tears.</L>
<L>The noble conqueror by the sight was won,</L>
<L>And to the weeping sire restor'd the son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No great Achilles holds <HI>your</HI> sons in chains,</L>
<L>No heart alive to friends' or father's pains,</L>
<L>No generous conqueror who is proud to shew,</L>
<L>That valour vanquish'd is no more his foe;—</L>
<L>But one, whose idol, is his pilfer'd gold,</L>
<L>Got, or by piracy, or subjects sold.</L>
<L><HI>Him</HI> no fond father's prayers nor tears can melt,</L>
<L>Untaught to feel for, what he never felt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What then behoves it, they who help'd to gain,</L>
<L>A nation's freedom, feel the galling chain?</L>
<L>They, who a more than ten year's war withstood,</L>
<L>And stamp'd their country's honour with their blood?</L>
<L>Or, shall the noble Eagle see her brood,</L>
<L>Beneath the pirate kite's fell claw subdu'd?</L>
<L>View her dear sons of liberty enslaved,</L>
<L>Nor let them share the blessings which they sav'd?</L>
<L>—It must not be—each heart, each soul must rise,</L>
<L>Each ear must listen to their distant cries;</L>
<L>Each hand must give, and the quick sail unfurl'd,</L>
<L>Must bear their ransom to the distant world.</L>
<L><PB REF="027655_0007_0FD56976472D43D8"/>Nor <HI>here</HI> alone, Columbia's sons be free,</L>
<L><HI>Where'er</HI> they breath there must be liberty.</L>
<L>—There <HI>must!</HI> there <HI>is,</HI> for he who form'd the whole,</L>
<L>Entwin'd blest freedom with th' immortal <HI>soul.</HI></L>
<L>Eternal twins, whose mutual efforts fan,</L>
<L>That heavenly flame that gilds the life of man,</L>
<L>Whose light, 'midst manacles and dungeons drear,</L>
<L>The sons of honour, must forever cheer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tyrant then the virtuous heart can bind?</L>
<L>'Tis vices only can enslave the mind.</L>
<L>Who barters country, honour, faith, to save</L>
<L>His life, tho' free in person, is a slave.</L>
<L>While he, enchain'd, imprison'd tho' he be,</L>
<L>Who lifts his arm for liberty, is free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To-night, our author boldly dares to chuse,</L>
<L>This glorious subject for her humble muse;</L>
<L>Tho' tyrants check the genius which they fear,</L>
<L>She dreads no check, nor persecution <HI>here</HI>;</L>
<L>Where safe asylums every virtue guard,</L>
<L>And every talent meets its just reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some say—the Comic muse, with watchful eye,</L>
<L>Should catch the reigning <HI>vices</HI> as they fly,</L>
<L>Our author boldly has revers'd that plan,</L>
<L>The reigning <HI>virtues</HI> she has dar'd to scan,</L>
<L>And tho' a woman, plead the Rights of Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus she, with anxious hope her fate abides,</L>
<L>And to your care, the tender plant confides,</L>
<L>Convinc'd you'll cherish, what to freedom's true;</L>
<L>She trusts its life, to candour and to you.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, it's all vastly pretty, the gardens, the house and these fine cloaths, I like them ve∣ry well, but I don't like to be confined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, surely, you have no reason to complain; chosen favourite of the Dey, what can you wish for more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, a great many things—In the first place, I wish for liberty. Why do you talk of my being a favou∣rite; is the poor bird that is confined in a cage (be∣cause a favourite with its enslaver) consoled for the loss of freedom. No! tho' its prison is of golden wire, its food delicious, and it is overwhelm'd with caresses, its little heart still pants for liberty: gladly
<PB N="6" REF="027655_0010_0FD569798BA260D8"/>
would it seek the fields of air, and even perched up∣on a naked bough, exulting, carrol forth its song, nor once regret the splendid house of bondage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! but then our master loves you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of that, I don't love him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not love him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—he is old and ugly, then he wears such tre∣menduous whiskers; and when he makes love, he looks so grave and stately, that I declare, if it was not for fear of his huge scymetar, I shou'd burst out a laugh∣ing in his face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care you don't provoke him too far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care how I provoke him, if I can but make him keep his distance. You know I was brought here only a few days since—well, yesterday, as I was amusing myself, looking at the fine things I saw every where about me, who should bolt into the room, but that great, ugly thing Mustapha. What do you want, said I?—Most beautiful Fetnah, said he, bowing till the tip of his long, hooked nose almost ouched the toe of his slipper—most beautiful Fetnah, our power∣ful and gracious master, Muley Moloc, sends me, the humblest of his slaves, to tell you, he will condescend to sup in your apartment to night, and commands you to receive the high honour with proper humility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="027655_0011_0FD5697ECA092B08"/>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—and what answer did you return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, I was so frightened, and so provoked, I hard∣ly know what I said, but finding the horrid looking creature didn't move, at last I told him, that if the Dey was determined to come, I supposed he must, for I could not hinder him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—but he made me go to him, and when I went trembling into the room, he twisted his whiskers and knit his great beetle brows. Fetnah said, he you abuse my goodness, I have condescended to request you to love me. And then he gave me such a fierce look, as if he would say, and if you don't love me, I'll cut your head off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say you were finely frightened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frightened! I was provoked beyond all patience, and thinking he would certainly kill me one day or other, I thought I might as well speak my mind, and be dispatched out of the way at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me tremble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, mustering up as much courage as I could; great and powerful Muley, said I—I am sensible I am your
<PB N="8" REF="027655_0012_0FD56980658E5970"/>
slave; you took me from an humble state, placed me in this fine palace, and gave me these rich cloaths; you bought my person of my parents, who loved gold bet∣ter than they did their child; but my affections you could not buy. I can't love you.—How! cried he, starting from his seat: how, can't love me?—and he laid his hand upon his scymetar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear! Fetnah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I saw the scymetar half drawn, I caught hold of his arm.—Oh! good my lord, said I, pray do not kill a poor little girl like me, send me home again, and be∣stow your favour on some other, who may think splendor a compensation for the loss of liberty.—Take her away, said he, she is beneath my anger</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, how is it Fetnah, that you have covceived such an aversion to the manners of a country where you were born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken.—I was not born in Algiers, I drew my first breath in England; my father, Ben Has∣san, as he is now called, was a Jew. I can scarcely re∣member our arrival here, and have been educated in the Moorish religion, tho' I always had a natural an∣tipathy to their manners,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps imbibed from your mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; she has no objection to any of their customs, except that of their having a great many wives at
<PB N="9" REF="027655_0013_0FD569814A937D30"/>
a time. But some few months since, my father, (who sends out many corsairs,) brought home a female cap∣tive, to whom I became greatly attached; it was she, who nourished in my mind the love of liberty, and taught me, woman was never formed to be the abject slave of man. Nature made us equal with them, and gave us the power to render ourselves superior.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what nation was she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>She came from that land, where virtue in either sex is the only mark of superiority.—She was an Ameri∣can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is she now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FETNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is still at my father's, waiting the arrival of her ransom, for she is a woman of fortune. And tho' I can no longer listen to her instructions, her precepts are engraven on my heart, I feel that I was born free, and while I have life, I will struggle to remain so.</P>

<P>Oh! blessed hope, I feel within myself, that spark of intellectual heavenly fire, that bids me soar above this mortal world, and all its pains or pleasures—its plea∣sures! Oh!—long—long since I have been dead to all that bear the name.—In early youth—torn from the husband of my heart's election—the first only object of my love—bereft of friends cast on an unfeeling world, with only one poor stay, on which to rest the hope of future joy.—I have a son—my child! my dear Au∣gustus—where are you now?—in slavery.—Grant me patience Heaven! must a boy born in Columbia, claiming liberty as his birth-right, pass all his days in slavery.—How often have I gazed upon his face, and fancied I could trace his father's features; how often
<PB N="11" REF="027655_0015_0FD569875A6E3C40"/>
have I listen'd to his voice, and thought his father's spirit spoke within him. Oh! my adored boy! must I no more behold his eyes beaming with youthful ar∣dour, when I have told him, how his brave country∣men purchased their freedom with their blood.— Alas! I see him now but seldom; and when we meet to think that we are slaves, poor, wretched slaves each serving different masters, my eyes o'erflow with tears.—I have but time to press him to my heart, en∣treat just Heaven, to protect his life, and at some fu∣ture day restore his liberty.</P>

<P>How readily does the sordid mind judge of others by its own contracted feelings; you, who much I fear, worship no deity but gold, who could sacrifice friend∣ship, nay, even the ties of nature at the shrine of your idolatry, think other hearts as selfish as your own;— but there are souls to whom the afflicted never cry in vain, who, to dry the widow's tear, or free the captive, would share their last possession.—Blest spirits of phi∣lanthropy, who inhabit my native land, never will I doubt your friendship, for sure I am, you never will neglect the wretched.</P>

<P>What a sweet morning, I could not sleep, so the moment the doors were open, I came out to try and amuse myself.—'Tis a delightful garden, but I be∣lieve I should hate the finest place in the world, if I was obliged to stay in it, wether I would or no. If I am forced to remain here much longer, I shall fret my∣self as old and as ugly as Mustapha. That's no mat∣ter, there's nobody here to look at one, but great, black, goggle-ey'd creatures, that are posted here and there to watch us. And when one speaks to them, they shake their frightful heads, and make such a hor∣rid noise—lord, I wish I could run away, but that's im∣possible; there is no getting over these nasty high walls. I do wish, some dear, sweet, Christian man, would fall in love with me, break open the garden gates, and car∣ry me off.</P>

<P>Bravo! Excellent! Bravissimo!—Why, 'tis a little body; but ecod, she's a devil of a spirit.—It's a fine thing to meet with a woman that has a little fire in her composition. I never much liked your milk-and-water ladies; to be sure, they are easily managed— but your spirited lasses require taming; they make a man look about him—dear, sweet, angry creatures, here's their health. This is the summum-bonum of all good:—If they are kind, this, this, makes them appear angels and goddesses:—If they are saucy, why then, here, here, in this we'll drown the re∣membrance of the bewitching, froward, little devils —in all kind of difficulties and vexations, nothing helps the invention, or cheers the courage, like a drop from the jorum.</P>

Oh insupportable!—there is one way, and only one, by which I can fulfiill my promise to the Dey, preserve my friends and not abjure my faith.— Source of my being, thou can'st read the heart which thou hast been pleased to try in the school of adversity, pardon the weakness of an erring mortal—if rather than behold a father perish;—if, rather than devote his friends to death, I cut the thread of my existence, and rush unbidden to thy presence.—Yes, I will to the mosque, perform my promise, preserve the valu∣ed lives of those I love; then sink at once into the silent grave, and bury all my sorrows in oblivion.</P>

<SPEAKER>REBECCA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Muley, you see before you a woman unused to forms of state, despising titles: I come to offer ran∣some for six Christian slaves. Waiting your leisure, I was informed a Christian maid, to save her father's life, meant to devote herself a sacrifice to your embra∣ces. I have the means—make your demand of ran∣som, and set the maid, with those she loves, at liberty.</P>

<P>Woman, the wealth of Golconda could not pay her ransom;—can you imagine that I, whose slave she is; I, who could force her obedience to my will, and yet gave life and freedom to those Christians, to purchase her compliance, would now relinquish her for paltry gold; contemptible idea.—Olivia, I spare you some few moments to your father; take leave of him, and as you part remember his life and liberty depends on you.

<P>Early in life, while my brave countrymen were struggling for their freedom, it was my fate, to love and be beloved by a young British officer, to whom, tho' strictly forbid by my father, I was privately married.</P>

<P>Married! say you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REBECCA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father soon discovered our union; enraged, he spurned me from him, discarded, cursed me, and for four years I followed my husbands fortune, at length my father relented; on a sick bed he sent for me to attend him; I went taking with me an infant son, leav∣ing my husband, and a lovely girl, then scarcely three years old▪—Oh heavens! what sorrows have I known from that unhappy hour. During my absence the the armies met—my husband fell—my daughter was torn from me; what then avail'd the wealth my dying father had bequeathed me;—long—long did I lose all sense of my misery, and returning reason shewed me the world only one universal blank. The voice of my darling boy first call'd me to myself, for him I strove to mitigate my sorrow; for his dear sake I have en∣dured life.</P>

<P>In the battle you mention, I was indeed severely wounded, nay, left for dead in the field; there, my faithful servant found me, when some remaining signs of life encourag'd him to attempt my recovery, and by his unremitting care I was at length restored; my first returning thought was fixed on my Rebecca, but after repeated enquiries all I could hear was that your father was dead and yourself and child removed far∣ther from the seat of war. Soon after, I was told you had fallen a martyr to grief for my supposed loss.— But see my love, our daughter, our dear Olivia; hea∣ven preserved her to be my comfertor.</P>

<P>After peace was proclaimed with America, my du∣ty called me to India, from whence I returned with a ruined constitution.

<L>Bless me! I'm almost terrify'd to death.</L>
<L>Yet sure, I had no real cause for fear,</L>
<L>Since none but liberal—generous friends are here.</L>
<L>Say—will you kindly overlook my errors?</L>
<L>You smile.—Then to the winds I give my terrors.</L>
<L>Well, Ladies tell me—how d'ye like my play?</L>
<L>"The creature has some sense," methinks you say;</L>
<L>"She says that we should have supreme dominion,</L>
<L>"And in good truth, we're all of her opinion.</L>
<L>"Women were born for universal sway,</L>
<L>"Men to adore, be silent, and obey."</L>
</LG>

<L>True, Ladies—bounteous nature made us fair,</L>
<L>To strew sweet roses round the bed of care.</L>
<L>A parent's heart, of sorrow to beguile,</L>
<L>Cheer an afflicted husband by a smile.</L>
<L>To bind the truant, that's inclined to roam,</L>
<L>Good humour makes a paradise at home.</L>
<L>To raise the fall'n—to pity and forgive,</L>
<L>This is our noblest, best prerogative.</L>

<L>Of all your clemency I stand in need.</L>
<L>To own the truth, the scenes this night display'd,</L>
<L>Are only fictions—drawn by fancy's aid.</L>
<L>'Tis what I wish—But we have cause to fear,</L>
<L>No ray of comfort, the sad bosoms cheer,</L>
<L>Of many a Christian, shut from light and day,</L>
<L>In bondage, languishing their lives away.</L>

<L>Say!—You who feel humanity's soft glow,</L>
<L>What rapt'rous joy must the poor captive know;</L>
<L>Who, free'd from slavery's ignominious chain,</L>
<L>Views his dear native land, and friends again?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If there's a sense, more exquisitely fine,</L>
<L>A joy more elevated, more divine;</L>
<L>'Tis felt by those, whose liberal minds conceiv'd,</L>
<L>The generous plan, by which he was reliev'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first this glorious universe began,</L>
<L>And heaven to punish disobedient man;</L>
<L>Sent to attend him, through life's dreary shade,</L>
<L>Affliction—poor dejected, weeping maid.</L>
<L>Then came Benevolence, by all rever'd,</L>
<L>He dry'd the mourner's tears, her heart he cheer'd;</L>
<L>He woo'd her to his breast—made her his own,</L>
<L>And Gratitude appear'd, their first-born son.</L>
<L>Since when, the father and the son has join'd,</L>
<L>To shed their influence o'er the human mind:</L>
<L>And in the heart, where either deign to rest,</L>
<L>Rise transports, difficult to be express'd.</L>
<L>Such, as within your generous bosoms glow,</L>
<L>Who feel return'd, the blessings you bestow.</L>
<L>Oh! ever may you taste, those joys divine,</L>
<L>While Gratitude—sweet Gratitude is mine.</L>
