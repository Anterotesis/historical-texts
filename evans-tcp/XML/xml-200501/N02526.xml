<OPENER><SALUTE>Kind Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now above thirty years since I first com∣piled this short Manuel, during which time several Impressions have sold off, and each time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has been Reprinted, it has been enlarged, and now this fourth Edition, thou wilt find many Additions, in order to make it more useful than heretofore. And the going off of the former Editions are a better Argument of the Usefulness of the ensuing Book, than any Recommanda∣tion a Preface could give. However, I will adventure to Recommend it as Useful and Ne∣cessary if these <HI>American</HI> Parts, where Books of this Nature are not frequently to be got, and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to say, that Elder People, as well as the Youth, may receive benefit and Advantage by it, by instructing them not only in <HI>True Spelling</HI> and <HI>Reading true English,</HI> with the Rules of <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> but also you have the Copies of Letters upon most Subjects. And <HI>lastly</HI> This small Treatise will supply you with <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Presidents</HI> of most sorts of <HI>Legal Writings</HI> that the Country has occasion for, ready drawn up to your hands, and save you the Charge not only of a Lawyer, Scrivener, or one that un∣derstands these Matters, but also Time and

Expence in Travelling to seek such a Person; and likewise enables the Country-man to do that Business himself which may not be proper for others to know, but to be kept private.</P>
<P>But not to detain the <HI>Kind Reader</HI> with a long Preface, I Recommend him to the perusal of the several subject Matters contained in the following Sheets, which if they prove Profitable and answer the Readers Expectation, I shall be satisfied, and 'twill encourage us to Collect and Publish some other useful Matters that may be further Advantagious to the Coun∣try in general, and the better enable the diligent to perform their several Callings, Profession and Imployments which Providence; may allot to every of us.

<P>THERE is no Building without a Foundation.

<P>These are in Number <HI>Twenty four,</HI> and are to be consi∣dered in their <HI>Form,</HI> their <HI>Nature,</HI> and their <HI>Force.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. As to their <HI>Form,</HI> Letters are e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther <HI>Small,</HI> as a, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, c,<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or <HI>Great</HI> (which ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Capitals</HI>) as <HI>A, B, C. &amp;c.</HI> And to know when rightly to use the <HI>one▪</HI> and when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ is the first step towards good <HI>Clerk-ship;</HI> wherein th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Rule will guide you.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002997_0011_0FEFABAB323BC978"/>
You must never use Great Letters in the <HI>míddle,</HI> or <HI>end</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word (unless the whole be wrote so, as <HI>LORD</HI>) but always in the <HI>beginning:</HI> And <HI>there</HI> too; only in these six Cases following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> 1. At the beginning of any Writing. 2. After every Period, or Full-Point, when a new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>. 3. At the beginning of every Line in Poetry, and every Verse in the Bible. 4. Proper Names of all sorts, whether of Persons, Places, or Things, and the like, must begin with them. 5. So also the Names and Terms of Arts, Dignities, Offices, or any other Word of special Note in a Sentence; or to which we pay a particular De∣ference; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, King,</HI> your <HI>Lordship, &amp;c.</HI> And lastly, The Personal Pronoun <HI>I;</HI> must always be a Capital. The small Letters are every where else to be used.</P>
<P>It would therefore be highly ridiculous to write thus:</P>
<P><HI>master</HI> george francklin <HI>the coroner of kent, with</HI> dorothy <HI>his wife, came last</HI> maRch <HI>to</HI> loNDon, <HI>where i met him.</HI></P>
<P>When it should be,</P>
<P><HI>Master</HI> George Franklin, <HI>the Coroner of</HI> Kent, <HI>with</HI> Dorothy <HI>his Wife, came last</HI> March <HI>to</HI> London, <HI>where I met him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> There are two Forms of s used in writing; the long <HI>s,</HI> which is always put in the beginning, or middle of Words, and the short <HI>s,</HI> which only comes in the end, or after another <HI>s;</HI> As <HI>substantial, Assesments;</HI> not <HI>sub∣stantial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> also, That <HI>i</HI> and <HI>n,</HI> the reasons which we shalt mention by and by, are oft-times written thus, <HI>j, v.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Nature of Letters, they are either <HI>Vowels</HI> or <HI>Consonants.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Vowels</HI> are commonly counted but five, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR>
<PB N="3" REF="002997_0012_0FEFABADE3567E58"/>
<HI>a, e, i, o, u,</HI> but we must add to them <HI>y,</HI> when it cometh after a <HI>Consonant.</HI></P>
<P>All the rest are <HI>Consonants,</HI> and so are <HI>j, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>y,</HI> when any of them come before a <HI>Vowel.</HI></P>
<P>They are called <HI>Vowels,</HI> (which is as much as to say <HI>Self-Sounders</HI>) because each of them gives a perfect sound of it self; whereas the <HI>Consonant</HI> (that is, <HI>Sounders toge∣ther with</HI>) cannot be pronounced without out of the <HI>Vow∣els:</HI> As, to say <HI>B,</HI> you must make use of the sound <HI>e</HI> after it; and in <HI>q,</HI> of <HI>u,</HI> and in <HI>m</HI> or <HI>s,</HI> of <HI>e,</HI> before them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When two <HI>Vowels</HI> come together, and yet are not par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed in Pronunciation, but the sound of them both united, it is called a <HI>DIPHTHONG</HI> [that being originally a Greek Word, signifying a <HI>Double Sound</HI>] As <HI>heard, sweet, People;</HI> not <HI>he-ard, swe-et, People.</HI></P>
<P>Of these <HI>Diphthongs</HI> we have <HI>Twelve</HI> that are chiefly to be observ'd; that is to say, <HI>ai, ei, oi, au, eu, ou, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, ea, eo, oa,</HI> and <HI>ie:</HI> As in these Words, <HI>Faith, Either, Join, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch, Stant, Seed, Food, Wealth, People, Beat, Friend.</HI></P>
<P>Where you may observe, that in the <HI>first six,</HI> both <HI>Vowels</HI> are fully founded; but in the <HI>last,</HI> one of the <HI>Vow∣els</HI> is but little, or scarce at all heard; and therefore by some they are called <HI>improper Dipthongs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That <HI>ay, ey, oy,</HI> are also <HI>Diphthongs,</HI> and have the same sound with <HI>ai, ei, oi;</HI> only <HI>these</HI> are used in the beginning or middle of Words, <HI>those</HI> always in the end; so we write, <HI>air, fair, Heifer, either, Cheister;</HI> not <HI>ayr, fayr, eyther, Cleyster;</HI> but <HI>May, Joy, Whey, &amp;c.</HI> not <HI>Mai, Joi, Whei.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aw, ew, ow,</HI> are likewise <HI>Dipthongs,</HI> and have the same sound with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, </HI> and <HI>ou,</HI> save that <HI>those</HI> are used chiefly in the end of Words. And ow is sound∣ed flat and soft; as <HI>A Bow, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> whereas <HI>ou</HI> is more sharp and shrill, as <HI>Thou, you, adieu,</HI> Yet, contrary to
<PB N="4" REF="002997_0013_0FEFABB153269298"/>
this Rule, we do commonly write these Words follow∣ing of a sharp sound, with <HI>ow, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To Bow, A Cow, Flower, Fowl, How, Power, Sow, Vowel.</HI> Again, on the other side, we write some with <HI>ou,</HI> and yet pro∣nounce them as flat as the sound of <HI>ow,</HI> in <HI>know,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Four, Soul, drought.</HI> But certainly it is an Inconveniency, that Words under one and the same manner of Writing, should have a double and different Sound: To remedy which, some preferring <HI>Reason</HI> before corrupt <HI>Custom,</HI> use <HI>ow</HI> where ever the Sound is soft and flat, either in the begin∣ning, middle, or end of a word; but <HI>ou</HI> where it is sharp: And write thus:</P>
<P><HI>I want Strength to</HI> bou <HI>this</HI> Bow.</P>
<P><HI>Do you</HI> mow <HI>the Grass, and I will lay it up in the</HI> Mow.</P>
<P><HI>Toe; Pease I</HI> sow <HI>to Fat the</HI> Sou, <HI>not the</HI> Cou. Hou <HI>can I make up the Hop-Garden without a</HI> How? Others distin∣guish them by adding <HI>e,</HI> As Jane <HI>is an ill-bred</HI> Sow, <HI>and cannot</HI> so we.</P>
<P>But I take the other writing to be more natural,</P>
<P><HI>AE</HI> and <HI>oe</HI> (which have peculiar Characters, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>AE</HI> and oe) are not properly <HI>English Diphthongs,</HI> but <HI>Latin,</HI> and therefore we in <HI>English</HI> do, for them, commonly both write and sound the single <HI>e.</HI> As <HI>Equity, Femele, Phenix, Tragedy,</HI> from <HI>AEquitas, Foemina, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oenix, Tragoedia.</HI> Yet, in borrowed Words, of rare use, and especially in proper Names, as <HI>AEneas, AEtna, OEconomy,</HI> &amp;c. The best Authors use the <HI>Diphthongs,</HI> to denote their Origi∣nal.</P>
<P>Question, <HI>When two Vowels come together, Is it always a</HI> Diphthong?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> No, not always; but generally where any of the before-mentioned Pairs of <HI>Vowels</HI> happen together, they make a <HI>Diphthong,</HI> and must be sounded jointly, except in these Words following:</P>

<P><HI>Oi</HI> in <HI>Doing</HI> and <HI>Going.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise, most <HI>Vowels</HI> that come together like <HI>Diphthongs,</HI> are parted in all proper Names of Persons or Places men∣tioned in the <HI>Bible,</HI> As <HI>La-ish, Alphe-us, Cesure-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Gill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-ab, Abine-am, &amp;c.</HI> save only <HI>Cain, Cainan, Theudas, Rubem,</HI> and <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> where the <HI>Vowels</HI> are sounded together as <HI>Diphthongs</HI></P>
<P>In all such Words where two <HI>Vowels</HI> come together they are to be <HI>parted,</HI> that they may not seem to make a <HI>Diphthong.</HI> If you would <HI>write exactly,</HI> you ought to make this Mark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over the latter <HI>Vowel,</HI> which is called <HI>Diaeresis,</HI> or a <HI>Note of Partition,</HI> thus <HI>Laiety, Capernaum, Gilead, &amp;c.</HI> Tho' this, thro' the Negligence of Printers and Writers, is often omitted.</P>
<P>There are some few Words derived from <HI>French,</HI> where three <HI>Vowels</HI> are joyn'd in our sound; as <HI>Lieutenant, Beauty, &amp;c.</HI> which may be called <HI>Triphthongs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That altho' we have but 24 Letters, and fix of them <HI>Vowels,</HI> are we have 21 <HI>Consonants;</HI> For I, U and Y, when they are set before any <HI>Vowels</HI> in the same <HI>Syllable,</HI> do become <HI>Consonants.</HI> And in such a Case, the two former must be Written with a different Character from that which they have when they are <HI>Vowels, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> j</HI> and <HI>v,</HI> (which by Learned Men and Printers, are called <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

And in such a case I know no need of a Tittle over <HI>j,</HI> which yet you must always make over <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' y keeps one and the same Form, yet whereas, (when 'tis a <HI>Consonant,</HI>) it differs much from <HI>j Consonant.</HI> As may be perceived by these Examples—<HI>jet, yet, jew, yew, joke, yoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Y</HI> being Originally a <HI>Greek Vowel,</HI> is rightly used, <HI>1st </HI> In most Words derived from that Tongue; As <HI>Chrystal, Presbyter, Martyr, Apocrypha, Apocalyps. 2. English</HI> Words that end with the sound of i, may be indifferently writ with a y, or ie; as <HI>Safety</HI> or <HI>Safetie, Beauty</HI> or <HI>Beautie,</HI> but you must never end them with an <HI>i</HI> only, as <HI>Bounti, Safeti,</HI> for we have no <HI>English</HI> words so termina∣ted. 3. When two <HI>ii's</HI> come together, <HI>y</HI> is put in the place of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because it looks handsomer; as <HI>Bury∣ing, Marrying,</HI> (not <HI>Burieing, Marrieing,</HI> nor <HI>Buriing, Marriing</HI>) and sometimes when <HI>e</HI> followeth, as <HI>Marryeth, Buryeth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Syllables, and Rules how to divide them.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very necessary both for <HI>True Writing</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> to understand the Nature and proper Division of <HI>Syl∣lables.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Syllable</HI> is either a <HI>Vowel,</HI> or <HI>Diphthong,</HI> sounding by it self, or joined with one or more <HI>Consonants</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sound, and pronounced at one <HI>Breath.</HI></P>
<P>For since each of the five <HI>Vowels</HI> make a perfect Sound, any of them may be, and often is a <HI>Syllable,</HI> as <HI>a-hate, e-ve-ry, i-vie, o-pinion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> So most of the <HI>Diph∣thongs,</HI> as <HI>an-ger, En-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, ow-ner, ai-der ai-ster, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002997_0016_0FEFABB85C2156F8"/>
Many <HI>Consonants</HI> with one <HI>Vowel</HI> may make but one <HI>Syllable;</HI> as <HI>Length, Strength, Knights.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Rule, If two <HI>Vowels</HI> come together in a Word, and yet are no <HI>Diphthong,</HI> but both fully sounded, they must be divided, as in <HI>Di-et, Mu-tu-al, Tri-umph, Co-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Co-equal.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Rule, If the same <HI>Consonant</HI> be doubled in the mid∣dle of a Word, they must be divided; as in <HI>Ab-be, Ac∣cord, Ad-der, Af-fect, Ag-gra-vate,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. Rule, A <HI>Consonant</HI> coming between two <HI>Vowels,</HI> must be joined to the latter; as in <HI>E-qui-tie, De-liver;</HI> not <HI>Eq∣uit-i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Del-iver.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Rule, Two <HI>Consonants</HI> between two <HI>Vowels</HI> do sepa∣rate themselves, one to the former, the other to the latter <HI>Syllable;</HI> as <HI>Stran-ger, For-tune.</HI></P>
<P>But no these general Rules, there are these <HI>Exceptions</HI> following.</P>
<P>First, <HI>x,</HI> in any Word, must be joined to the <HI>Vowel</HI> before it, contrary to the third Rule; as <HI>Ox-en, Ex-ercise.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason is, because 'tis a double <HI>Consonant,</HI> and has the sound of <HI>c</HI> and <HI>s,</HI> which cannot begin a <HI>Syllable,</HI> For,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Any two or three <HI>Consonants,</HI> which may be joined to begin any <HI>English</HI> Word, are not to be sepera∣ted in the middle of any Word; so you must not spell <HI>ag-ree, bes-tow, res-rain,</HI> &amp;c. but <HI>a-gree, be-strow, re∣srain,</HI> because <HI>gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st,</HI> and <HI>fr</HI> do begin several <HI>English</HI> Words, as in the following Example.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Consonants</HI> that may begin Words, are Thirty in Number, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>If these Rules for dividing so <HI>Syllables</HI> seem too tedious and intricate, a little practice and observation will render them easy and familiar: In the mean time take this for a general Direction, <HI>That Syllables are so to be divided in Spelling as they are in Speaking.</HI> And be sure if you can∣not write a whole Word at the end of a Line, break it off at the end of a Syllable; as for Example, <HI>Communi∣in</HI> one Line, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion</HI> in the next, not <HI>Communic-</HI> in one Line, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion</HI> in the next; so if I should write <HI>discharge</HI> at the end of a Line thes, <HI>discharge,</HI> it would be ridicul∣ous, for if I could not bring it in all, I ought to have left off after <HI>dis,</HI> and begun the next Line with the other Syllable.</P>

<HI>I will</HI> Write <HI>to my Lawyer for a Writ</HI></P>
<P>Nay, this <HI>e final</HI> does not only draw out the <HI>Syllable</HI> after one <HI>Consonant,</HI> but sometimes effects the same after two; as in <HI>Finde, Minde, Winde, Rinde, Binde, Waste, Taste, Tithe, Childe,</HI> which therefore ought to be so written.</P>
<P>Yet these following Words seem priviledg'd by Custom, to be pronounc'd long, without an <HI>e</HI> in the end, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Bold, cold, hast, post, told, scold, bolt, Golt, dolt, most, Ghost, both, Ruth;</HI> but if any should add an <HI>e</HI> to them, tho' it might seem <HI>unfashionable,</HI> I could not blame him, because 'tis but reasonable: But in other Words 'tis a self-contra∣diction to add <HI>e</HI> in the end, which makes a <HI>Syllable</HI> long, after I have made it short with two <HI>Consonants;</HI> and there∣fore I must write, <HI>pass, turn, black;</HI> not <HI>passe, turne blacke.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another Reason for writing <HI>e final</HI> when not sounded, is to soften the sound of these two Letters, <HI>c</HI> and <HI>g,</HI> as in <HI>Ace, place, lice, truce, Justice;</HI> whereas otherwise <HI>c</HI> sounds strong, like <HI>k,</HI> as in <HI>ac-cept, ac-count,</HI> and the like of <HI>g,</HI> as in <HI>stag</HI> and <HI>stage, hug</HI> and <HI>huge, swing</HI> and <HI>swinge, string</HI> and <HI>fringe.</HI></P>
<P>And here <HI>Note,</HI> That if <HI>g</HI> be hard with a long Vowel, <HI>ue</HI> is added, and always pronounc'd in the same Syllable, as <HI>Plague, Rogue, Prague,</HI> the <HI>Hague, Intrigue, Catalogue, Dialogue, Prologue, Epilogue, Synagogue, Collegue, Prorogue, League, Tongue.</HI> Beware that you do not read such Words <HI>Catalo-gue, Intri-gue,</HI> nor write them <HI>Catalog, Prolog,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if <HI>g</HI> be short, with a short Vowel, then it must have <HI>d</HI> before it, as in <HI>badg, ledg, bridg, lodg, judg,</HI> which Words are thereby differenced both in Sound and Writing, from <HI>bag, leg, log, jug.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another use of <HI>e</HI> at the end of Words, is for <HI>Oxna∣ment,</HI> rather than <HI>Necessity;</HI> for so we add it to Words ending in <HI>i, o,</HI> or <HI>u,</HI> as <HI>Charitie, Vertue, Foe, Toe,</HI> where it does not vary the Sound, except after <HI>i,</HI> and there it makes the <HI>Syllable</HI> sound more gently, like the <HI>Diphthong ee,</HI> as <HI>Charitie</HI> is pronounc'd, as if it were written <HI>Charitee.</HI> Like∣wise in <HI>Nouns</HI> and <HI>Verbs</HI> singular, 'tis generally added after the long <HI>s,</HI> joined with another <HI>Consonant;</HI> as <HI>Horse, Curse,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="002997_0022_0FEFABC88BD1B220"/>
to <HI>Nurse, Disburse:</HI> for we do not use to write <HI>Hors, Disburs, Curs,</HI> much less <HI>Hors, Disburs, Nurs;</HI> and I take the reason to be partly because those Words are thereby the more readily varied; As <HI>Nurse, Nurses; Curse, Curseth; Disburse, Disburses.</HI> And especially because the short <HI>s</HI> after <HI>r,</HI> with∣out an <HI>e,</HI> makes a soft Sound, as <HI>Wars.</HI></P>
<P>If to <HI>e</HI> at the end of a Word, a long Vowel be added, the <HI>e</HI> is lost, and must be omitted in Writting, as <HI>love, loving,</HI> not <HI>loveing; have, having,</HI> not <HI>haveing;</HI> except these endings <HI>ge</HI> and <HI>ce,</HI> before <HI>able,</HI> as <HI>change, change-able; peace, peace-able;</HI> not <HI>chan-ga-ble, pea-ca-ble.</HI></P>
<P>It is needless to use <HI>e</HI> at the end of a Syllable already made long by a <HI>Diphthong,</HI> and therefore you must write, <HI>gnaw, fear, weight;</HI> not <HI>gnawe, feare, weighte;</HI> except when it is to give a right sound to soft <HI>s,</HI> soft <HI>th,</HI> and to these endings, <HI>ce, ge, ve;</HI> as <HI>please, soothe, peace, siege, leave.</HI></P>
<P>Words of one short Syllable, ending with s <HI>Consonant,</HI> are to be written with a <HI>single Consonant;</HI> and without any <HI>e</HI> after; as <HI>sin, son, sun, at, put, war;</HI> not <HI>sinne, sonne, sunne,</HI> &amp;c. altho' such Words are so writ in our old <HI>Bibles,</HI> and after the same manner in the Plural, <HI>sinnes sonnes,</HI> &amp;c. But this is reform'd in our later Impressions.</P>
<P N="6">6. G is not sounded, tho' written, in <HI>Sign,</HI> and its Com∣positions, <HI>Assign, Resign, Design, Consign;</HI> nor in <HI>Seignior, Reign, Sovereign, Arraign, Phlegm,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>H</HI> has Place, but no Voice, in <HI>Authority, Christ, Christopher, Chrystal, Chrysostom, Chronick, Chronology, Chronography, Ghost, John, Rhide, Rhenish, Rhetoric, Sche∣dule, Schism,</HI> and <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>I</HI> is not much, if at all, sounded in these Words, <HI>Adieu, Juice, Pursuit, Bruit, Fruit, Suit, Bruise;</HI> yet in the five last, it draws the Syllable long.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>K</HI> is not heard in <HI>Back, Deck, Sick, Rock, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uck,</HI> &amp;c. for the <HI>Latines</HI> made the same sound with <HI>c</HI> alone, as <HI>Lac, Nec, Dic, Hec, Duc;</HI> and our best Authors do now write such Words, when deduced from the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latine,</HI> in <HI>ous,</HI> with <HI>c</HI> only, as <HI>Public, Physic, Catholic.</HI> But if the

<P N="13">13. <HI>U</HI> is written many times after <HI>g,</HI> when it has no Sound; as <HI>Guide, Guardian,</HI> &amp;c. and always after <HI>q;</HI> as in <HI>Queen, Quick,</HI> and the like.

<P>I have been the longer upon this Rule, that my Young Learner may have full and plain Instructions, in relation to the true knowledge of the Sound of those Letters which ought to be Written, and particularly the Letter <HI>e,</HI> which, tho' the second <HI>Vowel,</HI> affords more variety of Instruction, than any of the other: So that by following carefully the Observation I have made, the Learner will know when this significant Letter must, or must not be written at the end of <HI>a</HI> Word.</P>

<P>In short <HI>Syllables</HI> you must write <HI>c</HI> before <HI>k,</HI> if a <HI>Vowel</HI> go before, as <HI>Buck, Thick, Stick,</HI> and the Reason, as I told you a little before, is, because <HI>k</HI> is never doubled; but if a <HI>Consonant</HI> come before <HI>k,</HI> there is then no need of <HI>c,</HI> as <HI>Banks, Barks;</HI> nor <HI>Bancks, Barcks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>C</HI> is to be written after <HI>x,</HI> in some Words derived from the <HI>Latin,</HI> as <HI>Exceed, Excel, Excessive;</HI> not <HI>Exeed, Exel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ch</HI> in meer <HI>English</HI> Words, or such as are derived from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> sounds <HI>chee,</HI> as in <HI>Approach,</HI> and <HI>Acts, Charity;</HI> and if the <HI>Syllable</HI> be pronounced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, you must write <HI>e</HI> before the <HI>ch,</HI> as <HI>Catch, Wretch, Scatch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n;</HI> But in the following Words, borrowed from <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek, ch</HI> has the sound of <HI>k;</HI> as in <HI>Character, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Chederleomer, Antioch, Encharist, Anchor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Chushite, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Malchus, Melchizedoc, Baruch;</HI> And must be read as if they were wrote <HI>Karacter, Kederleemer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Antiok, Baruk,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P N="6">6.

<HI>Ti,</HI> before, a Vowel, generally sounds like <HI>si,</HI> as <HI>Patience, Dictionary,</HI> except when <HI>s</HI> goes before, as <HI>Fustian, Com∣bustian.</HI> And except the Word <HI>tied,</HI> and whenever a Word ending in <HI>ty</HI> hath another Syllable added to it that begins with a Vowel, as from <HI>Plenty, Pienteous; Mighty, Mightier.</HI></P>
<P>T. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> re since the same Sound is frequently to be expressed by <HI>ty,</HI> and sometimes by <HI>si,</HI> (especially in the ends of Words) it will be worth while to understand when, and where, properly to use each, and the Reason thereof.</P>
<P>For your Guidance herein, Pray Observe these Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Generally you must write <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> in Words that end with the sound of <HI>ation, ition, action, iction;</HI> except where there is a double <HI>s,</HI> as <HI>Passion,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> an <HI>sh,</HI> as <HI>Cushion, Fashion;</HI> not <HI>Cution, Fation.</HI> But more particularly,</P>
<P N="2">2. You are to know that the Reason of the different writing of such like sounding Words is this, they are all originally Latin Verbals, derived from the first Supine, which if it end in <HI>tum,</HI> then you write <HI>ti;</HI> if in <HI>sum,</HI> then <HI>fi.</HI> However because all People are not acquainted with <HI>Supines,</HI> I shall here set down those Words of both sons that most frequently occur.</P>

<HEAD>Of Division.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DIvision</HI> is just the contrary to <HI>Multiplication;</HI> for this turns small Denominations to greater, as <HI>Multiplication</HI> turns greater to smaller.

<P>And as I told you before, that the best Proof of <HI>Multiplication</HI> was by <HI>Division,</HI> so I here tell you, that the best Proof of <HI>Di∣vision</HI> is by <HI>Multiplication▪</HI> as I shall, hereafter shew you.</P>
<P>In this Rule of <HI>Division,</HI> you must Observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Dividend,</HI> or Sum to be Divided.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="instructions">
<HEAD>The Rule of Three.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Rule of Three</HI> is commonly called <HI>The Golden Rule;</HI> and indeed it may rightly be so termed; for as Gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all other Metals, so doth this Rule all others in Arithmetick.</P>
<P>Now for your better Information concerning it, you must observe, that there are <HI>Three Numbers</HI> known, by which a <HI>Fourth</HI> (that is unknown) may be found out, which bears like proportion to the <HI>third,</HI> as the <HI>second</HI> doth to the first.</P>
<P>Here also is to be noted, That if your Sums consist of sundry Denominations▪ the the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>third</HI> Number must be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same Denomination, as also the <HI>fourth</HI> and the <HI>second▪</HI> As thus If the <HI>first</HI> number be <HI>Yards,</HI> the <HI>third</HI> likewise must be <HI>Yards;</HI> if the <HI>second</HI> be <HI>Pence,</HI> then the fourth must be <HI>Pence</HI> also</P>
<P>But the greatest difficulty lyeth in the stating the Question.</P>
<P>Therefore observe, <HI>first,</HI> That what you desire to know, or to be resolved in the Question, must be your <HI>Third</HI> Num∣ber: and you have commonly these Words before it, as <HI>What cost? How long? How broad? How much? How deep?</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your Question being stated, bring your <HI>first</HI> and <HI>third</HI> Numbers into one Denomination.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="59" REF="002997_0068_0FEFAC3C113BF108"/>
3. Being your <HI>second</HI> into the least Name mentioned▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> few as you desire the Question to be answered in.</P>
<P N="4">4. Observe whether your Third Number r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ires <HI>More</HI> or <HI>Less;</HI> if <HI>More,</HI> then multiply the middle Number by the <HI>greater</HI> of the two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and divide by the <HI>lesser,</HI> and the Quotient answerth the Question.</P>
<P>But if it require <HI>Less,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen multiply the <HI>Middle</HI> Number by the lesser of the two Extreams, and divide by the greater.</P>
<P>These two-Word [<HI>More</HI>] or [<HI>Less</HI>] being well obser∣ved, the Scholar will understand what he doth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> not to make two distinct <HI>Rules of three,</HI> as most do.</P>
<P>As for Example,</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> 4 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Cloath cost</HI> 12 <HI>s. What will</HI> 6 <HI>Yards cost?</HI></P>
<P>Here the two numbers of one kind are <HI>Four</HI> and <HI>Six,</HI> (<ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR> they both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so many <HI>Yards</HI>) and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shillings</HI> in the same kind with the number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought; for the <HI>price</HI> of six Yards is sought.</P>
<P>Having placed my Numbers, I Multiply my second num∣ber (12) by the third Number 6 and the Product is 72, which I divide by the first Number 4, and the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ient is 18, which shews that 6 Yards will cost 18 shilling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ See the Operation.</P>

How much will</HI> 16 C. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st?</HI></P>
<P>To Resolve which question, I consider that the Demand lying upon 16 <HI>C.</HI> it must be the third Number, and that of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be the first, <ABBR><HI>viz▪</HI></ABBR> 7 <HI>C.</HI> and

<P>THe Art of Guaging is little differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the measuring of Timber; for as a Foot of Timber is 1728 Cubical or Square Inches, and as often as 1728 Inches are found in a Piece of Timber (be it Round or Square) SO many Foot of Timber is contained in the Piece.</P>
<P>So in the Art of Guaging▪ the Gallon of Ale and Beer is agreed on to be 282 Cubical Inches, and the Wine Gallon 23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Gallon of Dry Measure 272 Inches.</P>
<P>Therefore so often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ 282 square Inches are contained in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay Vessel, round or square, so many Gallon of Ale or Beer the said Vessel will hold.

<P>BY the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>England,</HI> a Woman at her Marriage becomes wholly the Man's, together with all her moveable Goods; and if Goods be given to a Married Wo∣man, they all immediately become her Husbands: She cannot Let, Set, Sell▪ Give away or Alienate any thing with∣out her Husbands Consent, not her very Apparel, which at her Husbands decease goes to the Executor or Administrator of her Husband (excepting her necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) which▪ with the Consent of her Husband she may give by Will, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> otherwise by ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>English</HI> Laws.</P>
<P>The Wife, after her Husbands Death, (having no Joyn∣ture settled before Marriage) may Challenge the Third part of his Yearly Rents and Free-Lands for her Life, and also the Thirds of the Rents and Free-Lands which he sold in his Life-time, if she did not consent to the same by a Fine; but she can claim no Thirds of such Lands as her Husband buys▪ when he has Sold them again, and dyeth, if he puts another Persons Name in the Deed, besides himself, when he bought those Lands. But if her Husband dye without a Will in Writing (leaving no Child) she may claim the Thirds, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above) and the Third Part of his Goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for ever, and the other Two Thirds of his Goods go to the next Kindred.</P>
<P>But if she be the Wife of a Free-man of the City of <HI>London</HI> (he dying without Will, leaving no Child, as before) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will Challenge by Law, Three Parts of Four of her Husbands Goods and Chattles, and one Third of the Profits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Free Lands for Life, the Goods for ever.</P>
<P>The Husband must answer for his Wifes Faults, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wrong another by her Tongue, or by Trespass, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make Satisfaction; and pay the Debts that she contracted▪ except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e have given publick Notice that they shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Her.</P>
<P>A Woman cannot hope to have the Thirds of her Husbands Land, which he Mortgaged before Marriage, until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>If a Man and Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are joynt Purchasers of Land, to them and their Heirs, and the Husband dyes without Will, the Wife may sell the Land without the consent of their Children.</P>
<P>The Woman that kills her Husband is to be burnt alive.</P>
<P>A Wife cannot be a Witness for or against her Husband, they two being so much One.</P>
<P>If a Woman brings forth a Child begotten by a former Husband (or by any other) before Marriage, but born after Marriage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the present Husband, this la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er must own the Child, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Child shall be Heir at Law.</P>
<P>If a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth a Child during her Husbands long Absence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> be for some years, yet if he have lived all the time within this Island (<HI>England</HI>) he must Father that Child; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Child be her first born Son, he shall in∣herit that Husbands Estate, if entail'd, or left without Will.</P>
<P>A Woman that doth not hear of her Husband for Seven Years together, may Marry another Man</P>
<P>The Woman upon Marriage looseth not only the Power over her Person, and her Will, and the Property of her Goods, but her very Name, and her own is wholly laid aside, which is not observed in <HI>France</HI> and other Countries.</P>
<P>But then, as the Wife doth participate of her Husbands Name, so likewise of his Condition: If he be a Duke, she is a Dutchess; if he be a Knight, she is a Lady; if he of an Alien be made a Denizon, she is, <HI>ipso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> facto,</HI> so too. If a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree Man Marry a Bond Woman, she is also Free during the Coverture▪ And such is the good Nature of <HI>English Men</HI> towards their Wives, such is their Tenderness and Respect, that they put them to do Drudgery no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hardship, as in some other Countries, but on the contrary, give them the Right Hand every where, and the Uppermost Place a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Table and else-where. So that (generally speaking) <HI>English Women</HI> are the most happy Women in the World.</P>
<P>A Man and his Wife are so fast joined by our Law, that they may not be wholly parted by our Law, but only by Sentence of a Judge, for Adul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AS Husbands have an absolute Authority over their Wives and Estates, so Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers have a more absolute Authority over Children. A Father may give all his Estate (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> entailed) to any one Child, (or to any other Person) and none to the rest of his Children. The Consideration of which keeps some Children in Awe.</P>
<P>A Son, at the Age of 14 may chuse his Guardian, may be an Executor, may consent to Marriage (if he be not an Apprentice) may, by Will, give his Goods and Chattles, and may Covenant and become Bound for Necessaries, as Food, Rayment, Schooling, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At 21 he is said to be of full Age, may then make any Contract, may sell Lands, and may sit in Parliament, which in other Countries he cannot do till the Age of 25.</P>
<P>A Daughter at 7 years may consent to Marriage, though she may afterwards di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent. At At 9 she may consent to a Joynture.</P>
<P>At 12 she is able to Confirm her former Consent to Mar∣riage, and if at that Age she dissent no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, she is bound: She may at that Age bequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath her Goods by Will, become Bound for Necessaries, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At the Age of 13 she may receive her Lands into her own Possession. At 21 she may Let, Sell or bequeath her Lands by Will.</P>
<P>The Eldest Son Inherits all his Fathers Lands (if the Father dye without a Will) and to the Younger Children are disposed Goods and Chattles; and because they have no Lands, they are commonly put out to learn some Profession or Trade.</P>
<P>If there be no Son, the Lands, as well as Goods, are equally divided amongst the Daughters.</P>
<P>A man Marrying a Wife having Land, and she dyeth, leaving a Child that's heard to Cry, and dyeth, the Man shall have the Lands for his Life. This is called <HI>The Court<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of England.</HI></P>

<P>IF any Person Seized in Fee, makes a Feoffment declaring his Will, upon the livery of it unto a Stranger, to be, That the Feoffer shall stand Seized to the use of the Feoffee, during Life, the Remainder to C. in Fee. In this case it is held, That the Feoffer cannot alter this Will by his last Will, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the said Last Will he doth frustrate to former Will, because, say they, the Use is in him, in the remainder upon the Livery; and it is in his Power to sell or dispose of it.

<HEAD>Of Exchange.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Exchange of Money</HI> is of great Antiquity, and is esteemed exceeding, Coi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nodious, excellently useful and bene∣ficial, as well to Kingdoms and Cities in general, as to Mer∣chants and others in particular: And as Money was first invent∣ed to be made of the best Metals, for the avoiding of chargeable and troublesome carriage, and transportation of Commodities from one Place to another in way of Trade: so was <HI>Exchange</HI> of <HI>Money</HI> first invented for the avoiding as well the danger, as the trouble and charge in the carriage of Money from Place to Place; and by reason that the Standards, Stamps, and Sub∣scriptions of Moneys are found to be various and different (no Nation making use of others Coin) Merchants were forc'd for the better performance and carrying on this excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to appoint a certain Exchange, by giving Value for Value, according to the Fineness or Courseness of the Coyns, with
<PB N="170" REF="002997_0179_0FEFAD58410012B0"/>
certain allowance to the Merchant Exchanging.</P>
<P>Seeing then that Exchanges are of such great use and import∣ance, the Merchant ought to have great insight and knowledge in the Coyns of Foreign Countries, that he may be able to reduce one Coyn into the valuation of another, by raising or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> according to the Goodness or Badness of the Metal: that when he hath occasion to draw a Bill of Exchange upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of 100 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here a <HI>London,</HI> to be paid in <HI>France, Holland,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> else where, he may know the Loss or Gain.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Exchange</HI> for Moneys by Bills of <HI>Exchange,</HI> is real∣ly grounded on the <HI>Valuation, Fineness</HI> and <HI>Weight</HI> of the <HI>Money</HI> of every Country according to the <HI>Par,</HI> that is, Value for Value, and on this are the Exchanges of <HI>England</HI> ground∣ed.</P>
<P><HI>Exchanges</HI> are made by Bills, when Money is delivered simply here in <HI>England,</HI> the Bills received for the same to have the Payment in some other Country beyond the Seas, for Goods here bought, or the like, at a certain Price agreed upon: The like is observed beyond the Seas, and the Money received here in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The meaning of a Bill of <HI>Exchange,</HI> in thus to be under∣stood, suppose two Merchants have correspondence and deal∣ing together, the one here in <HI>England,</HI> and the other in <HI>France,</HI> the Merchant in <HI>France</HI> having bought Good of a Man, to the value of 500 or 1000 l. the Man being to come to <HI>England,</HI> comes to the Merchant for his Money, who being perhaps not provided, or otherwise the Man desirous to have his Money paid in <HI>England;</HI> the Merchant upon these or the like con∣fide rations, draws a Bill of <HI>Exchange</HI> for the said Sum upon his Correspondent here in <HI>England</HI> (who perhaps is indebted to him in greater Sums) to be Paid upon Sight, or within such a Time after Sight, either upon Usance, or double or treble Usance, as they agree. To be explain'd, that is two or three Months.</P>
<P>Again, sometimes Gentlemen or other having occasion to Travel beyond Seas, for their Convenience, Pay their Money to a Merchant here at <HI>London,</HI> desiring him to draw a Bill of <HI>Exchange</HI> for the same upon his Factor, or some Merchant with whom he hath Correspondence, at the Place where the Gentle∣men
<PB N="171" REF="002997_0180_0FEFAD59D827D680"/>
do design their Journey; which Bill in ordered to be Paid as aforesaid.</P>
