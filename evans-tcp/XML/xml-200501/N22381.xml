<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE respectable appearance of this crowded au∣dience, and the animated joy which I discover in the countenance of this assembly, hasten me my friends, to congratulate you, on the return of this anniversary. Permit me, on this occasion, to bespeak your candor for the part I am to act, and to request your attention to the observations which may be made, from the words which are recorded, in the 98th Psalm and 1st verse:
"O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvellous things, his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."</P>
<P>In these words, the Psalmist acknowledges the deli∣verance of Israel, to be peculiarly owing to the smiles of Heaven, and thereby he is led to ascribe the glory to the Supreme Being, and to sing praises to his name. I propose from these words—</P>
<P N="1">1st. To make some observations on the general go∣vernment of an Almighty Ruler, this will clearly dis∣cover to us, the duty of gratitude and praise to him, for any mercies received as a people.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To endeavour to shew, that the only way for a people to secure to themselves the Divine superin∣tendance and blessing▪ is by the universal practice of holiness and virtue:—And then I shall apply myself, more immediately to the design of our present meeting▪</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="029556_0004_0FE1E176E928ED20"/>1st. I am to make some observations on the general government of an Almighty Ruler, this will clearly discover to us, the duty of gratitude to him, for any mercies received as a people.</P>
<P>We are all of us impelled by that vanity which rules in the breast of man, in a time of prosperity and suc∣cess,
"to sacrifice to our own skill, and burn incense to our own valour."
In the tumult of self-applause, we exclaim in the language of an ancient King,
"By the strength of my hand, have I done it, and by my wisdom for I was prudent."</P>
<P>The Almighty Governor of the universe, claims it as a prerogative annexed to his royalty, to govern all the events that take place;
"To do his pleasure in the armies of Heaven above, and amongst the inhabitants of this lower world"
—He sendeth war, and he createth peace. He saves and he destroys. This government and superintendance of the world, is but the exercise, of those perfections, which are inherent in him▪ and the necessary and certain consequence of those essential attributes, which properly belong to Deity. Else why do we so often see the finger of an Invisible Being, deep∣ly imprinted on the affairs of the world; unless we sup∣pose those perfections, and those attributes, are exert∣ed to govern this immense system and to preserve the order and harmony thereof?</P>
<P>We cannot presume with any reason, or propriety, that a Being infinitely great; in possession of the most glorious perfections, all powerful and all wise; can re∣main without any concern in the management of the world▪ and an indifferent spectator of the mighty scene. The rise and fall of empires, the revolutions of states and kingdoms, the desolating miseries attendant on a state of warfare, and the inestimable advantages that flow from a peaceful situation, are of too high conse∣quence
<PB N="7" REF="029556_0004_0FE1E176E928ED20"/>
to be unnoticed by him, and left to the opera∣tions of time and chance.</P>
<P>Even the lowest works of his creation are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the notice of his all inspecting eye, nor of too little consequence to feel the influence of his governing hand: For whatever is worthy of his creative power and good∣ness, cannot be supposed undeserving of his providen∣tial dispensations. The ancient epicurean sect of phi∣losophers, had an opinion, as idle as unfounded, res∣pecting the Supreme Being: They supposed that the greatest happiness consisted in freedom from care and pain; and of course that if he interfered in the ma∣nagement of human affairs, and was so attentive to the concerns of his creation, it would disturb his divine composure and felicity; be unworthy of his dignity; and render him less happy than the meanest of his crea∣tures. But this idea arose from very dishonorable con∣ceptions of the Deity; by comparing the infinite nature of the divine mind, with our finite and limited capa∣cities; and without considering the immeasurable dis∣tance between the creature and the Creator. Vain man! who boasts of being lord of the creation; reflect what <HI>thou</HI> art, and whence thine origin: But a mere atom in the universe, sprang from the dust on which thou treadest—compared with creation, small as the insect which floats in the sun-beam. Reflect and be∣lieve that the same Almighty Power which first produc∣ed this stupendous fabric▪ still preserves and governs it; together with the myriads of beings, which inhabit therein—pretend not <HI>then</HI> to set limits to the inscrut∣able ways of Providence, or to bound his universal go∣vernment;
"Canst thou by searching find out God, canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"
It is so obvious to an impartial observer, in many in∣stances,
"that the race is not to the swift, nor the bat∣tle
<PB N="8" REF="029556_0005_0FE1E17EF3857FB8"/>
to the strong▪"
that every unbiassed mind must ac∣knowledge the influence of a superintending Deity, that if he had not in a marvellous manner interposed, events would have terminated in a very different man∣ner.</P>
<P>Human reason stands confounded at the means by which his purposes and designs are often accomplished. We calculate upon measures that have been heretofore prosperous; we anticipate success from our wise and prudent efforts; and in imagination behold the triumph of our boasted schemes, and the full completion of our fond expectations. Soon these airy dreams are neces∣sitated to give place, to affecting realities; the fallacy of our short-sighted calculations are visible; unwilling∣ly we acknowledge the weakness of our mental powers; and are ready to allow,
"that there is a God who judg∣est in the earth."
In order to effect the wise purposes of his government, HE giveth resolution, firmness and valour, to the weak, poureth contempt upon princes, and reduceth the strength of the mighty.</P>
<P>The hearts of all are in his hands, and are so disposed by him, as to answer his designs, and to bring about the ends of his administration. The politicians of the world, the great and the wise amongst mankind, can∣not accomplish any thing against him,
"who is won∣derful in council, and excellent in working:"
Their wisest measures are disconcerted and their most prudent and favorite schemes, are laid low in the dust—thus does he defeat the fallible councils of men—thus does he prove the uncertain dependance on human efforts. All human power and finite causes are limited in their effects also, by him who governs all things—
"Hither∣to shalt thou go and no further;"
is a language that be∣comes none, but the God of Heaven. In vain do the men of the world, project schemes of ambition and
<PB N="9" REF="029556_0005_0FE1E17EF3857FB8"/>
conquest—In vain do they pour forth their mighty men for the battle—In vain do they make their immense preparations. If God sees fit to counteract the ten∣dency of their exertions, and to deny them success; they will end</P>
<L>— "like the baseless fabric of a vision,</L>
<L>And leave not a wreck behind."</L>
<P>This view of the providential dispensations of the Almighty, discovers to us the propriety of the Psalm∣ist's ascribing the glory of the deliverance of Israel to him, and singing praises to his name therefor. It is a duty, which addresses itself to the interests and feelings, of individuals and a people; when they are successful in their just undertakings, when relieved from any im∣pending calamities, and when established in the enjoy∣ment of any blessings, should thankfully acknowledge the goodness and kindness of that Omnipotent Being— whose right hand, and whose holy arm, hath been ex∣tended in their favor.</P>
<P>I now proceed to shew, 2dly—That the only way for a people, to secure to themselves, the Divine super∣intendance and blessing, is by the universal practice of holiness and virtue.</P>
<P>It hath been an observation handed down from the days of Solomon, and all experience hath confirmed the remark that
"righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin,"
or prevailing vice,
"is a reproach to any people."
As naturally as a proper regimen conduces to the health of the human body, does the exercise of the christian virtues contribute to the welfare of the body politic; so on the other hand as certainly as an unrestrained indulgence of appetite and passion will produce the dissolution of the corporeal system; so also will vice and luxury inevitably prove the ruin of any nation.</P>
<P>In a conformity to the Universal Father consists the
<PB N="10" REF="029556_0006_0FE1E181F3055338"/>
happiness of the rational creature. That temper, and those manners which most resemble his, will render happy an individual, and the universal exercise of the same will render us collectively happy.</P>
<P>The history of every age of the world, will shew the connexion between an unfeigned practice of virtue and piety, and the general prosperity; as well, that diso∣bedience to the Divine laws and commands will bring down as a necessary consequence, the just judgments of an incensed Deity. To the posterity of Abraham was promised, on the condition of their
"hearkening unto the voice of the Lord their God, to do his com∣mandments;"
all the success and happiness they could desire individually or socially—
"Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field, bles∣sed when thou comest in, and when thou goest out— The Lord shall cause all thine enemies that rise up against thee, to be smitten before thy face."
As long as Israel continued to obey the laws of their God, they were a prosperous and happy people.
"Happy wert thou O Israel, who was like unto thee O people, saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who was the sword of thine excellence."
But mark the reverse! It is a solemn warning, recorded for those, who should succeed in future times.</P>
<P>When they rebelled against the God of their salva∣tion, when they swerved from their duty to their Maker, calamities grievous to relate, miseries of the greatest kind and degree, were their bitter portion; the fatal effects of which, have continued even to the present day.</P>
<P>We find the prosperity of nations in every successive age, hath been proportioned to their attention to the laws of the Great Governor of the universe:—Even amongst the Heathens (who were ignorant of the true
<PB N="11" REF="029556_0006_0FE1E181F3055338"/>
nature of God,) their public affairs were prospered, according as they observed the rites of their religion, for these had a tendency to preserve within due bounds, their tempers and passions, to heighten their morality, to increase their moderation and temperance, and thus to render them, more worthy of the Divine favor. At no period of their existence, were the ancient re∣publics of Greece and Rome, so flourishing and so suc∣cessful as when they practised most assiduously those duties which their religion (erroneous as it was) enjoin∣ed upon them.</P>
<P>Is it not then, of the highest importance to us, as individuals wishing the smiles of Heaven upon our per∣sonal affairs; as members of a community▪ for whose general prosperity our ardent aspirations ascend to the Great Lord of the system; that we are found in the practice of all the virtues which can dignify and adorn human nature, which will render us great and good as men and as citizens, and which shall lead us to the en∣joyment of eternal glory in a future world? Struck by that monitor within; let us each make a solemn pause, and ask in sincerity our own hearts.—Do we possess and practice the true principles which our holy religion inculcates? Do we reverence the Great God, whose almighty fiat spake us into existence, and at whose nod the nations of the earth rise or fall? Do we humbly supplicate the pardon of our sins, through the intercession of the Atoning Sacrifice, and also for needed mercies? Do we offer up our sincere and thankful acknowledgments for any mercies received? And do we endeavour to lead lives void of offence, towards God, and towards man?</P>
<P>If upon serious reflection, we find this is not our case, then may we be assured that the divine benedic∣tion cannot follow us, and that we are accountable in
<PB N="12" REF="029556_0007_0FE1E183921F34B8"/>
our proportion, for all the ills that may befall our land. "But if our hearts condemn us not, then we may have confidence towards God our Father: And were this universally our truly acceptable condition▪ we might assuredly look for blessings from above; then we might anticipate the joyful sight of a profusion of excellencies to be showered down upon this inherit∣ance; our American
"Israel shall then dwell in safety alone: The fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; his Heaven also shall drop down dew."
I shall now apply myself more immediately to the de∣sign of our present meeting in the application of the subject.</P>
<P>Whoever reflects on the great revolution which we at this time commemorate in the commencement, pro∣gress, and final completion of it; will clearly discover, the marks of that right hand, and that holy arm which gave us the victory. Whilst the wonder and admira∣tion of the world, is raised hereby, methinks it cannot fail to excite religious sentiments in every serious mind, and animate the devotions of every pious breast. Sure∣ly it will have the effect, upon those who are so deep∣ly interested in the event as this assembly, and the peo∣ple of these States, to sing unto the Lord, new songs of gratitude and praise.</P>
<P>Obliged by repeated and unprovoked attacks upon our rights as men, to stand forth in the defence there∣of; and at length
"to jeopard our lives in the high places of the field;"
relying still on the justice of the parent state for redress of injuries received; and still brooding with eager fondness over our former friend∣ships; none wished to dissolve a connexion which here∣tofore had so happily subsisted; (but on the contrary, it is within the recollection of many now present how anxiously we supplicated the God of Heaven, that the
<PB N="13" REF="029556_0007_0FE1E183921F34B8"/>
hearts of our brethren might be again turned towards us:) none even then ventured to anticipate the memo∣rable aera we now celebrate, or dared
"to cut the gor∣dian knot,"
which linked us to an unnatural parent.</P>
<P>Roused at last by repeated provocations; thrown from the protection of her arms; whole hosts of mer∣cenaries transported from the plains of Germany, and landed on our shores in hostile array—In the face of these dangers untried and unknown, confiding in the smiles of Heaven, upon our righteous cause, did the august fathers of our land, as on this day,
"lay the perpetual foundations of peace, liberty, and safety."</P>
<P>Welcome, auspicious day! we welcome thy return: And may this anniversary continue to revolve, rich la∣den with additional blessings to the people of these States; 'till time itself shall be lost in the ages of eter∣nity, and the Prince of Peace shall reign triumphant.</P>
<P>The wonderful train of consequences which succeed∣ed this event, and which finally terminated in the es∣tablishment of our independence, could only be fore∣seen, by that Being, whose providence is a "wheel within a wheel;" and whose eye pervades the universe at once. The superintendance of that Being, it be∣comes us thankfully to recollect, and gratefully to ac∣knowledge; for we can now look back, on the dangers we escaped, the hazards we encountered, and the dif∣ficulties we struggled through, with the pleasing reflec∣tion, that by his holy arm, and his right hand, he hath gotten us the victory. Permit me to enquire, my friends, when unaccustomed to the reports of battles, and of fellow citizens slain; what were your feelings, when first you heard the alarms of war, and received the tidings of your brethren slaughtered, on the plains of Lexington? What were the dire sensations of your souls, when you saw your first maritime town wrapt in
<PB N="14" REF="029556_0008_0FE1E1852A2D8410"/>
flames, and heard the sound of contending armies? A recollection of these, will carry your minds, through all the eventful and dubious periods, of the arduous conflict—The storms and sunshine, the glooms and brightness; the doubts and hopes; that alternately succeeded, through a long and tragic war. You will thence be led to contrast the present happy and flou∣rishing state of our country, with that trying and dis∣tressing season; and be induced thereby to offer up the songs of gratitude to the Great Jehovah, that such af∣flictive scenes are passed; and also for the measure of tranquility we now enjoy, while the eastern hemis∣phere is rent with distruction; involved in misery and bloodshed.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable circumstance in the history of the revolution, that the most important and interesting events, on the part of these States, happened each at the very time, when their prospects were most gloomy and most distressing. This was so evident▪ that the an∣nals of mankind previous thereto, will perhaps be un∣able to produce a parallel instance. It appears as if the Almighty intended hereby, to stamp irresistably on the minds of all, the clearest conviction of a Super∣intending Providence: and that if he had not wonder∣fully interposed with his holy arm▪ we had been reduc∣ed to misery and ruin. One particular instance which cannot be passed over, occurred within this State and your own knowledge. When the boasted conqueror of provinces, the pride of Britain; who had carried desolation and distress through the southern States, and was ravaging this part of the Union, bearing down all opposition like a mighty torrent, producing sad scenes of ruin, in his extensive progress; you well remember how pitiable your condition▪ how gloomy and distres∣sing the prospect: Yet all his boasted success, did but
<PB N="15" REF="029556_0008_0FE1E1852A2D8410"/>
prepare him for a more signal reverse, and in the end, heighten and grace our triumph. By an happy and well-timed exertion, this desolating army was compelled at yonder town, to resign themselves and all their implements of war to the allied forces of Ameri∣ca and France; and all their vaunting boasts, of pro∣vinces conquered by their arms, vanished like the mor∣ning cloud, or like the early dew.</P>
<P>That memorable siege will long hold a place in your memory; as it delivered you in particular from the ra∣vages of an incensed foe; and no doubt many of you were personally engaged in the toils and dangers, the success and triumph of it; and this remarkable event was probably an influential mean, in giving peace to our country, and establishing her independence. The important events to which I have only referred, shew with how much reason and propriety, we may use the language of our text; and the propriety of adopting it, will appear in a still more forcible light, if we re∣flect on the goodness of Heaven in disappointing the secret arts, and treacherous designs of our internal enemies, and notwithstanding the combined attempts of open force, secret treachery, and false pretended friends; enabling us to struggle through every diffi∣culty, leading us to an honorable treaty, and giving us a place amongst the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>Since the acknowledgment of our independence; our land has been generally prospered under the smiles of Peace, that meek eyed deity—Hail Hea¦ven descended visitant! Long may'st thou still wave thine olive branch, over this highly favored land; long may the dogs of war be fast bound in chains, and not let loose to fill this hemisphere with havock and des∣truction. But, my friends, such is the pride and am∣bition of the human heart, such the lust of plunder and
<PB N="16" REF="029556_0009_0FE1E190911DF540"/>
domination, that rules in the courts of Kings and Princes: that we must not always expect to be free from those baneful ills, which their avarice and power have spread over the face of the earth. We must not imagine that we have "put off the harness," and may indulge in ease and security; but are yet to use the means in our power, (under the auspicious influence of Heaven.) to place ourselves in a posture of defence. For the despots of the earth, have long viewed us with a jealous eye; and perhaps upon the final success of their present attempts on the Rights of Man in the eastern world, depends the peace, the safety, the inde∣pendence of these States. In this event; which how∣ever I trust the God of Heaven will never permit, for surely he must look down, with an approving eye, upon the wonderful efforts of his offspring, for the recovery of their long lost rights:—In this (I say) or in any event, we should be prepared for the last resort, and be ready to play the man, for the cities of our God. To this end, a firm and indissoluble union of the states, is indispensably necessary; and let not the black design of a seperation, be ever harboured in the breast of any American; for in this case, it does not require the spi∣rit of prophecy, to predict the fate of unhappy Poland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poland, which is empa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ically styled the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranary of Europe, has been subjected to two partitions from the neighbouring powers; each taking to itself those provinces, which best suited their conveniency; in virtue of superior force, without any regard to the sentiments or dis∣positions of the inhabitants. A fatal example.</NOTE> to these States. Next to this, it is essentially necessary, to be in a state of military preparation: No people in in the present situation of the world, can long support their rank and independence without a military force of some kind, a standing army or a well disciplined
<PB N="17" REF="029556_0009_0FE1E190911DF540"/>
militia. The former hath eventually been the bane of Republics, in every age and in very clime. Witness, ye Republics, who once were free, now doomed to to suffer the extreme of despotism. With such as these, usurping Caesar passed the Rubicon—With such as these he humbled the mighty commonwealth of Rome, and forced the Mistress of the World to own a Master in a Traitor. And these are the men, whom the scep∣tered monarchs of the east, are now employing to frus∣trate the designs of God to man, and reduce again to the dominions of a tyrant, millions of people who have never injured them.</P>
<P>A well disciplined militia will afford you ample se∣curity against any attack. It is the most natural resort, in a community like this, whose inhabitants are by na∣ture brave, and are laudably tenacious of their free∣dom. From this you have nothing to fear; their in∣terest is the same with the State. When a country is invaded, they are ready to appear in its defence. They march into the field with that fortitude, which a con∣sciousness of the justice of their cause inspires; they fight for their houses, their lands, their wives and their children, for all who claim the tenderest names and are held dearest in their hearts; they fight for them∣selves, for their liberty, and for their God. But, my friends, bravery without arms, is of no avail▪ num∣bers without discipline, will never defend a country. Permit me then to impress on the minds of all who hear me, the absolute necessity of your being well arm∣ed, and well trained, to your own safety and the secu∣rity of your independance.</P>
<P>To you, my respected friends, in particular, the Officers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Officers of the brigade Cavalry and Artillery, and also of the 62d regiment of militia, were then present, having marched thither in procession.</NOTE> of the militia now assembled; to you, with
<PB N="18" REF="029556_0010_0FE1E193C243C9C8"/>
all deference and respect, would I now address myself in a few words. (Nor do I depart from the line of my duty, whilst I endeavour to inculcate a disinterested love of our country, with which is connected its de∣fence; for this hath been held in high estimation, by the wise and good in every age; and I trust it is in perfect consistence with the genius of the gospel.) To you is committed the sacred deposit of disciplining the mili∣tia, agreeable to the laws of the land. Upon your ex∣ertions in this important trust, depends (under Provi∣dence) the safety of our common country. Guard the deposit with an anxious care. Let your exertions be such as shall redound to your own honor, the welfare and security of the land of our nativity.</P>
<P>And this will best be done, by a prompt and ready obedience to the orders of your superiors in command; by carefully and diligently instructing in the use of arms, those who are placed under your care; and by a firm but temperate execution of the laws. Your trust is too important (independant of the solemnity of the oath you are under) to be frittered away in useless cere∣mony or idle parade; nor can it be expected by any one, that you will permit the time which is appropri∣ated to improvement in martial exercises, to be thus expended. You will seriously reflect, that if in the course of the dispensations of Providence, you should be called to the defence of your country, the lives and limbs of those under your command are in your hands; that they will depend (in a degree) on your skill in your profession, on your knowledge in tactics, on a proper display of your bravery or conduct according to existing circumstances.</P>
<P>An Officer with these impressions on his mind, will studiously cultivate the essential parts of his duty; nor will he give himself leisure, till he becomes acquaint∣ed therewith. He will strive by every method, to in∣duce
<PB N="19" REF="029556_0010_0FE1E193C243C9C8"/>
those who are under him, to be properly and compleatly equipped, and to submit to temporary in∣conveniences for the sake of permanent advantages to themselves and their country.</P>
<P>Methinks I may congratulate my fellow-citizens on the rapid improvement which I observe to be spreading amongst you. May it continue to increase, till this palladium of our security shall be established upon the most respectable footing, and be fully equal to our com∣pleat defence. Pardon me, my friends, for this digres∣sion; the anxious concern I feel for the welfare and happiness of my country, must plead an apology for the liberty I have taken.</P>
<P>I have the most animating confidence that the cloud which at present hangs over us, will ere long be dissi∣pated; and that these unfortunate prospects will ter∣minate honorably for America. But it is an incumbent duty, to use the means which Providence hath placed in our power, to be prepared for whatever may be the issue of this important crisis, and humbly commit our righteous cause to the great Lord of the Universe.</P>
<P>Having by every just and honorable mean, endea∣voured to preserve the inestimable blessing of peace; should we be forced into the war which now desolates the fairest countries in both hemispheres, we can ap∣peal to Heaven for the rectitude of our intentions; we can justly look to him
"who resides on the Heavens,"
for a benediction on our arms, and I trust our united efforts shall be crowned with success.</P>
<P>To conclude—As the revolution we now commemo∣rate, hath been rendered a distinguished blessing, by the advantages which have resulted to the world therefrom, and which may still be expected; so may the citizens of these States never shew themselves unworthy of those favors which the kindness of Providence hath be∣stowed upon them, and placed within their reach; but
<PB N="20" REF="029556_0011_0FE1E1955A6F1AE8"/>
by improving them to the best of purposes, and by the practice of the virtues of christianity, may America rise to the most exalted height of felicity and greatness, and long continue the feat of freedom and of arts, a refuge to the persecuted and distressed of every nation.</P>
<P>Finally—As we, my friends, have assembled THIS DAY, to commemorate the great events I have hinted at; let it not be tarnished by any discordant passions operating on your minds; let nothing unworthy this memorable day, interrupt the harmony which ought to prevail—But throwing aside all party piques, and private quarrels, as inconsistent with the design of our meeting; like a band of brothers united in our coun∣try's cause, let each of us strive to add to the pleasure and to the happiness of it. And may the eternal God, from Heaven, look down with approbation on our conduct, and bless us personally and as a people.</P>
<P><HI>And now unto the King eternal, &amp;c.</HI></P>
