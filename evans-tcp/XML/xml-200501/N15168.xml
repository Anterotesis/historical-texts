<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC FROM THE SOUTH-CAROLINA SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING AND IMPROVING AGRICULTURE AND OTHER RURAL CONCERNS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having gloriously succeeded by the assistance of Divine Providence, and our own exertions, in terminating a war, which for some years past has laid waste our country; it is incumbent upon sanguine
<PB N="4" REF="019254_0003_0FAA6B4BEA3BD808"/>
us equally to endeavour to promote and enjoy the blessings of peace. This cannot be effected by any means more interesting and advantage∣ous, than by turning our attention to the cul∣tivation and improvement of our fields: We ought not only to think of restoring their former appearance, which has been defaced by the horrors of war; but, as by the event of that war the fruits of the labour, we shall be∣stow upon them, are now secured at our own, and not at a master's disposal, we are en∣couraged, and should be induced to make far∣ther exertions for rendering both their beauty, and their produce greater.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE was one of the first employ∣ments of mankind; it is one of the most inno∣cent, and at the same time the most pleasing and beneficial of any. By its variety it keeps the mind amused and in spirits; by its exercise and regularity it conduces to give vigour and health to the body; and in the end it is pro∣ductive of every other necessary and conveni∣ence of life. For agriculture is the parent of commerce; and both together form the great sources, from which the wants of individuals are supplied, and the principal riches and strength of every state flow. It becomes the duty therefore, as well as the interest, of eve∣ry citizen to encourage and promote it.</P>
<P>BUT although our fellow citizens in this, and indeed almost every other of the United
<PB N="5" REF="019254_0004_0FAA6B4C6CD67848"/>
States, have not been deficient in general ex∣ertions of industry in this line of employment; yet they have been too much satisfied with fol∣lowing the methods practised by their fathers, without attempting to discover better by expe∣riments made by themselves; experiments, which every where else have in the end been crowned with success.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that in America in general, the mode of planting and of managing rural concerns has been pretty much the same for fifty years past; except perhaps in the intro∣duction of one or two new articles of produce in a few of the states. It is no less certain, that within that period, by various experi∣ments in Europe, and particularly in Great∣Britain, a considerable and rapid progress has been made in the improvement of every article, which concerns the holder and tiller of land there; and in consequence a new, and almost entirely different, system of husbandry has tak∣en place of the former.</P>
<P>THESE experiments, which were generally made at first by individuals for their own amusement or profit, none but themselves, or their nearest neighbours were benefitted by. They were at length considered as objects of public utility; and numbers of patriotic gen∣tlemen not only undertook to collect and publish accounts of them in different parts of Europe; but by offering prizes, pecuniary,
<PB N="6" REF="019254_0005_0FAA6B4CFAB90908"/>
and honorary, they encreased the spirit of such experiments by emulation and reward, as well as by a knowledge of their success.</P>
<P>WITH the same views we have instituted this society; and to explain and effect our plan, we have thought proper to publish this address to our countrymen and fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>WE recommend to the planters in general (and every one has it more or less in his power) to select a small part of his grounds, in order to make experiments on it by various me∣thods—in turning up and preparing the soil—in planting it in its natural state, and in ad∣ding manure—in trying the effects of different crops in succession to each other, instead of continuing the same (as is commonly practised here) in the same field for a series of years—in tending the crop on the ground by plough∣ing, hoeing, weeding and watering—in ma∣naging it after being removed into the barn and yard—in short, by attempting every new mode, which fancy or judgment may direct. Nor do we wish these experiments to be confined mere∣ly to the cultivation and improvement of the earth and its products; but to be extended to every other object which is connected with a country life—such as raising and feeding cat∣tle and stock of all kinds—planting and grow∣ing live fences, and other wood for firing and building—contriving mills, carriages, and eve∣ry implement of husbandry; and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019254_0006_0FAA6B4DE2E814B8"/>
IN making these experiments it will occa∣sion very little trouble, but it is absolutely ne∣cessary for the planter to keep a regular jour∣nal, and to remark every particular circum∣stance during the course of them. This will bring the whole more immediately to his me∣mory, and under his judgment; and will bet∣ter enable him to draw up that account of the event, which we request of all such to com∣municate to us.—We likewise invite every other person to favour us with his sentiments, and observations on these subjects.</P>
<P>FROM these different accounts we may be able to form an opinion of the best method, which has been attempted; and we shall oc∣casionally publish a collection of such, as in our judgment will tend most to promote the designs of the Society; which centre in the interest and advantage of every member of the state, and consequently of the state itself.</P>
<P>THIS society cannot, in its yet infant state, ascertain what prizes they can afford for the encouragement and reward of the experiments, they recommend. Our number at present is not large; and our income by subscription, which is fixed at a low rate to induce others to join us, is in proportion. When both in∣crease, we shall not be backward in propo∣sing prizes of such value, as may both excite and reward the merit of the candidates.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019254_0007_0FAA6B4ECD0C8F98"/>
The following are the Rules established, principally to model our existence. A little time and experience, as they will increase our knowledge and our means, may hereafter produce others for communicating the first, and applying the last.</P>
