<HEAD>TO That Congregation in Boston New-England, To whom I have for many Years been Preaching the Gospel of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>IT is but a very little Time that I have now to be in the World: on which account I have the greater reason to make what ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I can, to finish the work appointed for me on the Earth; &amp; to Labour (by the help of Christ) to bring forth that Fruit which shall remain after I am gone. I have

considered that <HI>Discourses</HI> on <HI>Doctri∣nal Subjects,</HI> may be of Use (if the Lord see meet to give his Blessing to attend them) for the Edification of believers. Nor have I been al∣together negligent in Endeavours (according to the measure of Grace received) to serve the Generation whereof I am, in that way; having therefore Published my Meditations respecting <HI>the future Conversion of the Jewish-Nation. The Subject of Bap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sm: The Order of the Gospel Profes∣sed and Practised in these Churches: The Ministry of Holy Angels;</HI> And concerning <HI>the Person, Office, and Glory of Christ.</HI> I have also prepared for the Press several Discourses con∣cerning <HI>the New-Jerusalem State of the Church;</HI> and concerning <HI>the First Resurrection,</HI> which I shall leave with those that shall survive me, to dis∣pose of as they shall see cause. But I have observed, That <HI>Plain, Practi∣cal-Sermons,</HI> the design whereof is to

Therefore have I several times Dedicated Books of that nature (and for the same reason I <HI>Bequeath</HI> what is emitted herewith) to You who are <HI>My Flock, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear∣ly Beloved.</HI> Two and Forty Years are this Summer expiring, since I began my Ministry in <HI>Boston.</HI> I thank the Lord, (and I bless You) for the great Love which You and Your Fathers have manifested to me and mine. I have often been temp∣ted to remove from you by more sollicitations than one or two. And if I had done so, perhaps I might have advantaged my self in Outward respects: But when I have consi∣dered Your singular Affection to∣wards me, I could not find in my Heart to do it.

I am thro' the Patience &amp; Goodness of God now past (that which they call the great <HI>Climacterick</HI>) the Sixty Third Year of my Age. Thrice have I been in my Younger Years brought to the Gates of Death by Sickness: But Your Predecessors, and some of your selves, have by your Prayers to God kept me alive.

But therefore let your Prayer for me be that whilest I am in the World I may be ser∣viceable, and that I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipen for Heaven apace.

<Q><P><HI>And they All with one Consent, began to make Excuse.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Lord Jesus Christ was on the Sabbath Day in∣vited to eat Bread in the House of an eminent Pha∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee. Being there he did (as he always used to do) set himself to do good unto those with whom he had his Conversation. In the first place he heal'd a man that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick
<PB N="10" REF="001134_0009_0FB087DA100C71B8"/>
of the <HI>Dropsie;</HI> and then he gave wholsome Counsel unto those that were about him, which te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded to promote the health and salvation of their Souls. He Exhorted them to Humility, and also to Charity and Liberality; and that they should extend their Charity not to Rich men only, that could do as much for them again; but unto such as were Poor and could never make them a∣ny recompence: and he did assure them that if they did so (from a right, principle, &amp; to a right end,) they should be recompensed <HI>at the Resurrection of the Just.</HI> Upon this one present uttered a saying very frequent among the <HI>Jewish Rabbies,</HI> namely, That <HI>they are Blessed who shall eat Bread in the Kingdom of God.</HI> They are blessed that shall have Com∣munion with God, &amp; with his Saints in the <HI>Resurrection world.</HI> Upon this mans thus saying, the Lord Jesus Christ took occasion to speak a Pa∣rable
<PB N="11" REF="001134_0010_0FB087E2ADEEA6D8"/>
concerning <HI>the Great Supper.</HI> By which he did intimate that notwith∣standing they pretended an affection to the Kingdom of God, neverthe∣less the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld had a greater interest in their affections than that King∣dom. For he shewed that many who were invited to the Great Supper, refused to come, and made Excuses for their so doing. The first had one Excuse, the second another, &amp; the third another. Nevertheless, in this they all agreed to Excuse their not coming. When they were in∣vited <HI>with one consent they made Ex∣cuse.</HI> Their Excuses were specious and plausible, and yet unreasonable.</P>
<P>Now for the opening of this Pa∣rable, <HI>By the Great Supper,</HI> Christ and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ Benefits are intended: which are fitly called a Great Supper, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only in respect of the Mult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tude of persons invited thereto, but in re∣spect of the Greatness, the Excellen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Matter of the Fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t▪ Christ
<PB N="12" REF="001134_0011_0FB087E425ECC938"/>
and Eternal Life: and in respect of the Continuance thereof. We read <HI>Esther</HI> 1. 4. that <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asuerus</HI> the Em∣peror of <HI>Persia,</HI> made a Feast for his Nobles and Princes, which continu∣ed for the space of an Hundred and Fourscore Dayes. But this <HI>Great Supper</HI> has infinite Multitudes invited to it; Thousands yea Millions have been called to it. And the Feast will continue not for an hundred &amp; fourscore Days, nor an hundred &amp; fourscore Years, but through out the never ending Ages of Eternity. Therefore it may well be called a <HI>Great Supper.</HI> And as for the Person that did make this Feast, and so call unto it, we are to understand God Himself: Therefore in the Parable, Mat. 22. 2. 'tis said <HI>That a certain King</HI> did it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the God and King of Heaven, <HI>the King Eternal.</HI> And as for the Servants that are said to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sent to call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto this Great Sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, the Ministers of the Lord Jesus
<PB N="13" REF="001134_0012_0FB087F02F5B8518"/>
Christ are thereby meant. As for the Persons invited to this Great Supper, both Jews and Gentiles are intended, &amp; not only the great ones but the meaner fort among them. Therefore it is said, <HI>Go-into the Streets of the City, and call them in,</HI> and it is said, <HI>Go into the High-ways and compel them to come in:</HI> By which the calling of the Gentiles might be signified. The Jews had the first offer of the Gospel made to them. Christ was Preached unto them before unto any other in the world; but few of them would ac∣cept of him, few of them did believe, but with unreasonable Excuses did put off their coming to him.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>That when men are in the Gospel in∣vited to come to Christ for Salvation, they are apt to delay &amp; put it off with Unreasonable Excuses.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001134_0013_0FB087F1B7874178"/>Two things are before us to be shewed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What those Excuses are, and the Unreasonableness of them, whereby men put off their coming to Christ?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Whence is it that men are apt to make Excuses and Objections a∣gainst Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P>Question 1. <HI>What are those Ex∣cuses which men commonly make, &amp; the Unreasonableness of them?</HI></P>
<P>Answer 1. <HI>Men are are ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pretend that their coming to Christ will be prejudicial to their worldly and car∣nal Interests.</HI> Thus here, three are mentioned as Excusing themselves: Two of them their excuse was, it would be prejudicial to their world∣ly profit, the other because it would be prejudicial to his carnal sensual delights. Men are apt to think, that if they come to Christ they shall
<PB N="15" REF="001134_0014_0FB087FE9CE648F0"/>
suffer as to their Outward estate. It may be they shall be Poor then. And indeed tho' the Lord Jesus Christ does not require that all his Disciples should actually part with whatever in the world they enjoy, nevertheless he requires that they be willing to do it when he shall put them upon it. Luk. 14. 32 <HI>He that will not forsake all that he has cannot be my Disciple.</HI> A man must be willing to forsake all the Com∣forts that he has in the world, when ever Christ calls him to it, or he can't be his Disciple. Yet never∣theless, this Excuse is very Unrea∣sonable: For if a man should lose all that he has in the world and gain Christ instead of it, he would be no loser, but an infinite gainer. <HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 8. The Apostle there speaks of <HI>the Unsearchable Riches of Christ.</HI> If a man looses the world and gains Christ, he has unsearch∣able Riches instead of that which he
<PB N="16" REF="001134_0015_0FB087FFE8853310"/>
had in the world. And <HI>Mat</HI> 13. 45. we read of one that did sell all that he had that he might obtain <HI>the Pearl of great price.</HI> Christ is the Pearl of great price. Tho' a a man should part with all that he has in the world, if he gain that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earl he is no loser, but a great gain∣er. No man loseth any thing for Christ, but Christ will make it up to him in this world; if not in tem∣porals, then in spirituals which is far better. Mark. 10. 30. <HI>Who ever shall lose House or Land</HI> (said Christ) <HI>for my sake, and the Gospels, he shall receive an Hundred fold in this present life.</HI> He shall have more Grace given to him if he loses the world, and a little of that is more valuable than a great deal of the world. And he shall have more of inward heavenly Joy in his own soul. As the Chri∣stian Hebrews when their goods were taken away from them on Christs account, took that affliction
<PB N="17" REF="001134_0016_0FB08801B96FB858"/>
<HI>Joyfully.</HI> And much more will the Lord recompense them in the world to come. Therefore the Lord says, he shall have an hundred fold in this world, and <HI>Eternal Life in the world to come.</HI> Now that Eternal Life is of great worth and value, infinite∣ly more than any thing of this world. <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. 21. Sayes Christ to one there, <HI>Follow thou me, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and follow me and thou shalt have treasure in Hea∣ven.</HI> How great is that Treasure? how vast are those Riches? Eph. 1. 18. <HI>That you may understand the Riches of the Glory of the Inheritance.</HI> Riches of glory, a rich and glorious Inheritance. This men should have, if they came to Christ; and there∣fore it is very unreasonable in them to object the profit of the world as their Excuse for their not coming to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Again, Others are apt to Excuse themselves by thinking they shall be
<PB N="18" REF="001134_0017_0FB0880333D4C0C8"/>
deprived of their earthly Delights. That they shall never see pleasant Day more; that if they become se∣rious Christians, then they must bid a farewel to all Pleasure in the world. But this is an Unreasona∣ble Objection. For those pleasures which Christ calls his Disciples to renounce for ever, they are sinful ones, and last but for a season. Heb. 11. 25. <HI>The pleasures of Sin are but for a season.</HI> Yea and but for a very short season too. Eccl. 7. 6. <HI>They are like the crackling of Thorns.</HI> If Thorns be set on fire they make a crack∣ling, but they are presently out. And such are the pleasures of Sin: And then they end in dismal sorrow. Prov. 14. 13. <HI>The end of that mirth is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaviness.</HI> The pleasures of sin, the end of them will be heaviness. And the more delight any take therein the greater will their sorrow and misery be in another World. Rev. 18. 7. <HI>How much she hath glori∣fied
<PB N="19" REF="001134_0018_0FB0880825F10EF8"/>
her self &amp; lived deliciously, so much torment &amp; sorrow give her.</HI> The more persons have indulged themselves in the wayes of sin, the greater torment shall be given to them in the world to come. Whereas if they hearken to Christ and come to him, they shall have better pleasures. Prov. 3. 17. <HI>All the wayes of wisdom are pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</HI> They are pleasant, and in them are far greater pleasures than ever any did enjoy in the wayes of sin, Psal. 36. 8. <HI>Thou wilt make them to drink of the rivers of thy pleasures.</HI> Rivers of pleasures are to be en∣joyed by those that come to Christ. And they are pleasures that shall last for ever and ever, Psal. 16. 11. <HI>At thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</HI> Now then for men to refuse coming to Christ because they think they must never enjoy their pleasures any more, whereas those pleasures are but for a sea∣son;
<PB N="20" REF="001134_0019_0FB0880AC8C5C5F8"/>
and if they did come to Christ, they should enjoy better &amp; greater and eternal Pleasures, for them on that account to Excuse themselves is most unreasonable.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are some who are so Un∣reasonable as to Object, that they don't know whether Christ dyed for them or no, and then if they did come to him they should not partale of the Salvation purchased by him.</HI></P>
<P>But to show you the Unreaso∣nableness of this Excuse.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There, is merit enough in the Blood of Christ to save all the men in the world.</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 2. <HI>He is a propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole World.</HI> If all the men in the world should believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, there needs no more to be done that God should become pro∣pitious to them, than that which
<PB N="21" REF="001134_0020_0FB0880D95E62F98"/>
Jesus Christ has already done. His Blood is infinitely Meritorious; and it most needs be so, because of his being not Man only but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also. 1 Joh. 1. 7. <HI>The Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</HI> Inas-much as the Blood of Jesus Christ is the Blood of the Eternal Son of God, it cleanseth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all sin. There is an infinite value and efficacy in it. There is a super-abundant merit in the Blood of Christ. As the repenting Prodigal said, Luk. 15. 17. <HI>There is Bread enough in my Fathers House and to spare.</HI> Even so, there is Merit enough in the Death of Christ and to spare. As for all those thousands of Millions that perish to Eternity, I will say to you, there is not one of them all that does perish for want of a sufficiency of Merit in the Blood of Christ to save them, but because they do not come to him &amp; believe on him. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="001134_0021_0FB0881128A9D210"/>2. <HI>In the Gospel Christ and Sal∣vation by him is offered unto all men.</HI> The offer of the Gospel is as Free and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iversal as possibly can be. Mark 16. 15. <HI>Go and Preach the Gospel to every Creature.</HI> Every man where the Gospel comes, has Christ and Salvation by him tendred unto him. Rev. 22. 17. <HI>Come whosoever will.</HI> What can be more Free or Universal than that invitation of the Gospel, Come whosoever will? And if they come they shall have Life? Heb. 5. 9. <HI>He is the author of eter∣nal Salvation to all them that obey him.</HI> Let never so many obey him, he will be the author of Eternal Sal∣vation to them. And there is not a man in the world, but a Minister of Christ may say to that Man, Do you believe on the Name of Jesus Christ and you shall never perish, but shall have Eternal Life, Joh. 3. 16. <HI>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
<PB N="23" REF="001134_0022_0FB08812A602B680"/>
whosoever does believe on him should not perish, but should have ever∣lasting Life.</HI> In this there is a dif∣ference between fallen Man and fal∣len Angels. It may not be said un∣to the fallen Angels, if you believe you shall be saved by Christ, if you will trust to him for Salvati∣on you shall be saved by him. When Evil Spirits in possessed persons have entred into discourses with men, as oftentimes it hath been so, no man may say to one of <HI>them,</HI> If you will trust to Christ for Salvation, you may be saved. But now this may be said to Men, to every one with∣out exception. So large, so univer∣sal is the offer of the Gospel that the Children of men are made par∣takers of. If a Prince should lay down a Price for the Redemption of a company of Slaves, declaring that whosoever will consent to be his Subjects, the price is laid down for them, how unreasonable
<PB N="24" REF="001134_0023_0FB0881B9B1DB238"/>
would it be for any one of them to say, I don't know it was intended for me in particular: when the Prince their Redeemer said it was in∣tended for all that would consent to be his faithful Subjects. So does the Lord Jesus Christ the Prince of Life say in the Gospel, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid down a Price to redeem the Slaves of Hell, and whosoever will sincerely con∣sent to be my Subject, my faithful Servant, it is for him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The way and the only way for a man to know whether Christ dyed for him in particular, is to believe on his Name.</HI> If any man, tho' a Re∣probate should say Christ has not dyed for me, that man would sin in so saying; for then he would in∣trude himself into that which is a Divine secret. Much more would an Elect Vessel, be guilty of sin, if he should say Christ has not dyed for me. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. 29. 29. <HI>Secret things belong to the Lord, and Revealed
<PB N="25" REF="001134_0024_0FB0881D386E9FF0"/>
things belong to us.</HI> Whether Christ has dyed for such a man in particu∣lar is a secret thing, known unto the Lord only, until by the fruits of it it doth appear. But that such a man ought to Believe on the Name of Jesus Christ: that he ought to come to Christ, and sub∣mit to him is revealed. Then let him do what is revealed, and he may be sure Christ has dyed for him. Yea as sure of it, as if he were now in Heaven <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 20. Sayes the Apostle, <HI>The life that I now live, is by the Faith on the Son of God, who gave himself for me.</HI> If a man has Faith in the Son of God, then he may know that Christ gave him∣self for him in particular. This then is a very Unreasonable Ex∣cuse for not coming to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There are others that to Ex∣cuse themselves pretend they cannot Believe.</HI> (As one here in this Pa∣rable
<PB N="26" REF="001134_0025_0FB0881EB8A6AF80"/>
said, <HI>I cannot come.</HI>) Pretend∣ing they have not power to be∣lieve: Does not Christ himself say, Joh. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. 44. <HI>None can come to me except the Father draw him?</HI> And what would the Ministers of Christ have us do things impossible for us to do?</P>
<P>But to show the Unreasonableness of this Objection.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'Tis mans own fault that he cannot come.</HI> They have made themselves unable to believe. How then will that Impotency Excuse them? It is true, that the Children of men are become impotent, mise∣rable Creatures. Rom. 5. 6. <HI>They are without strength.</HI> But they have made themselves to be without strength. They have sinned away that power which once they had. As <HI>Sampson</HI> when he did hearken to <HI>Delilab,</HI> his strength departed from him, and he became weak. So <HI>Adam</HI> and we in him, hearkening
<PB N="27" REF="001134_0026_0FB08821E31CB948"/>
to Satan, our Strength is departed from us, and we are become weak. <HI>Adam</HI> had power enough to do what∣ever God required of him: There was nothing that God enjoyned on him, but he had power sufficient to do it. Eccles. 7. 29. <HI>God made man upright but they sought out many in∣ventions.</HI> So God gave to man in his <HI>first-state</HI> sufficiency of Power to obey whatsoever he should enjoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on him. But they have sinned away that power, and made themselves unable to do what once they could have done. If a Servant should make himself sick, and neglect doing his work that his Master hath set him about, and then pretend that he was sick, would that be a sufficient Excuse? When it might be said, You did wilfully make your self sick &amp; weak. That would be no rational Excuse for him.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sinners would not believe if they
<PB N="28" REF="001134_0027_0FB0882445F94818"/>
could do it.</HI> They would not come to Christ if they had power to do it. <HI>Mat.</HI> 22. 2. Tis said, <HI>They would not come.</HI> It is not said, <HI>They could not come:</HI> Nay, but <HI>they would not come.</HI> If sinners would speak out and declare the whole truth, they must say, <HI>We neither can nor will come to the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Their <HI>Cannot</HI> is a most wilful <HI>Cannot.</HI> They had rather perish than go to Christ for Salvation. It is a dreadful word to be spoken, <HI>nevertheless</HI> 'tis a true one, That there is such op∣position and enmity in the hearts of men against the holy Lord Jesus Christ, that <HI>they had rather be damned for ever than that Christ should save them.</HI> Therefore did Christ say to the <HI>Jews,</HI> Joh. 5. 40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that you might have Life.</HI> They were told plainly and often enough, that if they did not come unto Christ they should dye in their sins. They were told o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten
<PB N="29" REF="001134_0028_0FB0882C2EDC42F8"/>
enough, that if they did not come to Christ for Eternal Life, they should be sent down to the Tor∣ments of Hell world without end. Yet for all this they would not come to him that they might have Life. That Unbelief which is <HI>the</HI> Damning sin of men that live under the Gospel, it is a wilful Unbelief. Joh. 3. 19. <HI>This is the Condemnation that Light is come into the world and men have loved Darkness rather than Light.</HI> That is the Damning sin under the Gospel, <HI>men love darkness.</HI> And when light is come to them, they shut their eyes and don't care for the light. It is plain that sin∣ners will not come to Christ; that they have no mind to believe, in that they will not do what they can do. They will not do what they have power to do, in order to the obtaining of Faith. God in his Ward has given men directions what to do that so they may obtain
<PB N="30" REF="001134_0029_0FB0882DB68A6ED0"/>
<HI>Precious Faith</HI> in the Name of Christ, and such things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they can do if they would, but they will not, and therefore do they perish. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 23. 37. <HI>I would have gathered you under my wings</HI> (sayes Christ) <HI>but ye would not.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God does command no man in the world to believe by his own strength.</HI> Therefore this Objection this Excuse is unreasonable. When the Lord commanded <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 14. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. saying <HI>Last up thy hand,</HI> take the Rod into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hine hand, lift it up over the Sea, <HI>and divide it.</HI> How unreaso∣nable would it have been for <HI>Moses</HI> to have said, <HI>I divide the Sea!</HI> It is impossible, and therefore for him to have neglected to take the Rod into his hand and lift it up? So it is when God commands sinners to believe, and in order thereunto that they should do such and such things, and yet they will not do, it. I say the Lord requireth no man to
<PB N="31" REF="001134_0030_0FB0882F25C2B7B0"/>
believe by his own power, never∣theless, there are three things that God commands every man to at∣tend where the Gospel comes, and yet there are many that will not obey him.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God requires that they should not refuse and despise the Outward calls of his Word.</HI> Heb. 12. 25. <HI>Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed that ye refuse not him that speaks from Heaven.</HI> Yet they do and <HI>will refuse.</HI> Psal. 81▪ 11, <HI>My people would not hearken to me, they would none of me. They would not, they would not,</HI> (sayes God) no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they would not when the Lord called to them. So Prov. 1. 22. <HI>How long ye Scorn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s will you delight in Scorning?</HI> Can't men choose whether they will de∣light in scorning or no▪ <HI>I called &amp; ye refused,</HI> sayes the Wisdom of God: <HI>You set at nought my Counsels and despised my Reproofs.</HI> God does expect and require from men that they should <HI>neither in word n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r deed</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="001134_0031_0FB088395A6FAF58"/>
say, We will not do what thou com∣mandest, and yet sinners will do thus, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 31. They said, <HI>We are Lords, we will come no more unto thee.</HI> No, we will not come to thee. They said so <HI>Practically</HI> however tho' not Verbally. Yet one time when the Prophet told them what God requi∣red of them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44. 16. they said, <HI>As for the Word which thou hast spo∣ken to us in the Name of the Lord we will not hearken to it.</HI> So it is with sinners when invited to come to Christ, they will not hearken to that word: And therefore to pretend Inability to come is a vain Ex∣cuse.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God requires of sinners that they should not resist the Inward strivings of his holy Spirit.</HI> As that they should not refuse nor reject the Outward calls of his Word, so that they should not resist the Inward strivings of his Spirit: and yet this they do, and this they will do tho' they are
<PB N="33" REF="001134_0032_0FB0883B330927B0"/>
Damned for it when they have done. 1 Thes. 5. 19. <HI>Quench not the Spirit</HI> says God. Ayo, but sinners when the Spirit of God has beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to kin∣dle a holy fire in their hearts, they quench it, they put it out. Thus it was with the sinners of the old world, Gen. 6. 3. <HI>My Spirit shall not al∣ways strive with Man.</HI> The Spirit of God had been striving with them. Righ∣teous <HI>Noah</HI> Preached many power∣ful Sermons unto them: that Preacher of Righteousness would sometimes startle and amaze their Consciences, but they rejected they resisted the Holy Spirit striving in that Ministry. So it was with the rebellious Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> Isa. 63. 10. <HI>They rebelled &amp; vexed his Holy Spirit, therefore he be∣came their Enemy.</HI> And so it was with their Children a long time af∣ter them, Act. 7. 51. <HI>You staff-neck∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and Uncircumcised in Heart and Ears, you do alwayes resist the Holy Ghost</HI> Sinners resist the Holy Ghost
<PB N="34" REF="001134_0033_0FB0883CC9EC3CC8"/>
when he strives with them, &amp; uses arguments to perswade them to come to Christ. Therefore their pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions that they cannot believe are vain, since they resist the moti∣ons of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. God requires one thing more, and that which they have power to do if they will, <HI>He requires that they should be earnest and diligent in the use of means for the obtaining of Faith.</HI> Joh. 6. 27. <HI>Labour for the Meat that endures to Eternal Life.</HI> And if we must labour for that, we must labour for Faith without which that is never to be obtained. Luk. 13. 24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait Gate.</HI> The gate of Faith is a strait gate, but very few enter in at it: Well, God requires men to strive that they may enter in at the strait gate. And that they should do such things as have a tendency to cause them to believe. There are such
<PB N="35" REF="001134_0034_0FB0883E661F8D50"/>
things, and sinners can practise them if they will.</P>
<P>As now,</P>
<P>Meditation and <HI>serious Consideration</HI> has a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tendency to cause men to come to Christ▪ If they would meditate on their undone conditi∣on without Christ: If they would consider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the state, the mi∣serable condition they are in, and the way they are walking in, what it is, and whether it will bring them at the last; it may be Serious Thoughts of that nature would end in their Conversion and Salvation. This they ought to do, Hag. 1. 5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts consider your wayes.</HI> The Lord God of Hosts saith from Heaven to every sinner, Consider thy wayes, what thou ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t done, whether thou art going, where this way will bring thee ere long. And God requires men to consi∣der of Death and Judgment to come. Deut. 32. 29. <HI>Oh that they were wise
<PB N="36" REF="001134_0035_0FB08846B9B56830"/>
that they would consider their latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd.</HI> This God requires of sinners, that they should sit down and con∣sider of their latter end: Consi∣der that Death is coming on them: Consider that after Death comes an Eternal Judgment. God requires sinners that they should think seri∣ously of that <HI>Eternity</HI> to which they are going: That Eternity is before them in another world where they must quickly be. Eccl. 11. 8. <HI>Re∣member the dayes of darkness for they are many.</HI> Remember <HI>Eternity,</HI> con∣sider of <HI>Eternity,</HI> and where you must be when you go out of this world. This God requires of men. And that they should <HI>Meditate on the Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> that they should think of his being a suitable Savi∣our for them: that they should Meditate on the Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, and how he is alto∣gether lovely. If they would do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, it may be their Souls would be
<PB N="37" REF="001134_0036_0FB088481ED91458"/>
enamoured with him; it may be they would be perswaded to part with all for his sake, if they would but Meditate on Jesus Christ and on his Glory. But now Sinners will not do this, altho' they can do it if they will. For that <HI>Cogi∣tative faculty,</HI> that power of think∣ing that God has given to men makes them capable to think of Christ, of Eternity, and of another World, as well as of the vain things of this world. That power which God has given them enables them to do it if they would. But they will not. They suffer other kind of thoughts to lodge in their souls, Jer. 4. 14. <HI>Wash thine heart from wickedness O Jerusalem that thou may<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st be saved: how long shall vain thoughts lodge within thee:</HI> how long shall it be? Sinners suffer vain thoughts to lodge within them, but they will not suf∣fer holy thoughts to lodge within them, they will not suffer thoughts
<PB N="38" REF="001134_0037_0FB08849C1F4A028"/>
of Christ and Eternity to lodge within them. Then shall they com∣plain they are not able to believe, when they will not do the things that have a tendency to make them believe?</P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P>God requires that men should Pray to him for Faith. For Faith is the gift of God, Eph. 2. 8. <HI>We are saved by Grace through Faith, &amp; that not of our selves it is the Gift of God.</HI> That Faith that men have if a true Faith, 'tis the gift of God to them. Faith is of the <HI>Operation of God.</HI> Then God requires &amp; ex∣pects from men that they should pray to him for this gift; that they should go alone and Cry as for their lives and souls to God to give them Faith. They say they can't come to Christ except God draw them, then you ought to <HI>Pray</HI> to God that he would draw you. Cant. 1. 3. <HI>Draw me and I shall run after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="001134_0038_0FB0884CA5510638"/>
So ought sinners to pray to God that he would draw them to Christ. He will be enquired of by the House of <HI>Israel</HI> to do this thing for them. 'Twas said to the Woman of <HI>Sama∣ria, If thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adst asked he would have given thee living water.</HI> So God expects of sinners to ask Faith in Christ. We have instances of those that prayed for Faith, Mark. 9. 24. <HI>Lord help my Unbelief.</HI> So the Lord would have sinners come before him and complain of their Unbelief, &amp; to Cry to God to help them a∣gainst their Unbelief. The Apostles prayed for more Faith, Luk. 17. 5. <HI>Lord encrease our Faith</HI> say they. So sinners should go to God and should Pray to him, <HI>Lord give us Faith,</HI> and help us to lay hold on Christ. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow our hearts to accept of him, as in the Gospel he is offered unto us. But this they will not do: Or if they do, it is in a formal careless manner, they are not in good ear∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
<PB N="40" REF="001134_0039_0FB0885394F7E798"/>
in Crying to God for Faith. Tell me if you can, where there is one Unbeliever in the world that does day and night Cry to God to help him to believe, that does Cry to God to give him saving Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. I am per∣swaded there is not one such Un∣believer in the World. Therefore how vain is it for an Unbeliever to say I cannot Believe, when he can pray to God for this Grace, but will not.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Excuse which some make it that they are Unworthy that Christ should accept of them, and therefore they will stay till they are better qua∣lified and then offer themselves to Christ.</HI> Being so unworthy as they are, they think they may Excuse them∣selves for the present.</P>
<P>But this is tho' a seemingly hum∣ble, a really proud Excuse. The meaning is that sinners would: have
<PB N="41" REF="001134_0040_0FB088576AE199A0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome works of their own to com∣mend them to the Lords acceptance, something of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir own that should deserve that Christ should receive them. Whenas we must come to Christ like poor Beggars that have nothing in the world to recommend us to him, but only Sin and Guilt and Misery, that so Christ may de∣liver us from it. Nor will he re∣fuse to accept of such if indeed they come unto him. As we read concerning <HI>David,</HI> 1 Sam. 22. 2. <HI>That if any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere in distress and in debt they came to David, and he be∣came a Captain over them.</HI> So sin∣ners that are infinitely in debt and distressed if they come to the Lord Jesus Christ he will be to them the Captain of their Salvation. There∣fore he does invite Poor as well as Rich, them▪ that have nothing to offer to him, yet that they should come to him. Isa. 55. 1. <HI>Come with∣out Money and without Price.</HI> Such
<PB N="42" REF="001134_0041_0FB0885870309BE0"/>
as are so poor as that they have neither Money nor Monies worth, the Lord sayes to them <HI>Come, come, come.</HI> And thus in this Parable, we see that Christ invites the most worthless ones to come to the great Supper, Luk. 14. 21. <HI>Go into the Lanes and Streets of the City, and bring in the Poor, the Maimed, and the Halt, and the Blind▪</HI> 23. ver. <HI>Go into the High-wayes, to the Hedges and compel them to come in.</HI> Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Salvation is altogether free, Rev. 22. 17. <HI>Whosoever will let him come and take freely of the Waters of Life.</HI> Christ will not Sell his Blood, and he will not <HI>Sell</HI> his Salvation, but he gives it <HI>freely.</HI> And as for such as have a real sense of their own Un∣wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thiness, they are not the less welcome to Christ on that account, but rather the more acceptable to him. As we see in the Centurion Mat. 8. 8. <HI>I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my Roof.</HI> The
<PB N="43" REF="001134_0042_0FB08859EE4D2258"/>
Lord did highly accept of this man that had a deep sense of his own Unworthiness. So the woman of <HI>Canaan,</HI> Christ did intimate to her that she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Dog, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Childrens Bread, Mat. 15. 26. <HI>It is not meet to cast the Childrens Bread to Dogs:</HI> Truth Lord (sayes she) <HI>but Dogs may eat of the crumbs that fall from their Masters Table.</HI> Doest thou say I am a Dog, true Lord I confess I am so, but may I not have a crumb notwithstanding that? There is no way to have any thing of real worth, but by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ for it. We must be beholden to him for it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rev. 3. 17, 18. <HI>Thou art Poor, Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ched, Naked, I counsel thee to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gold of me that thou mayest be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> If we would have Spiritual▪ Riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if we would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old, we must go unto Christ for it all.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Despairing sinners are apt to Ex∣cus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="44" REF="001134_0043_0FB088648E4EE720"/>
themselves from coming to Christ's because of the greatness of their sins.</HI> Because they have been grievous sinners they are afraid to come.</P>
<P>But this is the most unreasonable Excuse that possibly can be. It is just as if a man should say, I am ve∣ry sick, and therefore am afraid to go to the Physician. The more sin∣ful any have been, the more con∣cerned are they to go to <HI>Christ.</HI> Yea, to make ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t unto him, Mat. 9. 12, 13 <HI>The Sick need a Physician: I came to call Sinners,</HI> sayes Christ. They that have Sin-sick-souls they need a <HI>Christ,</HI> and are concerned to make ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to Him who is the great Phy∣sician of Souls, that they may be Healed. And the Lord Jesus Christ is so wonderfully, Gracious, is that He does invite the greatest of Sin∣ners. Not only such as have been guilty of lesser Evils, but the most wicked in the world where the Gos∣pel comes, <HI>Christ</HI> invites them, to
<PB N="45" REF="001134_0044_0FB08866C09D3DE8"/>
come to him, believe on him, and trust in him for Salvation, Isa. 46. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. <HI>Hearken to me you that are stou∣hearted, and that are far from Righ∣teousness.</HI> So in the Parable, Mat. 22. 10. <HI>Good &amp; Bad</HI> were invited. Not only the Good but the Bad. There are some sinners compared with others, may have the name of <HI>Good</HI> given to them. Such as have been Civil and Moral in their Conversation they are good, com∣pared with such as have been scan∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly wicked. But <HI>the Bad,</HI> the most vile profligate sinners are in∣vited to come to Him for Salvati∣on. Nor did the Lord Jesus Christ ever refuse any that came to Him, on the account of their having been gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of great sins. No, the Pub∣licans were received by Him, tho' they had been notorious Sinners. In <HI>Luk.</HI> 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7 we read of a woman <HI>that had been a sinner,</HI> an abomina∣ble sinner, yet when she did wash

the Feet of Christ with her tears, notwithstanding her great sins, He did graciously accept of her, and her sins <HI>which were many</HI> were for∣given. So then Christ does not re∣fuse any on that account. Nay as for the worst of sinners, He declares that He came into the World to save such, 1 Tim. 1. 15. <HI>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all ac∣ceptation, that Jesus Christ came to save the chief of Sinners.</HI> Then He will not refuse such as they are, if they do indeed come unto Him &amp; believe on Him. Only He expects that they should be willing to be delivered from the dominion of sin, as well as from the damnation of it. Mat. 1. 21 <HI>He saves is people from their sins</HI> And there is one consideration that may answer this and all other Excuses that can be made against believing, it is this, The God of Heaven does command men to believe, 1 Joh. 3 23 <HI>This is His commandment that ye believe in the Name of His Son Jesus
<PB N="47" REF="001134_0046_0FB088D704643CB0"/>
Christ.</HI> Would it not be a very strange thing to hear a man say, May I dare to do what the Great GOD commands me to do? For a man to say, shall I not presume if I do that which God positively requires me to do? And yet so it is when any one does say, shall I not presume if I go to Christ for Salvation, or may I dare to believe?</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Whence is it then that Sinners are so apt to Excuse and Delay their coming to Christ?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is from that Ignorance which is in them.</HI> There is a double ig∣norance which does keep men from closing with the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>First,</HI> They are ignorant of them∣selves, they know not how sinful they are. They are not sensible of that exceeding Guiltiness that is up∣on
<PB N="48" REF="001134_0047_0FB088DB07655B38"/>
on them. Especially if they have been kept from gross scandalous Sins, they are apt to think all is well with them, and that they have no such need of a Saviour as indeed they have. Thus it was with <HI>Paul</HI> before his Conversion, Rom. 7. 9 <HI>I was alive without the Law, but the Commandment came, Sin revived and I dyed.</HI> He thought himself a∣live, that he was in the way unto Eternal Life. Before his Conver∣sion he lived very blamele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, he was a Pharisee and a strict one too. But when the <HI>Commandment,</HI> when the <HI>Law</HI> was set home on his Conscience in the power and spiri∣tual Nature of it, then he saw him∣self a thousand times more guilty and sinful than once he apprehended. Then <HI>I Dyed,</HI> (sayes he) he saw himself a Dead and and a Damned Creature, and was e'ne ready to dye away with the terrible sight of his sins. And Sinners are ignorant
<PB N="49" REF="001134_0048_0FB088DC733F79F0"/>
of their Misery, Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 17. <HI>Thou knowest not that thou art Miserable.</HI> A man that is very sick if he does not know it, he will not go to the Physician. So it is with sinners, Mat. 9. 12. <HI>The whole have no need of a Physician.</HI> The Pharisees thought themselves to be whole, and righte∣ous enough without a Christ, and therefore they came not to him, Joh. 9. 41. <HI>You say we see, therefore your Sin remains</HI> They were under Spiritual blindness and other mi∣series, which they needed a Christ to save them from, but they knew it not; therefore their sin did re∣main.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Sinners are ignorant of Christ, therefore they come not to him, Joh. 1, 10, 11. <HI>He was in the world and the world knew him not; He came to his own and they received him not.</HI> They knew him not, and therefore received him not. If a
<PB N="50" REF="001134_0049_0FB088DE0DC98A80"/>
man should have a Jewel offered to him of never so great value, if he is ignorant of its worth, he will not much regard the offer. So here, Christ is the most precious Jewel that ever was offered to any man, He is better than <HI>Rubies:</HI> But sin∣ners don't know the worth of a Christ, if they did they would not reject him, but count it the greatest happiness might they have an interest in him. Psal. 9. 10 <HI>They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee.</HI> They that know the worth of a Christ will believe on him. It was therefore said to the woman of <HI>Sa∣maria,</HI> Joh. 4. 10 <HI>If thou hadst known the gift of God, thou wouldest have ask∣ed.</HI> But as long as sinners do not know Christ, it is not to be wondred at if they do not come to him for Salvation. The man that was born blind but had his eyes opened, when 'twas said to him, Joh. 9. 35. <HI>Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</HI> Re∣plyed,
<PB N="51" REF="001134_0050_0FB088E30514A8C0"/>
<HI>Who is He that I may believe on him?</HI> If men do not know who and what manner of one Christ is, they will not believe on him. Sin∣ners are ignorant of the Righteous∣ness of Christ, and therefore do not desire to be made partakers of it.

him, 1 Cor. 2. 8 <HI>If they had known Him they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Reason why sinners do not come to Christ when invited, <HI>It is because they love him not.</HI> No man will choose to be a Scholar to a Master that he hates. Sinners are so far from loving the Lord Je∣sus Christ, as that they do indeed hate him. Joh. 3. 20 <HI>He that hates the light does not come to the light.</HI> Christ is that light which sinners hate, therefore they do not nor will come unto him. It is a sad word to be spoken, but alas a true one, <HI>That men by Nature are haters of God,</HI> and therefore will not believe on him who is the Son of God. This reason Christ gives why the <HI>Jews</HI> did not believe on him, Joh. 5. 42. <HI>You will not come unto me that ye may have life: You have not the love of God in you.</HI> They hated God &amp;
<PB N="53" REF="001134_0052_0FB088E56529D310"/>
therefore would not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ. He that hates God the Father, hates the Lord Je∣sus Christ who is the Son of God also, and must needs do so because he is so like unto his Father. Joh▪ 15. 24. <HI>They have hated me and my Father,</HI> sayes Christ. He that hates the one will hate the other. He that hates Christ will hate God even the Father, and he that hates God the Father will hate Jesus Christ too. Wherefore Christ speaking concern∣ing those <HI>Jews</HI> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were invited to come to him, but did not, nor would they come, sayes <HI>Their Soul loathed me, Zech.</HI> 11. 8. Because Christ is holy therefore the unholy hearts of men do not love him. As the E∣vil Spirit once said in a po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed Man, <HI>What have we to do with thee thou holy one of God?</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 1. 24. So it is with sinners, Christ is the Holy one of God, &amp; therefore they don't desire to have to do with him.
<PB N="54" REF="001134_0053_0FB088EC4C6D2ED0"/>
He is too holy for them. They would willingly have a Christ that should save them from Hell and yet allow them to live in their sins: such a Christ would please them. But Christ is <HI>He who is Holy,</HI> and will not allow men to continue sin∣ning against God. Hence they hate him, Joh 7. 7. <HI>The world hates me</HI> (sayes Christ) <HI>because I testify of it that the works of it are evil:</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Sinners Excuse &amp; Delay their coming to Christ <HI>because their hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set upon those things which are in∣consistent with Believing and Accept∣ing him according to the terms of the Gospel.</HI> Three things the Gospel requires men to part withal▪ but their Hearts are set on them and they will not let them go.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is their own Righteousness, men must be willing to renounce that.</HI> Mat. 16. 24. <HI>If a man will be my

Disciple he must deny himself.</HI> He must deny his Natural self and his <HI>Righteous self,</HI> which is the hardest piece of self-denyal in the world. They that think it is not so, do not know what it is to deny Righteous self. <HI>Adam</HI> was to have been sa∣ved by a Righteousness of his own, and all his Children desire to be saved in the same way. Isa. 57. 10 <HI>Thou hast found the life in thy hands.</HI> Thats what men exceedingly de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, they would have life by their own hands; they would obtain Eternal Life by some Works or Righteous∣ness of their own. Sinners are loth to go a begging to Christ, to be beholden to another for life and for salvation their proud hearts cannot comply with that. They would rather with some works of their own purchase Salvation. A Learned Papist (but a Prou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one) said, <HI>If God would give him Heaven</HI> Gratis <HI>he would not accept of it on
<PB N="56" REF="001134_0055_0FB088EF34DB5388"/>
those terms.</HI> He would do something that should deserve it first. To be saved by ones own Righteousness &amp; by the Righteousness of Christ are inconsistent, they stand in direct op∣position the one to the other. Men doate on their own Righteousness, they Idolize that, therefore will not come to Christ for his, Rom. 10. 3. <HI>Going about to establish their own Righteousness they submitted not to the Righteousness of God.</HI> That then keeps them from coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, and closing with him as offered in the Gospel.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>The Hearts of men are exceed∣ingly set on the World: therefore it is that they refuse the invitations of the Gospel.</HI> Thus <HI>Mat.</HI> 22. 5 when they were invited to the great Supper, <HI>one went to his Farm, and another to his Merchandise,</HI> and made light of that invitation. Wherefore is it that men make light of the Gospel
<PB N="57" REF="001134_0056_0FB088F32F831DD0"/>
offer? It is because the Farm or Merchandise has their hearts. If they could have Christ &amp; the world too, it would please them. If they were sure of gaining the world by coming to Christ, they would say as a famous Pagan once did, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me a good rich Bishoprick and I will turn Christian.</HI> But Christ promises nothing of that Nature, but the con∣trary, and sayes, If any will come to him and be his Disciples, they must look for Poverty, Crosses and Afflictions in the world. And that if they do any service for him, or suffer for his sake, they must look for their Recompence not in this, but in another World. Now when they heir of this, they fly off from CHRIST, and don't care to come to him on such terms as these are. One made a very fair profes∣sion, <HI>Lord</HI> (sayes he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to Christ) <HI>I will follow thee whither soever thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Mat. 8▪ 19. Sayes Christ to him,
<PB N="58" REF="001134_0057_0FB088F931A9A750"/>
<HI>The Son of Man ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not where to lay his head.</HI> If thou wilt follow me, it may be thou shalt not have an House to put thine head in, but must be a poor man all thy dayes. Then you hear no more of him. Another came to Christ praying an Answer to the greatest Case of Conscience that could be pro∣pounded, Namely, <HI>What he must do to obtain Eternal Life?</HI> Christ to try the man, bid him sell all that he had, and give to the Poor, and tells him he should have Treasures in Heaven. But 'tis said, Mat. 19. 22 <HI>He went away sorrowful for he had great Possessions.</HI> Those possessions kept him from closing with Christ on the terms of the Gospel. If men are resolved to have the World whatever comes on it, they will not come to Christ. If a man is resolved that he will have worldly Honours, 'tis impossible he should be a Believer on Christ, Joh. 5. 44.
<PB N="59" REF="001134_0058_0FB088FA93B3A7C8"/>
<HI>How can you Believe that receive Honour one from another?</HI> So if men be resolved to have the Riches and Pleasures of the Earth, then they will not come to Christ; No, they remain in a state of Enmity against Him, Jam. 4. 4. <HI>Do ye not know that the Friendship of the world is Enmity a∣gainst God, and that if a man be a Friend of the world, he will be an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God.</HI> So then he remains an Enemy of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Hearts of men are set upon their sins.</HI> They love Sin, they take pleasure in Unrighteousness: There are sinners that take delight in no∣thing so much as in sinning against the blessed God. Prov. 4. 16 <HI>They can't sleep except they cause some to fall.</HI> They are set upon sinning, and causing others to sin. Now Christ sayes, if they come to Him they must be willing to part with all their sins. He sayes away with your sins
<PB N="60" REF="001134_0059_0FB088FBE52CEC08"/>
forever, if you come to me for Sal∣vation. Ezek 18. 31 <HI>Cast away your Transgressions, why will you die?</HI> So does Christ say, Part with your sins, or else you will die, Mat. 5. 29. <HI>Pluck out thy right Eye, Cut off thy right Hand if it does offend thee.</HI> The sins of men are as dear to them as life or limbs, or what is most dear. Many a man that has a pleasurable lust he is accustomed to and he had as liev have his Right Eye plucked out as to be divorced from that Lust. A vile Drunkard was per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>waded to leave his Drunken∣ness for fear of losing his eyes, he replyed, I had rather part with my Eyes than not be Drunk sometimes. Thus are sinners in love &amp; in league with their sins, and therefore they will not come to Christ to be de∣livered from them.</P>

Jesus Christ.</HI> He hates Christ with an implacable hatred. The Serpent hates the seed of the Woman more than any thing in the world. He knowes that Christ has wounded him to death, having destroyed his King∣dom, and bruised his Head, and therefore he hates Him, 1 Joh. 3 8 <HI>For this purpose wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Son of God manifested to destroy the works o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Devil.</HI> Sin and Death are the works of the Devil.

to betray Christ. So he puts it in∣to the hearts of sinners to take up Prejudices against believing on Christ. And sometimes he does it by wicked Instruments. When <HI>Paul</HI> Preached the Gospel to <HI>Sergius</HI> the Deputy, <HI>Elimas</HI> sought to turn him from the Faith, Act. 13. 10 said the Apostle, <HI>Thou Child of the Devil, will you not cease to pervert the right wayes of the Lord.</HI> It was from the Devil. And the truth is, the Devil had rather men should do any thing in the world, than they should believe in Jesus Christ. It is true, he would not have men to Pray, to observe the Sabbath, to reform their Evil wayes, yet he had rather they should do all this, than go to Christ. It is a thing known that the Devil has in Humane shape appeared to men, and (to serve a Cursed design) given them good Counsel. In this Land a <HI>Daemon</HI> appeared to an <HI>Indian,</HI> and advised him to leave off Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nken∣ness,
<PB N="63" REF="001134_0062_0FB08906896EF290"/>
to Pray to God, hear Sermons, and observe the Sabbath Day: The Indian did so, and continued to do thus for several Years. At last the <HI>Daemon</HI> advised him to kill himself, and told him he should rise again within three dayes. The miserable wretch did kill himself, and so was ruined Body and Soul. But it was observed that this <HI>Demon</HI> said not one word of Christ to him▪ never exhorted him to believe in the Name of Jesus Christ. The Devil knows that the Salvation of men depends on this thing above all others; that if they believe in <HI>Christ</HI> they shall have Eternal Life. But he knows also that tho' they Hear, Pray, and keep the Sabbath, if they do not believe on <HI>Christ</HI> they never will be saved. Therefore above all things, Satan sets himself to hinder men from believing on, and coming to Christ for Life and Salvation.</P>

But Oh that you would be perswaded to come to him without any further delays. Your past neglects of Christ, and of the great Salvation may suffice you. Let not any one say, I'll stay until I am sick and like to dye, and then I'll believe and give my self to Christ. Have you not heard of a poor Man that did so, and when he lay on his Death-bed a Mi∣nister said to him, There is no way left for you to obtain Salvation but by going to Christ. <HI>Oh</HI> said he <HI>when I was well and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l would not go to Christ, now I am sick and dy∣ing I cannot go.</HI> Oh remember the avenger of Blood is behind you.

<P>IN the former part of this Chapter we have the <HI>History</HI> of the two <HI>first</HI> Mon that ever were Born into the World, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Can</HI> and <HI>Abel. Abel</HI> the Younger

the Devil▪ As we see in the words be∣fore us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e insisted on Which some take to be words of Complaint and Murmuring against God, saying that his Punishment was greater than he deserved. But others take the words to be words of <HI>Despair.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word <HI>Nasa</HI> translated to <HI>Bear,</HI> signifies also to <HI>Forgive.</HI> And according to the Seventy Greek in∣terpreters they run thus, <HI>My Fault is greater than it can be forgiven to me.</HI> My Sin (sayes he) is so great that God Himself can't never for∣give it. And in so saying he did exceedingly sin. One of the An∣cients observes, that <HI>Cain</HI> in saying that his Iniquity was greater than could be forgiven, was guilty of a greater sin than when he mur∣dered his own Brother. It was surely an heinous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n in him.</P>
<P>Wherefore the DOCTRINE be∣fore us, is,
<PB N="82" REF="001134_0081_0FB0894DB32CFF78"/>
<HI>That for Men to Despair of Forgive∣ness because their Iniquities have been Great, is a great Evil.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearing of the Truth before us.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Something may be men∣tioned for the Demonstration of it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We shall enquire whe∣ther such as belong to God may not fall into the sin of Despair?</P>
<P>For the Demonstration of the Doctrine now to be insisted on.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is evident in that in Despair there is a Blasphemous Reflection on the Glorious Name of God.</HI> It is a disowning and a denying of his Glo∣rio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Attributes. It is a denying of his Omnipotency. God can do every thing; the doing whereof does argue or require power. And in the forgiveness of sin power is
<PB N="83" REF="001134_0082_0FB0894F31C36140"/>
required. Therefore when <HI>Moses</HI> prayed for the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> that their sin might be forgiven them, he said, Numb. 14. 17. <HI>Let the Power of my Lard be great. q. d.</HI> The greatness of thy power is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hewn in forgiving great Sins. But Despair makes the Omnipotent God to be no better than Impotent sinful Men. To forgive sin is an act of Omnipotent Goodness. Despair robs God of this Glory. Men are apt to judge of God by themselves. Because they are not able to for∣give very great wrongs, they are apt to think that God can't do so neither: but this the Lord reproves, Isa. 55. 8, 9. <HI>My wayes are not as your wayes, but as the Heavens are higher than the Earth so are my wayes higher than your wayes.</HI> I'll forgive great injuries to my Name, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord, tho' you can't do the like: you may not judge of me by your selves, who can't forgive such
<PB N="84" REF="001134_0083_0FB08950A4CC8070"/>
offences: But my wayes are above yours. Thus to speak concerning God, thus to deny his Omnipotent Power, is to speak against him, it is to blaspheme his Name, Psal. 78. 19. <HI>They spake against God saying, can God prepare a Table?</HI> So when any say, Can God forgive so great a Sinner? Can God pardon so great Sins as mine are? This is to speak against Him. Again, Despair is di∣rectly against the Grace and Mercy of God. In which Attributes his Divine Glory does most eminently shine forth. When God proclaim∣ed his Name before <HI>Moses, Exod</HI> 34. 6, 7 He said, <HI>I am the Lord, Gracious and Merciful, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g-suffering, abundant in Goodness and Truth, keep∣ing Mercy for Thousands, forgiving Iniquity, Transgression and Sin.</HI> Some have observed that in the Procla∣mation of Gods Name, there are no less than thirteen Attributes men∣tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="85" REF="001134_0084_0FB089546FA85528"/>
which relate to his Mercy, and only one to his Justice. God counts that especially as his Glory, Epe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1. 12. <HI>That we may be to the Praise of his Glory.</HI> His Grace his Mercy is his Glory. Now by De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pair men leave to God but a little of this Glory. They limit the Mer∣cy of God. To limit God is a great Evil. Psal▪ 78. 41. <HI>They limited the Holy One of Israel.</HI> To limit his Power or his Mercy is a great Evil. Yet so do they that Despair. They set bounds to the infinite Mercy of God. They say there is but a lit∣tle Mercy in God: Only Mercy e∣nough to pardon lesser sins, but not the greatest. Men thereby say there is more of Evil in a finite Creature, than there is of Goodness in the Infinite God: than which blasphemy nothing more untrue can be spoken. Rom. 5. 20. <HI>Where Sin abounds Grace much more abound.</HI> But Despair sayes, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> does abound more than
<PB N="86" REF="001134_0085_0FB089576A89FFD8"/>
the Grace of God. Yea and in this sin, there is a blasphemous re∣flection on the Truth of God as well as on his Power and Mercy, as if there were no. Truth in those gracious Promises which God hath made un∣to repenting believing Sinners. God in his Word has said that the great∣est sinners in the world, if they will truly repent and turn to him shall be forgiven, Isa. 1. 18. <HI>Wash you make you clean, cease to do evil, learn to do well, though your sins be as Scarlet they shall become white as Snow, then red like Crimson, they shall be a Wool.</HI> God sayes that the horride<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> bloodiest Sinners in the world shall have a full forgiveness of all their sins if they turn to him. But Despair sayes, that is not true. God in his Word sayes, they that have been guilty of many sins as well as great ones, if they do truly repent and turn to God in Jesus Christ, shall have their many sins
<PB N="87" REF="001134_0086_0FB08958F84CD398"/>
forgiven to them. Isa. 55. 7. <HI>Let the Wicked forsake his war, and the Unrighteous man his thoughts, and re∣turn to the Lord, he will have mercy, to our God and he will abundantly par∣don.</HI> He will multiply to pardon. They that have been guilty of ma∣ny sins shall find there are more Pardons with God to bestow on them, than they have committed sins. And they that have committed the same sins many Times over, yet God, sayes in his Word, if they will repent and believe on Jesus Christ they shall be forgiven. A Drunkard that has been Drunk an hundred times and more. An Un∣clean person that has been guilty many a time, if he repents God will forgive him. Jer. 3. 1. <HI>Tho' thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st played the Harl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with many Lo∣vers, yet Return.</HI> Yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd He has promised that they who have been guilty of grievous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that have returned to those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which for
<PB N="88" REF="001134_0087_0FB0895A64CDB508"/>
a time they had forsaken, upon true Repentance after all shall be Pardon∣ed Jer. 3. 12. <HI>Return ye Back∣sliding Children, and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you.</HI> Now Despair sayes, there is no truth in these Promises. It is then a great Evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In Despair there is a great re∣flection on Jesus Christ the Son of God and Saviour of the World.</HI> It sayes Jesus Christ is but a little Saviour, whereas He is a Saviour, and a Great one, Isa. 63. 1. <HI>He is mighty to save.</HI> Despair sayes of Christ that He is a Physician that can cure only lesser diseases and not the great∣est Whereas he is able to cure the most Diseased Soul in the world. As no Bodily Disease could stand before his power, Mat. 4. 23. <HI>He healed all manner of Sicknesses, and all manner of Diseases.</HI> That was to signify that he Healeth all manner of Soul Diseases: And that he has
<PB N="89" REF="001134_0088_0FB0896244DA3000"/>
obtain'd Forgiveness for all manner of Sins that men are guilty of. We find in the Gospel, some diseased Twelve, others Eighteen, others Thirty Eight Years, yet Christ did heal them; thereby declaring, that Souls which have been a long time under the Guilt of sin may through him hope for Forgiveness. And that the most Chronical, the most laveterate Soul-diseases may be and shall be healed by him. But Despair sayes otherwise. Heb. 7. 25. <HI>He is able to save to the uttermost.</HI> No, sayes Despair but he is not. Tho' a Sinner has destroyed himself to the uttermost; though he has damn'd his own Soul a Million times over, yet <HI>Christ</HI> is able to save him. Des∣pair then is a reflection on the Me∣rit of the Death and Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> as though that Blood could make atonement for lesser offences, but not for great ones: Whereas the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ the
<PB N="90" REF="001134_0089_0FB08963837CE220"/>
Son of God, cleanseth from all sin, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 7. Let the sins be never so many, never so great, that Blood cleanseth from them all. There is more of Merit in the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, than there has been of Demerit in the greatest Sin that ever was committed in the world. <HI>Adams</HI> sin was in some respects the greatest that ever was, for that has brought ruine on thou∣sands of millions of Immortal Souls, yet the Merit of the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> has exceeded the Demerit of that great Offence Rom. 5▪ 17. <HI>If by one Death came, how much more shall they that receive abundance of Grace, &amp; the gift of Righteousness reign in Life, by Jesus Christ.</HI> Much more sayes the Apostle. The Disobedience of <HI>Adam</HI> destroyed Souls, much more does the Obedience of Christ save the Souls that believe on him. God has been pleased more, and honoured more by the Death of Christ, than
<PB N="91" REF="001134_0090_0FB08964ED58CB90"/>
he has been displeased and disho∣noured by all the sins of all the Men in the world. But Despair de∣nies this. And it reflects on the Veracity of <HI>Christ,</HI> as tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pro∣mised more than he either would or could perform. Christ sayes, who∣ever comes to him He will accept of them and save them, Joh▪ 6. 37. <HI>Him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.</HI> But the Despairing▪ sinner sayes, though I should go to Christ he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me out. So then 'tis a great Evil.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Despair proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d▪ from Evil Cau∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> That▪s another thing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets forth the Evil of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It proceeds from Satan.</HI> 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that makes men Despair. Pre∣sumption and Despair both proceed from the Devil. <HI>First</HI> he Tempts sinners to commit very great sins, and when they have done so, then he tells them their sin is greater
<PB N="92" REF="001134_0091_0FB08967B54A97E8"/>
than can be forgiven. Thus in <HI>Cain,</HI> the Wicked one perswaded him to murder his Brother, and when he had done so, he told him that now his Sin was so great, as that it was Unpardonable. Who is it that says to sinners, their sins are greater than can be forgiven? God does not say so. And Ungodly sinners tho' they are wont to tempt one another to Presumptuous sins, yet they don't use to tempt one another to Despair. It remains then that it is Satan which tempts persons to Desperation. So he tells sinners it is too soon to Repent, and when they have delay'd their Repentance for a long time, then if they begin to have a serious thought of turn∣ing to God, he sayes now it is too late. First that it was too soon, &amp; then that 'tis too late. This he does that so he may discourage from Returning to God, and from Pray∣ing for Pardoning mercy.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="93" REF="001134_0092_0FB08969CA324678"/>2. <HI>Despair proceeds from groundless and sinful Fears.</HI> Especially there are three things which Despairing Sinners are afraid of, without any just ground.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Lest the Day of Grace is past with them.</HI> But why should any say so, or think so? Sayes the Lord, Isa. 40, 27. <HI>Why sayest thou O Jacob? Why speakest thou O Israel, my judg∣ment is passed over from my God?</HI> Why should any one say the Day of Grace is past? God will look on me no more! Whereas there is not any one here this day, that can say that his Revealed Day of Grace is gone and passed away. As for the Secret Inward Day of Grace that continues so long as the Holy Spirit strives with the Soul. Such fears as these not amounting to Des∣pair oftentimes are attended with the strivings of the Holy Spirit of God. Hence the Apostle speaks of <HI>the Spirit of Bondage to Fear, Rom.</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="001134_0093_0FB089709D82B7D0"/>
8. 15. Poor sinful Creatures are in great Bondage, because they are full of Fear. God sanctifies such Fears to his Elect, in order to their Conversion. As for the Revealed Day of Grace, that continues so long as men enjoy the Outward means of Grace, and have the Gos∣pel Preached to them, which is the Gospel of the Grace of God. Isa. 65. 2. <HI>I have stretched out my hand all the day long.</HI> There is no man that lives under the Gospel, but God offers to him the Pardon of his Sins, and the Salvation of his Soul, if he will indeed believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. And unto such the Revealed Day of Grace continues so long as the Day of Life Indeed after Life is ended, the Day of Grace is at an end. No more Sermons, no more tenders of Mercy, no more calls to Repen∣tance after that. Therefore Des∣peration must needs be in such mi∣serable
<PB N="95" REF="001134_0094_0FB08971B4A0BB88"/>
Souls as dye in their sins, Isa. 38. 18. <HI>They that go down to the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth.</HI> But while Life lasts there is hope, Eccl. 9. 4 <HI>To him that is joyned to the living there is hope.</HI> Hope that he may obtain the forgiveness of Sin, and the Eternal salvation of his Soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Despairing Sinners are afraid that God from all Eternity has Re∣probated them to Damnation.</HI> But who is this that darkens Counsel by words without Knowledge? Who told thee that thou art a Re∣probate? God never told thee so. It must needs be Satan then, and will you believe him? Learned <HI>Bezn</HI> wrote a Judicious Treatise, con∣cerning Divine Reprobation. It so happened that a man who read that Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself a Re∣probate, fell into Despair, and de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>royed himself. And thereupon Popish writers, and some others
<PB N="96" REF="001134_0095_0FB0897324AC90A8"/>
have taken occasion to blaspheme the Doctrine of Reprobation, as if it tended to drive men to Despair. But there is no cause for that <HI>Pre∣destination</HI> is a Divine secret, known to no Man or Angel, to none but God alone. Therefore for men to conclude that they are Reproba∣ted is an high offence to God, Rom. 11. 34 <HI>Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Coun∣sellor?</HI> Who was by him when he wrote the Book of Life, to see whose Names were enrolled there, and whose left out? As God said to <HI>Job,</HI> Job, 38. 17 <HI>Have the gates of Death been opened to thee, or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of Death?</HI> So has the Book of Death been opened to thee, that thou shouldest know who are appointed to Wrath, and not unto Salvation? No, it has not For any man to say that another is a Reprobate would be a great sin. But for him
<PB N="97" REF="001134_0096_0FB0897AE5A4CB88"/>
to say that he himself is so, would be a greater sin. A man may know his <HI>Election</HI> by giving diligence to make his Calling sure. If he know that he is Effectually Called, he may be assured of his Election. But no man can know his Reprobation, ex∣cept in one case which is rare, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> if he hath committed the Unpar∣donable Sin.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another groundless Fear which is the cause of Despair in some, is that they have been guilty of the Sin a∣gainst the Holy Ghost, which shall ne∣ver be forgiven neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.</HI> But that is a groundless Fear in any one that has any fear about it. There are many that are perplexed left they have been guilty of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, of whom it is certain that they never did, nor never shall commit that sin. Many pious Souls especially when in the
<PB N="98" REF="001134_0097_0FB0897C44B6B5F8"/>
Pangs of the New-birth, are thus Tempted. Young Converts are fre∣quently disturbed with fears of that nature. But the reason of it is they are ignorant of the nature of that Sin. The sin against the Holy Ghost is a knowing and melicio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s blas∣pheming the operations of the Ho∣ly Spirit of God. Whoever has been guilty of that sin, has mali∣ciously blasphemed that which in his Conscience he did believe was the work of Gods Spirit. There is cause to conclude that the Pha∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees were some of them guilty of that sin. When the Lord Jesus Christ did by the power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ho∣ly Spirit of God cast out Devils, the Pharisees blasphemously said He did it by the Devil. They knew in their Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sciences, they were fully convinced of it, that▪ what Christ did was by the Holy Spirit, yet they most maliciously said, it was by the Devil. On that occasion
<PB N="99" REF="001134_0098_0FB0897DA7BF81B0"/>
Christ said, that the Blasphemy a∣gainst the Holy Ghost should never be forgiven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 32. But con∣sider the Characters of those that have been guilty of the Unpar∣donable Sin, and then say whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been guilty of it or no.</P>
<P>One Character of such a person is, that he has an implacable Hatred of the Holy Lord Jesus Christ. Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6. <HI>They can't be renewed by Re∣pentance, for they have Crucified the Son of God afresh.</HI> They that have committed the Unpardonable sin, if it were possible for them to do it, they would Crucify the Son of God again. They contemn the Doctrine of Salvation by the Blood of Christ. <HI>They trample under foot the Son of God, and count the Blood of the Covenant an unholy thing. Heb.</HI> 10. 29.</P>
<P>Again, Such as have been guilty of this sin are bitter Persecutors of those that have the image of God
<PB N="100" REF="001134_0099_0FB0899A76C11AE8."/>
appearing in them. It has been thought by Divines, that <HI>Saul</HI> was guilty of the great Transgression. Now he had a most bitter hatred of those that did in a peculiar manner belong to God. 1 Sam. 22. 17. <HI>Slay the Priests of the Lord.</HI> They are the Lords Priests therefore Slay them. He therein shewed his spite against God, who had preferred <HI>David</HI> a∣bove him. So it is with those that commit the Unpardonable sin. They can't come at God, and therefore will shew all the spite they can a∣gainst his Faithful Servants.</P>
<P>Two things I may venture to say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They that are afraid lest they have committed the Sin against the Holy Ghost, it is certain they never did commit it.</HI> If they had they would never be troubled on that acount: For it would be matter of pleasure to them; as it is with the Devil: All manner of sin is pleasant to
<PB N="101" REF="001134_0100_0FB08997E5144B58"/>
him. The Devil is not troubled that he has been guilty of any one sin. So they that have committed the Sin against the Holy Ghost are not sorry for what they have done. And I may venture to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there is not one here in this Assembly that has been guilty of that Sin.</HI> For if you had, you would not be here attending on the Word of God. They that commit that sin do as, Heb. 10. 25 <HI>Forsake the assembly of the Saints.</HI> They then that do attend the Assemblies of Gods People, that prize his Ordi∣nances, that hear the Word of his Gospel with delight, have not been left to that sin. So then that is a groundless Fear.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Not only Elect Vessels, but true Be∣lievers may for a time be overcome with this Evil.</HI> What are men, yea the best of men, if God withdraw from them, and leave them to the power of Satans Temptations? There have been very Holy Men &amp; Women who have had their pangs of Despair. For such may be of melancholy tempers, and thence apt without any just ground, to phan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y dismal things concerning themselves. There was an eminent Minister in <HI>London,</HI> (Mr. <HI>Nalton</HI>) who in some fits of melancholy would say, <HI>If an Angel should come from Heaven and tell him that he had Grace, he could not believe him.</HI> An Aged &amp; Faith∣ful Minister here in <HI>New-England,</HI> being overcome with melancholy, did many Years ago utter such words
<PB N="106" REF="001134_0105_0FB089A6260696B0"/>
as these to me, <HI>O it is a sad thing when a man knows that he must be Damned. I have your Father more than any man in the world: He came to see me, and would have Prayed with me, but I would not permit him to do it lest he should take Gods Name in vain by Praying for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Thus a Natural Disease is through the malice of Satan the cause of this Spiritual Malady. And then it is often removed by the use of natural means. The <HI>Physician</HI> may do more than the <HI>Divine</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for relief in this case. Moreover, Good men may be in a Despairing condition through a mistaken Judgment Some very pious Souls have been troubled with horrid <HI>Blash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emous Thoughts</HI> concerning God, and Christ, and the Holy Scriptures; and Satan has from thence taken occasion to fill them with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thoughts</HI> too. They have fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly imagined that no one that belongs to God could be
<PB N="107" REF="001134_0106_0FB089A7C5EDC2E0"/>
troubled with such thoughts: Where∣as the greatest Saints on Earth may be vexed with them. What more blasphemous imagination can there be than that a Man should worship the Devil? Nevertheless, the Devil did suggest that to the Holy mind of Christ in whom there never was any sin. Such blasphemous thoughts if they are not at all entertained, but rejected with abhorrency, are the Devils sin, and not the sins, only the great affliction of the man that is perplexed with them. When <HI>Josephs</HI> Steward put his Silver Cup into <HI>Benjamins</HI> Sack, there was no guilt on <HI>Benjamin</HI> who never con∣sented to the Theft. No more are they guilty of sin whose minds are perplex∣ed with blasphemous injections from Satan, as long as they give no con∣sent to them. It is not the ra∣vished party, but the party whose will consented to the rape that is guilty. They that Cry out to Hea∣ven

<P><HI>For the most part when Gods Chil∣dren fall into the Sin of Despair, they are graciously revived and comforted before they go out of the world.</HI> The holy Penman of the <HI>Seventy Seventh</HI> Psalm had his dark hours.

<PB N="109" REF="001134_0108_0FB089B26789EAF0"/>
There have been very eminent Saints who having fallen into the pit of Despair, have not dyed there. The holy Martyr Mr. <HI>Robert Glover,</HI> a little before his death was much sunk in his spirit. But when he came to behold the Stake where he must dye, he was e'ne ravished with joy, saying, <HI>He is come, He is come,</HI> the Comforter is come to my soul. That Martyrs Brother Mr. <HI>John Glover,</HI> had been in a sad Despairing condition a long time, fearing (without cause) that he had committed the Unpardona∣ble sin. But some Years before his death the Lord restor'd Comforts to him, and he lived a most Cele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti∣al life, more like an Angel than like an Earthly Man, spending the most of his Time in Communion with God. There was in <HI>Oxford</HI> a Learned and Holy Minister (Mr. <HI>Peacock</HI>) who thought himself a Re∣probate, and that Prayer for him
<PB N="110" REF="001134_0109_0FB089B3B62BD7F8"/>
would in vain. But he dyed tri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly with such words as these in his mouth, <HI>I am sure the Lord has provided for me a Kingdom, the Joy that I feel it incredible. I am a thousand times happy.</HI> That Emi∣nently Religious Gentle-woman, Mrs. <HI>Katherine Brettergh</HI> had a fit of Despair, in which she would with tears trickling down her Cheeks, cry out that she was a woful for∣saken Woman, having a roring Wilderness of wo within her, wish∣ing she had never been Born, or that she had been any other Crea∣ture, rather than such an one. But this Agony of that Eminent Saint, who had been a great blessing to many, ended in Joy unspeakable &amp; full of Glory. For she dyed with such words as these; <HI>And now blessed Lord! Thy comfortable Presence is come: Yea Lord, thou hast had respect to thy Hand-maid, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come with fulness of Joy, and abundance of Con∣solations.

Never∣theless▪ One Example more I shall mention which his of later Date. Mr. <HI>Charles L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> was in grievous Horror and Despair for some Years. But God wonderfully brought him out of his distresses, and that in Answer to the Prayers of his Wife, who was a praying holy Woman. This man hapned to over hear her at her secret Devotions, where she expressed her self after this manner, <HI>Oh my Father, my Father what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P><HI>It is possible that a Godly man may dye under a Cloud.</HI> We must not judge of men by their last hours, but by the former course of their lives. As some Ungodly Hypocrites

Our Learned <HI>Cartwright</HI> observes that <HI>many a Sinner has gone to Hell with a Lord have mercy in his mouth:</HI> So have they with an ungrounded perswasion of their finding mercy. From thence it is that some Un∣godly persons are not afraid of death, pretending to an assurance of Hea∣ven. So on the other hand, Gra∣cious Souls may live and dye under great Fears what will become of them after death. A great Casuist speaks after this manner, <HI>The com∣mon Opinion</HI> (sayes he) <HI>is, that if a man Dy quietly and go away like a Lamb, then he goes straight to Hea∣ven, but if the violence of the Disease
<PB N="114" REF="001134_0113_0FB089C1E4EB9578"/>
cause frantick behaviours, then men use to say there is a Judgment of God, serving either to discover an Hypo∣crite, or to plague a Wicked man. But the truth is otherwise. For indeed a man may dye like a Lamb, and yet go to Hell. And one that dies in exceeding Torments and strange behaviour of the Body, may go to Heaven.</HI> Thus speaks our famous Mr. <HI>Perkins.</HI> And how often has it been seen that men of the greatest Holiness have gone out of the world tho' with inward tranquility of Soul, yet not with <HI>Ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tasies</HI> of joy. That Heavenly Saint, Mr. <HI>Paul Bain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> when dying had not any transports of Joy.

Now then concerning the present case, I say with that Eminent Divine Mr. <HI>Bolton,</HI> that for my part, I
<PB N="115" REF="001134_0114_0FB089C38935FC88"/>
would not much alter my Censure of a mans spiritual estate whom I have throughly known before for the manner of his death Hear (sayes he) that great Doctor, (he intends Mr. <HI>Greenham</HI>) in the Art of rightly comforting afflicted Con∣sciences, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut what if you should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay in this discomfort?

<P>We proceed now to the APPLI∣CATION of the Doctrine, only by way of <HI>Exhortation.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="116" REF="001134_0115_0FB089CC1F02E760"/>I. <HI>Let every one say to his Soul as</HI> David <HI>did to his,</HI> Psal. 43. 11. <HI>O my Soul hope thou in God.</HI> There are those in this Assembly, that are in Distresses, the Lord knows how many are perplexed in their Souls, and full of fears and doubts, well but Despair not however: But rather go to God and say to him, as his People of old did, Jer. 14. 8. <HI>O thou that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Hope of</HI> Israel, <HI>and the Saviour thereof in the time of Trouble, leave me not.</HI> Go and Cry to God, and yet Hope in him. Hope is a Grace exceeding necessary for a Christian, as an Hel∣met is for a Souldier. Eph. 6. 17. <HI>Put on the Helmet of Salvation.</HI> What is that? Hope in God and the Lord Jesus Christ, that is the Helmet of Salvation; 'tis the Head-piece. If a man be wounded in the head, it is dangerous. If a Christian lets his Hope go, his Head lyes open to the
<PB N="117" REF="001134_0116_0FB089CDF052F4D8"/>
Wicked one, to the fiery Darts of the Wicked one. And those fiery Darts are evil Thoughts concerning God. The Devil puts it into a Christians heart that God will ne∣ver have mercy on him, that God has Reprobated him. Now his Head piece is gone if he gives way to these Temptations. Hope is as necessary as an Anchor to a Vessel. Heb. 6. 18, 19. <HI>Who are fled for Refuge to the Hope set before us, which Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, sure and stedfast.</HI> What comes of a Vessel if it has no Anchor when a Storm riseth? It is broken to pieces. So the poor Souls that let their Hope go, bring themselves to confusion.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P>Meditate much on those things that are a sure ground of Conso∣lation. A great relief against all Despairing thoughts is, in the con∣sideration of the infiniteness of the Mercy of God. He is rich in Mer∣cy.
<PB N="118" REF="001134_0117_0FB089CF74D64690"/>
How great is his Goodness? No man can say how great his Goodness is. No man can say how far his Mercy may extend. And medi∣tate on the infinite Merit of the Death of Christ. A man may safe∣ly venture his Soul on that bottom. The greatest sinner may safely say, <HI>If there is not Merit enough in the Blood of Christ to save me, let my Soul perish for ever.</HI> Well then, think much &amp; often on the infinite Merit of that precious Blood. And re∣member also, that God takes plea∣sure in them that Hope in his Mer∣cy, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147. 11. They that Pray to God, and Hope in his Mercy, and Confess their Sins and Hope in his Mercy, and Turn, from Sin to God and Hope in his Mercy, God takes pleasure in them. For then the more Glory will come to his Name the greater their Sins have been. Sayes <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 25. 11. <HI>For thy Name sake Pardon mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni∣quity
<PB N="119" REF="001134_0118_0FB089D0ECE879A8"/>
for it is great.</HI> The greater the Iniquity of any poor Creature has been, the greater Glory will come to God by the Pardon of it. Therefore God takes pleasure in it, when very great Sinners return to him and hope in his mercy. Remember also, that others that have sinned as much as you, have found pardoning mercy with God. There is not any one here this day, but as great a sinner as he, has been Pardoned. What a bloody Sinner was <HI>Manassch?</HI> And yet when he humbled himself greatly, the Lord had mercy on him. What think you of the <HI>Jews</HI> that em∣brewed their hands in the Blood of Christ? They were far greater Sinners than <HI>Cain,</HI> who murdered his Brother <HI>Ahel.</HI> And yet many of those very men that Crucified the Son of God, had their Sins forgiven for the sake of that Blood that was shed by them. Let not

<PB N="122" REF="001134_0121_0FB089DCE4BAE0B8"/>
Since then there have been such instances in the world, let no one Despair of finding Mercy with God, if they turn to him in JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P N="2">II. There is a Good Despair which I am to Exhort you unto, namely, <HI>Despair of finding Mercy if you con∣tinue Impenitent.</HI> Godly sorrow works Repentance to Salvation.

Christ said, <HI>Except you Re∣pent you perish.</HI> One thing in Re∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nce is to Pray and Cry to God for Mercy. As it was said to <HI>Simon Magus, Repent and Pray, if it be pos∣sible to Sins may be forgiven thee.</HI> But without repenting and praying and seeking to God, Despair of ever finding forgiveness.

<PB N="123" REF="001134_0122_0FB089E3B2E8BED0"/>
wilt not forsake thy sins, as well as confess them. And yet all the Repentance in the world can't make atonement for sin. If thou shouldest weep Seas of Tears, that would not make amends for the wrong done to God by thy Sins. If thou shouldest give ten thousand Rivers of Oyl, Yea, the Fruit of thy Body for the Sin of thy Soul, all won't do. Only Christ can do that. Only the Obedience and the Righteous∣ness of Christ can make satisfaction for Sin. Therefore Despair of ob∣taining the forgiveness of thy sins without a Christ. <HI>They that are without Christ are without Hope.</HI> And without the Righteousness of Christ there is nothing but Despair that sinners may promise to themselves. Oh! Then look to Him above all things. It was well spoken by an Eminent Minister on his Death-bed, <HI>When I look on the best Works that

And he speaks of the <HI>Ancient of Dayes.</HI> This also helps to understand that Scripture. <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. 64. where Christ sayes, <HI>That they should see the Son of Man stand∣ing at the Right hand of Power;</HI> Al∣luding to that Supreme Court of Ju∣dicature among the <HI>Jews.</HI> He that was in Power and Dignity next to the <HI>Praesident,</HI> sat at his right hand.

must appear before the Son of God, and either be <HI>Absolved</HI> or <HI>Condemned</HI> by him. This Day of Judgment is set forth from three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Separation:</HI> There will be a Separation made between the Righ∣teous &amp; the Wicked. The Righteous are noted by the <HI>Sheep on the right hand;</HI> the Wicked by the <HI>Goats on the left hand.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A Sentence that then shall be passed on all the Men in the world, or that ever shall be.</HI> As for the Righ∣teous it will be said to them, <HI>Come ye Blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Kingdom pre∣pared for you:</HI> As for the Wicked it shall be said to them, <HI>Go ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is here noted the Execu∣tion of that Sentence.</HI> That is in the Verse before us. And altho' the Sentence shall be passed first on the Righteous, nevertheless the Execu∣tion will be first on the Wicked. <HI>These shall go away into Everlasting

Punishment:</HI> It will certainly affect the Righteous inexpressibly, and cause them to admire the Grace of God, and to praise his Name to Eternity, when they shall see such ter∣rible Execution done to all the Wicked in the world, and them∣selves not only to be delivered from that Punishment, but to have Life, and Life Eternal too given to them.</P>
<P>The words afford us this <HI>Doctrine,</HI><ABBR>Viz.</ABBR></P>

<P><HI>That is said to be Eternal which is of Everlasting duration.</HI> Sometimes E∣ternity is taken in a more strict sense, namely for that which has

Eternity is an infinite standing <HI>Now,</HI> that admits of no succession; and thus only the <HI>First Being</HI> is Eternal, &amp; has therefore that Name of I AM given to him▪ <HI>Exod</HI> 3. 14.

God is the Eternal; and is thereby distinguished from all false gods▪ and from all Crea∣tures▪ whatsoever. Isa. 57. 16. <HI>He is the High and Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty One that in∣habits Eternity.</HI> But in Scripture Eternity is many times taken for the same with Perpetnity.

Thus the Punishment of sinners, their Misery in another world is said to be Eternal Mar. 3. 29. <HI>They shall have Eternal Damnation.</HI> And the Happiness of the Righteous is said to be Eternal: As in the Text be∣fore us, <HI>They shall go into Life E∣ternal.</HI> When therefore it is said that every Man is going into Eter∣nity, the meaning is, that every Man is going into an Unchangeable Estate, an estate that shall be for∣ever Unchangeable; and is going to a place where he must be for∣ever and ever, through out the A∣ges of <HI>Eternity.</HI></P>

<HI>One Generation goes away &amp; another comes.</HI> Or, it is like a <HI>passing Room,</HI> through which we go, but do not set down to rest in. So as to this world, here is not our rest, here is not the place for us to abide in; but in another room of the Universe, and not on this Earth.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That World that men go into after they are out of this world, it is an Eternal World.</HI> That is mentioned in the Scripture as the difference between this present visible world, and that which is invisible, 2 Cor. 4. 18. <HI>The things which are seen are Temporal, but the things which are not seen are Eternal.</HI> So this world which our mortal Eyes see, it is a a Temporal world; but as to the unseen world it is an Eternal world. This Earthly world and all things

that are Regenerated, that have ex∣perienced a new and heavenly Birth. Joh. 3. 7. <HI>You must be Born again,</HI> Born from above as the word there is. Now a heavenly Birth does in∣cline men to walk in that way that brings to Heaven. Grace, true Grace is a spark of the heavenly World; it is Heaven in the beginning of it. Grace is called Glory in the Scrip∣tures, for that it is Glory in the beginning of it, and it ends there. If God has given Grace to a man, 'tis an infallible sign that he is bound for Heaven; if he has true, saving, sanctifying. Grace wrought in his Soul by the Spirit of God. Ephes. 1. 13, 14. <HI>We are Sealed with the Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our Inheritance.</HI> Heaven that is the In∣heritance▪ promised to us, if the Spirit of God hath sealed us: If he hath made impressions of the Di∣vine Image upon us, in respect of a work of Sanctifying Grace, that

is the <HI>Sealing</HI> of the Spirit, which is an earnest, a sure sign that such a Soul is bound for heaven. There are some in the world that have true Faith in Jesus Christ, a Faith that works by Love, a Faith that causes them to be Obedient unto <HI>All</HI> the Commands of God. Now this Faith leads to Heaven, 1 Pet. 1. 9. <HI>Re∣ceiving the end of your Faith the Sal∣vation of your Soul.</HI> If a man then have true Faith wrought in him, that Faith will end in the Salvation of his Soul in Heaven to Eternity. If a man has Faith, then the Righte∣ousness of Christ is his.

impossible for him to be shut out of Heaven. Some then are going in that way that leads to Heaven. Now Heaven it is an Eternal world. 'Tis called an Eternal House. 2 Cor. 5. 1 <HI>If our Earthly Tabernacle were dissol∣ved, we have an House Eternal in the Heavens.</HI> It is called an Eternal Inheritance, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 15. And the <HI>Heavenly Jerusalem</HI> is said to lye four square, <HI>Rev</HI> 21. 16. importing the Immutability of the Heavenly state, that it is an Unchangeable Estate. And therefore Heaven is said to be a City that has Foundations, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 10. 'Tis not like the Tents of Old that had no Foundations, but might be pulled up and removed. <HI>It hath Foundations whose Maker &amp; Builder is GOD,</HI> sayes the Apostle. The great∣est Cities in the world, the most famous that ever were of Mens building, have been destroyed. But this is a City, a Building that shall never be destroyed; because of the

Country, he shall never be removed from thence any more. Rev. 3. 12. <HI>He shall go out no more,</HI> sayes Christ. In this respect the <HI>Heavenly Paradise</HI> does infinitely ex∣cel the <HI>Earthly one. Adam</HI> was turn∣ed out of that, but the Believer shall never be turned out of this. 'Tis therefore called an <HI>Everlasting Habi∣tation,</HI> Luk. 16. 9. <HI>That they may receive you into Everlasting Habita∣tions.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are some, &amp; alas the greatest part of the Children of men, that are going in the way to Hell.</HI> This is true of all Prophane ones, Drunkards, Swearers, Children that are Disobedient unto their Parents, Unclean persons, Theeves, Liars, and all such, they are going in that way that leads to Hell. As it is said concerning the Harlot, Prov. 7. <HI>ult.

that have only the Form of Godliness, but are strangers to the Power of it; tho' they may them∣selves think they are in the the way to Heaven: and others may think so of them too; yet it is not so, they are not in the way that brings to Heaven. Mat. 5. 20. <HI>Except your Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> The Jews were wont to say of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> <Q>That if there were but two men in the world that should go to Hea∣ven, a Pharisee would be one and a Scribe the other.</Q> And yet we see what Christ the Son of God has said, if men have not a better, a great∣er Righteousness than they, they shall in no case enter into the King∣dom of Heaven.

Eccl. 11. 8. <HI>The dayes of Dark∣ness are many:</HI> The dayes of that Darkness are innumerable many. The Souls that are fallen into that Pit can never be redeemed. As in Psal. 49. 8. <HI>The Redemption of the Soul ceaseth for ever:</HI> 19. ver. <HI>They shall never see light.</HI> They are in a Dungeon that they must never come out of. Therefore <HI>Jude</HI> sayes, 13. ver. <HI>For them is reserved the black∣ness of Darkness for ever.</HI> Hell is an Everlasting Prison. They that are in that Prison must never come out again. Mat. 5. 25, 26. <HI>Lest he cast thee into Prison, whence thou shalt not come out till thou hast paid the ut∣most

Farthing.</HI> That is to say, Never, to Eternity.

The fire that is in Hell is an Eternal fire; therefore Hell is sometimes called by the name of <HI>Tophet</HI> in Scripture, Isa. 30. ult. <HI>Tophet is prepared of old, the pile of it is fire and much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, &amp; the breath of the Lord like a stream of Brimstone does kindle it.</HI> To open that Scripture: <HI>Tophet</HI> was in a val∣ley between <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> and in that Valley it was that the Angel from Heaven smote the Camp of the <HI>Assyrian;</HI> in respect of which Providence 'tis said, <HI>Who can stand before a Consuming Fire?
<PB N="146" REF="001134_0145_0FB08A2D247DFEC8"/>
Who can dwell with Everlasting Burning?</HI> The Idolatrous <HI>Jews</HI> were wont to burn their Children to death, to the Idol <HI>Moloch</HI> in <HI>Tophet.</HI> In that Valley there was a great Idol of Brass, made in the form of a Man, they put their Children in it, and then put fire under it, and burnt the poor wretches to death. They called that Valley, <HI>The Valley of the Son of Hinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> that is the Valley of Roaring: The poor miserable Chil∣dren when the fire scorched them to death, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and roar most lamentably. <HI>Josiah</HI> in an holy Zeal defiled that place by casting dead Bones there, and the Garbage of the City, and that so no Annoyance might be made by it, there was a fire kept continually: So did it be∣come a Type of Hell where the fire never goes out.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Every man in the World is in one of these two wayes that have been

mentioned.</HI> Either in the way that leads to an <HI>Eternal Heaven,</HI> or else in the way that leads to an <HI>Ever∣lasting Hell.</HI> For there are but those two wayes to be thought of which concern immortal Souls, and every man on the face of the Earth is go∣ing in one of them. Mat. 7. 13, 14. <HI>Narrow is the way that leads to Life, broad is the way that leads to De∣struct on.</HI> Every man is either in the Narrow way, or in the Broad way. The way to Heaven is the Narrow way, the way to Hell is the Broad way. As there are, so there always have been ever since there were any number of men in the world, two sorts of men. The old distin∣ction is that, Gen. 3. 15. <HI>The Seed of the Serpent,</HI> and, <HI>The Seed of the Woman.</HI> This distinction divides the whole World, 1 Joh. 3. 10. <HI>There are the Children of God, &amp; the Chil∣dren of the Devil.</HI> Now as for the Children of God they are going to

Heaven; but the Children of the Devil are going to Hell. So then if every man in the world is in one of these two wayes, either in the way to Heaven, or in the way to Hell; and if that Heaven is Eter∣nal, &amp; Hell is Eternal, this Doctrine must needs be true, <HI>That every Man in the World are going into Eternity.</HI></P>

If a man comes to a place where he finds many Houses, and some of them stately Buildings, suppose no man to be seen there, yet he concludes some men have been there to build such Houses, for they could not make themselves. So when men look on the world and see what Creatures there are, what mighty and glorious Creatures some of them are, as the Sun in the Fir∣mament, and fixed Stars innumera∣ble, &amp; (as Astronomers conjecture) greater than the Sun it self; they cannot but conclude surely then there is an Eternal God to be the Creator of these things: They then are most unreasonable, and their Error worse than Diabolical that

There are some Lights that will burn for for many Ages. It is reported that the Ancient Romans would artifici∣ally resolve Gold into a liquid sub∣stance, which would continue burn∣ing for many Ages. And that there was a Lamp found burning in the Tomb of <HI>Constantius Clorus,</HI> (Father of the great <HI>Constantine</HI>) buried in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> (then known by the name of <HI>Britain</HI> only) which had been blazing for above a Thou∣sand Years.

It is also related that in the Tomb of <HI>Tullya</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Ci∣cere,</HI> there was a Lamp found burn∣ing Fifteen Hundred and Forty Years after it was first lighted. And if so,

shall it seem incredible that the Spi∣rit of a Man which is the <HI>Candle of the Lord,</HI> shall endure forever? But alas, many do not lay to heart these solemn Truths, they do not consider of them as they ought to do. There∣fore <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks as in Eccl. 3. 21 <HI>Who knowes the spirit of a Beast that goes downward, &amp; the spirit of a Man that goes upward?</HI> Who considers it as they should do? 'Tis true (sayes the wise Man) the spirit of a Beast goes downward, his spirit his sensi∣tive soul dyes with him: but it is not so with a Man, when he dyes his soul goes upward into the hands of God. But who knows this? There are ve∣ry few in the world that consider this us they ought to do: but men live as if they had only sensitive and not immortal Souls in them Luk. 12. 19. <HI>Soul,</HI> (sayes that miserable wretch) <HI>Eat, Drink &amp; be Merry.</HI> One of the Ancients says of that rich Fool that if he had the soul of a Swine in him,

For what are their thoughts concerned about, but only temporal things? Christ says, Mat. 6. 25. <HI>Take no thought for the Body what ye shall eat &amp; drink.</HI> But the most of men take no thought a∣bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any thing else, but things of that nature. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no thought about their Souls, or about another Life, about Eternity and the other World into which they are going a∣pace every day. How few among Christians, but what are practical <HI>Sad∣duces,</HI> practical <HI>Atheists?</HI> How few are there that remember &amp; practise the advice that Christ gives to his Disciples, Mat. 6. 33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness.</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="001134_0154_0FB08A4D195755D0"/>
How few are there who make Reli∣gion their business? A sign they don't believe an Eternity. It is most certain that if men had a firm belief of their going into Eternity, they would make Religion their business, that they would mind, that in the first place, that above all other things.</P>

<P>Consider 1. <HI>This is the One thing needful.</HI> We should often think of those words of Christ, Luk. 10. ult. <HI>Thou art cumbred about many things, but One thing is needful.</HI> And what is that?

the world, and the pleasures of sin for a season, will venture the loss of Eternal Happiness, &amp; plunge their immortal Souls into Everlasting Mi∣sery. The blessed Martyr <HI>Hooper,</HI> when one tempted him to renounce the Truth, because Life is sweet, and Death is bitter, answered wisely, But <HI>Life Eternal is more sweet, &amp; Death E∣ternal is more bitter.</HI> Another Martyr, the inquisitor saying to him, that his Life was in his own hands, well re∣plied, <HI>Then it were in an ill keeping. But Christs School has taught me to save it by losing it, &amp; not by the gaining of a few Dayes or Years, to lose Eternity.</HI> Those holy Martyrs were (&amp; all good men are) sensible, that to make sure of a blessed Eternity, is the One thing needful above all other things. As for the many things that people are cumbring themselves about, and carking for, they are not needful. About what are men encumbring themselves? 'Tis how they may get

great Estates, and live high in the world, and leave great Portions to their Children. Oh, My Friends, that is not needful: You shall not, nor shall your Children after you, enjoy them long. All these things are but for a moment. It is more needful that you think what will become of your own Souls, and your Childrens Souls to Eternity, &amp; that it may go well with them for∣ever in another World.</P>
<P>Consider 2. <HI>That we shall all of us be very shortly in Eternity.</HI> It is not only true, that we are all going into Eternity, but that we shall be quick∣ly there: For the great Day of Judgment will be here e're long.

There is no man that goes out of this world, but as soon as ever his im∣mortal soul is out of his body, he knows certainly where he must be throughout Everlasting Ages, whe∣ther he shall be in Heaven or in Hell to all Eternity.

<P>Answ. 1. <HI>Let our chief care be a∣bout those things that will go with us into the Eternal World.</HI> An Inte∣rest in Christ will do so: If the Soul is by Faith United to Christ, that Union will never be dissolved through out the dayes of Eternity. All o∣ther Relations will cease, they will come to an end. The Relation be∣tween Father and Children, Master and Servant, Husband and Wife, they will soon come to an end. Aye, but if a man is Related to Christ, that Relation abides forever. There∣fore Christ sayes, Hos. 2. 19. <HI>I will betroth thee to me forever.</HI> Oh make sure that your Souls be Married to Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that Relation will abide World with∣out end.

from Faith and Love, they will pass with you to the other World; they will follow you. <HI>Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord: their works follow them,</HI> Rev. 14. 13.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> If we would enter into a Blessed Eternity, we should redeem the Time. Eterni∣ty does depend on improving that moment of Time, we have here in this world allowed to us. O don't mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your precious Time, that you be not made to repent of it to Eternity. Don't spend time in <HI>Sin∣ning.</HI> We ought not to spend any part of our time in sinning against God; we have done too much of that already: the time past may

suffice. Neither spend too much time in <HI>Recreations.</HI> Some time spent in Recreation is lawful, but too much time spent therein will be un∣comfortable in another World, and it may be on a Death-bed t'will cause sad Reflections. Our Famous Prince <HI>Henry</HI> lying on his Death∣bed, a Noble Man coming to him with whom he had spent much time in Recreations, He said, <HI>In vain do I now wish for those Hours again that you &amp; I have spent in vain sports.</HI> Be sure to spend a suitable portion of time in Reli∣gious Exercises, in Prayer, and in Reading the Holy Scriptures. They that have the greatest Employments are not exempted. God required of the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> that they should with their own hands write out some part of the Scripture. The Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> with his own hand wrote out the New Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣ment. Some Learned Men who

have spent their Time industriously and profitably, yet when they came to Die, have bewailed it as a great Evil they had been guilty of, in that they had spent no more time in Prayer, and Reading the Scripture. Never did any man when he came to Die say, I have spent too much in Prayer, and Reading the Scrip∣tures; but many have done the con∣trary. Then be careful to improve Time well, because when it is past there is no recovery of it. An Eminent Divine speaks of one the occasion of whose Conversion was, he heard a poor dying Creature speak these words, <HI>Can you call Time again? If you can't, I am undone to Eternity.</HI> O then improve Time unto Soul-saving ends and purposes.</P>

It may be God will bless serious Consideration on it, to the Conversion and Salvation of your Souls. Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> speaks of a Per∣son of Quality that had mispent some of her time in playing at Cards, &amp; one Night coming home late, she found her Servant Reading in a good Book, to whom the Gentle-woman said, <HI>Ah!
