<HEAD>The End of Piracy.</HEAD>
<P>ANTIQUITY Entertains us with Prodigious Relations, of the Miseries which Mankind have suffered from the Growth of PIRACY. But perhaps no Example of growing. PIRACY has been more con∣siderable, than what the <HI>Romans</HI> were in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested withal, after the Destruction of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> When those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Cities were destroy'd, the Inhabitants not having a place of Re∣treat, or means of Subsistence, betook themselves to <HI>Piracy</HI> as their Profession; and there were not want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People to Encourage them. 'Tis not easie to imagine the Heighth of Power, that so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Society arose unto, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> with which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>

their Dominion. All Commerce was interrupted; The City <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat was the Empress of the World was well nigh Starved; Some of its Magistrates as well as the other principal Citizens, fell into the Hands of the Robbers. The Coasts of <HI>Italy</HI> were every where mo∣lested and the Robbers with their Vessels, Entered the very <HI>Tiber,</HI> as if <HI>Rome</HI> it self were designed for a Prey unto them. The Temples and Cities, which lay near the Sea, were Sacked; and they had the Command of no less than Four Hundred Towns on the Coasts, unto which they might retire in Cases of Extremity; while other Marine Cities paid Ransomes to them for their Liberties. These <HI>Praedacious Animals,</HI> tho' they were dispersed o∣ver the whole <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> yet set up a sort of Commonwealth, and Elect∣ed Governours, and had above One Thousand Ships of several sorts, and formed <HI>Regular Fleets</HI> to carry on their Disorders. They had their Ports, their Watch-Towers, their Arsenals and Magazines; and <HI>Cilicia</HI> was, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, their Citadel, from whence they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out Supplies for their Squadrons,

upon occasion. An Extraordinary Re∣medy was required, for a Mischief be∣come so Formidable. The Courage and Conduct of <HI>Pompey</HI> was the Remedy. The <HI>Romans,</HI> assisted by the <HI>Rhodians,</HI> furnished <HI>Pompey,</HI> with five hundred Ships, and all the Provisions that were necessary. <HI>Pompey</HI> surpass'd the Hopes of them that Employ'd him; and in less than Three Months time he purged the Sea of <HI>Pirates;</HI> Conquered their whole Fleet; Pursued 'em to the For∣tresses they had prepared among the Rocks of <HI>Taurus;</HI> Compelled the most of them to surrender upon Discretion; and lost not one Ship in the Expedi∣tion.</P>
<P>Before the PIRACY on the <HI>Atlan∣tick,</HI> by reason of whom <HI>Sailing is now dangerous,</HI> arrive to any thing like what we have seen on the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> Crown, Equips a Squadron of Men of War for their Extirpation. And, <HI>May our Glorious GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suc∣cess unto the Enterprize.</HI></P>

<P>About the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> there came upon the Coast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ship called, <HI>The Whido</HI> whereof one <HI>Bellamy</HI> was Commander: <HI>A Pirate Ship,</HI> of about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men, and 23 Guns. These <HI>Pirates,</HI> after many other Depraedations, took a Vessel which had Wines aboard; and put Seven of their Crew on Board, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Orders to Steer after the <HI>Whido.</HI> The seven <HI>Pirates</HI> being pretty free with the Liquor, got so Drunk, that the Captive who had the Steering of the Vessel, took the opportunity of the Night, now to run her ashore, on the backside of <HI>Eastham.</HI></P>
<P>A Storm was now raised and ra∣ging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Whido</HI> ignorantly fol∣lowing the Light of her Stranded Prize, perished in a Shipwreck, and the whole Crew were every one of them drowned, except only one <HI>En∣glishman,</HI> and one <HI>Indian,</HI> that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on Shore alive.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001901_0006_0FB9CEA29D163290"/>
§ 3. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>redibly affirmed, That when these Barbarous Wretches, per∣ceived that their Ship was breaking under them, and that they must Swim for their Lives, they horribly <HI>Mur∣dered all their Prisoners</HI> (whereof they had a great Number) aboard; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they should appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Witnesses</HI> against them. The doleful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heard unto the Shore, a little before they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Bloody <HI>Wounds</HI> found in the Bodies afterwards thrown ashore; were two great Confirmations of this Report.</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> How far they Wickedness of Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> them.</HI></P>

The Delivered People said, <HI>Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a Prey to their Teeth!</HI></P>
<P>§ 5. After some waiting for Direc∣tion, His Excellency, Colonel SHUTE, the Governour, of <HI>New-England,</HI> re∣ceived, such Orders, that the Trial of <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> who had <HI>not been drown∣ed</HI> might be proceeded in.</P>
<P>Accordingly on <HI>Tuesday, October</HI> 22 1717. there was held at <HI>Boston,</HI> a Special Court of Admiralty (accord∣ing to the <HI>Act of Parliament</HI>) for the Trial of</P>
<P><HI>Simon Vanvoorst,</HI> who was Born at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Brown,</HI> Born in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Baker,</HI> Born at <HI>Flushing</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<P>The Last was Cleared; But the o∣ther Six, after a very fair Trial, were
<PB N="9" REF="001901_0008_0FB9CEA56B24DC60"/>
found <HI>Guilty,</HI> and received Sentence of Death.</P>
<P>§ 6. The Ministers of <HI>Boston,</HI> impro∣ved the Time, which the Clemency of the GOVERNOUR allowed for that purpose, to bestow all possible <HI>Instruc∣tions</HI> upon the Condemned Criminals; Often <HI>Pray'd</HI> with them; Often <HI>Preach∣ed</HI> to them. Often <HI>Examined</HI> them, and <HI>Exhorted</HI> them; and presented them with <HI>Books of Piety,</HI> suitable to their Condition. And perhaps, there is not that Place upon the face of the Earth, where more pains are taken for the Spiritual the Eternal Good of Condemned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

You cannot <HI>Repent,</HI> if you do not Refund unto the utmost of your Capacity.

How fear∣fully, how fatally, how irrecoverably are the Souls of many <HI>Unjust Men</HI> en∣tangled in the <HI>Snares of Death?</HI> They cannot hope to find Favour with GOD, or an Acceptance among true <HI>Paeni∣tents,</HI> if they do not endeavour all the <HI>Restitution</HI> that is possible. But will they ever come to this? No, The <HI>Vomit</HI> is too strong for them; they'll sooner dye than come unto it! Foo∣lish Men; You have at once <HI>lost</HI> all that you have <HI>got!</HI> You must with your own hands throw all <HI>over-board,</HI> if 
<PB N="53" REF="001901_0052_0FBA16488F447668"/>
you would not be <HI>drown'd in Perdition</HI> at the Last!</P>
<P>Secondly. A <HI>Good Esteem</HI> is lost, by them who <HI>get Riches</HI> in the Ways of <HI>Dishonesty;</HI> A <HI>Good Esteem</HI> among all those, who are <HI>willing to live in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI> We have been told, Prov. XXII. 1. <HI>A good Name is rather to be chosen than great Riches.</HI> 'Tis far more Honourable and Repu∣table, to be a <HI>Good Man,</HI> than to be a <HI>Rich Man.</HI> It will most of all be found so, in the Day when every Man shall <HI>receive Praise of God,</HI> who is found worthy of it. But now as a <HI>Thief is ashamed when he is found,</HI> so 'tis a <HI>shame∣ful</HI> Thing to be found a <HI>False-dealer</HI> in any Degree, in any Affair: It makes a Man <HI>lightly esteemed.</HI> All <HI>Baseness</HI> in any Dealing, is a <HI>Blemish</HI> on the <HI>Dealer.</HI> To <HI>Deal unjustly with any Man;</HI> 'tis a Blot in any <HI>Scutcheon.</HI> The Kings themselves that have done it, are of, of what Memory, I beseech you? No one believes it, if they say, A <HI>Blessed</HI> One.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="001901_0053_0FBA164B029D2C98"/>
Thirdly, Yea, <HI>a Good Conscience</HI> is <HI>Lost.</HI> And that's a worse <HI>Loss,</HI> a Thou∣sand Times; a <HI>Loss</HI> which if we were wise, we should at any time <HI>take Joy∣fully the Spoiling of our Goods,</HI> for the preventing of! When a man <HI>gets Riches and not by Right,</HI> he has a <HI>Conscience</HI> within him, which tells him, <HI>He does what the ought not to do.</HI> The Servant of GOD could say; Heb. XIII. 18. <HI>We have a Good Conscience, in all things wil∣ling to Live honestly.</HI> Men don't keep a <HI>Good Conscience,</HI> when they don't <HI>Live Honestly.</HI> The man that has taken more than his own, is he, of whom we read, <HI>A Dreadful Sound is in his Ears;</HI> And again, <HI>Terrors shall make him afraid on every side.</HI> His Wounded <HI>Conscience</HI> keeps roaring in his Ears; <HI>Thou hast wronged thy Neighbour, and there is a Just GOD, who is a dreadful Revenger of such Wrongs at these.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Folly</HI> for a man to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur the <HI>Reproaches</HI> of an <HI>Angry Conscience.</HI> All the <HI>Riches</HI> of a <HI>Chaldean</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Monarch, would be too dearly bought, if a man must have them accompanied with the Lash∣es of a <HI>Guilty Conscience,</HI> furiously Re∣proaching of him. All the <HI>Relish</HI> of 
<PB N="55" REF="001901_0054_0FBA164D6370D488"/>
<HI>Riches</HI> is <HI>Lost;</HI> Rocks of Diamonds, &amp; Mountains of Gold, are not worth a Straw; where the <HI>Conscience</HI> is like the <HI>Troubled Sea,</HI> and <HI>there is no peace unto the Wicked!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly; The <HI>Loss</HI> of the SOUL is horribly <HI>Endangered;</HI> Yea, without <HI>Repentance,</HI> the <HI>Danger</HI> is <HI>Unavoidable.</HI> And oh! that the awful words of our SAVIOUR, who knew the <HI>Worth</HI> of a SOUL, were duly considered with us; Mat. XVI. 26. <HI>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole World, and Lose his own Soul!</HI> We commonly say, <HI>One may buy Gold too dear.</HI> If the SOUL be bartered away for <HI>Gold,</HI> verily, we <HI>buy Gold too dear!</HI> To get <HI>Riches and not by Right,</HI> is to render the SOUL obnox∣ious to the Wrath of GOD. A SOUL perishing under the Wrath of GOD, is a <HI>Lost SOUL.</HI> Such is the SOUL of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> &amp; of him who in Ill Wayes does <HI>make Haste to be Rich.</HI> No man can <HI>Wrong</HI> another man, but it may be said of him, <HI>He wrongs his own SOUL.</HI> A very Unjust man had it said unto him; Hab. II. 9, 10. <HI>Wo to him that Coveteth an Evil Covetousness; Thou hast Sinned against thy SOUL.</HI> To <HI>Lose</HI> the

<PB N="57" REF="001901_0056_0FBA1650840BDBB0"/>
comes at the <HI>End</HI> of an <HI>Unjust Life;</HI> This, This will discover the Matchless <HI>Folly</HI> of all that is not <HI>Honestly</HI> done in and for the Getting of <HI>Riches.</HI></P>
<P>They that <HI>Get Riches and not by Right,</HI> must know, that <HI>this Trade won't Last always.</HI> Their Way, &amp; their Life, must come to an <HI>End.</HI> It won't be Long before they have such Tidings bro't unto them; Ezek VII. 6. <HI>An End is come, the End is come, it watcheth for thee, behold, it is come!</HI> No <HI>Riches</HI> will keep any man always alive. 'Tis no New Thing, to have it said, <HI>The Rich man died.</HI> It is an Occurrence of daily Experience, <HI>That they who boast them∣selves in the multitude of their Riches,</HI> cannot Redeem a Brother, no, nor themselves, to <HI>Live for ever, and not see Corruption.</HI> Verily, <HI>The Fat Ones of the Earth cannot keep alive their own Souls.</HI> Much less, will the <HI>Mammon of Unrighteousness,</HI> keep off the Arrest of <HI>Death.</HI> But now, at the <HI>Death</HI> of the man who <HI>gets Riches and not by Right,</HI> What will there be Observable? Some∣thing to be Observed, by which the <HI>Folly</HI> shall be <HI>manifest unto all men.</HI> Come, Let us <HI>Mark the Unjust man, 
<PB N="58" REF="001901_0057_0FBA1653B6DCCCC0"/>
and behold the False Dealer,</HI> for <HI>the End of that man,</HI> will declare him to be a <HI>Fool.</HI></P>
<P>First. There is oftentimes, an <HI>Early Death,</HI> in the <HI>Strange Punishment</HI> for these <HI>Workers of Iniquity.</HI> They that <HI>Get Riches, and not by Right,</HI> are often∣times thus <HI>Punished;</HI> They must <HI>Leave them in the midst of their Days.</HI> Thus, we find a <HI>Rich Fool</HI> promising himself <HI>Goods Laid up for many years.</HI> But, <HI>in the midst of his Days</HI> he feels this Order from Heaven served upon him; Luke XII. 20. <HI>Thou Fool, This night thy Soul shall be required of thee; Then whose shall these things be, which thou hast provided:</HI> The man must not Live to Taste the Sweet of his <HI>Ill-gotten Goods.</HI> And per∣haps the <HI>Wealth</HI> of the Sinner, is Left unto a man more <HI>Just</HI> than himself. GOD required His People to <HI>deal Righ∣teously</HI> with one another, and Employed this motive; Deut. XXV. 15. <HI>That thy Days may be lengthened in the Land, which the Lord thy GOD giveth thee.</HI> But in <HI>Unrighteous Dealings,</HI> men take the most Ready Course, that their <HI>Dayes may be Shortened in the Land.</HI></P>
<P>It is especially thus, when men grow 
<PB N="59" REF="001901_0058_0FBA165504561B80"/>
more <HI>Dangerous Criminals,</HI> and are so sharp set with the <HI>Cursed Hunger of Riches,</HI> that they do things wherein <HI>Humane Society</HI> shall be considerably Damnified. Our Gracious GOD has a Wondrous Tenderness for <HI>Humane So∣ciety;</HI> And when men grow so Outra∣geous in the Ways of <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> that <HI>Humane Society</HI> suffers Insupportable Damages from them; Now there goes up that Cry to Heaven, <HI>'Tis Time, Lord, for thee to Work!</HI> And, GOD comes down, GOD steps in, GOD in Com∣passion to <HI>Humane Society,</HI> fulfils that word upon the man who <HI>trusted in the abundance of his Riches, and Strengthen∣ed himself in his Wickedness;</HI> Psal. LII. 5. <HI>GOD shall take thee away, and plack thee out of thy Dwelling-place, and Root thee out of the Land of the Living.</HI> Such <HI>Dangerous Criminals</HI> are <HI>Wicked overmuch.</HI> And the Doom of them that are <HI>Wicked overmuch,</HI> is, <HI>To Dy before their Time.</HI> Such <HI>Dangerous Criminals</HI> are Left sometimes to do <HI>Bloody</HI> as well as <HI>Deceitful</HI> Things. And the Doom of such <HI>Bloody and Deceitful men,</HI> is, <HI>They shall not Live out half their Dayes.</HI> Yea, many times

the Wretches run into <HI>Capital Crimes.</HI> It is reckoned among the Crimes of them who are <HI>Greedy of Gain;</HI> Prov. I. 15. <HI>Their feet run to Evil, and make Haste to shed Blood.</HI> The <HI>Sword</HI> which is to defend <HI>Humane Society,</HI> now ani∣madverts upon them. That <HI>Sword</HI> of GOD cuts them off. They <HI>Dy</HI> at the Place of Execution, and <HI>as a Fool dieth.</HI> O dismal Sight! <HI>Young men</HI> drawn to the Place of Execution! <HI>Young men,</HI> who must <HI>flee to the Pit,</HI> and none may <HI>stay them! Young men,</HI> hurried out of the World, for having forfeited their Lives, by <HI>Getting Riches, and not by Right.</HI> Such a <HI>Sight</HI> is this Day to be seen a∣mong us; <HI>Behold, All ye your selves have seen it!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, But let the <HI>Death</HI> of the Wicked come when it will, be sure it <HI>Scribs</HI> them of all the <HI>Riches</HI> they were Possessed of. The <HI>Riches</HI> which have been <HI>gotten, and not by Right,</HI> many times Leave men before they <HI>Dy.</HI> There is a secret Blast from GOD, up∣on the <HI>Estates</HI> that have not been <HI>Ho∣nestly</HI> come at. GOD has many Ways to blist Ill gotten Estates, and make such <HI>Treasures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to melt away to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Yea, Sometimes, if a man do

but get a <HI>Little</HI> unrighteously, it proves a <HI>Moth</HI> to all the rest that he has got∣ten, and brings a strange Consumption upon it. But whether this fall out or no; This you may be certain of: When men Dy, then they must Leave all that they have <HI>got.</HI> So we are told, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> VI 7. <HI>We brought nothing into the World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</HI> Ah, Dying Man, Thou art going, thou art going from all thy <HI>Possessions:</HI> When thou <HI>Dyest,</HI> thou shalt <HI>carry no∣thing away,</HI> neither shall thy <HI>Glory de∣scend after thee!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. At the <HI>Death</HI> of men, and at the <HI>End</HI> of all, it will be found, That SIN <HI>is what nothing is to be gotten by!</HI> To <HI>Sin,</HI> 'Tis to do a <HI>Deceitful Work. O the <HI>Deceitfulness of Sin!</HI> Men dream of <HI>Getting,</HI> I know not what, by <HI>Sinning</HI> against the Blessed GOD. But, <HI>Be not Deceived:</HI> In the <HI>End</HI> it will be found, That nothing is to be <HI>Gotten,</HI> by the <HI>Unfruitful Works of Darkness.</HI> Men may for a while Hatter themselves, that <HI>Sin</HI> will bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>small Gain unto the Crafts men;</HI> But Syrs, I will call upon you, as the Prophet of old upon a <HI>De∣ceived People; What will ye do in the end

<P>After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Admonitions from GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> SAVIOUR, if hope, there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctions. <HI>Piety,</HI> that will find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Reception with you.</P>
<P>First. It is to be hoped, That if a∣ny of you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Riches, and not by Right;</HI> you will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it; Seek a Reconciliation with GOD; And come to that E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solution; Job XXX<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>If I have done Iniquity, I will do it no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly.

<P>Thirdly.
