<HEAD>THE Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Controversies about Forms of <HI>Ecclesiastical Disci∣pline,</HI> concern not the <HI>Essen∣tials</HI> of Religion, but that G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Men may be of various Sentiments about them; <HI>Salva Fide, et Carit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> is readily acknowledged. Nevertheless, there ought to be a sin∣gular Regard unto Truths of this Na∣ture, by us in <HI>New-England,</HI> above what may be affirmed of Men in a∣ny other Part of the World, since our Fathers were Persecuted out of their Native Land, and fain to fly into the Wilderness, for their Testi∣mony thereunto: great were the Dif∣ficulties and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mptation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Straits, which they for some time conflicted

with, and all upon no other Account, but that so they might enjoy a <HI>pure Discipline and Church state,</HI> exactly conformable to the Mind of <HI>Christ,</HI> revealed in the Holy Scriptures. On which Account, for their Posterity to depart from what their Fathers have with so much Clearnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Scripture Light, taught and practised, and confirmed with so great Suffer∣ings; must needs be a greater Sin and Provocation to the Eyes of his Glory, than may be said of any other People on the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Forms</HI> of <HI>Church-Govern∣ment,</HI> besides those of the <HI>Congregatio∣nal Way,</HI> there have been especially two Pretenders to a <HI>Divine Right, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose that plead for the <HI>Episcopal,</HI> and those that are for the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Dis∣cipline. In the famous Treaty at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x∣bridge</HI> between eminent Divines of both Persuasions, after they had been for <HI>some</HI> time arguing the Matter, the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣quiss of <HI>Hertford</HI> spoke to this Effect; <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Whitlock's <HI>Memorials. p.</HI> 123.</NOTE> <HI>My Lords,</HI> (said he) <HI>here is much said concerning</HI> Church Government <HI>in

general; the Reverend Divines on the Kings Part affirm, that</HI> Episcopacy <HI>is</HI> Jure Divino; <HI>the Reverend Ministers on the other Part do affirm, that</HI> Pres∣bytery <HI>is</HI> Jure Divino; <HI>for my part, I think that neither of them, nor any other Form is</HI> Jure Divino, <HI>and therefore de∣sire we may hear no more about that Con∣troversy.</HI> I could easily say as that Noble Lord did, as to the two conten∣ding Parties, without concurring in his general Negative. I have been told, that the admirably Learned Dr. <HI>Prideux,</HI> (once <HI>Regius Professor</HI> in <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> and a great Ornament to that U∣niversity) being asked what Form of Church-Government he thought was of Divine Institution, replied, that he supposed that no particular Form was <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> but if any were so, it was that which Congregational Men made a Profession of. The Protestant Churches in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lvetia,</HI> have no Ecclesi∣astical Discipline; but if any Members of <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tigurine Lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgy. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 133.</NOTE> their Churches fall into Scan∣dals, they turn them over to the Civil Magistrate to discipline them.

It deserves a Remark, that <HI>Robert Brown,</HI> the Father of those called <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pagit.

They are the ge∣nuine Posterity of the good <HI>Old Puri∣tan Nonconformists.</HI> There was long since an admirable little Book, (little in bulk, but great in worth) Printed with that Title, <HI>Puritanismus Anglica∣nus,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> has honoured with a Preface, whence he has been suppo∣sed to be the Composer of it. But a Learned <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hornbeck Epist▪ ad Durium. p.</HI> 27.</NOTE> Professor in the Univer∣sity of <HI>Leyden,</HI> has informed us, that not Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> but Mr. <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> an Eminent Nonconformist Minister, (whose Life has been written by Lear∣ned Mr. <HI>Gataker,</HI> and published by Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>) was the Author of that Judici∣ous
<PB N="vi" REF="001836_0007_0FB91612188CB2D0"/>
Script. It is perfect <HI>Congregationa∣lism.</HI> The Principles of those, who are for the Congregational Discipline, are such as these. 1. That a Particu∣lar Church, as to the Matter of it, ought to consist of such as are in the Judgment of rational Charity, <HI>Saints, and faithful Brethren in Christ.</HI> Of such were the Churches planted by the Apostles. 2. That the <HI>Form</HI> of a Church, or that which does essentiate and disti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guish it from all other Socie∣ties, is a <HI>Covenant</HI> or Agreement to walk together in the Observation of all the Ordinances of the Lord Jesus Christ; which Covenant, tho' only implicit, gives Being to a Church; nevertheless, that an explicit Covenant is most eligible. 3. That a Particular Church, has Power given to them from the Lord Christ, to Choose their own Officers, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Pastors, Teachers, Ru∣ling-Elders, and Deacons. 4. The Es∣sence of a Minister's Call to the Pasto∣ral Office, is in a mutual Election. They are for the Imposition of the Hands of the Presbytery in Ordi∣nation. Nevertheless, they look not on that as essential, but as adiaphorus.

In which they agree with some Emi∣nent Divines of the Presbyterian Judg∣ment, particularly with Mr. <HI>Gillespy,</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>English Popish Ceremonies. p.</HI> 285.</NOTE> nay with the general Kirk As∣sembly in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as whoever shall consult Mr. <HI>Calderwood,</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>History of Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>p.</HI> 26, 383, 418, 425:</NOTE> will find it often asserted. 5. That a Particu∣lar Church being furnished with El∣ders, at least with a Teaching Elder, has full Power to exercise Discipline within it self, without depending on any other Superiour Jurisdiction. The famous Mr. <HI>Paul Baine</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diocesens Trial.</HI></NOTE> affirms, particular Churches are equal and <HI>in∣dependent</HI> on one another. He is (so far as I understand) the first Writer by whom that Term has been used.

So for</HI> (say they) <HI>was our Judgment from that</HI> In∣dependent <HI>Liberty, which has been im∣puted to us.</HI> 6. As all Protestant Wri∣ters of Note (<HI>Grotius</HI> only excepted) approve of the Necessity and Usefulness of Ecclesiastical Councils, so do those of the Congregational Discipline. It has ever been their declared Judgment, that when there is Want of either Light or Peace in a Particular Church, it is their Duty to ask for Council, with which Neighbour Churches ought to assist by sending their Elders, and other Messengers, to advise and help them in their Difficulties. And that in Momentous Matters of common Concernment, Particular Churches should proceed with the Concurrence of Neighbour Churches. So in the Ordination of a Pastor, much more in the deposing of one. Thus it has ever been in the Churches of <HI>New∣England.</HI> And so it was in the more Primitive Times of Christianity, when the People had Chosen a Pastor, they desired Neighbour Pastors to Concur

So when any Church had sufficient Cause to depose a Pastor, they would not do it without the Ad∣vice of a Council. When <HI>Paulus Sa∣mosetanus</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Euseb. Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Cap.</HI> 30.</NOTE> was deposed for his Hae∣retical Opinions, it was with the Con∣currence of a Council, which met at <HI>Antioch,</HI> about that Affair. When <HI>Privatus</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Lambese</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cyprian▪ Epist.</HI> 55.</NOTE> was deposed, it was with the Advice of many other Pastors.</P>
<P>But if those of the Congregational Discipline are so well affected to Coun∣cils, what then is the Difference be∣tween a Presbyterian and Congregatio∣nal Man? Truly, a moderate Presby∣terian and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olid Congregational Man differ so little, as that 'tis Pity they
<PB N="xi" REF="001836_0012_0FB9161C9A970D78"/>
should differ at all. My Dearest Bro∣ther <HI>Samuel Mather</HI> (whose Succes∣sor I am here in <HI>Boston,</HI> he having been the first that preached the Gos∣pel to that Church unto which I have been related for more than fif∣ty years, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter his Removal from <HI>New-England,</HI> became the Pastor of a Congregational Church in <HI>Dublin,</HI> where also he was succeeeded by a∣nother Brother, the well known <HI>Na∣thaniel Mather</HI>) wrote an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enicum,</HI> in which he makes it evident, that the Difference among the Brethren of those two Persuasions, is inconsiderable. A principal is, that Presbyte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sup∣pose that Synods have a <HI>Juridical Pow∣er,</HI> that they have Authority to Cen∣sure Erring Churches, and if obsti∣nate, to deliver them to Satan. But those of the Congregational Persuasi∣on, think, that such Authority belongs only to a Particular Church, and that Synods cannot proceed any further than to <HI>a Sentence of Non communion.</HI> Surely, notwithstanding this Difference, they may be <HI>United Brethren.</HI> And blessed be God, that in <HI>London</HI> they are so. I can reflect on it with Joy, that
<PB N="xii" REF="001836_0013_0FB9161E18F98A18"/>
when Providence ordered my Sojourn∣ing among them four years, I was not wanting to do my Part towards that Union Mr. <HI>Rutherford</HI> declared, that if those of the Congregational Way, would come up to Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> in his Keys of the Kingdom, he would meet them half way<HI>:</HI> The truth is, there is a greater agreement in many things be∣tween the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Congregational Men in <HI>New-England,</HI> than with them and some o∣thers that go under the Name of Pres∣byterians. Particularly, in that they do not make the Essence of a Ministers Call to be in that Rite of Imposition of Hands, but in the Election of the Peo∣ple, and in that their Ruling Elders are Chosen for term of Life. Also in <HI>Scotland</HI> they greatly approve of Read∣ing the Scriptures in Publick Congre∣gations, but not of a <HI>silent Reading,</HI> without any Exposition. They gene∣rally say with their famous <HI>Didoclavi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> (alias <HI>Calderwood</HI>) <HI>Non probo lecti∣onem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine interpretatione;</HI> and with <HI>Au∣stin,</HI> who says, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Legitur si silebitur, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> non exponitur.</HI> Nor do their Ministers use to Conclude their
<PB N="xiii" REF="001836_0014_0FB916205999AE30"/>
Prayers with the Lord's Prayer, as many other Presbyterians, as well as Episcopalians commonly do. But for Ministers to pretend to a Negative Voice in Synods, or for Councils to take upon them to determine what El∣ders or Messengers a Church shall sub∣mit unto, without the Choice of the Church concerned; or for Ministers to pretend to be Members of a Counci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without any Mission from their Chur∣ches, nay, altho' the Church declares that they will not send them; is <HI>Prela∣tical,</HI> and essentially differing not only from Congregational, but from Pres∣byterian Principles. And now that I am going out of the World, I could not die in Peace, if I did not discharge my Conscience in bearing Witness a∣gainst such Innovations, and Invasions on the Rights, and Liberties belonging to Particular Congregations of Christ.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> were Planted a Noble Vine, wholly a right Seed, if now there is a visible Degeneracy or Declen∣sion as to the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> and so as to <HI>Discipline,</HI> it is not to be won∣dred at. Primitive Purity has rarely

with him an <HI>Elder</HI> and a <HI>Bishop</HI> are the same) that were among them. This Epistle of <HI>Clement</HI> to the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> is supposed to be written four∣ty years after the Apostle <HI>Paul'</HI>s Epis∣tle to them. But in the next Age to the Apostles, no more than one Pastor or Bishop might be in one Church. This we see in the Epistles of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> in the Age next following the Apo∣stles. And in the Age after that, <HI>Cyprian</HI> <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ubi supra.</HI></NOTE> says, <HI>Unus in Ecclesia Sacerdos. Tertullian</HI> said as much be∣fore him.

<HEAD>A DISQUISITION Concerning Ecclesiastical Councils.</HEAD>
<P>AN <HI>Ecclesiastical Council,</HI> or <HI>Synod,</HI> is a Conventi∣on of duly qualified Per∣sons, called to Consult, and judge about Affairs, in which Churches, one or more are concerned. There have been great Disputes on that Question, <HI>Who has Power to Convoke a Synod?</HI> Whether it belongs to Magistrates, or to Pastors. I shall not insist upon that Enquiry, only say, that if we keep to Scripture, Churches have this Power Belonging to them. There have likewise been some who have de∣cried <HI>all Ecclesiastical Councils</HI> as useless,
<PB N="2" REF="001836_0023_0FB9163881C2A730"/>
nay, pernicious; and as having always done hurt to the Interest of Religion. <HI>Nazianzen'</HI>s <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>in Epist. ad Procopium.</HI></NOTE> Expressions Con∣cerning this, are famously known. <HI>Bel∣larmine</HI> Charges <HI>Luther</HI> with being of that Opinion, but he wrongs him. If <HI>Luther</HI> was against all Councils, why does <HI>Bellarmine</HI> complain of his being <HI>President</HI> of a Council, Convened at <HI>Wittenberg,</HI> in the Year 1536. in which there were (as he says) <HI>Three Hun∣dred Pastors.</HI> I know not of one Pro∣testant Writer of any Fame, that dis∣likes all <HI>Synods, Grotius</HI> only Excepted: It cannot be denied, but that the great∣est part of Ecclesiastical <HI>Convocations,</HI> have done more against the Truth then for it, as any man that Consults <HI>Al∣sted'</HI>s Chronology of Councils, will ea∣sily perceive. But this has proceeded not from the nature of Councils, but from the faultiness of the Persons, of whom they were Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stituted. The greatest part of Magistrates, and of Miniisters, and of Professed Christians have been Erroneous and Vicious. This
<PB N="3" REF="001836_0024_0FB9163AB244F908"/>
ought not to prejudice Men against Magistracy, and Ministry, and Chris∣tianity. The same is to be affirmed of Synods, of which also there have been more than a few that have been blessed for the Suppression of Errors, and Establishment of the Churches in the Truth. Several Particular and Provincial Synods have given a faith∣ful Testimony against Errors, both in Judgment and Practice. Writers in∣form us, that <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eachard. Eccles. History, p.</HI> 343.</NOTE> <HI>The first Ecclesias∣tical Council,</HI> after that held at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> was in the year 180. in which the Heresy of <HI>Montan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and his Fol∣lowers was Condemn'd.

And the four <HI>Oe∣cuminical</HI> Councils (altho' as <HI>Calvin,</HI> and many others have observed( we cannot say that any one of them was

altogether free from Error in some les∣ser points, were blessed for the Sup∣pressing of the Haere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, which did in∣fest the Church in those Ages. The <HI>Nicene</HI> Synod, in which there were 318 <HI>Bishops,</HI> or <HI>Pastors,</HI> besides a nume∣rous Company of Elders, and others whom the Emperour himself, the great <HI>Constantine</HI> honoured with his Presence, Condemned the Heresy of <HI>Arius.</HI> This has been Esteemed the most Celebrious Synod that ever was in the World. 2. The first General Council at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> in which there were an hundred and fifty Pastors, Condemned the Heresy of <HI>Macedonius.</HI> 3. In the great <HI>Ephesine</HI> Synod, there were two hundred Pastors, in which the Heresy of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> who maintained that Christ is two Persons, was Condemn∣ed. This Synod Convened, <HI>A. D.</HI> 431. In this very City of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> there was another Synod, though not a general one) held but nineteen years after the first; in which an Heretica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Error on the other Extream was Esta∣blished, and several Members of the Synod Compelled by Tortures to Sub∣scribe the Decrees of the Majority. In
<PB N="5" REF="001836_0026_0FB9163E6F3DA4A8"/>
so short a time have Synods in the same place, greatly varied from one another. 4. In the General Synod at <HI>Chalcedon, A. D.</HI> 451. there was 630 Pastors, be∣sides Presbyters and Laymen, as they are called: This Synod was of great use in Confuting and Condemning the Heresy of <HI>Entyches,</HI> who held that there was but one Nature belonging to our Saviour Christ; it appears by these mentioned, that notwithstanding Coun∣cils are not infallible, nevertheless, they have been very helpful to discover the Truth, and settle the Churches in the profession of it. They are necessary, tho' not absolutely to the <HI>Being,</HI> yet to the <HI>Well-being</HI> of Churches. I have said nothing of the <HI>Synods</HI> which have been among the <HI>Reformed,</HI> in these lat∣ter Ages, in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and in other Countries, by some of which the Interest of the true Religion has been a great gainer. It has been Ob∣jected by some, <HI>Where have we an In∣stitution for Synods?</HI> We answer, that the Light of Nature directs unto it: <HI>Plus vident Oculi, quam Oculus.</HI> Ma∣ny Eyes see more than one. The Scripture says, <HI>Where no Counsel is the
<PB N="6" REF="001836_0027_0FB9164255A0DD80"/>
People fall, but in the multitude of Coun∣sellors there is safety.</HI> Prov. 11. 14. And therefore they that are wise, will in their difficulties ask for Counsel. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20. 18. <HI>They were w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to speak in old time, saying, they shall surely ask Counsel at</HI> Abel; <HI>and so they ended the Matter.</HI> Moreover, we have Scripture Example for a Synod. The Church in <HI>Antioch,</HI> and that at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> under the Con∣duct of the Apostles, Convened in or∣der to Consulting on a Question, which was of common Concernment to them. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Of Gospel Churches. p.</HI> 252.</NOTE> therefore rightly observes, <HI>That Synods are Consecrated to the use of the Church in all Ages, by the Example of the Apostles, in their guidance of the first Churches of Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Gentiles, which had the force of a Divine Institution, as being by them under the Conduct of the Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>These things being premised, I pro∣ceed to what I have principally design∣ed in this <HI>Disquisition.</HI> There are two <HI>Problems</HI> relating to <HI>Ecclesiastical Coun∣cil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which I▪ have been desired to Ex∣dress my Thoughts and Judgment con∣cerning
<PB N="7" REF="001836_0028_0FB9164398A74398"/>
them. One of the Questi∣ons is,</P>
<P><HI>Whether no Acts of Councils are to be received as Concluding and Decisive, for which there is not the Concurrence of the Major part of the Pastors therein Con∣cerned?</HI></P>
<P>The Affirmative I can in no wise Concur with. I may suppose, that I have as much reason to know what has been the practice of these Churches, as most Men now alive; having been (however unworthy) in the Teach∣ing Office among them for more than two and fifty years; (which so far as I understand, no other Minister now in <HI>New-England</HI> has) and assisting in ma∣ny Councils of the Churches, in which I never knew but that the Concurrence of the Major part of the Delegates was Decisive: Nor was it ever declared, that one half of the Pastors in Synods should have a Negative on the whole Council; nor Asserted, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tors have a greater Authority than <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Elders,</HI> which is implied in the Question under Consideration.

My further Reason for Non-concurrence therewith are these.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Synod at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (the first and only Council of Churches mentioned in the Scripture) The Pas∣to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there did not Assume to them∣selves a Negative over the other Mes∣sengers; therefore neither ought it to be so now. It is clear, that not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but Brethren acted in that Council; and that Brethren, and not Pastors only should be sent to Synods, it acknowledged by us all. It has been disputed between <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI> whether the Brethren, or Pastors only have a definitive Suffrage in Sy∣nods. <HI>Papists</HI> are for Pastors only, and
<PB N="9" REF="001836_0030_0FB9164758A3D4B0"/>
so are our <HI>Prelatical</HI> Writers; one of them lately giveth it for the definition of a Synod, <HI>That it is an Assembly of the Hierarchical Order in Consult for the Conduct of the Churches.</HI> But our most Eminent Protestant Divines maintain, that Ruling Elders and Brethren have equally a definitive Voice with the o∣ther; and this they prove, because it was so in the Synod at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> they argue strongly; Why was the Cause brought to the Brethren, and not to the Pastors only if they had not power to judge and to determine concerning the Question before them? The De∣crees of that Synod were sent to the Churches <HI>in the name of the Brethren,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Apostles and Elders.</HI> Acts 15. 22. <HI>It pleased the Apostles and Elders, with the whole Church to send Chosen Men;</HI> and ver. 23. They wrote Letters by them after this manner; <HI>The Apostles, and Elders, and Brethren, send greeting;</HI> and ver. 25. <HI>It seemed good to us,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Brethren as well as El∣ders;</HI> and ver. 28. <HI>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay no greater burden then these necessary things.</HI> The Council at <HI>Basil</HI> would not admit of
<PB N="10" REF="001836_0031_0FB9164BB3090488"/>
the <HI>Pope'</HI>s Superiority over the whole Council, as if the Council could not make a Valid Act, if the <HI>Pretended Pa∣stor</HI> over all the Churches did not Con∣cur; and they reasoned thus, (as I find our Protestant Divines have done) that word <HI>Edoxe,</HI> which is translated, it <HI>pleased,</HI> or it <HI>seemed</HI> good to us (which word is used three times by the Synod at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) being spoken not of Pa∣stors only, but of others also; it does evidently import, that those others, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Assembly had a Power of Judgment and Determina∣tion in the Question under debate. They in whose Names the Synodal De∣crees were sent to the Churches, had undoubtedly a suffrage, and the right of a definitive Sentence in them. But this was done in the name of the <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> as well as of the Pastors. Now then, if the major Part of all those who have in common the power of a defi∣nitive Sentence Concurr, the Act of the Council is Valid, and ought to be decisive. It has been objected, that in <HI>Acts</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ 4. 'tis said, that the Synodal Decrees <HI>were ordained by the Apostles and Elders,</HI> without any mention of
<PB N="11" REF="001836_0032_0FB9164C98B49D90"/>
the Brethren, therefore it may seem that the Brethren had not a Vote therein. To this both Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> and our Learned <HI>Parker</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Polit. Eccles. Cap.</HI> 22. <HI>p.</HI> 396.</NOTE> Reply, that by a <HI>Synechdoche</HI> (very usual in the Scripture) the Apostles and Elders, being a chief part of the Assembly, are put for the whole, the Brethren being included, and are expresly mentioned in the former Chapter. It is past doubt that the Question was brought to the Multitude, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 12, 13.

Office, but the Churches dele∣gation, which gives them a right to be there. It was once disputed, whe∣ther the Bishops have not a Negative on the House of Lords, so that there can be no Valid Act of Parliament without their Concurrence. Mr. <HI>Ba∣shaw,</HI> (a Learned Lawyer) proved they had not; because they did not Sit there by virtue of their Office, but of the <HI>Baronies</HI> which belonged to them. If then <HI>Pastors</HI> do not Sit in <HI>Council</HI> as Officers, but as Messen∣gers deputed by their Churches, they may not Claim a <HI>Negative.</HI> They would have no right to be in this or that Synod, if their Churches did not send them. True it is, when a Coun∣cil is Called for, the Churches ought to send their Pastors, for they should be, and often are, most able to Judge in Ecclesiastical Affairs. The words in our Platform are these<HI>: Because none are, or should be more fit to know the State of the Churches, nor to ad∣vise of ways for the good thereof, than Elders; therefore it is fit in the Choice of Messengers for such Assemblies, they have special respect to such.</HI> Never∣theless,
<PB N="14" REF="001836_0035_0FB91651D8CD6550"/>
they do not Sit there as Pas∣tors, Officers, Rulers. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> speaks Judiciously, and like himself in saving, <HI>That no Persons by virtue of any Office meerly, have right to be Members of Ecclesiastical Synods as such; neither is there either Example or Reason to give colour to any such pretence: Officers of the Church ought to be Present in them▪ but meerly as such, it belongs not to them.</HI> They who say, this is pure <HI>Independent Doctrine,</HI> discover their own ignorance; for <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linger, Hyperius, Dane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Voeti∣us, Vedeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and <HI>Zeperus,</HI> who were no Independents, have said as much as this amounts unto, which I have in another Discourse taken notice of.

<P N="1">1 Churches or Persons, whose Case calls for a Council, ought no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have their Liberties Infringed, but they may, and ought to address themselves to such as from whom they may Ex∣pect the Clearest Light in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifficul∣ties before them.

to them than that at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> for the Synod did not meet there be∣fore the Year of Christ 49, which was sixteen or seventeen years after our Lord's Ascension. Within that time Christianity had wonderfully Increased. The <HI>Disciples</HI> were called <HI>Christians</HI> six years before that. <HI>Paul</HI> was Convert∣ed fourteen years before that, and had (as well as other Apostles) settled many Churches in <HI>Syria,</HI> which were not so remote from <HI>Antioch</HI> as <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> was; why then would they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far as <HI>Jerusalem?</HI> but because they knew the most able Counsellours in Church Affairs resided there, some of the Apostles especially, and those par∣ticularly who seemed to be Pillars, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Peter, James,</HI> and <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn.</HI> It is supposed that no other Apostles, besides these were present in the Synod at <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Altho ordinarily it is most pro∣per, yet nevertheless, it is not always necessary no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proper for those who need Counsel, to address themselves to such as are nearest to them. <HI>Antioch</HI> was about 260 miles distant from <HI>Jeru∣salem;</HI> and yet for the reason before∣mentioned,
<PB N="33" REF="001836_0054_0FB9167CD7FF4F80"/>
with other Considerations, they passed by many Churches which were nearer to them, and went to <HI>Je∣rusalem.</HI> It is possible, that the near∣est Churches may be prejudiced, or pre-ingaged, and therefore not so pro∣per to be Concerned in a Council, as some others more remote.

<P N="3">3. It belongs not to Ministers Autho∣ritatively to direct or to impose upon any agrieved Persons, to whom or to what Churches they shall address them∣selves for Counsel.

<P>Thus have I impartially declared my Judgment on the Controverted Ques∣tions. Whether the Arguments which satisfie me, will satisfie others, I must Leave with the Divine Providence: Some I believe will on <HI>Second Thoughts</HI> Change their Sentiments. I come now to that which was the main thing In∣ducing me to this <HI>Disquisition.</HI> I would not by what I have written be misun∣derstood, as if I were disaffected to the <HI>Consociation of Churches,</HI> in order to the preservation of the Faith and Or∣der of the Gospel professed by them. I know no man that has appeared in this Cause more than I have done.

<PB N="35" REF="001836_0056_0FB91681D8A22ED0"/>
Judgment concerning it, as that which is not only lawful, but absolutely ne∣cessary for the Establishment of these Churches. The Light of natural rea∣son, as well as Scripture, teaches Chur∣ches in Common with other Societies, to <HI>Associate</HI> and Combine for their Common Safety. This was practised among the Churches, in the Primitive Times of Christianity; and it is so in most of the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> at this day. Some who are not Christians, have seen a necessity of Consociating, to uphold the false Re∣ligion professed by them. To say nothing of many Modern Instances, A late Learned <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vitringa de Synag.</HI></NOTE> Writer informs us, that some Ages since, there hap∣pened a great Contention among the <HI>Jewish Synagogues</HI> then in <HI>France,</HI> car∣ried on by three <HI>Rabbins</HI> of Note a∣mong them, who were on that ac∣count Cast out of their Synagogues, but others admitting them; what had been done proved insignificant, until they came to a <HI>Consociation,</HI> the Issue whereof was, that the Beginners of
<PB N="36" REF="001836_0057_0FB916841979E190"/>
the Schism were made uncapable of giving them any further Trouble. Now if the Children of this World shall be so wise in their Generation, as to Concur and Consent for the Upholding Superstition; Why should not the Churches of Christ (having the Countenance of his Word in their doing of it) <HI>with one Consent</HI> main∣tain the Faith and Order of the Gos∣pel? Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> would sometimes be∣wail the deficiency of the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> in this particular; and he did with great solemnity Re∣commend the Consideration of it to Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> (the famous Pastor of the Church in <HI>Cambridge</HI>) when he gave him the Right-hand of Fellow∣ship at his Ordination. And not long before he went to be among the Spi∣rits of Just Men made Perfect, He drew up, <HI>Propositions concerning the Consociation and Communion of Church∣es, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndred to the Elders and Brethren of the Churches, for their Consideration and acceptance according to God.</HI> Which <HI>Propositions</HI> falling into my Hands, I Published them to the World above fourty years ago.

Not one other that I know of. Such an Unanimity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eems to be of God, and the Consideration of it should be of

should Leave with the Lord's People in this Land as my <HI>Last Legacy.</HI> I have Considered, that the Churches have now greater Cause than former∣ly to be Concerned by <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> and <HI>Scriptural Methods</HI> to preserve <HI>the Faith and Order of the Gospel,</HI> which has been delivered to them. A due attendance to what is from the Scripture declared in the <HI>Synod</HI> mentioned, with respect to the Com∣munion and Consociation of Church∣es, will, by the Blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ, be a good means to prevent Degeneracy, and to Establish them in that holy Faith and <HI>Order of the Gospel,</HI> which has been profes∣sed and practised among them; and by which the Religious People in <HI>New∣England,</HI> have been distinguished from other People. I have therefore Caused those <HI>Synodal Conclusions,</HI> to be Republish∣ed herewith, and recommend the consi∣deration of them, and an agreement to practise according to what is there de∣termined, with a steadfast adherence to the Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>form of Discipline, <HI>as my Dy∣ing Farewel to the Churches in</HI> New-En∣gland.

<P>Quest. W<HI>Hether according to the Word of God, there ought to be a Consociation of Churches, and what should be the manner of it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The Answer may be briefly given in the Propositions fol∣lowing.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Every Church or Particular Con∣gregation of Visible Saints in Gospel Or∣der, being furnished with a Presbytery, at least with a Teaching Elder, and walking together in Truth and Peace, hath received from the Lord Jesus, full Pow∣er and Authority Ecclesiastical within it self, regularly to Administer all the Ordinances of Christ; and is not under any other Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction whatsoever.</HI></P>
