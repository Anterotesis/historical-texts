And in the <MILESTONE N="11"/> case of any machine, he shall fully explain the principle and the several <MILESTONE N="12"/> modes, in which he has contemplated the application of that principle or <MILESTONE N="13"/> character, by which it may be distinguished from other inventions, and he <MILESTONE N="14"/> shall accompany the whole with drawings and written references, where <MILESTONE N="15"/> the nature of the case admits of drawings, or with specimens of the ingre∣dients <MILESTONE N="16"/> and of the composition of matter, sufficient in quantity for the pur∣pose <MILESTONE N="17"/> of experiment, where the invention is of a composition of matter; <MILESTONE N="18"/> which description, signed by himself and attested by two witnesses, shall be <MILESTONE N="19"/> filed in the office of the Secretary of State, and certified copies thereof <MILESTONE N="20"/> shall be competent evidence in all courts, where any matter or thing touch∣ing <MILESTONE N="21"/> such patent-right shall come in question.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Sec. 4. <HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That if any person shall make, devise <MILESTONE N="2"/> and use or sell the thing so invented, the exclusive right of which shall, as <MILESTONE N="3"/> aforesaid, have been secured to any person by patent, without the consent of <MILESTONE N="4"/> the patentee, his executors, administrators or assigns, first obtained in <MILESTONE N="5"/> writing, every person so offending shall forfeit and pay to the patentee the <MILESTONE N="6"/> sum of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> dollars, also, such damages as a jury shall assess, and more∣over <MILESTONE N="7"/> shall forfeit, to the person aggrieved, the thing so devised and used or <MILESTONE N="8"/> sold, contrary to the true intent of this act, which may be recovered in an <MILESTONE N="9"/> action on the case founded on this act, in the circuit court of the United <MILESTONE N="10"/> States, or any other court having competent jurisdiction.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Sec. 5. <HI>Provided always, and be it further enacted,</HI> That the defendant in <MILESTONE N="2"/> any such action shall be permitted to plead that he was the original inven∣tor <MILESTONE N="3"/> of the art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, for which <MILESTONE N="4"/> the patent was granted; and in case the fact shall be so found by the jury, <MILESTONE N="5"/> such defendant shall recover his legal costs against the patentee.</P>

"An <MILESTONE N="5"/> act for promoting the progress of useful arts,"
on complying with the con∣ditions <MILESTONE N="6"/> of this act, except the payment into the treasury herein before re∣quired, <MILESTONE N="7"/> and paying, instead thereof, the patent-fees required by that act, <MILESTONE N="8"/> shall be entitled to a patent for fourteen years, to commence from the date <MILESTONE N="9"/> of their several applications, and shall be within the purview of this act, as if <MILESTONE N="10"/> they had made such payment into the treasury, except that such persons <MILESTONE N="11"/> shall not be entitled to other damages than what may be assessed by a jury.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Sec. 8. <HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That whenever two or more persons <MILESTONE N="2"/> may apply to the Secretary of State, claiming patents for the same inven∣tion <MILESTONE N="3"/> or discovery, as to its principle and operation, and when it may be <MILESTONE N="4"/> questioned, which of the applicants was the proper and true inventor, it <MILESTONE N="5"/> shall be the duty of the Secretary to refer such interfering claimants to the <MILESTONE N="6"/> next supreme court of the United States; or where such claimants are in∣habitants <MILESTONE N="7"/> of the same district, to the circuit court thereof, giving notice <MILESTONE N="8"/> thereof to such claimants, who shall appear, if they see fit, and prosecute <MILESTONE N="9"/> their several claims before such court; and upon the appearance of such <MILESTONE N="10"/> claimants, and their giving bonds to prosecute their claims, and to pay <MILESTONE N="11"/> such costs, on failure, as may be taxed by the said court, a jury shall be im∣pannelled
<PB REF="023848_0003_0FC26CCA027FD8C8"/>
<MILESTONE N="12"/> to appear at such time as the said court shall direct for the trial of <MILESTONE N="13"/> such claims, and the party prevailing in such trial shall, upon producing a <MILESTONE N="14"/> certificate thereof to the said Secretary of State, be entitled to a patent, and <MILESTONE N="15"/> shall recover his legal costs before the said court against the adverse claimant. <MILESTONE N="16"/> And in case the adverse claimant shall make default of appearance, the party <MILESTONE N="17"/> appearing shall be entitled to a certificate of such default, which being pro∣duced <MILESTONE N="18"/> to the Secretary of State, he shall be entitled to a patent in the same <MILESTONE N="19"/> manner as though the cause had been tried and decided in his favor.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> Sec. 9. <HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That upon oath or affirmation being <MILESTONE N="2"/> made before the judge of the district court where the defendant resides, that <MILESTONE N="3"/> any patent which shall be issued in pursuance of this act, was obtained <MILESTONE N="4"/> surreptitiously, or upon false suggestion, and motion made to the said court <MILESTONE N="5"/> within one year after issuing the said patent, but not afterwards, it shall <MILESTONE N="6"/> and may be lawful for the judge of the said district court, if the matter al∣ledged <MILESTONE N="7"/> shall appear to him to be sufficient, to grant a rule that the patentee, <MILESTONE N="8"/> or his executor, administrator or assign, shew cause why process should not <MILESTONE N="9"/> issue against him, to repeal such patent. And if sufficient cause shall not be <MILESTONE N="10"/> shewn to the contrary, the rule shall be made absolute, and thereupon the <MILESTONE N="11"/> said judge shall order process to be issued, as aforesaid, against such paten∣tee, <MILESTONE N="12"/> or his executor, administrator or assign. And in case no sufficient <MILESTONE N="13"/> cause shall be shewn to the contrary, or if it shall appear, that the patentee <MILESTONE N="14"/> was not the true inventor or discoverer, judgment shall be rendered by such <MILESTONE N="15"/> court for the repeal of such patent; and if the party, at whose complaint <MILESTONE N="16"/> the process issued, shall have judgment given against him, he shall pay all <MILESTONE N="17"/> such costs, as the defendant shall be put to in defending the suit, to be <MILESTONE N="18"/> taxed by the court, and recovered in such manner as costs of defendants <MILESTONE N="19"/> shall be recovered in due course of law.</P>
