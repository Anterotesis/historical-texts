<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE SERMONS emitted herewith, were not written with my own Hand, but taken from me when Prea∣ched, by One that has a rare dexterity in Writing Characters, the same Person, who at first in Short hand, and after that in a very Ligible hand transcribed the <HI>Sermons on the Beatitudes,</HI> lately Printed. Upon the Perusal of <HI>these</HI> as well as <HI>those,</HI> I find them to agree with what I de∣livered: but therefore plainess of style, and inculcations must be ex∣pected.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002053_0003_0FBA8BAC685D1588"/>I have endeavoured to declare the great Truths of the Gospel with all possible plainess, and perspicuity, that the most ordinary Capacities might understand and be edified.</P>
<P>The Occasion of the <HI>Discourse</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>Sovereign Grace of God in the Salvation of the Elect,</HI> was, a Letter which a Worthy Minister, who lives in a Town remote from <HI>Boston</HI> sent to me, proposing that I would Preach and Publish some Meditations, on <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 8. I was the more willing to comply with his desire, that so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who am Expecting Death every day (and for that reason call these <HI>Ser∣mons, my dying Testimony</HI>) may leave something with that dear Flock (a∣mong whom I have been Labouring for the space of Eight and Fifty Years) which may help to confirm them af∣ter my Decease, <HI>in those Gospel Truths,</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="002053_0004_0FBA8BAE0AEFD5D0"/>
in opposition, not only to the Errors of <HI>Pelagius, Papists,</HI> and <HI>Socinians,</HI> but of <HI>Arminians,</HI> &amp; <HI>Semi-Arminians;</HI> such as <HI>Amyrald, Testardus, Camero, Ti∣lenus,</HI> (not to mention any <HI>New Me∣thodists</HI> of our own Nation) whose Writings are known to Learned Men, and well refuted by the very Learned <HI>Peter Du Moulin.</HI> These <HI>Discourses</HI> are not Published for the Instruction of great Scholars, but for the Confir∣mation and Establishment of the or∣dinary sort of Readers. And therefore they are not handled in a Polemick or Scholastick way, but in a Plain, Practical, and Scriptural Method.</P>
<P>The Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>Clarkson</HI> (who when belonging to the University, was Tutor to that E∣minent Man Dr. <HI>Tillotson</HI> late <HI>A. B.</HI> of <HI>Canturbury</HI>) has Written a Judici∣ous <HI>Discourse of Free Grace,</HI> with whose Sentiments I fully▪ concur.
<PB N="iv" REF="002053_0005_0FBA8BAEDE2DE420"/>
As also with Dr. <HI>Grew</HI> in his Excellent <HI>Sermons of Justification.</HI></P>
<P>It is with the Lord to make my Endeavours on a profitable Subject to become profitable. I often think of (and I wish Young Preachers would think of it) the Advice of the famous Dr. <HI>Sibs</HI> to Young <HI>Thomas Goodwin▪</HI> (who afterwards proved a no les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> famous <HI>Doctor</HI> than the other) <HI>Young Man</HI> (said he) <HI>if ever you would do good, you must Preach Christ and Free Grace.</HI></P>
<P>No Man can expect any thing great from me, as on other accounts, so in respect of my great Age. It is true, that there is sometimes an in∣stance of an Old Man of whom it may be said as it was of <HI>Moses,</HI> and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Caleb,</HI> That Age has not debilitated him.</P>
<P><HI>Nec tarda senectus Debilitat vires animi, mutatque vigorem</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="002053_0006_0FBA8BB186CD0EF0"/>It cannot be said so of me. Ne∣vertheless it is some Encouragement to me, that there have been aged Men, (and aged Ministers too) who have brought forth fruit in Old Age, by Writing as well as other ways. Dr. <HI>Sheaf</HI> wrote a profitable Book when he was, (as now I am) arrived to the Eightieth Year of his Age. There is a blessed Promise, Psal. 92. 14. <HI>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.</HI> Death (if the Lord shall so please) is far more Eligible than a useless Life, supposing it to be a death in the Lord. <HI>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do fol∣low them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Plain Discourse Concerning every Man's BIRTH SIN.</HEAD>

<BIBL>EZEKIEL XVI. 5.</BIBL>
<Q>—<HI>In the Day that thou wast born.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE design of the Prophet in the beginning of this Chapter, is to declare the woful condition the Jews were in before such time as God called them to be His People: They had no cause to be Proud of their Pedigree, yet they were so. They boasted that they had <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> for their Father, and that they were descended from such great &amp; good Men
<PB N="2" REF="002053_0008_0FBA8BB4EDB35740"/>
as <HI>Isaac</HI> &amp; <HI>Jacob;</HI> but the Prophet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them to understand that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> better than if they were descended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> whom they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meanest esteem of. Nay, the <HI>Amorite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the worst among the Canaanites. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father was an Amorite, and thy Mother an H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttite.</HI> In this with the preceding and following Verses <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is com∣pared unto a wretched Exposititiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Infant, cast out not in the Stree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where it might have some pity, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>open Field,</HI> where none eye pitie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it nor look'd after it. Thus by Parabo∣lical &amp; Allegorical Expressions the Pro∣phet sets forth the Miserable state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Jewish Nation when in AEgypt▪ There is also a Mysti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Spiritual Mea∣ning intended in the words; Namely to signifie that such as this is the case o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the Elect of God, till He shall please to Regenerate them. Wherefore the <HI>Doctrine</HI> is,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That the Children of Men are bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>There is a <HI>Birth-Sin</HI> that every Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="002053_0009_0FBA8BB66FA8F938"/>
has cause to be sensible of, and to be humbled for all his days: Men do bring <HI>Sinful Natures</HI> into the World with them: It is not only true that they are Sinful, but that they <HI>are born so.</HI> The Pharisees said to the man that was born blind, <HI>Thou wast altogether born in Sin:</HI> What they said was true, and if they said so of themselves, it had been as true. It is true of every Man that comes into the World, that he is altogether born in Sin. For the clearing the Doctrine, we shall first prove, That it is so. 2ly, In∣quire, How it comes to pass? For the proof of the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Holy Scriptures declares it.</HI> Gen. 8.21. <HI>The imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth.</HI> The Heart is put for the Soul, and all the powers and faculties of it; the Imagination of the heart, is the Mould in which thoughts are formed. The heart is like a Mint in which evil thoughts are Coyned continually. Thus it is with <HI>Man,</HI> not with this or that Man, but with every Man, and this from their <HI>Youth.</HI> The Hebrew word, <HI>Nagnar,</HI> is sometimes translated, a <HI>Babe,</HI> even Babes have this evil in them. The Chil∣dren
<PB N="4" REF="002053_0010_0FBA8BB82914A9A0"/>
of Men can no sooner think, no sooner set their imaginations on work but they are thinking and imagining that which is evil; and they can no sooner Speak, but they Speak that which they ought not. Psal. 58.3. <HI>They go astray as soon as they are born speaking lies.</HI> Chil∣dred are apt to do so as soon as they can Speak; and they no sooner do any thing but they do that which is Evil. Isai.48.8. <HI>Thou wast called a transgress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from the Womb.</HI> Thou wast called so; that is to say, Thou wast so: as that phrase is of∣ten to be so understood in Scripture. True it is, That as Man did at his first Creation come out of Gods hands, there was no Sin in him. Eccl. 7.29. <HI>God made man upright, but they have sought out ma∣ny inventions.</HI> They, our first Parents, <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; <HI>Eve,</HI> sought out many sinful In∣ventions; and all their Children after them are doing as they did. When God Created Man, he was made in the Image of God. Gen.5.1. <HI>In the day that God Cre∣ated Man, in the likeness of God made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him.</HI> But then it is said in the third Verse, That <HI>Adam begat a Son in his own likeness.</HI> The likeness of Adam is set
<PB N="5" REF="002053_0011_0FBA8BB9616FE408"/>
in opposition to the likeness of God. Another Scripture speaks to this pur∣pose: Job 11. 12. <HI>Man is born like the wild asses colt</HI> It is not only true that he is foolish and unteachable, but that <HI>he is born so:</HI> As it is said, <HI>Folly is bound in the heart of a Child.</HI> There is a bundle of folly in his Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is evident, In that <HI>Infant Children are obnoxious to the wrath of God.</HI> Eph. 2. 3. <HI>Children of wrath by nature.</HI> Sometimes they bring into the World with them sad tokens of the displeasure of God. Some are born Blind, some are born Deaf, &amp; so continue to be dumb all their days: Others bring woful diseases into the World with them; <HI>Natural</HI> dis∣eases which show they are subject to <HI>Moral</HI> diseases. Nay, they are subject to Death as soon as they come into the World; by that Argument the Apostle proves that Infants have the guilt of Sin upon them. Rom. 5. 14. <HI>Death reigned over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression.</HI> That is to say, That had not been guilty of any Perso∣nal Actual Sin; Death reigneth over them, therefore they are under the guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="6" REF="002053_0012_0FBA8BBB0CC36CF0"/>
of Sin, the wages whereof is Death▪ And there have been some Infants in the World, that God has manifested a special indignation against them: so the Infant Children of the Amalekites, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 3. GOD commanded <HI>Saul</HI> that he should destroy the Amalekites, par∣ticularly, <HI>The Infant &amp; the Suckling.</HI> And is it not said concerning the Infant Chil∣dren of the Babylonians? Psal. 137. 9. <HI>Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the Stones.</HI> Would it be so, if Children in their Infancy were altogether free from Sin? How many thousands, it may be Millions of Infant Children did there perish in the flood▪ how many when <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorah</HI> was destroyed? Concerning those that de∣struction fell upon, in the 7th. Verse of Judes Epistle: It is said, <HI>They suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men are naturally indisposed unto that which is good, and inclined to that which is evil. Original Sin</HI> (as every Mans <HI>Birth-Sin</HI> has ever since <HI>Austin</HI> expressed it by that Name, been commonly &amp; fitly called) consists in these two things, An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indisposition to that which is good, and an inclination to that which is evil.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="002053_0013_0FBA8BBC6CD12500"/>(1) Men are Naturally indisposed un∣to that which is good. Jer.4. 22. <HI>To do good they have no knowledge.</HI> Tit. 1. 16. They are <HI>unto every good work reprobate.</HI> A work that is <HI>Spiritually good,</HI> the Na∣tural Man has neither skill nor will for the performance of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor.2. 14. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, neither can be know them.</HI> He is not only unable, but <HI>averse</HI> to that which is Spiritually good. Therefore, when any good Motion is proposed to Sinners, presently they make excuses; it is natural for them to make excuse, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.18. When the offers of the Gospel was set before them, it is said, They <HI>all with one consent began to make excuse.</HI> And the better the Motion is, the more averse are Men naturally to close with it. What can be better than to come to <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Yet Christ com∣plains, Joh.5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</HI> Hence, Men are presently weary when engaged in a thing that is good: They say, as in, Mal.1.13. <HI>What a weariness is it?</HI> Thus the Jews concerning the Sabbath Day, <HI>Amos</HI> 8.5. They said, <HI>When will the Sabbath be gone.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002053_0014_0FBA8BBEA0BC3020"/>
Do we not see Men are weary of Sab∣baths, and hardly allow to GOD the ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the time they ought to do, the Se∣venth part of time. Are not Men weary of Sermons? How many come &amp; sleep at Sermons. Men by Nature do not love that which is holy; they don't love holy things, nor holy Men, they don't love the Holy GOD, by nature. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 30. They <HI>are haters of God:</HI> They are <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> there is in their hearts a <HI>Stygian,</HI> a hellish hatred of the blessed GOD; and they are haters of JESUS CHRIST the Holy One of GOD. Christ there∣fore says, <HI>Their Soul abhorred me,</HI> Zech. 11. 8. They don't love the Chil∣dren of God as such; the Seed of the Serpent have an Antipathy against the Seed of the Woman. <HI>Men in their na∣tural estate are the Seed of the Serpent:</HI> there is enmity in their hearts against the Seed of the Woman: Those that are godly they don't love them.</P>
<P N="2"> (2) <HI>Men are naturally inclined</HI> to that which is evil. Jer.4.22. <HI>They are wise to do evil,</HI> but to do good they have no knowledge; if there be an evil Motion they presently comply with it. It is
<PB N="9" REF="002053_0015_0FBA8BC1948E2178"/>
not true, which some assert, That Men become Sinners only by imitation, or by learning from others. Some Sins are learnt from others, yet if Men should live where they should see no Sin com∣mitted, they would Sin against GOD. Suppose a Child brought up in a Religi∣ous Family, and never heard a ly told in his life, yet that Child committing a fault will go to cover it by telling a lie, which shews that to Sin is Natural. Some have committed such Sins as none in the World before them did the like. Rom. 1.30. <HI>They are inventers of evil things:</HI> which shows they then are Sinners by <HI>Inclination,</HI> and not only by <HI>Imitation.</HI> Yea, a sad truth it is, That the worst of Sins, the vilest of Abominations are na∣tural to the Children of Men, tho' it may be God keeps them from committing them. The Apostle shewing what Men are by Nature, says, Rom. 3.15. <HI>Their se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t are swift to shed blood.</HI> Why? are all Men Murderers? Truly, they have Mur∣derous hearts within them. That holy Man Mr. <HI>Bradford,</HI> who dyed a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tyr, When he heard of any One Executed for Capital Crimes, would strike upon his
<PB N="10" REF="002053_0016_0FBA8BC2862234A8"/>
breast and say, <HI>In this heart of mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that which would make me commit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin, if God by His Grace did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me.</HI> All sorts of Sins are natural to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mat. 15. 19. <HI>Out of the heart proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tions, Thiefts, false Witness, Blasphemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> These proceed out of the heart; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are in the heart: how should the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proceed out of the heart, if there was no∣thing of them there. So that all sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Sins are natural to Men in this the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> corrupt, fallen estate. This may to som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seem impossible, because there are Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which seem contrary the one, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther; as Prodigality is contrary to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vetousness, yet in the same heart a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> both these. We see sometimes a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that has been Notorious for his Prodi∣gality, afterward that very Man shall become as Notorious for his Covet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us∣ness; then these corruptions are both of them in his heart. It is very true▪ There are special Sins which some Per∣sons are more apt to commit them, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> others, according to their natural Tem∣pers; some are naturally more subje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to anger, being of a passionate dispositi∣on;
<PB N="11" REF="002053_0017_0FBA8BC3E86EB928"/>
others are more subject to a spirit of revenge; others to Intemperance, and the like: Nevertheless, it is true, That all sorts of Sins are in the hearts of Men, and those Sins which they may seem to have an Antipathy to, yet even those Sins are in their heart, and it may be will discover themselves at the last. <HI>Saul</HI> seemed to have an Antipathy against Witches and destroyed them, yet this very <HI>Saul</HI> goes to the Witch of <HI>Endor</HI> to inform him how the War he was ingaged in should prosper. It has been noted of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, That he did abomi∣nate some Sins, As that of Drunkenness, and Stage-play, but it was because of some inconveniencies that attended them; he did not hate them as being Sins against GOD. Men naturally dis∣like the Law of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay they make it an occasion of Sin. The holy Apostle confesses it was so with him before his Conversion: Rom.7.8. <HI>Sin taking occasion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.</HI> Because the Commandment, said he, should not do such a thing, therefore he was the more ready to do it. <HI>Austin</HI> in his <HI>confessions

Some may be apt to think this is hard, Is this reasonable, why should we be punished for Adams Sin? We could not help what he did in eating the forbid∣ding fruit.

If Adam had not Sinned, we should all have fared the better for it: Not Original Sin, but Original Righte∣ousness would have been propagated.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle in the begi∣ning of this Chapter de∣clares to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> what they were before they had Faith in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> that they were dead in trespasses &amp; sins, and were Children of wrath; he also declares what the were since they had true Faith in Christ they were brought into a state of Salva∣tion: Which Salvation, in the words be∣fore us, is described from the Suprea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cause and Original of it; Namely, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Grace</HI> of God.

Apostle was much set upon that Subject of <HI>Grace,</HI> therefore he mentions it no less than three times in four Verses. In the 5th verse rather than not mention it he brings it in by way of Parenthesis: He no sooner speaks of <HI>Salvation</HI> but he thinks of <HI>Grace,</HI> as we see in verse 5,7,8. By Grace here, is not meant that Grace which is wrought in Believers, or Sancti∣fication; altho' it is true there is no Sal∣vation without that; without holiness no man shall see the Lord: but hereby is meant <HI>Grace without us,</HI> or the Grace of God. So then the Doctrine before us is,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That the Salvation of Believers on Jesus Christ, is to be ascribed wholly to the Soveraign Grace of God.</HI></P>
<P>There are three particulars that may be inquired into. (1) What is imply'd in this Salvation the Text speaks of? (2) What is meant by the Grace of God? (3) How it does appear that the Salva∣tion of Believers must be ascribed wholly and only to the Soveraign Grace of God.</P>

Now Election proceeds from Grace, Rom. 11. 5. it is called, <HI>The Election of Grace.</HI> It is not from any works in Men▪ No. Deut.7.7. <HI>The Lord loved you, because he loved you.</HI> Nothing out of God Him∣self can be given as the reason of it: It is then from Grace; it is not from any holiness, from any worth in Men, for be∣fore ever they had a Being God had a purpose of Mercy to them.

Eph.1.4. <HI>God hath chosen us before the foundation of the World, that we should be holy.</HI> Not be∣cause we are holy, but that we might be holy: we cannot suppose any cause of it, but the free Grace, and Favour of the most High.

It is required, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly that the matter of it be such as God requires; but that it proceeds <HI>from a right Principle,</HI> from a Principle of Faith in the heart.

Can a Sinner Merit Heaven, that has Merited Hell so often? Eccl. 7. 20. <HI>There is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not.</HI> In∣deed there are just Men in Heaven that are always doing good, and who do not sin; but there is not one such just Man upon Earth.

No proportion, therefore no Meritorious work.</P>
<P>USE▪ III. Since <HI>Believers on Christ are the objects of special Grace, and the sub∣jects of Salvation, Sin is more evil in them than in any Men in the World.</HI> Sin, is called <HI>the</HI> evil. Joh. 17. 15. <HI>Keep them from the evil.</HI> It is the evil of evils: one Sin has more evil in it than there is in all the afflictions in the World. It is im∣possible there should be a Sin committed that shall be a little evil, considering a∣gainst whom it is committed; never∣theless some Sins are greater than others. Sin is aggravated from the consideration of the person committing it. For an In∣dian, a Heathen to commit a Sin, it is not so bad as for a Christian to commit the same Sin. If Men are only visible Christians their Sin is worse than if o∣thers that do not make their Profession should be guilty of the same Sin, because they Sin against their <HI>Baptism</HI> that ob∣liges them not to Sin.

They would say, There was one <HI>David</HI> King over the Jews, he was guilty of Adultery and of Murder; they say this was one of their good Men, we won't be of their Religion that have done such wicked∣ness as this.

Think, has God done such things for me, what shall I do to promote His Glory in the World! and if the consideration of the Grace of God shall have that Effect upon us, as to cause us to be more holy, that will be an infallible sign that we are those very Persons whom Infinite Grace will make the partakers of Eternal Salvation.

Notice taken how Christ would take care of the safety of His People in those times of trouble, that were at hand. In this Verse there is another Angel spoken of, <HI>I saw another Angel,</HI> (says the Apo∣stle) an Angel that did differ from those Seven that had the Trumpets given to them; this Angel heard the Prayers of all the Saints of God in the World, and He did offer <HI>Incense;</HI> which shows, that thereby Christ and He only is intended. The Angel here mentioned did offer In∣cense upon the <HI>Golden Altar,</HI> which was before the Throne. This has respect to what was customary among the Children of Israel, there was an Altar of Incense, a Golden Altar which the Priest did of∣fer Incense upon; and that Altar is said to be <HI>before the Throne,</HI> because it was before the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> which was said to be the Throne of God.

<P>This is a Scripture Truth, a Mystery that is not known but only by the Scrip∣tures, and by revelation from the Spirit of God. The Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament do bear Witness to it. In the Old Testament we read of Christs Intercession for His People. Zec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1. 12. <HI>The Angel of the Lord said, how long shall it be, O Lord, of Hosts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re thou have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the Cities of Judah, against which thou hast bad indigna∣tion; and the Lord answered the Angel with good &amp; comfortable words.</HI> That An∣gel was the very same with the Angel in my Text, expressed in verse 11. by the Man that stood among the Myrtle Trees. This Truth is more abundantly declared in the Scriptures of the New Testament, where we often read concerning the <HI>In∣tercession</HI> of Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Rom. 8. 34. <HI>He is at the Right hand of God, and maketh intercession for us.</HI> Hence Christ is said to be an <HI>Advocate.</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 1. <HI>If

The Ad∣versary of the Saints of God, is the De∣vil, who does accuse them; and some∣times very falsely, as we see in that in∣stance of <HI>Job;</HI> and sometimes he has matter for his accusation; but then <HI>Je∣sus Christ, the righteous Advocate,</HI> does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> His Servants, He pleads for them when Satan does accuse them, and plead against them; This we see, <HI>Zech.</HI> 3. 1, 2. <HI>Joshua</HI> the High Priest, stood before the Angel of the Lord, and he was Clothed with filthy Garments, and there stood <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at his Right Hand.</HI> The accuser was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to stand at the Right Hand; so Satan is represented as standing at the Right Hand of Joshua; the Angel of the Lord, which is Christ, said, <HI>The Lord re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke thee Satan, is not this a brand pluck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of the Fire.</HI> He is but newly brought out of Babylon, if something of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Garments of Babylon, is still up∣on him, that is not so much to be won∣dered at.

of Raim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt.</HI> Thus Christ is an Advocate for His People. And there were Typical Intercessors of old, among the People of God, which had respect to what Christ would be and do. Thus <HI>Moses</HI> was a Typical Intercessor, Psal. 106. 23. <HI>Moses stood before him in the breach, to turn a∣way his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</HI> God had destroyed them, had not Mo∣ses ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in, and by His Intercession pre∣vented; and we see how it was, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Moses</HI> fell down before God, when the People had grievously Sinned and pro∣voked God to destroy them. God had threatned to consume them in a moment.

Jesus Christ. Again, The <HI>High Priest</HI> was a singular Type of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> The Priest was to offer Sacrifice; then to enter into the Sanctuary, there to offer <HI>Incense.</HI> Thus Christ has offered Him∣self a Sacrifice, has not done that only, but has entered into the Sanctuary, into the holy place, and there He offers In∣cense. It is said, Heb. 8. 4. <HI>Is he to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earth, he should not be a Priest.</HI> Why? the Priest did not his office compleatly, if he did not after he offered Sacrifice, enter into the holy place of offer In∣tense: so (says the Apostle) Christ would not be a Priest, would not do His work fully, if He had not gone to Heaven, to offer Incense after He had offered Him∣self a Sacrifice for His People. Thus Christ is an <HI>Intercessor</HI> for His People, and He ever will be so, even to the end of the World. Heb. 7. 21. <HI>He is a Priest for ever, after the order of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chisedeck.</HI> Ver. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>He ever liveth to make Intercessi∣on.</HI> So that He continues to be an In∣tercessor on the behalf of His People, even throughout all Ages of the World.

manner as in His Estate of Humiliation He did; but He intercedes as becomes His state in Glory: We see the pattern of it, Joh. 17. 24. <HI>Father I will,</HI> that those whom thou hast given me, be with me, to behold my Glory. <HI>I will,</HI> Christ Intercedes as one that makes a Legal demand, that what He has bought and paid for, should be granted unto Him.</P>

As the High Priest when He entered into the Holiest of all, had the Names of all the Tribes of Israel on his Breast; so now that Christ is in the Holy of Holies, He has the Names of all the Elect of God writ∣ten on His Heart.

We have a remarkable Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cerning this, Isa. 53. 12. <HI>He made Intercession for the transgressors.</HI> That Scripture was gloriously fulfilled, when Christ interceded for those heinous <HI>transgressors,</HI> that Crucified Him. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gged for them, that God would for∣give them; and God did forgive many of them. Some of those very Men that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a hand in Crucifying our Lord Jesus Christ, they were Converted and their Sins were forgiven. We find, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. <HI>Peter</HI> said to those Jews, you have with wicked hands Crucified Him, whom God hath made both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this they were wicked in their heart, they Repented, they did seek to God for pardoning Mer∣cy and were pardoned. Here then was a wonderful fruit of the <HI>Intercession</HI> of

Christ for His Elect, before they ever did Believe. The Lord says, Psal. 2. 8. <HI>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</HI> The Hea∣then Nations have been given to Christ, Whole Nations of Heathens have been Converted to Christ. The <HI>Roman Empire</HI> of <HI>Pagan</HI> became professedly <HI>Christian.</HI> Here is the reason of it, Christ's Interce∣ding that it might be so.

give to them the things they humbly Pray and seek unto Him for. We find when the People were Praying <HI>without</HI> the Sanctuary, then the Priest was Of∣fering Incense within. <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 10. We Read of <HI>Zacharias</HI> the Priest, that he did offer Incense on the Altar; and that then the People were Praying without. And doubtless there is an Allusion to that in the first Verse of this Eighth Chapter of the Revelations, where it is said, <HI>There was silence in Heaven for the space of half an hour.</HI> Thus it was a∣mong the Jews, when they were offer∣ing Sacrifices, there was not silence; but the Temple rang with Musick while the Sacrifices were offering; but after they offered Sacrifice, Incense was offered, <HI>then all was silent.</HI> So then, Christ in Heaven is Interceding for His People, that their Prayers may be heard. When they are Praying on Earth out of the Holy Place, then He is Interceding with God before the Throne in Heaven; and the very things they Pray for, Christ does desire on their behalf, that those things may be granted to them. He de∣sires they may have those things which
<PB N="109" REF="002053_0115_0FBA8B58D2CB0518"/>
are the main Petitions that they present to God. As now, Believers Pray to God that they may be kept from Sinning a∣gainst Him, that of all evils they may be preserved from Sin, that is the request of all true Believers: Christ has made that Prayer on their behalf, Joh. 17. 15. <HI>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the World:</HI> that is, before they have done all the work thou hast appointed for them; but <HI>I pray that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</HI> What is <HI>the evil?</HI> Sin is the evil of evils, the greatest of evils; now Christ Prays for Believers, that they may be kept from that, that no Sin may ever prove a ruining iniquity to them, and it will be granted. Believers Pray that they may have Grace to perse∣vere, that they may hold on in the way God has commanded them to walk in; that is a special request which all true Believers earnestly present to God, that they may hold on to the end, may never turn aside from God: and Christ has made the same request to God, that they may <HI>Persevere</HI> in the way of holy Obedience to Him. He said to <HI>Peter,</HI> Luk. 22. 31. Satan has desired to sift you, but <HI>I have
<PB N="110" REF="002053_0116_0FBA8B5A1EF0C2D8"/>
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</HI> The faith of the true Believer shall never fail, tho' as to the actings, and the exer∣cise of it, there may be a failing, yet as to the habit of faith, that shall never fail; when the Grace of Faith is really wrought in a Soul it shall never fail. The Believers is like a Tree that may be shaken by the wind, but is never pluck'd up by the roots: So the wind of temptation may shake the Believer grievously sometimes, but his root of Faith shall abide fast and firm. Belie∣vers Pray that they may be brought safe to Heaven at the last; and Christ has interceded with God that it may be so. Christ has said, <HI>I will that they be with me where I am that they may behold my glory.</HI> They Pray that their Salvation may be carried on to a glorious perfection; and Christ in Heaven does intercede for them that it may be so. Rom. 5. 10. <HI>We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be sa∣ved by his life.</HI> Saved, that is, our Sal∣vation perfected, by His Life, by His li∣ving to be an Intercessor, So Christ in Heaven intercedes for Believers that
<PB N="111" REF="002053_0117_0FBA8B5D1E54EC50"/>
they may be brought safe thither, that their Salvation may be carried on to the highest degree and perfection, which is intimated, Heb. 7. 25. <HI>He is able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him, since he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</HI> Save to the uttermost, that is to say, the Salvation of Believers is car∣ried on to a most glorious perfection, there shall be nothing wanting. And why? Christ ever lives to make Inter∣cession. Thus we see what Believers Pray for themselves, Christ Prays with them, presents the same desire before God that they present to him.</P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>As Christ does intercede for Believers, so it is on the account of His Me∣rit, and Mediation, that their Prayers are accepted with God.</HI> The Prayers of Be∣lievers are very acceptable to God, He takes delight in hearing them. <HI>David</HI> therefore said, <HI>Let my prayer be as incense.</HI> Incense was a sweet perfume, very de∣lightful to the senses; let my Prayer be so, sayes David. The reason why the Prayers of Believers are so, is because of <HI>the much incense that cometh out of the
<PB N="112" REF="002053_0118_0FBA8B5EAD6A7700"/>
Angels hand.</HI> Hence the Prayers of the Saints are so grateful to God: alas! there is many times that in their Prayers which is unsavory, that He might say to them, Your incense is an abomination to me; and threaten them as He did the Jews, <HI>I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</HI> God might say so of our Prayers that have so much sinful Infir∣mities in them, and in the best of them too: How come they then to be so ac∣ceptable to God? It is because of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> He by His Incense does take away the ill savour of our Prayers, and does present to God, that, that is highly plea∣sing to Him. It is therefore said, Rev. 5. 8. <HI>There were golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of Saints.</HI> Golden vials; there were Censers made of Gold that the <HI>Incense</HI> was put into: the Pray∣ers of Saints are very <HI>Odoriferous,</HI> very pleasing to God. How comes that to pass? It is because Christ Intercedes <HI>with them and for them.</HI> Christs Intercession will always prevail. Whatever Christ does ask for, it will certainly be granted. Suppose the thing to be never so Mira∣culous. Did He not say to <HI>Peter, If I
<PB N="113" REF="002053_0119_0FBA8B6023A248B0"/>
would pray to my Father for it, He would presently send an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my of Angels to de∣send</HI> my twelve Disciples: Yea, twelve Ligions of them, as many as made a Ro∣men Army, and more if I would but pray for it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. And did He not say to God? Joh. 11. 42. <HI>I know that thou bearest me always.</HI> What Christ does Intercede for it is always accepted with God. That His Intercession is prevalent, and shall be regarded, and answered, is evident from several things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Intercession</HI> of a special favou∣rite is regarded. When <HI>Esther</HI> was high∣ly in favour with the King of Persia, he said to her, F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th. 5. 3. <HI>Queen Esther, what is thy petition, and it shall be granted.</HI> Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is highly in favour with the King of Heaven, the King of all the World, and what He does Intercede for will surely be granted. God never did deny Him any thing, never will deny Him any thing: He is infinitely dear to God, therefore shall not go with a denial. Isai. 42. 1. <HI>Behold mine Elect in whom my soul delighteth.</HI> The very Soul of God does delight in the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> therefore He will grant what He re∣quests.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="114" REF="002053_0120_0FBA8B62E56BE138"/>2. It is evidently so, If we consider the Relation Christ does stand in towards God. Sometimes a faithful Servant has a great interest in his lord, and will be heard in what he requests. We read concerning the Centurion, <HI>Luke</HI> 7. 2. That he had a <HI>Servant sick who was dear to him.</HI> Never was any Servant so dear to his Master, as Christ is to God: Christ as Mediator is Gods Servant, and the best and dearest Servant that ever the God of Heaven had; the most Wise, the most Prudent Servant, that ever God had, Isai. 52. 13. <HI>Behold my Servant shall deal pru∣dently.</HI> And He is a most Faithful Ser∣vant. It is said of <HI>Moses,</HI> he was faith∣ful to him that appointed him: but <HI>Christ is more worthy than Moses.</HI> There∣fore God did commit to Christ all His Elect. He trusted Him with all His Elect, and Christ did faithfully take care of them all. Joh. 17. 12. <HI>Of those thou hast given to me, I have lost none,</HI> saith Christ. The Elect of God that are given to Him, He will not lose any One of them. God has trusted Him with them, and He will be faithful. Christ is dear to God, not only as a Servant, but as a Son. <HI>We be∣hold
<PB N="115" REF="002053_0121_0FBA8B6500742278"/>
his glory as the glory of the only begot∣ten of the father,</HI> Joh. 1. 14. God has ma∣ny adopted Sons, but One <HI>Own Son,</HI> Christ is His <HI>only begotten Son.</HI> There came a voice from Heaven and that more than once, when our Saviour submitted to Baptism, and when with His Disciples on the holy Mount, He was transfigured, that voice came from Heaven, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</HI> God delights in Him more than in any One else, more than in all the Creatures in the World; all the Angels in Hea∣ven are not so dear to God as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is.</P>
<P N="3">3. CHRIST has purchased what He Intercedes for. Purchas'd it with the Price of His own Blood, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 12. He is gone <HI>not without blood</HI> into the holy Place, He is gone to Heaven with the Merit of His blood, and pleads that before God continually: He has deserved what He asks for. The Altar of Incense had blood Sprinkled upon it, this signifying that <HI>Je∣sus Christ</HI> Intercedes by vertue of His blood. The high Priest after He offered Sacrifice once in a Year, did enter into the holiest of all, and there <HI>Sprinkled blood
<PB N="116" REF="002053_0122_0FBA8B6625F675C8"/>
on the mercy seat,</HI> teaching us that God is become Merciful to us through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and that Christ Intercedes on the account of what His blood has Merited; that He desires nothing at the hand of Mercy but what He has Purchased at the hand of Justice. We may then be sure what Christ Intercedes for in behalf of His Elect, shall be graciously answered. For the blood of Christ is Infinitely Me∣ritorious, because it is <HI>the blood of God:</HI> Not the blood of a meer Man, but of One who is God as well as Man. So the Scripture expressly declares to us, Acts 20. 28. <HI>The Church of God which he has pur∣chased with his own blood.</HI> God with His own blood, that is Christ who is God. He is also Man, so was capable of shedding blood, as <HI>God Man</HI> He has Merited what He has shed His blood for: the blood of Christ has a powerful Voice. <HI>We are come to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things than the blood of Abel.</HI> Abel, his blood cryed for Vengeance, but the blood of Christ cries for Mercy on the behalf of Believers, of those, which this blood by the hand of faith is sprinkled on, it crys and sayes, Let this Sinner be
<PB N="117" REF="002053_0123_0FBA8B67CF6F56F8"/>
forgiven, notwithstanding all his Sins he has been guilty of, let him be saved E∣ternally; then it must needs be so. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then what Christ Intercedes for shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> granted. We see the Doctrine cleared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opened in the particulars mentioned.</P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>We should make sure that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those for whom Christ does Intercede.</HI> Then happy are we, considering Christs Intercession always prevails: and what does He Intercede for? Joh. 17. 17. <HI>Sanctifie them through thy truth.</HI> That Grace may be given to His Elect. Christ Prays that Sanctifying Grace may be gi∣ven to His Elect: And as for Believers who are Sanctified, it is His Prayer that they may be more Sanctified, that more Grace may be given to them. Are not those happy Men, happy Women, concerning whom this is true? Surely they are. Christ Prays that they <HI>may be where he is,</HI> and He is ascended into Heaven: He is gone to the Father, there∣fore gone that He may prepare a Place for them. Christ by His Intercession does prepare a Place in Heaven for all true Believers on His Name. It is true,
<PB N="118" REF="002053_0124_0FBA8B6CD9F99CC8"/>
there are some subjects of Christs Inter∣cession that cannot know they are so, Namely, the Elect of God while Uncon∣verted; but there are others may know Christ is Interceding for them, Namely, true Believers may know that Christ In∣tercedes for them, by their having <HI>the Spirit of Prayer;</HI> if they have the Spirit of Prayer it is certain Christ does Inter∣cede for them. Joh. 14. 16. <HI>I will pray the Father and he will send you another comfor∣ter, even the spirit of truth.</HI> If God has sent his Spirit into our hearts, making Intercession, <HI>in us,</HI> we may know Christ is Interceding <HI>for us</HI> before the Throne of God in Heaven. The Apostle says, We know not what to Pray for as we ought, but the Spirit of God maketh In∣tercession <HI>in us</HI> with groans that cannot be uttered, If we have the Spirit of God making Intercession <HI>in us,</HI> we may believe, we should believe, Christ is In∣terceding <HI>for us.</HI> Indeed Men may practice the duty of Prayer, yet not have the Spirit of Prayer; yea, a Man may have the gift of Prayer, able to Pray an hour or two, yet not have the Spirit of Prayer. Zech. 12. 10. <HI>I will pour the spirit of grace and supplication,</HI> upon the
<PB N="119" REF="002053_0125_0FBA8B6DA1770440"/>
house of David. If there is a Spirit of supplication, there is Grace wrought in the Soul. The Spirit of Prayer, What is it? It implies a continual Inclination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prayer; a Man that has the Spirit of Prayer, cannot for his Life live without Prayer; if he has been from God a while he cannot be at rest till he go to God a∣gain. The Spirit of Prayer makes a Man desire chiefly Spiritual blessings; Nay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God should put him to his choice, Tell Me what thou wouldst have, Earthly or Heavenly good things, He says, Let me have Spiritual blessings; he Prays that God would give His Spirit to him; and will not God give His Spirit to them that ask it? We are sure He will. When a Man does desire that Christs Interest may prevail in the World, rather than any thing else; a Man that seeks in the first place the Kingdom of God, that is the Man that has the Spirit of Prayer, and may know Christ Intercedes for him.</P>
<P>USE, II. The other <HI>Use</HI> is <HI>a word of Encouragement to practise this Duty of Prayer.</HI> Seeing we have an <HI>Intercessor in Heaven</HI> that presents our requests to
<PB N="120" REF="002053_0126_0FBA8B6F1E62DAB8"/>
God, that is encouragement enough to this duty. And <HI>what should we pray for</HI> We should Pray that the Interest of Christ may prevail in the World. In the Printed <HI>Proclamation</HI> for this day, We are directed to Pray, <HI>That the Interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ may prevail all the World over.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ Intercedes for us, it is most rea∣sonable that we should Intercede for His Interest. <HI>Psal.</HI> 72. 15. It is said concerning Solomon, <HI>Prayer shall be made for him con∣tinually.</HI> Christ is the <HI>Solomon</HI> there in∣tended. Why, are we to Pray for Christ? Certainly He needs none of our Prayers who is blessed for ever; we are not to Pray for His Person, but for His Kingdom, that His Interest may prevail every where; that we are the rather to Pray for, because there are Prophesies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the written word of God that such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Day shall come. Dan. 2. 35. <HI>The little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall become a great Mountain, and fill the whole Earth.</HI> There is a promise of the enlargement of Christs Kingdom, that it shall fill the whole Earth. We should be the more fervent in Prayer for this, because the Time draws on a pace. I don't doubt, but there are some here
<PB N="121" REF="002053_0127_0FBA8B7204772488"/>
living will see the beginning of those glorious days, that are Promiss'd concer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the Church of God. We read of <HI>Daniel,</HI> that when he knew by Books the time for the deliverance from Captivity was at hand, he set himself to Pray with fasting. When we know the Time for the enlargement of Christs Kingdom is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hand, wè should set our selves more fervently to Pray that it may be so. And truely if there be a Spirit of Prayer on that account, That will be a blessed sign that the time is near. And it must needs the near, for it is said, When <HI>the Seventh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished.</HI> The Mystery of God, is the glorious Kingdom Christ shall pos∣ses in this lower World; and it is past doubt, we are come to the close of <HI>the Sixth Trumpet.</HI> Well then, <HI>the Seventh Trumpet</HI> will sound in a little time, then behold what is said; it is said, Rev. 11. 15. <HI>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever &amp; ever.</HI> Therefore let us Pray, that it may be so; we don't know what God may bring out of the present Commotions &amp; Shakings of Na∣tions:
<PB N="122" REF="002053_0128_0FBA8B73B6DCFF88"/>
This we know, before those glori∣ous Times come there will be dark and dismal times, terrible shakings of Nati∣ons &amp; Kingdoms. The Lord has said, <HI>I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come into his Temple.</HI> What God will bring out of the present sha∣kings, is known to Himself; if there be a Spirit of Prayer, that will cause shakings to be among the Nations. It is said in the Context before us, after the Prayers of the Saints with the much Incense gi∣ven, There were <HI>Thundrings and Light∣nings, &amp; an Earthquake.</HI> Some have sup∣posed that there was a Notable fulfill∣ment of that Scripture, by what was done in the days of the Emperor <HI>Theodo∣sius,</HI> He with his Army was surrounded with Heathen Enemies, before he would give them Battel, He fell down on his Knees at the head of his Army, Prayed earnestly to God to be with him: God sent Thunder &amp; Lightning, and an horrible Tempest, which beat back the Weapons of the Enemies upon themselves, &amp; gave him a glorious Victory: that Victory made a Mighty <HI>Revolution</HI> in the World. We should Pray then that <HI>the true Reli∣gion</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="002053_0129_0FBA8B756F877718"/>
may prevail in the World, because the Kingdom of Christ does consist very much in True Religion. There is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> true Religion, the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> is the only true Religion: in the Christi∣an Religion, the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> is the only true Religion. As for <HI>Papists,</HI> they belong to the Kingdom of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> not to the Kingdom of Christ; they are wicked Idolaters, such if any in the World are Enemies to Christ: We should Pray against that Interest. It is matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> humiliation that of late Years the Protestant Religion has been decaying, and the Popish Interest on the growing hand. So in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> where for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Generations the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> was a Protestant, now he is a Papist. In <HI>Poland</HI> of late there have been severe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against all <HI>Protestants.</HI> In <HI>Saxony,</HI> that Duke (whose Progenitor was the first Prince that embraced the Protestant Religion) that so he might be capable of being a King of <HI>Poland,</HI> has renounced the Protestant, and espoused the Popish Religion; and we are informed that this last Year his Son has done the like. We likewise hear that in <HI>Hungary,</HI> Protestants
<PB N="124" REF="002053_0130_0FBA8B76D9184160"/>
are Persecuted. Also that those Places which in the late War were taken from the <HI>Turks,</HI> are put into the hands of <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI> who are worse &amp; more bloody than the <HI>Turks. Luther</HI> advised the Emperor of Germany, that he should make War rather against the <HI>Pope</HI> than the <HI>Turk,</HI> as being the greatest Enemy in the World to the Kingdom of Christ. We ought to Praise God who has given our Nation a <HI>Protestant King,</HI> whose Ancestors have ever been Protestants. His Royal Grand∣Mother famous for her Piety, dyed in Exile for her Religion. His Grand-Fa∣ther was deprived of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia</HI> for His being a Protestant. Be∣hold how God has rewarded Him, in be∣stowing Three Kingdoms on His Grand∣Son, our King <HI>GEORGE.</HI> And this National Mercy is the greater, in that divers of our late Kings were not so. One called Himself a Protestant, that was a Papist: Another renounced the Protestant Religion, and designed to restore <HI>Rome</HI> a∣gain in <HI>England.</HI> What came of it? Truly the curse of <HI>Joshua</HI> fell upon him. Joshua cursed the Man that should go to re∣build the Walls of Jericho, cursed that
<PB N="125" REF="002053_0131_0FBA8B794717B450"/>
Man and His Children. So that King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> went to build the <HI>Romish Jericho,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>JESUS</HI> has fallen on him and to his Family, <HI>Josh.</HI> 6. 26. Since God has given us a Protestant King, we ought to Pray much for Him. It is said of One of the Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> when he gave en∣couragement to build the Temple, they were to Pray for the Life of the King, and of his Sons, <HI>Ezra</HI> 6. 10. Thus our King has given encouragement to build the Tem∣ple, we should Pray for Him for His Life, and Pray for His Family. And when we Pray for our Nation, shall we not Pray for our selves, for poor distress'd <HI>New∣England.</HI> It is well that we have begun the Year with solemn Prayer. If the Harvest should fail, what a Miserable condition shall we be in? If we have Showers from Heaven, it is God that gives them. God says, Zech. 10. 1. <HI>Ask of the Lord rain,</HI> and he will give you Showers of Rain. What shall be done that we may be delivered out of the grie∣vous distresses upon us? Alas! for the Sins of <HI>New-England.</HI> Alas! for the Sins of <HI>Boston;</HI> What unreasonable Oppressi∣on is in the midst of us? The Merchant
<PB N="126" REF="002053_0132_0FBA8B7BDEBE8778"/>
Oppressing the People in the Country, the People in the Country Oppressing the People in <HI>Boston:</HI> but who does the Op∣pression chiefly fall upon? Not so much upon the Rich, as upon the poor; the poor are like to be crushed to death Alas! that there are the Sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> among us! Many in <HI>Boston</HI> are guilty of the Sins of <HI>Sodom.</HI> Is there not <HI>Pride?</HI> Poor People will go beyond their rank, &amp; beyond their ability, which is a great iniquity, and very provoking to God. <HI>Fullness of bread,</HI> and of drink, great a∣buse that way; Drunkenness is become a common Sin among us. <HI>Abundance of Idleness:</HI> There is not that Industry a∣mong us as ought to be. How many spend their Time in Taverns; if they spent their Time Industrously, they might live comfortably. When as there are too ma∣ny, that their Wives &amp; Children are pe∣rishing at home, when they are Idling in Taverns or Publick houses. Alas! Sin∣ful <HI>Boston,</HI> dost thou not see, that Poverty is coming on thee like an armed Man, and that many of thy Houses will be for∣saken and left desolate. Now the great question is, What shall we do that we 
<PB N="127" REF="002053_0133_0FBA8B7D604BD668"/>
may be extricated out of our difficulties? You say, Blessed is the Man that can tell us what should be done. Some say that if an old Law of the Colony were revi∣ved, That no Merchant should ask above Four Pence, or Six Pence in the Shilling for what he Sells, that would bring Mo∣ney into the Country, and save the Land from ruine. That's a matter out of my Province to meddle with. I have nothing to say about it, but I can tell you of a∣nother thing that must be done, and if it be done, God will deliver <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> out of the dismal straights and difficulties that are upon us: The thing to be done is, to <HI>Repent and Pray.</HI> Don't think Praying alone will do with∣out Repentance, without Reforming and Returning to the Lord; but if you do that, I can assure you in His Name, He will deliver you out of your distresses. I will bring you a plain Scripture for it. Jer. 18. 7, 8. <HI>At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, &amp; concerning a King∣dom, to destroy it; if that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI> Well then, let there be
<PB N="128" REF="002053_0134_0FBA8B7EE0E3DC60"/>
that Repenting, that Returning to the Lord that He now expects from us, and we may be sure of it, God will be as good as His Word, and turn from His Anger, and be pleased with us: Only do it with∣out delay; don't put it off till hereafter, Remember the words of the Prophet: Zeph. 2. 3. <HI>Seek the Lord ye meek of the earth,</HI> before the decree bring forth; <HI>Seek righteousness, seek meekness, it may be ye shall be bid in the day of the Lords anger.</HI> Be in earnest with God. And I will con∣clude with the words of a Martyr, <HI>Pray, Pray, Pray, never more need than now.</HI></P>
