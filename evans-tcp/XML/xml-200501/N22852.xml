<P>THIS little Treatise was first published in London, where the demand for it was so great, that in a few weeks it went through several editions; this, together with the favourable character given it by the London Reviewers, and the respectability of its publishers, places the practica∣bility of the author's system in a favourable point of view. It is the avowed intention of the author,
<Q>to serve the labouring part of mankind, and to render their situa∣tion more comfortable by a considerable reduction of their domestic expenses.</Q></P>
<P>In preparing this edition for the press, the Editor has endeavoured to second the views of the author, he has made considerable additions, which he has from the best authorities, and by arranging it under distinct heads, he has rendered it more simple and perspicuous without in∣juring the author's style or sentiment. Those wishing to compare the present edition with the original, may have an opportunity by applying at the Philadelphia Library, where a copy of each is deposited.</P>

<HEAD><HI>TREATISE</HI> ON <HI>BREWING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has always been the fate of Persons, who des∣pising private interest, had no object in view but the public good, to meet with a host of enemies; Prejudice, interest, influence, and a thousand other obstacles oppose their endeavours, and nothing but the conviction of truth could effectually secure their success. The author of this small tract, cannot therefore expect to escape his share of obloquy and defamation, for exerting his small abilities to serve the labouring part of mankind, and to render their situations more comfortable by a considerable reduc∣tion of their domestic expences.</P>
<P>The natural constitution of man, requires a por∣tion of liquid aliment to assist digestion and nutri∣tion; and the hard-working class of the Community, receive from it support, spirits and strength; it is no wonder then, that the ingenuity of man has been exerted to produce liquors at once pleasant to the palate, reviving to the spirits, and productive of support. <HI>Gin, Brandy, Rum, Wine, Ale, Cyder, Mum, Perry,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. are proofs of the amaz∣ing invention of man to supply the defects of na∣ture; but, for celebrity, universal use and estima∣tion Porter has not been equalled by any other liquor. The method of producing this beverage, and the ingredients of which it is composed, have been long kept an impenetrable secret; if we consider the im∣mense profits accruing from this secrecy, which the perusal of this Treatise will prove incontrovertibly to any one, it will only be matter of wonder that any person should disclose it to the public; and indeed had the author a private interest to serve, he could more profitably promote it by allowing the public still to be blinded, and the veil of mystery to remain unremoved from the art of Porter Brewing; but re∣gardless
<PB N="6" REF="030189_0003_0FE503A4C3BEB998"/>
of interested censure, or prejudiced dislike, he determines to exert his small powers, for the gene∣ral benefit of society, and particularly for the lower classes. He is neither influenced by envy at those who have made fortunes by the secrets here exposed, no by any private wish of particular gain to himself, but by a desire to soften the hardships of the industri∣ous poor; and in this point of view, he trusts the candid and impartial will consider his book, as one step attempted to ameliorate the condition of the labouring part of mankind.</P>
<P>The intention of this treatise, is to induce the Tradesman, the Artizan, and the Mechanic, to turn their attention to the possibility of supplying themselves and families, with a beverage much cheap∣er, and more nutritive than Porter, and yet retaining all its good qualities, and excluding its noxious ones. This may be done in the smallest families, in the smallest quantities and with the fewest conveniences, at little more than one third of the present expence of Porter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="estimate of profits">
<HEAD>Estimate of the profits arising to families and others from brewing their own Porter, Ale, and Beer.</HEAD>
<P>The following calculations are taken from one quarter <HI>(eight Bushels)</HI> of malt, but they, together with the following receipts may be reduced in their proportions to a single peck, or multiplyed to a thou∣sand, by considering the tables of Ale and Beer mea∣sure, allowing the Ale 32 Gallons and the Beer 36 Gallons to the barrel.</P>
<P>A quarter of malt with all the ingredients to make good Porter, exclusive of time and trouble, cost about 14 ½ dollars, which will produce 5 barrels of Porter, which may be sold to the inn-keeper, at 11 dollars per barrel equal to 55 dollars, or to families in wholesale at 1 ½ dollar per dozen of bot∣tles equal to 90 dollars, which retailed by the pub∣lican at 25 cents per bottle, amounts to 36 dollars per. barrel or 180 dollars for the produce of one quarter of malt,—so that the tradesman, mechanic,
<PB N="7" REF="030189_0003_0FE503A4C3BEB998"/>
or artificer, whose family consumes in progress of time 5 barrels of porter, pays 180 dollars for what with the oeconomy of his own care and his wife's atten∣tion he may be supplyed with at only 14 ½ dollars.</P>
<P>This calculation is deduced from the current prices of London porter.</P>
<P>The author of this Treatise, has brewed Porter for his own consumption several years; he is there∣fore intimately acquainted with every article which the brewing of Porter requires. He pretends not to say that all Porter brewers follow the same receipt, the principal articles it contains are essential to Por∣ter, and though in Britain Acts of Parliament have expressly forbid the use of several of them, yet the author can affirm from experience, that he could ne∣ver produce the present flavoured Porter without them.</P>
<P>If any person will make trial of the Receipt, he will then be enabled to judge whether all Porter brewers do or do not make use of prohibited articles; it is only sufficient to observe, however much they may surprize, however pernicious or disagreeable they may appear, the Author has always found them requisites in the Brewing of Porter, and thinks they must invariably be used by those who wish to continue the taste, flavour and appearance which they have been accustomed to.</P>
<P>The following statement of the ingredients, and their average prices are sufficient to convince the most incredulous of the truth of the foregoing Calculations.</P>

<P>From this candid and open statement of the arti∣cles used in Porter, every person may adopt the plan proposed by this Treatise of brewing for him∣self. It will naturally happen, that those who are unacquainted with the mysteries of Porter brewing will be surprised at some of the articles, but for their information I will follow the receipts with a particular description of each article, that every per∣son may chuse his own ingredients, and increase or decrease their proportions, as may best suit his taste, opinion or convenience.—</P>
<P>For the benefit of those who live in lodgings, I shall add a calculation for 1 peck of Malt.—</P>

<P>In the above receipt the Ale is brewed from the first, and the Beer from the second mash of the malt; 1 ¼ lb. of the hops is used to the Ale, to which is added the other ¾ lb. of fresh hops for the Beer. If the ope∣ration is rightly conducted and the water good, there will be a hogshead of as good Ale, and another of Beer, as any person could desire for family use, perfectly free from all intoxicative and bad qualities.</P>
<P>Having thus completed the general receipts, before we proceed to describe the operations of brewing, it may not be amiss to promote general knowledge, to give a slight sketch of the properties of each article, that every person may choose his own ingredients, and increase or decrease their various proportions, as may best suit his taste, opinion or convenience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of ingredients">
<HEAD>A Particular description of the Ingredients necessary in Brewing Porter, Beer, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MALT is the well known farenacious grain barley, prepared by particular operations called malting; these preliminary operations accelerate the process of fermentation, which in a state of barley it would not
<PB N="12" REF="030189_0006_0FE4FD04B89EB488"/>
be susceptible of. It is a wholesome nutricious grain, containing a soft balsamic, oleaginous essence, highly agreeable to the palate, and healthful to the constitu∣tion, but by no means intoxicative except when used in large quantities. The intoxicating qualities of Porter and Beer are to be ascribed to the various drugs in∣termixed with them; it is evident that some Porter, Beer, &amp;c. is more heady than others, and it arises from the greater or less quantity of stupefactive ingredients. Malt to produce intoxication must be used in such large quantities as would very much diminish the brewer's profit.</P>
<P>Malt is made of three different kinds, which differ only in a greater or less degree of firing or dryness; they are known by the names of <HI>pale, amber,</HI> and <HI>brown</HI> malt. The reason for using these three sorts is to attain a peculiar flavour and colour.</P>
<P>Pale malt is most nutritive, being (from the tender method of drying it) nearest to the original barley-corn; it likewise contains more of the alcalous and balsamic qualities; it is used to brew Ale and Beer.</P>
<P>Amber malt, is that which is dried in a middle degree between pale and brown, and is now much in use, be∣ing the most pleasant and free of either extreme; it is the most wholesome, and I would recommend to use no∣thing else.</P>
<P>Brown malt is sometimes so crusted and burnt by the great degree of heat which it endures in the kiln, that its mealy part loses a great share of its essential salts, and vital properties; it is oftenest used to make Porter.</P>
<P>As country brewers, farmers, &amp;c. generally make their own malt, which augments about one half more in the process of malting, I have therefore in my cal∣culations rated the malt at the value of barley, allowing the overplus to pay the trouble of malting.</P>
<P>HOPS are an aromatic grateful bitter, very whole∣some, and undoubtedly efficacious in giving both flavour and strength to the liquor.</P>
<P>They are essentially necessary to check and keep the fermentation regular, which without the assistance of Hops would proceed so far as to produce Vinegar
<PB N="13" REF="030189_0006_0FE4FD04B89EB488"/>
instead of <HI>Beer.</HI> With regard to the quantity of Hops, every person may suit his palate or convenience; 4 lb. to 8 lb. is the common proportion to a quarter of malt: But if the Porter, Beer, &amp;c. is brewed in warm weather or intended to be kept long, the quan∣tity of hops must be encreased.</P>
<P>When the hops are dear, numbers for other bitters have been used, as the herb <HI>Horehound, Daucus</HI> or wild carrot seed, <HI>Wormwood, &amp;c.</HI> none of them however, comes up to the Hop of a good flavour, although an extract of wormwood makes a tolerable substitute, particularly for Porter.</P>
<P>YEAST is necessary to aid the fermentation, by giving the liquor that portion of elastic air, of which the boiling deprives it. One quarter of malt made into strong Beer requires 6 pints of yeast, and the same quantity made into common Beer requires 8 pints of yeast to ferment it; the hotter the worts are when the yeast is added, they require the less. Yeast is of a very intoxicating nature and produces bad con∣sequences to the stomach, if the Beer is not properly worked, for without fermentation or working, no Must or worts, however rich are intoxicative. Yeast may be kept for two or three months, if the weather is not too hot, by covering it with cold water, which should be frequently renewed, or some of the thickest yeast may be bottled, in which state it will keep longer. There is another more simple method of preserving yeast, practiced by many families in Scot∣land, who brew their own Beer; it is only putting a whisk, broom, or branch of juniper or furze into the worts during the time they are working, then hang∣ing it in a dry place, in this manner yeast may be pre∣served ten or twelve months.</P>
<P>TREACLE or molasses, partakes of many of the pro∣perties of liquorice; is a laxative, and inclines to gentle perspiration, by thus promoting the natural secretions, it must be a principal means of rendering Porter and Beer in general wholesome and healthy. Treacle is also a cheaper article than sugar, and an∣swers the purposes of colour, where the Beer is in∣tended
<PB N="14" REF="030189_0007_0FE50382E38DC2C8"/>
for immediate consumption; but in summer where a body is required to withstand the tempera∣ture of the air, and the draught is not so quick; sugar alone can give body to Porter. Treacle may there∣fore be used or not at discretion.</P>
<P>LIQUORICE ROOT and SPANISH LIQUORICE are of the same quality, they are pleasant and wholesome, keep the body gently laxative, and oppose the costive quality of some of the other ingredients; they ought therefore to be used. Porter is said to feed people; to incline to corpulency nothing is more necessary than to keep the body regular, and therefore liquorice is doubtless one of the most salutary ingredients of Porter, carrying off the pernicious effects of the other compounds, and producing that regular habit which is the foundation of corpulency.—Remember to bruise the liquorice root.</P>
<P>SUGAR is a pleasant nutritive extract, and forms the main body of Beer, when boiled to a proper temper for <HI>essentia,</HI> and for what is called <HI>colour,</HI> it answers both for malt and hops, the one being an agreeable sweet, and the other a pleasant bitter. Sugar is likewise a keeper of Beer, and gives it that substance which im∣proves with age; it is a cheap substitute for malt, 6 lb. of sugar being equal to one bushel of malt; the use of sugar in brewing is expresly prohibited in Bri∣tain by act of Parliament, but in the United States no such arbitrary restriction is in force. The editor would therefore recommend it to the attention of those concerned in brewing. Some judicious method may be fallen upon to apply it with propriety to the ex∣hausted malt, so as to make it again fit for the pur∣pose of brewing; for the quality of the Saccharine part of malt resembles that of common sugar, to which it is practicable to reduce it; and its characteristical properties are entirely owing to its intimate connec∣tion with the other parts of the malt, from which such distinguished flavours of Beers are derived as are not the immediate result of the hop. Were it not for these properties, <HI>sugar, molasses, honey,</HI> or the sweet of any vegitable may be used in place of Malt; but as all those are deficient of the other properties of the malt,
<PB N="15" REF="030189_0007_0FE50382E38DC2C8"/>
they will not answer this purpose unless an eligible succedaneum be found to supply this defect. As we are thus circumstanced, a search on the other side would turn more to the brewers account; we have in malt a superabundance of the grosser principles, from which we may infer, that by a judicious addition of sugar &amp;c. to the sacchrine, which is too deficient, many valuable improvements may result; perhaps a second and third wort, of quality equal or very little inferior to the first may be produced to the advantage of the brewer.</P>
<P>ESSENTIA BINA, this is a compound of sugar, made thus: take 8 lb. sugar, and boil it in an iron vessel, until it comes to a thick syrrupy consistence, perfectly black and extremely bitter, to do this it will require a very strong fire, and long boiling, when you have got it sufficiently boiled, pour your lime water into it, or if you do not choose to use lime water, pour clear water into it while hot; for if it is suffered to cool before the water is poured into it, it will become a useless hard burnt substance: But before you add the water, be sure it is sufficiently burnt. The use of essentia is optional.</P>
<P>COLOUR is also a compound of sugar, boiled till it obtains a middle state between bitter and sweet, it gives to Porter that fine mellow colour, usually so much admired in good porter; lime water or clear water must be poured into it, in the same way as directed for the <HI>essentia</HI>; the essentia and co∣lour are added to the first wort and boiled together with it. We would recommend the use of colour to every person; it assists the Porter in refining; upon sugar variously prepared, Porter may be said to depend for strength, spirit, and beauty.</P>
<P>LIME, this may be used or not at pleasure; the in∣tention of it is to assist the liquor to fine, it may also cause it keep better; the method of using it is thus: Take unslacked lime and mix it well with a quan∣tity of water, then let it stand some hours, to settle, after which pour off the water which wil be clear a
<PB N="16" REF="030189_0008_0FE503815BC636D8"/>
glass, add this water to the essentia or colour in the making.</P>
<P>CAPSICUM or Guinea-pepper is more generally known by the name of Cayan pepper, or red pepper, is boiled along with the wort; it disperses wind and crudities caused by indigestion; it gives a warm glow to the stomach which is perceptible on drinking some Beers, if used in small quantities will produce no bad effects.</P>
<P>GINGER has similar effects to capsicum; it cleanses and flavours beer, and is often used to bring forward the working; but capsicum being cheaper is more used, and by its tasteless though extremely hot quality cannot be so readily discerned in Beer as ginger; the ginger is generally added when the yeast is put in, or after the the Beer is worked; in the first case it aids the working, and in the last the fining</P>
<P>COCCULUS INDICUS commonly called Cocculus In∣dia-berries, is very poisonous and stupefactive, and by its great strength attacks the head; it is ground into a fine powder, and too often mixed with malt liquors to make them intoxicating; but this is expressly for∣bidden in Britain by act of parliament, and we would recommend no person to use it. It is the fruit of the <HI>Menispermum Cocculus,</HI> and can only be used to the pre∣judice of the public.</P>
<P>SALT of TARTAR, our author gives us no account of this article, although it is very serviceable to malt liquors. It is of an opening nature, and extracts the virtues of the malt very expeditiously and effectually, giving to the liquor a fine brown colour; it also makes the hops emit their virtue to the malt, softens the water, and throws down the foul particles of the Beer.</P>
<P>HEADING is a mixture of half allum and half cop∣peras, ground to powder; it gives to Porter that beau∣tiful head or froth which constitutes one of the peculiar properties of Porter, and which landlords are so anxious to raise to gratify their customers. Allum is a great drier, and causes that thirst which some Beers occasion,
<PB N="17" REF="030189_0008_0FE503815BC636D8"/>
so that the more you drink, the more you want. Al∣lum gives likewise a smack of age to Beer, and is pe∣netrating to the palate. The properties of copperas are well known as dangerous and destructive, and there∣fore needs no comment; as heading is not necessary we would not reccomend its use.</P>
<P>CORIANDER SEED is of a vehemently poisonous and stupifying nature; one pound of which is equal to one bushel of malt in strength and intoxicating qualities; it is not therefore to be presumed that those who brew for themselves will use an ingredient which is only intro∣duced into the composition of ale, to satisfy an avori∣cious desire of unjust gain.</P>
<P>SALT is highly useful in all Beers, it fines the liquor and gives it a pleasing relish, in the same manner as it does to meat.</P>
<P>LINSEED, CINNAMON, ALLSPICE and several other small articles may be added or witheld according to taste, custom, or practice; as may also <HI>essentia, cap∣sicum, ginger, lime-water</HI> and <HI>salt of tartar;</HI> they being merely optional and used solely to give a fla∣vour to the liquors; hence it is that so many flavours are distinguishable in Porter, and so very few brew∣ers are found to resemble each other in their pro∣duce. But the <HI>cocculus India berries, coriander seed</HI> and <HI>heading</HI> are pernicious, not to say poisonous in the highest degree; and the use of them affords one of the many proofs of the little regard paid to the health of society by interested persons.</P>
<P>WATER is an article of great moment in brewing, although it has escaped the notice of our author. Upon the various qualities of water much depends, and many of the good and bad properties of Porter are to be ascribed. Soft water is universally allowed to be preferable to hard; transparency is however more easily obtained by the use of the last, but for every other property soft water is to be prefered, especially for the purpose of brewing Porter and such Beers as require a fulness of pallet. If the purity of water is determined by its lightness, distilled water only can claim eminence. Rain water is the purest of any that
<PB N="18" REF="030189_0009_0FE503A2DE1A3CE0"/>
is naturally produced, but by the perpetual exhala∣tions of vegetables and other substances, it is never to be procured free from those qualities which pond and river waters possess in a greater degree, these being often highly impregnated with solutions of vegetable and other substances, frequently produce in the liquor such a tendency to acidity, as is not easily conquered; this is more to be guarded against towards the latter end of summer. Where there is liberty of choice we would recommend the use of that water which from natural purity, equally free from the austerity of imbibed earths, and the rankness of vegetable satu∣ration, has a soft fulness upon the palate, is totally flavourless, inodourous and colourless; whence it is the better prepared for the reception and retention of such qualities as the process of brewing is to com∣municate and preserve. For further remarks upon the nature and effects of water, we refer the reader to <HI>Richardson's hints on the brewing of malt liquors.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus analized the various ingredients of malt liquors, and exposed their good and bad quali∣ties to public view, I shall leave a choice to every in∣dividual to prepare to his own taste, and proceed to explain the process of brewing.</P>

<HEAD>A short account of the operations of Brewing.</HEAD>
<P>As it may be objected that many persons are igno∣rant of the art of brewing, to remedy this defect, some instructions, few in number, but quite sufficient shall here have a place; and if they are followed regular∣ly, every person will by a single trial be convinced of the possibility and propriety of providing for his fa∣mily in future, by a cheaper and more pleasing method than by recurring to a public house for every pint of Beer, which the wants of nature may demand.</P>
<P>Every person intending to brew for himself, must be careful to see his malt measured and ground. By no means trusting it to cornchandlers, who frequently impose both in quantity and quality upon those who are so incautious as not to see their own malt mea∣sured and ground.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030189_0009_0FE503A2DE1A3CE0"/>The tubs and vessels intended for use must be care∣fully inspected and cleansed, perfected free from dirt or taint, as the least defect of that nature may distaste the whole brewing.</P>
<P>The different utensils necessary in the operations of brewing are, a <HI>copper</HI> or boiler the size of which should be proportioned to the quantity brewed. A <HI>mash tub</HI>; this vessel is in form of a large tub or hogshead open at one end, and in the other is bored one or more holes, to draw the liquor off at, these holes have stoppers adapted to them.</P>
<P><HI>Coolers.</HI> In large brewhouses the cooler is a large square vessel about 1 ½ feet deep, but in small brewings the wort may be easily cooled into a tub, or by distri∣buting it in small quanties into any clean vessels that can be spared.</P>
<P>A <HI>Working Vat.</HI> This vessel is in form of a large wide tub, it is so placed that the yeast runs over the lowest edge; in small brewings common washing tubs will answer the purpose. These are the principle utensils necessary to brew with; but in brewing very small quantities our author furnishes us with the fol∣lowing substitutes: Many persons (he says) have not the convenience of a copper, though doubtless, were my plan to become general, most landlords would find it their interest to provide one for the accom∣modation of their lodgers, who would be better ena∣bled to pay their rents, and not have recourse to those evasive tricks which are now so commonly practiced upon small housekeepers by the lower class of lodgers. Every person must have a kettle or a large vessel to boil their cloaths, which may be supposed to contain two or three gallons; here then is a sufficient substitute for a copper; every family must have a pail, which will serve as a mash tub, and a washing tub will prove an excellent vessel for the liquor to work in; here then are utensils ready prepared in every family. It is but boring a small hole at the bottom of the pail for the liquor to run through, and your mash tub is complete; though it would be more adviseable to
<PB N="20" REF="030189_0010_0FE5037FCAB48250"/>
purchase a small tub on purpose, a pail being rather small.</P>
<P>The first object in the process of brewing is to place the malt in the mash tub, this is to be particularly at∣tended to, and a small quantity of clean hay or straw put into the bottom of the tub to prevent the malt from running off with the liquor.</P>
<P>The water after being brought to boil, is left to coll until the height of the steam be over; some direct it to be reduced to the proper degree of heat for mashing, by dashing cold water into it, but we would prefer to have all the water boiled, as in many in∣stances the water is improved by boiling. The fla∣vour of the liqour depends greatly upon the degree of heat in the water when put to the malt; for, from the nature of the constituent principles of malt, it is easy to concieve, that a low degree of heat acting principally upon the saccharium, produces a wort replete with the rich, soft, sweat, fully impregnated with it attendant mucilage; we would therefore re∣commend a less degree of heat for those worts that are intended for Ale, than we would for Porter and strong Beer; but the utmost caution is here requisite, as too low a heat produces in the liquor an insipidity of flavour, a tendency to immediate acidity, and a want of early transparency, from the superabundance of mucilaginous matter, which after the utmost ef∣forts of frmentation will leave the Beer turbid.</P>
<P>The contrary application of too much heat, is very apt to unite the whole malt into a pasty mass, which closes instead of opening its pores, this is called <HI>setting of the malt,</HI> from which state it is only to be recovered by adding cold water to it. Too much heat by ex∣tracting an over porportion of oleaginous and earthy particles, renders the business of fermentation difficult and precarious, and impresses an austerity on the fla∣vour of the liquor, which is not easily effaced, in ge∣neral liquors masked, or mashed with too hot water, falls short in softness, fullness, sweetness and quantity.</P>
<P>Most brewers use Fahrenheit's thermometer, at 212 degrees of which water boils; with this, the first mash
<PB N="21" REF="030189_0010_0FE5037FCAB48250"/>
is usually taken at 180 degrees, and the second at 190 degrees, but as few persons will have an opportunity, or afford expence to purchase a brewing thermome∣ter, they may in general leave the water just hot enough to bite smartly upon the finger: A few trials will enable any person to be exact upon this head, always remembering to draw off the second mash some∣what hotter than the first. The water being thus brought to a proper degree of heat, lade is out of your copper over the malt, till it becomes thoroughly wet, then mash it well with a wooden paddle or oar to prevent it from clotting, after standing thus a quar∣ter of an hour a second quantity of water is added, and the whole well stirred as before. Lastly, the full quantity of water is added; and that in proportion as the liquor is intended to be strong or weak.—This part of the operation is called <HI>masking.</HI> The whole is now to be covered up, to compress the stream, and prevent the heat from evaporating; in small quanti∣ties this should be carefully regarded, in larger ones it does not signify so much.</P>
<P>Let your worts stand after mashing about two hours and a half, more or less, according to the strength of the wort or the difference of weather.—Then let the liquor run off into a vessel prepared to receive it; if at first it runs thick and discoloured, draw off one or two pails full, and pour it back into the mash-tub to refine again till it runs clear. In summer it will be necessary to put a few hops into the vessel which is to receive the liquor out of the mash-tub to prevent its turning sour, which the heat of the weather will endanger.—Repeat the mashing for a second wort in the the same manner as the first, never allowing the malt to stand dry, until the quantity of wort you wish to get it extracted, always allowing for waste in boiling. Although our author directs the water for the second mash to be hotter than the water of the first, yet others differ so far as to direct the water to be used cooler, and not to stand on the malt above half the time of the first mashing; the editor is of opinion that this last mode is to be prefered to the first in the
<PB N="22" REF="030189_0011_0FE5036AB0A37638"/>
brewing of Ale and Beer, but for Porter he would choose to follow our author, as the quantity of sugar and molasses in the porter receipts will correct the superabundance of the grosser principle which hot water is calculated to extract from the malt.—Where exhausted malt with some sugar mixed with it is to be used in place of fresh malt, he would also follow his directions.</P>
<P>The next consideration is boiling of the wort. The great use of boiling the wort is to prevent a rawness in the liquor, extract the essence of the hops. separate the grosser parts of the malt, and render the liquor trans∣parent; the weaker the wort is it requires to be boil∣ed the longer.—Where the worts of the different mashes are intended to make one kind of liquor, they are to be mixed together before they are boiled, but where they are intended for different strenghts, they must be boiled separately, the first to be boiled one hour, the second one hour and a half, and if a third, it must be boiled two hours.</P>
<P>The hops and all the other ingredients are now to be added and boiled along with the wort, except the <HI>ginger</HI> and <HI>cocculus berries</HI>; if the copper is not large, and the wort to be boiled at several times, or where the first wort is for ale, and the second for Beer, the hops must be carfully strained from the first boiling in order to be again boiled in the second. In summer the quantity of hops must be encreased, as mentioned in the description of the hop in page 13—as the fine essential oil of the hops is most volatile and soonest ex∣tracted: hence we are taught to boil the first wort no longer than is sufficient to form the extract, for by exposing them too long to the action of the fire, the finer and most valuable parts are dissipated; but to the second boiling or wort we can continue the boiling so long as the flavour of the liquor is not in∣jured by the too grosser parts of the hop, but in this particular we would not advise to go beyond our au∣thor's directions.</P>
<P>Some brewers make use of the first mashing for
<PB N="23" REF="030189_0011_0FE5036AB0A37638"/>
strong Beer, the second for a middling Beer, and the third for small Beer; for the double Ale and Beer they use the liquors resulting from the two first mash∣ings, as a liquor for a third mashing of fresh malt.</P>
<P>After the liquors are all boiled and the hops strain∣ed from them they must be put to cool to a proper temperature for fermentation.—In order that the wort may cool as soon as possible, lay it very thin, that the heat may dissipate soon, for if the liquor does not cool within twelve hours it receives injury by beginning to ferment of itself; in winter this is easily attained, but when the weather is warm, it is more difficult; the cool of night must be taken, and the process perform∣ed in the cellar; In general the liquor should be just luke warm when put to ferment; to those who use a thermometer our author's rule is to put Beer together between 60 and 70 degrees in winter, and ale at 50. In summer, you cannot make it too cold. Those who are not in possession of a thermometer may discover the proper heat by the use of the finger which is ge∣nerally about 90 degrees of heat; they must therefore feel the liquor a little cool before they put the yeast to it.</P>
<P>When you have thus reduced the liquor to a proper degree of coolness, put it into the working tub and add the yeast <HI>(Barm)</HI> to it, in quantity as mentioned in page 13: If you want it to work quick you may add a greater quantity, our author mentions from one to two gallons of yeast to eight bushels of malt, we would not however, recommend any person to exceed this quantity. The yeast must be perfectly sweet and fresh, or it will communicate to the liquor its nauseous and filthy flavour in such a manner as never to be got off; when the yeast is hard and dry, take a little of the liquor made rather hotter than the rest, and put it to the yeast, keeping it in a warm place, till it begins to work, it is then to be put to the whole.</P>
<P>After the yeast is added, let it work till it come to a good deep head, which will be of a yellowish colour; when it begins to fall a little in the middle, it must be skimmed off. Our author allows Ale two or
<PB N="24" REF="030189_0012_0FE5036F81DF6A78"/>
three days to work. Porter to be brought quicker forward, and Beer quickest of all; he directs the Ale to be beat up well once or twice a day during the ope∣ration; but this is a practice which persons brewing for themselves ought to avoid, as it produces bad effects upon the stomach.</P>
<P>The yeast being all skimmed of the head, and the <HI>ginger</HI> and <HI>cocculus berries</HI> added, your liquor is fit for barrelling, which must be done carefully, avoiding the thick sediment at the bottom of the tub; fill your barrels full, and let the yeast work out, adding fresh liquor to fill them till they are quite full and have done working; then bung your barrels, but keep a watchful eye upon them for some time, lest the Beer should suddenly ferment again, and burst them, which is no uncommon accident where due care is not taken; heat of summer, or sudden change of weather will occasion the same misfortune, if your barrels are not watched, and eased when they require it by drawing the peg. The only part which now remains to com∣plete your brewing is fining your beer. In consequence of the subtleness of the essentia, which keeps continually swimming in the Beer; Porter requires a considerable body of findings, but should any of my readers chuse to brew without essentia with amber malt, and with colour only, their Porter will refine of itself very soon. Some however, will perhaps follow the exact receipt, and therefore I mention that finings are composed of Isin∣glass dissolved in stale Beer, till the whole comes to a thin gluey consistence like size, and which must be used discretionally; one pint is the usual proportion to a barrel, but sometimes two and even three are found necessary. Particular care must be taken that the stale Beer in which the Isinglass is disolved be perfectly clear and thoroughly stale.</P>
<P>By attending to these directions, any person may brew as good, if not better Porter than can be supplied from the publicans. Many notions have been artfully raised in the public mind, that Porter requires to be brewed in large quantities, and to be long stored to
<PB N="25" REF="030189_0012_0FE5036F81DF6A78"/>
render it sound and strong; but let any impartial per∣son give these receipts and rules a fair trial, and expe∣rience the surest of all guides and the best of all instruc∣tions will prove the falshood of those prejudiced concep∣tions, which have had their origin with the ignorant, and have been cherished by the interested, One brew∣ing prepared the time the other is using will afford am∣ple time for Porter to refine for use, and every person can best judge of the extent of his consumption. Porter is not the better for being brewed in large quantities, except that the same trouble which brews a peck will brew a bushel, and I know by experience, that a peck of malt brewed over, a fire, in a kettle or a saucepan, under the guidance of these rules, will produce Porter as good and as wholesome as that which is usually paid for at the public-house; and if but one industrious fa∣mily in ten throughout this great metropolis, (London) and in the many large town where Porter is now brewed, is induced to try the experiment, I have no doubt of their continuing themselves, and recommending to others, a practice which will be found simple and easy in its operations, essentially useful in point of health and convenience, and extremely moderate in point of trou∣ble and expence.</P>

<HEAD>Useful Observations.</HEAD>
<P>IN the London edition of this work, our author has thrown together a few Miscellaneous remarks in the form of an appendix.—to these remarks the Editor has made considerable additions, and arranged the whole here under the title of <HI>useful observations.</HI></P>
<P>PORTER is generally brewed from a mixture of pale, amber, and brown malt, although some make use of the brown malt only, and others, of three fourths brown and one fourth pale; but our author seems to prefer the amber malt alone. Porter is ge∣nerally brought forward more quickly in the working than any other malt liquor, small Beer alone excepted, and in a week or ten day the liquor will be drinkable.</P>
<P>ALE is always brewed from pale malt, it differs from Porter and Beer in having a less quantity of
<PB N="26" REF="030189_0013_0FE5039DD0570778"/>
hops, and a greater proportion of malt; the method of boiling and mashing it is the same as with Beer and Porter, but it should be allowed to stand to work two or three days; the <HI>capsicum</HI> and <HI>coriander seeds</HI> are boiled in the wort; when it is sufficiently wrought, it is cleansed by adding a handful of salt, and a little flour mixed up with the <HI>cocculus berries,</HI> then it is fit for barrelling. If properly managed, Ale will keep two or three years, and improve by age.</P>
<P>BEER works remarkably quick, and must be care∣fully attended to in the barrels.—The quantity of <HI>capsicum</HI> in one barrel of Beer, is as much as is com∣monly contained in two barrels of Porter; this ac∣counts for the preference given to it in cold winter mornings as a warmer to the stomach. Small Beer requires no storing, being generally brewed one week and consumed the next.</P>
<P><HI>Brewing in summer.</HI> In warm climates it has been found impracticable to brew malt liquors in summer; the great degree of heat carries the process of fer∣mentation so rapidly on, that the putrefactive fer∣mentation absorbs the vinus. It is even difficult in warm countries to preserve malt liquors from souring, and other destructive qualities, as appears from the following remarks of our author: If they apply to the climate of England, they will produce greater effects in our climate which is warmer.</P>
<P><HI>Effects of bad Cellaring.</HI> If you have but an indiffe∣rent cellar, you should brew only for present use, in which case six weeks will be a very proper space be∣twixt brewing and brewing.</P>
<P>For where beer is kept too long in a bad cellar, so as to be affected by the weather, it will stink though ever so well bunged. For heat opens the pores of the wood, and allows the spirit to evaporate, and after the evaporation, the Beer being affected exactly in the same manner as meat is by the sun, will stink. Hops will not prevent this accident happening to Beer, they only prevent its turning sour.</P>
<P>A number of persons not possessed of this necessary knowledge, and not reflecting upon the influence of
<PB N="27" REF="030189_0013_0FE5039DD0570778"/>
the air; as soon as summer approaches, begin to think directly of brewing Ale, which seldom or never is so good as Beer brewed in a proper season. For instance, the extreme variations of heat in this country, (Eng∣land) are from 16 to 88 degrees. Now in a brewing at 16 degrees, great care must be taken that it does not get too cold; whereas in a brewing at 88, you will hard∣ly be able to get it cold enough, and must take the cool of the night to reduce it down to the medium heat, which should be about 60. This observation is too striking, not to enforce upon every one's mind, the necessity of carefulness and attention in this re∣spect; for as the pressure of the air confines the mer∣cury down to the 16th degree, so does it also confine the spirit of the Beer; and Beer standing in an open tub under that temperature of the air, would keep better than Beer ever so well casked and bunged, when affected by the extreme heat of summer.</P>
<P><HI>The effect on wort when working,</HI> is exactly the same, in cold weather the spirit of the Beer is confined, and it is thereby rendered more kind and free to work itself clear. Whereas in hot weather, the spirit quick∣ly evaporates, thereby leaving the must vapid and flat, unable to work itself clear, but keeping continually on the fret, till totally spoiled.</P>
<P>This is the obvious reason for <HI>the use of sugar prepared for colour,</HI> because sugar will bear the heat better than malt, and when thoroughly prepared possesses such a strong principle of heat in itself, as to bid defiance to the hottest temperament of air, and to render its turning sour impossible, as an instance of its quality:</P>
<P>I have known two casks of the same brewing sent in; one prepared with colour, and charged 30s. (6 dol. 67 ct.) the other without, charged 14s. (3 dol. 11 ct.) upon tasting of both, the cask prepared with colour was very much commended, and the other returned as not drinkable.</P>
<P><HI>Clean casks</HI> are another essential object in brewing good Beer; to keep your casks sweet and in order, never allow them to remain open, but whenever you have drawn of the Beer, bung them up up tight with
<PB N="28" REF="030189_0014_0FE503917AC42C98"/>
the lees within them, and in a good cellar they will never spoil. Should by accident your casks get musty, or not sweet, the following method will remedy the evil. Soak them well for two or three days in cold water, then fill them full of boiling hot water, put in a lump or two of lime, shake it thoroughly, till quite dissolved, let them stand about half an hour, then wash them out with cold water and they will be clean and sweet.</P>
<P><HI>Sour Beer</HI> may be restored divers ways, as by three or four handfuls of beech-ashes thrown into the cask and stirred; or where the liquor is not very sour, by a little put into a bag without stirring; chalk calcined, oyster-shells, egg-shells burnt, sea-shells, crab-eyes, &amp;c. do the same, as they imbibe the acidity, and unite with it into a sweetness.</P>
<P><HI>Beer tasting of the cask</HI> may be freed from it by putting a handful of wheat in a bag and hanging it in the ves∣sel.</P>
<P><HI>New Beer</HI> is made to appear older by adding a little oil of vitrol; but it does not produce any good effects.</P>
<P><HI>To fine Beer quickly,</HI> boil some hartshorn shavings in it.</P>
<P><HI>To soften Beer</HI> that has grown stale, mix with it after you have drawn it to drink, a little salt of wormwood, or a little oyster shell powder.</P>
<P><HI>Ale, Beer, &amp;c.</HI> may be made that will carry to the West-Indies, by mashing it twice with fresh malt, boil∣ing twice, and when it is to be shipped put into the barrel two whole new laid eggs to every five gallons of liquor, to remain. It is said that in ten or fourteen days the shells will be dissolved, and afterwards that the white disappears, but that the yolk remains all the time.</P>

<HEAD>The Method of making Malt.</HEAD>
<P>That nothing may be wanting to render this treatise on brewing complete, the Editor has added the fol∣lowing account of the process of Malting, which he has abridged from <HI>Sir. Robert Murray's method of malt∣ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030189_0014_0FE503917AC42C98"/>Take good barley newly threshed, &amp;c. put about 40 bushels in a stone cistern full of water, where let it steep till the water be of a bright reddish colour; which will be in two or three days, more or less, ac∣cording to the moisture or dryness, smallness or big∣ness of the grain, the season of the year, or the tempe∣rature of the weather.—In summer it is almost impos∣sible to make malt well: In winter it requires longer steeping than in spring or autumn.—It may be known when it is steeped enough by other marks besides the colour of the water; as by the excessive swelling of the grain if over-steeped, and by too much softness; being, when it is in a right temper, like the barley prepared to make soup of. When it is sufficiently steeped, take it out of the cistern and lay in heaps to let the water drain from it; then, after two or three hours turn it over with a scoop, and lay it in a new heap 20 or 24 inches deep.—This is called the <HI>coming heap,</HI> in the right management of which lies the princi∣ple skill. In this heap it may lie forty hours, more or less, according to the forementioned qualities of the grain, &amp;c. before it come to the right temper of malt. While it lies in this heap it must be carefully looked to after the first fifteen or sixteen hours; for about that time the grains begin to put forth roots; which when they have equally and fully done, the malt must, within an hour after be turned over with a scoop; otherwise the grains will begin to put forth the blade and spire also, which must by all means be prevented. If all the malt do not come equally, but that which lies in the middle, being warmest, come the soonest, the whole must be turned, so that what was in the middle may be outmost; and thus it is managed till it be all alike. As soon as the malt is sufficiently come, turn it over, and spread it to a depth not ex∣ceeding five or six inches; and by the time it is all spread out begin and turn it over again three or four times. Afterwards turn it over in like manner once in four or five hours, making the heap deeper by degrees, and continue to do so for the space of forty-eight hours at least. This frequent turning it over, cools,

dries and deadens the grains, whereby it becomes mel∣low, melts easily in brewing and separates entirely from the husk. Then throw up the malt into a heap as high as you can; where let it lie till it grows as hot as your hand can endure it, which usually happens in about the space of thirty hours. This perfects the sweetness and mellowness of the malt. After it is sufficiently heated, throw it abroad to cool, and turn it over again in about six or eight hours after, then lay it upon the kiln with a hair-cloth or wire spread under it; where, after one fire which must last twenty-four hours, give it another more slow, and afterwards a third if it should need it, or according as you want it dried, to pale, amber, or brown malt, it is then ready for the grinding.</P>
<P>The preceding is a short sketch of every operation in the common method of malting; but from the complexity of the process, and the great nicety re∣quired in the management of the whole, it is not pro∣bable that any private family will choose to malt for themselves. If however, there may be any inclined to make his own malt, for further information we refer him to <HI>Combrune's essay on Brewing.</HI></P>
