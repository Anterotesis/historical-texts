<Q><P><HI>Only be thou Strong, and very Couragious,</HI>—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words were spoken by God to <HI>Joshua.</HI> Joshua was a famous Captain. One whom the Lord Himself chose to be the Leader of His People. He was an Emi∣nent Type of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Captain of our Salvation. He was so in respect of his Name. <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>Jesus</HI> are one &amp; the same Name: Only the latter is the Greek, and the former the Hebrew word, noting the same Per∣son, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 8. After the Jews were in Babylon, they according to the manner of the Chaldees called <HI>Joshua, Joshua,</HI> Ezra 2. 2. Thence is <HI>Jesus,</HI> which Name signifieth a <HI>Saviour▪ Joshua</HI> was a Temporal, Christ is an Eternal Saviour. The Children of Israel were not brought into the Promised Land by <HI>Moses,</HI> but by <HI>Joshua;</HI> this signifying that Heaven is not to be obtained by the Works of the Law, but by Faith in Jesus
<PB N="2" REF="001474_0005_0FB351AB4503FB38"/>
Christ. One of those Books which contain the Oracles of God is distinguished by the Name of <HI>Joshua.</HI> Probably the greatest part of it was Written by him: If so he followed the Example of his Predecessor, and Master <HI>Moses.</HI> In it there are recorded the most Memorable passages of Providence towards the Children of Israel for the space of about Seventeen years from the Death of Moses.</P>
<P>In this Chapter we have both the <HI>Commission,</HI> and the <HI>Instructions</HI> which God gave to <HI>Joshua:</HI> He was Commissioned to undertake a great Ser∣vice for God and for his People, unto which the Lord Encouraged him with a Promise of Success, by means of that divine Protection &amp; Assistance which should be vouchsafed to him. But then he was to observe his <HI>Instructions.</HI> The first of which is in the Words now before us. The O∣riginal Words are very Emphatical. <HI>Be thou Strong.</HI> Heb. <HI>Chazak,</HI> denotes a great fortitude of Mind: such a degree of strength as will be Victorious. There is a further Expression of the same importance, <HI>Be very Couragious.</HI> The He∣brew words, <HI>Amatz Meod,</HI> which some translate <HI>Corrobora te valde,</HI> denote an exceeding measure of Courage. Joshua was a very Couragious man, nevertheless, the Lord knew that such an Instruction as this was proper for him, and no∣thing but what he needed.</P>
<P>The Doctrinal Truth which may be insisted on from the Words, is,</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001474_0006_0FB351ACE881DB98"/><HI>That the Servants of GOD (some of them especially) stand in need of a great measure of Fortitude and Courage.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine may be opened and confirmed in several Propositions.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Fortitude or Courage is that Vertue whereby a Man is inclined to perform his Duty, and that because it is Duty, notwithstanding difficulties and dangers in his way.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Courage I am to discourse of is a <HI>Vertue.</HI> It is a <HI>Special Supernatural Grace</HI> wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God. In that it is distinguished from that Courage which is only Natural. There are Men who have a Natural undauntedness and greatness of Spirit, who ne∣ver had any thing of the Vertue or Grace of Courage in them; Such as <HI>Alexander, Caesar, Pompey,</HI> and other great <HI>Heroes,</HI> admired by the World. There is a Courage which is no more than <HI>brutal.</HI> A Lion scorns to turn his back on any Creature Living. Prov. 30. 30. <HI>A Lion which is the strongest among beasts, turns not away from any.</HI> Writers say if he is pursued he will never run for it, but will walk slowly and with a majestick pace. Thus also there is a marvellous fortitude in the War Horse: It is Rhetorically set forth in the 39. Chapter of Job. <HI>Hast thou given the horse
<PB N="4" REF="001474_0007_0FB351AE38FF5AB8"/>
strength, hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? Canst thou make him afraid as the grashopper? He goeth on to meet the armed men, he mocks at fear, &amp; is not affrighted, neither turns he back from the Sword, the quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear &amp; the shield. He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the Captains and the shouting.</HI> It is also said of the <HI>Leviathan,</HI> that he is made without fear. Thus men may be of fearless Tempers, and yet not have that fortitude which I am speaking of, since it is a <HI>Supernatural Grace.</HI> Hence some who are naturally of a timorous disposition, yet have excelled in Courage. The Martyr Books tell us of Women and Children who notwithstand∣ing their being naturally of a fearful heart, have been adorned with a Divine and Heroick Cou∣rage. All the threatnings and tortures inflicted on them by cruel persecutors have not been a∣ble in the least to daunt them.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Grace will make those in whom it is, to <HI>surmount difficulties and dangers.</HI> It is a Ver∣tue contrary to despair, and despondency of Spirit. When great difficulties appear, men are apt to think they shall never be able to conquer them, so do they grow faint hearted, and lye down under discouragements. But the Grace of Courage will surmount all difficulties. This we see in the Spies who were sent to search the Land of Canaan. The Cowards among them said, the People are strong that dwell in the Land, we be not able to go up against them,
<PB N="5" REF="001474_0008_0FB351AFD840A228"/>
they are stronger than we. They are men of great stature, they are Giants, the Sons of Anak. Thus did they despond and despair, and would not go forward when they had an express pro∣mise from God that they should conquer if they would have obeyed his Command in the Sea∣son of it. But Couragious <HI>Caleb,</HI> (who was like his Name, <HI>Caleb</HI> signifies <HI>All heart</HI>) said, Let us go up and possess the Land for we are well able to overcome it: fear ye not the People of the Land, they are bread for us; Their defence is departed from them. Here was the Grace of Courage. It is a Grace contrary to all sinful fear as well as despair. It bears up the heart a∣gainst sinful Unbelieving fears: Josh 10. 25. <HI>Fear not nor be dismayed, be strong and of good Courage.</HI> Danger causeth fear: but the Grace of Courage makes a man to be above the fear of danger. Hezekiah manifested this Grace to be in him, when he incouraged his <HI>Captains and Souldiers</HI> notwithstanding the danger they were in from a formidable Enemy beleaguring them, with a numerous Army, 2 Chron. 32. 6, 7. <HI>He set Cap∣tains of War over the People, and spake comfortably to them, saying, be strong and couragious, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the multitude that is with him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A Couragious man is resolute and un∣daunted <HI>in the way of Duty,</HI> and that because it is his duty. The Command of God makes him to act Couragiously, Josh. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 9. <HI>Have not I Com∣manded
<PB N="6" REF="001474_0009_0FB351B134A62640"/>
thee, be strong, and of a good Courage.</HI> That's a <HI>good Courage</HI> when Conscience of the Com∣mand does animate a man unto his duty. Des∣perate Resolutions in an evil design are not the Vertue of Courage, but most opposite thereunto. Absolom had <HI>Russians</HI> for his Servants, who would venture on any wicked attempt though never so hazardous, which their Master would put them upon. He said to them, when I say to you, Smite Amnon, then kill him, <HI>fear not, be Couragious and Valiant,</HI> 2 Sam. 13. 28. To kill one of the Kings Sons was a bold undertaking: They might well think that <HI>David</HI> the King would be avenged on them for it: but their venturing on so dangerous an action was not as Absolom cal∣led it <HI>Courage and Valour,</HI> because what they did was wicked, and altho' according to the Com∣mand of their revengeful Master, most contrary to the holy Commandment of God. There is a <HI>Boldness</HI> which is not the Grace of <HI>Fortitude,</HI> or true Magnanimity, but <HI>Madness</HI> rather. So it is when men fight against God. When they are bold and desparate in the ways of Sin. Eliphaz says of the wicked man, That <HI>he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Al∣mighty, he runneth upon the thick bosses of his buckler,</HI> Job 15. 25, 26. Moreover, The Grace of Cou∣rage does not only incline a man to do his duty, but therefore to do it notwithstanding difficul∣ties in his way, <HI>because it is his duty.</HI> Suppose a man does what his duty obligeth him unto, and
<PB N="7" REF="001474_0010_0FB351B2C81B12C0"/>
runs through great dangers in the performance of it; if he is animated with carnal Motives only, we cannot say that he has the Grace of Courage, nor indeed any Grace at all. When Jehu executed Judgment on the house of Ahab, he did what God Commanded him, but he aimed at getting a Crown for himself, and that spoyl'd all. Ecclesiastical Writers inform us of men that would Murder themselves out of vain glory, hoping that they should on that account be Esteemed and Honoured as Martyrs. This was not their duty, nor was Conscience of duty that which emboldened them so to act. Thus we see what is implied in the Grace of Fortitude and Courage.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>The Servants of GOD stand in need of, and should endeavour after a good Measure of this Grace.</HI></P>
<P>A small measure of it is not enough for them, they need more. The Apostle says to the He∣brews, <HI>You have need of Patience,</HI> Heb. 10. 36. Christians need more than a little Patience that so they may do and suffer the will of God after a becoming manner. Great <HI>Patience</HI> argues great <HI>Courage.</HI> They that have the greatest measure of this Grace need more. For they have it not in a perfect degree. Consider the most Eminent Saint on Earth in that Grace in which he does most excel, yet is he defective therein. The
<PB N="8" REF="001474_0011_0FB351B45A7F1C90"/>
most Couragious Christian is too Subject unto sinful fear and faintings. <HI>Abraham</HI> excelled in Faith, and consequently in Courage. And yet when he was in <HI>Gerar</HI> he wanted Courage. The fear of man brought him into a dangerous snare. <HI>Moses</HI> was a man of Extraordinary Courage, yet he fainted under the burden of the Government which he complained was too heavy for him, and thence begged that God would kill him out of hand rather than prolong his dayes un∣der such a burden, <HI>Numb.</HI> 11. 15. <HI>David</HI> was a man of great Courage and Resolution: One of Sauls Servants gave him that Character, That he was a <HI>Mighty Valiant Man and a Man of War,</HI> 1 Sam. 16. 18 But his Courage failed him when he was in <HI>Gath,</HI> when he did that which was very unbecoming such a Captain and Commander as he had been. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> was a man of great Resolution: Nevertheless, under the sur∣prize of a Temptation he had not the Courage to own himself to be a Disciple of Christ. These Examples show that the most Couragious Ser∣vants of the Lord need more of this Grace. And God would have his People to be very Couragious. We often hear him in his word calling on his Servants to Exercise and to Ma∣nifest this Grace: Psal. 31. 24. <HI>Be of good Cou∣rage and he shall strengthen your hearts, all ye that hope in the Lord.</HI> q. d. don't give way to despon∣dencies of Spirits, pluck up your Spirits, and God will give you fresh supplies. The Lord by
<PB N="9" REF="001474_0012_0FB351B5C37FB4C8"/>
the Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> excites all his People, and all Ranks and Orders of Persons among them unto an holy fortitude. <HI>Be strong O Zerubbab<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, be strong O Joshua the high Priest, be strong all ye Peo∣ple of the Land, saith the Lord,</HI> Hag. 2. 4. To the like purpose does the Apostle Exhort Christians, 1 Cor. 16. 13. <HI>Quit your selves like men: be strong.</HI> Several things may be mentioned for the further confirmation of the Truth before us, shewing that the Servants of God ought not to be dis∣mayed, but to be very Couragious, and that they have reason to be so. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They have many and great Enemies.</HI> There∣fore they have need of a great measure of Cou∣rage that so they may bear up against them. The World is their Enemy. They meet with great Temptations in the way of Obedience from the things of the World, and in truth those which are called the good things of the World, the Profits, Pleasures, Preferments of it are the greatest Temptation. Some who have stood out Couragiously against the Evil things of the World, that Prisons and Cruel Punishments could not move them from their Holy Profession, when they have been Tempted with the Riches, and Honours of the World, they have fallen Lamentably and Shamefully, to their Eternal ruin. There is need of much Grace that so they may be able to Resist and Conquer all Temptations of that nature. But then the Men of the World are Enemies to the
<PB N="10" REF="001474_0013_0FB351B735879D00"/>
Faithful Servants of God. Ungodly men, are and ever have been, and ever will be haters of the Godly. The old Enmity between the Seed of the Serpent, and the Seed of the Woman re∣mains still, and will do so to the end of the World. He that is upright in his way, is an abomination to the wicked. Nor is this to be marvelled at, 1 Joh. 3. 13. <HI>Marvel not my Brethren if the World hate you.</HI> For the Servants of God and of the World are of very differing both Principles and Practices. The Laws by which they are go∣verned are not the same. It was an old com∣plaint against the People of God, <HI>Esther</HI> 3. 8. <HI>Their Laws are diverse from all People.</HI> They do by a contrary Profession and Practice condemn the world, (as <HI>Noah</HI> did) and that exposeth them to the worlds hatred and rage. Christ said to some of his natural Relations, who were carnal and worldly men: Joh. 7. 7. <HI>The World cannot hate you, but me it hates because I testify of it, that the Works thereof are Evil.</HI> So it is with Christi∣ans who are Christians indeed. They must be always swimming against the stream: Alwayes rowing against the wind and tide. Therefore they have need of Strength: They have need of Courage that so they may be able to bear up bravely against all the storms of wrath and rage which the worlds hatred will raise against them. Nor is the world their greatest Enemy. They have more potent Enemies than the greatest men, or than all the men in the world, whom
<PB N="11" REF="001474_0014_0FB351B8C72168B0"/>
they must fight with, and either overcome them or be killed by them: Eph. 6. 12. <HI>We wrestle not against flesh and blood,</HI> h. e. not against weak frail Enemies, not with them only or chiefly: <HI>but a∣gainst Principalities, against Powers, against the Rulers of the darkness of this World, against Spiritual Wickedness in High Places.</HI> Christians must Fight with a Great and Bloody Dragon: They must Fight with a Hungry Roaring Lion. Has not a man that must Encounter Lions, need of Strength and Courage? Such Courage there was in the Martyr <HI>Ignatius:</HI> When he was Con∣demned to be Devoured with Lions, he was so far from being at all appalled or dismayed at it, as that he said, He would provoke the Lions to fall on him; and (said he) <HI>when the Lions Teeth have Ground me, I shall become such Bread as the Lord will be pleased with.</HI> Here was Courage. But 'tis another kind of Lion, that Christians are Endangered by: It is the Infernal Lion who seeks to Devour them; whom they must Resist being stedfast in their Profession of the Faith; and how shall they do that without an Holy Fortitude and Courage? But then there is one Enemy more to be Overcome by them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Death: And that is to Nature, the most For∣midable Enemy. Some of you know that the Philosopher said of it, That it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Of all Terrible the most Terrible.</HI> It is in <HI>Job</HI> called, <HI>The King of Terrors,</HI> Job 18. 14. And this is an Enemy which every man must
<PB N="12" REF="001474_0015_0FB351BB06232AC0"/>
Encounter with. There is no avoiding of it, Eccles. 8. 8. <HI>There is no discharge in that War.</HI> It is a great point of Christian Fortitude and Cou∣rage, to be able to look Death in the Face with∣out any Dread of it: To be so far above the Fear of Death, as to Live in a longing Expectation of it; and through Faith in Christ, to Triumph over that Enemy: To be no more afraid of Death, than a man would be of a Serpent, that has no Sting or Poyson. Thus the Holy A∣postle, 1 Cor. 15. 55. <HI>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God who giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Servants of God have difficult Duties be∣fore them;</HI> and therefore they had need of Cou∣rage, that so they may hold out in the way of Duty. They have a long Journey to go, and the Way which they must go in is Difficult and Dangerous: It is like the Wilderness which the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> passed thorow when they were going to the good Land, it was a terrible Wil∣derness, in which was fiery Serpents and Scor∣pions and Drought. And it may be the Lord to Exercise the Patience and Courage of his Servants, will keep them a long Time in this woful Wilderness; in which they must En∣counter with distressing Difficulties. The Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> were detained Forty Years in the Wilderness of <HI>Arabia;</HI> and what Difficulties did they meet with in that Forty Years Temptati∣on▪
<PB N="13" REF="001474_0016_0FB351BC72B1A940"/>
Sometimes they were ready to give out, resolving to go no further; but to return to <HI>E∣gypt</HI> again: Such Faultring and Fainting is for want of a due measure of Courage. Where∣fore the Scripture says, <HI>Let us not be weary in Well-doing; for in due season we shall Reap, if we Faint not,</HI> Gal. 6. 9. A Weak man will soon be weary, and faint; but a Strong man will hold out. A man that has a great measure of For∣titude and Strength of Soul, will be so far from being deterred from his Duty, as that his Spirit will rise with Opposition and Difficulty in his way; as <HI>David's</HI> did when he was derided for his Zeal: <HI>I will yet be more Vile,</HI> said he, 2 Sam. 6. 22.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Servants of God are many times Exercised with very Great Sufferings in this present evil World.</HI> They must wade thro' a Sea of Troubles, as the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> passed thro' the Red Sea in their way to <HI>Canaan:</HI> Act. 14. 22. <HI>We must thro' much Tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> Then we have need of much Fortitude and Courage, that so our Spirits may not sink under our Bur∣dens; which if we have but a small measure of this Grace we shall be apt to do: Prov. 24. 10. <HI>If thou Faint in the Day of Adversity thy Strength is small.</HI> So if thy Strength is small, thou wilt Faint in the Day of Adversity. Very great Afflictions are oftentimes the Portion of very good Men. <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>Thou hast shewed me great and sore Troubles,</HI> Psal. 71, 20. And in Psal. 119. 107. <HI>I
<PB N="14" REF="001474_0017_0FB351C1A8912D78"/>
am Afflicted very much.</HI> How shall such an one bear up without much Strength and Courage? The Servants of God are subject unto all sorts of Afflictions: They may suffer from the more immediate Hand of God: They may be under Divine Desertion: The Comforter which should relieve their Souls may be far from them. Sa∣tan may be let loose upon them with his fiery Darts. Horrid Injections, Blasphemous Thoughts: Temptations to Atheism and Infidelity. <HI>Terri∣bilia de Deo, Horribilia de Fide;</HI> as an experienc'd Divine speaks. Satan (if God shall see cause to permit him) will shoot Poysoned Arrows, which will fet the Soul on Fire. And which is the saddest Affliction in the world, Iniqui∣ties may prevail against them, the Corruptions of their own Hearts may be let loose upon them, &amp; that will make them weary of their Life. No Af∣fliction in the world is like that to an holy man. One of the Ancients says truly, <HI>Difficilius est Luctari cum Libidine quam cum Cruce:</HI> It is a sadder Affliction than to be Crucified: worse than any Cross. They are also subject unto sufferings from Men: Persecuted they shall be; 2 Tim. 3. 12. <HI>All that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer Persecution.</HI> At least they shall suffer the Persecution of the Tongue: Men will Revile them, and speak all manner of Evil of them. The better a man is, and the more good he does in the world, the more shall he be Reviled, and Evil spoken of by the Enemies of Truth and
<PB N="15" REF="001474_0018_0FB351C31F7A5D68"/>
Holiness. It may be their Liberties, their Live∣lihood, yea, and Life it self will be taken from them on the account of their Religion. Then they need a mighty Courage. <HI>Add to your Faith Vertue,</HI> (that is Courage) saith the Scripture. When Christians suffer Couragiously for their Faith in Christ, then do they add to their Faith Vertue. And thus it has been with the <HI>Martyrs of Jesus.</HI> When they knew they should Dy for it, they have freely and openly Declared their Faith in Christ; in nothing terrified by their Adversaries, or by the tortures inflicted on them. This could not be without a great measure of Christian Fortitude: God had given them not a Spirit of Fear, but of Power.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Servants of God have no sufficient cause to be Dismayed.</HI> Why should they be Dismayed, considering who is with them to Protect, Support and Save them? When the Town where the Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> had his abode was surrounded with an Army of <HI>Syrian</HI> Enemies, his Servant being afraid, the Prophet said to him, <HI>Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with them,</HI> 2 King. 6. 16. How was that? Ver. 17. <HI>Behold the Mountain was full of Horses, and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha.</HI> There was an Army of Angels ready to Defend them against the Army of <HI>Syrians.</HI> Yea, GOD Himself is with his Faithful Servants. This consideration made <HI>David</HI> Couragious; Psal. 118. 6. <HI>The Lord is on my side, I will not Fear. What can man do unto me?</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001474_0019_0FB351C4C268CA70"/>
From this also did <HI>Hezekiah</HI> hearten his Sub∣jects, when their Capital Town was beleagured with a mighty Army; 2 Chron. 32, 7, 8. <HI>Be not Dismayed for the King of</HI> Assyria, <HI>nor for all the Multitude that is with him: For there be more with us than with him. With him is an Arm of Flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our Battels.</HI> One GOD is infinitely more than an Army of more than Two hundred Thousand Men. They that have the <HI>God of Armies</HI> on their side, need not fear any thing. <HI>We will not Fear</HI> (say the Lords People) <HI>the Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our Refuge.</HI> All the Hosts of Creatures in Heaven and Earth, are under his Command: He can make which of them he pleaseth to Fight for his Servants, and against his and their Enemies. When the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> had a miraculous Victory over their Ene∣mies, it is said, Judg. 5. 29. <HI>They Fought from Heaven; the Stars in their Courses Fought against Sisera.</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Historian relates, That when that memorable Battel was Fought, there hap∣ned a Prodigious Storm of Rain with Hail; and that the Wind was on the Backs of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> but in the Faces of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> which took away their light, and made their weapons of War unserviceable to them. Thus did the Lord of Hosts make the Stars to Fight in their Courses; their Influences causing the Tempest, which prov'd Fatal to his Enemies. The <HI>Spanish Ar∣mada,</HI> which threatned <HI>England</HI> with an Invasion,

was in part disappointed by the Stars Fighting against them in their Courses, in respect of Winds and Storms which proved destructive unto them, when the Spanish General in a blasphemous rage, said, That on that day God Almighty was a <HI>Lu∣theran,</HI> and made the four Elements to be <HI>Luthe∣rans.</HI> They that have God to be with them, have no cause to be dismayed, since they are from thence assured not only of safety but of Success. It was promised to <HI>Joshua,</HI> That <HI>the Lord would be with him,</HI> and that he should make his way prosperous, and have <HI>good Success.</HI> To be Couragious is the way to obtain the gracious presence of God. It was said to the Judges in Israel, <HI>Deal Couragiously, and the Lord shall be with the Good.</HI> When good men deal Couragiously the Lord will be with them. The Angel said to <HI>Gideon, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour,</HI> Josh. 6. 12. When his Servants shew themselves mighty men of valour, the Lord is with them.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>There are some Servants of God who above others stand in need of Christian Fortitude and Courage.</HI></P>
<P>All Christians stand in need of this Grace on the account of that Spiritual Warfare which they are called unto, but some in a more especial manner as being called unto greater Services and greater Sufferings than others are.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="001474_0021_0FB351C7B8967B10"/>More Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Faithful Rulers</HI> need much of this Grace. When Solomon was entring on his Government, his Father David said to him, <HI>Be they strong, and shew thy self a man:</HI> 1 King. 2. 2. q. d. Now thou art to be the Ruler of a great People, thou wilt meet with strong Temptations, and hast need of a Manly Courage and Fortitude to Con∣quer them. Rulers are in a Difficult and La∣bourious Station. A famous Divine among the Reformers, was wont to say, That there are three Labours grievous to be endured: <HI>Regentis, Docen∣tis, et Parturienti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> If a Ruler will do well, he must expect to hear ill: It will be impossible to please the Multitude in every thing. And if things do not go as they would have them, it is natural for them to blame their Rulers, be they never so Faithful and Laborious in the Station God has set them in. Was there ever a better Ruler than <HI>Moses?</HI> And yet how often did the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> Murmur against him; and lay the blame of all their Miseries at his Door? Which forc'd him to Cry to God against them: Exod. 17. 4. <HI>Moses Cried to the Lord, saying, What shall I do to this People? They be almost ready to Stone me. Moses</HI> was Heir apparent to the Crown of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but he refused that to serve his own Peo∣ple; which he did with great Fidelity, and they were ready to requite him with Stones; as the <HI>Jews</HI> did Christ for the Good Works He did a∣mong them. We have a most amazing instance
<PB N="19" REF="001474_0022_0FB351C94DDDD9B8"/>
of this Murmuring Spirit against their Faithful Rulers, in Numb. 16.41. <HI>All the Congregation Mur∣mured against</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron, <HI>saying, You have Killed the People of the Lord.</HI> But the day before they spoke this, they had seen Miraculous Judg∣ments of God Executed on Murmurers. Some of them were destroyed by Earthquakes; and went down alive into Hell,&amp; others of them were consumed by Fire from Heaven: The very next day they fall to Murmuring again; and call those wicked Rebels whom God had made Examples of his Vengeance, <HI>The Lords People;</HI> and Charge their Rulers with being the Authors of their Death. Was not <HI>Samuel</HI> a good Governour? He never took a Bribe in his Life, of any man. An Ungrateful People could not but acknow∣ledge that he had been a good Governour: No man could accuse him of any Male-Administra∣tion: For all that they Rejected him, and Longed for another, until God sent them a Tyrannical one, whom He gave in his Anger and took a∣way in his Wrath. Was not <HI>David</HI> a good Com∣mander? And yet when a Fatal Accident hap∣ned at <HI>Ziklag,</HI> the People began to speak of Stoning him. Rulers, especially such as are Chief in Government, are sometimes called unto a work in which they will meet with great Op∣position: So it is when they are set over a De∣generate People; whose <HI>Reformation</HI> their Office obligeth them to Endeavour. Then they need a great Courage. Thus when <HI>Asa</HI> was King,
<PB N="20" REF="001474_0023_0FB351CC8E2A4FF0"/>
the People were greatly Corrupted with Idola∣try; and some of the greatest Persons in the Kingdom were <HI>Enemies to Reformation;</HI> in special the Queens Mother was so. Wherefore God sent a Prophet, who said to the King and Peo∣ple; <HI>Be you Strong, and let not your Hearts be Weak; for your work shall be Rewarded.</HI> What work? Their Endeavours to Reform Corruptions and Abuses, both as to Worship and Manners: when <HI>Asa</HI> heard this, 'tis said, <HI>He took Courage,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 7, 8. Moreover, It is the Duty of Magistrates to cause Evil Doers to be Punished, according to their Demerits: which they cannot do with∣out Exposing themselves to the Hatred and Ob∣loquy of it may be not a few; and that will terrify them from the Discharge of their Duty in Punishing Offenders, if they have not Cou∣rage. <HI>Job</HI> was a Faithful and Couragious Ma∣gistrate: wherefore he speaks as in Job 31. 34. <HI>Did I fear a great Multitude, or did the Contempt of Families terrify me?</HI> He knew that a Multitude of evil men would be Enraged at him; especially that the Families which were Related to the Malefactors, whom he ordered to be Punished for their wickedness, would be displeased; but that could not terrify him from the discharge of his Duty. There are Judges who if <HI>Great Cri∣minals</HI> are <HI>Great Men,</HI> they will say nothing; but keep themselves at Home, when they should be on the Seats of Judicature. <HI>Job</HI> was no such Timerous▪Man-pleasing Judge; therefore
<PB N="21" REF="001474_0024_0FB351CE7A3D2A18"/>
he adds, that he was not so terrified as to <HI>keep Silence, and not go out of Doors.</HI> Judges must be <HI>Able Men,</HI> Exod. 18. 21. The Hebrew phrase there, is, <HI>Aushe Chaijl, Men of Might;</HI> not in re∣spect of Strength of Body, but of Greatness of Soul. A man of a Little Soul will be easily Cor∣rupted with a Bribe; or out of Fear be Partial in his Judgments: But he that has a Mighty Couragious Soul, will not be so. A Famous Judge said, that the Life of a Judge was, <HI>Militia qu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dam si non Martyrium;</HI> in both which Courage is requisite: He will meet with many Temptati∣ons to Partiality by the importunity of Friends; which will assuredly Overcome him, if he has not the Vertue of <HI>Courage:</HI> And a <HI>Martyr</HI> he must be in bearing Patiently the Provocations, Censures, Reproaches which the displeased Party (and one Party will be displeased) shall cast upon him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Ministers of Christ,</HI> need a good measure of Courage. They must deliver the Messages of God with freedom and boldness. The A∣postles prayed that they might do so. Act. 4. 29. <HI>Grant unto thy Servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word.</HI> And Paul desired the Christi∣an Ephesians to pray for him that he might <HI>Speak boldly as he ought to speak,</HI> Eph. 6. 20. It be∣longs to them as well as unto Civil Rulers to Endeavour to <HI>Reform</HI> the World. When there was great Corruptions and Immoralities in the Jewish Church, and a <HI>Reformation</HI> of those abu∣ses
<PB N="22" REF="001474_0025_0FB351CFF5299E80"/>
was discoursed of, it was said to <HI>Ezra</HI> the Minister of God, <HI>this Matter belongs to thee, be of good Courage, and do it,</HI> Ezr. 10. 4. When a Storm of Persecution riseth it falls chiefly upon them. They are (as <HI>Uriah</HI> was) <HI>Set in the Fore-front of the hottest battel.</HI> The Malignity of the old Ser∣pent and of his Seed aims at them especially, because they are Eminently instrumental in pulling down Satans Kingdom,&amp; in advancing the Interest &amp; Kingdom of Christ in the World. One of the Kings in <HI>Persia</HI> caused all the Ministers of Christ throughout his Dominions to be Martyred when their Flocks escaped his fury. He thought that if the Shepherds were all destroyed, their Flocks would soon be scattered and come to no∣thing. They are the Lords Witnesses who are a torment to them that dwell on the Earth. They are by their Office <HI>Reprovers.</HI> And there∣fore must Reprove the Sins of men impartially, without sparing any who are Guilty, be they Great or Small. This Charge did the Lord lay upon his Prophet; Isa. 58. 1. <HI>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet, and shew my People their Transgressions, and the House of Jacob their Sins.</HI> Sometimes they are called to Oppose and Re∣prove the Generality of their People. <HI>Aaron</HI> should have done so; but he wanted Courage: It seems he was afraid the People would then do him a mischief, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. 22. Some of the Jewish Writers say, (how truly I know not, the Scrip∣ture mentions nothing of it) that <HI>Hur</HI> one of the Princes in <HI>Israel</HI> Opposed their Idolatry in
<PB N="23" REF="001474_0026_0FB351D219235D20"/>
the Wilderness; at which they were so enra∣ged, as to Kill him; and that <HI>Aaron</HI> was afraid that the Ungoverned Multitude would serve him after the same manner. To be sure, he was more afraid than he ought to have been; and that Fear was very unbecoming his Character. Sometimes the Ministers of God are called to Reprove Great Men: Jer. 5. 5. <HI>I will get me to the Great men, and will speak to them.</HI> How shall they do this without a great Fortitude of spirit? When King <HI>Uzziah</HI> would presume to go into that part of the Temple, which none but the Priests might enter into; and offer Incense there: It is said, that <HI>Azariah</HI> the Priest went in after him; and with him Four-score Priests of the Lord, <HI>who were Valiant men: And they withstood</HI> Uzziah <HI>the King.</HI> How did they withstand him? Not by offering any Violence to his Person: but by faithful Admonitions and Reproofs. They said to him, <HI>Thou hast Trespassed; neither shall it be for thine Honour, from the Lord God:</HI> Meaning, that God would leave a mark of Infamy upon him, for that his Trespass: And so it came to pass, for he was immediately smitten with an incurable Leprosy. He Died a Leper, which was not for his Honour, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26. 17, 18, 19. A Courage not altogether unlike to this, there was in <HI>Ambrose:</HI> For when the Emperor <HI>Theodo∣sius</HI> had in his Passion caused many innocent men to be Slain, among some who were guilty of a Treasonable Offence; <HI>Ambrose</HI> refused to
<PB N="24" REF="001474_0027_0FB351D4782B9F98"/>
Administer the Sacrament to him, until he had manifested a very deep Penitence and Repen∣tance for his Error. The Ministers of God may well be Couragious in the discharge of their Duty, considering whom they Represent; and whose Name they come in, when they deliver the Messages of God. When <HI>David</HI> was to En∣counter with <HI>Goliah;</HI> that which made him so Couragious, was that he could say, <HI>I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of Hosts,</HI> 1 Sam. 17. 45. As a Message from God ought to be received with great respect, altho' it comes by the hand of an inferiour Person. When <HI>Ehud</HI> said to a Prince, <HI>I have a Message from God unto you;</HI> he arose out of his Seat to hear it. When <HI>Balaam</HI> was sent with a Message from God to <HI>Balak</HI> the King of <HI>Moab;</HI> he said to him, <HI>Rise up and hear,</HI> Numb. 23. 18. So that Consideration is sufficient to in∣spire the Messenger with Courage.</P>
<P>It has been reported, that a Minister Preach∣ing to the Earl of <HI>Stratford,</HI> then Lord Deputy in <HI>Ireland;</HI> he faithfully Reproved some Cor∣ruptions which that Governour was known to be guilty of; at which he was displeased; and the next day in a great Passion sends for the Minister beginning his Discourse thus; <HI>Yesterday, when you were before me,</HI> you said such and such things. The Minister replied to him, You are mistaken, Sir, I was not before you Yesterday: <HI>I confess I am before your Excellency to Day; but you were before me Yesterday.</HI> You Represent the
<PB N="25" REF="001474_0028_0FB351D9A4FF86F0"/>
King: but Yesterday I was made the Repre∣sentative of the Almighty GOD, who is infi∣nitely above the Greatest Kings on Earth. Upon that the Earl was so affected, as to dismiss the Minister, without saying any more to him.</P>
<P>Of all men in the World, the Ministers of CHRIST may not be <HI>Spiritual Cowards.</HI> It was a great and desired Character, which was given of that Super-eminent Minister and great Re∣former in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Knox.</HI> One standing by his Grave said, <HI>Here lies one who in the Cause of God, never knew what it was to be afraid of the Face of a Man.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Military Men</HI> above others need a great Fortitude and Courage. For if they are called to actual Service against the Enemy, they Ex∣pose their Lives to danger, which without Cou∣rage they will be loth to do. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> said con∣cerning his Father <HI>Gideon,</HI> Judg. 9. 17. <HI>My Father fought for you, and adventured his life far.</HI> He Exposed himself to the greatest dangers: for him with but Three hundred to ingage in battel with more than an hundred thousand, was Courage and <HI>Mighty Valour,</HI> as the Angel said of him: but since the word for the battel to begin, was, <HI>The Sword of the Lord,</HI> and of Gideon! <HI>the Sword of the Lord,</HI> and of Gideon! that put Cou∣rage into him. If there had been only <HI>the Sword of Gideon,</HI> he might have despaired, but he knew that <HI>the Sword of the Lord</HI> was ingaged with him, and that made him fear no danger. It is also
<PB N="26" REF="001474_0029_0FB351DB1169E6A8"/>
said of the people of Zebulon and Naphtali, That they <HI>Jeoparded their Lives unto death in the high pla∣ces of the field,</HI> Judg. 5. 18. First they Expected their Enemies to come to them on Mount Tabor, where they put themselves in battel array, so did they Jeopard their Lives in the high places of the field, but they not coming, they went down to meet their Enemies, chusing rather an ho∣nourable Death in the Service of their Coun∣try, than to live Slaves under such a Tyrant as <HI>Jabin</HI> was. They had more Courage and Grace than to be for <HI>Non Resistance and Passive Obedience,</HI> when God called them to make a <HI>Revolution.</HI> Nothing is more unbecoming a Souldier than Cowardice. The old Romans were very severe in their discipline towards such. If a battel were fought and any man saved his Life by flying, they would not suffer him to come home again, they would banish him out of his Country. We find in Scripture that God would not suffer a faint-hearted Souldier to be imployed in the Armies of Israel when they were to go out to battel against their Enemies, left one Coward should make many. Dent 20. 8. <HI>The Officers shall speak unto the People, and they shall say, what man is there that is fearful and faint hearted? Let him go, and return to his house, lest his brethrens heart faint as well as his heart.</HI> It becomes a Souldier to be Valiant. Especially Fortitude and Courage is necessary for Commanders who have Souldiers under them. <HI>Joab</HI> who was the General of Davids Army, al∣tho'
<PB N="27" REF="001474_0030_0FB351DBF253F4F8"/>
we cannot say that he was endowed with the <HI>Grace</HI> of Courage, nevertheless, he was qua∣lified with an Heroick gift in respect of Forti∣tude of Mind. A Learned Historian thinks that Joab was the bravest Captain General that ever drew a Sword. He spoke like an<HI>Hero,</HI> and like a man of Religion too, when seeing the Enemy neady to fall upon him in the Front, and in the Rear, he said to his brother Abishai, <HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the men for our People, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord do what seem∣eth him good,</HI> 2 Sam. 10. 13. This was admirably spoken. Courage in a Commander, puts Cou∣rage in those who are under his Command. It has been said by some, and it is a Truth, <Q>That an Army of Harts who are timorous Creatures, being led by a Lion for their Cap∣tain, will do more Execution, than an Army of Lions would do, having an Hart to be their Leader.</Q></P>
<P>We proceed now to the APPLICATION of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which has been insisted on.</P>
<P>USE. I. This may put us upon <HI>Examination,</HI> whether we have theGrace of Courage? You have heard that men may have a Natural Cou∣rage, and be adorned with an Heroick gift of Fortitude, and yet not have the Christian Grace of Courage, which is most Excellent, and more to be desired than the other. And yet this, they who are naturally Weak and Timorous, may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have a great measure of it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="001474_0031_0FB351DD9DB26EA8"/>Let me then mention to you some Characters of one that has this Grace.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He is one that will bear a Faithful Testimony to the Truth, and against the Errors and Corruptions of the Time and Place in which the Divine Providence has disposed of him.</HI> There are some Truths which are the special Truths of the day. These the Scripture calls, <HI>The present Truth,</HI> 2 Pet. 1. 12. The great Truth of the Time in the Apostles days, was, That <HI>the Promised Messiah is come, and that Jesus of Nazareth is He.</HI> If a man did own that Truth, his Estate, Liberty, and Life was in danger to be taken from him. It argued a no∣ble Courage to be in those that would profess their belief of it. And therefore in those days for a man to speak those few words, <HI>I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,</HI> was as great and a greater evidence of a true Conversion, than any Relation of a work of Grace, is in these days. 1 Joh. 4. 15. <HI>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.</HI> So far as men could Judge it was so. In after ages to assert the God-head of our Saviour was the Truth of the Times. After that to appear for the Truths relating to the Prophetical Office of Christ in opposition to the Traditions of men. And after that truths relating to the Priestly Office of Christ, that He is the alone Priest of the New-Testament, who has made a full Atone∣ment for the Sins of his People by the Sacrifice of Himself, on whose Merit we must depend,
<PB N="29" REF="001474_0032_0FB351DF0798B3C0"/>
and not on any Works or Righteousness of our own; these have been the special Truths of the Times, which many Martyrs have been Sealing with their blood in opposition to Popery. In these Latter Ages truths which respect the King∣ly Office of Christ as he is the only Head of his Church, have been and are the Truth of the Times which we ought Couragiously to bear our Testimony unto.</P>
<P>There are also Errors which are <HI>Errores Secu∣ti,</HI> the Errors of the Age which the Servants of God have been wont faithfully and couragiously to witness against them. The Prophet Com∣plains of such as were not so, Jer. 9. 3. <HI>They are not Valiant for the Truth.</HI> Among the Children of Israel, Idolatry was the great Sin which Peo∣ple were then guilty of: Therefore did the holy Prophets in a Singular manner set them∣selves to Testify against that iniquity. There was a Time when <HI>Arianisme</HI> was the prevailing Error of the Christian World. When an <HI>Arian</HI> was got into the Imperial throne, on a sudden the World was become an <HI>Arian.</HI> Then did <HI>A∣thanasius</HI> acquit himself like a Champion of the Lord, not ceasing to bear his Testimony against the grand Error of that Time; for which he suffered Banishment more than once, and at last Died an Exile. Then was <HI>unus</HI> Athanasius <HI>con∣tra t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tum Mundum.</HI></P>
<P>There is Corruption in Manners as well as in Doctrine, which the Lords Servants should show
<PB N="30" REF="001474_0033_0FB351E0A1751FE0"/>
their Courage in bearing a due Testimony a∣gainst it. Thus it was with the <HI>Jews</HI> after their Return from Captivity in <HI>Babylon;</HI> they did not Apostatize to an Idolatrous Worship; but there were great Immoralities found among them, Sabbath-breaking, Unlawful Marriages, Op∣pression of the Poor, and Scandalous Covetous∣ness; against all which <HI>Ezra</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> were Faithful and Zealous Witnesses. Some of the Lords Servants have lost their Lives, and been Martyred for their Faithfulness in Testifying a∣gainst the Ungodliness of Profane men. <HI>John Baptist</HI> would venture to Reprove <HI>Herod</HI> for his Scandalous Life, though he lost his Head for it. Ecclesiastical Writers inform us, that the <HI>Even∣gelist Timothy,</HI> when he saw the Multitude in the Streets with Clubs, and with Masks on, abomi∣nably Rude and Profane, in an Holy Zeal he Reproved them for their Evil Manners; at which they were so enraged, as that they fell upon him and Murdered him.</P>
<P N="3">2. Another Character of one that has the Grace of Courage, is, <HI>That when he seeth his Call Clear, he'll Venture, let the Event be what it may be.</HI> He'll discharge his Duty, and leave Events with God. Nothing can move him out of the way of Duty. He stands like a Rock: Putting his Trust in God, he is like a Mountain that cannot be re∣moved. Altho' if he persist in what he is called unto, probably it will be prejudicial to his Worldly Interest; he may be a great Loses by it, that
<PB N="31" REF="001474_0034_0FB351E1F56FE6B0"/>
won't move him out of his way, when he is in the way where the Lord calls him to be, and to abide therein. There are men who will be for Christ's Interest so far as will Comport with their own carnal Interest, but no further. Like that Prince of <HI>Navar,</HI> who favoured the Protestant cause, but when <HI>Beza</HI> advised him to venture himself and to fall in with that Religion, being the only true Religion, He replied, He'd venture out in that Sea so far as he might be sure to come safe ashore, but no further: Thus 'tis with many. But where is the Grace of Cou∣rage now! He that has that Grace in Exercise no dangers can affright him out of the way of duty. Did not Pharaoh threaten Moses? but what says the Scripture: Heb. 11. 27. <HI>By faith he forsook Egypt,</HI> that was when he conducted the Children of Israel as their Leader out of Egypt, no more to return thither, <HI>Not fearing the wrath of the King,</HI> who had threatned to be his death: <HI>He Endured:</HI> He persevered in the way of his duty. The Greek word <HI>Ekarterese,</HI> implies For∣titude of Mind, a Couragious undaunted Spirit! <HI>As seeing him who is invisible.</HI> The fear of God makes a Christian to be above the fear of man. When the Empress <HI>Eudoxa</HI> (like Jezabel to the Prophet Elijah) sent a threatning Message to <HI>Chrysostom;</HI> What should be done to him, <HI>Go</HI> (said he) <HI>tell the Empress that I am afraid of nothing, but of Sinning against God.</HI> When there was to be a great <HI>Convention</HI> in the City of <HI>Worms</HI> in Ger∣many,
<PB N="32" REF="001474_0035_0FB351E3CD889D68"/>
and the Emperor sent to <HI>Luther,</HI> that he should appear there, his friends disswaded him, because he had many Enemies in that City: He replied, these disswasions are from Satan: I may do a great Service for Christ by bearing witness to his Truth in that august Assembly, and there∣fore if all the Tyles on the houses in that great City were so many Devils to oppose me, in the the Name of the Lord I will go. This was Couragious and Magnanimous. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. He that has the Grace of Courage <HI>will chuse rather to Suffer than to Sin.</HI> Joseph was Ex∣posed to great Sufferings rather than he would Sin; Gen. 39. 9. <HI>How shall I do this wickedness and Sin against God?</HI> The like holy Resolution we see in Moses: <HI>He chose</HI> (and it was a choice in which his Courage appeared) rather to <HI>Suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of Sin,</HI> Heb. 11. 25. He knew that he could not enjoy those pleasures which the E∣gyptian Courtiers indulged themselves in, but he must then Sin against God. He chose rather to suffer the loss of all the honour and riches of a Kingdom. The Three Worthies in Daniel chose rather to Suffer than to Sin, yea, rather to be burnt alive than to Sin against God: with an undaunted Courage they told the greatest Em∣peror and Tyrant in the World to his face, that he might do his worst, they would never Joyn with him in his Idolatrous Worship, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. 18. The Prophet Daniel when he knew the Em∣peror
<PB N="33" REF="001474_0036_0FB351E4F3DF28D8"/>
had Published an Edict against it, he would let the World see that he worshipped the true God and him only, and would venture to be thrown into the den of Lions rather than be guilty of a Sin of Omission. It is noted con∣cerning the Hebrew Martyrs, That they <HI>were tortured not accepting deliverance,</HI> Heb. 11. 35. <HI>Anti∣ochus</HI> the King of Syria (an eminent Type of <HI>An∣tichrist</HI>) promised those Martyrs that their Lives should be spared if they would eat one Mouth∣ful of Swines flesh, which under the Ceremonial Law, it was not Lawful for them who were Jews to do; Therefore they chose rather to be tor∣tured to Death than to do it. The <HI>Martyrelogies</HI> have many Examples of Christians who have chosen the greatest Sufferings rather than to Sin against their Consciences in the least. To do thus is to be Strong and very Couragious.</P>
<P>USE. II. What shall be thought of <HI>Spiritual Cowards?</HI> That Live so, and Dy so. This we must think of them, that they are not true Christians: For the Grace of Courage is inse∣parable from real Christianity. Christ has said, <HI>Whoever does not bear his Cross cannot be my Disciple,</HI> Luk. 14. 27. And again, <HI>v.</HI> 33. <HI>Whosoever be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that forsakes not all that he has cannot be my Disciple.</HI> This no man will consent unto which has not the Grace of Courage in his Soul. Without Courage the Cross cannot be endured. If a man will be a Christian he must fight Manfully
<PB N="34" REF="001474_0037_0FB351E8EF3D8568"/>
under Christs banner to the last gasp, and not desert his Cause when it comes to a battel. A Christian is a Martyr <HI>in Voto,</HI> willing to part with what he has, Life and all if Christ shall call for it. Act 21. 13. <HI>I am ready not to be bound only, but also to dye for the Name of the Lord Jesus.</HI> And who are Spiritual Cowards?</P>
<P N="1">1. Such as having given their Names to Christ, when Persecution comes they prove Deserters. They have lifted themselves among the Souldi∣ers of Jesus Christ, and by their Baptism Sworn Fidelity to him, yet when Tribulation or Per∣secution ariseth because of the word, by and by they are offended, and turn Apostates from the Truth. Such there were in the Apostles dayes. There were some among the Galatians who urged Christians to be Circumcised as the Jews were, <HI>Only lest they should suffer Persecution,</HI> Gal. 6. 12. In those dayes the Jewish Religion was tolerated in the Provinces of the Roman Empire, when the Christian Religion was not. All the Cir∣cumcised were look'd upon as Jews. Hence some nominal Christians would be so, that they might escape Persecution. In after Ages very many Christians would fall away from the Truth as a new Storm of Persecution arose. And some would hide their Religion: they were convin∣ced in their Consciences that the Gospel was the Truth, and they afraid to disown it lest they should provoke God, and yet afraid to own it left they should be exposed to Persecution and
<PB N="35" REF="001474_0038_0FB351ED0725D580"/>
Death. These men would bribe Corrupt Offi∣cers to sign a <HI>Libel</HI> testifying that they had Sa∣crificed to Idols, altho' they never did so, by that means they escaped the Storm which proved fatal to better Christians. These were called <HI>Libellatici.</HI> The Churches in those dayes cast them out of their Communion as unworthy of the Name of Christians. How many in these latter Times, yea, in our Dayes, have Apostati∣zed from the Truth because of a cruel Persecu∣tion? Are there not Millions of them in one unhappy Kingdom at this day? Has not the French dragon boasted that he has dragooned Twenty hundred thousand Protestants (whom he calls Hereticks) into a Compliance with Po∣pish Idolatry?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Time Servers are Spiritual Cowards.</HI> There have been men in the World whose principle (however their practice) has been to be of that Religion which is uppermost: They will be of the State Religion be it what it will. The Mul∣litude is apt to be of the Kings Religion. When <HI>Jeroboam</HI> set up his Superstitious Worship, the generality of the Nation conformed: They <HI>went willingly after the Commandment,</HI> Hos. 5▪ 11. And when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> who was King over Judah, <HI>for∣sook the Law of the Lord,</HI> it is observed that <HI>all Israel did so with him,</HI> 2 Chron. 12. 1. There was a man whose Name was <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn,</HI> who in the Reign of King Henry VIII. was of his Religion, and in the Reign of King Edward VI. he pro∣fessed
<PB N="36" REF="001474_0039_0FB351EE15943738"/>
himself a Protestant. In the Reign of Queen Mary he turned Papist again. In the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, he would be a Pro∣testant again. Whence if a man was notorious for his Time-serving, it became Proverbial to say, He did <HI>Pernare.</HI> Such an Infamy has his Tem∣porizing left on his Name. Many will be of that Religion which is the way to preferment. They will Sin against their light rather then loose a place of profit or honour. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be for such a trifling honour as a Commission to be a Captain or a Major, or a Justice of Peace, the man will tack about and change his party. Such a Coward (especially if he has been an Hypo∣critical Pretender to Religion) deserves to be an abhorring of all men: What would such a man do, if it should come to Fire and Faggot? And what will such Temporizing Cowards gain by their base Compliances? Most certainly they will find themselves loosers at last, however they may please themselves at present. Christ says, <HI>He that will save his life shall loose it,</HI> Mat. 16. 24. By saving a Temporal Life loose an Eternal Life which is infinitely better. And oftentimes such Time-servers miss of that Temporal happi∣ness which they promised themselves. Our English <HI>Martyrologist</HI> gives a remarkable account of a Man who in Queen Maryes days turned a Pa∣pist: One Expostulating with him about it, and demanding the reason of his deserting the Truth, <HI>I know</HI> (said he) <HI>that the Protestant Religion is the
<PB N="37" REF="001474_0040_0FB351EF74177300"/>
true Religion, but I cannot burn for it.</HI> Within a while this mans house hapned to be on fire, and he himself was burnt to Death in it. He that would not burn for his Testimony to the Truth, must burn in and for his Apostasy from it. It is an awful thought that the <HI>first</HI> of those shall be punished with the Second Death are, <HI>The Fearful:</HI> These are set in the Front, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. 8.</P>
<P>USE. III. I finish my discourse with a word of <HI>EXHORTATION.</HI> And let it be in the words of the Text before us, which are the words of God, <HI>Be you Strong and very Couragious.</HI> I would particularly and especially direct this Exhorta∣tion to <HI>Military</HI> Men: As to the Gentlemen who have occasioned this Solemnity, so to all others who are or may be called to Souldiery and War. I am sensible that I have Exceeded the Time: But forgive me this once. It is this very day five and fourty years since I spoke in this Place on the like occasion; and you may be sure, that I shall never trouble you again on the like occasion after this day. Let me then desire your Patience and Attention unto a few words of Encouragement.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Calling of a Souldier is a Lawful Calling.</HI> Otherwise that which is the Christian vertue of Courage could not be manifested in the Exer∣cise of it. It is said that <HI>the Righteous is bold as a Lion,</HI> Prov. 28. 1. If there is not Righteousness in the Foundation, boldness in the Action, is not
<PB N="38" REF="001474_0041_0FB351F0F417E448"/>
a virtue. This may embolden <HI>Souldiers,</HI> their Calling is a Lawful Calling. They are not like those that live by Robbery, or Pyracy, or by be∣ing Actors in Stage plays, or any other unlaw∣ful Calling. When the Souldiers demanded of John Baptist, saying, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> He did not tell them that they should cease to be Souldiers, which if the Calling had been unlawful he would undoubtedly have done, but he bid themdo Vio∣lence to no man, and be <HI>Content with their Wa∣ges,</HI> Luk 3▪ 14. which implies that they ought to do the work of Souldiers. They might not take Wages for an unlawful Work. Was not one of the first Christian Gentiles a Souldier and a Cap∣tain? <HI>Captain,</HI> or rather Colonel <HI>Cornelius</HI> by Name, Commander of an Italian band, was a∣mong the first Gentiles that were baptised into the Name of Christ, <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 1. with <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. 7. Chronologers suppose, that the Lord Treasurer belonging to the Queen of Ethiopia was bap∣tized two years before Cornelius; but he was in respect of his Religion a <HI>Jew</HI> incorporated into that Church which Cornelius was not, being only a Proselyte of <HI>that Gate,</HI> and not of <HI>Righte∣ousness,</HI> as the Jews distinguish. But to proceed, All Wars are not unlawful. For God Himself is the Author of some Wars, but He is not, nor can he be the Author of that which is absolute∣ly Sinful. Nor would he then be Styled a <HI>Man of War,</HI> as He is, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15. 3. And <HI>the God of Ar∣mies,</HI> Psal▪ 46. 7. The Scripture speaks of, <HI>The
<PB N="39" REF="001474_0042_0FB351F28BB42F70"/>
Wars of the Lord,</HI> Numb. 21. 14. Such as He ap∣proves of and requires. He commanded the Children of Israel to <HI>Contend in battel</HI> with the A∣morites, <HI>Deut.</HI> 2. 24. Battels fought with the E∣nemies of God are called, <HI>The Lords battels,</HI> 1 Sam. 18. 17. There are <HI>Just Wars</HI> which the Lord Himself calls men to engage in. The light of Nature directs men unto a <HI>Defensive War.</HI> God has put a principle of self preservation into his Creatures. And in some cases men may be called to ingage in an <HI>Offensive War.</HI> This may be Lawful when their Liberties, Properties and Possessions are invaded. Thus when the Ammo∣nites made War against Israel, thinking to dis∣possess them of those Lands which they had a right unto, and been in the possession of Three hundred years: <HI>Jephtha</HI> said to the King of the Ammonites, <HI>Thou dost me wrong to War against me,</HI> Judg 11. 27. Therefore the Children of Israel fought against them and slew them with a great Slaughter: This was just. When the Philistines came against Keilah, and <HI>Robbed their Threshing floors,</HI> David and his men did by Gods appoint∣ment fight the Philistines, and delivered Keilah, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 4, 5. The like he did to the Amalekites when they had Plundered and burned Ziklag. Or, if Enemies fall upon those who are in Con∣sideracy, or in Alliance with us, that may be a just ground of War. Of this the Scripture giveth us an Example in Abraham, who when his <HI>Con∣federates</HI> were attacked, headed a small Army,
<PB N="40" REF="001474_0043_0FB351F43414BBB0"/>
and rescued them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 13, 16. Thus also the Children of Israel armed themselves to res∣cue their brethren in <HI>Jabesh Gilead,</HI> when <HI>Nabash</HI> with his Ammonites encamped against them, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. 1. Only it is to be remembred that an <HI>Offensive War</HI> is not to be undertaken but with the Consent and Authority of the Magistrates. The reason is because War is an act of <HI>Vindictive Justice,</HI> and therefore must have the Counte∣nance of those who are by their Office Reven∣gers to Execute wrath on them that do Evil. It is not for private persons to revenge without di∣rection from God or his Vice-Gerents.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is possible for a Man to be a Military Man, and a very Pious Man.</HI> One may be a good Souldier and a good Christian. Altho' gene∣rally it is otherwise. The old verse has been too generally true, <HI>Nulla fides Pietasque viris qui castra sequnntur;</HI> Nevertherless, an Eminency in the <HI>Carnal Warfare,</HI> and in the <HI>Spiritual Warfare,</HI> are not incompatible to the same Person. Some of the most Pious Men we read of in the Scripture were <HI>Souldiers. Abraham</HI> the Father of the Faith∣ful had <HI>Trained Bands,</HI> well disciplined Souldiers under him. <HI>Joshua</HI> the best Man in the World in his Time, was a <HI>Captain General. David</HI> a Man after Gods own heart, was a <HI>Man of War,</HI> as Hushai said of him, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18. 17. and a Souldier from his Youth. In Sauls Time, he was a <HI>Co∣lond,</HI> and after that a King, and a Renowned and
<PB N="41" REF="001474_0044_0FB351F61CEE4000"/>
Successful General. One of the most Eminent Believers spoken of in the New Testament was a Souldier. There was a <HI>Captain,</HI> who said, I have Souldiers under me, If I say to this man go, he goeth, and to another, come, and he cometh. Thus (sayes he) If Christ will but speak the word, my sick Servant will be healed. When Jesus heard this he marvelled, and said, <HI>I have not found so great Faith no not in Israel,</HI> Math. 8. 10.</P>
<P>I might speak of <HI>Military Men</HI> in these Latter days, who have been <HI>Mirrors of Piety.</HI> The most Learned Professor of Theology in the Universi∣ty of <HI>Utrick,</HI> has given the World an account of a Souldier whom he knew, a Young Scotch Gentleman, a <HI>Captain</HI> in the Low Countries of whom he says, that but few Divines were in respect of Devotion, and the <HI>Practice of Piety</HI> equal to him, that was a Souldier: He was a diligent Hearer of the Word not only on the Lords day, but on Week days. He was profitable in Con∣versation: He spent much Time in reading the Scripture, and in Prayer: Would often spend whole days alone with God in his Closet. He kept a constant daily Watch over his heart and thoughts, as well as over his words and actions, until at last being called to ingage in a battel with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he fought Valiantly, and ob∣tained a notable Victory, but he was himself slain in the battel. An Army filled with such <HI>Captains</HI> and Commanders, would surely be
<PB N="42" REF="001474_0045_0FB351F9438D4958"/>
Victorious: God would be with them, and no Enemy would be able to stand before them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is now a Time in which there is occasion to Learn and to Practise the Art of War.</HI> There is a tumultuous noise of the Kingdoms and Nations gathered together. The Lord of Hosts is Muste∣ring the host of the battel. Do we not hear the rushing of the Nations, that make a noise like the noise of the Sea? Peace is taken from the Earth. In what part of the earth is there Peace at this day! The cry from one End of the World to another, is, <HI>Arm! Arm!</HI> Stand to your Arms. And how long shall we hear the sound of the Trumpet, and the alarum of War! who can say how long! It is true that there will a time come when there shall be an Universal Peace all over the World. The King∣doms of the World shall become the Kingdoms of Christ, and then there will be Peace through∣out the Earth. So has the Oracle assured us. Isa. 2. 4. <HI>Nation shall not lift up Sword against Na∣tion, neither shall they Learn War any more.</HI> But that Time is not yet come. We know from the Scripture that there are <HI>Wars of the Lord</HI> yet to come. There is the great battel of <HI>Armageddon,</HI> besides other battels to be fought. Antichrist and his Adherents to their own ruin, will make War against the Lamb and his Followers. It will be in part by the Sword, that Antichristian Persecutors of the Church of God shall be de∣stroyed. That Enemy who has killed so many
<PB N="43" REF="001474_0046_0FB351FBED48D988"/>
with the Sword, <HI>Must be killed with the Sword,</HI>Rev. 13. 10. How many has he killed among the <HI>Waldenses?</HI> Not less than Eleven hundred thou∣sand. How many in <HI>Bohemia?</HI> How many in <HI>Germany?</HI> How many in <HI>France?</HI> How many in the <HI>Netherlands?</HI> How many in <HI>Ireland?</HI> Not to mention other Places: The Lord will give them blood to drink for they are Worthy.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If the Lord shall Call any of you to ingage in a War against his Enemies, in case you act therein from a right principle and for a right End, your work shall be rewarded.</HI> It was said to David, that <HI>the Lord would certainly make him a sure house,</HI> that is Esta∣blish the Kingdom in his Family,<HI>because he fought the battels of the Lord,</HI> 1 Sam. 25. 28. If the Lord will punish men for neglecting to go to War a∣gainst his Enemies when he calls them to it▪ so has He threatned: Jer. 48. 10. <HI>Cursed is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</HI> Warring a∣gainst the Moabites, is called the Work of the Lord. And <HI>Cursed is be that keeps back his Sword from blood;</HI> then He will reward those that ven∣ture their Lives in his cause.</P>
<P>Let us be sure that the War which we ingage in is <HI>the War of the Lord,</HI> that which He approves of and calls us unto, and then if we have a sin∣cere respect to his Glory, in case we should loose our Lives in the battel, that will make us <HI>Martyrs:</HI> And we may then Expect the Crown of Martyrdom among those who for the sake of
<PB N="44" REF="001474_0047_0FB351FEF6E00CC8"/>
Christ have not Loved their Lives unto the Death. That Renowned Reformer <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> who lost his Life in a fatal battel between the Protestants and Papists in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> is to be reckoned a <HI>Martyr.</HI> The like is to be said of that famous Minister in <HI>France</HI> the Learned <HI>Chamier,</HI> who was killed with a Canon bullet when there was War in that Kingdom between Protestants and Papists.</P>
<P>Such Considerations as these ought to be an incouragement to those who are or may be called to <HI>Military Service.</HI> Wherefore be not faint-hearted, nor backward to any Expedition which the Providence of God shall call you un∣to. Play the Men for your People, and for the Cities of your God. If he shall make you or any of you instrumental Saviours to your Coun∣try▪ that a Mercy and what an Honour will it be. Wherefore, I Conclude with the words of King Jehoshaphat before-mentioned, 2 Chron. 19. 11. <HI>Deal Couragiously, and the Lord shall be with the Good.</HI></P>
