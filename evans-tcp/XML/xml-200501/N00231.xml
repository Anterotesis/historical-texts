<HEAD>To the second Church of Christ in Boston in New-England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearly beloved.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Lord Jesus said to a Church of his, <HI>as many as I love I rebuke and chasten;</HI> And this Church of his that I am now speaking unto, hath experienced solemn Rebukes from him in the way of his Providence, and that for a long Time; yea from our first constitution. It was upon the fifth day of the fourth Moneth, 1650. That the Foundation of this Temple was laid. There is but one stone of that first building that doth now re∣main among us. The Eyes of those so concerned, were (as some of you know) upon a dear Brother of mine, as desirous that he might have been over them in the Lord. But God had greater Service for him to do, in three other Nations successively, where he finished his Ministry. Wherefore, it was five years before the Church was setled with any Officers; and then the Lord gave them a Pastor and a Ruling Elder; which latter (though a good and choice spirited man) was in short time, by bodily infirmityes rendred uncapable of attendance upon the work of his place, for many years, until his death. Your Reverend Pastor, God continued as a blessing unto you, for a conside∣rable Time, even since, as well as before the Lord was pleased to call me (an unprofi∣table Creature) amongst you, so that (through the grace of Christ) we both lived to∣gether in love and peace for the space of eleven years; Albeit, his labours also, was God pleased to deprive you of, upwards of four years, before his course was finished in this world: so that I have been left alone (yet not alone, if the Lord be with me) in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Christ for these 8 years last past. That I feel the burthen which I am under, my fre∣quent calling upon you, to endeavour after a full supply of (especially, teaching) Offi∣cers in the Church, doth sufficiently testify; yet I must confess, that I am almost astoni∣shed, when I consider how the Lord hath disappointed hopes that way from time to time. There was one of our selves a <HI>Luke,</HI> a beloved Physitian, whom many (and for ought I know, all) of you had your thoughts upon, for improvement as a Ruling El∣der in this Church; &amp; it was in the purpose of my heart, the next Church-meeting, to have mentioned him to you for that end; but the Lord by an unexpected stroke, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him away from us; who were not worthy that such a blessing should be any longer continued unto us. Also, another (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faithful man) that was chosen, (though not ordai∣ned) by the Church unto some Office Relation therein, was immediately made unser∣viceable, from that day to this, by reason of those infirmities that still prevail over him. These are very solemn rebukes of Christ, the Lord help us to understand his mind and meaning therein. That awfull Dispensation of Divine Providence which befel us above three years agoe, when <HI>the house of God,</HI> (for so doth the Scripture call those places which are set apart for his worship, Psal. 74. 8. &amp; 83. 12) was burnt with fire, and above forty dwellings near adjoyning, all consumed in one fatal morning, I need not acquaint you with, for you have not forgotten it, and the marks and Remem∣brances of those Desolations are still dayly to be seen. You likewise know what a
<PB REF="000293_0003_0FA45AE79CEC1938"/>
terrible diseases the Lord hath since that, visited us with, whereby eleven persons (be∣sides many Children) belonging to this Church, have been removed from us, and some of them such as were an Ornament to the Church, as well as <HI>the glory of Christ,</HI> in respect of those spiritual gifts and graces that shined in them.</P>
<P>All these things, are Intimations from Heaven, that the Lord can easily <HI>remove the Candlestick,</HI> and that therefore it doth concern us as well as all (and much more then some) of the Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> to be renewing the Ingagements of our Souls unto God in Jesus Christ, that so he may be pleased to walk amongst us, and continue the Token of his gracious presence in the midst of us. I rejoyce then, that God (who knoweth I have often begged that he would do so) hath bowed all your hearts to consent and concur in that sacred Covenant which was lately and solemnly renew∣ed between the Lord, and each of our Souls.</P>
<P>And now (my Brethren, and the Lords people) the greatest work is yet to do, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>sincere endeavours to keep Covenant.</HI> To help and further you wherein, there is printed a faithful word, preached by that Worthy Person, who spake unto you in the Name of the Lord, on the day wherein you had so solemnly Renewed your choice of the Lord to be your God. Read and practise as there you are exhorted; It is not only a weighty, but a seasonable word; and I am glad that so many of you have desired that it might in such a way be made publick. The Lord write it in every heart; And give us to be ever mindful of that good profession which we have made before many witnesses, yea in the hearing of Heaven and Earth; Men, and Angels too, that came down from Heaven to observe that dayes solemnity, have beheld us avouching the Lord to be our God, and the Lord did that day avouch us, and our Children with us, to be his people. The Covenant we have entred into (many of you having so de∣sired in order to your being put in mind of the Obligation which is upon you) is pub∣lished here with; upon which account it will be like Joshua's stone, as, a monument of what hath been done, so, a witness against every man &amp; woman that shall not make Conscience to perform his vows. Let us remember (I do beseech you) that the Eyes of the World are now upon us more then ever; Men will be enquiring, what fruit is there of such a solemn Transaction? And if we do not walk as becometh the Gospel, others will be discouraged from following the Example that hath been set before them, and they that bear ill will to Zion will reproach Religion and the holy wayes of Christ. On which accounts, better we had not vowed, then that we should vow and not pay. But if the Lord Jesus help us to do his Commandments according to those vows of God which are upon us, undoubtedly some special blessing is near at hand; At pre∣sent we are under a divine probation; The Lord waits to see how we will acquit our selves. And in a more peculiar manner, that branch of the Covenant wherein we have engaged against the sins of the Times, ought most carefully to be remembred by us. Those evils are too many to be particularly mentioned in the Covenant: but therein we refer to what hath been declared by the Messengers of these Churches, that have convened to enquire into that matter.—Pride in Apparrel, is one of the sins of the Times, when persons goe above their Estates, &amp; degrees, or take up such Fashions as be∣come not serious Christians, It is a memorable passage, which I have met with, (and have sometimes put you in mind of) concerning certain Protestant Gentlewomen in <HI>Ireland</HI> that being robbed and stripped by the bloody and barbarous Papists, they called to mind <HI>the third Chapter of Isaiah,</HI> and said one to another, <HI>This is come upon us for our ex∣cess and pride in Apparrel.</HI> Wherefore, beware of this sin, and know that if any of you or your Children that are under your power, be hereafter found guilty before the Lord in that respect, God will look upon you as Covenant breakers in his sight.
<PB REF="000293_0004_0FA45AE8152FC460"/>
Again, Sinful drinking is one of the great sins of the Times: And <HI>Church-members</HI> have too many of them given occasion unto others to sin, and to speak evil of their ho∣ly profession, by an unnecessary frequenting Taverns, and spending many pretious hours, nay (which is lamentable to be spoken) dayes therein, which if they had spent half that time, in reading the Scriptures, and other good books, in prayer, and secret Communion with God, how happy would it have been for their Souls, and what a weight of glory should they have been partakers of, at the last and great day.—Then be watchful, and for the future, be not seen in such houses except when you have just cause &amp; call so to be. There are also Errors of the Times; Be zealous in bearing wit∣ness against them, love not little Errors, left God leave you to great ones. And charge your Children to abide in the Truth: It is a very sad thing, that <HI>the Rising Generation</HI> should be in danger of running into the mouths of Wolves, though in Sheeps cloath∣ing: Look diligently to your Children as to that thing also; Otherwise you remember not your Covenant, who have promised God in the presence of Angels and men, that <HI>you will do what in you is that your Children may be such as those that have the Lords Name put upon them ought to be,</HI> but this you do not, if you suffer them to go where they will be in danger to be corrupted and perverted.</P>
<P>One thing more, let me stir up your pure minds by way of Remembrance, concern∣ing it. We have in our Church Covenant, promised <HI>faithfully to watch over one ano∣thers Souls, and that more fully then heretofore.</HI> O what a World of Iniquity would be prevented, if this branch of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> were duely observed? For the Truth is, that most of those visible evils which <HI>Church-members</HI> are guilty of, arise from neglects here. Men can speak of one another faults behind their backs, but how few that do in love and faithfulness admonish them to their faces, when they see or hear that they do a∣miss. Do we not know what befel the Children of Israel, when they did not so strictly watch over Achan (who was a member amongst them) as they should have done? one man sinned, and did not wrath fall upon all the Congregation, Josh. 22. 20. We had need then to be careful and vigilant about this matter. Not that every failing should presently be made a matter of Church censure, but <HI>Scandals</HI> are by <HI>Discipline</HI> to be re∣moved, and lesser Errors may sometimes call for loving Reproofs, which is wisely ap∣plyed, will promote the Interest of holiness very much, in those, whom <HI>Holiness doth become for ever.</HI> Time was, when members of Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> could not do or speak evil, but one Brother or other would soon help them to see their Error. Let us remember those Times and <HI>do the first works.</HI> The good success of undertakings of this nature, depends much upon the manner and Spirit, wherewith they are managed: God would not have us to suffer sin to lye upon any Brother, yet he requireth, that In∣feriors should be respective in their deportment towards those that in gifts, place, Age, are their Superiors <HI>Ye younger submit your selves to the Elder, yea, all of you be sub∣ject one to another, and be cloathed with humility,</HI> 1 Pet. 5. 5.</P>
<P>I have no more at present, in this way to speak unto you; only be not discouraged, if you meet with censures from Men, for what you have done according to the will of God.—Not long since we did (and blessed be God that put it into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hearts) set apart a day for Fasting and Prayer, that we might cry to Heaven, for converting grace, to be poured down upon our Children. One would have thought that none pretending to Religion, would have disliked a work of that nature, yet what evil surmisings, and censures from some men, have we upon that account, been the subjects of? Why? It was a <HI>New practice;</HI> as some of old complained that Christ taught a <HI>new Doctrine.</HI> The more our sin and shame, if that which was long agoe our duty be but newly, or not at all practised; The like measure we must look for, in respect of our late <HI>solemn Transactions.</HI> 
<PB REF="000293_0005_0FA45AE8C38031C8"/>
But it is a comfortable thought, that if a man doth well, and hears ill for it; if he hath borne witness to the Truth, and against Sin, and promoted the interest of godliness in the hearts and lives of the Lords People, and is therefore hated, reviled, reproach∣ed, he meets with just such entertainment in the world, as did the holy Prophets and Apostles, and Martyrs; yea, and the Son of God himself. If then, God in his word doth declare that we have done well, let us not be discouraged in the way of duty; and the Lord doth so speak as to what we have done in promising (by the help of his grace and holy Spirit) that we will endeavour in all things to obey his voice. When the Children of Israel did so, the Lord said, <HI>They have well said in all that they have spoken.</HI> And O that it may appear, that we have made this Profession in sincerity, that there is such an heart in us, even an heart to fear the Lord our God, and keep all his Com∣mandments, alwayes, that it may be well with us, and with our Children for ever. So I rest,</P>

<HEAD>Returning unto God the great Con∣cernment of a Covenant People.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Hos. 14. 1.</BIBL> <HI>O Israel, Return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine Iniquity.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THese Words, are a gracious Invitation from Heaven, unto a sinfull backsliding People: in which Invita∣tion, there are four Particulars contained. 1. The Subjects concerned, <HI>Israel.</HI> i. e. the Lords Covenant People. The very name of <HI>Israel,</HI> did put them in mind of the Covenant that was between the Lord and them. They were descended from <HI>Israel</HI> an holy man, that was ominently interested in Gods Covenant, and did themselves profess that they were the Lords People. 2. Here is the matter of the Invitation, in that word <HI>Return;</HI> implying, that they had not been duly mindfull of that Covenant and ingagement unto God, which was upon them, and that therefore it did concern them to Repent, and in that way to <HI>Renew their Covenant.</HI> 3. Here is the Object unto which they should return, <HI>The Lord.</HI> In the Hebrew it is [<HI>gnad Jehovah,</HI> usque ad Dominum] <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">usque ad Dominum i. e. perfecte, non desistens, do∣nec Deum con∣tingas. <HI>OEco∣lampadius</HI> in lo∣cum. Ita <HI>Mer∣cerus</HI> &amp; alii.</NOTE> <HI>even as far as unto the Lord:</HI> intimating, that they had departed farr from him, and that a continued and through Conversion was ne∣cessary. It was requisite, that they should not only begin to <HI>Re∣turn,</HI> but never leave Turning, until they were come quite over unto the Lord, so as to become wholly subject unto him in every thing. Even <HI>unto the Lord,</HI> who is here described from his Re∣lation unto them as <HI>their God, Thy God.</HI> Which also doth respect the Covenant between God and them, whereby God became theirs, and they His. Both expressions doe imply strong Mo∣tives 
<PB N="2" REF="000293_0007_0FA45AEAAE02B790"/>
unto Repentance. q. d. The Lord Jehovah, is an universal good, and the fountain of all mercies and good things, without whom there is no life, no happiness to be had or to be hoped for. Therefore Return unto him. And inasmuch as He is <HI>Thy God,</HI> He is gracious and willing to accept of thee, in case thou shalt unfeignedly Return unto Him. Therefore Return. 4. This duty is urged from the necessity of it, <HI>For thou hast fallen by thine iniquity</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Quoni<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m corru∣isti.</HI> Metaphora a caesis aut pal∣pantibus in te∣nebris loco sa∣lebroso, quos necesse est im∣pingere et corruere. <HI>Pa∣reus</HI> in Loc.</NOTE> q d. Thou art <HI>Fallen</HI> into a wofull pit of sin and mise∣ry, into a gulfe of destruction, and art not able to save thy self, so that there is no way left but this one, of Returning to thy God. Wherefore the Doctrine from the words, is,</P>
<P>Doctr. <HI>That when the Lords Covenant People are fallen by Iniquity, it doth highly concern them, to Return unto their God.</HI></P>
<P>There are three things may be enquired into for the clearing of this Doctrine, 1. What <HI>Falling</HI> in respect of Iniquity, it is, which the Lords People are subject unto? 2. What is implyed in this Returning which the Lord speaks of? 3. The Reason why the Lords People should Return unto him.</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>What</HI> Falling <HI>in respect of Iniquity is it, that the Lords People are subject unto?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>The Lords own People are subject to decayes of Grace.</HI> Indeed they that are sincere, cannot fall totally and finally, yet they may be subject to partial Apostasyes from God, and from his blessed wayes. They may be, and too often are, on the lo∣sing hand, as to the degrees and measures of Grace. There may be sad intermissions as to the timely actings &amp; exercise of Grace. The Spouse in the Canticles, confesseth that she was asleep. And all the Virgins, (wise as well as foolish) slept and slumbred. Mat. 25. 8. And it was said to the Church in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Thou hast <HI>left</HI> (though not wholly <HI>lost</HI>) thy first Love, and that therefore they should remember whence they were <HI>Fallen,</HI> and doe the first works. Rev. 2. 5. Intimating, that Grace was not so lively in them, nor were they so much in the practice of Religion, as some∣times they had been. Thus is it noted concerning Solomon, that in his <HI>Old age,</HI> when one would have thought, he should have walked most closely with God, <HI>His heart was turned after other Gods, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.</HI> 1. Kin. 11. 4, 6. And Asa was much declined in his latter time: which judicious Interpreters <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Sic <HI>Junim</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Malvenda.</HI></NOTE> take to be the true meaning and intendment of
<PB N="3" REF="000293_0008_0FA45AECE2B112B0"/>
that Scripture, 2 Chron. 17. 3. where it is said of Jehosaphat, that he <HI>walked in the first wayes of David his Father,</HI> so it is expressed in our Translation, but in the Hebrew, the words run thus, <HI>He walked in the wayes of David, of his father the first.</HI> Now Asa was Jehoshaphats Father, and his <HI>first wayes</HI> were better then his last. He acted so in his latter times, as we doe not read the like of any good man, mentioned in the Scripture: whence a judici∣ous Divine <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> on Act. 2. 37. P. 66<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> doth question whether Asa was indeed a godly man, and whether that expression of his <HI>Heart being perfect,</HI> doth intend any more, then his not being an Idolater, &amp;c. But sup∣posing him to have the root of the matter in him, it was a dread∣ful Fall into iniquity that he was subject unto: Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lords own Servants may possibly fall into scandalous ini∣quity:</HI> and that both as to Judgement and Practice. A godly man may for a time be sainted with a scandalous error: yea, with Heresy in his Judgement, albeit he cannot live and dye so without Repentance and Recovery. Hence, the Apostle said to the Corinthians, <HI>How say some among you, there is no Resurrection from the dead?</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 12. Whereas the denial of the Resurre∣ction is a fundamental error. Moreover, a godly man may be∣come guilty of scandalous practices, both against the first Table, as we see in Aaron, who was by the people perswaded and pre∣vailed with to set up the golden Calfe in the Wilderness: And in Peter, who was once guilty of cursing and swearing falsely. As also against the second Table, as we see in Davids Adultery, and in Noah's and Lot's being guilty of such Intemperance, as is in the Scripture mentioned concerning them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They that are the Lords People in respect of a visible Covenant Interest only, may fall totally and finally.</HI> I say they may <HI>Fall</HI> totally: For though special Grace shall not, yet com∣mon Grace may be <HI>wholly lost.</HI> Such Professors may degenerate into meer Formalists, even so as to become dead, sapless, &amp; life∣less altogether, even <HI>twice Dead.</HI> Jude 12. As having lost those Quicknings, and gracious Illuminations which once they had ex∣perience of. Yea, of forward <HI>Professors,</HI> they may become bit∣ter <HI>Persecutors.</HI> Thus concerning Saul, that which he had was taken from him, his gifts and common graces withered; the Spi∣rit of the Lord departed from him, and an evil spirit took posses∣sion of him, that he became a most malignant Persecutor of holy 
<PB N="4" REF="000293_0009_0FA45AECF427FD60"/>
David, whom once he had loved and honoured. And <HI>Joush,</HI> when a young man, was very forward and zealous in the wayes of God, but after the Death of his Uncle, under whom he had his education he did persecute the Prophet <HI>Zachary</HI> (his next Cou∣zen) unto Death, for bearing witness against his and the Peoples Apostasy. And Alexander the Copper smith, became a bitter &amp; bloudy enemy to Paul, 2 Tim. 4. 14. &amp; yet it is <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic Crotius Fstius</HI> &amp; alii in 2 Tim. 4. 14.</NOTE> conceived that that Alexander was the same, who when time was, stood up in the defence of, and shewed himself willing to suffer with that holy Apostle, Act. 19. 33. Yea, such Professors as are Hypocrites in Heart, may <HI>Fall</HI> finally as well as totally. The Apostle saith concerning <HI>Demas, He hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.</HI> 2. Tim. 4. 10. Which is the very description of an unre∣generate man. 1. Joh. 2. 15. Nor doth the Scripture say any thing of his <HI>Return:</HI> but in <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dorotheus</HI> in Synops<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Ecclesiastical Story, he is reported to be one that lived and died an Idolater. Nay, such Professors may possibly become guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, which is alwayes attended with final Impenitency. They that have been enlightened, and had some tast of the heavenly gift, may fall away so as that it shall be impossible to renew them by Repentance, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. So true is that word of Christ, <HI>From him that hath not, shall be taken away that which he hath,</HI> he that hath not true Grace, that common grace which he hath, he is in danger of losing it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Lords People may fall under heavy Judgements because of their Iniquity.</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Impegisti. h. e. incidith in multas &amp; gra∣ves Calamita∣tes. <HI>Drusius</HI> in Locum.</NOTE> There is a falling <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Iniquity, and a falling <HI>by,</HI> for, or because of iniquity. Doubtless both are intended in the Text. Sore breaking Judgements are expressed in the Scrip∣tures, by that of a miserable <HI>Fall,</HI> Hos. 5. 5. <HI>Israel and Ephraim shall</HI> Fall <HI>in their iniquity, Judah also shall</HI> Fall <HI>with them:</HI> Israel, or Ephraim, h. e. the ten Tribes, had the worst Fall, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in re∣spect of the Assyrian Captivity, they Fell so as never to rise a∣gain: But Judah Fell also, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> under that Judgement of the Babylonian Captivity. The saddest temporal Judgements and Desolations, may possibly overtake the People of God, inasmuch as <HI>their</HI> Sins are most dishonourable to his blessed Name. We hear the Church complaining. <HI>Is there any Sorrow like unto my Sorrow, where with the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce Anger.</HI> And the Prophet Daniel saith, <HI>Under the whole heaven 
<PB N="5" REF="000293_0010_0FA45AEE57CD4300"/>
hath not been done, as hath been done unto Jerusalem,</HI> Now when it is so, <HI>Iniquity</HI> is the cause of it. Isa. 3. 8. <HI>Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is</HI> [Fallen] <HI>because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Lords People may</HI> Fall <HI>from their visible Church estate.</HI> So did Israel, Jer. 3. 8. <HI>When back sliding Israel committed Adulte∣ry, I put her away, and gave her a bill of Divorce.</HI> As for the ten Tribes, God hath called them <HI>Loammi,</HI> and written over them <HI>Lo-ruhama,</HI> saying, He would no more have mercy them on. Hos 1. 6, 9. And some Learned men <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="marg">De Israelitis qui per cap∣tivitatem Assyriam transpor∣tati sunt, dicendum est, eos partim in Gentiles degene∣rasse, partim Judaicis Syna∣gogis se adjunxisse, et cum <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is coalluisse. <HI>Voet.</HI> Disput. de Convers.

The Jews also are deprived of their Church estate: the Kingdome is taken from them, and given to the Gentiles, h. e. The Church of God (which is his Kingdome) is not now to be found amongst them, but among the Gentiles, who are planted in their Room. Hence, the Apostle speaketh of their <HI>Fall,</HI> Rom. 11. 11 12. inasmuch as they are <HI>Fallen</HI> from their Relation to God as his visible <HI>Covenant People.</HI> And the like hath hapned unto ma∣ny particular Gospel Churches, in these dayes of the New-Te∣stament: witness all the Churches in Asia. In some places in the lesser Asia, where once glorious Churches were seen, at this day, there is not so much as one Christian. So in <HI>Ephesus;</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aodicea,</HI> not an house, not a man to be seen.

And there was once a famous Church in <HI>Rome;</HI> but the Lord hath long since given her a bill of Divorce: And therefore Paul spoke like a Pro∣phet, when he said to the Church of <HI>Rome, Behold the goodness, &amp; severity of God, on them which</HI> Fell <HI>severity; but towards thee good∣ness, if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise thou shalt be cut off.</HI> Rom. 11. 22. Nor is there any particular Church in the world, but this may in time befall it. Never any Church enjoyed such

a Priviledge as that of <HI>Indefectibility,</HI> or impossibility of loosing their Church estate, which the <HI>Romanists</HI> do vainly pretend unto. Churches may degenerate, so as to lose that which is the true <HI>Matter</HI> of a Church, sc. visible <HI>Saints. The faithfull City may be∣come an Harlot: It was full of Judgement, Righteousness lodged in it, but now Murtherers. Isa.</HI> 1. 21. And they may lose that which is the <HI>Form</HI> of a Church, sc. <HI>Covenant</HI> with God and one another. Those two Staves, <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Bands,</HI> may be broken, Zech. 11. 10, 14. Or, if Churches should not degenerate as to their Prin∣ciples, they may be unchurched other wayes, and by other means e. g. By Divisions: An House (so a <HI>Church,</HI> which is an <HI>House</HI> of God) divided cannot stand. Or, the Lord may remove Instru∣ments whereby the affairs of his Kingdome in this or that place are managed. Sometimes the plucking up of one Pillar, maketh way for the whole house to Fall speedily and irrecoverably. Or a Storm of Persecution may arise, which shall blow the Lights out of the Candlesticks, yea and overset the Candlesticks too. The Church had like to have been carried away with that Flood of the <HI>Arrian</HI> Heresy and Persecution, Rev. 12. 15. In <HI>Austins</HI> time, whilst he was yet living, all the Churches in <HI>Africa,</HI> (ex∣cepting three) <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">v. <HI>Austin'</HI>s Life. P. 159, 160.</NOTE> were laid waft by the barbarous <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> whom the Lord let loose upon them, Yea, and so it was with the old Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">Se my Bro∣thers Defence of the Prote∣stant Religion against Pope∣ry. P. 13.</NOTE> they were (about 400. years after Christ) cut off by the sword of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> and another people, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> those whom we call <HI>Italians,</HI> substituted in their room. Like as the ten Tribes being fallen to Idolatry, were destroyed by the Assyrians, and <HI>Samaritans</HI> placed in their stead.</P>
<P>We come then to the second Enquiry, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>What is implyed in this</HI> Returning <HI>which the Text speaks of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is the same with <HI>Repentance.</HI> Sin is a departing from God, but Repentance is a <HI>Returning</HI> to Him again. Where∣fore Repentance is often expressed in the Scripture by that of <HI>Turning</HI> and <HI>Returning</HI> unto the Lord and by that of <HI>Conversi∣on,</HI> the Phrase being a <HI>Metaphor</HI> taken from those that are gone out of the right way, but doe Return back again into the way wherein they should goe. <HI>Repentance</HI> is nothing else but a <HI>Tur∣ning from all Sin unto God.</HI> It implyeth a change of the whole man. The mind is renewed. As in <HI>Returning,</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg">v. Dr. <HI>Sibs</HI> on Hos. 14. P. 10.</NOTE> there is a 
<PB N="7" REF="000293_0012_0FA45AEF4D47FA88"/>
change of the posture of the Body, so where there is Repentance the mind is bent quite another way. It was looking Sin-ward, Earth ward, Hell-ward, but now is fixed upon God, and Christ, and Heaven. In <HI>Returning</HI> the further a man goeth from a place, the lesser doe things seem that he hath left behind him, so in Re∣turning to God, the more a man doth <HI>Return,</HI> the world &amp; the va∣nityes of it seem little, yea as nothing to him. Again, <HI>Repentance</HI> Implyes a great Turn in the heart &amp; affections, so that those sins and corruptions, which were most loved and delighted in, are become the most hatefull, as we see in <HI>Returning</HI> Ephraim, Hos. 14. 8. <HI>What have I any more to doe with Idols?</HI> Before his <HI>Return,</HI> nothing so dear as Idols, but after that, nothing more abomina∣ble. <HI>Repentance</HI> implyeth also, a change in a mans Actions and Conversation. The true Penitent is <HI>Turned</HI> into another way, Isa. 55. 7. <HI>Let the wicked for sake his way, and let him Return unto the Lord.</HI> He <HI>was</HI> in the way to Hell, but he <HI>is</HI> in the way to Heaven. He <HI>was</HI> going in the broad way, but <HI>is</HI> come about, and got into the narrow way, which leads to everlasting life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. <HI>But why should the Lords People Return unto Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I shall mention only that Reason implyed in the Text, namely, <HI>The Consideration of the holy and gracious Covenant which they are under.</HI> Return unto the Lord <HI>thy God</HI> O Israel: He is thy God, and therefore thou art to Return to Him. Therefore, this consideration of the Covenant is often used in the Scripture as an Argument to enforce Repentance, Jer. 3. 14. <HI>Turn O back∣sliding Children, for I am married unto you,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in respect of the Covenant which was between God and them. And the Apo∣stle calls upon the Jews to Repent and be Converted, Act. 3. 19. and presseth his Exhortation with this Argument, <HI>You are the children of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers,</HI> v. 25. So doe the Seals of the Covenant, ingage the subjects of them to repent and return unto the Lord more and more. Hence it is said of John, that he did <HI>baptize unto Repentance,</HI> Mat. 3. 112 because those whom he baptized, were thereby ingaged to pra∣ctise Repentance. Its true, that they who are in Covenant with God, are bound to walk closely with him and to be carefull that they doe not make work for Repentance. Nevertheless, in case they doe through Temptation fail and Fall, the <HI>Covenant</HI> doth ingage them to renew their Repentance, and to make hast to 
<PB N="8" REF="000293_0013_0FA45AF00CEF18A0"/>
Return unto the Lord again, when they have backsliden from Him. They that lye under their Falls, continue breaking the everlasting Covenant. Moreover, the Lord in the Covenant of Grace, declareth unto men, that he will pardon their Sins, in case they doe unfeignedly <HI>Return</HI> unto him. The Gospel is some∣times called the Covenant. It was prophesied concerning Christ, that he should <HI>confirm the Covenant with many for one week,</HI> h. e. for <HI>seven years,</HI> which is a <HI>Prophetical Week.</HI> The Lord Christ did himself <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="marg">L'empereur.</NOTE> preach the Gospel to the Jews for the space of three years and an half, and after that (as some observe) his A∣postles did offer the Gospel other three years, and something more, before ever they preached to the Gentiles. Thus was the <HI>Covenant</HI> confirmed for one week, Dan. 9. 27. Now the Gospel doth command men every where to Repent, and doth promise the Remission of Sins in case they doe so. And if they that are under the external offer of the Covenant only, are bound to re∣pent, how much more they that are indeed in Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>USE. Let us hence be exhorted, perswaded and prevailed with to Return unto the Lordour God.</HI> Return unto thy God O Israel, O <HI>New-England,</HI> for thou hast Fallen by thine iniquity.</P>
<P>Consider. 1. <HI>What cause we have every one of us, to be Return∣ing unto the Lord our God.</HI> Certainly we have need to be turning from sin &amp; from the world, yet more &amp; more. Repentance is the work of a Christian as long as he liveth in this world. There are many that are in a state of sin; an <HI>universal Repentance</HI> is of absolute necessity to every such Soul. There are others that are under the prevailing power of some special Corruption or Tem∣ptation, and they stand in need of a <HI>Particular Repentance.</HI> There∣fore Christ said to his Disciples, notwithstanding their being converted as to their <HI>State,</HI> Math. 18. 3. <HI>Except ye be Conver∣ted, ye shall not exter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</HI> meaning that except they were <HI>converted</HI> from that particular sin of Pride, which was then too apparent in them, they could not be saved. And are there not many particular Persons, that are under wo∣full decayes as to their spiritual estate? Alas! they are not the same men that they were thirty or forty years agoe: And what cause have such to be thinking of Returning to the Lord, from whom they have deeply revolted. Nay, is there not a general
<PB N="9" REF="000293_0014_0FA45AF19D7CD400"/>
Declension amongst Professors in <HI>New-England!</HI> May we not confess, as the Lords People sometimes did, Jer. 14. 7. <HI>Our Ini∣quities testifie against us, for our Back slidings are many.</HI> Again, that which is spoken, Jer. 2. 21. may in too sad a degree be ap∣plyed unto <HI>New-England, I planted thee a noble Vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate Plant of a strange Vine unto me.</HI> How did the Power of Godliness flourish in this Land, and in these Churches, when time was! But is it so at this day? Is there not a general decay as to the power of godliness? How have Christians left their first Love? It was an Expression in the Sermon preached on the day when this Church was gathered, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">By Mr. <HI>Sa∣muel Mather,</HI> my most dear, and now bles∣sed Brother.</NOTE> near upon thirty years agoe, <HI>It is too plain to be denied, that there is a dying Spirit in New-England to the wayes of God.</HI> If it were so then, how much more now? Men have forgot their Errand into this Wilderness, <HI>What came ye into the Wilderness to see?</HI> It hath often and truely been said, That <HI>New-England</HI> differs from other <HI>outgoings of our Nation,</HI> in that Religion was the design of our Fathers in transporting them∣selves and Familyes into this waft and howling Wilderness. But men are <HI>now</HI> pursuing a worldly Interest, with their whole hearts. The things of God, and the great Concernments of his Holy Kingdome, are not sought after in the first place. If the body of the present standing <HI>Generation,</HI> be compared with what was here forty years agoe, What a sad Degeneracy is evident to the view of every man, that hath his heart exercised, in discerning things of this nature?</P>
<P>Consider 2. <HI>How solemnly God hath been calling upon us to Re∣turn.</HI> And that more wayes then one. By lesser and greater Judgements. The Lord hath come upon us, as a moth, and after that as a Lion, in tearing wrath, and furious Judgements that have rent &amp; born down all before them. When lighter Afflictions would not do, the Lord hath made bare his Arm against us, brandishing a glittering Sword, making it bright for the slaugh∣ter, yea, &amp; drunk with blood, &amp; <HI>the voice of the Lord</HI> was in it call∣ing aloud from Heaven, <HI>Return unto thy God, O New-England; for thou hast Fallen by thine Iniquity.</HI> The Lord hath also sent the de∣stroying Angel among us, with a besom of destruction, whereby many hundreds were swept away into the Land of darkness. Ah! poor <HI>N-England;</HI> Ah! poor <HI>Boston;</HI> wilt thou not yet hear, &amp; turn 
<PB N="10" REF="000293_0015_0FA45AF2657BB7E8"/>
and live? Once more; The Lord hath fallen upon us of late, and rendred his Rebukes in flames of Fire. May not we call the Name of this place <HI>Taberah,</HI> because the Fire of the Lord hath burnt a∣mongst us? Come and behold the desolations which the Lord hath made. Bewaile the burning which the Lord hath kindled. What is <HI>the voice of the Lord</HI> in all these solemn dispensations, if this be not it? <HI>O New-England, and thou Boston especially, Return unto the Lord thy God, for thou hast fallen by thine Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>And O Congregation, hear the Word of the Lord. We in this Congregation, in a more peculiar manner, have been under solemn and awakening calls from Heaven. When the Vessel was blown up in the harbonr five years agoe, and several desireable persons lost their lives, what a solemn blow was that. The Lord hath made aweful breaches upon us. One of this Church <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Lake.</HI></NOTE> and a most desireable and useful man, that dyed by the Sword of the Heathen: and some by <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Brack∣enbury,</HI> &amp; seve∣ral other hope full and desira∣ble Persons.</NOTE> the late mortal Conta∣gion, and divers, that by other providences have been ta∣ken away from us. God hath thinned our glory. And do we not remember the dismal Fire that was in this part of the Town a∣bove three years agoe, when <HI>this house</HI> was most desolate; <HI>the house wherein we have been wont to praise the Lord, was burnt with fire;</HI> and this Candlestick was then under aweful shakings. Some ob∣serve, <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Fullers</HI> Ser∣mon on Rev 2. 5.</NOTE> that God useth to <HI>move</HI> the Candlestick, before he doth quite <HI>remove</HI> it. Truly, God hath been <HI>moving</HI> this Candle∣stick, and I must needs solemnly declare, that it looketh like an ominous sign, that the Lord doth intend at last, to remove and break this Candlestick, if there be not a returning to him. Let us not be high minded, but fear. God can bring it to pass in one day, by one fatal stroke. O then, what cause have we, to say af∣ter the Lords people, <HI>come, let us Return unto the Lord, he hath torn, He hath smitten.</HI> Hos. 6. 1.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Lord hath been calling upon his people in this Wilderness, by his Word and faithful Ambassadors, by whose mouth he hath threatned aweful Judgements, except we repent. The watchmen of Ephraim that have been with God, have blown the Trumpet, and given the Alarm. Not only by some who are yet alive, but <HI>by the former Prophets,</HI> who have finished their course, and are gone to receive their Crown, the Lord hath been speaking and solemnly warning this people. O <HI>New England,</HI> 
<PB N="11" REF="000293_0016_0FA45AF2F7EA7018"/>
the day of thy Watch-men is come upon thee; even the day which thy Watch-men have told thee was coming. How inex∣cusable then shall we be, if we do not return? And the Lord hath very lately said, He would try one experiment more, with a sin∣ful people, <HI>it may be they will hear.</HI> He hath therefore so ordered by his Providence, as that the Messengers of these Churches here met together in his Name, to enquire into the causes of that dismal displeasure, which hath been written against us, in fiery and bloody Characters; and to fix upon Scripture expedients for Reformation. If what cometh in that way, <HI>and the voice of the Lord</HI> in it, be despised and rejected, we may fear, that there is a <HI>woful day,</HI> not far off. It was a serious and weighty word which a <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Natha∣niel Collins,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Middletown</HI> on <HI>Connection.</HI></NOTE> faithful Minister of Christ, who liveth in another Colony, not long since expressed in a great Assembly, <HI>Your hearing the mind of God, declared by the</HI> Synod, <HI>will be a signal Testimony of an humbled People; but if you will not hear what is so presented to you, I testifie unto you in the Name of the Lord, it may be written over your doors,</HI> They are not humbled unto this day.</P>
<P>Consider. 3. <HI>As yet there hath not been that Returning unto the Lord which ought to be, and which He doth expect from this Peo∣ple.</HI> The generality of men doe not frame their doings to Turn unto the Lord. If they <HI>Return,</HI> it is not to the most High. It was a sad word which the Lord took up against his People of old Hos. 11. 7. <HI>My People are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt Him.</HI> They that did <HI>Return</HI> when called upon thereunto, were so few, as that they seemed <HI>none at all.</HI> I doubt not, but that (through grace) there are many particular persons among us, unto whom God hath sanctified his awfull Dispensations, in order to their effectu∣al Conversion and Reformation: but our misery is, in that there is no general Turning from Sin and World, unto God in Jesus Christ. Alas, that it may be said as in Am 4. <HI>I have with holden the rain from you, yet have you not returned unto me saith the Lord. I have smitten you with blasting and Mildew: yet have ye not returned unto me: I have sent among you the Pestilence, after the manner of Egypt, your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; yet you have not Returned unto me.</HI> He that was proud, is so stil; he that was a Worldling, is so stil, he that was a Pot-compani∣on, &amp; that did haunt Ale houses or Ordinaryes, doth so stil. That 
<PB N="12" REF="000293_0017_0FA45AF3CF2A4B30"/>
which is spoken of the Children of Israel, is sadly true concern∣ing the most of men amongst us, Psal. 78. 32. <HI>For all this, they sinned still.</HI> Devouring Plagues had been round about them, <HI>for all this they sinned still.</HI> Most wonderfull mercies and emi∣nent deliverances did the Lord vouchsafe unto them: <HI>For all this they sinned still.</HI> And is it not so with us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> War, Mortality, Fires have been amongst us; Yet men continue sinning still. The Lord hath by a Miracle of mercy, restored peace and health to the Land, that the inhabitant thereof is not sick: yet men con∣tinue sinning still.</P>
<P>Consider. 4. <HI>What blessed encouragement we have to be Return∣ing unto God.</HI> He had a delight in our Fathers, and hath chosen us their children to be his People. He is <HI>Our</HI> God still. He hath not written over us <HI>Lo-ammi</HI> and <HI>Lo-ruhamah.</HI> As yet we have a day of Grace. As particular persons, so Churches and Congre∣gations have their <HI>day of Grace.</HI> Christ said unto Jerusalem, (and be wept when he said it) O <HI>that thou hadst known in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace,</HI> Luke 19. 42. And O that in <HI>this New-Englands Day,</HI> we knew the things that belong unto our peace, before they be hid from our eyes. We may be hap∣py, if we have an heart to consider it. The Lord we see, is loth to make us as Admah, to set us Zeboim. He is not willing to give up his own Interest here: He waits to be gracious: He waits to see if we will Return unto him, that so we may be fit for mer∣cy, and then we shall have it. O then, let us return <HI>before</HI> the Decree bring forth, <HI>before</HI> the day pass as the chaff, <HI>before</HI> the day of the Lords anger come upon us. Therefore,</P>
<P>Consider 5. <HI>The good that will follow in case we doe Return.</HI> If we Return to the Lord, He will Return unto us, with mercies &amp; blessings more then ever. Mal. 3. 7. <HI>Even from the dayes of your Fathers, you are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them: Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> The Lord will then make it appear that he is <HI>our God,</HI> &amp; that he is <HI>Jehovah.</HI> As he was known unto his People in the years of ancient Generations by his Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> when he did fulfil &amp; give <HI>Being</HI> to his gracious Promises. Mark how the Prophet Daniel speaketh, Ch. 9. v. 13. <HI>that we might turn from our Ini∣quityes, and understand thy truth.</HI> q. d. The Lord hath promised to save and bless those that Turn from their iniquities: and if we 
<PB N="13" REF="000293_0018_0FA45AF47723A578"/>
had done so, we should have known by gracious experience, the truth of Gods word. So then, if we Return, the benefit will be our own: Good will come unto our selves thereby: and to o∣thers too. Ezek. 18. 30. <HI>Repent and turn your selves,</HI> so we read it, but the Hebrew word <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> [<HI>Jehashibu</HI>] signifieth, <HI>to make to be Converted,</HI> Repent and make others to be Converted. It is al∣wayes the property of true Repentance, that it maketh men en∣deavour that others may repent too. And usually, If one Re∣pent, another followeth: Examples are very powerfull: <HI>your Zeal</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>hath provoked many,</HI> 2 Cor. 9. 2. If one Church set a good example, it may be, many will follow: And then, O what glory will come to the blessed Name of God. If a People should become <HI>all Righteous,</HI> the Lord is <HI>glorified,</HI> Isa. 60. 21. And what joy doth this cause in heaven? If there be joy in Heaven, when one Sinner Returns unto God; how much more, when a whole Church shall become zealous and Repent, and in∣gage themselves to a more close and holy walking with God, then ever before?</P>
<P>Consider. 6. <HI>We must of necessity Return unto the Lord our God.</HI> As ever we desire to escape destruction, this concerns us. What an awfull Scripture is that, Jer. 15. 7. <HI>I will destroy my People, saith they Return not from their wayes.</HI> It is not being visibly the Lords People; it is not the external enjoyment of spiritual Privi∣ledges that can secure or save us, except we Return: We have no other way left in heaven or on earth, but this. We have many enemies, not only in Hell, but on Earth, ready to swallow us up, if the Lord be not on our side. If God be not our Friend, we are the miserablest people under heaven: And we have little reason to expect, that the Lord will stand by us, if we will not Return unto him. Either we shall have no deliverance, or none in mercy, if we Return not. It's true, that God to shew his So∣vereignty, doth sometimes save an Apostate People, as he did Is∣rael in the dayes of Jehoahaz, and of Jeroboam the second, 2 Kin. 13. 5, 6. &amp; 14. 27. But such Deliverances leave men the more inexcusable, and usually end in the saddest destructions and desolations, except there be Repentance.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But what shall be done that so we may Return unto the Lord our God?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Let us</HI> now <HI>up and be doing.</HI> The longer a person or
<PB N="14" REF="000293_0019_0FA45AF562A00B50"/>
a People shall defer their Repentance, the harder work will they find of it: Jer. 13. 23. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then may ye also doe good, that are accustomed to doe evill.</HI> Therefore the Lord urgeth men unto present Obedi∣ence: Jer. 25. 5. <HI>The Lord hath sent unto you all his Servants the Prophets, rising early and sending them,—they said, Turn ye again</HI> [Now] <HI>every one from his evill way, and from the evill of his do∣ings.</HI> Ephraim is an unwise son when he stayeth long in the birth. Is not Repentance a good work? And are not the <HI>Ex∣pedients</HI> in order thereunto good to be attended? Then the sooner we doe it, the better. It was sometimes said to the Elders of Judah, <HI>Why are ye the last to bring back the King to his house?</HI> 2 Sam. 19. 11. Every Church is an house of David (i. e. of Christ the true David) Why should any of us, especially, why should any Churches seek to be the last that doe by Renewing their Re∣pentance and solemn Ingagements unto the Lord, endeavour to establish Christs Throne amongst us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us pray and promise better Obedience.</HI> O cry to Heaven as Ephraim did, <HI>Turn thou me and I shall be turned.</HI> Men say, they cannot turn themselves. Must they sit stil then, &amp; doe nothing, under pretence that God must do all? Nay, but they must stir up themselves, and call upon God. It is a precious Truth, that the Lord has in his gracious Covenant, promised that his people shall return unto him: Nevertheless, he saith, <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them,</HI> Ezek. 36. 37 Nor is it enough for us to <HI>pray,</HI> but we must, (though not in our own strength) <HI>promise</HI> better obedience. And this particular, doth not only suit with the solemn work, which we are now to attend, and which hath occasioned our being thus before the Lord this day: but it is the very direction, which God himself doth give un∣to his Israel in this Context, that so they might become a Return∣ed, Reformed people. <HI>Take with you words, and turn to the Lord.</HI> What words? even words of prayer, therefore it is ad∣ded, <HI>say unto him, take away all Iniquity,</HI> &amp;c. And words of pro∣mise too, <HI>so will we render the Calves of our lips.</HI> The Lord puts them upon promising, that they would live more to his praise and glory for the time to come, then ever they had done before. And accordingly we see them Renewing their Covenant, ver. 3. <HI>Ashur shall not save us, we will not say any more, to the works of our 
<PB N="15" REF="000293_0020_0FA45AF5ECD251C8"/>
hands, ye are our Gods.</HI> So that they engage against the special reigning sins of the Times, which they had been guilty of, and that for the future, they would endeavour to love God more, and to serve him better.</P>
<P>And that this <HI>Renewing of Covenant,</HI> is a duty incumbent upon these Churches, <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="marg">in a <HI>Sermon</HI> on Neh. 9. 38, published 3 years agoe.</NOTE> I have formerly shewed, and shall not now insist much upon it, especially considering, that there is a great voice out of the Temple calling unto it, I mean in respect of what the <HI>Messengers of the Churches,</HI> have lately and unanimously de∣clared to be the mind of Christ concerning this matter. The Truth is, <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Ser∣mon on Josh. 24. 22.</NOTE> that if there were no visible Apostasy amongst us, yet it might be good to Renew our Covenant with God, that so we may be the better able to stand our ground, if a Temptation to forsake the Truth should overtake us. The Children of Israel ser∣ved the Lord all the dayes of Joshuah, yet he put them upon <HI>Renewing their Covenant,</HI> that so they might be kept from Apo∣stasy for the future, Josh. 24. 27.</P>
<P>There seems to be an hour of Temptation coming upon <HI>all the World,</HI> i. e. upon the <HI>Churches</HI> of Christ <HI>dispersed throughout the World,</HI> Prov. 3. 8. And if so, these New English Churches, must expect a day of Trial are long, though what the particular Temp∣tation will be, is with God. Now for us, in the most solemn man∣ner, to Renew our Ingagements to the Lord, and one to another, is the way (by the grace of Christ) to stand fast in the Profession of the Faith, and order of the Gospel. There <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="marg">See Dr. <HI>Reynolds</HI> on Hos. 14. P. 71.</NOTE> is miserable per∣sidiousness in the Revolting hearts of men; upon which accounts, all Bonds that may be, are expedient and necessary. Yet I per∣ceive, that there are needless scruples and objections in the minds of men, against so good and holy a work.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some object, <HI>what need any particular sins be mentioned, must we tell the World of our particular sins?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. As for secret sins, which only God knoweth of, men ought not to declare them before the World; But such evils as are publick, they ought publickly and particularly to be engaged against. Thus when the Lords people renewed their Covenant in Nehemiahs Time. They did engage particularly against those evils of unlawful Marriages, Oppression, Sabbath breaking, neg∣lect of Divine Institutions, &amp;c. which were the special prevailing iniquities of that Time and place, Neh. 10, 30, 31, 35. A general 
<PB N="16" REF="000293_0021_0FA45AF78732A2D8"/>
confession of sin, is not true Repentance, except there be this and that particular sin bewailed before the Lord. No more are ge∣neral promises for Reformation sufficient.</P>
<P>Object. 2. Some say, <HI>our Fathers forty years agoe, did not pra∣ctise any such Renewing of Covenant, as that which is now urged, nor did they approve of it.</HI></P>
<P>Answ. If when Asa called upon the Lords people to attend this work, they should have put it of, by saying, in the dayes of David (your great grand-Father) there was no such thing practi∣sed, and therefore why should we do it now? Had it not been ca∣sy to Answer, the state of things then and now doth greatly dif∣fer. There is more cause, and a greater call, to attend such a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>luty now, then there was then, she like may be said in this case. There was not such Pride, Intemperance, Formality in Religion, &amp; other evils amongst Professors, as is now to be seen, and therefore not so much need to engage against those sins for∣merly, as at this day. Nor is it truly said that this is any <HI>new Practice,</HI> or not approved of by those, who were Instruments in the hand of Christ, in planting these Churches. For they pro∣ceeded much upon this Principle, <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg">v. <HI>Norton</HI> in Resp. ad Ap∣pol. c. 2. &amp; <HI>Ames.</HI> Theol. I. 1. Cap. 32. and <HI>Parker</HI> de Eccles. Polit. Cap. 3. P. 172, 173.</NOTE> <HI>That Renovation of Cove∣nant is an expedient for Church Reformation.</HI> And their practice was accordingly. They were in Covenant with God, before they knew this Land; and therefore what they did here, was a Renew∣ing of Covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. <HI>But what shall become of the old Covenant?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. If when Moses called upon the Children of Israel to Re∣new their Covenant in the plains of Moab, Deut. 20. 1. it should have been said, but what shall become of the old Covenant, which we entred into at Horeb, forty years agoe? Would it not have been replyed, that Covenant is hereby, not nullified but confirmed. So is that Covenant which we are now engaging our selves unto the Lord by, a confirmation of what hath been for∣merly done by us. There is not any one particular mentioned in this Covenant, which is a <HI>new</HI> duty, or not required in the ever∣lasting Covenant, nor indeed any thing but what was contained in that expression of the Covenant formerly. <HI>We promise to cleave unto the Lord as our God, &amp; to him only, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, as our only Priest, Prophet and King.</HI> He that observeth the first and great Commandment, can not but keep all the rest. 
<PB N="17" REF="000293_0022_0FA45AF8B679E470"/>
So if this general and comprehensive Covenant be duely remem∣bred and observed, no more is required. The particulars which this Covenant is branched out into, do but explain and so confirm our former Ingagements. And it is of great advantage, to have the Covenant thus particularly expressed and explained, that so any one may see what they are bound unto.</P>
<P>Object. 4. <HI>Although the Old-Testament speaketh much about Renewing Covenant, yet we read nothing of that matter in the New∣Testament.</HI></P>
<P>Answ. And is the Old-Testament become Apocrypha in these dayes? Men consider not, that by this Objection they strike at the Foundation of all these Churches, &amp; introduce a principle, that is destructive to the very <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>being</HI> of a <HI>Congregational Church.</HI> Where doth the New-Testament in so many express words speak of any explicite Church Covenant? The New Testa∣ment is more sparing, as to the mentioning of things, abundantly insisted on in the Old-Testament. When the Anabaptists object, that the New-Testament faith nothing of Childrens right to the Seal of the Covenant; do we not rightly answer them, but their right thereunto is plainly asserted in the Old-Testament, and no where repealed in the New? even so, we have Examples for <HI>Renovation of Covenant</HI> in the Old Testament, and it is no where condemned in the New. But as the Judgements which befel the Lords people of old were recorded for our Admonition, so the course which they took, in order to Reformation, is writ∣ten for our Instruction and Imitation, 1 Cor. 10. 11. It is a great Truth, that practices mentioned in the Old Testament, not pe∣culiar to that <HI>Poedagogi,</HI> but of moral and perpetual Equity, do bind men in the dayes of the Gospel; and of this sort, is the Re∣novation of Covenant, with the Lord our God. Nor must it be granted that the New-Testament is a stranger to any such pra∣ctice. For the Jews that we read of in the second Chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> were in Covenant with God, before <HI>the Time of Refor∣mation</HI> came, as the Apostle speaketh, Heb. 9. 10. yet it is past doubt, that when three thousand were added to them, (i. e. to the Church at Jerusalem) they renewed their Covenant with God, and with the Lord Jesus Christ. And I would desire those that make this Objection, to give us an Instance of any Gospel Church which being under <HI>spiritual declensions,</HI> was recovered from their
<PB N="18" REF="000293_0023_0FA45AF9035DBD78"/>
backslidings, without Renewing their Covenant. When the Churches in Asia, (some of them) <HI>had fallen by their Iniquity,</HI> the Lord Jesus called upon them to Repent and Return, and that implyeth that they ought to attend Scripture expedients for Reformation; of which this Renovation of Cove∣nant is none of the least.</P>
<P>Object. 5. Some say, <HI>The Covenant is so strict, we shall make men afraid to joyn to the Church?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Covenant is no stricter then God hath made it, who saith un∣to every one that hates to be Reformed, <HI>What hast thou to doe to take my Co∣venant into thy mouth?</HI> In the Covenant which we are about to Renew, there is nothing expressed but plain clear dutyes, required in the Gospel. They that are sincere will not be afraid of Church Communion, because they must be under obligation to practise according to the Scripture. And as for those that are not sincere, they are better out of the Church then in it. It was a mercy to the primitive Church, <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="marg">Read Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> of the holiness of Church-mem∣bers.</NOTE> when as those that were not true Believers <HI>no man durst joyn himself unto them.</HI> Act. 5. 13, 14. The fewer Hy∣pocrites (who are loth to come up to the practice and power of godliness) in a Church, the better. Though such will <HI>creep in unawares,</HI> Jude. 4. yet we should not let them in, if we knew them to be such. <HI>Sincere</HI> Professors are <HI>Golden</HI> Members; and therefore to have Churches consist of such, as much as may be, is the way to have them continue <HI>Golden Candlesticks.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 6. <HI>This Covenant is either of Grace or of works: if of works, we dare not meddle with it: if of Grace, why should we Renew it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> How is it possible for any understanding Christian to imagine, that a <HI>Covenant</HI> made with God through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is the Covenant of works, or that a Covenant wherein men profess themselves <HI>unable</HI> to doe any thing <HI>of themselves,</HI> and that wherein they fail in their Obedience, they look for pardoning mercy through the <HI>Mediator,</HI> is a Covenant of works? All which is true with reference unto the Covenant before us. And whereas it is said that men under the Covenant of Grace, need not to Renew their covenant∣ing with God, nothing can be spoken more contrary to Scripture, or to the practice of Saints. Was not Jacob under the Covenant of Grace? Was he in a state of Salvation by virtue of any other Covenant then that of Grace? Yet in the time of his distress, he Renewed his Covenant, in giving himself up to God, and promising to cleave unto the Lord as <HI>his God.</HI> Gen. 28. 20. Doth not Faith in Christ give men an Interest in the Covenant of Grace? Then as often as Believers renew their closing with Christ, they doe on their parts, Renew their Covenant. But they that doe already believe, may and should again and again give themselves up to the Lord Jesus. Joh. 2. 11. Christians, every time that they worship the Lord Jesus Christ, and more especially in that Ordinance of the Lords Supper, doe implicitly <HI>Renew</HI> their <HI>Consent</HI> to the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> And if an implicit <HI>Renovation</HI> of Covenant be necessary, then sometimes to doe it after the most solemn and express manner that may be, will certainly tend to the glory of God, and to the good of Souls.</P>
<P>Obj. 7. In the last place some object, <HI>What should we Renew Covenant for, we shall not keep Covenant when we have done?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That's no good Objection. It makes me think of the man whom 
<PB N="19" REF="000293_0024_0FA45AF9F6D6E8F0"/>
<HI>Luther</HI> speaketh of, that had made many Vows to God, but broken them all; and therefore he resolved, that for the future, he would live at a loose end, and covenant no more, that so he might be at the more liberty to sin. Is it so with any of your souls? Then in the Name of God, how can you, how dare you approach unto the Table of the Lord? I solemnly declare unto you in the Name of the Lord Jesus, that if any man or woman amongst you, be secretly in league with sin, and therefore unwilling to be further ingaged to the holy and glorious God, you will eat and drink Judge∣ment to your selves, and the oftner you come to that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Ordinance, the greater will your Damnation be at the last day. Let us every one be sincere and watchfull, then shall we <HI>Keep Covenant.</HI> 1. Be <HI>Sincere:</HI> let us not give up our Names only, but our Hearts unto God in Jesus Christ. It is recorded concerning the Lords Peo∣ple in the dayes of Asa, <HI>that they entered into a Covenant to seek the Lord God of their Fa∣thers, with all their heart and with all their soul,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 12. Let us be sure that our hearts be in this work: then shall we be like to keep Covenant when we have done; otherwise not. Good Josiah, when he renewed Covenant, he did it <HI>with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> 2 Chron. 34. 31. And thence he performed what he promised. But the People too generally did what they did, out of compliance with him, but their hearts were not in it, Jer. 3. 10. And therefore they quickly broke their Covenant with God, O then let us be sincere in this matter. 2. And <HI>Watchfull.</HI> For a sincere godly man may be guilty of great violations of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and by his iniquity in that respect, Fall un∣der the heavy judging hand of God; and all this for want of due <HI>Watchfullness.</HI> How have the Lords Servants come to Fall after such a fearfull manner, as some of them have done, and that soon upon the most solemn Ingagements unto God? But be∣cause they did not duely <HI>Watch,</HI> and take heed to their spirits lest they should deal treacherously. Peter renewed his Covenant with the Lord Jesus, when he promised never to forsake him, but to dye rather; and yet he presently acted contrary to that Ingagement, because he depended too much upon his own strength, and was not <HI>humbly watchfull</HI> as he ought to have been.</P>
<P>Lastly. <HI>Look up to Christ.</HI> O look unto Jesus: let us look unto him for pardoning mercy. He hath offered Sacrifice, whereby Attonement is made for the whole Con∣gregation. Look to Him for all supplyes of grace continually. He hath grave enough for us all. Joh. 1. 16. <HI>Of his fullness have we all received grace for grace.</HI> And what is all that can be done or thought of, without Christ? What are <HI>Vows</HI> and <HI>Covenants</HI> except Christ be in them? Alas! many poor souls, when outward or inward distress and anguish is upon them, they will vow and swear to God that they will never com∣mit such &amp; such sins any more: &amp; yet when strong temptations come, they break all bonds, &amp; their corruptions are as much unmortified as ever. Why? Because they pro∣mise in their own strength, and know not what it is by Faith to fetch supplyes of grace and strength from the blood, and from the Spirit of the Lord Jesus. We say in that <HI>Covenant,</HI> which we are here met before the Lord to ingage our souls in this day, that we will doe this and the other thing which God requireth <HI>[by the help of Christ]</HI> O remember that it may be by the Help of Christ, if we doe anything. And there∣fore let us depend upon God in Jesus Christ, to doe all our works in us and for us. <HI>Amen Lord Jesus!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Covenant which was unanimously con∣sented unto, is as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>WE, who through the exceeding Riches of the Grace and Pa∣tience of God, doe yet continue Members of this Church; being now assembled in the holy Presence of God, and in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; after humble Confession of our manifold breaches of Covenant before the Lord our God, and earnest supplication for pardoning mercy through the blood of Christ; and deep acknowledgment of our great unworthiness to be own∣ed as the Lords Covenant People: Also acknowledging our inability to keep Cove∣nant with God, or to perform any spiritual duty, unless the Lord Jesus doe enable us thereunto by his Spirit dwelling in us: And being awfully sensible, that it is a dread∣full thing, for sinfull dust and ashes, personally to transact with the infinitely glorious Majesty of Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Barth; We do, in humble confidence of his gracious assistance, and acceptance through Christ, each one of us, for our selves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as a Church of the living God, explicitly renew our Covenant with God, and one with another, in manner and form following. That is to say,</P>
<P>We do give up our selves unto that God, whose Name alone is Johovah, Father, Son, and holy Spirit, as the only true and living God; And unto our blessed Lord Je∣sus Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our only Saviour, Prophet, Priest, and King over our Souls, and only <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Covenant of grace; promising (by the help of his Spirit and grace) to cleave unto God as our chief good, and unto the Lord Jesus Christ by Faith, in a way of Gospel Obedience, as becometh his Covenant People for ever. We doe al∣so give up our Offspring unto God in Jesus Christ; avouching the Lord to be our God, and the God of our children: And our selves with our children to be his people; humbly adoring this grace of God, that we and our Offspring with us, may be look∣ed upon as the Lords.</P>
<P>We <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also give up our selves one unto another, in the Lord according to the will of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and binding our selves to walk together, as a right order∣ed Congregation and Church of Christ; in all the wayes of his Worship, according to the holy Rules of the word of God: promising in brotherly Love, faithfully to watch over one anothers Souls, and to submit our selves unto the Discipline and govern∣ment of Christ in his Church, and duely to attend the Seals, censures, or whatever Ordinances Christ hath commanded to be observed by his People, according to the order of the Gospel, so far as the Lord hath, or shall reveal unto us by his Word and Spirit.</P>
<P>And whereas, the Messengers of these Churches, who have met together in the Name of Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enquire into the Reason of the Lords Controversy with this his People, have taken notice of many provoking evils, as the procuring causes of the Judgements of God upon New-England, so far as we, or any of us have been guilty of sin in respect of any of them, we desire from our hearts to bewail it before the Lord, and humbly to entreat for pardening mercy, for the sake of the blood of the Everlasting Covenant.</P>
<P>And as an expedient unto Reformation of those, or whatever evils have provoked the eyes of Gods glory amongst us; We doe subjoyn unto our Church Covenant a further Engagement, whereby we doe, as in the presence of God, promise,</P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="000293_0026_0FA45AFB2E172DD8"/>1. That we will (by the help of Christ) labour every one of us, to Reform his own heart and life, by seeking to mortify all our Sins, and endeavouring to walk more closely with God, then ever we have done, and to uphold the power of godliness; and that we will continue to worship God in publick, private, secret, and this (as God shall help us) without Formality and Hypocrisie; and more fully and faithfully then heretofore, to discharge all Covenant dutyes one towards another in a way of Church Communion.</P>
<P N="2">2. We promise (by the help of Christ) that we will endeavour to walk before God in our houses, with a perfect heart and that we will uphold the worship of God there∣in continually, according as he in his word doth require, both in respect of Prayer, and reading the Scriptures, that so the word of Christ may dwell richly in us; And that we will do what in us lyeth, to bring up our Children for Christ, that they may become such, as they that have the Lords Name put upon them by a solemn dedica∣tion to God in Christ, ought to be; and that therefore we will (so far as there shall be need of it) Catechize them, and exhort and charge them to fear and serve the Lord, and endeavour to set an holy Example before them, and be much in Prayer for their Conversion and Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. We do further engage (the Lord helping of us) to do what in us is, that we may be pure from the sins of the Times, even those provoking Evils that have brought the Judgements of God upon New-England; And in our places to endeavour the sup∣pression thereof; and that we will make Conscience to walk so, as that we may not give occasion to others to sin, or to speak evil of our holy Profession.</P>
<P>Now that we may observe and keep this sacred Covenant, and all the branches of it inviolable for ever, we desire to deny our selves, to depend wholly upon the power of the eternal Spirit of Grace, and upon the free mercy of God, and upon the merit of Jesus Christ, and where we shall fail, there to wait upon the Lord Jesus for pardon, and for acceptance, and for healing, for his Names sake.</P>
