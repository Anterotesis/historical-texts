<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SOME <HI>Tears are past, since a</HI> Minister <HI>who Lived Fifty Miles from</HI> Boston, (<HI>and is since gone to his</HI> Everlasting Rest) <HI>Wrote to me, desiring, that I would print more of my Sermons, Because (as he said) they found great Acceptance in the Country; many Professing that they had been Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed by such of them is they had seen; If it were so, I acknowledge no

Honour is Due to me, or to any of my</HI> poor Performances; <HI>But unto that</HI> Free Grace, <HI>that dub some∣times give Favour unto them, that are not Men of Skill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>OLD Age has so</HI> Debilitated <HI>me that I have no Hopes of Preaching another Sermon. Besides my</HI> Right Hand <HI>is become</HI> Paralitical, <HI>and</HI> shakes <HI>after that manner that I can∣not Write any Long Discourse, which gives me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Supersede as <HI>from Preaching. I used to Write largely; tho' I bless GOD for my Memory. I never made use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies in the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lpil.</HI></P>

I look upon these as my</HI> Last Sermons. <HI>And therefore have Given them the Name of my</HI> Dying Legacy. <HI>Indeed since these 
<PB N="3" REF="002362_0003_0FDB126CE26D3B80"/>
Sermons were Preached I entertained the Congregation with another short Discourse, not Worthy the Name of a</HI> Sermon, <HI>so that (as I before said) I take these to be</HI> my Last.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> First Sermon <HI>that ever I Preached in</HI> Boston, <HI>was in the Year</HI> 1661, <HI>immediately upon my Coming from</HI> England. <HI>I was then in the Twenty-Second Year of my Age: And had been several Years a Preacher of the Gospel in other Parts of the World, and I have (through Grace) continued to Preach the</HI> Gospel of CHRIST <HI>here in</HI> Boston <HI>until the end of the Eighty-Third Year of my Age, which is above Sixty Years. But (which I rejoyce at) I have known many who have done more Good in a few Years then I (an Unprofitable Servant) may pretend unto in many.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I did (when I spoke my last unto the Dear People to whom I have these many Years been Preaching) Declare
<PB N="4" REF="002362_0004_0FDB127289914B88"/>
to them, that the greatest Affliction I had in this World, was that I could do no more Service for them, whom I Love more dearly than my Life. Now I can do no more God in this World, I desire to Dye and Go to a better: But I must Humbly and Pa∣tiently Wait GOD's Time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I would Gladly do some Good af∣ter I am Dead. I hope the Books I have Written will do Good unto some of the People of GOD, when I can neither Speak nor Write. This is my Hope concerning these poor plain Sermons. The LORD Grant that it may be so, and that CHRIST may be Glorified by them.</HI></P>

<P>IN the Prosecution of this Doc∣trine, I shall only speak unto Two Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT is implied in the Sal∣vation of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>HOW it appears that True Believers in CHRIST may be assured of the Salvation of their Souls.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="3" REF="002362_0005_0FDB12745B2F3E68"/>For Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Prem. <HI>THE Soul is put for the Whole Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Body and Soul.</HI> Man consists of these Two Essential Parts; a Humane Body and a Reasonable Soul, the Believer serves God with both, both with his Body and with his Soul▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. 20. <HI>Glorify God in your Body and in your Spirit, which are Gods.</HI> The Body is not Saved without the Soul, but the Soul is Saved without or before the Body; the Soul is present with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before the Body is. Thus <HI>Lazarus</HI> when Dying, his Soul was immediately in the Hands of Angels: And the Scripture speaks of the Souls or Spirits of Just Men made Perfect. It is said of <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he left this World, he was Gathered to his Fathers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to <HI>She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Noah,</HI> and to those Just Men that were gone out of the World before him.
<PB N="4" REF="002362_0006_0FDB12C3DFFE6E00"/>
God sent His Holy Angels to carry <HI>Abrahams</HI> Soul to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Salvation of the Soul implies a Deliverance from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Evil whatsoever.</HI> Psal. 121. 7. The <HI>Lord shall preserve thee from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Evil, He shall preserve thy Soul.</HI> The Preservation of the Soul implies a Preservation from all that Evil which Sin has brought on a Wo∣ful World; especially Deliverance from Sin is implied therein. Be∣lievers are delivered from Sin they are delivered from the <HI>Dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nion</HI> of Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this World Rom. 6. 14. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> not have do∣minion over you.</HI> Also from the very being of Sin, when the leave this World, 7. Verse of the Chapter, <HI>He that is dead is freed from Sin.</HI> Believers when Dead they are perfectly freed from all Sin, freed from the Woful Effect and Consequences of Sin. They are also delivered from Death
<PB N="5" REF="002362_0006_0FDB12C3DFFE6E00"/>
especially from the Second Death, delivered from the Death of the Body and of the Soul too. That is implied in the Salvation of the Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>IT implies positive Good, all posi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Good.</HI> Spiritual Blessings in Hea∣venly Places; all that Good that is contained in the Covenant of Grace, Justification, Sanctification, Adoption, Eternal Life in Heaven, all this is implied <HI>in this One World Salvation.</HI> But then, <HI>How does it appear that Believers on Christ shall have this Salvation</HI> that has been thus described.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is evident, because they belong to the Election of God.</HI> I The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1.4. <HI>Knowing brethren, your Election of God.</HI> Some know it, more might know it, if the fault were not their own. They are not so diligent in the use of means as they should be, therefore did the Apostle exhort, 2 Pet. 1. 10. <HI>Give
<PB N="6" REF="002362_0007_0FDB326D12DF8718"/>
all diligence to make your Calling and Election sure;.</HI> And it is said concerning the Gentiles, Acts 13. 48. <HI>As many as were ordained unto Eternal Life believed.</HI> All that are Ordained unto Eternal Life either do, or shall become Belie∣lievers in Jesus Christ. Election is that which shall not be disap∣pointed. Men may purpose and not perform, but what God has purposed He will surely perform. The Apostle mentions some that had made a Profession of Religion and afterwards fallen away, of whom were <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Phile∣tus, nevertheless</HI> (says he) <HI>the foundation of God stands sure.</HI> The Election of God that stands sure God will see to the Performance of what, He has determined to do. It is foretold false Prophets shall arise and deceive Men, if it <HI>were possible the very Elect themselves,</HI> that implies, It is not possible
<PB N="7" REF="002362_0007_0FDB326D12DF8718"/>
that the Elect of God should be deceived, that any one Soul God has set down in His Book of Election should miscarry. There∣fore Believers in Christ shall not fail of Eternal Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>TRUE Believers are such as Obey the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</HI> They yield Obedience to the great Commandment of Christ. Heb. 5. 9. <HI>He is the Author of E∣ternal Salvation to all that Obey him.</HI> Eternal Salvation follows upon Obedience unto the great Commandment of Christ. Now the great Commandment of Christ is that Men should Believe. Christ has said, This is His Com∣mandment, that we Believe. This Commandment in a special man∣ner Salvation turns upon. There∣fore it was said to one, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Lord Jesus Christ on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shalt be Saved.</HI> By Faith the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is Purified▪ 1 Pet. 1. 22. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e 
<PB N="8" REF="002362_0008_0FDB326E896D3928"/>
purified your Souls in obeying the Truth.</HI> Where there is Obedi∣ence there is a Purified Soul, and a Purified Soul shall be admitted into Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. TRUE <HI>Believers, they are Sanctified,</HI> therefore shall be Saved. It is said, <HI>They shall have an Inhe∣ritance among them that are Sancti∣fied.</HI> All that are Sanctified shall have an Inheritance in Heaven given to them. Thus it is with Believers, they are Sanctified, when God works Faith in any Man, that Faith does not come alone, but there are other Graces of the Spirit of GOD that come along with it, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 5, 6. All the Graces of the Spirit of God are in the Soul of the Believer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is come down into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Believer in respect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> Grace wrought there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Soul shall go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> when he dies.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="9" REF="002362_0008_0FDB326E896D3928"/>4. <HI>WHERE there is Faith there is Repentance for Sin.</HI> Faith and Repentance always go together, Acts 20. 21. <HI>Testifying Repentance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Where there is true Faith in Christ there is Repen∣tance toward God. Now Repen∣tance is said to be <HI>unto Salvation,</HI> if it be true Repentance. There∣fore it is said concerning the Gentiles, Acts 11. 18. That God had given to them <HI>Repentance unto Life.</HI> Where there is true Repentance, Eternal Life will certainly follow. There are two things implied in true Repen∣tance. One is that of Forsaking Sin, Prov. 28. 13. <HI>Whoso Confesseth and Forsaketh shall find Mercy.</HI> He that Confesses Sin ever so much but Forsakes not Sin shall find no Mercy, but whoso Confesses and Forsakes shall be Forgiven. Ezek.11 30. <HI>Repent and turn from

all your Transgressions, so Iniquity shall not be your Ruin.</HI> The othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thing implied in true Repentanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, a turning to God, Isai. 55. 7▪ <HI>Turn to the Lord and He will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bundantly pardon.</HI> So Repentance includes in it a For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking of Sin▪ a turning unto God, a becoming His Servants, living to His Glory▪</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>AS for true Believers thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sins are all forgiven to them therefore they shall go to Hea∣ven when they die and leave thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> God for Christ's sak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has Forgiven them, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 4. 32▪ <HI>God for Christ's sake hath Forgive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you.</HI> God has so Forgiven all Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to them, that their Sins shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as though they had never bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> committed, Jer. 50. 20. <HI>In th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> days, and in that time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith the Lord, the Iniqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none and the Sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will Par∣don 
<PB N="11" REF="002362_0009_0FDB327052EEDCE0"/>
them whom I reserve.</HI> Their Sins shall be as though they had not been. God deals with the Believer as to his Eternal State, as though he had never been Guilty of any one Sin, therefore he shall have the Inheritance of Hea∣ven given to him. It is only Sin that keeps out of Heaven. As for Believers their Sins are as if they had never been, therefore they are said to be <HI>blotted out;</HI> a Debt blotted out is as though it had never been.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>BELIEVERS are the Righteous.</HI> It is said, <HI>The Righte∣ous shall go into Life Eternal,</HI> Mat. 25. 46. Believers in Jesus Christ are those Righteous Ones. They become Righteous through the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them. It was a notable Speech of one of the Martyrs, <HI>Here is a Wonderful Exchange, Christ has my Sins and I have His Righteousness.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002362_0010_0FDB3271859EFED0"/>
The Scripture speaks after the same manner, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <HI>Christ was made Sin that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI> How was Christ made to be Sin? Only by Imputation; He had no Sin of His own but the Sins of Believers were Imputed to Him. How are we made Righteous but by having His Righteousness Im∣puted to us? It is a great Scrip∣ture Truth, Christ becomes <HI>the Surety of Believers,</HI> He has under∣taken for their Cause, to Answer For their Sins, to bring in a Righ∣teousness that shall be sufficient to Save them. These things are evident proofs of the Doctrine before us.</P>

the Blood of Christ can Redeem the Soul, the which is of Un∣speakable Worth and Value.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>CONSIDER, if a Man shall Lose his Soul he is Undone forever.</HI> He is Hopeless, Helpless, and Friendless too. If he lose his Soul he won't have One Friend in Hea∣ven nor Earth that will stand by him; Sinners who were his Com∣panions in Sin, will upbraid him when in Hell, they will say Curs∣ed be thou who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t drawn me into Sin. I remember a Story concerning One of the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who thought that One who had been his familiar and special Friend, appeared to him with those Words, <HI>Wo worth the Day that ever I knew thee, for to please thee, I have Sinned against my Conscience, for which I am now Condemned to the Fire of Hell.</HI> The King was amazed and sent im∣mediately to know how that Man
<PB N="23" REF="002362_0015_0FDB327FC7B2CF58"/>
did, and answer was returned that he was just Dead. So that Sinners will have no Friends, they will be Hopeless and Friendless.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>CONSIDER, if we or any One here Lose our Soul, we shall be found Guilty of Destroying our own Souls.</HI> For God in His Gos∣pel does offer Eternal Life to us, there is not One Man here this Day, but I declare from God un∣to him he may be Saved if he will; if he come to Christ he may be Saved, so does the Scrip∣ture speaks, Rev. 22. 17. <HI>Come whosoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> Whosoever will if he come Repenting and Believ∣ing in Jesus Christ, he shall have Eternal Life given to him.

<P>SOLOMON in these Words speaks of the Excellency of Spiritual Wisdom, he compares it to things most Desireable to Men; and gives the

<P>I shall mention some things that are <HI>Demonstrations</HI> of the Truth before us.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="002362_0019_0FDB328897452740"/>First, <HI>WE may argue by way of Comparison.</HI> All other things that are Desireable are not to be C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣pared with this Wisdom.

When a Man is Rich in Faith Rich in good Works; when he does much Good in his Genera∣tion, and is Glorifying God con∣tinually, then he is Rich indeed Worldly Riches are not to be compared unto Grace in the Soul Who does God give the great Things of this World to? He gives them to the <HI>Nimrods, Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nacharibs, Nebuchadnezzars</HI> of this World, to the worst of Men, Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 4. 17. <HI>God setteth over Kingdom
<PB N="31" REF="002362_0019_0FDB328897452740"/>
the basest of Men.</HI> God gives these Things, even a great portion of them to His Enemies, but Grace in the Soul He gives to none but His Friends, to those that are His Children. It was a <HI>Luther</HI> saying, of that vast Do∣minion God has given to the Great Turk, that it was, <HI>A Bone which God did throw down from His Table for that great Dog the Turk to run away with.</HI> Health is Preferable to Wealth, many that have had great Riches when they have been in racking Pain, would have gi∣ven all their Estate to enjoy the poor Man's Health.

<PB N="32" REF="002362_0020_0FDB328B08893610"/>
of Soul? Psal. 138. 3. <HI>Thou hast strengthened me with strength in my Soul. Paul</HI> Prayed for those he wrote to, that <HI>they might be str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng∣thened with might in the inward man.</HI> Thus if we compare Spiri∣tual Wisdom to the things of this World, they are not compa∣rable to it; the great Things of this World are not comparable to it.</P>
<P>AGAIN, If we Compare it with Spiritual Gifts and Attainments, though they are Desireabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are not to be compared with Grace in the Soul. So says <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 31. <HI>Yet shew I un∣to you a more excellent way.</HI> A more excellent way then that of Gifts, Learning, Attainments which are very Desireable, yet a Man may have them and for all that Perish. <HI>If I speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>and have not Charity

what am I but sounding Brass and tinkling Cymbal.</HI> If I have not Grace in my Soul notwithstand∣ing these Gifts and Attainments I am nothing. A Man may have excellent Gifts, yet be but an In∣strument of Satan. <HI>Austin</HI> said to a Young Man, of great Gifts, the Devil longs to have those Parts of thine to serve his Interest. A Man of excellent Gifts yet not Serving and Glorifying God with them, may Perish to Eternity. <HI>Saul</HI> was among the Prophets, and he that was among the Prophets is now among the Damned in Hell. <HI>Judas</HI> was adorned with admirable Gifts, yet was a Son of Perdition and Cast away fore∣ver. This Demonstration proves the Doctrine before us, That Grace is most Desireable.</P>
<P N="2">2. Demon. <HI>AS for Grace the Excellency of it does appear from the Perpetuity of it.</HI> As for other
<PB N="34" REF="002362_0021_0FDB328C98220638"/>
Things they are not Lasting, much less Everlasting. But Grace is so, 1 Cor. 7. 31. <HI>The fashion of this World passes away.</HI> They don't endure forever, but Grace in the Soul that endures forever. <HI>They shall fear me forever,</HI> says the Lord. If a Man hath True Grace it will Last forever. They that have the Grace of Faith it shall abide with them as long as they Live in this World. The good Things of this World may de∣part from a Man; A Man may be a very Rich Man to Day, yet be as poor as <HI>Job</HI> to morrow, <HI>Grace lasts not only for Time, but for Eternity.</HI> These Outward things Death comes and puts an end to them all. Psal. 49. 17. <HI>He shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carry nothing away with him.</HI> But if a Man has Grace in his Soul, he will carry that away with him, that will continue with him till he comes to Heaven,
<PB N="35" REF="002362_0021_0FDB328C98220638"/>
and will be in a greater Perfecti∣on in Heaven than ever it was here in this World. Thence <HI>Grace</HI> is compared to <HI>Living Waters,</HI> to a Living Spring that never runs dry. Hence Christ said to the Woman of <HI>Sameria, The Water that I shall give, shall be Living Waters, springing up into Everlast∣ing Life.</HI> Grace is compared unto a River, John 7. 38. <HI>He that Be∣lieveth in me, out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Waters.</HI> Ri∣vers continue from One Age to another. Thus it is when True Grace is wrought in the Soul, it continues forever; therefore the excellency of Grace appears to be above the things of this World from the Continuance of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Demon. <HI>IF a Man has Grace in his Soul, he shall have of the Things of this World, such a portion as Infinite Wisdom shall see best for him.</HI> It may be the Wisdom of
<PB N="36" REF="002362_0022_0FDB328E09DB3950"/>
God does not see Good for some of His Servants to have much of this World, therefore denies it to them, Jam. 2. 5. <HI>The poor of this World, rich in Faith.</HI> Christ said to the Angel of the Church in <HI>Smyrna, I know thy poverty, but thou are rich.</HI> Rich in Grace, tho' poor in this World. When God sees his Servants would receive Damage by having much of this World, in Love and Faithfulness He denies it to them; but He gives them that which is much better. 1 Tim. 4. 8. <HI>Godliness has the pro∣mise of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</HI> God∣liness has a Promise of Blessings that respect this present Life, so far as Infinite Wisdom shall see good for them. Psal. 84. 11. <HI>No good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly.</HI> Is so he such a Thing is a good Thing in it self and good for such a Man,
<PB N="37" REF="002362_0022_0FDB328E09DB3950"/>
he shan't want it. Psal. 34. 9. <HI>O fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.</HI> They may be without this and the other good Thing, but they shan't want it. God will give them such a portion of the good Things of this Life as in His Infinite Wisdom He sees best for them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Demon. <HI>A further Evidence of the Truth, is, in that Grace in the Soul is a wonderful Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serva∣tive.</HI> It preserves from the worst and greatest of Evils, it preserves Men from Sin and from Satan too, that he shan't have his Will over them. 1. John. 5. 18. <HI>He that is born of God sinneth not, he cannot Sin because he is born of God.</HI> He cannot Sin as others do, he cannot Sin without Repentance for it. He cannot Sin with his whole Heart and Soul as Ungod∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Men do, and <HI>he that is born of
<PB N="38" REF="002362_0023_0FDB32929FF61548"/>
God keepeth himself, and the wicked One toucheth him not.</HI> The Devil shan't come at him, shan't ruine him. Grace in the Soul pre'erves from the power of Satan and from Sin: We see notable instances of this in the Scriptures, as now, there was that instance of <HI>Joseph</HI> that was tempted by his leud Mistress; he had the Fear of God in his Heart, that kept him from being overcome by that Tempta∣tion. Says he, <HI>How shall I do this Wickedness and Sin against God.</HI> He cannot do it. Thus it was with <HI>David</HI> divers times, said he, Psal. 18. 23. <HI>I kept my self from mine iniquity.</HI> It was from the Grace in <HI>David's</HI> Heart that he was kept from that Iniquity, which he was in special danger by; there was that Iniquity of Killing <HI>Saul,</HI> he had opportunity to have done it, and was urged by other Men to do it, so he might have delivered
<PB N="39" REF="002362_0023_0FDB32929FF61548"/>
himself from the Hand of his E∣nemy, but he did it not, he kept himself from that Iniquity, he knew that God would be Disho∣noured if he did that thing. So when in his Passion purposed to have Destroyed the House of <HI>Nabal</HI> and all his Family; when <HI>Abigail</HI> came to him and gave him good Advice, said he, Blessed be thou and Blessed be thy Advice, thou hast kept me from shedding of Blood: In my Passion I resol∣ved to be revenged on such an un∣grateful Wretch, but now I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltered my Mind. Thus Grace keeps Men from Sin. If Men live in Places where there is much danger of their Sinning, if they have Grace in their Souls they will be Preserved notwith∣standing. It is said of <HI>Obadiah, He feared the Lord greatly,</HI> 1 Kin. 18. 3. Therefore he did not do as <HI>Ahab's</HI> Courtiers did, when ma∣ny
<PB N="40" REF="002362_0024_0FDB32940BB85DC0"/>
Prophets were cut off. This Man that Feared the Lord, did take Care of the Prophets of the Lord. Thus <HI>Daniel,</HI> when in the Court of a King that was a great Idolater, he did not fall in with that Idolatry, he was bold as a Lion, he would rather be throw among the Lions than be Guilt of such Idolatry. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> brought up in the Court of <HI>Persia,</HI> he was not as other Courtiers, <HI>so did not I,</HI> says he, <HI>because of the Fear of God.</HI> Be sure there are two Sins that if a Man hath Grace in his Soul he shall be kept pure from he shall never become Guilty of. One is the Sin against the Holy Ghost. Psa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 19. 13. <HI>I shall be in∣nocent from the great Transgression.</HI> The Sin against the Holy Ghost is the great Transgression, but the Gracious Soul shall be kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from it. The other Sin that the that have Grace in their Soul
<PB N="41" REF="002362_0024_0FDB32940BB85DC0"/>
shall never become Guilty of, is the Sin of <HI>Final Impenitence.</HI> It is true a good Man may fall into very grievous Sins in an Hour of Temptation: As we see in <HI>Peter,</HI> a very good Man, yet in an Hour Temptation he fell grievously, but he did not persist in his fall but did immediately repent, <HI>he went out and wept bitterly. David</HI> Sinned grievously in that matter of <HI>Uriah,</HI> the Hittite, but he Re∣pented of it and published his Repentance before the whole World, Psalm Fifty-first is the Psalm of <HI>Davids</HI> Repentance on the account of that grievous Sin. So <HI>Solomon</HI> was Guilty of great Backsliding from God, but he Re∣pented of it: The Book of <HI>Eccle∣siastes</HI> is the Book of <HI>Solomon's</HI> Re∣pentance. They that have Grace in their Souls may fall grievously but not utterly, he shall arise a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain.

of Jesus Christ. They that are Servants of a great Man are counted happy, on that account, as the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> said to <HI>Solomon, Happy are these thy Ser∣vants that wait upon thee.</HI> But to be a Servant of Jesus Christ is a greater Happiness than to be a Servant of <HI>Solomon.</HI> The great∣est Happiness in the World is to be a Servant of Jesus Christ. <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperor was wont to stile himself, <HI>a Vassal of Jesus Christ.</HI> This is an Honour belong∣ing to all Believers. But what is it then to be employed in any Peculiar Service for Christ, to Preach Christ to the Souls of Men, how great is that Honour.

<P>USE II. <HI>TO Preach CHRIST is certainly the Duty of His Ministers.</HI> They cannot Preach Christ too much. <HI>Paul</HI> when he was at <HI>Rome,</HI> he taught the Things that did concern Jesus Christ.

upon you, Make sure of True Faith in Christ, that will make the Day of Christ to be a Joyful day to you indeed: But the difficulty is for a Man to know whether his Faith be True or no. To make sure of that consider, That Life or Death de∣pends upon this one thing, that your Faith be True. For indeed the greatest part of Men that call them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lves Christians are deceived, they think they have Faith when they have not. I am perswaded there is scarce a Man in this Assembly, that should I come to you one by one, &amp; ask, do you Believe in Jesus Christ? he will say, yes; do you think I am a Turk, or a Jew. But is your Faith a True Faith, does your Faith work by Love. If a Man has True Faith he Loves Christ more than any Crea∣ture in this World, yea, more than his own Life. A Man that has True Faith will readily part with his Life at the Command of the Lord

Jesus Christ. Christ has said, and wont you believe His Word. <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.26. If he do not hate his Life in comparison; that if Christ should call him to part with his Life he will readily do it, Faith that thus works by Love, is True Faith, there∣fore make sure of that. One thing more, for Consolation to Believers, They shall not tarry till the Day of Judgment to behold the Glory of Christ, but shall presently upon their Death be with Christ to be∣hold His Glory. <HI>Being absent from the Body, they are present with the Lord.</HI> The Soul of the True Believer is no sooner absent from the Body, but Holy Angels carry him into the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, into Unspeakable Glory &amp; Happi∣ness, this is what Christ has prayed for on their behalf, Joh. 17. 24. <HI>Fa∣ther, I will that they whom thou hast gi∣ven me, be with me where I am to behold my Glory. Amen,</HI> Dear Lord, <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
