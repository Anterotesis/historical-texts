<HEAD>CHAP. I. The MANUAL EXERCISE of a Foot-Company, or Battalion: With an Explanation.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER exercises a Battalion, or any Number of Men, should place him∣self opposite to the Centre, at such a Dis∣tance that he may take in the whole at one View. And as the performing the Exercise well, depends a great deal on giving the Words of Command, those who exercise should deliver the Words <HI>clear and distinct.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever wou'd attain to any Perfection in it, must study the Compass of his Voice, that he may not over∣strain

it, left it cause an immediate Hoarseness: and should lay the Emphasis in the right Place, and make proper Stops or Pauses, when the Command is too long to be pronounced at one Breath; which when judici∣ously done, is of great Service to the Men, in giving them Time to think on the Word of Command before it is fully delivered, and consequently preparing them to perform it with Life, Vigour, and Exactness.</P>
<P>I shall only now before I proceed to the manual Exercise of the Foot, give one or two Directions for the Position of a Soldier under Arms.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>A Soldier having his Firelock shoulder'd, must stand with a strait Body, holding up his Head without moving, and always looking towards the Commanding Officer, or he who exercises the Battalion; nor must he use any Motion but what the Word of Command, when given, directs.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>His Feet are to be at one Step Distance, the Heels in a strait Line, and the Toes turn'd outward.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>The Firelock must lie on the left Shoulder, and the left Hand on the Butt-End, the Thumb being placed in the Hollow thereof, pressing the Guard hard against the Breast, that the Muzzel may be mounted; the Lock must be turned a little outward, 'till the under Part of the Butt-End is brought opposite to the Middle of the Body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>The left Elbow must be turned a little outward from the Body, but without any Constraint to the Arm; and the right Arm must hang in an easy Posture down the right Side, with the Palm of the Hand turn'd to the Thigh.</P>
<P>The Company being drawn out, and the Files opened, as directed in the IIId Chapter.</P>

<P><HI>N.

thro' them; but as the doubling the Files in that Manner in Time of Action, would take up too much Time, they have fallen upon a quicker and more safe Way of doing it, by wheeling back two or three Plattoons, or as many as are requisite, and as soon as the Troops are passed, the Plattoons are immediately wheeled up again; for which Reason the doubling the half Ranks of the whole Battalion hath been disused. But as the half Ranks of every Division doubling their Files, is of singular Use in the marching of any Number of Troops for the passing of Defiles, Bridges, or Passes, not broad enough to contain the Front of a Division entire, they are then to march off by half Ranks, as is above shewn, by the doubling; and as soon as they are passed they are to move up again, for which Reason they have been continued in the Evolutions now practised.</P>

<P>Before we proceed to the following Words of Command, which are for the Wheeling, it will be proper to lay down general Rules for the performing them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>General Rules for Wheeling.</HEAD>
<P>The Circle is divided into four equal Parts: Wheeling to the Right or Left, is only a Quarter of the Circle.</P>
<P>Wheeling to the Right or Left about, is one Half of the Circle.</P>
<P>When you wheel to the Right, you are to close to the Right so near as to touch the right-hand Man, and to look to the Left (without turning the Head) in order to bring the Rank about even.</P>
<P>When you wheel to the Left, you are to close to the Left, and look to the Right as above directed.</P>
<P>This Rule will serve for all Wheelings by Ranks; as when a Battalion is marching by Sub-divisions, with their Ranks open, then each Rank wheels distinctly by it self, when it comes to the Ground on which the Rank before it wheeled, but not before.</P>
<P>In wheeling, the Men are to take particular Care neither to open nor close their Ranks, and to carry their Firelocks high and firm on their Shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005344_0021_10171DBCA6F39690"/>
In wheeling, the Motion of each Man is quicker or slower according to the Distance he is from the Right or Left, the Circle that every Man wheels being larger accor∣ding to the Distance he is from the Hand he wheels to.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="31" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>XXXI. To the Right, wheel by Divisions.—March.</HEAD>
<P>At this Command they all step forward with their left Feet, and wheel to the Right a Quarter of the Circle.</P>
<P>The right-hand Man of the front Rank of every Division must turn on his right Heel, without taking it out of its Place, and bring his Body and left Foot about with the Rank, according as it moves quicker or slower.</P>
<P>All the Men in the front Rank are to keep their Bodies in a direct Line with the left-hand Man of their Division.</P>
<P>All Wheelings are to be done slow; and even those Men on the extream Parts of the Ranks, are not to exceed a mo∣derate Pace.</P>
<P>The Officers are to wheel on the Head of their several Divisions, and the Serjeants on the Flanks and in the Rear.</P>
<P>As soon as the Divisions have wheeled a Quarter of the Circle, the Major is to proceed to the next Word of Com∣mand.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Directions for forming a Batta∣lion, posting of Officers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Article I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Companies are come to the Place where they are to form into Battalion, they draw up according to Seniority, thus; The Colonel's Company, or eldest, on the Right; the Lieut. Colonel's, or second, on the Left; the Major's, or third Company, on the left of the Colonel's; the fourth on the right of the Lieut. Colonel's; and so on from Right to Left, 'till the youngest comes in the Centre. As the Companies draw up, the Subal∣terns are to move up to the Front, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Method of Of∣ficers posting in Companies.</HI></NOTE> the Lieutenants placing themselves on the right of the Captains, and the Ensigns on the Left, towards the Flanks of the Com∣panies. The Serjeants are to form themselves in the rear of the rear Ranks; and the Drummers are to march about thirty Paces in the Front, where the Drum-major is to form them into a Rank entire, opposite to the Centre and facing the Battalion, in which Position they are to remain 'till the Major orders the Officers to their Posts.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="005344_0028_10171E06A2141F00"/>
Let it be a standing Rule for the Companies to leave an Interval of a good Space between them, when they draw up in Battalion, and march in with their Files compleat; and if they have any odd Men, let 'em fall in the Rear of the rear Rank, where the Adjutant or Serjeant-major should join them together, form them into Files, and draw 'em up in the Intervals between the Companies. As the Companies draw up, the Captains should immediately face their Men, and order them to cover their File-leaders, and see that they do it: after which they are to face to their proper Front.</P>
<P>The Intervals which remain between the Companies after the odd Men are form'd, must be closed by facing the Companies to the Right and Left inwards, or by ordering the flank Men of those Companies, where the Intervals happen to divide the Ground between them; which is the shortest Way.</P>
<P>If there be any Grenadiers, they must draw up to the Right of the Colonel's Company, and have an Interval between them equal to the Front of the Company, that when the Files are opened they may join the Battalion.</P>
<P>When the Battalion draws up six deep, the Grenadiers are to do the same, but if the Battalion, on Account of its Weakness, draws up but four deep, the Grenadiers draw up but three deep.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Article II.</HEAD>
<P>SO soon as the Men are formed and the Intervals clo∣sed, the Major orders the <HI>Officers to take their Posts in Battalion;</HI> which is done by Seni∣ority of Commission, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Method of Offi∣cers posting in Battalion.</HI></NOTE> thus; The el∣dest Captain is to place himself on the Right of the Battalion; the second Captain on the Left; the third on the 
<PB N="30" REF="005344_0029_10171DCDCEA81340"/>
Left of the eldest; the fourth on the Right of the second; and so on, 'till the youngest Ensign comes to the Centre.</P>
<P>The Captains and Subalterns are to dress in the same Line, about two good Paces before the front Rank, and to divide the Ground equally between them, so as to cover the Front of the Battalion.</P>
<P>There must be a Serjeant placed on the right and left Flank of each Rank, to dress them: The rest of the Ser∣jeants are to range themselves in the Rear of the Battalion, about four Paces from the rear Rank. If there are not Serjeants enough, then there must be but three placed on the right Wing, and three on the left, in this Order. On the Right, a Serjeant to the 1<HI>st,</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> and 5<HI>th</HI> Ranks; and on the Left, a Serjeant to the 2<HI>d,</HI> 4<HI>th,</HI> and 6<HI>th</HI> Ranks.</P>
<P>The Drummers are to divide into three Divisions; the Drum-major with the First, are to post themselves on the Right of the Colonel's Company; the second Division on the Left of the Lieutenant Colonel's Company, and both to dress in a Line with the front Rank of Men; the third Di∣vision of Drums, with the Hautboys, are to post themselves in the Rear of the Ensigns in the Centre.</P>
<P>When the Battalion is drawn up, the Colonel's Post is in the Centre, about four Paces before the Ensigns with the Colours. The Lieutenant Colonel's Post is a little to the left of the Colonel's, about three Paces from the Rank of Officers.</P>
<P>When there is no General or superior Officer present to see the Exercise performed, the Colonel does not take his Post at the Head of the Battalion, but remains in the Front, without taking his half Pike in his Hand, to give the Major necessary Orders about the Exercise; in this Case the Lieu∣tenant Colonel is to post himself at the Head of the Batta∣lion, with his half Pike in his Hand: But if the Colonel is absent, he then remains in the Front in the same Manner as before mentioned for the Colonel, the sole Command then devolving on the Lieutenant Colonel.</P>

When ever the Regiment is drawn out, no Officer must be absent without Leave, but each stand at the Post assigned him, with his Arms in his Hand, expecting such Orders as he may receive, either to exercise the whole Battalion, a Part of it, or a single Company, as the commanding Officer shall direct; which he is always to perform with his half Pike or Partisan in his Hand.</P>

<HEAD>Article III.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the Divisions are told off, the Major is to proceed to the opening of Files, by the following Words of Command:</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="command">
<HEAD>To the Left, open your Files.</HEAD>
<P>At this both Officers and Soldiers face nimbly to the Left on their right Heels, excepting the File on the Right of the Battalion, and the eldest Captain, who must stand still.</P>
<P>The Serjeants on the right Flank of the Battalion, and the first Division of Drummers, face at the same Time to the Right on their left Heels, in which Position the Whole are to remain 'till the next Word of Command. But be∣fore we proceed to that, it is necessary to give Directions for the proper Distances of Ranks and Files, according to the several Occasions, which are as follow, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>In drawing up a Battalion for Exercise or Review, the Ranks are to be at four ordinary Paces Distance from one another.</P>
<P>When they are to fire, either by Ranks, Plattoons, the whole Battalion, or in the Square, the Ranks are to be moved up to half Distance, or two Paces.</P>
<P>In all Wheelings, either by Division, or the whole Bat∣talion, the Ranks are to be closed forward to close Order, which is one Pace Distance.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005344_0031_10171DD135F52BE0"/>
The Files are to be opened to the Distance of one Pace, or the Length of an out-stretch'd Arm; that is, When the Men are faced to their proper Front, order the front Rank to stretch out their right Arms to the Right, and if they can touch the left Shoulder of their right-hand Men, they have their proper Distance; and then let the Men of the rear Ranks dress with their File-Leaders, or those in the Front.</P>
<P>When they are to fire, the Files are to be at half a Pace Distance; that is, such a Distance that when the Arm is set bent against the Side, the Elbow is to touch the right-hand Man.</P>
<P>In marching or wheeling, the Files must be so close as that the Men may almost touch one another with their Shoulders. These Things being known, I proceed to the second Word of Command in opening the Files, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="command">
<HEAD>March.</HEAD>
<P>As soon as this Word is given, the Division of Drummers on the Left lift up their right Feet together, and march very slow (without opening their Distance from one ano∣ther) in a direct Line to the Left: The Serjeants on the left Flank carrying their Halberts with both Hands before them, the Spear upwards, move at the same Time to the Left, beginning also with the right Feet; and as soon as they have open'd to a Pace Distance from the left-hand File, that File is then to move, and so on, one File after another, 'till the Whole are opened to their proper Distance, as is already directed.</P>
<P>In opening the Files, each File must move at once, all the Men in it beginning with the same Feet, and taking them up and setting them down together; for this End, the Men in the front Rank, who are called File-Leaders, must not begin to move 'till those before them are at a proper Dis∣tance; 
<PB N="33" REF="005344_0032_10171DD4FB5112E8"/>
the other five Ranks being to observe their Motions: In order the better to effect which, observe the following,</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Rules for the opening the Files, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>In the opening and closing the Files, or marching all to∣gether to the Right or Left to change their Ground, they should begin with the Feet next the Front. When they face to the Right it must be done on the left Heels, and so <HI>vice versa.</HI> And as soon as the Men of the first File on the Left of the Battalion lift up their right Feet a second Time, the Men of the second File are to lift up their right Feet; and when those of the second File lift up their right Feet a second Time, the Men of the third File are to begin with their right Feet; and so the rest of the Files are to follow the same Directions 'till the Whole have opened.</P>
<P>In doing this they are to take but short Steps, and to move on very slow, but with an equal Pace, all lifting up and setting down their right Feet together, and doing the same with their Left. And this being constantly observed will bring the Men to walk with a bolder Air, giving them a freer Use of their Limbs, and a Notion of Time; by which Means they will perform their Exercise with the greater Exactness.</P>
<P>The Men of the five rear Ranks must keep in a strait Line with their File leaders, <HI>and neither close nor open their Ranks</HI> in marching; but carry their Arms high and firm on their Shoulders, looking up and keeping their Bodies strait.</P>
<P>The Officers are to carry their half Pikes or Partisans downwards, and the Ensigns to advance the Colours.</P>
<P>No Officer is to move 'till the File opposite to him does; and when the Men of that File step forward with their right Feet, he is to do the same with his, keeping an equal Pace, and in a direct Line with them.</P>
<P>The Serjeants in the Rear must observe the same Rule; only they must carry their Halberts as is directed for those on the Flank.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005344_0033_10171DD806EF6018"/>
As soon as the second File on the Right of the Battalion, which is the last to open, steps forward, the Major then proceeds to the next Word of Command.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="command">
<HEAD>Halt.</HEAD>
<P>On giving this Word of Command the Officers and Men are to face briskly to the Right on their right Heels, those Feet being then foremost, if the foregoing Rules are observed. But least they should not, a Stroke of a Drum should be given when they are to stand, that they may have Time to place their right Feet in a Line with the Left, or a little before them; and after a Pause of half a Minute, the Major is to give the Word, <HI>Halt.</HI> And as soon as they are faced, the Serjeants must dress the Ranks and Files.</P>
<P>When the Ranks and Files are dressed, the Officers are to take their Posts of Exercise in the Rear of the Battalion; which is done, either by Word of Command, or Signal by the Drum. If by the Drum,</P>
<P>First, a <HI>Preparative</HI> is beat, then a <HI>Flam;</HI> at which the Officers advance their Pikes at two Motions, and at the same Time the Serjeants their Halberts, in the same Manner, and stand so 'till the second <HI>Flam;</HI> at which the Officers face on their left Heel to the Right about, and the Serjeants to the Right and Left outwards from the Centre. Upon the <HI>Troop,</HI> the Officers march slow 'till they are twelve Paces beyond the rear Rank, the Serjeants marching at the same Time, but quicker: Those on the Right and Left of the front Rank march strait out, followed by the others, until they have got eight Paces farther into the Front than where the Major has posted himself, and then face to the Right and Left inward, each marching from thence in a strait Line until their Leaders meet in the Centre, having twelve, six or four on the Flanks, as the Number then in the Field will admit of. The Hautboys and Drums march out to the Front, and post themselves between the Major 
<PB N="35" REF="005344_0034_10171E0D22658EA8"/>
and the Serjeants. At the <HI>third Flam,</HI> the Officers face on their left Heels to the Left about, and the Serjeants in the Front face to the Right and Left inwards. At the <HI>fourth Flam,</HI> the Officers and Serjeants are to order their Arms, and continue in that Posture during the Exercise, or until they are commanded otherwise.</P>
<P>When the Officers are ordered back to their former Posts, a <HI>Preparative</HI> will beat, after that a <HI>Flam;</HI> upon which the Officers advance their Pikes, and the Serjeants their Hal∣berts; the Serjeants in the Front face to the Right and Left outwards from the Centre, and those on the Flanks to the Right and Left about. Upon the <HI>Troop,</HI> the Officers march slow to the Front; the Serjeants, Hautboys and Drums quick to their former Posts, and then face to their proper Front. On the <HI>second Flam</HI> the Officers and Serjeants order their Arms, except the Grenadier Officers, who are to rest their Fusees on their left Arms.</P>
<P>If by Word of Command; in Place of the <HI>Preparative,</HI> OFFICERS TAKE CARE: For the <HI>first Flam,</HI> ADVANCE YOUR ARMS: For the <HI>second Flam,</HI> TO THE RIGHT ABOUT: For the <HI>Troop,</HI> MARCH: For the <HI>third Flam,</HI> HALT: For the <HI>fourth Flam,</HI> ORDER YOUR ARMS.</P>
<P>In ordering them back to their Posts; in Place of a <HI>Preparative</HI> OFFICERS TAKE CARE: For the <HI>first Flam,</HI> ADVANCE YOUR ARMS: For the <HI>Troop,</HI> MARCH: For the <HI>second Flam,</HI> HALT.</P>
<P>The Officers are to perform every Part of the foregoing Ceremonies together, both in advancing their half Pikes and ordering them, facing, marching, and halting; for the doing of which, they are to take every Motion from the Officer on the Right.</P>

<P>AS soon as the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are returned to their Posts, the Files are to be closed, by the following Words of Command:</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>I. To the Right, close your Files.</HEAD>
<P>The eldest Captain, and the right Hand File of the Battalion, stand as before directed in opening; all the rest face at once to the Right on their left Heels. As soon as they are faced, the Ensigns advance the Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberts: And then the Major proceeds:</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>II. March.</HEAD>
<P>At this Command they all lift up the Feet they faced on, and march slow 'till the Files are closed to their former Distance, that is of half a Pace.</P>
<P>The Officers march with their Arms downwards, the Ensigns with their Colours, and the Serjeants with their Halberts advanced; and all observe the same Rules in closing as in opening, and the Men are to observe to lift up and set down the same Feet together; and when they are closed to their proper Distance they are to stand, placing the Feet they faced on a little before the other: Alter which the Major gives the following Word of Command.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="command">
<HEAD>III. Halt.</HEAD>
<P>At this Word, all face to their proper Front, on the same Feet they just before faced on, and immediately straiten their Ranks and Files.</P>
<P>If the Battalion is to be dismiss'd as soon as the Files are closed, the Colours are to be lodged by a Detachment from 
<PB N="37" REF="005344_0036_10171E1070F2DA70"/>
the Companies to which they belong, headed by the Lieu∣tenant and the Ensigns, carrying the Colours advanced and flying; and as soon as they are arrived at the Place they are to be lodged in, the Detachment is to be drawn up, and the Colours to be furl'd and lodg'd, and then he is to order the Detachment to rest their Firelocks, then Club, and dismiss them with the Ruff of the Drum.</P>
<P>After the Colours are lodg'd, the Major orders the Offi∣cers, Serjeants, and Drummers to their Companies, and then orders the Whole to Club, by these Words,</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="commands">
<HEAD>I. Rest your Firelocks. II. Club your Firelocks.</HEAD>
<P>And as soon as these Motions are perform'd, the Com∣panies may be order'd to march off from the Right or Left, to their Barracks, or Place where they are to be dismiss'd.</P>
<P>When ever the Men march with club'd Arms, the Offi∣cers are to advance their half Pikes, and the Serjeants their Halberts; the Captain and Ensign are to march in the Front (the Ensign a little behind the Captain) and the Lieute∣nant in the Rear of the Company or Detachment, the Drum∣mers are to march between the Ensign and the front Rank, beating the Troop.</P>
<P>When the Regiment draws out, the Major and Adjutant should be always on Horseback, it being impossible for them to perform their Duty on Foot, in the Manner it ought to be done: They are to exercise the Regiment on Horseback, but no other Officer is to do it mounted, unless such, who in their Absence are appointed to their Duty.</P>
<P>When the commanding Officer orders any of the other Officers to exercise the Battalion, or a Part of it, they are to do it on Foot, with their half Pikes or Partisans in their Hands: And this should be frequently done for the In∣struction of the Officers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Containing Directions for the different Firings of the Foot.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Article I.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as the Exercise is over, and the Offi∣cers returned to the Front, the next Thing which they generally proceed to, is the diffe∣rent Firings; for which End the following Particulars are to be first performed.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Rear half Files are to be doubled to the Left, as in Explanation 5, of the Evolutions.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Grenadiers are to be divided on the Right and Left of the Battalion, in the following Manner, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>The Company of the Grenadiers is to be divided into two Platoons, the Captain and second Lieutenant placing themselves at the Head of that on the Right, and the first Lieutenant on that on the Left. One Serjeant and one Drummer are to remain with the right Platoon, the other two Serjeants and Drummer are to march with the Left.</P>
<P>When the Grenadiers are thus divided, the first Lieu∣tenant, with his Platoon, is to march along the Ranks of the Battalion, 'till the right-hand File of his Platoon has got one Pace beyond the left-hand File of the Battalion, and then Halt, and make them dress with the Battalion.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="005344_0038_10171E13649F55F0"/>
The Front Rank of the Grenadiers marches between the Officers and the front Rank of the Battalion; the centre Rank of Grenadiers, between the front and centre Ranks; and the rear Rank of Grenadiers, between the centre and rear Ranks of the Battalion.</P>
<P>As soon as the left-hand Files of the right Platoon of Gre∣nadiers comes within a Pace of the right-hand File of the Battalion, the Captain is to order them to halt, and make them dress with the others.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Major is to order the Men to fix their Bay∣onetts, it being the Custom to perform the Firings with the Bayonetts fixed; which however may be omitted in com∣mon Exercise; but never in Service.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> When the Bayonetts are fixed, the Battalion is to be divided into Platoons; the Number of which must depend on the Strength of the Battalion, and the particular Firings you intend to perform. Neither is a Platoon com∣posed of any fixed Number of Files; (I mean those of three deep, which are commonly called Half-files, because a File of Men are taken for fix, in the ordinary Way of speaking; whereas, the true Meaning of the Word <HI>File,</HI> signifies all those Men who stand in a direct Line from Front to Rear: So that there being three, four, or six deep, does not alter the Sense, or change it from being a File) but may be more or less, as the Battalion will allow it: However a Platoon is seldom composed of less than ten Files, which are thirty Men, or more than sixteen Files, which are forty eight Men; because a Platoon composed of less than ten Files would not be of Weight enough to do any considerable Execution; and those above Sixteen, wou'd be too great a Body of Men for an Officer to manage upon Service.</P>
<P>In dividing the Battalion into Platoons they should be composed of an equal Number of Files, or at least not above one File stronger than another, and those shou'd be the Flank and Colour Platoons.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="005344_0039_10171DE365327DD0"/>
As soon as the Platoons are told off, there must be an Officer appointed to each to command them; taking an equal Proportion of Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns, for that Purpose.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant Colonel, with the remaining Part of the Officers, are to march and post themselves in the Rear of the Battalion, in the same Manner as they do at Exercise. The Lieutenant Colonel opposite to the Colour Platoon.</P>
<P>The Serjeants should be divided to the several Platoons, and posted in the Rear of them.</P>
<P>The Colonel and the Ensigns with the Colours, remain in their former Posts, at the Head of the Battalion.</P>
<P>The Interval between each Platoon should be but one Pace, and the Officer who commands the Platoon, is to fall into it when they fire.</P>
<P>The Officers in the Rear are to keep the Men up, and see that they do their Duty in Action; and also to lead the Battalion off in Order, when they are commanded to retire.</P>
<P>The Method which is now practised, and which is found to be the most useful, is the dividing the Platoons into several Firings; each Firing being seldom composed of less than four Platoons, or more than five, which Firings are not kept together in one Part of the Battalion, but the Platoons of each firing distributed into different Parts of the Regiment. The Reasons for it are these, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The disposing the Platoons of each Firing into different Parts of the Battalion, will extend your Fire in such a Manner, as to do Execution in different Parts of the opposite Regiment.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> By their being divided in this Manner, should the Enemy and you join before those Platoons have Time to load, not any one Part of your Battalion is very much weakned.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Should the Platoons of each Firing be together, too great a Part of the Battalion would be exposed in one Place before the Men could load, particularly the flank Firings.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005344_0040_10171E18ACDA3168"/>
<HI>Lastly,</HI> The Firings being thus disposed, it makes the Exercise appear more beautiful, and accustoms the Men to hear firing on their Right and Left, without touching their Arms 'till they have Orders for it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Article II.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the better explaining the different Firings, and the Distribution of the Platoons of each Firing, in several Parts of the Regiment, there is hereunto annexed three Plans, the first consisting of eighteen Platoons, composing three firings of five Platoons each, and a Reserve of three Platoons: The second Plan consists of fifteen Platoons, divided into three Firings of five Platoons each; the third is of twelve Platoons, divided into three Firings of four Platoons each.</P>
<P>The two Platoons of Grenadiers are included in the above Number, and always make a Part of the Reserve; but when the Battalion is told off only in three Firings, they are then included in the last firing.</P>
<P>The Platoon marked with the Letter A, in the annexed Plans, are those of the first firings.</P>
<P>Those marked B, of the second firings.</P>
<P>Those marked C, of the third firings.</P>
<P>And those marked D, are of the reserve.</P>
<P>By which Means the different Firings may be seen at one View, and how the Platoons of each firing fall into the several Parts of the Battalion.</P>
<P>The Rule laid down in these Plans may be varied, if the commanding Officer thinks proper otherwise to dispose of the Platoons of the different Firings; because the Circum∣stances of Time and Place, or the Situation of the Enemy may require a different Disposition.</P>

Before we proceed further, it will be necessary to ex∣plain the Platoon Exercise; that is, what Number of Mo∣tions of the Manual Exercise they are to perform at each Word of Command.</P>
<P>There are but three Words of Command used in the Platoon Exercise, which are as follows,</P>
<P>I. <HI>Make ready.</HI> II.<HI> Present.</HI> III. <HI>Fire.</HI></P>
<P>By the first Word of Command the Men are to perform all the Motions contained in the four first Words of Com∣mand of the Manual Exercise. And immediately after the performing the last of the said Motions, which is Cocking, the Men of the front Rank are to kneel down on their right Knees, placing the Butt-End of their Firelocks on the Ground, keeping their Thumbs on the Cocks, and their Fingers on the Trickers. The centre and rear Ranks close forward at the same Time with recover'd Arms; the Men of the centre Rank placing their left Feet on the inside of the right Feet of their File-Leaders, bringing their right Feet to the Right, but not in a Line with the Left, only in the same Position as when they rest. The Men in the rear Ranks place their left Feet on the inside of the right Feet of those in the centre Rank, bringing their right Feet to the Right, as those in the Centre did.</P>
<P>The placing the Feet in this Manner is called in military Terms, <HI>Locking;</HI> by which the Men of the centre Ranks present their Firelocks over the right Shoulders of their File∣Leaders, and those of the rear Ranks present to the Right of the centre-rank Men, which brings their Firelocks, when they present, to the Intervals between the Files.</P>
<P>By the second Word of Command, they are to present their Firelocks, as in Explanation 5 is directed.</P>
<P>By the third Word of Command, they are to Fire, as in Explanation 6: After which they are to recover their Arms, the front Rank rising up, and the centre and rear
<PB N="46" REF="005344_0045_10171E21790D83B8"/>
Ranks falling back to half Distance, it being a standing Rule to move the Ranks up to that Distance before they are ordered to make ready; and as soon as the centre and rear Ranks have fallen back, they are all to proceed to half-cock, prime, load, and shoulder, performing the several Motions together, as directed in the Manual Ex∣ercise, with this Difference, that in the Platoon Exer∣cise, after priming the Men are not to bring their Fire∣locks to a Recover in order to cast about to the Left, but after they have shut their Pans, they are to seize their Fire∣locks with their right Hands behind the Lock, as in Expla∣nation 11, Motion 3; and with both Hands, without moving their Feet from the Ground, or changing their Aspect, bring their Firelocks up before them, and at the same Time they are to quit the Butt with their right Hands, and take hold of the Muzzel when it comes opposite to the right Shoulder, which they are to bring that Way with their left Hands; by which Means the Position of the Firelock will be the same as in Explanation 12, only this Difference, that by the Men being faced to the Right, the Butt will point to the Front, as in the other it does to the Rear.</P>
<P>That this may be done without too much Constraint to the Men, they may change the Position of their Feet, by turning on their Heels when they seize the Muzzel with their right Hands, bringing the right Toe to point to the Rear, and the Left along the Rank, forming a T to the Rear as they did before to the Front.</P>
<P>The Reason for their performing it in this Manner, is both to gain Time and to prevent the Men from being too much fatigued. Great Care ought to be taken in making up the Cartridges to such an Exactness, that after they are placed in the Muzzel, one Thumb with the Butt-End on the Ground, may make them run down to the Breech of the Barrel; but as the ramming down the Cartridges, is, for many Reasons very necessary, it ought by no Means to be disused.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="005344_0046_10171E5562F22EA8"/>
In dividing the Platoons into the several Firings, the Major should take particular Care to let the Officers and Soldiers know distinctly what Firing they belong to, whether of the first, second, or third, or the Reserve, as also what Number each Platoon is of in the different Firings, as the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth Platoon, of the first, second, or third Firing, or of the Reserve.</P>
<P>In order to know if they have rightly understood their telling off, the Major may try the Platoons of each Firing apart, by making these Platoons perform some Motions together, as Resting, and Shouldering: The same may be done by the Platoons of each Firing singly.</P>
<P>He must likewise let them know what Firings they are to perform, and in what Manner they are to do it, whether Standing, Advancing, or Retiring, or all three; as also whether the Platoons of each Firing are to fire in their Order, that is, one after another, or together.</P>
<P>The Signals usually made on these Occasions, is by Beat of Drum.</P>
<P>At the beating of the March, the Regiment is to march strait forward, beginning with the left Feet, and when the Drum ceases they are to halt.</P>
<P>When a Retreat is beat, the Battalion is to face to the Right about (the Men performing it on their left Heels) and march toward the Rear, and when the Drum ceases, they are to face to their proper Front, by coming to the Left about on their left Heels.</P>
<P>At the beating of a Preparative, all the Platoons of that Firing which is to come next, are to make ready together as is explain'd in the Platoon Exercise.</P>
<P>A Flam, or double Stroke, is the Signal for the Platoons to begin to fire: The particular Directions for which, are shewn in the following Article.</P>

<HEAD>Article III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Battalion being prepared according to the foregoing Directions, we now proceed to the Firings, and begin with those in the first PLAN, consisting of 18 Platoons, com∣posing three Firings and a Reserve.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To go thro' the Firings standing.</HEAD>
<P>The Major is to order the Drummers to beat a Prepara∣tive, at which all the Platoons of the first Firing are to make ready, and at the same Time the Officers who command them, are to place themselves in the Right and Left of their Platoons, facing towards the Colours; thus, The Officers to the Right of the Colours to place themselves on the Right of the Platoons, and the Officers to the Left, on the Left of the Platoons, advance a short Pace before the front Rank, to make the Men level well.</P>
<P>Then the Major orders the Drummers to beat a Flam; at which the Officer commanding the first Platoon of that Firing, gives the following Words of Command:</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>Present. Fire.</HEAD>
<P>As soon as the Word Fire is given to the first Platoon, the Officer commanding the second, is to give the Word <HI>Present,</HI> and then <HI>Fire.</HI> The Officer commanding the third Platoon, is to observe the same Rule when the Word <HI>Fire</HI> is given to the second Platoon. The Officers com∣manding the fourth and fifth Platoons of that Firing, are to follow the same Directions.</P>
<P>The Officers who give the Words of Command, are to speak them clear and distinct, and not to proceed to the Word <HI>Fire,</HI> 'till the Men have presented as they ought, nor wait too long after they have.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="005344_0048_10171E574537A1E0"/>
When the Battalion is to fire, the two Divisions of Drummers on the Right and Left, are to post themselves on the Flanks, and dress in a Line with the front Rank. When the Colour-Platoon makes ready, the Centre-Divisi∣on of Drummers are to move to the Platoons on the Right and Left of it, and when that Platoon has loaded again, they are to return to their Posts.</P>
<P>As soon as the first Firing is over, the Major orders a second Preparative to beat; at which the Platoons of the second Firing make ready, the Officers commanding those Platoons posting themselves in the same Manner as those of the first Firing did.</P>
<P>After this a Flam; when the first Platoon of the second Firing presents and fires, and the other Platoons of that Firing follow in their Order.</P>
<P>The same Method must be observed for the Platoons of the third Firing, as also for those of the Reserve; but before the Platoons of Grenadiers kneel and lock, they are to wheel to the Right and Left inward an eighth Part of the Circle, which as being on the Flanks, they are always to do, in whatever Firing they are placed, by which Means their Fire is thrown towards the Centre of the opposite Regiment, and consequently takes a great Part of their Front.</P>
<P>When the Colour-Platoon makes ready, the Colonel, Ensigns with their Colours, and Hautboys, are to move to the Platoons on the Right and Left: and when it has fired they are to return to their former Posts.</P>
<P>By the Platoon Exercise, the Men are to lead as soon as they have fired, and when loaded to shoulder.</P>
<P>The Battalion having gone through their Firings stand∣ing, we shall next shew how they are to perform them advancing.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>How to Fire advancing.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the Major's ordering the Drummers to beat a March, the whole Battalion is to march <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forward as
<PB N="50" REF="005344_0049_10171E278FBB1598"/>
slow as Foot can fall. The Officers in the Front are to be only two Paces advanced before their Platoons. The Offi∣cers in the Rear are to keep their former Distance.</P>
<P>When the Drummer ceases beating, which he is not to do, whether advancing or retiring, 'till he is ordered, the Battalion is to halt; and the Officers commanding the Pla∣toons are to place themselves on the Right and Left of the Platoons, facing towards the Colours.</P>
<P>Then the Preparative is to beat, at which the Platoons of the first Firing is to make ready. After that a Flam, to begin firing; which they are to perform in their Order.</P>
<P>As soon as they have fired, the Drummers must be or∣dered to beat a March; at which the Battalion moves for∣ward as before, the Officers in the Front marching at the Head of the Platoons; and the Platoons which have fired are to load in marching.</P>
<P>When you wou'd begin the second Firing, the Drum∣mers must be ordered to cease; at which the Battalion is to halt, and the Officers to post themselves on the Right and Left as before; then a Preparative for the Platoons of the second Firing to make ready; after that to proceed to fire as those of the first did.</P>
<P>The same Method is to be observed for the third Fire and the Reserve; the Grenadiers wheeling inward as is before directed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>How to Fire retiring.</HEAD>
<P>The Battalion having gone thro' their Firings in advanc∣ing, the Major is to order the Drummers to beat a Retreat; at which the Battalion is to face to the <HI>Right about</HI> upon their left Heels, and march very slow to the Rear. The Lieutenant Colonel at the Head of the Officers in the Rear, leads the Battalion. The Officers who were in Front march in the Rear of their Platoons, the Colonel in the Rear of the Ensigns.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="005344_0050_10171E5CC20B6060"/>
As soon as the Battalion has marched as far as is proper, the Major orders the Drummers to cease beating the <HI>Retreat,</HI> and give the <HI>Ruffle;</HI> at which the whole are to face to the <HI>Left about</HI> upon their left Heels.</P>
<P>When the Battalion is faced, the Major orders the Pre∣parative; at which the Platoons of the first Firing make ready, and the Officers in the Front fall into their Posts, as before directed: After this they are to fire in the same Manner as they did advancing.</P>
<P>As soon as these Platoons have fired, the Drummers beat a Retreat, at which the Battalion is to face again to the <HI>Right about,</HI> and march towards the Rear as before.</P>
<P>When the Drum ceases to beat the Retreat, and the <HI>Ruffle</HI> is given, the Battalion is to halt; then the Prepa∣rative for the Platoons of the second Firing is to make ready and fire, as those of the first Firing did.</P>
<P>In Retiring, the Meaning of the Word <HI>Halt,</HI> is to face to the proper Front, but in Advancing it is to stand still.</P>
<P>And the same Rules are to be observed for the third Firing, and the Reserve; which compleats the several Firings in Retiring.</P>
<P>And after they have perform'd the above Firings, it is customary to make one Fire by the whole Battalion.</P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Article IV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Foot are attacked by Horse, whether they are drawn up in the Line of Battle, or in a Square, it is proper for them to reserve their whole front Rank, and fire only the centre and rear Ranks by Platoons. In this Case the front Rank is not to fire 'till they are put to the last Extremity, and then not to fire 'till the Horse are so close that they have but just Time to charge their Bayonets

<P>And upon an Enemy's sudden Approach and attacking a Battalion in the Line of Battle, the following Method may be used, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>The two rear Ranks to be the first Fire.</P>
<P>The front Rank and Grenadiers the second Fire.</P>
<P>And again, The rear Ranks the third Fire.</P>
<P>At the Preparative, the two rear ranks make ready, and at the same Time the whole front Rank kneels and drop the Points of their Bayonetts to the Ground.</P>
<P>At the Word Fire, the rear Ranks fire; the front Rank and Grenadiers keep their Fire, the rear Ranks fall back two Paces and load with Expedition.</P>
<P>At the second Word Present, the front Rank and Gre∣nadiers present, and at the Word of Command they fire, then rise and charge their Bayonets Breast-high.</P>

As a Battalion is strong or weak, it may be told off ac∣cording to one of the foregoing Plans; as for Example.</P>
<P>A Battalion of Six Hundred Men may be told off ac∣cording to the first.</P>

<HEAD>Article V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Firing by Ranks.</HEAD>
<P>TO fire by Ranks, is meant to fire only one Rank of the Battalion at a Time, beginning first with the rear Rank, then the centre Rank, and last the front Rank. The Manner as follows,</P>
<P>The whole Battalion is to make ready at the same Time, and immediately <HI>kneel</HI> and <HI>lock.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Major gives the following Words of Com∣mand:</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="command">
<HEAD>Rear Ranks,—Present,—Fire.</HEAD>
<P>As soon as the rear Rank has fired, they are to recover their Arms, fall back to their former Distance, prime, load and shoulder.</P>
<P>After the rear Rank has fired, the Major proceeds:</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="command">
<HEAD>Centre Ranks,—Present,—Fire.</HEAD>
<P>After firing, the centre Rank recovers their Arms, falls back, primes, loads, and shoulders. When the centre Rank has fired, the front Rank is to do the same, either kneeling or standing up.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="005344_0053_10171E2F6D155220"/>
This Method of firing by Ranks is seldom or never used in Service, tho' sometimes practised in Exercise; but ano∣ther Method is now substituted in its Room; which is that of saving the Fire of the whole front Rank of the Battalion to the last, and firing the two rear Ranks by Platoons; it being the compact Fire which does the Execution requisite to break a Squadron; whereas the Fire of a single Rank is so thin that it will not easily stop their Progress if their Resolution don't fail them.</P>

<HEAD>Article VI.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="type of firing">
<HEAD>Parapet Firing.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Firing is only used in fortified Towns when besieged, in Intrenchments that are attacked, or that you are to fire over a Hedge or Wall at the Enemy.</P>
<P>There are two Ways of performing it; the one by Ranks, the other by Files.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="type of firing">
<HEAD>By Ranks.</HEAD>
<P>As the Breast-work, Parapet or Hedge is before the Men, they are obliged to fire standing, and therefore no more than one Rank can fire at a Time, which begins with the front Rank, who as soon as they have fired, are to form in the Rear, that the centre Rank may march up and fire; and when they have fired they are to form in the Rear also, that the rear Rank may do the same.</P>
<P>There are two Ways of doing it by Ranks; the one with the Files open, the other with them closed; but as the performing it with the Files closed is generally preferred, as containing the most compleat Fire, and doing most Ex∣ecution, that Method only is here inserted, and is as follows;</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="type of firing">
<PB N="55" REF="005344_0054_10171E6284233FF8"/>
<HEAD>Parapet firing by Ranks, with the Files closed.</HEAD>
<P>In this Case the Battalion must be told off by Platoons, leaving an Interval of a large Face between each. When the whole front Rank of the Battalion has fired, they are to recover their Arms, and face to the Left on their left Heels; but the left Hand Man of each Platoon must face to the <HI>Left about</HI> on his left Heel, which brings him opposite to the Interval on the left of his Platoon. As soon as they have faced, the left Hand Men of the Platoons are to march strait down their several Intervals to the Rear, all the rest follow∣ing them to the Left, and as each Man comes opposite to the Interval on the left of his Platoon, he is to face again to the Left, and march down the Interval, those of each Pla∣toon following their left Hand Men. As soon as the left Hand Man of each Platoon has got one Pace beyond the rear Rank, they are to face to the Left and continue march∣ing 'till they come to the Right of their own Platoons (the others following in File in the same Manner) and then halt, forming then the rear Rank, of which before they were the Front. After they are form'd in the Rear, they are immediately to load, and as soon as loaded to make ready, and march forward as before directed. When the front Rank has fired and marched clear of the Front, the centre and rear Ranks are to march forward, the Centre into the Ground of the first Rank, and the Rear into that of the Centre; then the centre Rank is to fire, recover their Arms, face to the Left, march down the Intervals, and form in the Rear of their own Platoons, as the front Rank did. The rear Rank is then to march forward, fire, and form in the Rear as the others.</P>
<P>This is a Sort of counter-marching by Ranks, by bring∣ing the Left of each Platoon to the Right, and the Right to the Left; with this Difference, that instead of keeping the same Station, each Rank in its turn forms the Rear, and as those before them fire, they move up to the former Ground.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="type of firing">
<PB N="56" REF="005344_0055_10171E30F76D9B10"/>
<HEAD>Parapet firing by Files.</HEAD>
<P>The Battalion must be fold off in Platoons, as in the other Firing, and drawn up three Paces distance from the Parapet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Whole ordered to make ready toge∣ther, as far as recovered Arms; and when the Signal is given for them to begin to Fire, the Files on the Right and Left of each Platoon (that is, one File from the Right, and one File from the Left of each Platoon) move forward, and when the File-Leaders come up to the Breast-Work, they are to face to the Right and Left inwards (that is, the right and left Hand Men of each Platoon face towards one ano∣ther) those of the Centre and Rear following their File-Leaders, 'till the two front Men join, and then they are to halt; by which the two Files of each Platoon form a Rank of six Men in the Front of their Platoons. As soon as they are thus form'd in the Front, they are to <HI>present,</HI> and <HI>fire;</HI> then recover their Arms, face to the Right and Left out∣wards, and march back to their own Places in the same Manner they came. When the first Files have fired, those Files which stood next them are to march out and draw up in the Front of their Platoons, in the same Manner as the others did, and fire; then recover their Arms and march back to their former Places. The two next Files of each Platoon are to march out, fire, and return to their former Places in the same Order as the others; and so on 'till the two centre Files have fired: After which the flank Files of the Platoons are to begin again, unless order'd to the con∣trary.</P>
<P>To avoid Confusion in the drawing up in the Front of their Platoons to fire, the File-Leaders should always form in the Centre as before directed; those Men of the centre and rear Ranks drawing up on the outside of them; which must be done when the two centre Files move out, they being to march up strait to the Parapet. And the Men of 
<PB N="57" REF="005344_0056_10170F57E9092080"/>
the centre and rear Ranks are to face outwards and draw up on the Right and Left of their File-Leaders: However it may be done otherwise, with the two centre Files of each Platoon, by making the File-Leaders face to the Right and Left outwards when they come up to the Parapet, bringing the Men in the Rear to form in the Centre of each Rank.</P>
<P>As soon as the Files are returned to their Places after firing, they are to face to their proper Front, prime, load, make ready, and wait with recovered Arms to fire again in their Turns; all which must be done without any further Word of Command than what was at first given to begin, and not to discontinue it 'till order'd so to do.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Article VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Street Firing.</HEAD>
<P>IT is so called from your being obliged to engage in a Street or narrow Passage, where no more than ten, twelve, sixteen, or twenty Files can march in Front; so that according to the breadth of the Place your Platoons must be stronger or weaker.</P>
<P>The Manner of performing it at Exercise, is thus; The rear Ranks are to be closed forward to close Order, and the Battalion is to wheel to the Right or Left by Platoons, in the same Manner as they do by Sub-divisions, only the Officers who are appointed to the Platoons, remain with and march at the Head of them; whereas, when a Regiment marches by Grand or Sub-division the Captains march all in Front and Rear: So that when the Officers are posted to the said Platoons, and march at the Head of them, it ought to be called marching by Platoons, in order to distinguish it from 
<PB N="58" REF="005344_0057_10171E33B0EC3350"/>
marching by Division; the one being formed for immedi∣ate Action, but the other only for common marching.</P>
<P>By the wheeling of the Platoons they fall in the Rear of one another, so that no more than one Platoon can fire at a Time.</P>
<P>As soon as the Platoons have wheeled, they should march in that Position, in order to open their Ranks to two Paces Distance: Besides, the Firing will appear more graceful when it is begun while the Regiment is in Motion.</P>
<P>When the Ranks are opened, and the whole Regiment in Motion, the Major should give the Signal for the Firing to begin; on which the Officer who commands the front Platoon is to halt his Men, order them <HI>to make ready, kneel, and lock,</HI> then <HI>present and fire;</HI> as soon as they have fired they are to recover their Arms, face from the Centre to the Right and Left outwards, march down the Flanks of the other Platoons, and form again in the Rear of the last, and immediately load and shoulder.</P>
<P>As soon as the Word <HI>Fire</HI> is given to the first Platoon, the Officer who commands the second must order his Men to make ready, and to march with recovered Arms to the Ground the first fired on, as soon as the others have got on the Flanks; and when his Men have <HI>kneel'd and lock'd,</HI> he is to give the Words <HI>Present, Fire;</HI> and when fired to recover, face outwards, march along the Flanks, and form in the Rear of the first. The rest of the Platoons are to observe the same Directions.</P>
<P>The Platoons are to keep up pretty close to one another, and to move or halt as those in Front do.</P>
<P>When this is to be put in Practice on real Service, the Front of the Platoons must not be equal to the breadth of the Place you engage in; but there must be a small Space of Ground left on your Flanks, that those who have fired, may, after they have faced to the Right and Left outwards, have Room to march back and form in the Rear.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="005344_0058_10171E6BE63BE338"/>
It is in this Manner, when you have not Time to raise a Breast-Work, that a Pass, Bridge, Road, or Street is to be maintained against an Enemy, by the Platoons sustaining one another, and firing in their Turns; which may be continued as long as there is Occasion, almost without Intermission, by one Battalion only.</P>

<P>THE Regiment must be told off by Grand and Sub-Divisions, and the Officers appointed to them, and the Files opened before the General comes, that after he has viewed them standing, they may immediately proceed to the Exercise. When Notice is given of the General's Coming, the Major is to order the Men to shoulder their Arms, him which Position they are always to rest their Arms when that Compliment is to be paid; and as soon as he approaches near the Flank of the Battalion, the Major is to order the Soldiers to rest their Arms by the following Words of Command:</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="005344_0059_10171E354969A718"/>
<HI>To the Front present your Arms.</HI></P>
<P>At the performing the fourth and last Motion of the above Command, all the Drummers are to beat a March, and the Major is to take his Post immediately on the Right of the Battalion, and the Adjutant on the Left, dressing in a Line with the Rank of Officers.</P>
<P>As the General passes along the Front, the Officers are to salute him with their half Pikes or Partisans; and to time it in such a Manner that each may just finish his Salute and pull of his Hat when he comes opposite to him.</P>
<P>The Ensigns who carry the Colours are to drop them (if the General is to be saluted with Colours) bringing the Spear pretty near the Ground, just when the Colonel drops the Point of his half Pike, pulling off their Hats at the same Time, and not raise the Colours 'till he has pass'd them.</P>
<P>As the Major and Adjutant are to be on Horseback, they are to salute with Swords; and when the Major has finish'd his Salute, he is to repair opposite to the Centre of the Re∣giment, that he may be ready to order the Men to face when the General goes round the Battalion.</P>
<P>And the Battalion is to be order'd to face to the Left as the General comes to the left Flank (supposing he began at the Right) and so again when he comes to the Rear, and right Flank, 'till be comes round again to the Front.</P>
<P>And the Major should be very careful in drawing up the Battalion, to do it in such a Manner that the right Flank may be open, that the General may come to it without Difficulty; for this End the Ground on which you are to be reviewed, and the Avenues leading to it should be considered. If this Particular is neglected, the Major or Officer who commands the Regiment, will be thought either careless or ignorant in his Profession, unless it plainly appear that Necessity and not Choice oblig'd him to it.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="005344_0060_10171E6D70BDC880"/>
When the Battalion is ordered to face, the Officers, Serjeants, Drummers, and Hautboys are to do the same, and all remain at their Posts, without going through the Battalion to the Rear, when the General passes along it, or saluting him any more than once standing.</P>
<P>The Serjeants in the Rear are to pull off their Hatts without bowing their Heads, when the General passes them, holding their Halberts in their right Hands, as the Officers do their half Pikes.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> When the Officers pull off their Hatts after saluting they are not to bow their Heads.</P>
