<HEAD>An Exhortation &amp; Caution TO FRIENDS Concerning buying or keeping of negroes.</HEAD>
<P>SEing our Lord Jesus Christ hath tasted Death as every Man, and given himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due time, and that his Gospel of Peace, Liberty and Redemption from Sin, Bondage and all Oppression, is freely to be preached unto all, without Exception, and that <HI>Negroes, Blacks</HI> and <HI>Tannies</HI> are a real part of Mankind, for whom Christ hath shed his precious Blood, and are capable of Salva∣tion, as well as <HI>White Men;</HI> and Christ the Light of the World hath (in measure) enlightened them, and every Man that cometh into the World; and that all such who are sincere <HI>Christians</HI> and true Believers in Christ Jesus, and Followers of him, bear his Image, and are made conformable unto him in Love, Mercy, Goodness and Compassion, who came not to destroy mens Lives, but to save them, not to bring any part of Mankind into outward Bondage, Slavery or Misery, not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to detain them, or hold them therein, but to ease and deli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Oppressed and Distressed, and bring into Liberty both inward and outward.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000636_0002_0FA9624E6F782538"/><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> And to buy Souls and Bodies of men for Money, to enslave them and their Posterity to the end of the World, we judge is a great hinderance to the spreading of the Gospel, and is occasion of much War, Violence, Cruelty and Oppression, and Theft &amp; Robery of the highest Nature; for commonly the Negroes that are sold to white Men, are either stollen away or robbed from their Kindred, and to buy such is the way to continue these evil Practices of Man-steal∣ing, and transgresseth that Golden Rule and Law, <HI>To do to others what we would have others do to us.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, in true <HI>Christian Love,</HI> we earnestly recom∣mend it to all our Friends and Brethren, Not to buy any Negroes, unless it were on purpose to set them free, and that such who have bought any, and have them at present, after some reasonable time of moderate Service they have had of them, or may have of them, that may reasonably answer to the charge of what they have laid out, especially in keeping 
<PB N="3" REF="000636_0003_0FA9624F0BF5DBF0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> under Age, that after a reasonable time of service to answer that Charge, they may set them at Liberty, and during the time they have them, to teach them to read, and give them a Christian Education.</P>
<P><HI>Some Reasons and Causes of our being against keeping of Negroes for Term of Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Because it is contrary to the Principles and Practice of the <HI>Christian Quakers</HI> to buy Prize or stollen Goods, which we bore a faithful Testimony against to our Native Country, and therefore it is our Duty to come forth in a Testimony against stollen Slaves, it being accounted a far greater Crime under <HI>Moses's</HI> Law than the stealing of Goods: for such were only to restore four fold, <HI>but he that stealeth a Man and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to Death, Exod.</HI> 21. 16. Therefore as we are not to buy stollen Goods (but if at unawares it should happen through Ignorance, we are to restore them to the Owners, and seek our Remedy of the Thief) no more are we to buy stollen Slaves; neither should such as have them keep them and their Posterity in perpetual Bondage and Slavery, as is usually done, to the great scandal of the <HI>Christian Profession.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Because Christ commanded, saying, <HI>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.</HI> Therefore as we and our Children would not be kept in perpetual Bondage and Slavery against our Consent, neither should we keep them in perpetual Bondage and Slavery against their Consent, it being such intollerable Punishment to their Bodies and Minds, that none but noto∣rious 
<PB N="4" REF="000636_0004_0FA9625014B73130"/>
Criminal Offendors deserve the same but these have done us no harme; therefore how inhumane is it in us so grievously to oppress them and their Children from one Ge∣neration to another.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Because the Lord hath commanded, saying, <HI>Thou shalt not deliver unto his Master the Servant that is escaped from his Master unto thee, he shall dwell with thee, even amongst you in that place which he shall chose in one of thy Gates, where it liketh him most, thou shalt not oppress him.</HI> Deut. 23. 15, 16. By which it appeareth, that those which are at Liberty and freed from their Bondage, should not by us be delivered into Bondage again, neither by us should they be oppressed, but being escaped from his Master, should have the liberty to dwell amongst us, where it liketh him best. Therefore, if God extend such Mercy under the legal Ministration and Dispen∣sation to poor Servants, he doth and will extend much more of his Grace and Mercy to them under the clear Gospel Mini∣stration; so that instead of punishing them and their Posterity with cruel Bondage and perpetual Slavery, he will cause the Everlasting Gospel to be preached effectually to all Nations, to them as well as others; <HI>And the Lord will extend Peace to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People like a River, and the Glory of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>like a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ring Stream; And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord, that I will gather all Nations and Tongues, and they shall come and see my Glory, and I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the Nations, to</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pull <HI>and</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>that draw the B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to</HI> Tub<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll <HI>and</HI> J<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>van, <HI>to the Isles afar off that have not heard my Fame, neither have seen my Glory, and they shall declare my Glory among the Gentiles, Isa. 66. 12. 18. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Because the Lord hath commanded, saying, thou 
<PB N="5" REF="000636_0005_0FA96250A3DFBF10"/>
shall not oppress an hired Servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy Brethren, or of the strangers that are in thy Land within thy Gates, least he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee; Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him, for ye were strangers in the Land of AEgypt, Deut.</HI> 24. 14, 15. Exod. 12. 21. But what greater Oppression can there be inflicted upon our Fellow Creatures, than is inflicted on the poor Negroes! they being brought from their own Country against their Wills, some of them being stollen, others taken for payment of Debt owing by their Parents, and others taken Captive in War, and sold to Merchants, who bring them to the <HI>American</HI> Plantations, and sell them for Bond-Slaves to them that will give most for them; the Husband from the Wife, and the Children from the Parents, and many that buy them do exceedingly afflict them and oppress them, not only by continual hard Labour, but by cruel Whippings, and other cruel Punishments, and by short allowance of Food, some Planters in <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> 'tis said, keeping one hundred of them, and some more, and some less, and giving them hardly any thing more than they raise on a little piece of Ground appointed them, on which they work for themselves the seventh dayes of the Week in the after-noon, and on the first days, to raise their own Pro∣visions, to wit, Corn and Potatoes, and other Roots, &amp;c. the remainder of their time being spent in their Masters service; which doubtless is far worse usage than is practised by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> upon their Slaves. Which tends to the great Reproach of the <HI>Christian Profession;</HI> therefore it would be better for all such as fall short of the Practice of those <HI>Infidels,</HI> to refuse the Name of a <HI>Christian,</HI> that those <HI>Heathen</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> may not be provoked to blaspheme against the blessed Name of Christ, by reason of the un∣parallel'd

cruelty of these cruel and hard hearted pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Surely the Lord doth behold their Oppressions &amp; Afflictions, and will further visit for the same by his righteous and just Judgments, except they break off their sins by Repentance, and their Iniquity by shewing Mercy to these poor afflicted, tormented miserable Slaves!</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Because Slaves and Souls of Men are some of the <HI>Merchandize of Babylon</HI> by which the Merchants of the Earth are made Rich; but those Riches which they have heaped together, through the cruel Oppression of these miserable Creatures, will be a means to draw Gods Judgments upon them; therefore, <HI>Brethren,</HI> let us hearken to the Voice of the Lord, who saith, <HI>Come out of</HI> Babylon, <HI>my People, that ye be not partakers of her Sins, and that ye receive not her Plagues; for her Sins have reached unto Heaven, and God hath remembred her Iniquities; for he that leads into Captivity shall go into Cap∣tivity,</HI> Rev. 18. 4, 5. &amp; 13. 10.</P>
