<P>WHEREAS the safety and freedom of every community depends greatly upon having the means of defence in its own power, and that the U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited Colo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies may not, during the continuance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir present important conte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for Liberty, nor in any fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure time, be under the expensive, uncertain and dangerous necessity of relying on foreign impor∣tations for Gun-Powder: And it being very certain from observation and experiment, that Salt-Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is to be obtained in great abundance from most par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of this Northern Continent; that the surface of the earth, in long used tobacco ware houses and their yards, or of common tobacco-houses, is particularly and strongly impregnated with Nitre.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That it be recommended to the Pro∣vincial Conventions of the tobacco Colonies, that as quickly as may be, they appoint one or more manu∣factories on each river, contiguous to the great in∣spection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and under the direction of persons quali∣fied by their skill and diligence to bring this impor∣tant business to a speedy and successful issue.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014585_0003_0F943320C003C8C0"/>To the Assemblies and Conventions of the other Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nies, it is recommended immediately to put in practice such other mode of making Salt-Petre, as may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound best adapted to their respective cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>That all persons may be encouraged to apply themselves to the manufacture of Salt-Petre, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recommended to the several Assembles and Conven∣tions to buy up, on account of the United Colonies, all the good and merchantable Salt-Petre at <HI>half a dollar</HI> fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each pound, that is, or shall be made in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir respective Colonies before the first day of October, 1776.</P>
<P>It is recommended that the collecting Sulphur be encouraged:—And it is recommended to the several Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vincial Conventions, to grant such premiums, for the refining of Sulphur in their respective Provinces, as ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be judged proper.</P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it is further recommended to the several Assemblies and Conventions that they cause mills to be erected, and skilful persons to be procured and employed for making Gun-Powder.</P>
<P>As Salt-Petre is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> article so necessary for defence, and in other respects so extensively useful, it is an object that not only requires the public patronage, but demands the attention of individuals: The fol∣lowing systems or methods of making Salt-Petre, suited to different circumstances and different mate∣rials▪ is recommended to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tention of the good people of these United Colonies.</P>

<P>SALT PETRE is to be found in tobacco houses, sta∣bles, cow houses, hen, and pidgeon houses, and in any covered place, where the influence of the Sun seldom reaches. A sixty feet tobacco house will yield upwards of sixteen hundred weight a year, and so in proportion for larger or smaller houses. In order to prepare the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors for attracting Nitre, all dung and other tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be re∣moved; and if the floors are not level, they must be made so by laying on marle, or any soil n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t too s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ff, which must be lightly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rod down with their feet.

The ground belonging to the house, perhaps an acre and an half, was filled with what we should call mud walls;—they were three feet thick at the bottom, and tapered up to one foot at top; heighth a∣bout five feet; these are placed so near each other that there is only room for a wheelbarrow to pass between: They are composed of street dirt and the rubbish of old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uildings, such as plaister, mortar, &amp;c. they are exposed to

<HEAD>An Account of the manufactory of Salt-Petre by Benjamin Rush, M. D. professor of Chemistry in the college of Philadelphia</HEAD>
<P>It has long been an opinion among chemists and natural historians, that salt petre is a natural production. It has been said to be found in large quantities on the surface of the earth in Persia, India and China, where it is said to im∣part a coldness to the atmosphere; but some late enquiries give us reason to suspect that the whole of these accounts are without foundation. They were prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly propagated by the natives of these countries, only to preserve in their hands the manufactory of so useful an article of trade. All the Salt Petre which is imported from the East-Indies is made by art. I would not be understood to mean, that this salt is never found in a native state. It is sometimes found adhering to large rocks. It is likewise found in a native state under the arches of bridges, and in vaults, or
<PB N="9" REF="014585_0008_0F94332625546580"/>
wine cellars; but in these places it is found in such small quantities, that we are seldom at the pains of collecting it. It is found in a larger quantity in a native state in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veral plants; but of this I shall say more hereafter.</P>
<P>The manufactory of salt petre is now no longer confined to the East Indies, but is carried on with equal advantages in many parts of Europe, particularly in Germany and France. I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll mention the several processes which are used for this purpose in each of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se countries.</P>

But there is another less equivocal method of knowing whether a plant contains any quantity of this Salt.
<PB N="13" REF="014585_0012_0F94332C192EB378"/>
Bruise the plant well and press the juice from it; put th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se juice into an earthern pot, and place it in a cool cellar, fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pouring a little sweet oil upon the surface of it, to prevent its becoming mouldy. If the plant contains any Nitre, you will find it in the form of crystals on the sides of the vessel, in six weeks or two months.</P>
<P>The method of extracting the Salt Petre is nearly the same, whatever ingredients we may employ for making it. The ingredients are put into tubs, barrels or hogsheads, perforated at their bottoms. Rain, river, or very pure spring water is poured upon them, which gradually dissolves all the salt they contain, and conveys it drop by drop into vessels provided to receive it. The Nitre in this state con∣tains a large quantity of common Salt. Before I explain in what manner this Salt is to be separated from the Nitre, it will be necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry to premise that bare <HI>evaporation,</HI> by b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iling or otherways, will chrystalize common Salt, but that <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> and <HI>rest</HI> are necessary to chrystalize Nitre. The <HI>Lee,</HI> (if I may so call it) made from the materials which yield Nitre▪ is put into a large copper vessel, and is gradu∣ally boiled away, till chrystals of common Salt begin to form in it. These are taken out with a ladle as fast as they form, and thrown into a large basket, which stands di∣rectly over the vessel in which the liquor is boiling—when no more chrystals of common Salt can be found, and when a pellicle begins to be formed on the surface of the liquor, it is taken off the fire, and emptied into a number of cop∣per or earthen pans, in a cellar, in which it soon shoots in∣to chrystals of salt petre. The salt has now undergone its first degree of purification. As a quantity of common salt still adheres to the chrystals of ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, it is necessary to dis∣solve them in pure water and boil them in the manner we said before. A much less quantity of common salt is ob∣tained now than formerly The nitre, after its second chrystalization, is used chiefly for the purposes of medicine,
<PB N="14" REF="014585_0013_0F94332CDA777788"/>
and caring provisions. But there is a third degree of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rification n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessary, before all the common salt c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n be com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pleatly separated from it. It is carried on in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner ss the former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t petre is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shig <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of purity, in which state only it is used for the manufact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of <HI>Gun Powder.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot conclude this memoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without observing, that the climate and productions of the middle and northern colonies of North-America render them ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remely proper for the manufactory of salt pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.

<P>HE procured the earth from under old buildings, which had no cellars; but he always avoided stables, and all other places, where the earths were impregnated wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h urinous and excrementici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us salts: He pref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the earths from under the oldest buildings and such as sme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d strong, and had somewhat of a bitterish or allum taste upon the tongue; with those kinds of earth he filled six half hog∣shead tubs, being previously carefully fixed for leech tubs, in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me manner as in drawing lee f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r soap or pot ash: he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled them near full of earth, which he left ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowing on the top; he then filled his tubs with light s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring or ri∣ver water, letting them stand twenty-four hours, that the salts might be thoroughly dissolved: he then drew off the liquor into receivers placed for that purpose, and if the first running was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul, he returned it on to the earth again▪ un∣til it came through clear.—When he had procured forty gallons of this Lee, he put it into a brass kettle for boiling; he then put water on the tubs as before, letting them stand other twenty four hours; he then drew it off, and put this

When he had filled his kettle wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h forty gal∣lons of lee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as above ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he boiled it down u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>til half was consumed.

He then poured the li∣quor into cedar kelors, made very flaring, holding 6 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quarts each, and then set it in a cool ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar, where it would (in about twelve hours) shoot into chrystals. The earth which he emptied out of his tubs, he laid in ridges under a shed, with a view (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter a certain time) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o work them ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. After the liquor had stood in his cooler a sufficient time to chrystalize, he gently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed his kelers up an edge, so as carefully to drain off the liquor from the chrystals, let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them stand in that position until the chrystals were drained dry, which he then took out of the k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lers, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt in a proper vessel, until he had procured enough for clari∣fying.—The liquor which he drained off from the chrystals, he always mixed with his next la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iling —His method of clarifying was this, (viz.)

to those under other buildings; but upon making the exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riment, I found such a mixture of common salt with the nitrous as to render the process qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e unprofitable, notwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hstanding I endeavoured carefully to follow his di∣rections of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pping out the common sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s while the liq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r was boiling. However, there is not the least doubt but that the earth under these places which have forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly been used f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r stables, but have been for several years neglected, will afford plenty of salt-petre.—It is to be observed, that all earths are not equally susceptable of nitrous salts, there∣fore we sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll find the earth under some old buildings plen∣tifully abounding with salt-petre, or nitre, whilst others are almost wholly destit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e thereof: so that it will be the sur∣est way to try a small quantity of the earths under those buildings which are pitched upon as promising, by taking (for instance) half a bushel of the earth, put to it water in a sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll leech tub properly fixed, so as to draw off about two gallons; boil this down, and filter it through a small quantity of ashes, by the same rule as is directed for forty gallons, which rule will serve for any quantity whatever. But it may be observed here, that we have the greatest rea∣son to doubt the gentleman's rule of boiling down all his liquors, so as to leave exactly an eighth part, before he set it to chrystalize.—It is natural to suppose that the earths under buildings are very various as to the quantity of nitre they contain, some being plentifully charged, whilst others are but lightly impregnated th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rewith. It is also certain that the nitrous sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s must be concentrated to a certain de∣gree, before they will chrystalize; or in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her words▪ the water that contains these nitrous salts mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e so far eva∣porated as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bring the saline particles within the sphere of each other's attraction, before they will unite and run together in chrystals; there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore it may (though I believe bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seldom) happen, that the liquor may be fit for chry∣stalizing bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re it is reduced to one eighth part; but that which will happen much more frequently is, that the ni∣trous salts will not be sufficiently concentra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for chrysta∣lizi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on boiling down to an eighth part; in that case, it will be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry to continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> boiling until by setting some of the liquor in a cool place in a spoon, or dropping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> few d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ops on a cold iron, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind it shooting into small chrystals, or some part of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> congealing like ice on the iron,

or at least until a particle or hard scum forms on the top of the boiling liquor.</P>
<P>Although I purpose to avoid entering into an abstruse definition of Salt Petre, yet it will be proper just to observe, that this substance is rationally supposed to be compound∣ed of three different materials, (viz) a nitrous acid, a vo∣latile animal salt, and these two fixed, blended together and petrified by a vegitable or mineral alkaline salt, and thus form what we commonly call Salt Petre.—This short definition of salt-petre will serve to shew the propriety of Mr. Glauber's collection of materials recommended in the forgoing processes; and it is ardently to be wished, that every gentleman who heartily desires the salvation and prosperity of America, would exert himself in encouraging and forwarding such kind of collections as soon as may be throughout this Colony.</P>
<P>But the question will very naturally arise, to know from whence the earths made use of in the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>regoing process, could derive either their volatile, annimal, or their vegitable alkaline salts.—It is no ways unnatural to suppose that as those earths had imbibed their nitrous qualities from the air which had found its way to their surfaces, so they might also receive from the same air a sufficient quantity of animal volatile salts, which had been exhaled from animal carcases and excrements, always putrifying on the surface of the earth. As to the vegitable alkaline salt, which is said to be the basis of Salt Petre, I should not have expected a suf∣ficiency from the unchanged filtering tub of ashes, which was all the alkaline that gentleman made use of. Howe∣ver, experiments may be very easily tried, to determine this matter, by mixing a small quantity of lime or ashes with a tub of the above earth, before it is lixiviated, and then lix∣iviating the same qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntity and kind of earth, without either lime or ashes, and see which produces the most Salt Petre.</P>
