<P>HAVING brought our <HI>Annals</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND down to the Settlement of the <HI>Massachusetts Colony</HI> in the 1st <HI>Volumn;</HI> and having lately received a most au∣thentick and valuable <HI>Journal</HI> of Events relating to said Colony,—From the Time when their 1st Gov <HI>Winthrop,</HI> Dep. Gov <HI>Dudley,</HI> Eleven <HI>Assistants,</HI> with their Charter, <HI>Four</HI> Ministers &amp; about 1500 People were waiting at the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> &amp; <HI>other Places</HI> in the <HI>South</HI> &amp; <HI>West</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to sail for <HI>this desired Land;</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> From <HI>Monday March</HI> 29. 1630, to <HI>Jan.</HI> 11. 1648, 9: Wherein are many Remark∣ables not to be found any where else; and whereby alone we are enabled to <HI>correct</HI> many Mistakes, and <HI>ascertain</HI> the <HI>Dates</HI> of many Articles in others;—all wrote with the said Gov WINTHROP'S own Hand, who deceas'd in the very House I dwell in on the 26th of <HI>March</HI> after: I may now proceed with a further Enlargement of Intel∣ligence, and with a greater Certainty and Exactness.</P>
<P>And for my Readers greater Satisfaction I shall also go on, as I did before, to give them, <HI>not my own Expressions,</HI> but those of the <HI>Authors</HI> who lived in the Times they wrote of; excepting now and then a Word or Note of <HI>mine</HI> for <HI>Explanation Sake,</HI> distinguished from <HI>theirs</HI> by being inclosed in such <HI>Marks</HI> as [These].

Mr. <HI>Hubbard,</HI> and <HI>Others,</HI> telling us the remarkable Events of the Times they liv'd in.</P>
<P>But as I was unhapily obliged to close the <HI>former Volumn</HI> abruptly in <HI>September</HI> 1630, about 2 <HI>Months</HI> after our entering the 2d <HI>Section</HI> of the IId <HI>Part;</HI> I must re∣fer to <HI>That,</HI> and begin the IId <HI>Volumn</HI> with <HI>September</HI> 28, in Continuation of the 2d SECTION Containing Articles from the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the <HI>Settle∣ment</HI> of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> or 2d <HI>Colony,</HI> to the <HI>Settlement</HI> of the 7<HI>th</HI> and <HI>last,</HI> by the Combination of 41 Persons into a Form of Government at <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> on <HI>Oct.</HI> 22. 1640, afterwards call'd <HI>the Province of New-Hampshire.</HI></P>

The <HI>Committee</HI> meet at <HI>Roxbury:</HI> And upon further Consideration, for [3] Reasons it is concluded we shou'd <HI>not</HI> have a <HI>Town</HI> in the Place aforesaid; (1) Because Men wou'd be forc'd to keep 2 Families; (2) There is no running Water; and if there are any Springs, they won't suffice the Town; (3) The most of the People have built already, and wou'd not be able to build again: So we agree to meet at <HI>Waterton,</HI> this Day sennet, and in the mean Time <HI>other Places</HI> shou'd be viewed. <HI>(w)</HI></P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Neale</HI> and 3 other Gentlemen come to us [at <HI>Boston</HI>]: He came in the Bark <HI>Warwick</HI> this <HI>Summer</HI> to <HI>Pascatoway,</HI> sent as <HI>Governor There</HI> for Sir <HI>Ferdinand Gorge</HI> and <HI>others. (w)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 21. We meet again at <HI>Waterton:</HI> And Here, upon View of a Place a Mile beneath the Town, all agree it a fit Place for a <HI>fortified Town;</HI> and we take Time to con∣sider farther about it.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 24. Till this Time there was (for the most Part fair open Weather, with gentle Frosts in the Night: But <HI>this Day</HI> the Wind comes N W very sharpe and some Snow; but so Cold that some have their Fingers froze and in Danger to be lost. <HI>(w)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 26. <HI>[Lord's-Day]</HI> The Rivers are froze up: and they of <HI>Charleston</HI> cou'd not come to the <HI>Sermole</HI> at <HI>Boston</HI> till the Afternoon at High-Water. <HI>(w)</HI></P>

<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 22. <HI>Richard Garret</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> with 1 of his Daugh∣ters a young Maid, and 4 others, against the Advice of their Friends, went towards <HI>Plymouth</HI> in a Shallop: and about the <HI>Gurnet'</HI>s Nose, the Wind blew so much at N W, as they were put to Sea, and the Boat took in much Water, which froze so hard as they cou'd not free her: so that they gave themselves for Lost; and com∣mitting themselves to God, dispos'd themselves to die. But one of their Company espying <HI>Land</HI> near <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> they made a shift to hoist up Part of their Sail, and by God's special Providence were carried thro' the Rocks to the Shoar: where some got on Land; but some had their Leggs frozen in the Ice, so as they were forced to be cut out. Being now on Shoar they kindle a Fire; but hav∣ing no Hatchet, they can get but little Wood, and are forc'd to lie in the open Air all Night, being extreamly cold. In the <HI>Morning</HI> 2 of their Company go towards <HI>Plymouth.</HI> (Supposing it within 7 or 8 <HI>Miles,</HI> where as it is near 50 from them) [and <HI>not</HI> an <HI>English</HI> House nearer] By the Way they meet 2 <HI>Indian Squaws,</HI> who telling their Husbands they had met 2 <HI>Englishmen</HI> that had been Ship∣wrack't, make after them and bring them back to their <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and entertain them kindly: and one of them [<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> of the <HI>Indians</HI>] next Day goes with them to <HI>Ply∣mouth:</HI> and the other [<HI>Indian</HI>] goes to find out their <HI>Boat</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="007301_0011_102B2538F03A86F0"/>
and the Rest of their Company which are 7 Miles off: and having found them, helps them what he can, returns to his <HI>Wigwam,</HI> fetches a Hatchet, builds them a <HI>Wigwam,</HI> covers it, gets them Wood: (for they were so weak and frozen, as they cou'd not stir) and <HI>Garret</HI> dies about 2 Days after his Landing; and the Ground so frozen as they cou'd not dig his Grave, the <HI>Indian,</HI> with his Hatchet, hews a Hole about half a Yard deep, [puts the] Corps in it, and lays over it a great Heap of Wood to keep it from the Wolves. By this Time the Gov of <HI>Plymouth</HI> sends 3 Men to them with Provisions; who launch'd their Boat, (which the Wind had driven up to high Water Mark) and with a fair Wind get to <HI>Plymouth:</HI> where <HI>another</HI> of their Company <HI>dies,</HI> his Flesh being mortified with the Frost: and the 2 who went towards <HI>Plymouth died</HI> also; <HI>one</HI> of them being not able to get thither, and the <HI>other</HI> had his Foot so frozen as he died of it after. The <HI>Girl</HI> escaped best: and one <HI>Harwood,</HI> a godly Man of the Congregation of <HI>Boston,</HI> lies long under the Surgeon's Hand. <HI>(w)</HI></P>

It goes harder with this poor People in their Beginnings, because of the <HI>Scarcity</HI> of all Sorts of Grain this Year in <HI>England:</HI> Every <HI>Bushel</HI> of <HI>Wheat Meal</HI> standing them in 14 <HI>Shillings</HI> [Sterl.] and every <HI>Bushel</HI> of <HI>Peas</HI> 10 <HI>Shillings;</HI> and not easy to be pro∣cured neither. <HI>(b)</HI> [And] coming into this Country, we found some <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Salem,</HI> and some few at <HI>Charlestown,</HI> who were very destitute: and Planting Time being past; shortly after, Provision was not to be had for Money. And the unsubdued Wilderness yielding little Food, many were in <HI>great Straits</HI> for want of <HI>Provision</HI> for Themselves &amp; their little Ones. We quickly built Boats, and some went a Fishing. <HI>Bread</HI> was with many a very scarce Thing, and <HI>Flesh</HI> of all Kinds as scarce: And Oh the <HI>Hunger</HI> that many suffered, and saw no Hope in an Eye of Reason to be supplied, but with <HI>Fish, Clams</HI> and <HI>Muscles.</HI> But God caus'd his People to be contented with mean Things, and to trust in him. <HI>(c)</HI></P>

<HEAD>III. Accounts of the 13 Magistrates who came this Year with the Charter, as far as I have met with.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Gov.</HI> His <HI>Ancestor</HI> was <HI>Adam Win∣throp;</HI> a worthy Gentleman [in <HI>England:</HI>] who had <HI>a Son</HI> of the <HI>same Name,</HI> a discreet, learned Gentleman, eminent for Skill in the <HI>Law,</HI> not without Remark for his Love to the <HI>Gospel</HI> under the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII; and <HI>[another Son]</HI> a memorable Favourer of the Reform'd Religion in the Days of Q <HI>Mary,</HI> into whose Hands the famous Martyr <HI>Philpot</HI> committed his Papers, which afterwards made no inconsiderable Part of our <HI>Martyr Books. This</HI> Mr. <HI>Adam Winthrop</HI> had a Son of the <HI>same Name,</HI> Endowments and Imployments with his <HI>Father.</HI> And this 3d Mr. <HI>Adam Winthrop</HI> was Father to this renowned <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> who is the Founder of a <HI>Colony,</HI> which on many Accounts like him that founded it, may challenge the 1st Place among the Glories of <HI>America.</HI> Born at the Mansion House of his Ancestors at <HI>Groton</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI> on <HI>July</HI> 12 1587: [had] an agreable Education: But the Accomplishments of a <HI>Lawyer</HI> were those where with Heaven made his chief Opportunities to be serviceable. Being at the Age of 18 made a <HI>Justice of the Peace,</HI> his Vertues began to fall under a more general Observation [was] not only exemplary for his Conformity to the Laws of Christianity in his Conversation, but also discover'd a more than ordinary Measure of those Qualities which adorn an Officer of <HI>human Society.</HI> His <HI>Justice</HI> was impartial: His <HI>Wisdom</HI> excel∣lently temper'd Things according to the Art of Governing: His <HI>Courage</HI> made him dare to do Right: All which Vertues he rendered the more illustrious, by emblazoning them with the constant <HI>Liberality</HI> and <HI>Hospitality</HI> of a Gentleman. This made him the Terror of the Wicked, the Delight of the Sober, and the Hope of those who had any hopeful Design in Hand for the Good of the Nation &amp; the Interest of Religion. Accord∣ingly when the noble Design of carrying a <HI>Colony</HI> of chosen People into an <HI>American Wilderness,</HI> was by some eminent Per∣sons undertaken; this eminent Person was, by the Consent of all, chosen for the <HI>Moses,</HI> who must be the Leader of so great an Undertaking: Wherefore having sold a fair Estate of 6 or 7 <HI>Hundred</HI> [Sterling] a Year, He [now] transmitted Himself with the Effects of it into <HI>New-England; (cm)</HI> [in the 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>st Year</HI>

of his <HI>Age:</HI> Is the 1st <HI>Governour</HI> of the <HI>Massachusetts Colony;</HI> one of the 5 Undertakers; the 1st <HI>Member</HI> who join'd in form∣ing the <HI>Congregational Church</HI> of <HI>Charlestown</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> and the <HI>Principal Cause</HI> of fixing on <HI>Boston</HI> for the <HI>Metropolis.</HI>]</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Thomas Dudley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> D Gov. Born at <HI>Northampton</HI> in 1574 [rather 1576] the only Son of Capt. <HI>Roger Dudley;</HI> who being slain in the Wars left this our <HI>Thomas;</HI> who in the Fami∣ly of the E of <HI>Northampton</HI> [learn'd] the Points of <HI>good Beha∣viour,</HI> and fitted himself to do many Benefits to the World: <HI>Next</HI> became a Clerk to Judge <HI>Nichols</HI> (who being his Kinsman by the Mother, took the more special Notice of Him) [improv'd the] Advantage to attain such Skill in the <HI>Law,</HI> as was of great Advantage in the future Changes of his Life: and the Judg wou'd have prefer'd him to higher Employments, whereto his prompt Wit not a little recommended Him, if he had not been by Death prevented. But before He cou'd do much at the <HI>Pen,</HI> for which he was very well accomplished, He was call'd to the <HI>Sword:</HI> For being a young Gentleman well known for Ingenuity, Courage and Conduct; when Soldiers where to be rais'd by Order of Q <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for the Service of K <HI>Henry</HI> IV [of <HI>France</HI> against the <HI>Sponiards</HI> on the <HI>Borders</HI> of the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI> in 1597] none of the [Youths] about <HI>Northampton</HI> were willing to enter the Service till a <HI>Commission</HI> was given to young <HI>Dudley</HI> to be their <HI>Captain;</HI> and then presently 4 <HI>Score</HI> listed under him. At the Head of these he went over; was at the Siege of <HI>Amiens;</HI> and thus came to be furnished for the <HI>Field</HI> as well as the <HI>Bench:</HI> But [the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> making Peace in <HI>June</HI> 1, 1598,] He return'd to <HI>England,</HI> settled [near] <HI>Northampton;</HI> married a Gentlewoman, whose Extract and Estate were considerable, and the Scituation of his [Dwelling] help'd him to enjoy the Ministry of Mr. <HI>Dod, Cleaver, Winston,</HI> and <HI>Hildersham,</HI> excellent and renowned Men: which <HI>Puritan</HI> Ministry so seasoned his Heart with Religion, that he was a devout Christian, and a Follower of the Ministers that most effectually Preached <HI>Real Christianity</HI> all his Days. The Spirit of <HI>Real Christianity</HI> in him now also disposed him to sober <HI>Non∣conformity,</HI> and from this Time, (tho' none more hated the <HI>Fanaticisms</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasms</HI> of <HI>wild Opinionists</HI>) He became a judicious Dissenter from the <HI>unscriptural Ceremonies</HI> retained in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> Not long after this, the Lords <HI>Say</HI> and

In this [Business] Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> continued about 9 or 10 <HI>Years:</HI> but then growing desirous of a more private Life, retir'd to <HI>Boston</HI> [in <HI>England</HI>] where the Ministry and Ac∣quaintance of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> [were] no little Satisfaction to him. But the <HI>Earl</HI> cou'd be no more without Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> than <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI> without his <HI>Joseph,</HI> and prevailed with him to resume his former Employment; till the <HI>Storm</HI> of <HI>Persecution</HI> on the <HI>Non∣conformists</HI> caused <HI>many Men</HI> of <HI>great Worth</HI> to transport them∣selves to <HI>New-England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> was not the least of the worthy Men [who] bore a Part in this Transportation, in Hopes that in an American Wilderness they might peaceably enjoy the the pure Worship of Christ. And when the <HI>Undertakers</HI> for [this] Plantation came to know him, they soon saw <HI>That</HI> in him, that caus'd them to chuse him their <HI>Dep Gov:</HI> In which Capacity he [now] arrived <HI>(cr)</HI> [here, in the 54th Year of his <HI>Age:</HI> was one of the 5 <HI>Undertakers;</HI> the 2d <HI>Member</HI> in forming the <HI>Con∣gregational Church</HI> of <HI>Charlestown</HI> and <HI>Boston;</HI> and a principal <HI>Founder</HI> of the Town of <HI>Newtown,</HI> after called <HI>Cambridge;</HI> being zealous to have it made the <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and is one of the 1st who builds and settles <HI>There</HI> in the <HI>Spring ensuing.</HI>]</P>
