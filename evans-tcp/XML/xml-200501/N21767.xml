<HEAD>An ORATION ON MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O this audience, I have the honor and pleasure to address myself, as a friend to the po∣lite art of music; and to in∣vestigate the nature, the beau∣ty, and the civilizing and religious effects of melody, when suitably and feelingly practised, is my present design.</P>
<P>I have full assurance that no one will censure me as ostentatious in this laudable task; to which I am invited by the si∣lence of others—that upon this principle I shall meet with your forgiveness, for assuming the place, in which many in this audience who are friends to music would have done better justice, and greater ho∣nor to this pleasing and beautiful art: which is too much neglected, to the great detriment of the cultivation of genius, to
<PB N="4" REF="028650_0004_0FDA39CA99B95B90"/>
the sweets of society, and especially to religious worship.</P>
<P>MUSIC is the gift of Heaven—a foun∣tain of joy on earth—the earnest of a future inheritance in unspeakable Glory; the theme of saints and angels above; and the highest adoration ever paid to Deity: which I shall attempt to prove both from its nature, and from sacred writ Consequently, if it is the highest adoration which saints, or angels, can pay to Deity, it is his darling delight; for it must have been his object, from eternity, to glorify himself, in the crea∣tion, salvation, and happiness, of his de∣pendent creatures, whose duty it is to acknowledge him, as he has revealed him∣self in the harmonious system of nature; both in creation and formation; and to do it with all the faculties of the soul, in the most elevated accents we are capable of; for that which falls short of giving him all the praise, and the whole heart is idolatry; and according to our belief of things, in a sense displeasing to God, as expressed in sacred writ.</P>
<P>MUSIC is a deep art, when viewed in its true principles: the plan or ground work of music, is allowed by those who have made great proficiency, in the vari∣ous
<PB N="5" REF="028650_0005_0FDA39CE6FE58D08"/>
arts, and sciences, which are brought to great perfection; to afford the great∣est field for contemplation, to give the greatest exaltation of thought, and to afford the sweetest amusement of all the various arts and sciences of the schools <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed so great is the art of music, that we find but few who have become real Masters; although many profess, and thousands pay the most assiduous atten∣tion to it, who are possessed of bright ge∣nius, and a high esteem for the art. It may be argued by some, that acquire∣ments in music, depend upon a certain taste, or fondness for it; but the reverse of this is evident; for there are but few who have no ears for music, and many who have the most accurate ears, who are great performers, and will sing every piece of music they hear, and therefore may be said to have a talent for music; who have not that penetration of thought▪ by which they can by the closest attention become masters of the art. Indeed, among those who understand the composition of mu∣sic, there is a great difference in the gran∣deur, and majesty of their pieces; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t may with propriety be said that few minds have the greatness to become useful to mankind, in the composition of
<PB N="6" REF="028650_0006_0FDA39CFE34D2BA0"/>
music. Another argument, to vindicate that fleeting fancy can never comprehend the principles of music is, that he who writes music, must have a most feeling sense of the words to which he annexes his music; for unless the musician is skilled in the spirit of the subject, and has a feeling sense of it too, he can never write good music: for music is is always designed to express our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eas, in a more feeling manner, and with higher anima∣tion of soul, than is possible from the impressions of silent reflection, or the dull sounds of emphasis, and cadence in speak∣ing. And as the great use of music, is to assist in public worship, in addressing, and paying homage to Deity; and in setting forth the greatness, and wisdom of God; it requires an exalted mind, suitably to express the greatness of the subject, in accents of harmony, and the sweetness of the voice.</P>
<P>MUSIC is calculated to refine the man∣ners to encrease the sensibility, and sweet∣en the temper: the first by exciting youth to attend public worship; which is cal∣culated to polish and refine the manners, independent of its religious effects. No∣tice a family, or neighborhood, which seldom attend religious worship for a
<PB N="7" REF="028650_0007_0FDA39D177DCA0F0"/>
length of time, and you will commonly see a set of clowns.</P>
<P>MUSIC is calculated to promote litera∣ture, by the ambition which is always ex∣cited among youth by public perfor∣mance: and exclusive of music, there is none which can be called suitable, and subservient to public good: dancing may be said to be a public performance; true it is in a sense, and greatly discovers bo∣dily activity; gives a familiar address, and acquaintance with good manners: but is chiefly calculated to entertain those indi∣viduals who compose the ball. To com∣mit to memory, pieces, and tragedies on various subjects, is practised in schools, and academies: and to deliver them on certain days appointed for that purpose; which much excites ambition, and creates confidence in youth; but perhaps not one to fifty are qualified for public speak∣ers, or ever become elegant orators; and are seldom of great use to society, by hav∣ing learnt to speak a few pieces, which are then worn out, dismissed, and soon forgot. And the fair sex, are seldom ever favored with the opportunity of serving their com∣munity, by public performance, except through the medium of music.</P>
<P>WHO can flight so liberal, so polite
<PB N="8" REF="028650_0008_0FDA39D660EBC3D0"/>
an art? by which gentlemen and ladies, of every sect and rank, may associate to∣gether, in a most entertaining and useful manner.</P>
<P>THUS music is pleasing, and greatly strengthens society, as it cultivates friend∣ship; and especially as it marks no dif∣ferent sectarian; for almost all denomin∣ations of men are ready to sing together, and view it as a very essential part of pub∣lic worship—Psalmody is calculated to entertain almost every member of socie∣ty, who has arrived to years of under∣standing; both the cheerful and the sed∣ate, the old and the young: Thus the fire of ambition kindles with their voices to please the audience, which together with the subject of their melody, gives a decent confidence and exquisite delight</P>
<P>FRIENDLY and religious societies are very intimately connected, and depend∣ent on each other: so those things which prove baneful to the one, commonly do so to the other; whereas those things which are of salutary tendency to the one, are equally so to the other.</P>
<P>Music is a very great help to religion, as without this part of public worship, much less attention would be paid to it. Both vocal and instrumental music, have
<PB N="9" REF="028650_0009_0FDA39D7562AAAD8"/>
a tendency to excite many to attend pub∣lic worship, who would otherwise neglect; whereas it must be allowed that assem∣bling together, which we are commanded to do, has a greater tendency to promote religion than the contrary: It likewise serves as a spur to religion, by awaken∣ing the careless to a sense of the words they sing; and by arousing the sleepy saint indeed without music, public wor∣ship is apt to sink into dull and heedless formalities; almost without the appear∣ance of religion.</P>
<P>I PRESUME that every musician will a∣gree in this, that he who sings well, whe∣ther the subject be love, praise, or a de∣scription of the wisdom and perfections of Deity, has an elevation of thought, and transport of soul, which none but the mu∣sician ever felt.</P>
<P>MUSIC gives eyes to explore the beau∣ty, and wings to rise, to the high palace of the happified being above; and if we in this life, do ever anticipate the extatic joys of the celestial regions above; if the aspiring thought of finite beings, is ever elevated, to join with the Angelic host, in the high praises of the king of glory; it is when our voices are employed in melo∣dious
<PB N="10" REF="028650_0010_0FDA39D8D778C230"/>
accents, to express in a more feel∣ing and lively manner, those noble psalms of David, the songs of solomon, and other beautiful modern productions, in tunes and anthems.</P>
<P>NATURAL reason, and daily observa∣tion teaches us, that the benefit we de∣rive from music, in a great measure de∣pends upon the variety of it; for to sing but one tune, or to be confined to a cer∣tain set of tunes, would create indiffer∣ence, and inattention to music; for in this, as in almost all impressions which are made upon the senses, a repetition of the same impression, renders us less suscepti∣ble of it; till at length, that which was at first pleasing, becomes a matter of in∣difference, and its salutary effects upon the mind in a great measure cease: as in the dull formality of a family prayer, which has been repeated every morning, and evening, for many years without the least alteration except that which is acci∣dental. It is evident, that a great varie∣ty of objects, are well accommodated to the variety of tastes, so as to afford a va∣riety of amusements; why then should we slight, and contemn, this great source of happiness, of which God is the author. There is in the art of music, a great field
<PB N="11" REF="028650_0011_0FDA39DD74C42208"/>
for variety▪ which must first be explored, by the assiduous application of great minds, when imprest with the reality of important truths; &amp; is then suited to the lowest, as well as the most exalted capa∣city. Rigidity, and superstition, are the companions of partiality, in the choice of the most innocent, and laudable amuse∣ments; and are commonly affrighted at the sight of a novelty; whereas they are diametrically opposed to improvements, and are as a great wall of separation be∣twixt us, and the light of knowledge. Mu∣sic is the great theme of the inspired writ∣ers; and it remains to be proved from scripture, that it is the gift of heaven; a fountain of joy on earth; the earnest of a future inheritance in unspeakable glo∣ry; the theme of saints and angels above; and the highest adoration ever paid to Deity, as before asserted.</P>
<P>David was a man after Gods own heart, and a great musician; he frequently calls upon the righteous: and all nations like∣wise, to bless and praise the Lord, and to sing praises and play skillfully with a loud noise: he not only invites to sing but to use musical instruments to assist the voice.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Rejoice in the LORD ye righteous, for praise is comely for the vpright. Praise
<PB N="12" REF="028650_0012_0FDA39DFDB5BCCA8"/>
the LORD with harp, sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. Sing unto him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise. Make a joyful noise unto GOD all ye lands, sing forth the honors of his name, make his praise glorious. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for thou shalt judge the people righteously. Sing unto God, sing praises to his name; extol him that ri∣deth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. Sing aloud unto GOD our strengh, make a joyful noise unto the GOD of Jacob; take a psalm, and bring hither the tabret, the pleasant harp and the psaltery; blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed on our solemn feast day; for this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most high; to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery, with a solemn sound.</HI></Q></P>
<P>SOUND abstractly considered, cannot with propriety be called adoration, nor a fountain of joy; any more than we can conceive of sin, or holiness separate from rational beings, inclined to evil or good: —but the sense in which singing may be
<PB N="13" REF="028650_0013_0FDA39E4B1A6FFA0"/>
considered a fountain of joy, &amp;c. Is▪ that it is the most joyful mode of rejoic∣ing; and that by which we express those emotions which we call adoration, in the most feeling and elevated manner; and not only so, but it begets emotions, ex∣cites ideas and improves the mind.</P>
<P>THE four first propositions laid down relative to music are too lucid▪ even to deserve a comment; for the Psalmist fre∣quently exhorts to rejoice, and sing prais∣es. Christ himself when on earth but a few hours previous to his being crucified sang an hymn with his disciples
<Q>and when they had sang an hymn they went out in∣to the mount of Olives,</Q>
as though that was the most agreeable, and most expressive of their affections for each other;—as much as to say our last and parting in∣terview, and highest token of friendship is singing; for we expect soon to join in an eternal song of Glory.</P>
<P>IT remains to be proved that singing is the highest adoration ever paid to Dei∣ty.
<Q>And they sung a new song saying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation▪
<PB N="14" REF="028650_0014_0FD9BB683616AA18"/>
and hast made us unto God, kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth. And I be∣held and I heard the voice of many angels, round about the throne, and the beasts, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, worthy worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory and blessing.</Q>
The song of redemption and salvation, is the greatest that ever was sung in earth, or heaven; because the work of redempti∣on and salvation is the greatest, and the most glorious: therefore as they praised God for it in a song, it follows that it is the highest adoration ever paid to Deity; for if there had been any form more a∣dequate to this sublime employment, it would certainly have been adopted, to the neglect of singing.—The revelator has also a view of new music in heaven, as expressed above.
<Q>And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers, harping with their harps; and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders.</Q></P>
<P>It is needless to quote any more pas∣sages
<PB N="15" REF="028650_0015_0FDA39E9A486A5A0"/>
of scripture respecting singing as it would render my essay prolix.</P>
<P>Now will this audience
<Q><LG>
<L>Permit my muse, to waft along:</L>
<L>And paint the beauties of a song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sweet music, refinement, politest of arts;</L>
<L>Reformer of manners; the badge of good hearts;</L>
<L>The bond of society; angel of love;</L>
<L>The offspring of heaven, and born from above.</L>
<L>The beauties of Music, are concord and love;</L>
<L>The joyfulest harmony, native above;</L>
<L>It softens the manners, and sweetens the heart;</L>
<L>Enlivens the spirits and makes them alert;</L>
<L>'Twill drown all sorrows of fortune, and fate;</L>
<L>In family, neighborhood, county and state.</L>
<L>O music the ladder on which we may climb,</L>
<L>To things more celestial, to things more sublime.</L>
<L>Enraptur'd in music, we waft on thy wings,</L>
<L>Immortal felicity; where the song rings:</L>
<L>The echo re-echo's, and echos again;</L>
<L>The melody suffers no discord within;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="028650_0016_0FDA39EAD81E2608"/>There swallow'd in pleasure, eternally sing,</L>
<L>The glories, and beauties of our heav'n∣ly king.</L>
<L>No soul in that region of harmony sweet,</L>
<L>But drinks into musics, wide ocean com∣plete:</L>
<L>Their voices are sweeter than words can express;</L>
<L>Their hands are uplifted, clad with righ∣ousness;</L>
<L>On wings they are mounted, on wings they do fly;</L>
<L>While shouting, and singing, with My∣riads nigh;</L>
<L>Infinitude swells with their warbleing notes;</L>
<L>Their voice is the ocean in which they do float.</L>
<L>My soul that's immortal, begin in their song;</L>
<L>I'll sing till united to that heav'nly throng.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Let me desire you to pardon the Muse, for such boldness of expression; and to consider that poets think they may take great liberty that way.</P>
<P>If singing is as before asserted, the highest adoration ever paid to Deity, and his darling delight; of what importance
<PB N="17" REF="028650_0017_0FDA39EC57033088"/>
is it that we pay due attention to it.</P>
<P>My friends let me remind you of the parable of the good and slothful servants; and to consider whether those who neg∣lect the voice, are as the slothful ser∣vant, who hid his Lords money,—bu∣ried the talent that was given him, and incurred the Lord's displeasure. As singing is that form of worship which is most pleasing to God as has been prov∣ed; those who neglect to cultivate the voice bury a great talent, for which they will be obliged to give an account, and then they will say,
<Q><L>Alas! how mistaken in object of choice,</L>
<L>In point of amusement, to neglect the voice.</L></Q></P>
<P>LET me solicit your attention to a few observations, negatively setting forth in a few words those things which tend to discord, and are in their nature op∣posed to Music. Those who are oppos∣ed to music if there be any in this assem∣bly, may think me partial in my essay, if I omit a description of discord.</P>
<P>THOSE sounds which clash with each other, so as to excite horror, and disgust the ear, are discord; and the term dis∣cord is frequently used to signify disa∣greement in neighborhood and in socie∣ty;
<PB N="18" REF="028650_0018_0FDA39F056C68548"/>
thus we say of a people where quar∣rels abound, they are lovers of discord: those who are busy to propagate slander are lovers of discord: those who are bias∣ed by national prejudices are inclined to discord: those who are filled with the prejudices of education in general are much inclined to discord: those who condemn all but those of their denomi∣nation are much inclined to discord: those who contemn and speak evil of e∣very body but themselves, and will countenance nothing but for the sake of their own emolument, are fit for masters of discord, and are so fond of it, that they devote up their whole time to com∣position without any reward, except the pleasure of hearing new jargon. Every thing which falls short of treating man∣kind according to their true merit, is strictly discord, in that degree in which it differs from that fitness of things, which we call harmony; because it stands op∣posed to society, and is certainly opposed to all good.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to conceive of society among the lovers of discord; as the whole composition of their minds is a mass of heterogeneous combustible, which being put into action enkindles to a flame of
<PB N="19" REF="028650_0019_0FDA39F3D7DE88E0"/>
discord, and confusion. Let me quit this painful task; an investigation of the principles of discord, and I would chari∣tably hope there is not one such in this audience. Let me invite the friends to Music and harmony, to distinguish them∣selves by their exertions to promote it. We wish all the blessings of life, health and peace to attend you in this life; and are assured, that the coming world, will afford you an eternal and joyful theme.</P>
<P>BUT, what will be the porrtion of the lovers of discord in a coming world, is hard to tell; but if we may be allowed to imitare the langurge of sacred writ,
<Q>As he loved cursing so let it come unto him, as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him:</Q>
It will stand thus; As he lo∣ved discord, so let it come unto him; as he delighted not in harmony, so let it be far from him.</P>
<Q>What remains is an address, first to my ho¦norable Preceptor, and then to my fellow students in Music.</Q>
<P>THE polite, and honorable post which you now hold by virtue of merit; enti∣tles you to the notice, and attention of every person of merit, and reputation. It becomes us who have received your
<PB N="20" REF="028650_0020_0FDA39F55529BD68"/>
salutary instructions, in the rudiments of the art of music, gratefully to acknow∣ledge you as our preceptor and friend. May you never have the displeasure to see or hear, that we slight the benefit which you have conferred upon us, by forgetting to attend to Music, and so losing what knowledge we have acquired under your tuition. The highest mark of gratitude we can express towards you, is to persevere in Music; and to slight, and neglect it would be the very grossest ingratitude.</P>
<Q>Gentlemen and ladies of the school of music.</Q>
<P>LET me address you in the style of a hearty friend to the cause—May we ev∣er refrain from those things which tend to discord, and frequently give a stain, which is never wiped away. May we long have the pleasure of singing toge∣ther in friendship; and never let too much vanity possess our minds, when singing sacred words.</P>
<P>THAT an acquaintance with music, may render us useful members of society, an ornament to the public worship of GOD, and an honor to the art we profess;</P>
<P>THAT it may be our happy lot to escape the snares of him who is the father of discord and lies; and to have an admit∣tance
<PB N="21" REF="028650_0021_0FDA39F8AF605778"/>
to the mansions of of peaceful har∣mony, where love and adoration, furnish an eternal song, is the desire of your sin∣cere FRIEND;</P>
