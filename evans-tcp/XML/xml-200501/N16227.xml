<OPENER>RESOLVED,</OPENER>
<P>THAT the preceding Constitution be laid before the United States in Congress assem∣bled, and that it is the opinion of this Conventi∣on,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now the honour to submit to the consideration of the United States in Congress assembled, that constitution which has appeared to us the most adviseable. The friends of our Country have long seen and de∣sired, that the power of making war, peace and treaties, that of levying money and regulating commerce, and the correspondent Executive and Judicial authorities, should be fully and effectually vested in the general government of the Union; but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trusts to one body of men is evi∣dent—Hence results the necessity of a different organization.</P>
<P>IT is obviously impracticable in the federal government of these States, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all—In∣dividuals entering into society, must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be reserved; and on the present occa∣sion this difficulty was encreased by a difference among the several States as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="020801_0027_0FB0FBD3EF15B218"/>IN all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true Ameri∣can, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, per∣haps our national existence. This important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of inferiour magni∣tude than might have been otherwise expected; and thus the Constitution which we now pre∣sent, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation render∣ed indispensible.</P>
<P>THAT it will meet the full and entire ap∣probation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will doubtless consider, that had her interests been alone consulted, the con∣sequences might have been particularly disagree∣able or injurious to others; that it is liable to as few axceptions as could reasonably have been expected, we hope and believe; that it may promote the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all, and secure her freedom and hap∣piness, is our most ardent wish.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With great respect. We have the honour to be, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient, And humble servants, GEORGE WASHINGTON, President.</SIGNED>
