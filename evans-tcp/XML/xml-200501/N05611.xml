<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Need say but little by way of Preface, in relation to the Usefulness of this Book, the Title Page so fully declaring its Contents: But as a Preface is usually expected, I must and cannot well avoid saying something with respect to its Utility.</P>
<P>As to the first Step of forming the young Man's Mind for Business, <HI>viz.</HI> The being instructed in, and acquainted with our Mother Tongue, <HI>viz. English,</HI> it must and is acknow∣ledged by all, to be a due and principal Qualification in writing Business, and therefore it is necessary to be there∣with well acquainted.</P>
<P>Then in the next Place, to write a good, fair, free, and commendable Hand, is as necessary in most, if not in all the Affairs of Life, and Occurrences of Business.</P>
<P>The next Thing touched on, is in relation to the inditing of some few Epistles or Letters in a familiar Stile, and on sundry Subjects and Occasions: With Directions how to subscribe or conclude a Letter, and also to superscribe or direct Letters, according to the different Ranks and Qualities of the Persons to whom directed: And this cannot be deny'd but to be a

<P>The next Accomplishment for a young Man, and large<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> treated on in this Book, is that excellent Science <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> both Vulgar and Decimal: Leading him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hand, and by easy Steps, through its whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Again the young Man is next shewn the ingenious Art o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Book-keeping after the <HI>Italian</HI> Manner, by way of Doubl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Entry; and that is an Accomplishment that capacitates hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Business in the highest Degree: Under which Head, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is also informed how to draw out or make various Sorts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Accompts or Writings, relating to Mercantile Affairs; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bills of Lading, Invoices, Accompts of Sales, together with authentick Examples of Bills of Exchange, with Notes concerning them; likewise Bills of Parcels of divers Kinds; also various Sorts of Receipts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which is expedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a young Man to know and understand, if he would be dextrous in Business.</P>

<P>To the whole is added, some prudential Advice to a young Tradesman or Dealer; which, if observ'd, may, with God's Blessing, make his Fortune.</P>
<P>In the <HI>British</HI> Edition of this Book, there were many Things of little or no Use in these Parts of the World: In this Edition those Things are omitted, and in their Room many other Matters inserted, more immediately useful to us <HI>Americans.</HI> And many Errors in the Arithmetical Part are here carefully corrected.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUTH, To SPELL, READ, and WRITE TRUE ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Use of Great and Small <HI>Letters;</HI> how to divide them into Vowels and Consonants; what Diphthongs are, their Numbers, and how pronounced and written.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Subject Part of this Book being to in∣struct Young (as well as Old) People, in the general Rules of Business and Conversation thereunto belonging, the first Step I shall take for forming the Mind for Business, is that most necessary Accomplishment, the Spelling and Writing good and proper <HI>English</HI>; for let a Person write ne∣ver so good a Hand, yet if he be defective in Spelling, he will be ridiculed and contemptibly smiled at, notwithstanding his fair Writing; and which will, indeed, make his Ortho∣graphical Faults be more conspicuous. But to the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We are to take Notice, that of Letters are made Syllables, of Syllables Words, and of Words, Sentences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Letters are in Number 24; to which if you add <HI>j</HI> and <HI>v</HI> Consonants, being of a different Shape and Sound from the rest, they make 26. As to the Letters, we are to observe their Names, their Form, and their Force: Their Names, whereby to know them; their Form, whether great or small; and their Force in Pronounciation or Utterance.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007120_0006_0000000000000000"/>Letters are distinguished, according to their Sound, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vowels and Consonants: A <HI>Vowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is a Letter that soundet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by itself, and they be five in Number, <HI>viz. a, e, i, o, u,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>y,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Vowel; which also is a Vowel in <HI>English,</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it cometh after a Consonant, and hath the Sound of <HI>i</HI>; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>by, sly, reply,</HI> &amp;c. A <HI>Consonant</HI> is a Letter that soundet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, except it be joined with a <HI>Vowel,</HI> for without one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Vowels no Syllable can be made; as, <HI>b, c, d, &amp;c.</HI> with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out the Aid of a <HI>Vowel,</HI> make nothing: So that <HI>Vowels</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Consonants</HI> may be compared to <HI>Nouns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubstantive</HI> and <HI>Noun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Adjective,</HI> each requiring the other's Assistance. Though w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have but 24 Letters, and 6 of them <HI>Vowels,</HI> yet we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 21 <HI>Consonants</HI>; for <HI>j, v,</HI> and <HI>y,</HI> when they are set befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any <HI>Vowel,</HI> in the same Syllable, become <HI>Consonants</HI>; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was said before concerning <HI>y</HI>; as in <HI>Jupiter, Juno, Jilt, vulgar▪ violent, vigour,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Note,</HI> That <HI>j</HI> Consonant hath the Soun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>g,</HI> as in <HI>j in, jangle, jingle,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>When two <HI>Vowels</HI> come or meet together in a Word, and are not parted in the Pronounciation, but united in one Sound such are called <HI>Diphthongs</HI>; being 13, <HI>viz. ai, ei, oi,</HI> and <HI>ui, au, eu, ou, ee, oo, ea, eo, oa,</HI> and <HI>ei</HI>; as in <HI>maid, faith▪ either, join, aul, eunuch, stout, feed, seed, food, brood▪ stealth, wealth, people, st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eple, boat, goat, heat, beat, feat▪ friend, field,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Note,</HI> That in the first 7 Words, bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Vowels</HI> are sounded; but in the other 15, one of them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scarcely heard.</P>
<P>There are also those that are called <HI>Tripthongs,</HI> where thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Vowels</HI> meet in one Sound, as in <HI>Beauty, Beau, Lieu,</HI> and <HI>View</HI>: Likewise <HI>ay, ey, oy, uy, aw, ew,</HI> and <HI>ow</HI> become <HI>Diphthongs,</HI> at the End of Words, but are called <HI>improper Diphthongs</HI>; as in <HI>say, key, joy, saw, bow,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Letters Great and Small, and when to be used.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST Negatively▪ <HI>Great Letters</HI> are not to be used in the Middle or latter End of a Word, except the whole Word be so written, as JEHOVAH, LORD, or Titles of Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For it would be very absurd to write thus: To Mr. geoRgE RoGeRs In thaMes StReEt.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st, Great Letters,</HI> or <HI>Capitals,</HI> are written at the Begin∣ning of Sentences; as, Fear God. Honour the King. Know when to speak, and when to hold your Tongue.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI>▪ After every Period, or Full Stop, when new Mat∣ter begins. As, Some time after that Accident, another fol∣lowed,
<PB N="3" REF="007120_0007_0000000000000000"/>
which was this, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> London, May 16. Turin, June 12, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> All Proper Names of Persons, Places, Ships, Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are to begin with a Capital; as, <HI>George, London,</HI> the <HI>Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adnought, Thames, Severn</HI>: All Christian Names and Surnames, both of Men and Women, must begin with a Great Letter; as, <HI>Samuel Sharp, Mary Sweeting,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> The more eminent Words in a Sentence; as Faith is the Foundation of the Christian Religion; or, any Word that we have a particular Regard or Deference for; as, <HI>God, Christ, King, Queen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> At the Beginning of every Line in Poetry; as,
<Q><L>Improve your Time: Time passeth quickly on;</L>
<L>Nor doth so good succeed, as that that's gone.</L></Q></P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly,</HI> All Names of Arts, and Sciences, and Trades; as, <HI>Writing, Arithmetick, Geometry, Musick, Carpenter, Smith,</HI> &amp;c. And evermore the Personal Pronoun <HI>I,</HI> and the Inter∣jection <HI>O,</HI> must be Capitals.</P>
<P>For it is ridiculous to write thus; <HI>On Monday last i came to your House, but you was not at Home; then i went,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> I think I may venture to give a general Rule when Capitals are to begin Words, which is this; All Nouns Sub∣stantive may begin with a great Letter; and a Substantive may be known by the Signs either of <HI>A, An,</HI> or <HI>The,</HI> before them; as, <HI>a House, a Mill, an Ox, an Ass, the City, the River,</HI> &amp;c. And I think the Adjective (which declares what Sort of a Thing the Substantive is) may be with a Small, and the Substantive with a Great Letter; as, <HI>the white Horse, the long Rope, brown Bread, fat Beef,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Small Letters are commonly written in all other Places, as Verbs of the Active and Passive Voice, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Observations concerning the Sound of Letters, and which are omitted in Pronounciation.</HEAD>
<P>A, Is not sounded in <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> nor in <HI>Sabbaoth,</HI> but as if written <HI>Pharo,</HI> and <HI>Sabboth</HI>; neither in <HI>Marriage,</HI> but as <HI>Marrige</HI>; also <HI>Parliament</HI> as <HI>Parliment,</HI> and <HI>Chaplain</HI> as <HI>Chaplin,</HI> &amp;c. In some proper Names it is not sounded, but drop'd in the Pronounciation; as in <HI>Aaron, Isaac, Canaan, Balaam,</HI> which are pronounced as if written <HI>Aron, Isac, Canan, Balam</HI>; but we must except <HI>Ba-al,</HI> and <HI>Ga-al. A</HI> is sounded broad like <HI>aw,</HI> in Words before <HI>ld</HI> and <HI>ll</HI>; as in <HI>bald, scald, ball, wall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007120_0008_0000000000000000"/><HI>B</HI> is not sounded in <HI>thumb, dumb, plumb, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, doubt, debt, subtle,</HI> &amp;c. but sounded as if written <HI>thum, dum, plum lam, dout, det, suttle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>C</HI> is sounded hard like <HI>K,</HI> before <HI>a, o,</HI> and <HI>u,</HI> and before <HI>l</HI> and <HI>r</HI>; as in these Words, <HI>cane, came, comb, cub, clay, crane, crab</HI>; and soft in <HI>cement, city,</HI> and <HI>tendency; C</HI> loseth its Sound in <HI>scene, science,</HI> and <HI>victuals,</HI> and in <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dict,</HI> likewise in <HI>indict, indictment</HI>; also before <HI>k,</HI> as in <HI>stack, rack, stick, thick, brick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ch</HI> is sounded like <HI>K,</HI> in Words of Foreign Extraction, and in many proper Names of the holy Scripture; as in <HI>Chorus, Chymist, Chrysostom, Christ, Chederlaomer, Baruch, Archippus,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ch</HI> in <HI>French</HI> Words sound like <HI>sh,</HI> as in <HI>Chevalier,</HI> pronounced as <HI>Shevalier: Machine</HI> as <HI>Masheen, Mareschal</HI> as <HI>Marshal, Capuchin</HI> as <HI>Capushen, Chaise</HI> as <HI>Shaze,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>D</HI> is not sounded in <HI>Ribband,</HI> nor in <HI>Wednesday,</HI> but pro∣nounced as <HI>Ribbin,</HI> and <HI>Wensday</HI>; the Termination <HI>ed</HI> is shortened into <HI>t</HI>; as <HI>burned, burnt; choaked, choakt; ripped, ript; passed, past; choped, chopt</HI>; &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>E</HI> is not sounded in <HI>heart,</HI> neither in <HI>hearth,</HI> or <HI>dearth,</HI> &amp;c. and seldom heard but in Monosyllables; as in <HI>me, he, she, ye, the,</HI> &amp;c. where it hath the Sound of <HI>ee</HI>; but in Words, derived from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek, e</HI> hath its perfect Sound, as, <HI>Jesse, Jubile, Mamre, Nineve, Candace, Cloe, Eunice; Penelope, Salmone, Phebe, Epitome, Catastrophe, Gethsemane,</HI> and from the <HI>Latin simile,</HI> and <HI>premunire,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>E final,</HI> or <HI>e</HI> at the End of a Word, serves to lengthen the Sound, and to distinguish it from other Words without <HI>e,</HI> which are sounded short; as in these Examples following, <HI>viz. cane, can; hate, hat; bite, bit; fare, far; hope hop; made, mad; mane, man; scrape, scrap; stare, star; tune, tun; write, writ</HI>; &amp;c. And in Words of more than one Syllable, length∣ens the Sound of the last Syllable, but doth not increase the Number of Syllables; as, <HI>admire, demise, blaspheme,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>E</HI> lengthens the Syllable in <HI>Tyre, Kenite,</HI> and <HI>Shu-la-mite. E</HI> must not be made to lengthen a Syllable, when it is made short by two Consonants; as in <HI>pass, turn, black</HI>; not <HI>passe, turne, blacke.</HI> Words ending in <HI>cre, gre,</HI> and <HI>tre,</HI> Sound the <HI>e</HI> before the <HI>r,</HI> as in these Words; <HI>acre, lucre, centre, se∣pulchre; tygre, maugre, mitre, lustre</HI>; which are sounded as if writen <HI>aker, luker, senter, sepulker, tyger mauger, miter,</HI> and <HI>luster.

<HI>g,</HI> as in <HI>ace, place, lace, spice, truce, oblige, huge, age,</HI> &amp;c. If Nouns in <HI>e final</HI> take <HI>s</HI> after them with an Apostrophe be∣fore it, it stands for <HI>his,</HI> as the <HI>Pope's Eye,</HI> or the <HI>Eye of the Pope.</HI> If without an Apostrophe, it makes the Plural Num∣ber, as <HI>Tables.

<P><HI>F</HI> in Plurals is changed into <HI>v,</HI> as, <HI>strife, strives, staff, staves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G</HI> is not sounded in <HI>sign, reign,</HI> neither in <HI>gnaw, gnat, assign, design, seignior, seraglio, phlegm,</HI> &amp;c. but sounded as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>senior, seralio, fleme. G</HI> is sounded soft in <HI>gender, ginger,</HI> and <HI>gipsy</HI>; but hard in <HI>Gibeon, Giberah, Gilboa, Geth-semane,</HI> and hard also in these Proper Names, <HI>Gibson, Gilman,</HI> and <HI>Gilbert</HI>; and likewise in these common Words, <HI>gelt, geld, gird, gimp, geese, gander, gabble, gather, gild,</HI> &amp;c. Ob∣serve, That if <HI>G</HI> be <HI>hard</HI> with a long Vowel, <HI>ue</HI> is joined and pronounced in the same Syllable; as in <HI>Plague, Prague, Hague, rogue, league, dialogue, catalogue,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Gh</HI> in the End of some Words, where <HI>au</HI> or <HI>ou</HI> goes be∣fore, hath the Sound of <HI>ff,</HI> as in <HI>tough, rough; cough, laugh,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded as if <HI>tuff, ruff, coff, laff</HI>; but <HI>huff, cuff, snuff,</HI> and <HI>buff,</HI> must be so written.—<HI>Gh</HI> is not sounded in <HI>mighty, though, through,</HI> neither in <HI>daughter,</HI> or <HI>Vaughan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>H</HI> hath Place, but no Sound, in <HI>Chrystal, Chronicle, Christ, Ghost, John, Rhine, Schedule,</HI> and <HI>Schism.

<P>The longest <HI>Monosyllables</HI> we have in <HI>English,</HI> are <HI>length, strength,</HI> and <HI>streights</HI>; which still would be nothing, without the Vowel <HI>e</HI> and <HI>i.</HI></P>
<P>All Spelling may be taken in, under these four following general Rules, or Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> When a <HI>Consonant</HI> comes between two <HI>Vowels</HI> in di∣viding the Word into <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yllables,</HI> the <HI>Consonant</HI> is joined to the latter Vowel; as in <HI>sta-ture, na-ture, de-li-ver, u ni-ty, &amp;c.</HI> except compound Words, which terminate in <HI>ed, en, est, eth, er, ing, ish,</HI> and <HI>ous</HI>; as <HI>coasted, gold-en, know-est, know-eth, bear-er, fool-ing, bar-ba-rous, ra-ven-ous,</HI> and <HI>sub-urbs.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> When two <HI>Consonants</HI> come together in the Middle of a Word, they are to be parted if not proper to begin a Word; as <HI>num-ber, stran-ger, for-tune, &amp;c.</HI> not <HI>numb-er, strang-er, fort-une:</HI> To this Rule is excepted, Words with <HI>x,</HI> as <HI>ox-en, ex-er-cise, &amp;c.</HI> When the same Consonant is doubled
<PB N="10" REF="007120_0014_0000000000000000"/>
in a Word, the first belongs to the foregoing, and the latter to the following Syllable, as in the Rule above, and in these words, <HI>Ab ba, ac-cord, an-no, ad-der, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly, Consonants</HI> that can begin Words, must not be parted in the Middle; as <HI>a-gree, be-stow, re-frain, &amp;c.</HI> not <HI>ag-ree, bes-tow, ref-rain.</HI>—These <HI>Consonants</HI> may begin Words, <HI>viz. bl, br, ch, cr, dr, dw, fl, fr, gh, gl, gr, kn,</HI> &amp;c. as <HI>blunt, break, chaw, cry, draw, dwell, flesh, ghost,</HI> &amp;c. On the Contrary, <HI>Consonants</HI> that cannot begin Words, must be parted in the Middle, as in <HI>Sul-tan,</HI> and as said above.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> When two <HI>Vowels</HI> come together, not making a Diphthong, they must be divided; as in <HI>vi-al, va-li-ant, Li-o-nel, du-el, cru-el, me-te-or,</HI> and <HI>La-o-di-ce-a.</HI></P>
<P>Some particular Notes.</P>
<P><HI>L</HI> is doubled in Words of one Syllable; as <HI>well, tell, swell, ball, wall, fall, will, hill, mill,</HI> &amp;c. But in Words of more than one Syllable, the Word always te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minates with single <HI>l,</HI> as, <HI>angel, Babel, hurtful, dutiful,</HI> and <HI>beautiful.</HI> Neither must <HI>l</HI> be doubled in <HI>alway, also, although</HI>; not <HI>all-way, all-so, all-though,</HI> &amp;c. But Words accented on the last Syllable, must be excepted from the Rule above, <HI>viz. install, recall, inroll, rebell,</HI> and <HI>repell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Y</HI> must be used before the Termination <HI>ing,</HI> as <HI>buying, ly∣ing, carrying, marrying, paying, slaying, burying,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The long <HI>s</HI> must never be used at the End of a Word, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediately after the short or small <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>X</HI> should be used instead of <HI>ct,</HI> where it appears to have been in the Original; as <HI>reflexion connexion,</HI> rather than <HI>re∣flection,</HI> or <HI>connection,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>Colon</HI> (:) two Points</P>
<P><HI>Period</HI> () a single Point at the Foot of a Word.</P>
<P>, <HI>Example of the</HI> Comma.) There is not any thing in the World, perhaps, that is more talk'd of, and less understood, than the Business of a happy Life.</P>
<P>; <HI>Example of the</HI> Semicolon.) It is not a Curse that makes way for a Blessing; the bare Wish is an Injury; the Moderation of <HI>Antigonus</HI> was remarkable.</P>
<P>: <HI>Example of the</HI> Colon.) A sound Mind is not to be shaken with popular Applause: But, Anger is startled at every Accident.</P>
<P>. <HI>Example of the Period</HI>) It is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> says <HI>Fabius,</HI> for a Commander to excuse himself, by saying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was not aware of it. A Cruelty that was only fit for <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rius</HI> to suffer, <HI>Sylla</HI> to command, and <HI>Cataline</HI> to act.</P>
<P>By the Examples foregoing, we may easily note, that a <HI>Comma</HI> is a Note of a short Stay, between Words in the Sentence; and therefore the Tenor of the Voice must still be kept up.—The <HI>Semicolon</HI> is a little longer, and the Tone of the Voice very little abated.—The <HI>Colon</HI> signifies perfect Sense, though not an End of the Sentence; and the Voice a little abated, or let fall.—The <HI>Period</HI> denotes perfect Sense, and the End of the Sentence.</P>
<P>? When the Question is asked, there is a crooked Mark made over the Period thus? and is called a Note of Interro∣gation: <HI>Example,</HI> What could be happier than the State of Mankind, when People lived without either Avarice or Envy? The Time of Pause for this Stop, is the same with the <HI>Semicolon.</HI></P>
<P>! If a sudden Crying out, or Wondering, be expressed, then this Mark is made over the Full Stop, thus! and called
<PB N="22" REF="007120_0026_0000000000000000"/>
a Note of Admiration, or Exclamation. <HI>Example,</HI> Oh the astonishing Wonders that are in the elementary World!</P>
<P>() If one Sentence be within another, of which it is no Part, then 'tis placed between two Semicircles or Parenthesis, made thus () <HI>Example, Pompey,</HI> on the other Side (that hardly ever spake in Publick without a Blush) had a wonder∣ful Sweetness of Nature. Again, if Authors be sure to make Choice of the best; and (as I said before) to stick close to them. Once more; Honour thy Father and Mother (which is the first Commandment with Promise) that it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e well with thee.—In reading a Parenthesis, the Tone must be somewhat lower, as a Thing or Matter that comes in by the bye, breaking in as it were on the main Coherence of the Period. The Time is equal to a Comma, and ought to be read pretty quick, lest it detain the Ear too long from the Sense of the more important Matter.</P>
<P>' <HI>Apostrophe</HI> is a Comma at the Head of Letters, signify∣ing some Letter or Letters left out for quicker Pronounciation; as <HI>I'll</HI> for <HI>I will, would'st</HI> for <HI>wouldest, sha'n't</HI> for <HI>shall not, ne'er</HI> for <HI>never, is't</HI> for <HI>is it, 'tis</HI> for <HI>it is, i'th'</HI> for <HI>in the, o'er</HI> for <HI>over</HI>: Or to denote a Genitive Case; as, my Fa∣ther's House, my Uncle's Wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>/ <HI>Accent</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over a Vowel, to denote that the Stress of Sound in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is on that Syllable.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Breve</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mark over a Vowel, signifies it must be sounded short or quick.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Caret</HI> signifies something is wanting, and is placed under∣neath the Line, just where any thing omitted, by Mistake, or Forgetfulness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be brought in.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Circumflex</HI> is of the same Shape with the Caret, but is placed over some Vowel, to shew the Syllable to be long, as <HI>Eu-phrâ-tes.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Dialysis,</HI> or two Points placed over two Vowels in a Word, signifies they are to be parted, being no Diphthong.</P>
<P>- <HI>Hyphen,</HI> or <HI>Note of Connection,</HI> is a straight Line; which being set at the End of a Line, shews that the Syllables of that Word are parted, and the Remainder of it is at the Be∣ginning of the next Line; and sometimes is used in com∣pound Words; as Burnt-sacrifices, Heart-breaking, Soul-healing, Book-keeper, <HI>&amp;c. N. B.</HI> That when you have not Room to write the whole Word at the End of a Line, but are obliged to finish it at the Beginning of the next, such Words must be truly divided, according to the Rules of
<PB N="23" REF="007120_0027_0000000000000000"/>
Spelling; as re strain, not—res∣train. When the Hyphen is placed over a Vowel, it is properly a Dash, and signifies the Omission of <HI>m</HI> or <HI>n</HI>; it is much used in old <HI>Latin</HI> Authors, and sometimes in <HI>English,</HI> especially in Law Business. <HI>Example</HI>; It is very comēdable to write a good Hand.</P>
<P>☞ <HI>Index,</HI> is a Note like a Hand, pointing to something very remarkable.</P>
<P>* <HI>Asterism,</HI> or <HI>Star,</HI> directs to some Remark in the Mar∣gin, or at the Foot of the Page. Several of them together, denote something defective, or immodest, in that Passage of the Author.</P>
<P>† <HI>Obelisk,</HI> is a Mark like a Dagger, and refers to the Margin, as the <HI>Asterism</HI> *; And in Dictionaries, it signifies the Word to be obsolete, or old, and out of use.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>Paragraph,</HI> denotes a Division, comprehending several Sentences under one Head.</P>
<P>§ <HI>Section,</HI> signifies the Beginning of a new Head of Dis∣course, and is used in sub dividing a Chapter, or Book, in∣to lesser Parts or Portions.</P>
<P>[] <HI>Brackets</HI> or <HI>Crotchets,</HI> generally include a Word or Sentence, explanatory of what went before; or Words of the same Sense, which may be used in their Stead.</P>
<P>" <HI>Quotation,</HI> or double Comma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is used at the Beginning of the Line, and shews what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from an Author to be in his own Words.</P>
<P>Thus much for Pointing, Stops, and Marks; which, if carefully heeded and observed, will add Grace and Credit to your Writing.</P>

<HEAD>To hold the Pen.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pen must be held somewhat sloping, with the Thumb and the two Fingers next to it; the Ball of the Middle Finger must be placed strait, just against the up∣per Part of the Cut or Cradle, to keep the Pen steady▪ The Fore Finger lying strait on the Middle Finger; and the Thumb must be fixed a little higher than the End of the Fore Finger, bending in the Joint; and the Pen be so placed, to be held easily without griping. The Elbow must be drawn pretty close to the Body, almost to touch it. You must support your Hand, by leaning on the Table Edge, resting on it, half way between your Wrist and Elbow, not suffering the Ball, or fleshy Part of your Hand to touch the Paper; but resting your Hand on the End of your Little Finger, that and your fourth Finger bending inwards, and supported on the Table as abovesaid. So fixed, and sitting pretty upright, not leaning your Breast against the Table, proceed to the making the small <HI>o,</HI> the <HI>a, e, c, i, m, r, s, w,</HI> and <HI>x</HI>; which must be all made of equal Bigness and Height, the Distance or Width between the two Strokes of the <HI>n,</HI> must be the same with the Distance or Width of the three Strokes of the <HI>m</HI>; the same Proportion of Width must be observed in the <HI>u, w,</HI> and <HI>o.</HI> The Letters with Stems or Heads, must be of equal Height; as the <HI>b, d, f, h k, l,</HI> and <HI>s.</HI> And those with Tails▪ must be of equal Depth▪ as the <HI>f, g, p, q,</HI> and <HI>s.</HI> The Capitals must bear the same Pro∣portion one to another, with respect to Bigness and Height, as <HI>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,</HI> and <HI>I, &amp;c.</HI>—This Proportion of Letters, both of Small and Great, must be observed in, and will serve for, all Hands whatsoever. <HI>N.

Sit not long at wri∣ting (that is, no longer than you improve) especially at the first, lest it weary you, and you grow weary of Learning. Imitate the best Examples, and have a constant Eye at your Copy; and be not ambitious of writing fast, before you can write well: Expedition will naturally follow, after you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained a Habit of writing fair and free; and 'tis much more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommendable to be an Hour in writing six Lines well, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be able to write sixty Lines in the same Time, which per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aps is perfect Scribble, and altogether unintelligible.

<HEAD>Of Secret Writing.</HEAD>
<P>HHRE it may not be improper to say something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Secret Writing; to which Bishop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> in his Boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Mathematical Magick,</HI> speaks largely; but it is princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pally concerning Writing in Cypher, which requires gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Pains, and an uncommon Share of Ingenuity, both in Write<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="55" REF="007120_0059_0000000000000000"/>
and Readers. But however I shall shew two or three par∣ticular Ways, that are very pretty and amusing, and also very easy, both as to Cost and Pains. And</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If you dip your Pen in the Juice of a Lemon, or of an Onion, or in your own Urine, or in Spirits of Vitriol, and write on clean Paper whatever you intend, it <HI>shall</HI> not be discerned till you hold it to the Fire, and then it will ap∣pear legible. And if with any of the aforementioned, you write on your Skin, as on your Arm, the Back of your Hand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it shall not be seen <HI>till</HI> you burn a Piece of Pa∣per, and with the Ashes rub on the Place, and then it <HI>will</HI> appear very plain. And this I have experienced and try'd, and therefore can say, <HI>Probatum est.</HI></P>
<P>Another Way is, When you write a Letter that you in∣tend shall not be discovered, but to those you think fit; is first to write your Thoughts on one Side of your Letter with black Ink, as usual (but it ought to be on thin Paper) and then on the contrary Side, go over the said Matter that you would have secret, with a clean Pen dipp'd in Milk; and that Writing shall not be read without holding it to the Fire, as mentioned above, and then it <HI>will</HI> appear <HI>legible,</HI> in a bluish Colour.</P>
<P>A third Method, is to have two Pieces of Paper of equal Size, and the uppermost cut in chequered Holes or Squares, big enough to contain any Word of six or seven Syllables, and in these Squares write your Mind in regular Sense; and then take off the said chequered Paper, and fill up the Va∣cancies with Words of any Kind, which will render it per∣fect Nonsense, and not capable of being read, to any Pur∣pose of Intelligence. And transmit and send the said upper∣most, or chequered Paper, or another exactly of the same Form, to your Correspondent; whereby he shall, by laying it nicely on your said Letter, read your intended Sense, without being perplexed with the Words of Amusement in∣termixed, which makes it altogether unintelligible.</P>
<P>Or again, you may write to your Friend in proper Sense, with common Ink, and let the Lines be at so commodious a Distance, that what you intend to be secret, may be written between them with Water, wherein Galls have been steeped a little Time (but not long enough to tincture the Water) and when dry, nothing of the Writing between the said Lines ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be seen; but when it is to be read, you must, with a fine Hair Pencil, dipp'd in Copper as Water, go between the
<PB N="56" REF="007120_0060_0000000000000000"/>
said Lines, and so you make it legible. <HI>Note,</HI> This Way will give no Ground for Suspicion, because the Letter seemeth to carry a necessary Sense in those Lines that are set at such a proper Distance, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of ARITHMETICK.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Writing, the next necessary Step towards qualifying a Person for Business, is the Understanding that truly laudable and most excellent Accomplishment, the noble Science of <HI>Arithmetick</HI>; a Knowledge so necessary in all the Parts of Life and Business, that scarce any Thing is done without it.</P>
<P>In my Directions for its Attainment, I shall proceed with such Plainness of Method, and Familarity of Stile, as shall render it easy to be understood, and conspicuous to the meanest Capacity.</P>
<P>And first of <HI>Notation</HI> and <HI>Numeration.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Notation,</HI> we must note or observe that all Numbers are expressed by, or composed of, these ten Figures or Charac∣ters following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Cypher.</HI></P>
<P>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</P>
<P>Nine of these are called significant Figures, to distinguish them from the <HI>Cypher,</HI> which of itself signifies nothing; but as it is placed (in whole Numbers) serves to encrease the Va∣lue of the next Figure or Figures that stand before it; as 3 is but Three; but before the <HI>Cypher</HI> thus 30, the 3 becomes Thirty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in Decimal Fractions, the (0) decreases the Value of the Figure behind it; for therein, 3 is three Tenths of any Thing; but by placing 0 before it, thus, 03, it is decreased from 3 tenth Parts, to three hundredth Parts of any Thing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—We are to note, That every one, or any, of the abovementioned nine Figures, or Digits, have two Values; one certain, and another uncertain; the cer∣tain Value is, when it stands alone by itself; the uncertain is, when joined or placed with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Figures or Cyphers; for when any one of these Figures stands alone, they signify no more than their own simple Value; as 5 is but Five, 4 but Four, 6 but Six, and 3 no more than Three, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this is the certain Value of a Figure: But when another Fi∣gure or Cypher is annexed, they then are encreased in their
<PB N="57" REF="007120_0061_0000000000000000"/>
Value ten Times; as 5, or 5 Units, or Ones, to 5 Tens or Fifty, 4 to 4 Tens or Forty, 6 to 6 Tens or Sixty, and 3 to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tens or Thirty; as thus, 51, Fifty-one; 42, Forty-two; 63, Sixty-three; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4, Thirty-four, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Again, if any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he said Figures stand in the third Place towards the Left-hand, they signify so many Hundreds as they expressed Units or Ones; as 500 is Five Hundreds, 400 Four Hun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reds, 600 Six Hundreds, and 300 Three Hundreds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If any of them possess the 4th Place towards the Left-hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are so many Thousands as they contain Units. And so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny, or every Figure, encreases by a Ten-fold Proportion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Right-hand to the Left, according to the Place it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found or stands in; so that 5 may be but Five, or Fifty; Five Hundred, or Five Thousand. In the first Place, 5; in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he second 50; in the third 500; in the fourth Place 5000, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore, this is the uncertain Value of a Figure. But the true Value of Figures in Conjunction, may be fully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earnt and understood by the following Table.</P>

<P>Note always to place the lesser Number under the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (with the same Care and Order as in <HI>Addition</HI>) so the Unit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may stand under Units, Tens under Tens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Re∣mainder under the Line is the Difference sought: And such Difference being added again to the lesser Number, shall make the greater Number, and is a certain Proof of the said Rule.</P>

<HEAD>A general Rule.</HEAD>
<P>Whatever you used to stop at in <HI>Addition</HI> (whether of one Denomination or of several) the same you must borrow in <HI>Subtraction,</HI> when need requires: Remembering to pay, or carry 1 to the next Place towards the Left-hand. <HI>Example</HI>▪ Suppose Mr. <HI>Andrews</HI> owes to Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> whereof Mr. <HI>A.</HI> hath paid to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Sum of in part; what remains due to Mr. <HI>Baker?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="007120_0075_0000000000000000"/>Here the lesser Number 146, stands under the greater 323; and to find the Remainder or Sum resting due, I say, 6 from 3 I cannot; but 6 from 13 (for yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must always borrow 10 of the next Figure in the same under Line, and put it to the Figure or Cypher that stands directly over the Figure you substract) and there remains 7; then 1 that I borrow and 4 is 5, for as I borrowed 10 (or 1) out of 4, so I must pay the said 1 or 10 (for so it really is, because of the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple Pro∣portion of Increase from the Right-hand to the Left) to the said Figure 4 again, as above hinted: I say, 5 from 2 I cannot; but 5 from 12 (borrowing 10, and putting it to the over Figure 2, as above directed) and there remains 7; then 1 that I borrowed and 1 is 2, from 3 the over Figure, and there rests 1, and so the Example is done; and by it is shewn that <HI>A.</HI> still owes <HI>B.</HI> 177 Pounds as appears in the Work; and for Proof of its Verity, add 177 the Remainder, to 146 the lesser of the two given Numbers, and it will make 323, being the same with the greater Number, or Sum of Money first due; and therefore, a sure Proof of the Truth and Cer∣tainty of the Rule.

<P N="1">1.

<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>These foregoing Examples are Great Names to be brought into Small (as may easily be observed and understood;) there∣fore, as the first Rule directeth, it is done by Multiplication, by multiplying the greater Name by the Number of the next lesser Name that makes one of the said greater; as in the last Examples the lesser Name to Pounds is Shillings▪
<PB N="108" REF="007120_0112_0000000000000000"/>
wherefore I multiply by 20, because 20 of that lesser Name makes one of the said greater Name, <HI>i. e.</HI> 20 Shillings make a Pound. And the same Regard is had, and Method ob∣served in the Example of Weight; as is very plain to be seen in the Work, and is called <HI>Reduction Descending,</HI> because it brings Higher or Greater Denominations into Lower or Lesser.</P>
<P><HI>Example</HI> 3.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>In the first Way, I divide the Farthings by 4, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 4 of them make a Penny, and the Quotient is Pence; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Pence I divide by 12, because 12 of them make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shilling, and that Quotient is Shillings; which Shillings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divide by 20, to bring it into Pounds, thus▪ I▪ cut off the Cypher in the Dividend towards the Right, for the Cyphe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is in the Divisor 20, which is also separated from 2 with a Dash of the Pen, ( as may be seen in the Work) the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I halve the Figures one by one, as they are united with the Remainder in the Dividend; which Half is Pounds, and is a short Way of dividing by 20; in the Example I say, the Half of 10 (because I must not set down 0 at the Beginning is 5, and the Half of 3 is 1, and there remains 1; which makes the next, which is 0, 10; and the half of 10 is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> So that 10300 Shillings makes 515 Pounds, or there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many Pounds in 494400 Farthings</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> In dividing by 20, as above, if any Thing re∣mains it must be joined or annexed to the Figure or Cypher cut off; as suppose there had in halving the last Figure ex∣cepting that you cut off, remained 1, which there doth ne∣ver more, and then neither, but when the Figure halve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; I say, if there had remained 1, then it must have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to the Cypher separated or cut off, and then there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have been 10 Shillings.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>In the first of the two foregoing Examples I divide the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds by 28 to bring them into Quarters; then I divide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose Quarters by 4, to bring them into Hundreds Weight, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Work.</P>
<P>In the second Way, I divide the Pounds Weight by 112, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pounds in a C. Weight, and it brings the Pounds Weight into Hundreds Weight at once.</P>
<P>The said Examples are of small Denominations to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought into greater; and therefore according to the se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond Rule of Direction, it is done by Division, by dividing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lesser Name by as many of them as make the next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reater Name; that is, by 28, because 28 of them make one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the next greater Name, <HI>viz.</HI> a Quarter of a Hundred; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd this Reduction is called <HI>Reduction Ascending,</HI> because it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rings low or small Names to higher or greater Denominati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns.—By which may be observed, that all Questions in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eduction, whether Ascending or Descending, are answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither by Multiplication or Division, or by both; as will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lainly appear in the sundry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amples of Reducing of divers Denominations to others.</P>

So likewise when you multiply the Shillings by 12, if there be any Pence in the Place of Pence, you must also take them in.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The GOLDEN RULE: Or <HI>RULE</HI> of <HI>THREE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is called the <HI>Golden Rule</HI> from its excellent Perform∣ances in <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> as in other Parts also of <HI>Mathemical</HI> Learning.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Rule of Three,</HI> because from three Numbers given, proposed, or known, we find out a fourth Number required, or unknown, which bears such Proportion to the third at the second doth to the first Number. From whence also it is called, <HI>The Rule of Proportion.</HI></P>
<P>And of this <HI>Proportion</HI> there are two sorts; one calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Direct,</HI> and the other <HI>Indirect</HI> or <HI>Reverse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Direct Proportion</HI> is, when the second and third Numbers are multiplied together, and their Product is divided by the first.</P>
<P><HI>Indirect</HI> or <HI>Reverse Proportion</HI> is, when the first and se∣cond Numbers are multiplied together, and their Product is divided by the first.</P>
<P>In <HI>Direct Proportion,</HI> the fourth Number, or Answer to the Question, contains the third Number as often (or as ma∣ny times) as the second contains the first.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Indirect Proportion,</HI> the greater the third Number is, the less is the fourth; and the lesser the third Number is, the greater is the fourth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Stating the Question.</HEAD>
<P>The chiefest Difficulty that occurs in the <HI>Rule of Three,</HI> is the right placing the Numbers, or s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting the Question; for when that is done, you have nothing more to do, but to multiply and divide, and the Work is done.</P>
<P>And to this End, we are to remember, that of the three given Numbers, two of them are always of one Name or Denomination; and the other Number is ever of the same Name with the fourth Number or Answer required; and must always be the second or middle Number; and the Num∣ber that asketh the Question, must still possess the third or last Place; and the other Number of the same Name with the third, must be the first Number; for, the first and third Numbers must always be of one Name, <HI>viz.</HI> both Money▪

both Weight, both Time, or both Measure. And though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey be of one Kind, yet if one of them is altered, by <HI>Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uction,</HI> from a high to a lower Name, then the other must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reduced to the same Name. For you must particularly note, <HI>That if either the first or third Numbers consist of se∣veral Denominations, that is of Pounds and Shillings; or Pounds, Shillings, and Pence; or of Pounds, Shillings, Pence, and Farthings; or of Tons, Hundreds, Quarters and Pounds,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>then must they be reduced to the lowest Name mentioned. And if one happen to be of divers Denominations, and the other but of one Name; then the Number of one Name must be reduced as low, or into the same Name with the other; as sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose the first Number is brought into Farthings, then the third Number, though but Pounds, must be brought into Farthings also. Then you are to multiply the second and third Numbers together (when the Proportion is Direct) and divide the Pro∣duct by the first Number, and the Quotient thence arising will be the Answer to the Question, and in the same Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Middle Number: And if in a small D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nomination, it must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought by Division to the highest Name, for the better under∣standing the Answer.</HI> You must also Note, <HI>That if the mid∣dle Number be of several Denominations, it must be brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the lowest mentioned.</HI></P>

And since they both are not to be halved any longer; for though you can halve 14, yet you cannot 21, without Re∣mainder; try therefore to divide them by some other Digit Number, and you will find, that 7 will divide both Nume∣rator and Denominator without any Remainder; then say, the 7's in 14, twice; and the 7's in 21, three times: So is the Fraction 56/84 reduced into its lowest Terms, ⅔ two Thirds; and is the same in Value with 56/84, and done in this Form; <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>

<HEAD>Division of Decimals.</HEAD>
<P>IS the same in Operation as in whole Numbers. The onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Difficulty is to know how many Decimal Places to poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off towards the Left-hand of the Quotient; to which End, remember this Rule; Observe how many Decimal Places there are both in the Divisor and Dividend, and note the Difference; and whatsoever it is, so many Places must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pointed off to the Right-hand of the Quotient.</P>
<P><HI>Examples.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>In this Example, the Dividend hath three Decimal Places more than the Divisor, wherefore I point off three Places to the Right-hand of the Quotient, <HI>viz.</HI> 818; so the Quotient is 1 Integer, and ,818 Parts.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Here the Difference between the Divisor and Dividend is three Places; as in the foregoing Ex∣ample; therefore ,813 is pointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Decimal Fraction; and the Quotient is 2 Integers, and ,813 Thousandths of an In∣teger, or 1.</P>
<P>Thus much for Fractions Vulgar and Decimal; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have been as concise as possible, and worked with as mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Plainness as I could invent.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK-KEEPING.</HEAD>
<P>THE next Qualification to fit a Man for Business, af∣ter <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> is the Art of <HI>Book Keeping,</HI> or <HI>Mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hants Accompts,</HI> after the <HI>Italian</HI> Manner, by Way of Dou∣ble Entry.</P>
<P>It is not without good Reason that most People of Busi∣ness and Ingenuity, are desirous to be Masters of this Art; for if we consider the Satisfaction that naturally ariseth from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Account well kept; the Pleasure that accrues to a Person by seeing what he gains by each Species of Goods he deals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and his whole Profit by a Year's Trade; and thereby also to know the true State of his Affairs and Circumstances; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he may, according to Discretion, retrench or enlarge his Expences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as he shall think fit.</P>

<P>The short Lines ruled against the Journal Entries are, or may be, termed Posting Lines, and the Figure on Top of the Lines denotes the Folio of the Leidger where the Debtor is entered; and the Figure under the Line shews the Folio of the Leidger where the Credit is entered; and the other smaller Figures against the sundry Debtors, or sundry Creditors (whether Goods or Persons) shew also in what Folios of the Leidger they are posted. And the Figures in the narrow Column towards the Left-hand of the Pounds, Shillings, and Pence Lines, direct to the Folio in the Leidger where the Debit or Credit is posted, that is, to the
<PB N="159" REF="007120_0163_0000000000000000"/>
Accompt of Goods, or of the Person immediately following the Words <HI>To</HI> or <HI>By</HI>; the first being proper to the Left or Debit Side in the Leidger; and the other used always on the Right or Credit Side of the Folio's in the Leidger.</P>
<P>There are several other Books used by Merchants besides those three before-mentioned; as the <HI>Cash-Book,</HI> which is ruled as the Leidger, and folio'd likewise, wherein all Receipts of Money are entered on the Left-hand Folio, and Payments on the Right; specifying in every Entry the Day of the Month (the Year being set on the Top) for what, and for whose Account the Money was received, or paid; and the Total Debit or Credit of each Side is to be posted into the Leidger, to the Account of Cash therein, in one Line of either Side, <HI>viz.</HI> to or by sundry Accompts, as <HI>per</HI> Cash-Book, Folio, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is to be done once a Month, or at Discretion; and the Particulars of each Side, Article by Article, are to be posted into the Leidger to the proper Ac∣compts unto which they belong; with References in the Cash-Book to the several Folio's in the Leidger; and carry the Ballance over Leaf in the Cash Book; by which you may know at any time what Cash you have, or ought to have, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you.</P>
<P>Another Book, is a Book of Charges of Merchandize, wherein is to be entered the Custom and petty Charges of any shipp'd Goods; as Porterage, Wharfage, Warehouse room, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and once a Month is transferred into the Cash Book on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Credit Side, making Reference to the Book of Charges of Merchandize; and likewise the same in the Debtor Side <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the same Accompt in the Leidger for the Particulars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereof.</P>
<P>The next Book I shall name, is the Invoice Book, or Book of Factories: In this Book is to be copied all Invoices or Cargaisons of Goods shipped, either for Accompts pro∣per or partable; and also of Goods received from Abroad, which must always be entered on the Left-side, leaving the Right-side Blank; and on the Advice of the Disposal of Goods sent Abroad, and also on the Sale of Goods receiv'd from Abroad, enter them on the Blank or Right-side; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first View may be seen how the Accompt stands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next a Bill-Book, wherein is enter'd Bills of Ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hange accepted, and when they become due; and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, made so in the Margin.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="007120_0164_0000000000000000"/>The next is a Book of Houshold Expences, for the Monthly Charge spent in House-keeping; likewise Apparel, House-rent, Servants Wages, and Pocket Expences; and this may be monthly summed up, and carried to the Credit of Cash.</P>
<P>Besides the above mentioned, there must be a Book to copy all Letters sent Abroad, or beyond the Seas; wherein the Name of the Person or Persons to whom the Letter is sent, must be written pretty full, for the readier finding the same.</P>
<P>The next is (and what is very necessary) a Receipt Book, wherein is given Receipts for Money paid, and expressed for whose Accompt or Use, or for what it is received; to which the receiving Person must set his Name for himself, or some other, with the Year and Day of the Month on the Top.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> A note or Memorandum Book, to minute down Affairs that occur, for the better Help of Memory; and is of great Use where there is Multiplicity of Business.</P>
<P>Having given an Account of the several Books, and their Use, the next Thing necessary will be, to give some few Rules of Aid to enable the Book-keeper to make proper Entries; and to distinguish the several Debtors and Creditors, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> For Money received make Cash Dr. to the Party that paid it (if for his own Account) and the Party Cr.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Money paid make the Receiver Dr. (if for his own Accompt) and Cash Cr.</P>

</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How to balance at the Year's End, and thereby to know the State of your Affairs and Circumstances.</HEAD>
<P>YOU must make Accompt of Balance on the next void Leaf or Folio of your Leidger to your other Accompts; but after so done, do not venture to draw out the Accompt of Balance in the said Folio, till you have made it exact on a Sheet of Paper, ruled and titled for that Purpose; because of Mistakes or Errors that may occur or happen in the Course of balancing your Leidger; which are to be rectified, and will cause Erasements or Alterations in that Accompt, which ought to be very fair and exact; and after you have made it to bear in the said Sheet, copy fair the said Accompt or Balance in the Leidger.</P>
<P>The Rules for Balancing are these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> Even your Accompt of Cash, and bear the Nett Res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to balance Dr.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Cast up all your Goods bought, and those sold, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what kind soever, in each Accompt of Goods; and see whe∣ther all Goods bought, be sold or not; and if any remain unsold, value them as they cost you, or according to the present Market Price, ready Money; and bear the Nett Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to balance Dr.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> See what your Goods or Wares severally cost, and also how much they were sold for, and bear the Nett Gain or Loss to the Accompt of Profit and Loss.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Even all your Drs. and all your Crs. in order as they lie, and bear the Nett Rest of every Dr. and Cr. to Balance.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> Even your Voyages, your Factors Accompts, wherein is either Gain or Loss, and bear the Nett Gain or Loss to the Accompt of Profit and Loss, and the Goods un∣sold to Balance.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="163" REF="007120_0167_0000000000000000"/>6<HI>thly,</HI> Even the Accompt of Profit and Loss, and bear the Nett Rest to Stock or Capital, as an Advance to your Stock or Capital.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly,</HI> Even your Stock, and bear the Nett Rest to ba∣lance Cr.</P>
<P>Then cast up the Dr. and Cr. Sides of your Balance; and if they come out both alike, then are your Accompts well kept; otherwise you must find out your Error by pricking over your Books again, to see whether you have entered every Dr. and Cr. in the Leidger as you ought.</P>
<P>Note, <HI>By pricking over the Book is meant, an Examining every Article of the Journal, against the Leidger, and mark∣ing it thus,—or thus †; and upon the second Examination thus ‡ and upon a third Examination thus ‖; or any other Mark.</HI></P>
<P>Note also, <HI>in all Accompts of Goods, you must keep a Co∣lumn in the Middle of the Leaf, of each Side, for Number, Weight or Measure.</HI></P>
<P>And also Note, <HI>That the Money, Wares, or Goods remain∣ing in your Hands, and the Debts owing to you, must ever ba∣lance with the Nett Stock and Debts owing by you.</HI></P>
<P>Though all that hath been said in relation to Book-keep∣ing, and the several Rules thereunto belonging, may seem a little abstruse to the altogether Unlearned therein, yet there is no such mighty Difficulty to instruct them as they may ima∣gine▪ for these following Hints may render what hath been already said intelligible to an ordinary Capacity.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> Stick close to the Text, or general Rule beforemen∣tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Things received, or the Receiver, are Debtor to all Things delivered, or the Deliverer; for this Rule holds good in all Cases.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> When the Dr. (whether Person or Goods) is known, the Cr. is easily understood, without mentioning it: For if <HI>A</HI> be Dr. to <HI>B,</HI> then <HI>B</HI> is Cr. by <HI>A,</HI> for what Sum soever it be; also, if Goods be Dr. to <HI>C.</HI> then <HI>C</HI> is Cr. by those Goods for the Sum they amount to—This I mention, because that most Authors (if not all) that I have met with on the Subject of Book-keeping, spend a great many Words, which I think (begging their Pardon if I err) might be saved, in declaring the Creditor, as well as shewing the Debtor, when it may be understood, as aforesaid.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> This Art of <HI>Italian</HI> Book-keeping, is called <HI>Book-keeping by double Entry,</HI> because there must be two Entries;
<PB N="164" REF="007120_0168_0000000000000000"/>
the first being a Charging of a Person, Money, or Goods; and the second a Discharging of a Person, Money or Goods.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly, Strictly note,</HI> That if the first Entry be on the Dr. or Left-hand Side of your Leidger; the next or second Entry, must always be made on the Right or Credit Side of your Leidger; for when ever one Person or Thing is charged, then always another Person or Thing is discharged for the Sum, let it be what it will.</P>
<P>And so it is on balancing or evening an Accompt, and car∣rying it to another Folio; for if the old Accompt be evened by Balance on the Credit Side, then the new Accompt must be debited or charged on the Debit Side, for the Sum that balanced the old Accompt.</P>
<P>Much more might be said to this <HI>Art of Book-keeping,</HI> if I had Room; but I have plainly spoke to the principal Fun∣damentals thereof, which I hope may be sufficient for the Instruction and Improvement of any intelligent Reader.</P>
<P>The next Matter I shall go upon, is to shew, or give Ex∣amples of various Kinds of Receipts and promissory Notes; also Bills of Parcels in different Trades; likewise Bills of Book-Debts, Bills of Exchange, with Remarks on them; and some other Precedents of Writings in Trade and mer∣cantile Affairs▪</P>

<P><HI>And the easy Rule is this,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>Multiply the given Number by the Shillings in the Price, (if the Price be at so many Shillings <HI>per</HI> M) and always cut off three Figures or Places towards the Right hand; and the Figures towards the Left-hand are Shillings, which divide by 20, to bring them into Pounds; and those Figures separated towards the Right-hand, multiply by 12, the next inferior Denomination; and still cut off, or separate three Places to∣wards the Right-hand, and the Figures toward the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st are Pence; and the three last Figures cut off, multiply by 4; and still separate three Places toward the Right-hand, and the Figures toward the Left are Farthings.—And if the Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e be Shillings and Pence <HI>per</HI> Thousand, then reduce the Price into Pence, and multiply the given Number by the Pence contained in the Price, cutting off three Places toward the Right as aforesaid, and the Figures toward the Left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Pence, which bring into Pounds, according to Rule; and multiply the Remainder, or Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures cut off by 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Endorsing.</HEAD>
<P>IT frequently happens, that between the Acceptance of a Bill, and the Time of Payment, the Party to whom it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s first made payable, hath Occasion to pay it away; if so, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rites his Name on the back of the Bill, which is his Order, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as said before) and gives it to the Person he is indebted to, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd then he is impowered to receive the Money: And it may be, the second Person also wants to pay it away; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen he writes his Name likewise under the other, and de∣livers

it to a third Person to receive the Money; and it may be, the third does the same, and delivers it to a fourth Person, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All that do so are Endorsers; and he that last hath the Bill, if the Acceptor will not pay it, may sue him, or the Endorsers, or Drawer, or any of them, for the Money.</P>
<P>An Endorsement is generally in these Words, <HI>viz. Pay the Contents of the within mentioned Bill to</HI> Henry Hasty,</P>
<P><HI>George Greedy.</HI></P>
<P>But many times the Name only is accounted sufficient.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Protesting.</HEAD>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Superficial Measure.</HEAD>
<P>TO measure Things that have Length, and Breadth, such as Board, Glass, Pavement, Wainscoat, and Land, is to take the Dimensions of the Length and Breadth, according to the customary Method used in each Particular; as Board and Glass are measured by the Foot, but the Dimensions are taken in Feet and Inches, and the Content given in Feet.</P>
<P>Wainscoat and Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing by the Yard, as are also Plaistering and Paint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, and the Dimensions are taken in Feet and Inches, and the Content given in Yards.</P>
<P>Dimensions of Land are taken by the Pole or Chain, of 4 Poles in Length; all which is taken in square Measure super∣ficial, that is, an Inch, Foot, Yard, or Pole; which is not only sometimes in Length, but also as much in Breadth too; or if it wants of it one Way, it must be made up the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Square.</HEAD>
<P>The squaring of any Number, is multiplying it into itself, as 12 Inches multiplied by 12 Inches, make 144 Inches square, on the Flat. The Square of any Thing is found four several Ways, <HI>viz.</HI> by whole Numbers, by Decimals, by Practice, and by Cross Multiplication; in each of which Me∣thods I shall give Examples of Operation.</P>
<P>When any Thing is to be measured, it must be considered what Form or Fashion it is of: and then it must be measured according to the several Rules for each Figure.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If it be a Square of equal or unequal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides, that is, one Way longer or wider than the other (as Boards are almost always much longer than they are broad) then the Length and Breadth must be multiplied one by the other, which makes it square Measure, as was hinted before; and if that Product be divided by its proper Divisor, as 144 is the Di∣visor, for flat or superficial Measure, and 1728 the Divisor for cube or solid Measure; the first being the square Inches in a superficial square Foot, and the other the cubick square Inches in a solid Foot square.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Admit a Board be 12 Inches broad, and 8 Feet, or 96 Inches long, how many square superficial Feet doth it contain?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="007120_0194_0000000000000000"/><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Here the Length in Inches is multiplied by the Breadth in Inches, and the Product 1152 divided by 144, the square I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches in a Foot, quotes 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet square for the Contents of the Board.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A General Rule for Dispatch.</HEAD>
<P>If the Length of a Board, or Piece of Glass, be given in Fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Breadth in Inches, multiply one by the other (without any Reduction) and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vide the Product by 12, and the Quotient will be the Answer in Feet, and the Re∣mainder w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be Parts of a Foot. So the foregoing Example might have been sooner done by dividing 96 the Length, by 12 the Breadth, and it quotes 8 Feet for the Content, as by the former Way.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose a Board be 14 Feet long, and 15 Inches broad, what's the Content in square Feet?</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>So the Answer is 17 Feet and ½. And so for any other Example of this Kind.</P>
<P>Here 3 Inches is the of 2 Foot, wherefore ¼ of 14 is taken, and added to 14, and it makes 17 Feet and 2/4, equal to ½.</P>
<P>If a Board be wider at one End than the other, then take the Breadth in the Middle, or add the Measure of both Ends
<PB N="191" REF="007120_0195_0000000000000000"/>
together, and take the Half for the mean Breadth, which multiply by the Length.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose a Board to be 120 Inches long, and the narrowest End 10 Inches wide, and the broadest End 24 Inches wide; what is its Content in superficial Feet?</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>If a Board or Piece of Glass be ever so irregular, it may be measured very near, by taking the Breadth in 5 or 6 Places, and add the several Breadths together, dividing the Total by the Number of Places, and the Quotient will be the mean Breadth; which multiply by the Length, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Having the Breadth in Inches of any Board, or Piece of Glass, to know how much in Length of that Board or Piece of Glass, will make a Foot Superficial.</P>

<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>If a Board be 9 Inches broad, what Length of that Board will make a superficial Foot?</P>
<P><HI>Or by the Rule of Three Reverse, thus,</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>If a Board be 12 Feet ½ long, and 15 Inches broad, ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many square Feet doth it contain?</P>

<P><PB N="193" REF="007120_0197_0000000000000000"/><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Here the Content is found four several Ways, <HI>viz.</HI> by multiplying the Inches together, and divi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing by 144, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The next Work is performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecimally; the third Method is by cross Multiplication; and the last and best is by Practice.</P>
<P>Any of these Methods may be easily understood by the Use of the Arithmetical Part of this Book, except the Method by Cross Multiplication, which, I think, hath not been shewn; wherefore I shall explain it here.</P>
<P>In the Example, 1 Foot 3, stands under 12 Feet 6; and having drawn a Line, say, once 12 is 12; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n I say Cross∣way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> times 1 is 6 Inches; so that Line is 0 Feet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inches; Then Cross ways again, I say 3 times 12 is 36 I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches, the 12's in 36 is 3 times, or 3 Feet; so that Line is 3 Feet 0 Inches: Lastly, I multiply the Inches together, saying, 3 times 6 is 18, the 12's in 18 once, and there remains 6, or 6/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, equal to ½, as in the Work.</P>

<P>This Method is manifestly true, from this Observation; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Board a Foot, or 12 Inches broad, will require a Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 12 Inches in Length, to make it exactly square, or 14 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ches.

<P>So if a Piece be 10 Inches square, the Answer will be, that
<PB N="220" REF="007120_0224_0000000000000000"/>
17 Inches and 28/100 of an Inch is required for the Length. And thus may a Table of square Timber be proved.</P>
<P>In measuring of round Timber, the common Way is to take ¼ of the Circumference for the true Square, but it is erroneous, and gives the Solidity some what less than the true Content: But the true Way is to multiply half the Dia∣meter by half the Compass, and then that Product multiply by the Length, which divide by 1728, and the Quotient is the Content. If you cannot come to measure the End of the Piece, you may know the Dia∣meter <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> by this Proportion, <HI>viz.</HI> as 22 is to 7, so is the Compass to the Diameter. Or you may find the Square of a round Piece of Timber by this Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> multiply 3182 by the Inches of the Compass, and cut off 4 Fi∣gures to the Right-hand.</P>
<P>Having the Breadth and Depth of a Piece of Timber <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stone, to know how much in Length of it will make a so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Foot; multiply one by the other, and let it be a Divisor to 1728, thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>And thus you may make a Table to serve all Breadths and Depths, by which much Labour may be saved in multiplyin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and dividing, and yet measure any Piece of Timber thereby very exactly.</P>
<P>The usual Way for tapering Timber, is by this Method, <HI>viz.</HI> take the Dimensions in the Middle, and multiply that by the Length; which, though somewhat false, yet, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done at several Lengths, as at every 5 or 6 Feet, it will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very near▪</P>

<P>THERE is a near Sort of Kindred or Affinity between the Art of Measuring of Timber, and that of Gauging or Measuring of Liquors; for both are performed by cube or solid Measure, and therefore not improper closely to follow one another: For as often as there are found 172<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> solid or cubick Inches in a Piece of Timber (of what form soever) so many solid Feet is it said to contain.

<P>Let the Board be of the best season'd, finest, clearest Oak, one, two or more Feet square, and about three Inches thick. Take two Boards, and get them planed on both Sides, and then laid in the Sun-shine, or near a moderate Fire 2 or 3 Days together; then plane them again, and fix them with good Joints; and fasten them in gluing with wooden Pegs, as I have seen Coopers fix their Pieces of Heading for their Casks; and when thus glued and dried, plane them again, and then fasten them, by nailing two small Plates of Iron or Tin on the Back. If you cannot get season'd Wood, but green, then boil it about an Hour in Water, to make it tough, and keep it from warping. In the general, Wood is accounted better than Stone, because it keeps the Colouring more stanch or firm.</P>
<P>Before you colour your Dial-plate or Board, fix your Iron Stile, and having marked your Hour-lines with Ink, and fastened a Nail at the End of each Hour-line, that the Head of each Nail may shadow or direct you to the Center when it is coloured; and as it may happen that Golden Let∣ters or Figures may decay in a few Years, you may on that Account make them with White-lead Paint, pointed with Red in a Black Margin.—When your Dial is finished, and dry, dip a Feather in your Oil, and anoint it thinly; for the finer you mix or grind the Colouring with the Oil, the more beautiful it appears, though not so lasting.</P>

<HEAD>A short, but comprehensive Account of all Arts and Sciences.</HEAD>
<P>ALCHYMY, is that sublime Part of Chymistry, which teaches the Art of transmuting Metals, and making the Grand Elixir, or Philosopher's Stone, as some are weak enough to believe. But the best Definition of it is, that it is an Art without Art, which begins with Lying, is carried on with Labour, and ends with Beggary.</P>
<P>ALGEBRA, commonly called the Analytick Art, be∣cause it teaches how to resolve Questions, and demonstrate Theorems, by searching into the fundamental Nature and Frame of the Thing. It is the Science of Quantity in Ge∣neral, or a peculiar Method of Reasoning, which takes the Quantity sought, as if it were known, and then by the Help of another, or more Quantities given, proceeds by undeniable Consequences, till at length the Quantity first only supposed to be known, is found to be equal to some Quantity or Quantities certainly known.</P>
<P>ANATOMY, is that Art which teaches to dissect or take to Pieces any Animal Body, in a curious and dex∣terous Manner, in order to discover and explain the Origi∣nal, Nature and Use, of its several Part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for the Improve∣ment of Physick and natural Philosophy.</P>
<P>ARCHITECTURE, is the Art of erecting Edi∣fices proper for Habitation. The Antients have established five Orders of Architecture, called the <HI>Tuscan,</HI> the <HI>Dorick,</HI> the <HI>Ionick,</HI> the <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and the <HI>Composite,</HI> or <HI>Roma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Order, the Difference between which Orders consists in the

Column, with its <HI>Base</HI> and <HI>Capital,</HI> and the <HI>Entablature,</HI> that is, the <HI>Architrave, Frise</HI> and <HI>Cornice</HI>; for these are the Parts which constitute the Order, and each One hath its proper and peculiar Measures. The Rules of Architecture require <HI>Solidity, Convenience</HI> and <HI>Beauty, Solidity</HI> implies the Choice of a good Foundation, and good sound Materials to work with. <HI>Convenience</HI> consists in so ordering and disposing the Parts of an Edifice, that they may not hinder or em∣barrass one another. <HI>Beauty</HI> is that due ranging and agreea∣ble Union and Symmetry of all the Parts, which, upon the Whole, exhibits to the Eye of the Spectators a beauti∣ful Form and Appearance. Architecture may likewise be divided into <HI>Civil, Military</HI> and <HI>Naval. Civil Architec∣ture</HI> teaches to contrive and erect commodious Buildings for the Uses of Civil Life; such as Churches, Palaces and pri∣vate Houses. <HI>Military Architecture</HI> shews the best Way of raising Fortifications about Cities, Towns, Camps, Sea Ports, <HI>&amp;c. Naval Architecture</HI> is employed about the Building of Ships, Gallies, and other Vessels for the Water, together with Ports, Moles, Docks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on Shore.</P>
<P>ARITHMETICK, is the Art of numbering truly, and of finding all the Properties and Powers of Numbers.</P>
<P>ASTROLOGY, is that foolish Science which pretends to foretel future Events from the Motions of the heavenly Bodies, and their Aspects one to another▪ or from some imaginary, hidden Qualities, which the weak Admirers of this Cheat will have to be in the Stars.</P>
<P>ASTRONOMY, is a mathematical Science, which teaches us the Knowledge of the Stars or heavenly Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> Their Magnitudes, Distances, Motions and Eclipses.</P>
<P>BOOK-KEEPING, is the Art of keeping so distinctly all the Transactions of a Man's Business, that he may know at any Time the true State of his Affairs with Ease and Certainty.</P>
<P>BOTANY, as it relates to the Science of <HI>Medicine,</HI> teaches to discover and enumerate the several Virtues of Plants and Simples: As it relates also to <HI>Natural History,</HI> it teaches to distinguish the several Kinds and Species of Plants, Trees, Shrubs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one from another, and to give just Descriptions of them.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="007120_0302_0000000000000000"/>CHYMISTRY teaches how to separate the dif∣ferent Substances that are found in mixed Bodies, as Ani∣mals, Plants or Minerals, and to reduce them to their first Principles.</P>
<P>CHIROLOGY, the Art of dumb Language, or a Method of talking by Signs made with the Hands.</P>
<P>CHIRURGERY (or, as it is commonly written and pronounced, <HI>Surgery</HI>) is the third Branch of the cura∣tive Part of Medicine, and teaches how several Disease<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Accidents, incident to the Body of Man, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be cured by manual Operation. It is divided by some into five Parts. 1. <HI>Synthesis,</HI> a setting together Things that are se∣parated. 2. <HI>Diaeresi,</HI> a separa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Things that were before connected. 3. <HI>Diorthosis,</HI> a correcting of Things squeez∣ed together and contorted. 4. <HI>Exaeresis,</HI> the taking away of Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fluities. 5. <HI>Anaplerosis,</HI> the restoring of that which was deficient. It is a common Saying, that a good Surgeon should have an Eagle's Eye, a Lion's Heart, and a Lady's Hand.</P>
<P>CHRONOLOGY, is the Art of computing Time from the Creation of the World for historical Uses, and preserving an Account of remarkable Transactions, so as to date truly the Beginnings and the Ends of Reigns of Princes, the Revolutions of Kingdoms and Empires, signal Battles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>COSMOGRAPHY, teaches to describe the whole Frame of the Universe, with the several Parts thereof, ac∣cording to their Number, Positions, Motions, Magnitudes, Figures, &amp;c. The Sciences of Astronomy and Geography are comprehended in this.</P>
<P>DIALING, is the Art of drawing Lines on a gi∣ven Plane, in such a Manner as to shew the Hour of the Day when the Sun shines. <HI>Papyrius Cursor</HI> set up the first Sun-dial in <HI>Rome,</HI> about the Year of the City 447; and before that, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> there was no Account of Time, but the Sun's rising and setting.</P>
<P>ETHICKS, is the Science of Morality, by which we are taught the Rules and Measures of human Action; the Writers upon it usually divide it into two Parts: The first contains an Account of the Nature of moral Good and Evil: The other enumerates the several Virtues in which the Practice and Exercise of Morality consists, and which are the proper Means for us to obtain true Felicity, the End of all Moral Actions.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="007120_0303_0000000000000000"/>GEOGRAPHY, teaches to describe the whole Globe of the Earth, and all its Parts. It is usually divid∣ed into <HI>General</HI> and <HI>Particular.

<P>PHILOSOPHY, is the Knowledge or Study of Nature and Morality, founded on Reason and Experience. Philosophy owes its Name to the Modesty of <HI>Phythagoras,</HI> who refused the Title of <HI>Wise</HI> given to his Predecessors, and contented himself with the Appellation of a Friend, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lover of Wisdom.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Seven Wonders of the World.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Pagans</HI> did commonly boast of seven stately Structures, that were named, <HI>The Seven Wonders of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The greatest Wonder, and most incomparable Work, was the Temple of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> dedicated to <HI>Diana.</HI> It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst begun by <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> and seated (for Fear of Earth∣quakes) in marish Ground; it was 425 Feet long, and 220 Feet broad; it had in it 127 stately Marble Pillars, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch of which had been the sole Enterprize and Work of a King who was resolved to make his Piety and Magnificence appear upon his Pillar. It was 200 Years in building, though many Thousands of Men were employed in the Work; it was re-built at the Command of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> by <HI>Dinocrates,</HI> his Engineer.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Walls of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and the pleasant Gardens which Queen <HI>Semiramis</HI> planted; about this Work 300,000 Men were continually employed many Years. These Walls were 300, or 350 <HI>Stadia</HI> about, which make about 22 <HI>English</HI> Miles; they were 50 Cubits high, and so broad, that two or three Chariots might go upon them abreast, without any Danger.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Lybyrinth of <HI>Egypt,</HI> built by <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or <HI>Me∣nis,</HI> for his Tomb, in which 16 large Apartments, or sump∣tuous Palaces, were built, to equal the 16 Governments, or Provinces of <HI>Egypt</HI>; there were in it so many Ways and ar∣tificial Walks, that it was no easy Matter to find the Way out of it. <HI>Daedalus</HI> took his Model from this, to build his Labyrinth in <HI>Crete.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The Pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which remain to this Time; there were three of them; the greatest was built by <HI>Chem∣nis,</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as a stately Monument of his Power, and to be his Sepulchre after his Death: It was placed a∣bout 16 <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Memphis,</HI> or <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> and was about 1440 Feet in Height, about 143 Feet long on each Side of the square Basis, and 600,000 Men were employed in building it, during the Space of 20 Years. It is built of hard <HI>Arabian</HI> Stones, every one about 30 Feet long. <HI>Chemnis</HI> was torn in Pieces in a Mutiny of his People, and could never obtain the Honour of being interred in this Se∣pulchre. <HI>Cephus,</HI> his Brother, succeeded him, and imitated his vain glorious Actions, in erecting another less than the
<PB N="304" REF="007120_0308_0000000000000000"/>
former. The last was built by King <HI>Mycerinus,</HI> or (as som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say) by the famous Strumpet <HI>Rhodope</HI>; upon this appears a great Head of black Marble, of 102 Feet round about the Temples, and about 60 Feet high from the Chin to the Crown of the Head.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Mausolaeum of <HI>Caria,</HI> which Queen <HI>Artemisia</HI> built, as a Sepulchre for her deceased Husband <HI>Mausolus</HI>; she enriched it with so many rare Ornaments, that it was esteemed one of the greatest Wonders of the World; and all Monuments of this Kind have since been called <HI>Mauso∣laea.</HI> This Queen did love her Husband so much, that besides this Edifice, which she erected for him, she caused the Ashes of his consumed Body to be put into a Cup of Wine, and drank it, to give him a Lodging next to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heart.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lossus</HI> of <HI>Rhodes</HI> was made by <HI>Chares,</HI> of <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Minor,</HI> of Brass, in the Space of 12 Years, and was dedi∣cated to the Sun. It cost about 44000 l. <HI>English</HI> Money, and was placed at the Entrance of the Harbour of the City, with the right Foot standing on one Side of the Land, and the Left on the other; between the Legs the tallest Ships, with their Masts, did enter into the Haven. When it fell to the Ground by an Earthquake, few Men were able to embrace the little Finger of this prodigious Statue. It was 800 Feet high, and of a proportionable Bigness; and when broken down and beat to Pieces by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> that took the Island, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 684, they loaded above 900 Camels with it.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The Statue of <HI>Jupiter Olympius</HI> was the neatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all these Works; it was erected by the <HI>Eleens,</HI> a People of <HI>Greece,</HI> and placed in a Temple dedicated to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was enriched afterwards with many curious Representations, and excellent Statues: This of <HI>Jupiter</HI> was sitting in a Chair half naked, but from the Girdle downwards he was covered; in the right Hand he held an Eagle, and in the Left a Scepter. <HI>Caligula</HI> endeavoured to transport it to <HI>Rome,</HI> but those that were employed about it were frighted from their Enterprize, by some unexpected Accident. This Statue was made by <HI>Phidias,</HI> and was 150 Cubits high; the Body was of Brass, but the Head was of pure Gold.</P>

<P>To these may be added, the Royal Palace of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> King of <HI>Media,</HI> built in a very grand and extravagant Manner, by <HI>Menon,</HI> who cemented the Stones with Gold; also the Temple built at <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Minerva,</HI> and another in the same City to <HI>Mars,</HI> where the Judges met to examine Causes of Life and Death; with the glorious Temple, or Fabrick, at <HI>Delphos,</HI> where <HI>Apollo</HI> gave Oracles.

<P>THE <HI>Muses</HI> had several Names given them by the antient Poets, according to the several Places where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey dwelt; sometimes they were called <HI>Pierides,</HI> on ac∣count of the Forest <HI>Pieris,</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> where they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to be born; sometimes <HI>Heliconiades,</HI> from Mount <HI>Heli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,</HI> which was near their beloved <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other Names, according to the Pleasure of the Mytho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogists, in their fabulous Accounts of the Heathen Deities.</P>

<P>They were represented as <HI>Women,</HI> because <HI>Disciplines</HI> and <HI>Virtues</HI> have feminine Names assigned to them; they were painted young, handsome and modest; agreeably dressed and crowned with Flowers; they were much esteemed fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Chastity, and it is written of them, that when <HI>Adonis</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Favourite of <HI>Venus,</HI> offered to stir up in them some In∣clinations to Love, they fell upon him▪ and killed him.</P>

<P>His Father is said to be <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and his Mother <HI>Alcmena</HI>; when his Mother was big with Child with him, <HI>Sthelenus,</HI> King of <HI>Mycene,</HI> was in great Hopes of obtaining speedily a Son, afterwards named <HI>Eurystheus. Jupiter</HI> took an Oath, that he that should be born first, should be King, and have an absolute Command over the other; which when <HI>Jun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (Jupiter</HI>'s Wife, the sworn Enemy of all her Husband's Concubines, and of all the Children that were born of them) had accidentally heard, she caused <HI>Eurystheus</HI> to come forth of his Mother's Womb, at the End of seven Months, and by that Means procured unto him the Scepter with the Sovereign Command.</P>
<P>'Tis said that when <HI>Jupiter</HI> lay with <HI>Hercules</HI>'s Mother, he spent three Nights (which he caused to be joined toge∣ther) in begetting him; his Body and Stature were an∣swerable to the Pains and Power of his Father, for he was seven Feet high, had three Ranks of Teeth in his Mouth, and out of his Eyes Sparkles of Fire and Light did some∣times proceed.</P>
<P><HI>Juno,</HI> at the Intercession of <HI>Pallas,</HI> seemed to be recon∣ciled to <HI>Hercules</HI>; as a Testimony of her Good-will to him, when in his Infancy, she gave s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck to him of her own
<PB N="309" REF="007120_0313_0000000000000000"/>
Breast; by that Means it happened, that the little <HI>Hercules,</HI> having spilt some of the Milk out of his Mouth, he whited that Part of the Sky that is called the Milky Way. This Kindness was only feigned to satisfy the Request of <HI>Pallas</HI>; for a while after, when he was yet in his Cradle, she sent two dreadful Serpents to devour him, which did not how∣ever answer her Expectation; for the Child, without any Show of Fear, caught them in his Hands, and tore them in Pieces.</P>
<P>When he came to Years of Understanding, he was put under the Tuition of such Masters as did excel in many Arts and Sciences, to learn of them the Things that were required to make him accomplished He was taught by <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a <HI>Scythian,</HI> to handle the Spear and Dart; <HI>Lu∣cius,</HI> the Son of <HI>Apollo,</HI> taught him the Rudiments of Learn∣ing, and because he had chastised him with a Rod, <HI>Hercules</HI> killed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen he came to be of Age; from <HI>Eumolpus</HI> he learned the Art of playing upon Instruments of Musick; <HI>Chiron</HI> ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him an Insight into Astrology, and <HI>Harpolicus</HI> made him understand the other Sciences that were necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accomplish a Man of his Birth and Valour.</P>
<P>He was scarce eighteen Years of Age, when <HI>Eurystheus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged him in the most difficult Enterprizes, and exposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to all Manner of Dangers to make him perish; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he took a Resolution to obey him no longer; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> informed him, that it was the Will of the Gods, that he should pass twelve Times more through Dangers, in Obedience to the Commands of this Tyrant. These are named the twelve Adventures or Labours of <HI>Hercules.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. He was appointed to destroy a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the Forest of <HI>Nemea,</HI> that was fallen from the Moon, and spoiled the Country round about; he discharged all his Arrows at this wild Beast to little Purpose, and then encountered it with his Club only in his Hand, but the Skin was so tough and hard that no Weapon could enter it, which when <HI>Hercules</HI> perceived, he caught hold of the raging Lion, and tore him in Pieces with his Hands. Ever after he delighted in wearing the Skin of this Lion about him, as a Token of his Victory, and in Imitation of him all Heroes have Skins of Lions, or other wild Beasts upon their Bucklers; and some say, this is the Lion that was placed among the twelve Signs of the <HI>Zodiack.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="310" REF="007120_0314_0000000000000000"/>2. He was sent to the Lake of <HI>Lerna,</HI> near <HI>Argos,</HI> to encounter with an Hydra, a notable Serpent, or Dragon of a strange Nature; for it had seven Heads, and when one was cut off, many others did immediately burst forth, so that it was not possible to overcome this Monster, unless all his Heads were cut off at one Time, and the rest of his Body destroy∣ed by Fire and Sword, which was executed by <HI>Hercules.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Eurystheus</HI> sent him to Mount <HI>Erymanthus,</HI> in <HI>Arcadia,</HI> where a wild Boar of extraordinary Bigness destroyed all the neighbouring Fields: <HI>Hercules</HI> dragged him alive to <HI>Eurystheus,</HI> who was almost frighted out of his Wits when he beheld him.</P>
<P N="4">4. He got hold of the Stag of the Mountain <HI>Menelaus,</HI> whose Feet were of Brass, and Horns of Gold, when he had pursued it a whole Year.</P>
<P N="5">5. He put to Flight the Birds of the Lake <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lus,</HI> that were so numerous, and of such a prodigious Greatness, that they darkened the Air, and hindred the Sun from shining upon Men, when they flew over them; besides they did often take up some, and carry them away to de∣vour them. But these Encounters were not worthy to be compared with his Combat against,</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Amazons,</HI> who were Women of <HI>Scythia,</HI> dwell∣ing upon the Coasts of the <HI>Hircanian Sea,</HI> who having fol∣lowed their Husbands in the War, and seeing them all cut off by the Enemy, near the River <HI>Thermodon,</HI> in <HI>Cappado∣cia,</HI> they resolved to maintain the War themselves, and not to suffer any Man to have Command in the Army, or Kingdom, or to live among them. They went among their Neighbours to fetch from them Children; the Males they destroyed, but kept the Females, and brought them up in a warlike Manner; and that they might be more ready to handle the Bow and Arrows, they burnt their right Paps in their Infancy. They behaved gallantly in the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Penthesilea</HI>; but were forced to yield to the Valour of <HI>Hercules,</HI> who being accompanied by <HI>Theseus,</HI> went against them, according to the Command of <HI>Eurystheus,</HI> and took their Queen <HI>Hippolite,</HI> who was af∣terwards married to <HI>Theseus.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. He undertook to cleanse the Stables of <HI>Auge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> King of <HI>Elis,</HI> in which Thousands of Oxen had been daily fed, so that the Dung, by a long Continuance, was much in∣creased, and filled the Air with Infection; <HI>Hercules</HI> there∣fore
<PB N="311" REF="007120_0315_0000000000000000"/>
turned the Current of the River <HI>Alpheus</HI> from its ordi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary Course, and caused it to pass through the Stables; thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carried away the Filth in one Day, according to his Bargain; but <HI>Augeas</HI> was not grateful to him for his Pains▪ for he denied him the tenth Part of the Oxen that were kept there; this caused the Death of <HI>Augeas,</HI> and the Loss of his Goods.</P>
<P N="8">8. He seized upon a Bull, that did breathe nothing but Fire and Flame, which <HI>Neptune</HI> had sent into <HI>Greece,</HI> to punish some Disgraces and Affronts, which he had received from that Country.</P>
<P N="9">9. He passed into <HI>Thracia,</HI> where he caused the Tyrant <HI>Diomedes</HI> to endure in his own Person, that which he made others to suffer, which was, he gave all Strangers that he could catch in his Kingdom to be devoured by his Horses. <HI>Hercules</HI> served <HI>Busiris</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the same Manner, because he was so cruel to all Strangers, as to cut their Throats upon the Altars of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that he might cloke his Cruelty by a Pretence of Piety.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Geryon,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was reported to have three Bodies, because he commanded three Kingdoms, was no less cruel than the former; he fed some Oxen, which he highly esteemed, as <HI>Diomedes</HI> did his Horses, and to keep them, he had a Dog with three Heads, and a Dragon with Seven. When <HI>Hercules</HI> was sent thither by <HI>Eurystheus,</HI> he treated him as he had formerly done <HI>Diomedes.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. He was required to put into the Possession of <HI>Eury∣stheus,</HI> certain Golden Apples belonging to <HI>Juno,</HI> that were in the Custody of some Nymphs, the <HI>Hesperides,</HI> Daughters of <HI>Hesperus,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Atlas</HI>; but before any one could come at them, a great Dragon that was at the En∣try of the Gardens where they grew, was to be first over∣come. He found Means to accomplish this Enterprize also; some say he made Use of <HI>Atlas,</HI> who went to gather them, while he took his Burden upon him, and bore up the Hea∣vens with his Shoulders.</P>
<P N="12">12. The last Injunction which he received from <HI>Eury∣stheus,</HI> was to fetch from Hell the Dog <HI>Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erus,</HI> from whence he brought also <HI>Theseus,</HI> that was gone down to keep Company with his dear Friend <HI>Pirathous.</HI></P>
<P>These glorious Actions made <HI>Hercules</HI> dreadful to <HI>Eury∣stheus,</HI> and to all Princes in the World. Afterwards there was no Tyrant, nor Monster known, but he undertook to
<PB N="312" REF="007120_0316_0000000000000000"/>
destroy them; thus he put to Death <HI>Cacus</HI> (the Son of <HI>Vul∣can,</HI> who had three Heads) because he was a notable Rob∣ber, who did spoil and destroy all that came near the Mount <HI>Aventin.</HI> From thence he went to Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> where he delivered <HI>Prometheus,</HI> and killed the Eagle that devoured his Liver. He had also an Encounter with <HI>Antaeus,</HI> the Son of the Earth, who was of a prodigious Bigness and did commit all Manner of Cruelties; <HI>Hercules</HI> lifted him up in his Arms, and pressed the Breath out of his Body.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Hercules</HI> was big, and of an high Stature, a small Matter was not sufficient to nourish him, for as he walked in the Fields, one Day when he was hungry, he met <HI>Theo∣damus</HI> tilling the Ground, he snatched from him one of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Oxen, which he laid upon his Shoulders, and devoured every Bit of it before <HI>Theodamus,</HI> who loaded him all the while with Curses and Imprecations.</P>
<P>He made a Journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> where he separated the two Mountains, <HI>Calpe</HI> and <HI>Abyla,</HI> to let the main Ocean in∣to the Land, by the Straits of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>; these two Moun∣tains situated one against another, <HI>Calpe</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Abyla</HI> in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> do appear afar off as two Pillars, they are said to be the two Pillars of <HI>Hercules,</HI> where he engraved these Words, <HI>Non plus ultra</HI>; as if these were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds of the World, beyond which he could not enlar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Do∣minions. In all his Conquests, he made Use of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of an Olive Tree, which at last he dedicated to <HI>Mercury,</HI> the God of Eloquence, whose Virtue he acknowledged to be more profitable than the Power of Arms.</P>
<P>To re-count all that the Antients have recorded of this famous Man, would make a pretty large Volume, and per∣haps not be so agreeable to some Persons as this Epitome▪ therefore we will just hint at the Catastrophe of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and conclude our Narrative.</P>
<P>Like the Heroes of old, he was enamour'd with Women; he married <HI>Megara,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> King of <HI>Thebes,</HI> whom he afterwards killed; then he became a Slave to <HI>Om∣phale,</HI> Queen of <HI>Lydia,</HI> for whom he changed his Club for spinning Instruments, and his Lion's Skin for the Garments of a waiting Maid. Afterwards he became amorous of <HI>De∣janira,</HI> for whom he was to fight <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>helous,</HI> the Son of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etys,</HI> whom he conquered; and returning with her to a River<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Side, where <HI>Nessus</HI> the <HI>Centaur</HI> offered his Service to carry her behind him to the other Side; when the Traitor
<PB N="313" REF="007120_0317_0000000000000000"/>
came over, he would have abused her, had not <HI>Hercules</HI> pierced▪ him with an Arrow to the Heart; when he was ready to expire, he resolved to revenge himself in this Man∣ner: He gave his Garment dropping with his Blood to <HI>Dejanira,</HI> persuading her, that if her Husband did wear it but once, he would never have Love for other Women. The silly Creature believes him, therefore she sent it to him by <HI>Lychas</HI> his Man, when he was sacrificing upon Mount <HI>Oeta</HI>; but it fell not out as she had imagined, for as soon as he had put on this Coat, the Blood of <HI>Nessus,</HI> which was a most powerful Poison, caused so great a Burning all over his Body, that in Despair he cast himself into a flaming Pile of Wood, and there was consumed to Ashes.</P>
<P>His Servant <HI>Lychas</HI> was drowned in the Sea, where he was changed into a Rock, and <HI>Dejanira,</HI> for Grief, killed herself, with a Blow of her Husband's Club.</P>
<P><HI>Hercules,</HI> before he died, obliged <HI>Philoctetes,</HI> the Son of <HI>Pean,</HI> his Companion and Friend, to swear unto him never to discover the Place where his Ashes and Bones were bu∣ried▪ he then delivered unto him his Arrows, colour'd with the Blood of the <HI>Hydra,</HI> which were afterwards car∣ried to the Siege of Troy.</P>

<P>But though King <HI>Charles</HI> was generally for ex∣tending the Royal Power beyond its legal Bounds, yet in his Reign several excellent Laws were made for the Security of the Subjects Liberties; particu∣larly, in his third Year the Petition of Rights was made into a Law, in which it is enacted, That no Subject shall be compelled to any Gift or Contribu∣tion to the King, but by Consent of Parliament: Soldiers are forbidden to be quartered in private Houses, and Martial Law is annulled.

By <HI>Approach.</HI> And 4. <HI>Whip-Graffing.</HI> Of each of these in order. 1. <HI>Graffing in the Cleft,</HI> or <HI>Slit Graffing.</HI> This is performed on the <HI>Pear, Cherry</HI> and <HI>Plumb Stocks.</HI> After you have chose your <HI>Stock,</HI> cut off the Head in a smooth Place, sloping; then e∣ven the Top horizontally with your Knife; this being done, make a Slit near two Inches deep down the Middle of the <HI>Stock,</HI> with a large strong Penknife; then prepare your Cy∣on (taken from a vigorous Shoot of the foregoing Year, which was prepared in <HI>January</HI>) sloping it on each Side, from a Bud or Eye, but leaving it thiner on that Side which goes into the Stock than on the Outside, so that it may conform itself to the Slit in the Stock; then place the Cyon in the Stock, and close the Bark of both exactly. After this is done, temper Clay and short Hay together, and putting it round the Stock and the lower Part of the Cyon, but so as not to disturb the Cyon, which must be left with more than three or four Eyes above the Stock. In case the Stock be large, you may put two Cyons in the Cleft; one on each Side. If the Stock be very large, use a Mallet and large Knife to make a Slit or Cleft. Let not your Cyons be loose nor pinched.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To graff in the Bark.</HI> This is only used for <HI>Apples</HI>; and you are to cut the Head of the Stock as in the former, and instead of slitting the Stock, slit only the Bark a little more than an Inch on the South-West Side, as long as the sloped Part of the Cyon; at the Top of the Slit loosen the Bark with your Knife, then with a smooth Instrument of Ivory or hard Wood cut sloping as the Cyon, make Room for the Cyon, by thrusting it down between the Bark and the Wood of the Stock, where it was slit; next take your Cyon (being prepared with a flat Slope about an Inch long, ending in a Point, and begun from the Back of an Eye) and put it into the Stock, thrusting the Top of the Slope as
<PB N="332" REF="007120_0336_0000000000000000"/>
low as the Top Surface of the Stock; then order the Bark on each Side the Cyon, that it may fall close to the Stock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then clay it over as before.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Graffing by Approach</HI> or <HI>Inarching.</HI> This is performed where the Stock grows so near another Tree whose Fruit you would propagate, that it may be joined with a Branch of that Tree, by cutting the Sides of the Branch and Stock about three Inches long, and so fitting them, that the Passages of the Sap may meet; in which Posture let them be bound and clayed. When they are cemented, cut off the Head of the Stock, about four Inches above the Binding, and in <HI>March</HI> following cut off the Stub that was left of the Stock, and then close the graffed Place, that it may subsist by the Stock only. This <HI>Graffing</HI> is also per∣formed by cutting off the Head of the Stock at first, slop∣ping it about two Inches long, and joining the Cyon thereto. This Manner of <HI>Graffing</HI> agrees best with <HI>Vines, Oranges, Pomegranates,</HI> and such like.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Whip Graffing.</HI> This is where the Stock and Cyon are of the same Bigness; the Stock must be sloped an Inch or more, and also the Cyon; and then one is tied upon the other; or else a Shoulder may be mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the Cyon, to suit with which, the Top of the Stock should be cut; then bind them together, and clay them.</P>

<P>When a Tree is planted, and has produced two well dis∣posed Branches, with some weak Ones intermixed, they are all to be shortened equally, to the Length of five or six Inches; and if the Position of the two Branches be irre∣gular, there must be only one left to begin the Formation of the Figure of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> It sometimes happens, that a Tree will shoot five, six, or seven Branches, the first Year, in which Case three or four only of the best Branches are to be preserved.

<P>The Manner of making it is thus; you must grind and press the Apples, and then take the Juice and boil it in a Copper till three Quarters of it is wasted, which will be done in about 6 Hours gently boiling, and by that Time it comes to be of the Sweetness and Consistency of Melasses.</P>
<P>Some of our People scum the Cyder as it boils, others do not, and yet there seems to be no great Difference in the Goodness.</P>
<P>This new Melasses answers all the Ends of that made of the sweet Cane imported from beyond Sea. It serves not only for Food and Brewing, but is of great Use also in preserving of Cyder; two Quarts of it put into a Barrel of rack'd Cyder, will both preserve, and give it a very agreea∣ble Colour.</P>
<P>The Apple Melasses was discovered a few Years since, by a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> in this Pro∣vince, a Town remote from the Sea, and where the <HI>West-India</HI> Melasses is dear and scarce; he ingenuously confesses the Discovery was purely accidental, but ever since he has supplied his Family with Melasses out of his Orchard, and his Neighbours also now do the like, to their great Advan∣tage.</P>
<P>Our Country Farmers run much upon planting Orchards with these Sort of Sweetings, for fattening their Swine, and assure me it makes the best Sort of Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. And I know

<HEAD>Every Man his own <HI>DOCTOR:</HI> Or the POOR PLANTER's PHYSICIAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>[Wrote by a Gentleman in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and first printed there]</BYLINE>
<P>THE most acceptable Service we can render to GOD is Beneficence to <HI>Man.</HI> There are three Ways of be∣nefiting our Fellow Creatures. We may be useful to their Souls by good Instruction, and good Example: We may be helpful to their Bodies, by feeding the Hungry, cloath∣ing the Naked, and prescribing easy Remedies to the Sick: We can aid them in their Fortunes, by encouraging of In∣dustry, by relieving the Distressed, and doing all the kind Offices we are able to our Neighbours. These are the several Ways of improving the Talents our Maker has entrusted us with; and we must every one expect hereafter to give an Account how we have employed them.</P>
<P>I wish it were in my Power to serve Mankind, more than I do, in each of these Particulars; but the gracious Acceptance of the Widow's Offering, encourages me also to cast in my Mite into the Treasury. I publish this Treatise to lead the poorer Sort into the <HI>pleasant Paths of Health</HI>; and when they have the Misfortune to be <HI>sick,</HI> to shew them the cheapest and easiest Ways of <HI>getting well</HI> again.</P>
<P>Our Country is unhappily subject to several very sharp Distempers. The Multitude of Marshes, Swamps, and great Waters, send forth so many Fogs, and Exhalations, that the Air is continually damp with them: This, in Spight of all our Precautions, is apt to shut up the Pores at once, and hinder insensible Perspiration. From hence pro∣ceed <HI>Fevers, Coughs, Quinsies, Pleurisies</HI> and <HI>Consumptions,</HI> with a dismal Train of other Diseases, which make as fa∣tal Havock here, in Proportion to our Number, as the <HI>Plague</HI> does in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of the World.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, this is a cruel Check to the Growth of an Infant Colony, which otherwise, by the Fruitfulness of our Women, and the great Number of Recruits sent from our Mother Country, would, in a few Years, grow populous, and consequently considerable.</P>
<P>It is impossible to see these Calamities return every Year, without the tenderest Commiseration. Certainly nothing
<PB N="345" REF="007120_0349_0000000000000000"/>
can be more melancholy, than to have so many poor Peo∣ple perish, purely for want of using timely Means for their Preservation. They neglect to take any Remedy till their Case is grown desperate, and Death begins to glare them in the Face. They consider not, that a moderate Skill may recover a Patient in the Beginning of a Distemper, while he has Strength to go thro' all the necessary Opera∣tions, when the whole <HI>College</HI> would not be able to save him, after his Spirits are sunk, and all the Principles of Life near extinguished.</P>
<P>This unhappy Temper occasions a great deal of Mortali∣ty: And what makes the Misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heaviest on the Younger Sort, who are most liable to hurrying Distempers. Indeed, some would be glad of As∣sistance, if they did not think the Remedy near as bad as the Disease: For our <HI>Doctors</HI> are commonly so exorbitant in their Fees, whether they kill or cure, that the Patient had rather trust to his Constitution, than run the Risque of beg∣garing his Family.</P>
<P>These Considerations made me account it a Work of great Charity and publick Spirit, to communicate to the poor Inhabitants of this Colony, a safe Method of curing themselves, when they shall be so unhappy as to fall into a∣ny of our common Maladies. And for their greater En∣couragement, the Remedies I shall prescribe, may be pro∣cured with little Trouble and Expence, being, for the most Part, such as grow at their own Doors, or may be easily propagated.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this well-meaning Essay has really no other View than the Love of Mankind, yet it could not escape being grossly attack'd by some <HI>Fysts</HI> of the Faculty. However like <HI>Aesop</HI>'s Viper, while they endeavour to make a venomous Impression on the File, they only broke their own Teeth. In the mean Time, whatever my Obligati∣ons may be to 'em for their <HI>Scurrility,</HI> the honest <HI>Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er</HI> has reason to thank them, because nothing contributes so certainly to the quick Sale of any Performance, as a stupid Answer to it.</P>
<P>Providence has been so good, as to furnish almost every Country with Medicines proper for the Distempers inci∣dent to the Climate; and such domestick Remedies are al∣ways sufficient for the Poor, who live upon homely Fare, and for the Temperate, who make a right Use of GOD's,
<PB N="346" REF="007120_0350_0000000000000000"/>
Blessings. Their Cases are seldom complicated, and pro∣ceed, for the most Part, from Cold, or some slight Trans∣gression. In such Ailments, the Symptoms cannot easily be mistaken, nor is the Cure difficult; all the <HI>Secret</HI> lies <HI>in taking the Distemper in Time</HI>: And this will be the more ne∣cessary, because most Diseases that happen from Cold, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exceedingly violent, and call aloud for speedy Assistance.</P>
<P>I must therefore conjure my dear Countryfolks to begin with themselves as soon as they can distinguish what Sick∣ness they have, while Nature is strong and able to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope∣rate with the Medicines they take. Nor can we hope, that Heaven will assist us in our Calamities, unless we endeavour, at the same time, to assist ourselves.</P>
<P>In setting down the following Prescriptions, I have been cautious of talking like an <HI>Apothecary</HI>; that is, of using hard Words, that perhaps neither my Patient, nor I myself understand. Nor have I taken them lightly upon Trust, but am able to recommend most of them upon more than Twenty Years Experience; and for the rest, I have credi∣ble Authority. In the mean time, I hope none will ob∣ject, like <HI>Naaman,</HI> the <HI>Syrian,</HI> to the Easiness of any of these Remedies; but rather rejoice, that they can have the greatest of all Blessings so very cheap. And in Truth, People must love Difficulty extremely, to slight Health, as they would a Mistress, for being gained with little Trouble.</P>
<P>That this <HI>Treatise</HI> may be as useful as possible, I have made some small Additions here and there in this Edition, but so as neither to swell the Book, or enhance the Price. And as the whole is design'd for those who can't afford to die by the Hand of a <HI>Doctor,</HI> I hope the Legitimate Sons of <HI>Esculapius</HI> will be the more merciful. But as for the spu∣rious Breed, they have no Right to find Fault with what they can't mend, and it will be prudent to make a Secret of their own Ignorance.</P>
<P>Before I mention the Cure, I shall endeavour to describe the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of each Distemper, in so plain a Manner, that any Person may be Master of his own Case, if he will but attend carefully to what he feels; otherwise he might mi∣stake his Illness, and apply an improper Remedy. I shall also recommend the <HI>Diet</HI> fittest to be used in each Case; which often contributes more to the Patient's Recovery, than his <HI>Physick</HI>: At the same time, he shall have my best

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>COUGH.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL begin with a <HI>Cough,</HI> which is the Founda∣tion of many bad Distempers, and therefore should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ken Care of as soon as possible. It may be cured in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eginning with riding moderately on Horseback every Day, and only taking a little <HI>Ground Ivy Tea</HI> sweeten'd with <HI>Sy∣rup</HI> of <HI>Horehound,</HI> at Night when you go to Bed. But in case it be violent, it will be proper to <HI>bleed</HI> eight Ounces, and be constant in the Use of the other <HI>Remedies.</HI> In the mean while, you must use a spare and cooling <HI>Diet,</HI> with∣out either Flesh or strong Drink. Nor should you stove yourself up in a warm Room, but breathe as much as pos∣sible in the open Air. And to prevent this Mischief, don't make yourself tender, but wash every Day in cold Water, and very often your Feet.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WHOOPING COUGH.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Whooping Cough</HI> (often fatal to Children) is attend∣ed with a stronger Convulsion than ordinary, which causes the <HI>Whooping.</HI></P>
<P>For this, boil <HI>Hysop</HI> and <HI>Elicampane,</HI> a Handful of each, in 2 Quarts of Water, strain it off, and adding 1 Pound of clean <HI>Muscovado Sugar,</HI> boil it again, and give the Patient 2 Spoonfuls every 3 Hours.</P>
<P>This same Remedy is good for a Shortness of Breath, and a Hoarseness, only in these Cases, <HI>Linseed Tea</HI> sweeten'd with <HI>Honey,</HI> should be the constant Drink, and a spare and cooling <HI>Diet</HI> punctually observed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PLEURISY.</HEAD>
<P>A common Consequence of a violent Cough is a <HI>Pleurisy</HI>; which discovers itself by a brisk Fever, and sharp Pain, pretty low in one of the Sides, shooting now and then into the Breast, and sometimes quite back into the Shoulder Blades: It is uneasy every Time the Patient draws his Breath, and more so when he coughs; which is generally the Case in this Disease.</P>
<P>The Moment any Person finds these Tokens upon him, he must, without Loss of Time, take away 10 Ounces of <HI>Blood,</HI> and repeat the same 3 or 4 Days successively, if the Pain go not away before. On the third Day, he may vomit with 80 Grains of <HI>Indian Physick (Virginian Ipeca∣cuanna)</HI>
<PB N="348" REF="007120_0352_0000000000000000"/>
and every Night drink 7 Spoonfuls of <HI>Pennyroyal Water,</HI> or the Decoction of it, moderately sweeten'd. In the mean Time, let him every three Hours, take Half a Spoonful of <HI>Honey</HI> and <HI>Linseed Oyl</HI> mix'd together. He should also strew <HI>Indian Pepper</HI> upon <HI>Pennyroyal Plaist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> and apply it very hot to the Place where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and be sure to keep himself warm, and abstain from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wa∣ter: Tho' if the Distemper should prove obstinate, you must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Blister</HI> to his Neck, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d one to each Arm, on the fleshy Part above the Elbow.</P>
<P>The Patient's <HI>Diet</HI> should be light and cooling; and his constant Drink, either <HI>Linseed</HI> or <HI>Balm Tea,</HI> a little sweeten'd.</P>
<P>The best Way to prevent this Distemper, will be, to <HI>bleed</HI> in the Beginning of any great Hoarseness, or Cough, and also to forbear swilling great Quantities of Water, or Small Beer, in ordinary Life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FEVER, Pain in the Head, Eye, or Ear.</HEAD>
<P>Something a-kin to this, is a <HI>Fever,</HI> accompanied with a violent Pain in the Head, Neck, or Shoulder, or with an Inflammation in the Eye or Ear. In all these Cases, you must, without Loss of Time, <HI>bleed</HI> 10 Ounces.

<P>Another Distemper consequent to a Cold is a <HI>Quinsey,</HI> known by a Fever, with an Inflammation of the Glands a∣bout the Throat, and of the <HI>Uvula,</HI> to that Degree as to render all Swallowing difficult, and painful. For this, <HI>bleed</HI> immediately 10 Ounces, rather in the Jugular Vein, than in the Arm; and for Safety apply a <HI>Blister</HI> to the Neck.

<P>But in case it prove no more than a common <HI>Sore Throat, purge</HI> only once, and <HI>gargle</HI> with <HI>Papa</HI>'s Liquor, or Sage Tea, sharpened with a little Allom.</P>
<P>In both Cases, your <HI>Diet</HI> ought to be moist and cooling; and your Drink <HI>Cinquefoil Tea.</HI></P>
<P>In order to prevent these Complaints, remember to wash your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eck, and behind your Ears, every Morning, in cold Water; nor muffle up yourself too warm, either Night or Day.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CONSUMPTION.</HEAD>
<P>Next follows a <HI>Consumption,</HI> a Distemper slow and sure, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lately grown very common amongst us. Here young P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple are more in Danger than their Elders, because more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Inflammations. It is usher'd in by a Cough of long C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tinuance, which, by Degrees, inflames and ulcerates the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, brings on a Hectick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever, with a Spitting of bloody an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> corrupted Matter, and is generally attended with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and Night sweats. In the mean Time, the Patient will waste in Strength and in Flesh, while per∣haps he may eat rather more than he used to do when he was well▪</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="007120_0354_0000000000000000"/>After the Ulcer comes to be formed in the Lungs, it will be difficult for inward Remedies to reach it. They may before that, perhaps, cool the Inflammation, as well as sweeten and diminish the sharp Defluxion, so as to prevent an Ulcer, but can rarely heal it. So likewise, <HI>Blisters</HI> and <HI>Issues</HI> may revulse the Humour, and prevent the Mischief, if seasonably made use of.</P>
<P>Therefore all the Good we can hope for, in this melan∣choly Case, must be done while the Consumption is appre∣hended only, and not actually begun. I would then re∣commend <HI>Bleeding</HI> 2 or 3 Ounces every third Day, with a constant Riding about on Horseback, and Change of Air. This will help Nature to throw off the Evil that threatens her, by calming the Blood, opening the Pores, and pro∣moting insensible Perspiration. It may also enable her to make a vigorous Effort, by Means of a seasonable Boil, or Imposthume, on the outward Parts of the Body. For that Intention, I would also advise the Patient to <HI>shave</HI> under the Arms, and apply strong <HI>Poultises,</HI> in order to draw the Mischief, if possible, that Way. And for inward Medi∣cines, let him only chew <HI>Sassafras Root</HI> every Morning fast∣ing. I would likewise intreat him, before he goes to Bed, to take 3 <HI>Pills,</HI> made of <HI>Turpentine</HI> and <HI>Deers Dung,</HI> in equal Quantities: And, besides these, let him once a Week take a <HI>Purge</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> and <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blos∣soms.</HI></P>
<P>Let his <HI>Diet</HI> be without Meat, and mix'd with Abundance of <HI>Turnips, roasted Apples, Raisins,</HI> and <HI>Liquorice</HI>; and let his Drink be Beer brew'd with <HI>Ground-Ivy</HI>; avoiding strong Liquors of every Sort, as he would Poison.</P>
<P>The Way to prevent this wasting Disease, is never to suf∣fer a Cough to dwell upon you; but <HI>bleed</HI> in Time, and <HI>purge</HI> gently once a Week. In the mean while eat not one Morsel of Meat, nor drink any Thing stronger than a little sound <HI>Cyder</HI>: And, to make the Game sure, ride eve∣ry fair Day, and breathe as much as possible in the open Air.</P>

<HEAD>BLOODY-FLUX.</HEAD>
<P>Another mischievous Distemper is the <HI>Bloody-Flux</HI>; the Signs of which are, a small Fever, and grievous Griping. The Patient will also void slimy Excrements streak'd with Blood; and, at the same Time, be cruelly tormented in his Bowels.</P>

<P>To prevent this Disease, avoid sleeping on the cold Ground, and wading in cold Water: Never eat immode∣rately of any Sort of Fruit, nor venture to drink new or foul Cyder by any Means.</P>
<P>And because some People, by fancying this Distemper catching, are fearful of going near those unhappy Persons that have it, by which they often want the Assistance that is necessary; I may venture to assure them, their Apprehen∣sions are groundless; and the Reason this Disease goes some∣times round a Family, is, because they live on the same <HI>Diet,</HI> and breathe in the same Air; and then no wonder if they fall into the same Disorders, one after another, with∣out any Manner of Infection.</P>

<P>Lose no Time in this hasty Disease, but <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>In∣dian Physick,</HI> and <HI>purge</HI> the next Day with the same. In the mean while, you will do well to wear some Skin girt tight on your Stomach and Belly, with the Fur next you, or else a Piece of soft Flannel.</P>

<P>A <HI>Common Looseness</HI> needs no Description; and may be easily stopped in the Beginning; tho' some People hus∣band it so well, as to keep it running for many Years: So that all the Humours of the Body taking that Turn, make it difficult to cure.</P>

<HEAD>CHOLICK.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Cholick</HI> is lately grown a very common Distemper, and begins generally with a grievous Pain in the Bowels; and, by being neglected, fixes at length in the Pit of the Stomach, where it seems to bore like an Augre: The Pa∣tient frequently vomits every Thing he swallows, and can hardly go to Stool, even with the Help of purging Medi∣cines.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="007120_0357_0000000000000000"/>People thus afflicted are apt to fly to Drams for Relief; but with lamentable Success. These may ease a Fit some∣times; but are sure to add Fuel to the Fire, and make the Disease return with more Violence. Besides, these Cor∣dials have another bad Consequence; they are apt to make People soberly enough inclin'd, by Degrees, grow too fond of their Physick. To cure all which bad Effects at once, I would recommend this certain and easy Remedy: Let him leave off all strong, windy and fermented Liquors, and drink nothing but <HI>Water,</HI> enriched with a brown Toast.</P>
<P>But if this Remedy should be esteemed worse than the Disease, I would, however, for the easing a particular Fit, recommend two or three Quarts of <HI>warm Water.</HI> And to force a Passage, you must take three or four Spoonfuls of <HI>Bears Oil,</HI> which will seldom fail; or else drink a Quarter of a Pint of the Decoction of <HI>Peach Leaves,</HI> with two Spoonfuls of Syrup of <HI>Peach Blossoms</HI>; and this Purge you ought to repeat two or three Times to carry off all Remains. But if you would root out the Distemper for ever, take the same Medicines every full Moon; and drink every Morning, for some Time, <HI>Sassafras Tea</HI>; and, at Night, take as much <HI>Snakeroot Powder</HI> as will lie upon a Six pence, in <HI>Mint-water,</HI> or <HI>Decoction.</HI></P>
<P>The Food proper in this Distemper, is <HI>Chicken</HI> or <HI>Mutton Broth</HI>; and the Drink <HI>Balm Tea,</HI> sweeten'd with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Mallows.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DRY-GRIPES.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> are now (blessed be God) grown much rarer than formerly.

<P>It makes itself known by a most tormenting Pain in the Pit of the Stomach, and the adjacent Parts. The Guts feel as if they were twisted, and all Motion downward is in∣terrupted; by this Misfortune, the unhappy Patient is in∣clined to vomit up every Thing; insomuch, that some∣times his very Excrements are cast out at his Mouth. In the first Place, a Thoroughfare must by all Means be at∣tempted,
<PB N="354" REF="007120_0358_0000000000000000"/>
by 3 Spoonfuls of <HI>Bears Oil,</HI> or by the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Peach Leaves,</HI> above mentioned. If these Remedies should fail, you must submit to a <HI>Tobacco Glister,</HI> perform∣ed by blowing the Smoak through a Pipe into the Funda∣ment. And if the first Operation should happen to fail, it must be repeated, till a Passage be opened. At the same time, make a strong Infusion of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and therewith a∣noint the lower Region of the Belly.</P>
<P>After the Passage is perfectly clear'd, your <HI>Diet,</HI> for some Days, ought to be either <HI>Mutton</HI> or <HI>Chicken Broth,</HI> in which <HI>Mallows</HI> have been boil'd; and your Drink <HI>Balm Tea.</HI></P>
<P>Some have unadvisedly, in this Distemper, ventur'd also to drink Rum, and other Spirits, to ease their Pains; but this has cost them dear, by taking away the Use of their Hands, and other <HI>Paralytick</HI> Misfortunes; to cure which, the same Remedies must be used, as are prescribed hereafter for the <HI>Palsey.</HI></P>
<P>The best Way to prevent the <HI>Dry Gripes,</HI> is to get rid of <HI>Agues</HI> and <HI>Cholicks</HI> as soon as you can; to eat sparingly of Fruit, and forbear all foul and windy Liquors; nor meddle with Rum, or other Spirit, after it has been poisoned with foul Sugar and Lime-juice.</P>

<HEAD>PALSEY.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Palsey</HI> comes suddenly upon us, with dreadful Symp∣toms, not easy to be mistaken.

You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to mix equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Quantities of <HI>Spirit of Scurvy-grass,</HI> and <HI>Hungary Water,</HI> and dipping a stiff Comb-brush therein, cause your Head, being close shas'd, to be well brush'd with it several Times a Day; likewise let the Palms of your Hands, the Soles of your Feet, and Nape of your Neck, be often rubb'd with the same Mixture. After this has put some Sense and Motion into your Limbs, beat <HI>Rosemary</HI> in a Mortar, and make a little Ball of it, which you must roll and work about in your Hands continually, renewing the same every Day; now and then too, put Tobacco up your Nostrils, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting it lie there for some Time, in order to drive the clammy Phlegm from your Brain. These easy Remedies will, by the Grace of GOD, do great Good in the Beginning of this Disease, by restoring the Nerves to their natural Tone, and giving new Vigour to the Animal Spirits, which have been clogg'd and obstructed.</P>
<P>The Patient's Food should be dry, and of easy Digestion, with <HI>Mustard</HI> and <HI>Horse-radish</HI> mix'd with it; and let <HI>Sage</HI> or <HI>Balm Tea</HI> be his constant Drink.</P>
<P>To prevent this Distemper, feed seldom on salt or high season'd Dishes, nor eat much Milk, or other phlegmatick Food; never sleep in the dangerous Dew, or on the moist Ground, or continue long in a Cellar; or other damp Si∣tuation. Use much Exercise, and let your Motion be al∣ways nimble, in order to quicken the Circulation, and frisk your sluggish Spirits.</P>

<HEAD>EPILEPSY.</HEAD>
<P>Another Disease of the Head, is an <HI>Epilepsy,</HI> or <HI>Falling Sickness,</HI> not unusual in this Country. It discovers itself by very terrible Symptoms; the unhappy Person falls down suddenly, depriv'd of all Sense and Understanding. No sooner is he fallen, but he's immediately shaken with strong Convulsions, grinds his Teeth, rolls his Eye-balls, and foams at the Mouth in a most frightful Manner. So soon as the Fit is over, his Senses return, but commonly a Pain in the Head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd great Depression of the Spirits remain up∣on him for some Time after. The Return of these melan∣cholly Fits is uncertain, tho', for the most Part, they come near the Full or Change of the Moon.</P>
<P>In the first Place, Care should be taken to calm the Spi∣rits of the Patient, and keep them from running Riot in this unhappy Manner. For that Intention, <HI>bleed</HI> him, and
<PB N="356" REF="007120_0360_0000000000000000"/>
then burn Feathers often under his Nose, or else Leather, or the Hoofs of any Animal.</P>
<P>Four Days before the Full Moon, let him take a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick</HI>; and four Days after the Full Moon, let him take a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same; and be sure to do the like again before and after the Change: And this must be repeated for seven Months together. On the Mornings when he takes no Physick, he must swallow as much <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Misleto,</HI> as will lie upon a Shilling, in a Spoonful of the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Pennyroyal.</HI></P>
<P>For this Purpose, the Leaves and tender Twigs of <HI>Misleto</HI> must be gather'd in <HI>January</HI> (being then in their Prime) dry'd over an Oven moderately warm, and kept all the Year for the Use above mentioned.</P>
<P>Let the Patient's Head be shaved, and a Plaister made of the Juice of <HI>Rue, Sage,</HI> and <HI>Pennyroyal,</HI> worn on the back Part of it.</P>
<P>Let him often put <HI>Tobacco</HI> up one of his Nostrils, keep∣ing it there as long as it has any Strength, to clear the Head of cold and clammy Phlegm. And let him now and then, besides, chew a Stick of <HI>Misleto,</HI> and swallow the Juice.</P>
<P>These Directions must be pursu'd seven Months, or more, to cure any Person intirely of this Distemper; and, if it be taken in Time, there will be great Probability of Success, at least in young People.</P>
<P>Let his Victuals be sparing, and easy of Digestion; and his constant Drink, either <HI>Sage</HI> or <HI>Balm Tea.</HI></P>
<P>As People commonly fall first into this Misfortune while they are Children, so, in order to prevent it, Care should be taken never to fright, or strike them violently on the Head, Back-bone, or Nape of the Neck.</P>

<HEAD>LETHARGY.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Lethargy,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Sleepy Disease,</HI> is an excessive Drowsiness, attended with a Fever, in which the Patient is light-headed when awake. But he is apt to fall into a deep Sleep, from which it is no easy Matter to a∣wake him.</P>
<P>In this Case mix <HI>Rennet</HI> with very strong <HI>Vinegar,</HI> and force it down the Patient's Throat. This must be repeated 3 or 4 Times, and it will generally recover him from his State of Forgetfulness, and by Degrees get the better of the

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Fever, with violent Purging and Vomiting,</HI> can't easily be mistaken. The Stools, tho' frequent, are with great Pain and Difficulty; both the Stomach and Bowels feel ex∣ceeding uneasy, and the whole Frame is in universal Disorder.</P>
<P>As this Disease will hurry a Man soon to his long Home, without speedy Help, you must forthwith make 2 Gallons of thin <HI>Broth,</HI> either of Half a Fowl, or a small Chicken, and drink it all in the Space of 2 or 3 Hours; some of this will come up, and some go down, and cleanse your Sto∣mach and Bowels in such a Manner, as to make you well before you expect it.</P>
<P>Only be careful to live some Days upon light and innocent Fare, boiling <HI>Mint</HI> in every Thing you eat, and grating <HI>Nutmeg</HI> into all your Drink.</P>
<P>Would you prevent this boisterous Illness, forbear all Kind of Surfeiting and Excess, never exposing yourself to be wet to the Skin, if possible.</P>
<P>I must not omit a <HI>Fever and Ague,</HI> which is an Epidemick Distemper in this moist and variable Climate. 'Tis true, it seldom kills now a Days; but if neglected too long, cor∣rupts all the Juices of the Body, and ends either in a <HI>Jaun∣dice, Dropsy, Dry-gripes,</HI> or <HI>Cachexy.</HI> Therefore I con∣jure all my good Patients, as they tender their Health and good Looks, to dispossess this <HI>Devil</HI> as soon as they can.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AGUE.</HEAD>
<P>An <HI>Ague</HI> returns either every Day, every third, or every fourth Day; and the Way to know which of these any Person hath, is only to abide two Fits. If it come eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Day, it will be often accompanied with a Pain in the Head; in which Case, after the second Fit, you must <HI>bleed</HI> 8 Ounces. The next Day <HI>purge</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and two Days after that, repeat the same again. This must be followed, by taking every Morning and Evening 20 Grains of the Powder of <HI>Sassafras Root,</HI> mix'd with 10 Grains of <HI>Snake Root,</HI> in two Spoonfuls of the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Worm∣wood.</HI></P>
<P>If the Fit return every third Day, omit <HI>Bleeding,</HI> in case there be no Pain. After the second Fit, <HI>vomit</HI> one Day with <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and <HI>purge</HI> with the same the

next. If these should not master the Distemper, you must compleat the Cure with the <HI>Powders</HI> of <HI>Sassafras</HI> and <HI>Snake-root,</HI> taken in the Manner aforesaid.</P>
<P>But in case the Return should be every fourth Day, you must after the <HI>Vomit</HI> and <HI>Purge,</HI> take a <HI>Cold Water Sweat</HI>; That is, so soon as the cold Fit is off, and the Fever begins to come on, go into naked Bed, and drink a Pint of <HI>cold Water</HI>; then cover yourself up, and, in a little Time, the Disease will be driven all out at your Pores. However, take the <HI>Powders</HI> after this Operation for some Time, that you may make sure Work of it.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Diet</HI> should be moist and temperate, and drink <HI>Cinquefoil Tea.</HI></P>
<P>It would be difficult to prescribe Rules to prevent a Di∣stemper, to which our Situation is so unhappily subject; however, Prudence may be useful even in this Case. Ride therefore a great deal in the hot Months, to sweat out all indigested Humours; and don't chill your Bowels too much with cold Water. Avoid, as much as may be, being abroad in the Rain, or in the Dews of the Night. Be cautious too of sleeping on the Ground, or with your Win∣dows or Doors open, to let the Wind blow upon you.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CONTINUAL FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>In case of a <HI>Continual Fever, bleed</HI> immediately ten Ounces. The Day following, <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick</HI>; and the Morning after, <HI>purge</HI> with the same. And if you should be light-headed, be convuls'd, or incline too much to Sleep, lay a large <HI>Blister</HI> to the Neck, and to the fleshy Parts of each Arm; and take a <HI>Glister</HI> every Night of <HI>Mallows</HI> and <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms,</HI> to abate the Heat of the Distemper.</P>
<P>It matters not how little People eat in one of these <HI>Fe∣vers,</HI> because the Spirits requisite for Digestion, are em∣ploy'd in struggling with the Disease; But what little Su∣stenance they do take, should be moist and cooling; and their Drink a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Cinquefoil,</HI> taken plentifully.</P>
<P>To prevent this furious Malady, avoid all Excesses of strong Drink, especially of Spirits, which inflame the Blood, at the same time that they vitiate the Ferment of the Stomach; upon which all Digestion, and consequently all Health, depends.</P>

There will be sometimes too, a hard Swelling on one Side of the Belly, that seems to move about.</P>
<P>As this lurking Disorder comes by a long Course of ill Management, so it will need some Time to root it out. For that End, take a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and the next Morning a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same; which <HI>Purge</HI> ought to be repeated once a Week for six Times at least. The Morn∣ings you don't take <HI>Physick,</HI> drink constantly a Quarter of a Pint of <HI>Sassafras Tea</HI> fasting; and every Night, as much <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Snake-root</HI> as will lie upon a Shilling, in three Spoonfuls of <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Dittany.</HI> And if you should be costive, take a <HI>Glister</HI> every other Day of <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Mal∣lows,</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms.</HI> This Method faith∣fully pursued for two Months, with moderate Riding, and a proper Diet, will go near to finish the Cure.</P>
<P>In the mean time eat no Milk, nor any Thing salt or hard of Digestion; but let your Sauce be <HI>Mustard, Garden Cresses,</HI> and <HI>Horse-radish</HI> in Abundance; and your best Drink will be sound <HI>Cyder,</HI> with an hot Iron quench'd in it, or Beer brew'd with <HI>Sorrel Tree Leaves.</HI></P>
<P>Then, to prevent this Illness, you must indulge no sloth∣ful Inclination, but stir about your Business briskly, and ride as often as you can; never drink more than a Pint of Wa∣ter, or other Drink, in 24 Hours.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>But the most fatal Consequence of keeping an <HI>Ague</HI> or <HI>Jaundice</HI> too long, is a <HI>Dropsy.</HI> This dire Calamity befals antient People sometimes, by Means of natural Decay; and sometimes those that are young, when they have made too bold with their Constitution. 'Tis also apt to follow too great a Loss of Blood, or too long a Familiarity with <HI>Opi∣ates.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Dropsy</HI> first shews itself by the Swelling of the Legs a∣bout the Ancles, in such a Manner as to retain the Impres∣sion of your Finger. This Swelling appears most at Night, and is usually attended with a Shortness and Difficulty of Breath, ever most troublesome when the Patient lies down.</P>
<P>He must therefore resolve upon proper Remedies, before the Waters rise high enough to drown him; and if he have but the Gift of Self-denial, he may, by GOD'S Help, get the better of this mortal Enemy; provided there be no universal Decay, no Depravation of the Liver, or other Organs, necessary for Blood-mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng.</P>
<P>Now I can't recommend the Remedies for this Disease better, than by giving three remarkable Instances of Per∣sons of an advanced Age, who have been perfectly cur'd by them.</P>
<P>The first was Sir <HI>Thomas Millington,</HI> an eminent Physi∣cian, who fell into a <HI>Dropsy,</HI> at near 70 Years of Age. After draining the Water, by two or three smart <HI>Purges,</HI> he per∣formed
<PB N="362" REF="007120_0366_0000000000000000"/>
the rest of the Cure by a resolute S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f-denial. He eat nothing but what was light and nourishing; and for his Drink, confined himself rigorously to a Quarter of a Pint of <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine in 24 Hours (and hard <HI>Cyder</HI> would have done the Business as well.) The first Week his Thirst was hardly to be endured; but after that grew more tolerable. He continued this Course for two Months, and recovered com∣pleatly.</P>
<P>The Second was the late Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> who had this Distemper in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his <HI>grand Climacteric.</HI> He <HI>purg'd</HI> two or three Times, drank sparingly of <HI>Canary</HI> and <HI>Water, thick∣ened</HI> with the <HI>Yolk</HI> of a <HI>new-laid Egg</HI>; and all his Victuals besides were cook'd with Abundance of <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Horse-radish.</HI> This Method was pursued with great Constancy for three Months, and blest with intire Success.</P>
<P>The last Instance is an <HI>ancient Gentleman</HI> who trusted to the Remedies of our own Country, with the like happy Effect. He drank the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Sassafras</HI> as soon as he get up, and chew'd the <HI>Root</HI> of it all the rest of the Morn∣ing till Dinner; then observed a light and nourishing <HI>Diet</HI>; and drank moderately of clear sound <HI>Cyder,</HI> wherein an <HI>hot Iron</HI> had been plentifully quench'd, and a little <HI>Allom</HI> dis∣solv'd.</P>
<P>Of these several Remedies you may please to take your Choice; or, instead of <HI>Sassafras,</HI> you may hold the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Pelitary of Spain</HI> in your Mouth, which will salivate still more powerfully.</P>
<P>The rest of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure must be compleated with restorative Meats, and a very short Allowance of Drink. For your <HI>Diet</HI>▪ I would recommend <HI>Poach'd Eggs, thin Hominy, Hogs Feet, Cow Heel,</HI> and <HI>Jelly Broth</HI>; all which will renew and enrich the Blood, without provoking too much Thirst; and for Drink use none but <HI>Sorrel Beer,</HI> or sound <HI>Cyder,</HI> wherein an <HI>hot Iro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> has been quench'd several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>To guard yourself against this wretched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be cautious of scorching your Liver with Spirits, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of other strong Drink. In case you be troubled with <HI>Breeding,</HI> stop it as soon as you can. By no Means accustom yourself to <HI>Opiates,</HI> or suffer an <HI>Ague,</HI> the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> or lingering <HI>Fevers,</HI> to dwell long upon you.</P>
<P>Because I mentioned Loss of Blood to be one Cause of the <HI>Dropsy,</HI> I will hint at some Means to stanch those <HI>Bleedings</HI> that threaten the most Danger.</P>

<HEAD>FLOODING.</HEAD>
<P>In Women a <HI>Dropsy</HI> is often caus'd by <HI>Flooding, or the immoderate Flowing of their Courses.</HI> Let them for this, in the first Place, take away eight Ounces of <HI>Blood,</HI> and then proceed as in the foregoing Case; only they must inject the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Comfry Leaves,</HI> and govern their Passions if they can; nor must any Part of them, not so much as their Tongue, be allowed to have too much Motion.</P>

At the same Time the Patient finds himself weak and low spirited, with a Listlessness to all Manner of Motion.</P>
<P>For this bad Distemper there is this easy and cheap Re∣medy, which rarely fails. Dissolve as much <HI>Allom</HI> in a Pint of Posset Drink as will fit on the Patient's Stomach without vomiting. Of this let him sip now and then two or three Spoonfuls, till all the <HI>Symptoms</HI> go off.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let his Food be easy of Digestion, and his Drink <HI>Balm Tea,</HI> moderately taken, or <HI>Bristol Wa∣ter,</HI> if it can be got.</P>

However, some of the <HI>Symptoms</HI> are a Thumping at the Heart, a Croaking of the Guts, and a Fulness of the Stomach, which the Pa∣tient endeavours to ease, as much as she can, by Belching; every now and then too, something seems to rise up to her Throat, that almost stops her Breath; she has moreover, a great Heaviness and Dejection of Spirit, and a Cloud seems to hang upon all her Senses. In one Word, she has no Re∣lish for any Thing, but is continually out of Humour,

<P>This is certainly a miserable Condition, and the more so, because the Weakness of the Nerves makes the Cure ex∣ceeding difficult.</P>
<P>Because the <HI>Stomach</HI> is suspected to be much in Fault, I would have that cleansed in the first Place, with a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick</HI>; the next Day purify the <HI>Bowels</HI> by a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same; which must be repeated two Days after. The rest of the Cure must be performed by the exact Observa∣tion of the following <HI>Rules.</HI> Endeavour to preserve a cheer∣ful Spirit, putting the best Construction on every Body's Words and Behaviour; plunge three Mornings every Week into cold Water over Head and Ears; which will brace the Nerves, and rouze the sluggish Spirits surprisingly. Observe a strict Regularity and Temperance in your <HI>Diet</HI>; and ride every fair Day small Journeys on Horse-back. Stir nimbly about your Affairs, quick Motion being as necessary for Health of Body, as for Dispatch of Business. In the mean while, I absolutely forbid all Sorts of <HI>Drams,</HI> which will raise the Spirits only to sink them lower; nor do I allow her one Pinch of <HI>Snuff,</HI> or one Drop of <HI>Bohea Tea,</HI> which make People very lumpish and miserable.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Food</HI> must be fresh and easy of Digestion, neither salt nor windy, nor may she eat one Morsel of <HI>Beef,</HI> which affords a gross Nourishment, and inclines People too much to hang themselves. And for her Drink, she must forbear <HI>Beer,</HI> with all windy and fermented Liquors; and stick to <HI>Balm Tea</HI> entirely.</P>
<P>To escape this Disorder, she must suffer none of the idle Disturbances, or Disappointments of an empty World, to prey upon her Mind, or ruffle her sweet Temper. Let her use just Exercise enough to give a gentle Spring to her Spi∣rits, without wasting them; and let her be cheerful in spite of a churlish Husb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, or cloudy Weather.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>POX.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Pox</HI> may be cured exactly in the same Manner; and, because the <HI>Symptoms</HI> are much the same, it is very probable the One was a Graft of the other. The pious <HI>Spaniards</HI> catch'd it from their <HI>Negroe</HI> Mistresses in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and had the Honour of propagating it from thence to all the rest of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="007120_0374_0000000000000000"/>In both Cases, confine yourself altogether from eating Flesh, and from strong Drink, and be very careful of catch∣ing Cold.</P>
<P>To avoid this Misfortune, eat seldom of fresh <HI>Pork,</HI> which breeds very gross Humours; live not too near a Swamp; nor ever venture upon strange Women, especially not on <HI>Ethiopians.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CANCER.</HEAD>
<P>Another woful Case is a <HI>Cancer,</HI> which some despairingly imagine to be incurable; tho' blessed be GOD, there have been some Instances of Success, by the Method hereafter mentioned. In the mean time, it usually begins with lit∣tle hard Lumps, or Swellings in the Breast, Lip, or other glandulous Part of the Body. These afterwards break into painful Sores, which eat farther and farther, till at last they reach some large Vessel, or mortal Part.</P>
<P>In this Case, the Patient must submit, in the first Place, to have the hard Lump cut clean out, so soon as he is con∣vinc'd it is a <HI>Cancer.</HI> And, for curing the Wound, he can't do better than make Use of the following <HI>Balsam</HI>: He must boil 6 Ounces of <HI>Sassafras Root,</HI> and as much <HI>Dogwood Root</HI> in a <HI>Gallon</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> till it be wasted to a <HI>Pint,</HI> and having strain'd it off▪ must drench a <HI>Pledget</HI> therein, and apply it warm to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, renewing it every Day: And if he will have the Patience to continue this for some Time, I can assure him he will not be the first that has been blest with Success.</P>
<P>Let him drink <HI>Sassafras Tea</HI> every Morning, live tempe∣rately upon light and innocent Food, and abstain intirely from strong Liquor.</P>
<P>The Way to prevent this Calamity, is to be very spar∣ing in eating fresh <HI>Pork,</HI> to forbear all salt and high sea∣son'd Meats, and live chiefly upon the Garden, the Or∣chard, and the Hen-house.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Rheumatism</HI> is a wandering Pain that shifts from one Joint or Part of the Body to another, and is generally ac∣companied with a small Fever.</P>
<P>For this <HI>bleed</HI> 10 Ounces, the next Day <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and the Day after that take a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same. After all this, boil a Shin of <HI>Beef</HI> in a <HI>Gallon</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> till one Half be wasted. Put into what remains a Pound of <HI>Garlick,</HI> and stew it till it comes to 3 Pints. Then strain it
<PB N="371" REF="007120_0375_0000000000000000"/>
again, and take a Quarter of a Pint, <HI>blood warm,</HI> Morning and Evening for 3 Days, and you will find Relief.</P>
<P>As this Distemper happens by a violent cold, great Care should be taken to prevent the unhappy Cause.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>I shall next say something of the <HI>Gout,</HI> which I observe with Pleasure to be grown less frequent in the Country, than in the Time of our Fathers. It makes itself known with a Vengeance, by a painful Inflammation in some of the Joints, especially of the Hands and Feet.</P>
<P>It would be great Presumption, after so many vain At∣tempts, for me to recommend any other Remedy for this obstinate Distemper, than a strict and severe Temperance, both in Eating and Drinking. Nevertheless, I am not so hard hearted, as to deny my Patient any Kind of fresh and plain Food, that agrees with his Stomach: All I intreat of him, is to confine himself religiously to a moderate Quantity. Nor can he do better, than to follow the Example of <HI>Cor∣nara,</HI> a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> who tied himself down to 12 Ounces of Eatables, including Bread, and 14 Ounces of Drink, in the 24 Hours. He stuck close to this short Allowance, using moderate Exercise; and, from being a Cripple by the <HI>Gout,</HI> recovered his Health, and his Strength, to a Won∣der: And having found so much Benefit by these Rules, pursued them strictly to the End of a very long and happy Life.</P>
<P>Nor are these Weights so scanty as they may seem to be to some keen Stomachs; but, upon a fair Trial, they will be found sufficient to give Strength to the Body, Chearful∣ness to the Heart, and Vigour to all the Faculties of the Soul. And, besides these happy Effects, they will do more: They will place you above the Influence of the Stars; and make you able to subdue your Passions, to the Empire of a cool and unclouded Understanding.</P>
<P>The same Temperance that cures this Distemper, will certainly not fail to prevent it; make you live a great while, and very easy while you do live.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BITE of a RATTLE SNAKE.</HEAD>
<P>If any One should have the Misfortune to be bit by a <HI>Rattle Snake,</HI> let him kill the <HI>Viper</HI> immediately, and apply its <HI>Fat</HI> to the Wound. This will sheathe the <HI>Poison,</HI> and give Time for other Remedies to expel it out of the <HI>Blood.</HI> The readiest Cure I know, is St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s <HI>Cross,</HI> which
<PB N="372" REF="007120_0376_0000000000000000"/>
grows providentially all over the Woods, during th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole Season that the <HI>Snakes</HI> are mischievous.</P>
<P>Let him take 60 Grains of the <HI>Root</HI> reduced to <HI>Powder,</HI> or a strong <HI>Decoction</HI> of the Leaves and tender Branches, and if one Dose should not finish the Cure, he must take a Second. There are other Plants growing in this Country that will answer the same Intention, such as the <HI>Fern Rat∣tle-snake Root, Ginger Snake-root,</HI> the smaller <HI>Assa Rebecca, Oak of Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>Dittany</HI>; but St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s <HI>Cross</HI> is as powerful as any, and much easier procur'd, being the Growth of every Soil, that hath not been clear'd thro' the whole Colony. Nor is there any <HI>Indian</HI> Trader, but can bear Witness to its Virtue in this Particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BITE of a MAD DOG.</HEAD>
<P>For the <HI>Bite of a Mad Dog,</HI> which may be reckoned a∣mong the greatest of Calamities, Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> has communi∣cated the following Remedy to the World which he had tried on more than 500 Persons, with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> constan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Success.</P>
<P>The Patient, as soon as possible after his Misfortune▪ should <HI>bleed</HI> about 10 Ounces. Then let him take of <HI>Ash-colour'd Ground Liver Wort,</HI> dry'd and powder'd, Half an Ounce; which grows on moist sandy barren Soils. He must mix with this two Drachms of <HI>powder'd black Pepper.</HI> Divide those into Four <HI>Doses,</HI> and let him take one every Morning fasting in Half a Pint of <HI>warm Milk.</HI> After this, the Patient must be plung'd over Head and Ears in very <HI>cold Water</HI> every Morning fasting, for a Month together, never staying longer than Half a Minute at a Time. When he has bath'd in this Manner so long, he need go in no more than three Times a Week for a Fortnight longer, by which Time the Cure, by the Grace of GOD, will be happily compleated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Liverwort</HI> should be gathered in <HI>October,</HI> and dry'd carefully in the Shade.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FILM.</HEAD>
<P>In case a <HI>Film</HI> should grow over the Sight of the <HI>Eye,</HI> oc∣casioned by a Blow, a sharp Humour, or other Accident, you may take it off with this easy and cheap Remedy. Dry <HI>Human Dung</HI> in the <HI>Sun</HI> that is yellow, and of a good Con∣sistence, and having reduced it to a very fine <HI>Powder,</HI> blow it thro' a Quill two or three Times a Day into the <HI>Eye,</HI> and your Sight will be happily restored in a short Time.</P>

<HEAD>SORE EYES.</HEAD>
<P>Common <HI>Sore Eyes</HI> may be cur'd by washing them with <HI>Breast Milk,</HI> warm <HI>Sage Tea,</HI> or with <HI>Rose Water,</HI> taking Care in the mean time not to rub them if they itch, or ex∣pose them to the cold Air.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SPRAIN.</HEAD>
<P>If by any <HI>Fall,</HI> or <HI>False Step,</HI> you should happen to sprain a Joint, clap it into <HI>cold Water</HI> as soon as possible, and keep it there for several Minutes. Then cover the Part all over with a Poultis of <HI>Clay</HI> well temper'd with <HI>strong Vinegar,</HI> which must be bound on securely. When the first grows dry, apply another, which will probably finish the Cure without the Expence of a <HI>Surgeon.</HI></P>
<P>And now I mention <HI>Surgeons,</HI> by the good Leave of those Gentlemen, I will recommend to my poor Country∣men an easy Remedy for some little Complaints that fall within their <HI>proper Province.</HI> Nor will they take it amiss, I hope, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> endeavour to help such indigent Persons as cannot purchase their Assistance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BROKEN SHIN.</HEAD>
<P>If any One therefore should break a <HI>Shin,</HI> or have any o∣ther <HI>green Wound</HI> (which, by being neglected, often comes to be very troublesome) let him only make use of that <HI>Bal∣sam,</HI> which the compassionate <HI>Samaritan</HI> apply'd to the Wounds of the poor <HI>Israelite</HI> who fell amongst Thieves. Boil <HI>Oil Olive</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> in equal Quantities (and if you add a little clean <HI>Muscovado Sugar,</HI> it will be so much the better) Drench a <HI>Pledget</HI> well in this <HI>Balsam,</HI> with which cover the whole Sore, and keep it on with any sticking Plaisters, and it will be healed in one or two Dressings. I have likewise cur'd very bad Ulcers with it, but then I kept the Patient to a spare and cooling <HI>Diet,</HI> making him drink <HI>Papa</HI>'s Liquor all the Time, and cleanse the Sore with the same every Time it was dressed. In these Cases, it need not be dressed more than once in two Days, because it should be exposed as seldom as possible to the cold Air.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SWELLING to DISCUSS.</HEAD>
<P>If you have a <HI>Swelling</HI> in any Part which you would dis∣cuss, mix <HI>powder'd Brimstone,</HI> with the Juice of <HI>James Town Weed,</HI> and thereof make an Ointment with fresh <HI>Hogs Lard.</HI> Anoint with this twice or thrice a Day, keeping the Part warm, and you will rarely fail of Success.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SEAR CLOTH.</HEAD>
<P>If you should have a Pain in the <HI>Back, Loins,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Part, that requires a <HI>Sear Cloth</HI> to asswage it, the most ef∣fectual One I can recommend to you, is made after the fol∣lowing Manner. Powder the Root of <HI>Assa Rebecca, Com∣fry</HI> and <HI>Snake Root,</HI> then mix them with as much common <HI>Turpentine</HI> as will make a large Plaister, which apply hot to the Part, and it will give speedy Relief.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DEAFNESS.</HEAD>
<P>If any one should by Cold or other Accident become <HI>Deaf,</HI> let him take the <HI>Bulb</HI> of a large <HI>Onion,</HI> and scoop out a pretty deal of the Inside. Then let him fill the hol∣low Part Half full of <HI>Rattle Snake Oil,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it on a <HI>Grid-Iron</HI> over <HI>live Coals,</HI> till the <HI>Pulp</HI> of the <HI>Onion</HI> incor∣porate with the <HI>Oil.</HI> Then strain it, and going to Bed, drop two Drops into the Patient's Ear very warm. After∣wards stop it with <HI>Cotton,</HI> and repeat it six or seven Times, and you will have Reason to applaud the Medicine.</P>
<P>Thus I have run through most of the common Com∣plaints, to which the Inhabitants of this Colony are subject; and prescrib'd such innocent Cures, as will generally suc∣ceed, if timely made Use of; yet am far from pretending that any of them are infallible; We all know that <HI>Death</HI> strikes so home in some Cases, that all <HI>Physick</HI> is vain. There are many Instances too, where the Diseases of our Climate have a little <HI>Dash</HI> of the <HI>Pox,</HI> the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> or the <HI>Gout</HI>; and then they need a <HI>RATCLIFF</HI> or a <HI>FRIEND</HI> to get the better of them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it may seem strange, that, among the Remedies I have prescribed, no honourable Mention is made of <HI>Mercury, Opium,</HI> or the <HI>Peruvian Bark,</HI> which have almost obtain'd the Reputation of <HI>Specificks.</HI> I ac∣knowledge the powerful Effects of these Medicines, but am perswaded they ought to be administred with the greatest Skill and Discernment. And, as I write only for the Ser∣vice of the Poor, who are wholly left to judge for them∣selves, I was fearful of putting such dangerous Weapons into their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="007120_0379_0000000000000000"/>If those of better Circumstances find any Thing here that may, in any Manner, deserve their Attention, I should be exceeding glad; tho' I own these Directions▪ were not designed for such as are in Condition to purchase more <HI>learned Advice.</HI> It was only to those whom Fortune has placed below the Regard of our <HI>Doctors,</HI> that I address this short Essay; and if one single Person shall be recov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d thereby, or receive the least Relief, I shall account my Pains happily bestowed.</P>

<P>THIS Book, intituled, <HI>Every Man his own Doctor,</HI> was first printed in <HI>Virginia,</HI> for the Use of which Colony it was written by a Gentleman residing there. Great Numbers have been distributed among the People both in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> and 'tis generally allowed that A∣bundance of Good has been thereby done.

It is necessary, however, to give the Reader this one Caution, that the <HI>Ipecacuana</HI> or <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> so frequently prescribed by the Author, is much weaker in <HI>Virginia,</HI> than that which grows in <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI>; so that whereas he prescribes 80 Grains for a Vomiting Potion, and 70 for a Purge; 12 Grains of our <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> or <HI>Ipecacuana,</HI> will be sufficient for a Vo∣mit, and 10 for a Purge: There is another Sort which comes to us from <HI>Europe,</HI> and is to be found in the Apothe∣caries Shops, of which 30 or 32 Grains is commonly gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven for a Vomit, and 27 for a Purge, which will work mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Constitutions sufficiently.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>A Physician in <HI>Virginia</HI> has lately published an Essay or the <HI>Pleurisy</HI>; in which he discovers a Method <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treating that fatal Distemper, that he says he always found to succeed. The principal Part of the Cure depends on the Use of a Simple that begins to be known in this Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try by the Name of <HI>Rattle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake Root,</HI> being the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which the <HI>Indians</HI> use in curing the Bite of that venomou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="379" REF="007120_0383_0000000000000000"/>
Reptile. The Method which the Author practises and recommends, is as follows▪</P>
<P>"Let the Patient first have 10 Ounces of Blood taken from the Arm of the well Side or Foot, if both Sides are affected; and every six Hours 3 Spoonfuls of the following Tincture is to be given, the first Dose immediately after, and continued till the Symptoms abate.</P>
<Q><P>Take of the <HI>Rattle Snake Root,</HI> 3 Ounces, <HI>wild Vale∣rian Root,</HI> an Ounce and a Half, let them be well bruised in a Mortar, then mix them with a Quart of old <HI>Canary,</HI> and digest in a proper Vessel in a Sand Heat for six Hours, afterwards decant for Use.</P>
<P>Let fifteen Drops of <HI>Balsam Capivi,</HI> and as many of <HI>Sal Vola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile Oleosum,</HI> be given in a little ordinary Drink, twice between each Dose of the Tincture, beginning with the first Dose two Hours after the Tincture; and give the second Dose two Hours after.</P>
<P>Let the ordinary Drink be a Tea made of <HI>Marsh∣mallow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> always given warm.</P>
<P>If the Patient has been ill some Days before any Thing administred, the <HI>Balsam</HI> is to be continued for some Days after a considerable Amendment.</P>
<P>Blood-letting is to be repeated the second Day, and in the same Quantity as the first, if the Patient is not much better, or the same Day, unless something better in four Hours: But such is the Efficacy of this Medicine, that there is seldom Occasion. The Symptoms generally a∣bate considerably in 24 Hours, and the Recovery certain.</P></Q>
<P>But because every One may not have Conveniency for pre∣paring this Tincture, nor have the other Medicines men∣tioned at Hand, and don't live within Reach of a Physician, it is necessary to acquaint the Reader with what the Author adds further, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>A Decoction of the <HI>Rattle Snake Root</HI> alone in Spring Water, three Ounces to about one Quart; together with Pectoral Teas sweetened with Honey, <HI>will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> effectual</HI> without <HI>any thing else,</HI> if the Patient has been let Blood as soon as taken, and this Decoction imme∣diately given afterwards.</Q></P>
<P>This is to be understood of the genuine <HI>Pleurisy</HI> or <HI>Pe∣ripneumony</HI> attended with a Fever.</P>
<P>As for the other Disease, which often personates a <HI>Pleu∣risy</HI> in these Parts, the Symptoms of which are, that the
<PB N="380" REF="007120_0384_0000000000000000"/>
Patient is cold in a <HI>somniferous</HI> State, and sometimes con∣vulsed.</P>
<P>In this Case the Author omits Blood-letting as pernicious; but says the Tincture aforesaid is as effectual here as in the genuine <HI>Pleurisy,</HI> only advises that the <HI>Rattle Snake Root</HI> and Valerian be in equal Quantites.</P>
<P>We have not Room to add more out of the abovemen∣tioned Essay; and indeed the greatest Part of it being taken up in abstracted Reasonings on the Texture of the Blood, and the Operations of different Medicines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to make a larger Extract would be of little Use to the unlearned Read∣er, for whom this Book was originally intended; and it is supposed that in Cases of Danger, the Patient will always consult a skilful Physician w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere it can possibly be done.</P>
<P>But while we are solicitous about the Health of the Bo∣dy, let us not forget, that there are also <HI>Diseases of the Mind,</HI> which concern us no less to be thoroughly cured of. The divine Assistance and Blessing on our Endeavours is ab∣solutely necessary in both Cases; which we ought there∣fore piously and devoutly to request. And being healed, let us gratefully bless and praise that GREAT PHY∣SICIAN, from whose Goodness flows every Virtue, and the Discovery of every useful Medicine.</P>

<HEAD>Advice to a young Tradesman, written by an old One.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To my Friend <HI>A. B.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As you have desired it of me, I write the following Hints▪ which have been of Service to me, and may, if observed, be so to you.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that TIME is Money. He that can earn <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> a Day by his Labour, and goes abroad, or sits idle one Half of that Day, tho' he spends
<PB N="382" REF="007120_0386_0000000000000000"/>
but <HI>Six-pence</HI> during his Diversion or Idleness, ought not to reckon that the only Expence; he has really spent, or ra∣ther thrown away, <HI>Five Shillings</HI> besides.</P>
<P>Remember that CREDIT is Money. If a Man lets his Money lie in my Hands after i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> due, he gives me the In∣terest, or so much as I can make of it during that Time▪ This amounts to a considerable Sum where a Man has good and large Credit, and makes good Use of it.</P>
<P>Remember that Money is of a prolifick generating Na∣ture. Money can beget Money, and its Offspring can be∣get more, and so on. <HI>Five Shillings</HI> turned, is <HI>Six</HI>▪ Turn'd again, 'tis <HI>Seven</HI> and <HI>Three-pence</HI>; and so on till it becomes an <HI>Hundred Pound.</HI> The more there is of it, the more it produces every Turning, so that the Profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding Sow, de∣stroys all her Offspring to the Thousa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dth Generation. He that murders a Crown, destroys all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have produced, even Scores of <HI>Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>Remember that <HI>Six Pounds</HI> a Year is but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Day. For this little Sum (which may be daily wasted either in Time or Expence unperceiv'd) a Man of Credit may, on his own Security, have the constant Possession and Use of an <HI>Hundred Pounds.</HI> So much in Stock briskly turn'd by an industrious Man, produces great Advantage.</P>
<P>Remember this saying, <HI>That the good Pay-master is Lord of another Man's Purse.</HI> He that is known to pay punctu∣ally and exactly to the Time he promises, may, at any Time, and on any Occasion, raise all the Money his Friends can spare. This is sometimes of great Use; therefore ne∣ver keep borrow'd Money an Hour beyond the Time you promised, left a Disappointment shut up your Friend's Purse for ever.</P>
<P>The most trifling Actions that affect a Man's Credit, are to be regarded. The Sound of your Hammer at Five in the Morning, or Nine at Night, heard by a Creditor, makes him easy six Months longer. But if he sees you at a Bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard Table, or hears your Voice in a Tavern, when you should be at Work, he sends for his Money the next Day. Finer Cloaths than he or his Wife wears, or greater Expence in any Particular than he affords himself, shocks his Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and he duns you to humble you. Creditors are a Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of People, that have the sharpest Eyes and Ears, as well as the best Memories of any in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="007120_0387_0000000000000000"/>Good-natur'd Creditors (and such one would always chuse to deal with if one could) feel Pain when they are oblig'd to ask for Money. Spare 'em that Pain, and they will love you. When you receive a Sum of Money, di∣vide it among 'em in Proportion to your Debts. Don't b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> asham'd of paying a small Sum because you owe a greater<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Money, more or less, is always welcome; and your Cre∣ditor had rather be at the Trouble of receiving <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> voluntarily brought him, tho' at ten different Times or Payments, than be oblig'd to go ten Times to demand it before he can receive it in a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp. It shews, besides, that you are mindful of what you owe; it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest Man; and that still encreases your Credit.</P>
<P>Beware of thinking all your own that you possess, and of living accordingly. 'Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Mistake that many People who have Credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact Ac∣count, for some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, of both your Expences and your In∣comes. If you take the Pains at first to mention Particu∣lars, it will have this good Effect; you will discover how wonderfully small trifling Expences mount up to large Sums, and will discern what might have been, and may, for the fu∣ture, be saved, without occasioning any great Inconvenience.</P>
<P>In short, the Way to Wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the Way to Market. It depends chiefly on two Words, INDUSTRY and FRUGALITY; <HI>i. e.</HI> Waste neither Time nor Money, but make the best Use of both. He that gets all he can honestly, and saves all he gets (necessary Expen∣ces excepted) will certainly become RICH: If that Being who governs the World, to whom all should look for a Blessing on their honest Endeavours, doth not in his wise Providence otherwise determine.</P>
