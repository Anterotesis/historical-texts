<HEAD>LECTURE I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. OF Electricity in general, with some Account of its Discovery.</P>
<P N="2">II. Experiments, showing that Electricity, when produced by the Friction of Glass, is not created by that Friction.</P>
<P N="3">III. That it is not extracted out of the Substance of the Glass.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That it is not collected out of the circumambient Air. But,</P>
<P N="5">V. That the excited Glass receives it from the Rubber, and other conducting Matter communicating with the Earth; the Whole terraqueous Globe, with every Thing there∣on, containing naturally a certain Quantity of it.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That even our Bodies contain enough of it to set a House on Fire.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That it is not the same with culinary Fire.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That it has, when in a State of Rest, no sensible Heat.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That, when it darts thro' the Air from our Body to another, it will produce Heat by its violent Motion. <HI>The two last Propositions will be proved by a very accurate Thermometer of a new Construction.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="4" REF="009708_0004_0F7A46994930BCC8"/>X. That it will subsist in WATER as well as in any other Matter; the greatest Quantity thereof being not sufficient to quench the smallest Spark of it.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That Sparks of it may be seen and felt rising out of cold Water, or even a Piece of Ice, which will kindle up a burning Flame.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That it is an extremely <HI>subtile</HI> Matter; as appears by its passing with the greatest Readiness through so dense a Body as Metal.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That it takes no perceptible Time in passing through large Portions of Space.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That Glass and Sealing-Wax, as well as several other Substances, when excited by Friction, produce quite contrary Effects; one encreasing, the other diminishing the natural Quantity of Electricity in whatever Body is electrised thereby; which will be shown by several Experiments made with a Globe of each.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That seperate Bodies having different Quantities of it in Proportion to their re∣spective Magnitudes, mutually <HI>attract</HI> each other; and the greater the Difference, the stronger the Attraction.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. That suspended Bodies in Contact, upon having their natural Quantity either en∣creased, or diminished, mutually <HI>recede</HI> from each other.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That Bodies thus seperated, will immediately come again into Contact, if the
<PB N="5" REF="009708_0005_0F7A469A0B131928"/>
Air surrounding them be made to have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="obscured" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same Degree of Electricity that they have.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That Bodies containing just the <HI>natural Quantity,</HI> will recede from each other, if the Air wherein they are suspended, be made to have either <HI>more</HI> or <HI>less</HI> than that Quantity.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That different Quantities of it in se∣perate Bodies, may be reduced to an Equality by Means of Metal in Form of a slender sharp Point, at a greater Distance than in any other Form.</P>
<P N="20">XX. A Shower of electrised Sand, rising again as fast as it falls.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. An Artificial Spider, animated by Electricity so as to act like a live one.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. A Representation of the <HI>Sensitive Plant.</HI></P>
<P N="23">XXIII. A new Property discovered in electri∣sed Points; by means of which will be ex∣hibited an electrical <HI>Horse-Race.</HI></P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Eight musical Bells rung by an elec∣trised Phial of Water.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. A Battery of eleven Guns, discharg∣ed by Fire issuing out of a Person's Finger.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. A Description and Explanation of the famous <HI>Leyden Experiment,</HI> which is the Foundation of most of the principal Discoveries that have been since made in Electricity.</P>
<P N="2">II. An <HI>empty</HI> Bottle performing the <HI>Leyden Experiment,</HI> without having any non-electric Matter communicating with its inner Surface.</P>
<P N="3">III. The amazing Force of Electricity in pasing through a Number of Bodies at the same Instant.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A diverting Eperiment, which cannot well be comprehended but by those who try it.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Electrised Money,</HI> which few Persons will take when offered to them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Electricity shown to be the same with Lightning.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A bright Flash of real Lightning, darting from a Cloud in a painted Thunder-Storm.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="7" REF="009708_0007_0F7A469B89479858"/>VIII. The Cause and Effects of Lightning explained.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The Force of a small Quantity of it making a fair Hole through a Quire of Paper.</P>
<P N="10">X. An Animal killed by it instantaneously.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Metal melted by it on Glass, and some of the Metal incorporated with the Substance of the Glass.</P>
<P N="12">XII. A Wire <HI>heated</HI> by it so as to become <HI>red</HI> and <HI>burning hot.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. An Experiment showing why Thun∣der Clouds float lower in the Air than other Clouds; and why Eminences are most fre∣quently struck by Lightning.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Why Lightning darts through the Air in a crooked Direction.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Why it is more frequent in Summer than Winter.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. An Experiment showing how Houses, Ships, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be secured from being damaged by Lightning.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. What Part, in a House not so se∣cured, is safest to be in, during a Thunder-Gust,
<PB N="8" REF="009708_0008_0F7A469D156D65B8"/>
in Case the House should be struck with Lightning.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. The Endeavouring to guard against Lightning, in the Manner proposed, shown to be not chargeable with Presumption, nor inconsistent with any of the Principles, either of natural or revealed Religion.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. A curious Machine put in Motion by Lightning, and playing various Tunes on eight musical Bells.</P>
<P N="20">XX. A Battery of eleven Guns discharged by Lightning, after it has darted through ten Feet of Water.</P>
