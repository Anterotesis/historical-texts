<L><HI>The Plain no Pasture to the Flock affords.</HI>—</L>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EHOLD, and see how deeply we</L>
<L>do feel divine Displeasure;</L>
<L>Our Land before has never bore</L>
<L>of Wrath so great a Measure:</L>
<L>Distress and War, both near and far,</L>
<L>Home, and Abroad Vexation;</L>
<L>Our Enemies, against us rise</L>
<L>for to cut off our Nation.</L>
<L>Our frontier Towns, the Land around,</L>
<L>are miserably wasted;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="008201_0003_102E4A841B4FAB30"/>
Of Cruelty, large Measure we</L>
<L>most certainly have tasted.</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> combine, the <HI>Indians</HI> join</L>
<L>their antichristian Powers,</L>
<L>For to destroy both low and high</L>
<L>from off this Land of our's.</L>
<L>Alas! from Peace we now must cease,</L>
<L>to go where Cannon rattle;</L>
<L>Our Ploughs forsake, and Weapons take,</L>
<L>from Husbandry to Battle:—</L>
<L>Our tender Wives commit our Lives</L>
<L>unto divine Protection,</L>
<L>Not thinking we'll each other see</L>
<L>until the Resurrection;</L>
<L>Parting with Sighs, and wat'ry Eyes,</L>
<L>our Leaders we must follow</L>
<L>Unto the Field, our Swords to wield,</L>
<L>and in our Blood to wallow:</L>
<L>We meet our Foes, and them oppose</L>
<L>with Drums and Cannon sounding;—</L>
<L>Hark! hear our Voice, confused Noise</L>
<L>from Hill to Hill rebounding:</L>
<L>The Field all o'er with purple Gore</L>
<L>is stain'd, while Men lay dying;</L>
<L>Some with a Groan their Case bemoan,</L>
<L>others for Mercy crying;</L>
<L>With aking Hearts, each one exerts</L>
<L>the utmost of his Power,</L>

Still lohging the Event to see,</L>
<L>each Minute seems an Hour:—</L>
<L>Some Battles they <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> have won the Day,</L>
<L>and Forts, and Men destroyed;</L>
<L>Sometimes again, our Countrymen</L>
<L>has them as much annoyed.</L>
<L>The Mob <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> of Hell, whose savage Yell,</L>
<L>with Visage grim and painted;—</L>
<L>Would surely make a Heart to quake,</L>
<L>that's with them unacquainted;</L>
<L>Whilst wer'e at Work, these lay and lurk</L>
<L>about our Fields and Pastures,</L>
<L>Then suddenly upon us fly,</L>
<L>and so of us get Masters:</L>
<L>When any Man falls in their Hands,</L>
<L>they're Cruel and Insulting;</L>
<L>But most acute, these human Brutes,</L>
<L>at Killing are, and Scalping:—</L>
<L>Likewise again, our Land within,</L>
<L>we greatly are distressed;</L>
<L>Our Taxes lie both hard and high,</L>
<L>wherewith we are oppressed;</L>
<L>Yielding Supports for building Forts,</L>
<L>and for maintaining Soldiers;</L>
<L>It makes us Cry, where this doth lie,</L>
<L>and gaul our peeled Shoulders.</L>
<L>Our Fishing-Trade is much decay'd:</L>
<L>likewise our foreign Traders</L>

Much Misery do suffer by</L>
<L>our insolent Invaders:</L>
<L>Whole Houses stroy'd, and render'd void,</L>
<L>hath been the Destination</L>
<L>Of many a one, who out upon</L>
<L>our Frontiers had his Station:</L>
<L>These Judgments we both feel, and see,</L>
<L>and with them are perplexed,</L>

<L>But whence came these our Miseries?</L>
<L>from Casualty or Fortune,</L>
<L>Or be the Fates with our Estates</L>
<L>and Lives, themselves a sporting?</L>
<L>Such Seasons we did never see</L>
<L>in any Generation</L>
<L>This Land within, since it has been</L>
<L>possessed by our Nation:</L>

<HEAD>The procuring CAUSE.</HEAD>
<L>THEN let us try if we can spy</L>
<L>wherein we have offended</L>
<L>Our angry God, for which his Rod</L>
<L>unto us is extended;</L>
<L>Our Land has been a Place wherein</L>
<L>the Lord hath shewed Favour;</L>
<L>Where Gospel-Light hath shined bright,</L>
<L>with sweet, and heav'nly Savour:</L>
<L>But now, alas! sad, awful Case!</L>
<L>how many of our Nation</L>
<L>Slight, and abuse the blessed News,</L>
<L>and Tidings of Salvation!</L>
<L>Our Love grows cold, in Sin we're bold,</L>
<L>Iniquity abounding,</L>
<L>Spreads o'er the Land, I understand,</L>
<L>like to a Deluge drowning!</L>
<L>Our Ministers, like pilot Stars,</L>
<L>should guide in this Declention;—</L>
<L>But, ah! how rare they answer their</L>
<L>original Intention!</L>
<L>How very few, when first they do</L>
<L>accept of the Vocation,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="008201_0007_102E4A8D88CF2468"/>
Sincerely aim to praise God's Name,</L>
<L>and to promote Salvation!</L>
<L>How very few among them shew</L>
<L>from <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> a Warrant;</L>
<L>Whose Holy walk, and Heav'nly talk</L>
<L>promote the Gospel errand!</L>
<L>How very are they every where,</L>
<L>through this Part of our Nation,</L>
<L>Are apt to teach, and likewise preach,</L>
<L>with Pow'r and Demonstration;</L>
<L>Causing, that few we see into</L>
<L>God's Family adopted;</L>
<L>Which demonstrates how much he hates</L>
<L>a Minist'ry corrupted:—</L>
<L>And, our Trustees of all Degrees,</L>
<L>who are with Pow'r invested</L>
<L>To watch the Ground, God's Vineyard round,</L>
<L>and see it not molested;</L>
<L>Who ought in Case of Fatherless</L>
<L>and Widows to be Pleaders,</L>
<L>And in <HI>Christ's</HI> Cause, and for his Laws,</L>
<L>should be the foremost Leaders;</L>
<L>Alas! must I against them cry?</L>
<L>for Reverence such I owe them,</L>
<L>If conscience could, I freely would</L>
<L>in my Complaint forgo them:</L>
<L>Pride, carnal Ease, the Flesh to please,</L>
<L>Injustice, and Oppression,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="008201_0008_102E4AA18C6DC728"/>
They awfully are tainted by,</L>
<L>must be my sad Confession:</L>
<L>Good <HI>Joshua</HI> his Path this Day</L>
<L>how much by them despised;</L>
<L>With Family Pray'r, how very rare</L>
<L>will they be stigmatized;</L>
<L>How often, when they get poor Men</L>
<L>unto a lawless Border,</L>
<L>We hear a cry of Treachery,</L>
<L>Oppression, and Disorder:</L>
<L>And they likewise, who in their Lives</L>
<L>exalt free Grace's Donor,</L>
<L>How seldom they promoted be</L>
<L>to any Post of Honour:—</L>
<L>And likewise in our common Men,</L>
<L>in this <HI>New-English</HI> Nation,</L>
<L>All Wickedness increased is</L>
<L>in Life, and Conversation;</L>
<L>Many a Heart from God doth part,</L>
<L>to worship earthly Treasure;</L>
<L>Whose Tongues prophane abuse his Name;</L>
<L>and take therein great Pleasure:—</L>
<L>Unchristian walk, vile filthy Talk</L>
<L>is every where abounding;</L>
<L>Impertinence, and vile Nonsense,</L>
<L>the Soul and Conscience wounding;</L>
<L>God's holy Day, we waste away</L>
<L>in trifling, or in sleeping,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="008201_0009_102DD10753084C98"/>
Or else contriving how to thrive</L>
<L>in earthly Profit reaping:—</L>
<L>Our Frontier-Parts, and outer Skirts,</L>
<L>can seldom hear a Sermon;</L>
<L>Yet ah! how few among them do</L>
<L>thirst for the Dew of <HI>Hermon!</HI>—</L>
<L>How many slight true Gospel Light,</L>
<L><HI>and love Arminian-Preaching;</HI>—</L>
<L>But, can't endure the plain and pure,</L>
<L>true, faithful, Gospel-Teaching.</L>
<L>Many a Fool doth ridicule</L>
<L>strict, serious Deportment,</L>
<L>Making a scoff and laugh thereof,</L>
<L>as if no ways Important:</L>
<L>Alas! how rare is Family-Pray'r</L>
<L>in our <HI>New-English</HI> Nation;</L>
<L>But, we may see <HI>Wine, Rum</HI> and <HI>Tea,</HI></L>
<L>excessively <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Whatever is to Excess is Sin; the excessive Use there∣fore of these Articles, especially those of the <HI>former,</HI> is very displeasing to GOD.</NOTE> in Fashion;—</L>
<L>These Sins, and more I might tell o'er,</L>
<L>are spread our Country over;</L>
<L>But draw the Veil I rather will,</L>
<L>and no more Shame discover.</L>

<L>NOW therefore then, dear Countrymen,</L>
<L>since this is our Condition,</L>
<L>We surely owe for to lay low</L>
<L>in penitent Contrition:</L>
<L>O let's awake, our all's at Stake,</L>
<L>let's up and be a doing,</L>
<L>And let us strive to mend our Lives</L>
<L>before we come to Ruin:</L>
<L>O Ministers, dear Reverend Sirs,</L>
<L>with preaching Pow'r entrusted,</L>
<L>Pray lend an Ear, and what you hear</L>
<L>be not therewith disgusted;</L>
<L>O be intense, with Diligence</L>
<L>to get from <HI>Christ</HI> a Warrant,</L>
<L>That ev'ry where it may appear</L>

<L>a faithful, sound Rebuker,</L>

Whose preaching Aim is Souls to gain,</L>
<L>and not for filthy Lucre:</L>
<L>O Rulers, ye of each Degree,</L>
<L>I solemnly address you,</L>
<L>Hear my Advice, I wish You Peace</L>
<L>and pray the Lord to bless You;</L>
<L>O lay aside Excess, and Pride,</L>
<L>Your latter End consider,</L>
<L>Judge righteously, and hear the Cry</L>
<L>of Fatherless, and Widow;</L>
<L>And see that Ye Examples be</L>
<L>to every lower Station,</L>
<L>That Family Pray'r, put in Repair</L>
<L>may be, throughout the Nation;</L>
<L>And likewise when you do a Man</L>
<L>entrust with a Commission,</L>
<L>Pray let it be one whom you see</L>
<L>to be a sober Christian:—</L>
<L>And likewise all, both great and small,</L>
<L>who guilty are of Evil,</L>
<L>Let's Mourn to see how greatly we</L>
<L>have gratify'd the Devil;</L>
<L>Let's lay to Heart our better Part,</L>
<L>our latter End remember,</L>

And then may we expect that He</L>
<L>in us will be delighted;—</L>
<L>Let Men renounce the Tipling-House;</L>
<L>let Frolicking be loathed,</L>
<L>Women lay aside the Fruits of Pride,</L>

<L>With Pow'r of Law, to keep in Awe</L>
<L>the wicked, and unruly:—</L>
