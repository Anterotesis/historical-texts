So as the Person so Stabbed or Thrust shall thereof Dye within the space of six Months then next following, altho' it cannot be proved, that the same was done of Malice Fore-thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the party so offending, shall suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</Q> They considered, That be∣sides the Direction to be fetch'd by <HI>Christian Nations,</HI> from the <HI>Judicial Laws</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> con∣cerning what is to be Esteemed a <HI>Capital Murder,</HI> Long before those Laws, there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Law of God, given unto Man∣kind Gen. IX. 6. <HI>Whoso sheds Mans Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed; for in the Image of God, made he Man:</HI> A Law Anteriour and Superiour to all <HI>Humane Laws,</HI> and forever &amp; every where in Force, whatever may be the <HI>Humane Laws.</HI> And so the Sentence proceed∣ed.</P>
<P>The Honourable Judges, that they might Extend all possible Clemency to him, fixed not the Time of his Execution until the <HI>Twenty fourth</HI> of <HI>September.</HI> In this Time, His Excellency the Governour had some occasion to consider, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might be proper to propose the Prisoner as an Object for the Queens Mercy. But upon the most Mature Deliberation with Persons of understanding, and as <HI>Mercifully</HI> disposed as any, but not for such Tender <HI>Mercies</HI> to <HI>some</HI> as would prove <HI>Cruelties</HI> to all; the Nature of the Crime appeared such, as to bring the Crimi∣nal within the Statute of Heaven, Prov. XXVIII. 17. <HI>A man that doth Violence to the
<PB N="v" REF="001626_0006_0FB3E0AD64F97058"/>
Blood of any Person, shall flee to the Pit, let no Man stay him.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Young man, before as well as after his <HI>Trial,</HI> was in such a pensive Conditi∣on, as was agreeable to one under the Expec∣tation of what was now coming upon him. And he Expressed himself upon this purpose, <HI>That he had sinned, and he deserved to suffer, and he expected it; It belonged unto him; and he should patiently submit unto it; If he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> get into good Terms with Heaven before he died, this was all that he had to be concerned about.</HI></P>
<P>In this Time, the Ministers of the Town, with all suitable Compassion and Assiduity, Visited him, and Instructed him, and Pray'd with him; and not only used more private Endeavours to prepare him for his Death but also pursued the same Intention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publickly, when he had Liberty which was readily granted him, to attend in our publick Assemblies.</P>
<P>Under these Cultivations, he was brought unto such Thoughts and Frames, and he took his opportunities to declare such Things, as the Reader will find related in the Ensuing Sermon. He also declared, That he could not without wonder now Look back on a ve∣ry odd thing in his former Life; which was, <Q>That he had abundance of Times, when only sporting with the Young man, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Murdered, let fall these words to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>I shall one day be hang'd for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me for saying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could give no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Impression; but now found
<PB N="vi" REF="001626_0007_0FB3E0AEE06C3778"/>
himself Extreamly astonished in the Accom∣plishment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Twenty fourth</HI> day of <HI>September</HI> arrived, when the poor Young man, having been first instructed with a most Pertinent and Excellent Sermon, on Psal. LI. 14. <HI>Deliver me from Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tiness, O God, Thou God of my Salvation</HI> was between the Hours of Two and Four in the Afternoon, carried unto his Execution.</P>
<P>A Minister of the Town, so far gratified the Importunity of his desire for it, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, for his Assistance in these last Minutes of his Life.</P>
<P>The Young man Express'd all the pious and proper Frames, that his best Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have wished for him; and such as I hope, were a good Harvest, of the Pains and Prayers and Tears, wherewith Good men had been Labouring for his Welfare.</P>
<P>I will single out only Two or Three Pas∣sages, of what occurr'd in the Conversation, (which could not be much) by the way.</P>
<P>The Minister asking him; <HI>With what Frame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, poor</HI> David, <HI>with what Frame, dost thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> this grievous Afternoon?</HI> He answer∣ed: <HI>I Bless the Lord, I find my Soul full of Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssion to the will of God.</HI></P>
<P>Another time, the Minister asking him, <HI>Child what shall be Reported unto your poor Fa∣ther, if the grievous Tidings of this Afternoon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sent unto him?</HI> He answered; <HI>Eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, that I Dye full of Hope of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="001626_0008_0FB3E0B0652FE9A8"/>
Another time, the Minister asking him, <HI>Is not the Terror of the Death just now before you, too hard for you?</HI> He answered, <HI>No, not at all; my Hope in the Mercy of God has overcome it.</HI></P>
<P>He also declared, <HI>That his Hope was founded in the Blood of his Great Saviour shed for him, &amp; in the Wonderful Mercy of God which allowed and invited the chief of Sinners, to plead this Blood, &amp; the Wonderful Mercy of the Saviour, who will cast out none of those that come to him: And that the Effect of this Hope in him was, Hatred of all Sin more than ever, &amp; a Desire to do all the good that was possible.</HI></P>
<P>He likewise declared, <HI>That the nearer he drew to his End, the more he grew in his Hope.</HI></P>
<P>Arriving at the Fatal Place, when the Noises produced on such occasions in the vast confluence of People, were a little over, the Minister said unto him, <Q>The desire of a Dying Man has brought me, what perhaps nothing else would have done, to be pre∣sent at this uneasy Spectacle, And now, <HI>David,</HI> you are come to those last Minutes, which must be employ'd unto the best Ad∣vantage. You have had set before you, the Nature and Desert of your <HI>Sins,</HI> and parti∣cularly of that Crime for which you are now to suffer: And the contrition of Soul, with which you are to acknowledge them. You have had the Tidings &amp; the Tenders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Admirable <HI>Saviour,</HI> who is Able and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to relieve you. You have been ad∣vised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>Place</HI> your <HI>Faith</HI> in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, &amp; then how to <HI>prove</HI> it in an
<PB N="viii" REF="001626_0009_0FB3E0B1DF140630"/>
Hatred of Sin, and a Zeal for the Service of God. What remains is, That you now Re∣new your <HI>Flight</HI> unto your <HI>Saviour;</HI> And, Oh! What a <HI>Lively Flight</HI> in a <HI>Dying Hour!</HI> And that you testifie to the People of <HI>God,</HI> who have so much desired it, the <HI>Repentance</HI> that God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you: My poor <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> I put thee over into those Gracious Hands that will save thee to the uttermost. Oh! May the Glorious Grace of God shine forth on this mournful occasion!</Q></P>
<P>He then made a short Speech unto the Peo∣ple, wherein he <HI>Justified</HI> both God and Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all that was come upon him; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all the Spectators, to beware of ungovernment <HI>Passion,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sabbath-breaking,</HI> &amp; <HI>Profane Swea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <HI>Hard Drinking,</HI> and ever doing any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be grievous to their <HI>Parents,</HI> which things, he said, had brought him to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> what he spoke at all times, was usual∣ly pertinent enough; yet he was all along, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but very <HI>few words.</HI> And so they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but <HI>few words,</HI> which he now uttered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very audible: To supply this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, That a paper, which he had given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> days before unto the Minister, might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; which was done accordingly.</P>

Tho' I had not Lodging in me a <HI>Long</HI> Ha∣tred and Malice against the Young man whom I have <HI>Murdered,</HI> nor a <HI>Long</HI> purpose of Killing him; yet my Wicked <HI>Passion</HI> was raised unto such an <HI>Heighth</HI> at the Time of the <HI>Murder,</HI> and I had so much <HI>Intention of mischief</HI> to him, tho' it was but <HI>sudden,</HI> that I freely acknowledge, <HI>I deserve to Dye for what I have done.</HI> And I would Earnestly warn all People, to beware of giving way to their <HI>Passion,</HI> and <HI>Rage,</HI> when they are provoked.

<P>And Oh, the bitterness of Soul, with which I now wish, that I had never tramp∣led on the Name of the Glorious God, by the <HI>Profane Oaths,</HI> which my wicked Mouth has utterd; and that I had never allowed my self in the Dangerous Wickedness of <HI>Drunkenness;</HI> and that I had never polluted my self with vile <HI>Unchastities.</HI> For such things my poor Soul is wounded &amp; bleeding to <HI>Death.</HI> And I cannot have <HI>Peace</HI> in my Soul, without warning and begging all the People, as they Love their own Souls, to be∣ware of such Iniquities.

<P>A Deputy Sheriff then demanded of him, <HI>whether he owned this Instrument, &amp; would have it. Look'd upon, as truly Expressing the sentiments of his Heart.</HI> He replied, with a certain Air of Alacrity, <HI>Yes, with all my Heart! Or, to that Effect.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon the Minister proceeded unto such a <HI>Prayer,</HI> as the occasion called for a <Q>Wherein after the horrid Things done in <HI>every Sin,</HI> were confessed and bewailed, the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Holy God, in all the <HI>evil</HI> that, had come, or could come upon any of us, was acknowledged, and very particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if that worst of Evils, <HI>To be left unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin,</HI> had been our Misery. It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto the case of the poor Malefactor; and, at the same time, it was deplored, That an <HI>Heart full of Murder,</HI> set us all, in some sort, on the Level with him, tho' we had not, been left unto the <HI>Capital Acts</HI> of it; where∣in the <HI>Free-Grace</HI> of Heaven was to be won∣dred
<PB N="12" REF="001626_0013_0FB3E0B8A8CD4C18"/>
at: And it was desired, That if any of us had any Malice or Hatred in his Heart against his Neighbour, such <HI>Tendencies</HI> and <HI>Approaches</HI> towards <HI>Murder,</HI> might be heartily Repented of, and Graciously Pardoned. The Divine Proclamation of a <HI>Pardon,</HI> for the chief of Sinners, was then laid hold up∣on; <HI>and the Fountain open for Sin and for Un∣cleanness,</HI> was repair'd unto. The Dying Young man was carried <HI>thither. Thanks</HI> were given to the Glorious God, for the <HI>comfortable Symptoms,</HI> which we saw, of a genuine <HI>Repentance</HI> produced in him; And that the People of God, who had with such fervent <HI>Supplications</HI> been concerned for him, had Hope that God had heard the <HI>voice of their Supplications</HI> It was importunately begg'd, That it might be found a Real, Thorough, Saving Work, and an <HI>Hope that will not make ashamed;</HI> and the several Arti∣cles of it, were particularly, and with some Importunity insisted on. The <HI>Compassion</HI> of good Men for the Young man, was expres∣sed; and it was declared, that Obedience to the Law of the Holy God, which forbad any <HI>Satisfaction to be taken for the Life of a Murderer,</HI> was that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brought on the sad Work of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Afternoon. But it was pleaded, That tho' there was no Par∣don to be had for <HI>this Life,</HI> yet the Young man might be Pardoned for a <HI>Better Life.</HI> And since there is <HI>Joy in Heaven among the Angels of God over a Repenting Sinner,</HI> it was pray'd, that this might be found such an

one, and presently fall into the Hands of good <HI>Angels</HI> Rejoycing over him, and Glo∣riously Triumphing in What <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> may fetch from Dungeons &amp; from Gibbets. And since our dear Saviour said unto a Malefactor on the Day wherein He died, that He would not only <HI>Remember him when He came in His Kingdom,</HI> but also give him to be <HI>That Day in Paradise,</HI> it was pray'd, that the Soul of this Youth, might <HI>This Day</HI> Enter into an <HI>Heavenly Place</HI> and <HI>Rest;</HI> now the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of <HI>Death compassed him,</HI> and the <HI>Pains of Hell</HI> threatned to <HI>get hold on him</HI> and he <HI>called on the Name of the Lord, O Lord, I beseech thee, Deliver my Soul!</HI> It was pray'd, That his poor Father might be supported under the Heavy Trial, if he should Live, to hear of what had befallen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his Family. And, Finally, it was pray'd, That the numerous confluence of People there, and especially the Young people, might be Effectually warned by the awful <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> before them, to shun the <HI>pathes of the De∣stroyer.</HI> &amp; not by persisting in Sin, provoke the Holy one to Leave them unto such things, as they now little imagined.</Q></P>
<P>These and some other such things, were in that prayer insisted on; which had not been here at all mention'd if the mention thereof had not been by some desired.</P>
<P>After this, the Young man himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down in the <HI>Cart,</HI> upon his <HI>Coffin,</HI> and made a short, but pertinent and pathetick <HI>prayer;</HI> confessing the demerit of his Crimes, com∣mitting
<PB N="14" REF="001626_0015_0FB3E0BBA3718068"/>
himself into the Hands of his only Saviour, and Expressing his Hope of the Mercy of God unto him.</P>
<P>He then rose up, and the Execution was proceeded in; wherein, and from the Begin∣ing, to the End he Express'd the least <HI>Reluc∣tancy,</HI> that has ordinarily been seen in Cir∣cumstances like to his; and a <HI>Desire</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> rather than an <HI>Horror</HI> of it. People at a distance, interpreted it as a sort of <HI>Stupidity;</HI> but unto them who were better acquainted with his condition, it seem'd the Effect of a better principle. There is good Ground for Hope, that the means of Good which he had enjoy'd, were not lost upon him; and that he now <HI>Sings the Righteousness</HI> and Benignity of <HI>God the Saviour,</HI> who may have <HI>delivered him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> guiltiness:</HI></P>

<P>A Most astonishing Favour of Heaven! Too little <HI>acknowledged,</HI> not near enough <HI>Celebrated,</HI> a∣mong the Sinful Chil∣dren of Men. We have <HI>many</HI> Calls to take a thankful Notice of a Mercy, wherein we are so highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avoured; Very <HI>mighty</HI> Calls, when we see what horrid and bloody <HI>Sin,</HI> some of our

Brethren are Left unto; What fear∣ful <HI>Ruine</HI> some have brought upon themselves, by the <HI>Sin</HI> which they have been Left unto. 'Tis what the Lamentable Object we have now be∣fore us doth very Loudly Call us to; 'tis the most <HI>proper Use</HI> to be made of such a Spectacle!</P>
<P>It is a strange Occurrence that my Text refers unto. The Father of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> once and again falling into the Errors of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> His Life was filled with <HI>Trials;</HI> But in them all, the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of the Glorious God unto His Promises, was marvellously illustra∣ted. The Blessed God, had once and again promised, That He would be a <HI>God</HI> unto the Offspring of <HI>Abraham.</HI> And yet this famous Patriarch, did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and again after some sort Alie∣nate the <HI>Promises,</HI> and by his own Act, exposed his Wife to such Hazards, that he had lost the Fulfilment of the <HI>Pro∣mises,</HI> if God had not in a way of <HI>So∣vereign Grace</HI> marvellously stept in for his Deliverance. Formerly in the
<PB N="3" REF="001626_0019_0FB3E0C2742EEEB8"/>
Court of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and now in the Court of <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rar,</HI> our Patriarch dissembled his Relation to his Wife, apprehending that his Life might be in danger among so debauch'd a people, if it had been known, how he was related unto her▪ It is not now a <HI>Time,</HI> nor is it here a <HI>Place,</HI> to declare at large, the Judg∣ment which the Ancients, as well as the Moderns, have passed upon this Action of <HI>Abraham;</HI> an Action Look∣ing so like a prostitution; how severe∣ly some have <HI>Condemned</HI> it, how plau∣sibly some have <HI>Defended</HI> it.

dealing,</HI> as he should have done. The Compassion of God unto His Poor, Frail, Distressed Servant on this occa∣sion was wonderful! Had the Inten∣tion of <HI>Abimelek</HI> to Marry this Lady, been accomplished, he had been plun∣ged into a Criminal <HI>Adultery;</HI> A Crime whereof, as much a <HI>Pagan</HI> as he was, he yet own'd, <HI>It would have been a Great Sin upon him, and upon his Government.</HI> But while the Sin was yet only intended, and under the al∣leviating Circumstance of, <HI>A mistake of the Person</HI> too, God smote <HI>Abime∣lek</HI> with a Fit of Illness, and his <HI>Court</HI> also with <HI>Plagues</HI> which had in them something Extraordinary. While he was in much concern about these things, God in a <HI>Dream</HI> informed him of the <HI>Cause</HI> why these <HI>Plagues</HI> were come, &amp; of the way to remove them. In the XXXIII Chapter of <HI>Job,</HI> you have a large Paragraph, concerning a <HI>Dream</HI> wherein <HI>God withdraws a man from his purpose;</HI> And I suspect, that this His∣tory of <HI>Abimelek</HI> might be therein re∣ferr'd
<PB N="5" REF="001626_0021_0FB3E0C56B88F560"/>
unto. The only Clause of the History, now to be insisted on, is, that Passage in the Speech of God, unto the <HI>Awakened Soul</HI> of the Prince now in a <HI>Dream,</HI> wherein He <HI>spoke once, yea, twice unto him;</HI> He says, <HI>I with-held thee from Sinning against me.</HI> It is men∣tioned as a Singular <HI>Kindnss,</HI> a Speci∣al <HI>Kindness</HI> of God unto him. The <HI>Trouble</HI> that he suffered, was it seems a vast <HI>Kindness,</HI> in that it <HI>with-held him from Sinning,</HI> against the Glorious God▪ It was, as <HI>Elihu</HI> speaks, in the Text I told you of, <HI>To keep back his Soul from the Pit, and his Life from perishing by the Sword.</HI></P>
<P>The DOCTRINE then before us, will be this;</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>The most Gracious God, in an excellent manner displays his Grace towards the Sinful Children of Men, in with-hold∣ing them from Sinning against him.</HEAD>
<P>To be <HI>preserved from Sin,</HI> 'tis to en∣joy
<PB N="6" REF="001626_0022_0FB3E0C6E4ADB988"/>
a preservation, that, my Brethren, we cannot be too Thankful for.</P>
<P>Two things now demand a most af∣fectionate Consideration with us; First the <HI>Method,</HI> and then the <HI>Mercy,</HI> of this Happiness, <HI>I with-held thee from Sin∣ning against me.</HI></P>
<P>I. The <HI>Method</HI> of our Good God, in <HI>With-holding us from Sinning against him;</HI> This is various, and curious, and has many Wonders in it. We will take the Surprizing Subject into our Con∣templation.</P>
<P>First; Our Good God <HI>With-holds</HI> the <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Occasions</HI> of <HI>Sin;</HI> This is one <HI>Method</HI> in which <HI>He with∣holds us from Sinning against him</HI> There is an Army of <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> united un∣der one Leader, for which cause they all go under the single Name of, <HI>Sa∣ran,</HI> or, <HI>The Devil.</HI> The Design of these <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> is to Tempt us unto <HI>Sin,</HI> that so they may by their <HI>Temptations</HI> bring us under <HI>their Condemnation.</HI> Our <HI>Tempter,</HI> the <HI>Devil, goes about,</HI> seeking
<PB N="7" REF="001626_0023_0FB3E0C865891D98"/>
whom he may Deceive into Sin, &amp; by Deceiving <HI>Devour</HI> them. As our Lord said, Luk. XXII. 31. <HI>Simon, Simon, Sa∣tan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you:</HI> So may it more or less be said, about every man in the World; <HI>Sinner, Sinner, Satan the Tempter hath desired, that he may have thee, to Tempt thee unto some undoing Wickedness.</HI> In∣deed <HI>Satan</HI> must have the permission of God for it, before he can fall upon us. But now our God very often does not permit <HI>Satan,</HI> to Tempt us with such Fury, and such Success, as he would otherwise assault us withal. Our God has the Tempter in a <HI>Chain;</HI> He holds in the <HI>Ty-'Dog.</HI> He <HI>with∣holds</HI> the <HI>Tempter</HI> from Ensnaring of us, and thereby He <HI>witholds</HI> us from falling into the <HI>Snare of the Wicked.</HI> There are <HI>People set upon mischief.</HI> 'Tis very strange that they do no more. 'Tis because God <HI>Chains up the Devil,</HI> and won't let him suggest unto them, what they may do. Our <HI>Indians</HI> had else done a thousand times more mischief,
<PB N="8" REF="001626_0024_0FB3E0CAFA27F468"/>
than they have, to our Plantations. This <HI>World</HI> is also full of those Things, which are the <HI>Occasions,</HI> the <HI>Incentives,</HI> the <HI>Inducements</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> The <HI>Stumbling Block: of Iniquity</HI> do even fill the World. But our God <HI>with-holds us from Sin,</HI> by <HI>with-holding</HI> from us, those things that would <HI>provoke</HI> us to Sin. He takes the <HI>Stumbling-blocks</HI> out of our way, &amp; <HI>so witholds</HI> us from Falling into Sin upon them. Our God <HI>witholds</HI> us from the exorbitant Out-breakings of the <HI>Lust of the Flesh,</HI> and the <HI>Lust of the Eye,</HI> and the <HI>Pride of Life,</HI> by <HI>with∣holding</HI> from us the Objects, that are the <HI>Fuel</HI> of them. We say, <HI>'Tis oppor∣tunity that makes a Thief.</HI> Our God <HI>witholds</HI> many a man from many a <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t</HI> &amp; other Sins by this; He won't give him an <HI>Opportunity.</HI> He won't give <HI>Riches</HI> to one man; and so the man is <HI>witheld</HI> from the <HI>Denying of God.</HI> He won't pinch another man with <HI>Poverty;</HI> and so the man is <HI>witheld</HI> from <HI>Taking the Name of God in vain.</HI> If God should order for man, some, <HI>Conditions,</HI> &amp; some
<PB N="9" REF="001626_0025_0FB3E0CC2526C9B8"/>
<HI>Employments,</HI> &amp; some <HI>Companions,</HI> which He <HI>witholds</HI> from them, Verily, they would be drawn into abundance of Sin, more than they are.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Diverting</HI> of us from Sin, by the Good Hand of God, this is one <HI>Method</HI> used by our Good God in <HI>witholding</HI> us from Sin. We should Sin more than we do, but our God <HI>witholds</HI> us, by finding something else for us to do. One gave this agreea∣ble Account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how he kept his Inno∣cency; <HI>The Devil don't find me at Lie∣sure, to do what he would have me to do.</HI> Infuriated <HI>Saul</HI> would have Embrued his hands in the Blood of a Servant of God, but <HI>God call'd him off!</HI> We read, 1 Sam. XXIII. 27. <HI>There came a Mes∣senger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come away:</HI>—You know for what. Many such a <HI>Messenger</HI> comes unto us from God, that calls us another way, when we are just upon some sinful perpetrations. The <HI>Flood</HI> seems to have been as notable, as General, an Example of this Observation. The
<PB N="10" REF="001626_0026_0FB3E0CDAC287180"/>
<HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>Flood,</HI> is in this turn'd in∣to a <HI>Blessing</HI> on the World. The more fructifying mould of the Earth, has been so damnified by the <HI>Flood,</HI> that men live now with more Difficulty than they did before. No man that knows the Heart of man, will deny, that a <HI>Flood of Wickedness</HI> is prevented in the World, by mens being so ne∣cessarily taken up how to Live in the World. What <HI>infinite Wickedness</HI> would men be hatching every where, if they had nothing else to do! If the World had nothing but <HI>Fruitful Plains</HI> in it, it would soon be an Entire <HI>Sodom,</HI> and fit for nothing but a <HI>Conflagration.</HI> In∣deed our God <HI>witholds</HI> us from <HI>Sin,</HI> when he <HI>Compels</HI> us to <HI>Work.</HI> For the most part, our God plunges us into such indigent Circumstances, that the most of our <HI>Thought,</HI> and our <HI>Time,</HI> goes to the <HI>Earning of our Bread.</HI> By Engaging us in our daily <HI>Occupati∣ons,</HI> without which we and our Fa∣milies would starve, Our God <HI>with∣holds us from Sinning against Him.</HI> And
<PB N="11" REF="001626_0027_0FB3E0CF25531590"/>
sometimes when our <HI>Vocations</HI> are not enough to Engross our Care, and <HI>withold us from Sin,</HI> our <HI>Vexations</HI> must; God finds out for us <HI>Vexati∣ons</HI> that shall. One man is hamper∣ed with such a <HI>Malady;</HI> another man is Embroiled with such an <HI>Enemy;</HI> a third man is taken up with such an <HI>Inconvenience.</HI> Why so; The Voice of the All-wise God unto us in these things is, <HI>Thus I witheld thee from Sinning against me!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; <HI>Interest, Interest;</HI> That is a Surprising <HI>Method</HI> of God; That is a strong sort of a <HI>Curb,</HI> where∣with our God <HI>Witholds us from Sin∣ning against Him.</HI> The Metal which the <HI>Curb</HI> is usually made of, is well known in the World. We say, <HI>In∣terest will not Ly;</HI> tho' it will often make men do it. Every man is <HI>True</HI> to that, which he takes to be his <HI>In∣terest.</HI> This is a most Exquisite <HI>Poli∣cy of Heaven,</HI> as I may call it, in the Government of the World. <HI>Humane Society,</HI> would be Damaged, yea, Dis∣banded,
<PB N="12" REF="001626_0028_0FB3E0D0A4DF7FB8"/>
if some Sins were not become very <HI>odious,</HI> which yet men are natu∣rally enough prone unto; It is <HI>Interest</HI> that has made them <HI>Odious;</HI> men feel 'tis for their <HI>Interest</HI> that they should be so. God makes the Transgressors feel that word; Hab. II. 9, 10. <HI>Wo to him that Coveteth an Evil Covetousness; Thou hast consulted shame to thy self.</HI> God makes men see, that by such and such Sins, they shall bring a Mischief on themselves; This <HI>witholds them from Sinning against Him!</HI> There is a De∣testable Generation of men, who go under the Name of <HI>Deists.</HI> These Dangerous Wretches pretend unto a kind of <HI>Moral Vertue;</HI> Their <HI>Moral Vertue</HI> is this; A man expects the <HI>Ci∣vilities</HI> of his Neighbours; his Condi∣tion would be insupportable should his Neighbours count him unworthy of their <HI>Civilities.</HI> Now, that a man may not Lose the <HI>Civilities</HI> of others, he must then treat them with <HI>Civilities.</HI> These are all the <HI>Bonds of a Good Be∣haviour,</HI> that these Baptised Infidels
<PB N="13" REF="001626_0029_0FB3E0D3AD483960"/>
are sensible of. This is all, that keeps the Dangerous <HI>Monsters,</HI> from Steal∣ing, and Lying, and Murder. Our God <HI>witholds men from Sin,</HI> by making them see, that their Neighbours will else <HI>withold</HI> their <HI>Civilities</HI> from them▪ Tis the Hope of <HI>Gain,</HI> by their show of some <HI>Godliness,</HI> that witholds many men from the Grossest Efforts of <HI>Un∣godliness.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. There is the Method of <HI>Conscience;</HI> Our God <HI>witholds us from Sin,</HI> by the Controul of <HI>Conscience,</HI> which He has placed as His <HI>Deputy</HI> in our Souls. Men durst not Sin as they would, because of what the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> shows unto them; they can't Sin except they <HI>put</HI> out <HI>this Candle.</HI> A <HI>Conscience</HI> which tells them, That they who <HI>do such things are worthy of Death;</HI> The <HI>Conscience</HI> which causes a Wicked man, to do what no <HI>other man</HI> could bring him to; Act. XXIV. 25. <HI>To Trem∣ble</HI> at the Thoughts of a <HI>Judgment to come.</HI> That stands in the way of ma∣ny a man, like an <HI>Angel</HI> with a Fla∣ming
<PB N="14" REF="001626_0030_0FB3E0D527D50968"/>
Sword, and stops him, when his <HI>Way is perverse before the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And our God, by ordering a <HI>Good Education</HI> for us, keeps our <HI>Conscience</HI> in a more <HI>Wakeful</HI> and <HI>Active</HI> Plight; so that we cannot get over the <HI>Checks</HI> which it gives unto us. This <HI>Light within,</HI> tho' it be so darkened that it is not a <HI>sufficient Guide unto Life,</HI> yet it shows us, many <HI>Fair</HI> Things, and like a <HI>Fire</HI> it scalds us if we do any <HI>Foul</HI> ones. The Supream Governour of the World holds the World in order by this <HI>Golden Engine,</HI> &amp; <HI>witholds</HI> men from very much of the Disorder which else they would rush into. Many a man would Murder his Parents, De∣stroy his own Wife, Debauch his Neighbours, Blaspheme God, Burn down the Town, and run a muck a∣mong the people, if some <HI>Conscience</HI> did not <HI>withold men from Sinning</HI> at such a rate of Outrageous Madness. The men who proclaim it, that they have shaken off the Regards of <HI>Con∣science,</HI> and suppressed &amp; smothered

<P>Fifthly, and Finally. I can <HI>show you a more Excellent Way,</HI> than all of this. There are those whom a Good God <HI>Witholds from Sin,</HI> by infusing in∣to their Souls a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> which is contrary to <HI>Sin;</HI> A <HI>Principle</HI> under the power whereof, men <HI>cannot Sin</HI> like other men. A <HI>Principle</HI> of Piety does God shower down from Heaven, into the Souls of some; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Principle</HI> of Respect unto all the <HI>Holy and Just and Good</HI> Laws of Heaven. By such a <HI>Principle</HI> the Dispositions to <HI>Sin</HI> in the Hearts of Good men are <HI>Mortified;</HI> &amp; the <HI>Considerations</HI> which deter from Sin, are Entertained, with a most Lively Efficacy. Under the force of such a <HI>Principle,</HI> a man can∣not but hate <HI>Sin,</HI> and Loath <HI>Sin,</HI> and refuse to <HI>Sin;</HI> and if he be pressed unto: Sin, he will say, Gen.

<P>II. The <HI>Mercy</HI> of our Good God, in thus <HI>Witholding us from Sinning against Him;</HI> This is what we are to won∣der at; and what exceedingly bespeaks our <HI>Praises</HI> unto Him. This will ap∣pear immediately. For,</P>
<P>First. We shall fall into <HI>Sin,</HI> yea, into <HI>all manner of Sin and Blasphemy,</HI> and such as would never be <HI>Forgiven</HI> too; if our God <HI>Withold</HI> us not. We are every one of us Depraved with <HI>Original Sin;</HI> and this our <HI>Original Sin</HI> is the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Every Sin;</HI> it contains in it a <HI>propensity</HI> to <HI>every Sin.</HI> We must every one of us all confess, <HI>Behold, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hapon in Iniquity.</HI> We must every one of us make that Con∣fession,
<PB N="17" REF="001626_0033_0FB3E0D9A276B548"/>
<HI>The whole Imagination of our Heart is only Evil continually.</HI> Our <HI>First Pa∣rents</HI> whom God justly made the <HI>Repre∣sentatives</HI> of all Mankind, were made <HI>Mutable.</HI> And it was no unjust Thing in the Sovereign One to make them so: <HI>Immutability</HI> is the Prerogative of none but the Infinite GOD. These our Pa∣rents, abused their own <HI>Liberty,</HI> and brought upon themselves a most Sinful <HI>Pravity;</HI> which cannot but be derived now unto us their Unhappy Children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>A Seed of Evil Doers, Children that are Corrupters!</HI> We are born with <HI>Hearts</HI> whereof we read, Matt. XV. 19. There <HI>proceed out of them, Evil Thoughts, Mur∣ders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, False witness, Blasphemies.</HI> There is no <HI>Heart</HI> among us, but if God should not <HI>withold</HI> it, rapid streams of <HI>Sin</HI> would burst from it, and whole Torrents of I∣niquity. Bring in a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of all the <HI>Crying Sins</HI> found any where among the Children of men, there is no <HI>Heart</HI> a∣mong us, but what would soon carry us into the worst of them all, if God <HI>With∣held</HI> us not. And if God should allow <HI>Satan</HI> to fill this Heart, an <HI>Heart</HI> that is of it self so <HI>desperately wicked,</HI> no man alive can imagine to how a <HI>desperate</HI> a

Degree of <HI>Wickedness</HI> we should be car∣ried, and with how vehement an Impe∣tuosity! An <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> not forbidden by God, will go forth, and <HI>perswade</HI> an <HI>Aha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>prevail also,</HI> to any thing in the World. If God should not <HI>With∣hold</HI> our Adversary from hurting of us, his <HI>Devices</HI> would soon be too cunning for us: The <HI>Charms</HI> and <HI>Chains</HI> of Hell would soon bring the last Confusion up∣on us.</P>
<P>Secondly. We are very <HI>Unworthy</HI> that God should <HI>withold us from Sinning against Him;</HI> our <HI>Frequent Sinning</HI> has Left us in the greatest <HI>Unworthiness</HI> of such a <HI>Mercy!</HI> By our <HI>former Sins,</HI> we deserve to be left unto <HI>further Sins.</HI> The <HI>punishment of Sin with Sin,</HI> is no un∣common proceedure in the tremendous Dispensations of God.

<P>I. There are some <HI>Occurrences</HI> in the World, that are very much to be <HI>won∣dred
<PB N="21" REF="001626_0037_0FB3E0E0080DA928"/>
at;</HI> But we now see the <HI>Reason</HI> of those <HI>Wondrous Occurrences.</HI> I will en∣tertain you with the Mention of Two or Three Things, whereof we must now say, <HI>These are the Doings of the Lord, and they are marvellous in our eyes.</HI> If there were not a Good God, who <HI>witholds men from Sinning against Him,</HI> the World would not have such a Res∣pite from such <HI>Wonderful Miseries,</HI> which I shall now tell you of.</P>
<P>First. We may <HI>Wonder</HI> that some <HI>Destructive Wickednesses</HI> are not ever now and then done in the World, by people that are <HI>Wicked</HI> enough to do them. There are people, who have <HI>nothing within</HI> them, to <HI>withold</HI> them, from such Things as are too horrible to be spoken of. People there are, who would <HI>Stick at nothing,</HI> that they could see themselves <HI>able to do,</HI> that they may ruine <HI>others,</HI> and <HI>Enrich</HI> themselves. People there are, who if it came into their Minds, what they are <HI>capable</HI> of doing, and yet might Ly <HI>Concealed</HI> af∣ter all, and it may be <HI>Roast their own Eggs</HI> into the Bargain, would soon be the Actors of direful Tragedies! Many an <HI>honest man,</HI> is aware of Wayes to do incredible Mischief, which if some
<PB N="22" REF="001626_0038_0FB3E0E12450B508"/>
<HI>Wicked</HI> men should be as much aware of, they would be more perilous Crea∣tures, than the <HI>Dragon</HI> of <HI>Hetruria,</HI> whereof <HI>Dion</HI> tells us, that after he had made fearful Devastations, he was kil∣led with a Thunderbolt. The men are <HI>Devils,</HI> and very cunning and subtil <HI>De∣vils</HI> too; but they have <HI>Chains of Dark∣ness</HI> upon them. They don't <HI>see</HI> what they can do: And would if they saw it. Prudence will direct, that I should not go too far in Explaining my self.—But this I may say; There are People that would make a very Light matter of a <HI>Perjury;</HI> they would make nothing for a small matter to <HI>Forswear</HI> themselves. Tis a <HI>wonder,</HI> that no <HI>more Naboths</HI> are Sworn out of their Lives, or at least out of their <HI>Vineyards,</HI> by them that have <HI>no Yoke</HI> upon them. Tis very strange! And so is another thing, that I will ven∣ture to speak of. He that is willing to throw away his <HI>own Life,</HI> may easily be master of <HI>Another mans.</HI> And yet, you have known many people set upon throwing away their <HI>own Lives.</HI> But you scarce ever knew one of these des∣perate Suicides disposed unto the killing of any besides themselves. What is the <HI>Reason</HI> of this? Our Good God has
<PB N="23" REF="001626_0039_0FB3E0E2A6BC7D18"/>
acquainted us; <HI>I witheld them!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. We may <HI>wonder,</HI> That this World is not an entire <HI>Acelde∣ma,</HI> and that it Swims not with <HI>Blood,</HI> even up to the <HI>Horse-bridles.</HI> There are cursed <HI>Fires</HI> Latent in the Souls of men; <HI>Fires</HI> that have some∣times broke out, and burnt all round about, burnt unto the very Foundati∣ons of the Mountains, burn't down all before them. A very Little Thing will serve sometimes, to blow up these <HI>Fires; Maxima odia ex Levissimis cau∣sis!</HI> And then a whole Nation becomes a formidable <HI>Volcano;</HI> no more habi∣table than a <HI>Vesuvie.</HI> Our Apostle speaks, as if every man had the Heart of a <HI>Murderer</HI> in him; and Rom. III. 15, 16. <HI>Feet swift to shed Blood; De∣struction and Misery in their wayes.</HI> We see some Commit bloody <HI>Mur∣ders.</HI> Why don't they grow as com∣mon, as they did a little before the Final Catastrophe on <HI>Jerusalem!</HI> The Venemous Hearts of Men, have in them the Root, which all <HI>Murders</HI> grow upon. Sometimes a <HI>Cup</HI> of poi∣son to be trembled at, has been put into the Hands of Nations; Then the Intoxicated Nations have run mad;
<PB N="24" REF="001626_0040_0FB3E0E500E26120"/>
have been furiously set upon destroying one another; have sheathed their Swords in one anothers bowels, with a Rage that has reached up to Heaven. The <HI>Passions</HI> have been of old called; <HI>The wild beasts of the Soul.</HI> if those <HI>Wild Beasts</HI> are once let loose, they make fearful Depredations▪ they turn <HI>Populous. Regions</HI> into a <HI>Wilderness!</HI> When a <HI>Kingdom is divided against it self,</HI> what <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nyes,</HI> what <HI>Opiates</HI> are they, that keep under the worst of all <HI>Phrensies,</HI> that would soon bring all to Desolation! When Distracted People think themselves oppressed, what is it that keeps under the <HI>Massanello's,</HI> or keeps things in the <HI>Calm,</HI> which tis said, the <HI>French Salvages</HI> told a greater than themseves, was the thing which of all they had seen, they most admired at? Who is it that <HI>Stills the Noise of the Seas, and the Tumult of the People?</HI> Our Good God has acquainted us with the <HI>Reason</HI> of this; <HI>I witheld them!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. We may <HI>wonder,</HI> That there is any <HI>True People of God</HI> Left in the World; and that the <HI>Burning Bush</HI> is not <HI>Consumed.</HI> Our Lord-Redeemer has thro' all Ages, a <HI>Church</HI> visibly Ex∣isting on the Face of the Earth; His <HI>Wil∣ling,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="001626_0041_0FB3E0E6684DEAB8"/>
and His <HI>Holy</HI> People. <HI>The Genera∣tion of them that seek Him:</HI> A Genera∣tion which <HI>Condemns the World,</HI> and Offends it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, and must not <HI>marvel,</HI> if it be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the World Satan,</HI> who is the <HI>God of this World,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit that works in the Chil∣dren of Disobedience,</HI> fills his Children with an implacable Aversion and An∣tipathy for this People of God. They will grant not only <HI>Liberties,</HI> but al∣so <HI>Preferments,</HI> to <HI>Devils Incarnate</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yea, tho' they may differ very much among one another. But they will turn every Stone, that the Children of God may be <HI>Discouraged,</HI> and even <HI>Exterminated.</HI> The Persecution of <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI> has been in all Ages carried on; Always with most Unreasonable Barbarities, and sometimes, to an Ex∣tremity of cruel Dissipations; even such an Extremity, that the <HI>Dioclesi∣ans</HI> on the <HI>Thrones of Iniquity,</HI> have boasted, of a, <HI>Superstitione Christiana de∣leta;</HI> That there was no more <HI>Chris∣tianity</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eft in the World. But still the Church of our Lord, Our-lives the Attempts of all its Adversaries, yea, gains ground, grows great, &amp; improves by those Attempts; and having <HI>Ob∣tained
<PB N="26" REF="001626_0042_0FB3E0E7F7A97360"/>
Help from God, it continues to this Day.</HI> The Song of the Church in all Ages hath been that; Psa. LXXVI. 10. <HI>Surely, The wrath of man shall praise thee, the Remainder of that Wrath shalt thou Restrain.</HI> We can hardly tell whence it is, That tho' the <HI>Wolves</HI> bring forth many more at a Littter, than the Sheep; and we seldom hear of a <HI>Wolf</HI> kill'd, when the <HI>Sheep</HI> is e∣very day Led into the <HI>Shambles;</HI> yet there are a thousand times more <HI>Sheep</HI> known in the World than there are of those ravening Devourers. But I now propound a much stranger thing than this. The Faithful People of God, are <HI>Counted like sheep for the slaughter all the Day long.</HI> They are but a <HI>Little Flock,</HI> a very <HI>Little Little Flock;</HI> The <HI>Wolves,</HI> they, as it was of Old said about a <HI>Syri∣an</HI> Herd of them, <HI>Fill the Country.</HI> Now, Whence is it, that the Church is not <HI>ut∣terly cut off;</HI> &amp; the Name of it, <HI>no more had in Remembrance!</HI> Why have no Dayes of <HI>Purim,</HI> and of <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> nor <HI>Irish</HI> Massacres totally Extinguished it? Our Good God has acquainted us with the <HI>Reason</HI> of it; <HI>I witheld them.</HI> Oh! Let us now Give to our Good God, the Glory of such <HI>Wonderful</HI> Dispensations.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001626_0043_0FB3E0E969A47DF0"/>
II. A Lesson of Wondrous <HI>Thankful∣ness</HI> is to be now taught unto those, whom God has <HI>Witheld from Sinning</HI> a∣gainst Him. Sirs, You are <HI>Thankful,</HI> no doubt, that you have been <HI>Witheld</HI> from Things that would have brought <HI>Sicknes∣ses</HI> upon you, or Things that would have wounded you with incureable <HI>Reproach∣es;</HI> That you have been <HI>Witheld</HI> from <HI>Wants</HI> and <HI>Straits,</HI> by which your <HI>Lives</HI> would have been Embittered; That you have been <HI>Witheld</HI> from <HI>grievous Deaths,</HI> by frightful Accidents which have threat∣ened them. You are very much to Blame, if you are not very <HI>Thankful</HI> for such Deliverances; <HI>Unholy,</HI> if <HI>Unthank∣ful!</HI> But are you <HI>Thankful</HI> that you have been <HI>Witheld from Sinning</HI> against the Glorious GOD? This, O Redeemed Ones, This is a greater Cause for <HI>Thanks∣giving,</HI> than any of the rest. It may be, some of you have been all your Dayes hitherto upheld, and <HI>witheld</HI> from doing any Thing, of a <HI>Scandalous</HI> Aspect; Like the Young man in the Gospel, You have been <HI>kept from your Youth up,</HI> from every Thing that may be called, <HI>Scandalous.</HI> Oh! Be very Thankful, for so rare a <HI>Mercy;</HI> so rich a <HI>Mercy!</HI> Or, if not so,
<PB N="28" REF="001626_0044_0FB3E0EAE211CD40"/>
yet you have been <HI>witheld</HI> from such <HI>Scandals</HI> as you have seen <HI>Others</HI> fall in∣to. God has not Left you to make your selves <HI>Prodigies</HI> of Sin; God has not hang'd you up in Chains, among the <HI>Mo∣numents of his Wrath;</HI> Others no worse by Nature than you, have been so. E∣ven in <HI>This,</HI> you have Ground of <HI>Thank∣fulness.</HI> Tis a <HI>Mercy</HI> of God; And a meer <HI>Mercy</HI> it is! Yea, My Hearers, I believe there are very few of you, but what may call to mind, that you have been at some Time or other, just upon the point of doing some very <HI>horrible Thing!</HI> You have been very violently push'd on, to do some <HI>horrible Thing,</HI> which if it had been <HI>done,</HI> you had been the most <HI>Undone</HI> Things in the World; <HI>Undone for Both Worlds!</HI> You may make that Report; Psal. LXXIII. 2. <HI>As for me, my Feet were almost gone, my steps had will-nigh, slipt.</HI> But God stept in, and saved you. O fall down before the Lord, and thankfully admire so obliging a <HI>Mer∣cy;</HI> and say, <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul; I bless thee, O my God, for thou hast deli∣vered my Soul, in delivering my Feet from the Falls I have been so near unto!</HI></P>
<P>I will make Two Remarks on the Gratitude which is now called for. The
<PB N="29" REF="001626_0045_0FB3E0EC603D18F8"/>
One is this; In this thing it may so fall out, that you may give a shining Demonstration of your <HI>Sincerity</HI> before the Lord. It may be, 'tis by some sore and sharp <HI>Affliction</HI> upon you, that God has <HI>Witheld you from Sinning against Him.</HI> Well, Can you now so far heartily give Thanks to God for this <HI>Affliction;</HI> and can you heartily say, <HI>Lord, I bless thee, that thou woul∣dest rather, bind me in Affliction and Iron, and bring down my Heart with Labour, then let me run Loose in the broad way that Leads unto Destruction!</HI> He was a Saint of God, who could say; Psal. CXIX. 67, 71. <HI>Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I have kept thy Word. It is good for me, that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy Statutes.</HI> O Thou Sin-hating Soul; This would be a mark of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> that would have no less than on <HI>Evi∣dent Token of Salvation</HI> in it. The O∣ther is this; You must not fall into a Dream, that a <HI>Negative Religion,</HI> will be enough to secure your Blessed∣ness. Many men, because they have been <HI>Witheld</HI> from such Things as ma∣ny others are chargeable withal, they fancy they have <HI>Religion</HI> enough. They
<PB N="30" REF="001626_0046_0FB3E0EDE7D5E428"/>
can say, <HI>I am not as other men, or as this Publican,</HI> and they fancy here is <HI>Religion</HI> enough to put them in Good Terms with Heaven. A very Grand Mistake! You read; Matth. III. 10. <HI>E∣very Tree that brings not forth Good Fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the Fire.</HI> Tis not enough, that you <HI>bring not forth Evil Fruit;</HI> You must <HI>bring forth Good Fruit;</HI> and by a Regenera∣ting Work of God upon you, be made <HI>Good Trees</HI> in order to it; You must not only be <HI>Witholden</HI> from <HI>Sin,</HI> but also be <HI>Converted</HI> from <HI>Sin;</HI> else you go into a <HI>Fire</HI> to be trembled at! Not only <HI>Sins of Commission,</HI> but also <HI>Sins of Omission,</HI> will expose you to it.</P>
<P>III. Certainly, it becomes us to do what we can, that <HI>Others</HI> as well as <HI>Our selves,</HI> may be <HI>Witheld</HI> from <HI>Sinning</HI> a∣gainst the Glorious God. This is very plain; If the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God be great, in <HI>Witholding men from Sinning</HI> against Him, Then they who Seduce or Invite others to Sin, are the worst <HI>Enemies</HI> they can have in the world. Yea, 'tis a <HI>Mercy</HI> to be <HI>Delivered from such Unreasonable men;</HI> to be kept out of the <HI>Paths</HI> of such <HI>De∣stroyers!</HI> I will first say this; <HI>My Son,
<PB N="31" REF="001626_0047_0FB3E0F0226B91B8"/>
If Sinners Entice thee</HI> to be and to do like themselves, Oh! <HI>Consent thou not;</HI> Fly from them, as thou wouldest from the worst of <HI>Enemies; Make no Friend∣ship</HI> with them, lest thou <HI>Get a snare to thy Soul.</HI> But O you, <HI>Enticers,</HI> what will be your Doom from God? <HI>What shall be given to you, or what shall be done to you,</HI> or, What shall be said of you. O ye <HI>Mischievous</HI> Ones? An Apostle of God once fixing his Eyes on one of your Tribe, said, <HI>O Full of all Mischief, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Child of the Devil!</HI> Were such a Man of God now to speak, he would surely tell you, Wretches, The <HI>Devil</HI> is your <HI>Fa∣ther;</HI> you do his <HI>work.</HI> You shall be punished with your <HI>Father,</HI> and they who will Curse the Day th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ever they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you, will give a dread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Aggravation</HI> to your punishment. On the other side; Shall not we do what we can, to <HI>With<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld Others</HI> from <HI>Sin?</HI> Tis <HI>God-like:</HI> A most amiable Imitation of <HI>God;</HI> And, Oh! how acceptable to the Holy Lord! But what shall be done? <HI>Publick Officers</HI> may do very much in the Execution of their <HI>Offices.</HI> These are <HI>Masters of Re∣straint.</HI> And Oh! that all such would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves to think, <HI>What may I do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin may be more discountenanced?</HI>

God forbid, they should fall under that Blame, <HI>They have overpassed the Deeds of the Wicked.</HI> But <HI>Private Christians</HI> may also do much by their Faithful and Lo∣ving Admonitions. Oh! Let us Call upon one another, &amp; <HI>Exhort one another daily, lest any be hardened, thro' the De∣ceitfulness of Sin.</HI> Our Warrant, it is unquestionable; Lev. XIX. 17. <HI>Thou shalt Rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer Sin upon him.</HI> And, if we all owe this Duty to one another,; if none but the Children of <HI>Gain</HI> will say, <HI>Am I my Bro∣thers keeper?

Be concer∣ned for them.

their Good Manners.</HI> Have you forgot the Vengeance of God, on the House of <HI>Eli,</HI> when his <HI>Children made themselves Vile, and he Restrained them not!</HI> If they do any <HI>Vile Things,</HI> from which you can <HI>Withold</HI> them, Verily, you make their Guilt your own; and be it known to you, God will do such Things upon both of you, as your <HI>Ears</HI> might well <HI>tingle at the hearing of.</HI> I will now say but this; If the Children must go on as <HI>Children left unto themselves,</HI> and you will not <HI>Withold</HI> them, they will bring you to <HI>Shame,</HI> and themselves to <HI>Hell,</HI> and your Indulgence that will not allow you to make them sensible, that it is <HI>an Evil Thing and a Bitter,</HI> to Sin against God, will be found, <HI>Bitterness in the Latter End.</HI></P>
<P>IV. But what if we have not been <HI>Witheld from Sinning</HI> against the Holy God, who <HI>is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil,</HI> and who <HI>cannot Look upon Iniqui∣ty?</HI> On! Let us then mourn exceeding∣ly before the Lord, and not withold our Tears upon on Occasion so very deplora∣ble!

and heinously, perhaps <HI>notoriously</HI> Miscarried, in our Time What shall we now do, but <HI>Walk softly</HI> all our Days in the <HI>Bitterness of our Soul,</HI> from the Remembrance of our past Miscarriages. We would not have the Holy One to do it against us, but let us <HI>Remember</HI> against <HI>our selves,</HI> our <HI>Former Iniquities;</HI> and upon the Review thereof, Let our La∣mentations be those; Lam. III. 19, 20. <HI>Remembring the Wormwood and the Gall, my Soul has them still in Remembrance, &amp; is humbled in me.</HI> Have we been Left unto such as I may call. <HI>Sins of Distincti∣on?</HI> It is a most humbling Remark that we have to make upon it. Other Deal∣ings of God with us, be they never so Bitter Ones, may be but <HI>Paternal Chas∣tisements</HI> after all. But when God leaves us to <HI>Sin</HI> against Him, This looks as if he dealt more <HI>Vindictively</HI> with us, Alas, Herein▪ He has <HI>wounded us with the wound of an Enemy,</HI> and <HI>with the Chastisement of a very Angry One.</HI> O dreadful, O dread∣ful, Indignation of God! We may now cry out, <HI>O Lord, Thou hast rebuked me in thy wrath; with wounds that stink &amp; are corrupt, because of my Foolishness.</HI> The Wise man says concerning the Sins of <HI>Unchastity; They are the Abhorred of the
<PB N="35" REF="001626_0051_0FB3E0F712C88860"/>
Lord, that fall into them!</HI> I may say un∣to you, Sirs, To be given up to <HI>Sin,</HI> 'tis a <HI>plague for a Devil!</HI> Oh, <HI>Plague</HI> a thou∣sand times more horrible than the <HI>Pes∣tilence</HI> that is the <HI>Terror of the Night:</HI> How can we be free from <HI>Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or,</HI> when we see our selves thus <HI>horribly plagued,</HI> and in so <HI>hot a Displeasure</HI> of God!</P>
<P>And now, What remains to be done in this most Lamentable Case? What, but this? We must make our Flight un∣to our Great <HI>Saviour,</HI> and His Great <HI>Sa∣crifice,</HI> and for the Pardon, of our Sin, plead that <HI>Blood</HI> which <HI>Cleanses from all Sin.</HI> This must be done with a <HI>Repent∣ing</HI> Soul: A Soul full of <HI>Contrition</HI> for Sin; full of <HI>Indignation</HI> against our selves for our Sin; full of <HI>Resolution</HI> to watch against all Return to our Sin. We must not lay the least Blame on the <HI>Holy God,</HI> for not <HI>Witholding us from Sin,</HI> but with an unspeakable Remorse blame <HI>our selves</HI> for not Looking up unto Him to <HI>With∣hold</HI> us. This <HI>Repentance</HI> must never be Laid aside; it must be often <HI>Renewed;</HI> it must be always <HI>Maintained;</HI> it must <HI>Live</HI> to the Last; never be laid aside until we <HI>Die.</HI> The <HI>Penitential Psalms,</HI> and the Records of our Sins, that call for our <HI>Penitentials,</HI> the very <HI>Curtains</HI>

of our <HI>Death-bed,</HI> as I may say, should have these written upon them. We must hereupon Study to Excel in such <HI>Vertues,</HI> and such <HI>Vertuous Actions,</HI> as are very directly <HI>contrary</HI> to the points wherein we have more Egregiously <HI>Sin∣ned.</HI> We should set our selves to think; <HI>What Good Thing shall I labour to be and to do, that I may Glorify God, in the way that is most contrary to that wherein I have dishonoured Him?</HI> Upon this, All our past Sins will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e before the Lord, as if they had never been at all. A <HI>God ready to pardon,</HI> will now say of us, <HI>I will Remember their Sins no more.</HI> However, with us they should not be so. <HI>We</HI> should always <HI>Remember</HI> them. I am now preparing, <HI>A Treacle out of a Viper.</HI> Since we have not been <HI>Witheld</HI> from some very Enormous <HI>Out-breakings of Sin,</HI> by this very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, we may and should be <HI>Witheld</HI> from One Sin which is very offensive to the most High God; such an Offence, that He <HI>knows</HI> them, &amp; throws them <HI>afar off,</HI> and makes Reject∣ed <HI>Lepers</HI> of them that are under the power of it; PRIDE is that Sin. It may be, our <HI>Pride</HI> caused our <HI>Fall;</HI> And now our <HI>Fall</HI> may cure our <HI>Pride.</HI> It may be of Use to <HI>Withold Pride</HI> from

us. It may inspire into us, a most Aba∣sing, a most Beautiful <HI>Humility.</HI> After we have so <HI>fallen,</HI> methinks, we should never be <HI>Lifted up</HI> with <HI>Pride</HI> any more. If a <HI>proud Thought</HI> begin to rise in our Minds, we should presently retund it, with such a Stroke upon it; <HI>What! Such a Wretch as I, ever be proud of any thing!</HI> When we meet with any <HI>Con∣temptuous Treatment</HI> among our Neigh∣bours, we should now bear it very pa∣tiently. Think, <HI>My Sin has made me a Contemptible Creature!</HI> And let this Thought produce a <HI>perfect work</HI> of <HI>Pa∣tience</HI> in us; <HI>Being Reviled, now Re∣vile not again.</HI> And, when we see o∣others <HI>Overtaken with a Fault,</HI> with what Compassion, with what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with what Clemency, should we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dulcify the <HI>Reproofs,</HI> which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give unto them! <HI>Considering our selves, how we have been Tempted!</HI> Here the Riddle of, <HI>Meat out of the Eater,</HI> will be accomplished admirably!</P>
<P>But I see one in this <HI>Auditory,</HI> who has very peculiar cause to be Atten∣tive unto these Things; and I suppose, he does give such an Attention, as can be expected from no one else in this <HI>Congregation of God.</HI> A Young man,
<PB N="38" REF="001626_0054_0FB3E0FB6F865608"/>
who has not been <HI>witheld</HI> from a <HI>Sin,</HI> for which now he must not be <HI>witheld</HI> from the <HI>Pit;</HI> he must <HI>hasten to the Pit,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>one may stay him.</HI> This Youth has with some Expression of Amazement at it, signified unto me, some sense of the <HI>Strange Wayes,</HI> which the Holy One takes to bring home his <HI>Elect</HI> unto Himself. Had he not been Left unto the <HI>Capital Crime</HI> for which he is now to Dy, he thinks he had probably gone on Sinning, and Stupid, and Secure, and <HI>Slept</HI> himself into a <HI>Damnation that Slumbreth not.</HI> But his <HI>Capital Crime</HI> has bro't him into such <HI>Awakening Circumstances</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he shall be Effectually bro't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unto God. Ah, poor <HI>David;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I wish, We all pray, That thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> find it so! I need not now Re∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t unto you, the <HI>Directions</HI> for a <HI>Sound Repentance,</HI> which the Ministers of God in this Town, are charitably and continually inculcating upon you. There was a <HI>David,</HI> who had the Guilt of <HI>Innocent Blood</HI> upon him; With the Strains and the Cries, and the Tears, of the <HI>Fifty first Psalm,</HI> he found Mer∣cy with God. I know something of the price you set upon that admirable <HI>Psalm.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="001626_0055_0FB3E0FCE9CEFCD8"/>
Do so still; and present before God, the <HI>Blood</HI> of a dear JESUS, for the Expiati∣on of your <HI>Bloody Murder,</HI> and of all the Sins, which have so provoked the Holy One, that He has not <HI>witheld</HI> you from it. That <HI>Blood</HI> is an <HI>Open Foun∣tain;</HI> yea, <HI>Open</HI> for a <HI>Menasseh,</HI> and for a <HI>Murderer!</HI> A Country-man of yours, Executed for <HI>Murder,</HI> after his Flight unto that Soul-cleansing Blood, went chearfully to his Execution; and often used those words; <HI>God is a Great For∣ver! God is a Great Forgiver!</HI> Verily, A Repenting <HI>David</HI> will find Him so.</P>
<P>I will inform the <HI>Auditory.</HI> This poor Young man tells me; He uses all his <HI>power</HI> to turn unto God; but he finds he has no <HI>power,</HI> in himself; He looks up to God for <HI>power,</HI> and owns himself <HI>un∣worthy</HI> that God should give it him. He tells me, He sees his <HI>Heart</HI> full of <HI>Cor∣ruption,</HI> and his <HI>Life</HI> all <HI>Iniquity;</HI> but he looks on all Sin as most <HI>odious,</HI> because it is <HI>an Offence unto God.</HI> He tells me, That a <HI>Saviour</HI> appears to him, the <HI>best thine</HI> in the word; &amp; an <HI>Interest</HI> in Him worth a thousand worlds. He tells me, That he desires the <HI>Saviour</HI> to <HI>Reconcile.</HI> God unto him, and also to <HI>humble</HI> him,
<PB N="40" REF="001626_0056_0FB3E0FE5F5B9A68"/>
and give a <HI>New Heart</HI> unto him, &amp; fill his Heart with the <HI>Love of God.</HI> He tells me, That the <HI>Hope</HI> he has of <HI>Mercy</HI> from God, <HI>breaks his Heart</HI> for him; &amp; makes him think, <HI>What he shall do for God.</HI> Particularly, He desires, that his <HI>Sins</HI> may be <HI>known</HI> to all the World; &amp; that all the World may be warned from him, and <HI>witheld</HI> from Sinning against God. If all this be <HI>Hearty,</HI> 'tis well. <HI>Repentance</HI> in Distress, is often so <HI>De∣ceitful,</HI> that, <HI>Young man,</HI> you cannot be too jealous of your own <HI>Heart,</HI> in yours. But, I shall proceed unto ano∣ther Article of work, that is now pro∣vided for me.</P>
<P>V. Learn where to <HI>go,</HI> Learn what to <HI>do,</HI> that we may be <HI>Witheld from Sinning</HI> against our God. Oh! Tis a <HI>Mercy,</HI> no Tongue is able to declare how <HI>Desirea∣ble;</HI> more to be <HI>Desired than Gold, than much fine Gold!</HI> And one may shake to think, what they who are not very <HI>De∣sirous</HI> of it, may be Left unto.</P>
<P>There are especially Three Counsils, which I am now to tender you.</P>
<P>First. You must not be too <HI>Confident;</HI> you must beware of rash <HI>Confidence.</HI> Don't <HI>Confidently</HI> presume upon it, That
<PB N="41" REF="001626_0057_0FB3E0FFE2B24F18"/>
there is any <HI>One Sin,</HI> from which you can <HI>Withold your selves.</HI> I tell you tru∣ly, There is no One Sin more certainly, and more awfully corrected, by a mans being Left unto some very <HI>flagrant Sin,</HI> than this <HI>Vain Presumption.</HI> The best Advice that can be given us, is that; 1 Cor. 10. 12. <HI>Let him that thinks, he stands, take heed lest he fall.</HI> When we see any one fall into the most <HI>Atrocious Crimes</HI> that can be found among the <HI>Sons of Men,</HI> whose <HI>Hearts</HI> are <HI>fully set in them to do Evil;</HI> it becomes us to Reflect with one of the pious Ancients; <HI>Ille he∣ri, Ego hodie, Tu cras.</HI> He fell <HI>yesterday,</HI> because Left unto himself; I shall fall <HI>To Day,</HI> and, you, my Brother, will fall <HI>To morrow,</HI> if God Leave us, as He di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Fallen Sinner. Don't say within your selves, (I use the Term <HI>within your selves,</HI> because few have so little Wit, as to speak it audibly;) <HI>Well, I am sure, I shall never do so Base a Thing, as I have seen done by such a man.</HI> Man, my Heart akes, to hear thee say so. When <HI>David</HI> had his <HI>Heart smiting</HI> him, for a small Disrespect shown unto a Father-in-law, had any one told him, <HI>Sir, You shall one Day fall into very filthy Adulteries, and when you have done so, instead of taking
<PB N="42" REF="001626_0058_0FB3E10288414BE8"/>
an easie way to cover them, you shall fly to treacherous and barbarous Murders for the Covering of them, and the whole world shall in all Ages be astonished at what you'll be Left unto!</HI> Doubtless, he would have derided the praediction; He would have said, <HI>It is impossible!</HI> When <HI>Peter</HI> was told, that he would within a few Hours, <HI>Deny, Renounce, Forswear the Lord,</HI> whom he thought, he lov'd above a thousand Worlds; did he believe a word of it? But all the World have with Astonish∣ment seen the Consequences! <HI>David Wallis</HI> once thought as little as another man, that he should ever come, to what we now see him come to. Oh! <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear &amp; trem∣bling,</HI> of what you may be Left unto.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, with <HI>Faith</HI> in the only Saviour, who is <HI>Able to keep you from falling;</HI> This is a most necessary Course, that you may not <HI>Fall</HI> to the <HI>breaking of your Bones; Fall</HI> into the <HI>hor∣rible Pit.</HI> Our dear Saviour, has under∣taken to keep His people, from the <HI>Falls into Sin,</HI> that might <HI>Separate them from the Love of God.</HI> All the <HI>Grace</HI> that is needful to keep us from any <HI>Falls,</HI> 'tis Lodg'd and Laid up in our dear Saviour for us. When we come into the <HI>Cove∣nant
<PB N="43" REF="001626_0059_0FB3E103A41B4558"/>
of Grace,</HI> 'tis with a Consent, That our Saviour shall be our <HI>Keeper:</HI> This incomparable <HI>Nazarene.</HI> We say to Him, <HI>Lord, thou art He that keeps my Soul!</HI> And we Lay Hold on that word, <HI>The Lord shall preserve thy Soul.</HI> But then, frequent must be our <HI>Supplications</HI> unto the Lord. Supplicate at that rate; <HI>Oh! Let not my Heart be inclined unto any Evil Thing!</HI> Supplicate at that rate; <HI>Oh! Do thou hold me up and I shall be safe; and I shall have Respect unto thy Statutes continually!</HI> Supplicate at that rate? <HI>Consider me, O Lord my God, Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my Enemy say, I have prevailed against him!</HI> Tis a most suitable petition for you; Psal. CXIX. 116. <HI>Lord, Uphold me, according to thy Word.</HI> Souls, you are not so much urged unto that Prayer, <HI>Lord, Withold me from a state of Pover∣ty:</HI> For one may be <HI>poor in this▪ World,</HI> and <HI>Rich in Faith.</HI> You are not so much urged unto that Prayer, <HI>Lord, Withold me from a Disgraced or a Despised Name.</HI> For one may have their <HI>Honour</HI> here <HI>Laid in the Dust,</HI> and yet have a <HI>Name written in Heaven.</HI> You are not so much urged unto that Prayer, <HI>Lord, Withold me from Sicknesses;</HI> For one may <HI>be Sick,</HI> and yet be <HI>one whom Jesus loves.</HI> But
<PB N="44" REF="001626_0060_0FB3E1052D03AE80"/>
this, this is the <HI>Prayer</HI> I urge you to; <HI>Lord, Withold me from Sinning against thee.</HI> Think a thousand times on that word, <HI>Wo unto them, when I depart from them!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Take the <HI>Warnings</HI> of such as have not been <HI>witheld from Sin;</HI> Be <HI>warned,</HI> Be <HI>warned,</HI> against <HI>Sin,</HI> when you see what <HI>their Sin</HI> has brought them to.</P>
<P>Especially, Let our <HI>Young People</HI> now take heed, that they do not slight the <HI>warnings</HI> of God. Methinks, I over∣hear the merciful God, saying over the <HI>Young People</HI> in this Place, <HI>How shall I give them up!</HI> And He therefore mul∣tiplies unto them those <HI>warnings,</HI> on which every one might Reasonably say, Surely, They will now fear <HI>God, and receive Instruction, that so they may not be cut off.</HI> Among those whom God has employ'd for the <HI>warning</HI> of the <HI>Young People</HI> in this Place, that they may be <HI>witheld from Sinning against</HI> Him, here is a poor Young man before you, that is just <HI>going to the Dead.</HI> God is this day holding up a <HI>Young man</HI> in Chains, that all the <HI>Young People</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="001626_0061_0FB3E106AAA7F7B8"/>
may take <HI>warning</HI> from him, and be <HI>witheld</HI> from Sinning against the <HI>God of their Fathers.</HI> When <HI>Asahel</HI> had been smitten by <HI>Abner,</HI> we read, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> II. 23. <HI>It came to pass, that as many as came to the Place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</HI> Behold here a poor Young man <HI>smitten to Death;</HI> You are come to the place where a Young man <HI>falls down and dies,</HI> in the Violent pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> suit of many Sins. <HI>Young men,</HI> won't you <HI>stand still</HI> at this Bleeding Spectacle By a Young man thus Lying in his Blood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>witheld</HI> from going on any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in such Sins, as you now hear hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the <HI>Groans of a Deadly Wounded Man</HI> complaining of! He desires <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and it is a <HI>Token for Good</HI> upon his that he does so; To make use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tragical Example, for the saving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others, from such Sins, as have destroy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and <HI>Murdered</HI> him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> brought him unto the Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. I am to tell you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Things that Ly <HI>Heavy</HI> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he is the more willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

have them told, because he hopes, a merciful Saviour who has called such <HI>Heavy-Laden</HI> Sinners unto Him, has taken off the <HI>heavy Loads:</HI> The sad causes of <HI>Heaviness.</HI></P>
<P>First; His Disregard unto <HI>Parental Instructions;</HI> This Troubles Him. He was bred in a Family, that had in it the <HI>Exercises of Piety,</HI> and he was there Instructed in his <HI>Catechism.</HI> These Early means of Good, had <HI>no</HI> Impressi∣on on him: And so he proves one, whose Father has no Joy. [<HI>Good God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> thou and support his Distressed Fa∣ther, when the Tidings of this Day arrive unto him.</HI>] The <HI>Trouble</HI> for such <HI>unfruit∣fulness</HI> makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow a <HI>great</HI> Impression on him. We read of some who had been well counselled by their Father, but proved vitious Young men: I pray, what came they to? We read, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> II. 25. <HI>They hearkned not unto the voice of their Father, because the Lord would s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay them.</HI> Children, Hearken to this, Your <HI>Parents</HI> give you their counsils, To <HI>Converse much with the word of God,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="001626_0063_0FB3E109AA26C580"/>
and, To <HI>uphold the Religion of the Closet,</HI> and, To <HI>shun Wicked Company.</HI> Won't you <HI>Hearken</HI> to them? Tis because the Great God has a dreadful Thing to do upon you. You now make nothing of <HI>Troubling your Parents.</HI> Be assured, God will <HI>Trouble</HI> you for your Impiety. And when you are in your <HI>Troubles,</HI> your outcry will be, <HI>How have I not o∣bey'd the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined my Ear to them that instructed me!</HI> It is a Thing, which I wish you would more think upon; Very few come to the Gallowes, but what make that outcry there; <HI>My undutiful carriage to my Pa∣rents, has Laid the Foundation of all the Confusion that is come upon me!</HI> And the more of a <HI>Religious Education</HI> the Chil∣dren have had, the more it may be ex∣pected, that the Holy God will appear as a <HI>swift Witness</HI> against them, if they do not answer it. I suppose there are many Young men, who have been more Extravagant and Rebellious <HI>Prodigals,</HI> than this <HI>Young man;</HI> who yet has been Bad enough. But no doubt, his <HI>Edu∣cation,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="001626_0064_0FB3E10B28147F80"/>
This has <HI>hastened</HI> the Judgments of God upon him, has <HI>Ripened</HI> him for the Judgments of God. <HI>Children of a Good Education,</HI> If <HI>you</HI> do Wickedly, the Judgments of God, will cut you off, more <HI>fearfully,</HI> and <HI>speedily,</HI> than any in the World.</P>
<P>There is another thing, that this Young man very much layes to Heart; that is, Ungoverned <HI>passion,</HI> Inordinate <HI>passion:</HI> This at last, brought a <HI>Stab∣bing Fury</HI> upon him; You see what it has cost him.

<P>The Young man mourns for another Thing, which too often breaks out, as the <HI>smoke</HI> of <HI>the Bottomless Pitt,</HI> from a a Soul <HI>raging in his Folly.</HI> Tis this; <HI>Be∣cause of Swearing his Heart mourns:</HI> The profane <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Cursing,</HI> wherewith sometimes he struck at the <HI>Glorious &amp; Fearful Name of GOD.</HI> This now re∣coils upon himself; Tis a Dagger at his <HI>Heart,</HI> now God has <HI>made his Plagues Wonderful.</HI> A most <HI>Senseless</HI> Iniquity!

<P>There is yet another Introduction to all mischief, which this Young Man does now in <HI>sober sadness</HI> bestow his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears upon. I cannot hear that he was a <HI>Common Drunkard;</HI> but if he had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been somewhat <HI>in Drink,</HI> at the
<PB N="53" REF="001626_0069_0FB3E112A80A3A98"/>
Time of it, (which he had been, alas, at other times) it is probable he had never done the Fact for which he sees the <HI>cutting off of his Days,</HI> and is <HI>depri∣ved of the Residue of his Years.</HI> Nor is he the only one, that has been Execu∣ted in this Place, for things done by them, when <HI>Strong Drink</HI> had <HI>Enraged</HI> them. <HI>Tell them therefore, Thus saith</HI> the Holy One, <HI>I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; That Lying proverb, A Drunken man gets no Harm.</HI> I thought, you had seen <HI>Harm,</HI> enough to follow upon <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> in the <HI>Ig∣nominy,</HI> which it fixes upon them that wallow in it; <HI>Harm</HI> enough, in the <HI>wast of Substance</HI> that arises from such <HI>Beastly Living; Harm</HI> enough in the <HI>Diseases,</HI> in the <HI>Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sters,</HI> in the <HI>un∣timely Deaths</HI> which it Leads unto: And, what?

Tis a copious Language, and yet it uses but one word for <HI>A Drun∣kard,</HI> and <HI>A Madman.</HI> But if this be not enough, certainly, to be brought to the <HI>Gallows</HI> is <HI>Harm</HI> enough. O Lovers of <HI>Strong Drink,</HI> There is <HI>Death</HI> in that <HI>Pott,</HI> that <HI>Cup,</HI> with which you are intoxicated. Never give over cry∣ing to God, until he has delivered you, from the Vice, which thus <HI>drowns you in Perdition.</HI></P>
<P>But I am informed of one thing, which will perfectly Shock every <HI>Sober Christian</HI> that shall hear of such a thing. I remember our <HI>Tertullian,</HI> in his <HI>Apo∣logetick</HI> relates, how severe the Ancient Romans were, against their <HI>Women,</HI> if any of <HI>Them</HI> were found hankering af∣ter <HI>Strong drink.</HI> I suppose, he took his Relation out of <HI>Pliny.</HI> And in∣deed <HI>he,</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> and some other <HI>Roman Writers,</HI> report such severities used on that occasion, that I do not care to mention them, lest abused <HI>Hus∣bands</HI> under their irritations take too much Advantage of it. So much I will
<PB N="55" REF="001626_0071_0FB3E115AEE91820"/>
say; <HI>Drunkenness</HI> in a <HI>Woman,</HI> was as Criminal among them as <HI>Adultery.</HI> But now, it is said; That there are <HI>Women</HI> in this Place who are no Strangers to the Sin, and Trade of <HI>Excessive Drin∣king.</HI> The <HI>Town</HI> has had cause to know the Truth of this; Ah! Miserable Women: The <HI>Blemish</HI> of their Sex: And such as the Countrey may call, as one did his Daughter, the <HI>Ulcers</HI> of it! I can tell the Name of a Pious Woman, who was unjustly suspected of being in Drink. That Handmaid of the Lord, in her Vindication cried out, <HI>No, I should be a Daughter of Beliel, if I should be guilty of such a thing.</HI> To them who cannot so well Vindicate themselves as <HI>Hannah</HI> could, I will say; <HI>How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy Strong Drink from thee!</HI> If thou art a <HI>Woman of a sorrowful Spirit,</HI> instead of pouring in <HI>Strong Drink,</HI> Oh!

<P>I think, the Young man is willing, that I should from him also tell you, That when a Man comes to Dye, the
<PB N="56" REF="001626_0072_0FB3E117E4A2DC48"/>
Sins of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> will be Felt as more <HI>bitter than Death</HI> unto him. One of old who had Experience enough, Pro∣nounced them so. I can at this Hour show you another, who does it. <HI>Sins</HI> they are, that leave Cursed <HI>stings</HI> be∣hind them. There is one thing which I have more than once or twice ob∣served; and I have heard that the fa∣mous Mr. <HI>Perkins,</HI> also, who dealt much with Condemned Prisoners, observed it. <HI>Adultery</HI> was Capital in the old Law of <HI>Israel,</HI> and is so at this Day in the Law of some other Nations. Tis not so in our <HI>Law;</HI> yea, This <HI>Adulte∣rous Generation</HI> makes a Trifle of it. But very many of them who come to a Capital Execution for other things, cry out, <HI>God has set my secret Adulteries in the Light of His Counte∣nance; my Secret Adulteries, I see God has known them, and been a Witness of them.</HI> O you that pursue any Un∣lawful Amours, Give over; <HI>God will Judge you,</HI> if you go on any further in them.

<P>One thing more: My poor Young man does Lament the Temptations, &amp; the Wretchednesses of the <HI>Sea-fa∣ring Life</HI> exceedingly. He ran to Sea Ten years ago, when he was about fourteen Years of Age, without and against the mind of his <HI>Father;</HI> Tho' he has been since Reconciled unto his <HI>Father,</HI> yet he has found the Ill Effects of so leaving him. The <HI>Sea,</HI> that e∣ver that <HI>Element</HI> should be so poiso∣ning, so polluting! Truly, Our <HI>Sea-faring Tribe,</HI> do call for a most extra∣ordinary Concern and Pity from us!</P>
<P>You, Our <HI>Brothers,</HI> are under many Obligations to be the <HI>Best of men.</HI> But <HI>I hear</HI> that you are much otherwise, <HI>&amp; I partly believe it.</HI> Yea, <HI>It is commonly Reported,</HI> That the <HI>Sailours</HI> are sensi∣bly <HI>degenerated</HI> in the Last Ten or a

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Psalm LI. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltiness, O GOD, thou God of my Salvation: And my Tongue shall Sing aloud of thy Righteousness:</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>Psalm,</HI> as it was Composed by One of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Saints,</HI> upon one of the most <HI>Sad Oc∣casions</HI> that was ever known; So it breathes the most Consummate Repentance; Expressing in the most

lively colours, and in the most affecting manner, the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iction and Distress, Hu∣miliations, Fears and Desires of a <HI>Re∣penting Soul. David</HI> had been guilty of one of the foulest Acts of Wickedness in the matter of <HI>Ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah,</HI> which Sin he here bitterly bewails; <Q>and as a Testimony of his unfeigned Sorrow, and that he might be as notorious an Instance of true Repentance, He sends this <HI>Hymn</HI> to the <HI>Master of Musick</HI> in the Taberna∣cle, to be there perpetually used.</Q> In the <HI>Text,</HI> he names the very fact and bloody guilt, which was <HI>Murder;</HI> that Enormous Crime, the <HI>Guilt of Blood,</HI> shed in a very base and barbarous manner; for he <HI>Slew Uriah with the Sword of the Children of Ammon.</HI> He cries to God for Mercy, and makes his Supplication to his Judge for Pardon.</P>
<P><HI>Deliver me from Blood-Guiltiness: i e.</HI> <Q>Let me not Ly under the Guilt and Condemnation hereby contracted, but let it be pardoned to me, and let me never be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t unto the like again. De∣liver me from the punishment due un∣to this Crying Sin: And Lord ever prevent and keep me from it any more, by thy Restraining Grace.</Q> This Prayer he addresses to GOD, who only
<PB N="5" REF="001626_0084_0FB3E129ED004380"/>
can <HI>Forgive</HI> Sin, or <HI>Keep</HI> us from Sinning. He eyes him as the <HI>God of his Salvation;</HI> his Prayer being for <HI>Salvation</HI> from the Dominion of Sin, &amp; from the Condem∣nation due thereunto. You may observe also a great <HI>Vehemency and Earnestness</HI> in this his Supplication; he prays in the most ardent, fervent manner.</P>
<P>Finally. HE Makes his solemn <HI>Vow and Promise,</HI> that God should have the <HI>Glory</HI> both of the Pardoning Mercy, and Renewing Grace: <HI>My Tongue shall sing aloud of thy Righteousness. Righteousness</HI> is here used for Grace, Mercy, Clemen∣cy, Truth and Faithfulness. This he would <HI>Sing of,</HI> Confess, Laud and Cele∣brate in Songs of Praise, Thansksgiving and Blessing. And he would sing <HI>aloud</HI> of it; in the most <HI>publick</HI> manner he would proclaim the Infinite Goodness &amp; Faithfulness of God to Returning Sin∣ners.</P>
<P>GODS <HI>Righteousness</HI> is often out for his <HI>Grace</HI> in the great business of a Sin∣ners Justification and Sanctification. <HI>They</HI> meet together herein. <HI>This</HI> the Penitent comforts himself in, and there∣fore <HI>Sings</HI> of it. And this he sings <HI>aloud</HI> of, to acquaint and affect others there∣with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001626_0085_0FB3E12B6CA8B570"/>
There are two or three things to be observed in the words. 1. The hainous Guilt of Murder. 2. That Deliverance from it is to be earnestly sought of God. 3. That God must have the Glory of such Preservation and Deliverance.</P>
<P>I. <HI>That Murder is a Sin of a very hai∣nous and heavy guilt.</HI> So the <HI>Text</HI> speaks of it; <HI>Blood-guiltiness,</HI> or the guilt of <HI>Blood.</HI> A deep <HI>Stain,</HI> &amp; a deep <HI>Wound;</HI> whereby the Conscience is gashed and defiled.</P>
<P>I will only look into the <HI>Law of God,</HI> and observe to you how it is forbidden and condemned therein. It cries from the Ground, and brings down Vengeance from Heaven. <HI>Cain</HI> was the first <HI>Mur∣derer</HI> after the <HI>Devil,</HI> who was so from the beginning. <HI>He was of that Wicked One, and slew his Brother.</HI> Then God the Soveraign Judge said to him; <HI>What hast thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood crieth to me from the Ground; and now thou art cursed from the Earth, which has open'd her mouth to receive thy bro∣thers blood from thy hand,</HI> Gen. 4. 10, 11. <Q>Murder is a Crying Sin; it cries in the dying words of <HI>Zachariah, The Lord look upon it and require it:</HI> Or in those
<PB N="7" REF="001626_0086_0FB3E12CE01AC3E8"/>
words of the <HI>Souls under the Altar; How long Lord, Holy and True?</HI> The Heavens <HI>reveal</HI> this Iniquity, and the Earth rises up against it, <HI>Lamech</HI> was one of <HI>Cains</HI> Accursed Race, and it should seem of the same bloody and barbarous Disposition: Whether he had Murer'd any of the <HI>Holy Seed</HI> or no, yet certainly he owns himself to be a very fierce and cruel man; and he glories in this his shame, as such fierce and bloody people use to do:</Q> with a haughty Impenitence he presumes on, and challenges the Protection of Pro∣vidence. He had a gall'd but an unhum∣bled Conscience: <HI>I have slain a man to my wounding, &amp; a Young man to my hurt.</HI></P>
<P>See how severely the Law of God for∣bids Murder, &amp; makes it Capital. <HI>Gen.</HI> IX. 5, 6. <HI>And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣deth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the Image of God made he man.</HI> Numb. 35. 31, 33. <HI>Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> surely put to death. So ye shall not
<PB N="8" REF="001626_0087_0FB3E12E70D03F10"/>
pollute the land wherein you are: for blood defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</HI> Exo. XXI. 14. <HI>But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay him with guile, thou shalt take him from mine Altar, that he may die.</HI> Prov. XXVIII. 17. <HI>A man that doeth violence to the blood of any Person, shall flee to the Pit, let no man stay him.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Texts</HI> need no Comment; they utterly forbid the Concealment or the Protection of a <HI>Murderer</HI> among a people; the <HI>Government</HI> may not Par∣don this Sin, nor People interceed for it; It may not be <HI>bought</HI> off by any <HI>Price</HI> or any <HI>Favour,</HI> on the pain of Guilt on the Publick: Gods <HI>Altar</HI> may not shelter him, and much less any Humane Power or Pity.</P>
<P>Let no man think that this looks <HI>Cruel</HI> or <HI>Inhumane:</HI> The Justice of God has so fix'd it; Yea, his tender <HI>Mer∣cies</HI> to Mankind do account for this His Righteous Law and Judgment. Let us not presume to arraign the In∣finite Wisdom and Mercies of God, in a partial respect to any natural ten∣derness or compassion of our own:
<PB N="9" REF="001626_0088_0FB3E12FE02F1AF0"/>
We shall, so invade and sacrifice all Law, both Humane and Divine to our own weakness.</P>
<P>No <HI>Humanity</HI> or Law of Mercy will allow us to desire or endeavour the saving the life of him that is Convict of Murder. It is a wrong to <HI>Humane Nature</HI> in the highest manner; and the mercy and <HI>protection</HI> of Humane Nature is utterly forfeited; yea, the Revenges thereof are incurred.</P>
<P><HI>Murder is the greatest wrong to God;</HI> at whose <HI>Image</HI> the Stab is, and at His <HI>Dominion. Life</HI> is the most preci∣ous of all the good gifts of God ▪ He is the absolute Lord of it, and has re∣served the disposal of it intirely to Himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magistrate</HI> is the <HI>Minister</HI> of God, and the <HI>Avenger</HI> to Execute wrath upon him that does Evil; God has put the <HI>Sword</HI> into his hands, to cut off Evil-doers from the Inheritance of the Lord, and he must <HI>not bear the Sword in vain. Government</HI> among Man∣kind, is for this reason of the last ne∣cessity, and one of the great <HI>Goods</HI> to the World. But for any <HI>Private Per∣son</HI> voluntarily to take away his Neigh∣bours Life, whether in <HI>Clandestine man∣ner,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="001626_0089_0FB3E1315FA0D128"/>
or by <HI>Open violence,</HI> is the ex∣treamest Injury to our Neighbour, and one of the highest Offences against Humane Society.</P>
<P>A mans <HI>Life</HI> is Invaluable to him, and it is not to be <HI>repaired,</HI> there is nothing equal to it; not all a mans precious Substance. <HI>Skin for Skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his Life. Self-love,</HI> and Self-preservation, are an Invincible Principle, and Law, implanted by God in the hearts of all men.</P>
<P>But then moreover, to take away the Life of any one, <HI>fixes his Soul for Eterni∣ty</HI> in an Unchangeable State of Happi∣ness or Misery: and so (as one says) not only is all Temporal Good hereby at once ravished from a man, but his Soul incurs infinite hazard, and it may be damage.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>Humane Society,</HI> the Sin of Murder strikes at the very <HI>Being,</HI> and all the <HI>Comforts</HI> hereof. For there were no more living in any quiet or safety, if this might be allow'd, then there might be among the wild and savage Beasts of the Woods, where the stronger and fier∣cer prey upon the weak and mild. So that Societies must <HI>disband,</HI> and all the
<PB N="11" REF="001626_0090_0FB3E132F6AC1030"/>
<HI>Rules</HI> as well as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of it <HI>dissolve</HI> to∣gether, if the Crime of Murder, were not held Capital, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unpardonably so among men. As <HI>Jacob</HI> said of his <HI>two Sons,</HI> and all his Fatherly Goodness could not reconcile him to them, nor cover their bloody Stain: <HI>Gen.</HI> 49. 5, 6, 7. <HI>Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations. O my Soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their as∣sembly, mine honour be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Murder</HI> ordinarily comes of cruel &amp; <HI>cursed passion.</HI> This does not excuse the Fact; for the <HI>Law</HI> is made to govern mens passions, or to punish the Enor∣mous Outrages of them; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 9. <HI>Knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless &amp; disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man sla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>two</HI> things in the <HI>Law of Moses,</HI> that were high Expressions of the Hainous Nature of <HI>Man-slaughter</HI> in the Account of God: The <HI>one</HI> was, that
<PB N="12" REF="001626_0091_0FB3E13461F1BA50"/>
he that kill'd a man by <HI>Accident or Un∣awares</HI> was obliged to flee to some <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> where he must remain in <HI>Ba∣nishment</HI> from his own House and Pa∣trimony, and in a kind of <HI>Prison</HI> there, until the death of the <HI>High Priest.</HI> By which it is certain that God meant to teach us to conceive a dread and horror of the Guilt of Blood; in that tho' the Fact were not <HI>Voluntary,</HI> nor done de∣signedly; tho' it were but <HI>Chance-med∣ly,</HI> and <HI>Homicide per Infortunium,</HI> yet that the Man-slayer must incur so much danger, inconvenience and confinement. The <HI>other</HI> Argument of the Criminalness of Murder was, that if a <HI>Brute Creature</HI> happened at any time to kill a man, it was to be slain by the Hand of <HI>Justice, Exod.</HI> 21. 28, 29. <HI>If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten: but the owner of the ox shall be quit. But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his Owner: and he hath not kept him in: but that he hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and his Owner also shall be put to Death.</HI> Here was another high Instance of Gods Care of the Life of Man, and of his Detesta∣tion
<PB N="13" REF="001626_0092_0FB3E135DE557508"/>
of the Sin of Murder. And indeed this was according to that more <HI>Catho∣lick Law</HI> given unto <HI>Noah; The Blood of your Lives will I require of every Beast.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, <HI>Natural Conscience</HI> has the highest resentment and horror a∣gainst the Sin of Murder; it is an uni∣versal and irresistible Principle in the Hearts of all men. And famous to that purpose was that <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Com∣mon-wealth of Athens,</HI> quoted by Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> of <HI>Eaton,</HI> and since by Dr. <HI>Tow∣erson;</HI> that if only a Wall had by chance fallen down and killed a man, the <HI>Judges</HI> of that Place were to Sit up∣on &amp; Arraign it, &amp; upon Conviction, to throw the <HI>Stones</HI> thereof out of the <HI>Coun∣try.</HI> By this they gave the utmost Tes∣timony, how sacred a thing they esteem∣ed the Life of Man to be, and with what horror they look'd upon the shedding of his Blood.</P>
<P>The most <HI>Barbarous People</HI> and Pla∣ces have a Conscience of the Vengeance due to, and pursuing Murd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rers; wit∣ness what we read of the People of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lita,</HI> who when they saw the <HI>Viper</HI> fast∣ning upon the <HI>Apostles Hand,</HI> cried out, <HI>No doubt this man is a murderer; whom
<PB N="14" REF="001626_0093_0FB3E13762EE17C8"/>
though he hath escaped the sea, yet Venge∣ance suffereth not to live.</HI></P>
<P>And now to look <HI>back</HI> on all that has been said of the <HI>Hainous Nature</HI> of the Sin of <HI>Murder;</HI> It should be improved by all that are here present, <HI>to deter them from all Approaches,</HI> or tendencies towards this Crying Guilt; and People should be warned against indulging the least appearance of it in Will, or Wish, or Word; and also of all wicked <HI>passions</HI> or <HI>Customs</HI> that may but tend to draw on the Fact, or provoke God to leave us to it.</P>
<P>At the same time you see the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> justifyed in their righteous Care to <HI>Purge the Land</HI> of this Guilt; nor can they answer it to God, or their People, to do otherwise: It is their <HI>Obedience</HI> to the Divine Law, and their <HI>Fidelity</HI> and <HI>Tenderness</HI> to Humane Society, that constrain them to the Condem∣nation and Execution of a <HI>Murderer.</HI></P>
<P>And now let me with a <HI>Bleeding Soul Beseech you the poor Condemned Person</HI> here present, to lay to heart the <HI>Greatness</HI> of this your Sin, for which you are this Day to Die: O what <HI>Great Penitence</HI> does such a Great
<PB N="15" REF="001626_0094_0FB3E138ED0A78C8"/>
Sin committed by you, call for! How <HI>heavy</HI> should it Ly on your Consci∣ence! With what <HI>Tears of Blood</HI> should you confess it, and bewail it! I think you have been <HI>bowed down</HI> in Soul un∣der the Weight of it. And Blessed be God who has not left you desti∣tute of the outward signs and expres∣sions of Penitence, Affliction and Sor∣row for this Hainous Fact; from the day (I think) that you committed it. You have in words and signs been in some measure Mourning after <HI>Christ,</HI> af∣ter Repentance, Pardon and Salvati∣on; Be you excited and encouraged to do so more and more, to the last of that few remaining <HI>Moments</HI> of your Life: And the Lord glorify his Renewing and Pardoning Mercy on you.</P>
<P>II. I pass unto the <HI>Second Thing</HI> to be observed from the <HI>Text,</HI> which is, <HI>That Deliverance from this crying Guilt of Blood is to be earnestly sought of God.</HI> This is the very <HI>Petition</HI> in the Text, <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltiness.</HI> So then there is Deliverance from it; and we should be very earnest in Prayer for it unto God.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="001626_0095_0FB3DF0D1948CF10"/>
1. <HI>There is Deliverance from Blood-guiltiness to be obtained from God.</HI> And that of two sorts. 1. To be <HI>kept</HI> from the Bloody Guilt. 2. The <HI>Pardon and Forgiveness</HI> of it when contracted.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We may by the Divine Restraining Grace be kept from the Commission of the Sin of Murder;</HI> and this is a <HI>bles∣sed Deliverance</HI> from Blood-guiltiness. We are thro' Grace all of us (I trust) one only excepted, free of this Guilt; and ever shall be so. But then it is <HI>God that has</HI> kept, prevented and deli∣vered us from it; and He must <HI>here∣after</HI> keep us, or we shall fall into it. For we are <HI>Incident</HI> to it thro' the <HI>horrid Corruption</HI> that is in our Na∣ture; and the very best of us are by no means our own <HI>Keepers.</HI> There is no Sin, but what the <HI>vile and cursed nature</HI> of man is prone to, and capa∣ble of; and the same vile Nature is <HI>common</HI> to us all. <HI>Esau</HI> had Murder in his heart, when he came out against his Brother <HI>Jacob;</HI> and so had <HI>Josephs</HI> Brethren, when they cast him into the <HI>Pit;</HI> but God kept them however from it. GOD left <HI>David</HI> to fall into it, to shew him the wickedness that was in his heart. GOD left <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi,
<PB N="17" REF="001626_0096_0FB3DF0E999CA018"/>
Joab</HI> and <HI>Absalom,</HI> and <HI>others</HI> to fall into it, on one temptation or another. Are we <HI>Better</HI> by Nature than they? No, but God has kept us from their Tempta∣tions, or Restrained us when tempted. When the Prophet of the Lord told <HI>Ha∣zael</HI> the <HI>Syrian</HI> of the Murders, Cruel∣ties and Barbarities which he would in time commit against <HI>Israel;</HI> He answer∣ed with detestation, <HI>But what? is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do this great thing?</HI> such abhorred &amp; enormous wick∣edness: Yet he did it afterward; like a dog he <HI>rent</HI> and <HI>tore</HI> and <HI>devoured;</HI> He prov'd as much a <HI>brute</HI> and beast of <HI>prey,</HI> how impossible soever he before-hand tho't it of himself. And indeed the <HI>An∣gers, Passions,</HI> &amp; <HI>Wraths</HI> of men are so <HI>violent;</HI> that it is a <HI>wonder</HI> of the Di∣vine Restraining Grace, &amp; a marvellous <HI>Instance</HI> of the Power and Providence of God that there are not many <HI>Murders</HI> to one committed in the World. How does <HI>Madness</HI> and <HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>mortal Ha∣tred glare out</HI> in mens looks, and words, and gestures? How easily do they grow <HI>Outrageous,</HI> and strike or draw? From whence come blows <HI>Fightings,</HI> &amp; Duels, and <HI>Stabbing</HI> (more base and cruel than all the rest) but from mens lusts which
<PB N="18" REF="001626_0097_0FB3DF105A57A318"/>
war in their Members? So that the <HI>Sin</HI> is in our Nature; though by the Divine Mercy so few are left to it.</P>
<P>We see a <HI>Miserable Person</HI> present, whom God has left to the great Sin of Murder, while you and I are kept from it? <HI>but who maketh thee to differ?</HI> Art thou <HI>better</HI> than he? Is not thy Nature as bad as his? Have not thy Passions been as violent as his? How often in thy Rage hast thou also been on the <HI>Brink</HI> of this Sin? But God has had <HI>Mercy on thee,</HI> &amp; not suffered thee to <HI>act</HI> thy own cursed <HI>Will.</HI> O <HI>adore</HI> the Soveraign Providence of God! <HI>Behold, the Good∣ness and Severity of God!</HI> to him that is fallen, <HI>Severity,</HI> but to thee <HI>Goodness!</HI> Is he a greater Sinner, than some of us? <HI>I tell thee nay, but except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.</HI></P>
<P>Other <HI>great Sins</HI> do expose and lead to this of <HI>Murder;</HI> by <HI>debauching,</HI> harden∣ing and searing the Conscience; and by <HI>provoking</HI> God to give people up to their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and passions. But to return, It is a blessed deliverance from Sin to be kept from it; to have the guilt and the sorrows of Repentance prevented; and
<PB N="19" REF="001626_0098_0FB3DF119B7A2E00"/>
the present Shames, Miseries and Ruin that do sometimes attend it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is Deliverance from Blood-guiltinses after it is Contracted, by the Commission of Murder: i. e.</HI> The Merci∣ful God has admitted Sinners to Repen∣tance, even in this <HI>Case:</HI> And there is forgiveness of it, and cleansing from it, through the Blood of Christ. It has been repented of we see in our <HI>Text,</HI> &amp; it has been pardoned, 2 Sam. XII. 13. <HI>And David said unto Nathan, I have sin∣ned against the Lord. And Nathan said unto David, the Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. Manasseh</HI> was a great Sinner and Murderer; he fill'd <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with the <HI>Innocent Blood</HI> which he shed; yet was he afterward an Emi∣nent Penitent, and obtained Mercy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mercies</HI> of God are Infinite, Free and Soveraign. <HI>He has mercy on whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> mercy.</HI> The <HI>Merits</HI> and Vertue of the Blood of Christ are also Infinite, and have purchased Pardon for the greatest Sinners upon their Re∣pentance. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Renewing Grace is infinites. <HI>Almighty Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> it can change the hearts of the greatest Sin∣ners, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Worst.

Gospel, its Calls and Promises are <HI>unli∣mited;</HI> to all, even the Chiefest Sinners. Mat. 12. 31. <HI>All maner of Sin and Blas∣phemy shall be forgiven unto men.</HI> Isai. I. 18. <HI>Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord,: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow: tho' they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</HI> 1 Tim. I. 15. <HI>This is a faithful say∣ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</HI> Thus we read again; that the <HI>Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord cleanses from all Sin;</HI> and that <HI>whosoever cometh to Him, He will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>
<P>Here is <HI>Comfort</HI> for thee, <HI>O miserable Malefactor, and Prisoner of Hope!</HI> and how should it revive and chear thy sad and wounded Soul, and cause thee to ad∣mire and adore the Riches of the Mercy of God thro' Christ, his Grace abound∣ing to the chief of Sinners▪ <HI>There is Deliverance from Blood-guiltiness.</HI> There is pardon and forgiveness with God, e∣ven for thee, if thou dost believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and with a repenting, bleeding Soul for this and all thy other Sins, dost find Grace to fly unto His

Blood: I may then, and now do promise you in the Presence, and in the Name of Christ, <HI>My Great Lord and Master, our Common Saviour and Judge,</HI> the free and full Remission of all your Sins, how many or great soever they have been.</P>
<P>O that it might please God to give thee, together with the most affecting sense of the Hainous Nature of thy bloo∣dy Crime; to apprehend the freeness &amp; fulness of his Mercies by Christ Jesus; and thy Saviours Alsufficiency and readi∣ness to bestow both Repentance and Par∣don on thee.</P>
<P>Hear it, and be <HI>astonished;</HI> hear it, and be thou <HI>ravished</HI> with the Grace of God: God gave the Life of his <HI>own Son,</HI> Christ <HI>the Son of God</HI> gave his own Blood, for the Redemption even of Murderers up∣on their Repentance. He died even for <HI>his own</HI> Murderers, for them that with <HI>wicked hands</HI> crucified and slew him the <HI>Prince of Life:</HI> and therefore the Apo∣stle <HI>Peter</HI> calls even upon them to Re∣pent, that their Sins might be blotted out, who had themselves <HI>denied the Holy One,</HI> and the <HI>Just,</HI> and desired a <HI>Murder∣er</HI> to be granted to them.</P>
<P>So then <HI>Christs Blood</HI> can wash away

the Guilt of <HI>Blood;</HI> and Faith in the <HI>Blood of Christ</HI> can both purifie and pa∣cifie the polluted wounded Soul of a Murderer. It is true that St. <HI>John</HI> tells us, <HI>That no Murderer has Eternal Life a∣biding in him.</HI> But the <HI>Apostle</HI> there is speaking of <HI>him that hates his brother,</HI> &amp; has a malicious murderous frame of spi∣rit within him: Such an one abideth in death; and has no seed or principle of Spiritual Life, no beginning of Eternal Life within him. How many <HI>such</HI> Mur∣derers, haters of God and one another, there are among us, under a more dread∣ful sentence then a present bodily death; <HI>He knows</HI> that searches the hearts of the Children of men. But he that has tru∣ly repented of all his Sins, and believeth on the Son of God, though he may have been a Murderer, yet he <HI>has Everlasting Life, and shall not enter into Condemnati∣on</HI> in the World to come; <HI>but is passed from Death unto Life.</HI> Thus then there is Deliverance from Blood-guiltiness. This was the first Thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We should be very earnest in Prayer unto God for this Deliverance:</HI> That He would <HI>keep us</HI> from it: that He would <HI>save</HI> us from the Condemnation due to it.</P>

<P>But <HI>who</HI> is there that will not <HI>wish and pray</HI> to be kept from this Sin of Mur∣der! who would not <HI>deprecate</HI> the being left to it, if it were only in regard of their Temporal Life?

Remember that the <HI>Devil</HI> is a Mur∣derer, and will not the malicious Spirit inspire and stir up as he is able his own <HI>Venome</HI> and <HI>Malignity</HI> in thy Soul? to make thee as like <HI>himself,</HI> and as odious to God, and contrary to Goodness as he can? Remember that this Sin of Mur∣der was the <HI>first Enormity</HI> and <HI>flagitious</HI> Act after the Fall: The Devil hurried wretched <HI>Cain</HI> into This; He was of that Wicked One, and slew his Brother.

<P>And now I turn me again unto the <HI>Wretched Spectacle</HI> before us, whom God <HI>has suffered to fall</HI> into this Crime.

us in this Life, next to his bestowing Sanctifying Grace upon us.

As <HI>Angels</HI> who ne∣ver Sinned, are more happy and blessed for this reason, then Sinners and <HI>Saints</HI> are, whom the Angels <HI>Rejoice over</HI> in their Repentance.</P>
<P>Moreover, God <HI>Owes us not</HI> his Grace, but it is what we have coutinually been <HI>forfeiting,</HI> and by the wicked a∣buse of it <HI>provoked</HI> him times with∣out number, to take it from us.</P>
<P>If then God has kept us from any one, even the worst Transgression, <HI>to His Name</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Glory, Psal.

Glory with exceeding Joy: To the only wise God our Saviour, be Glory and Ma∣jesty, Dominion and Power, both now and Ever. Amen.</HI> Thus let us <HI>Sing aloud</HI> of Gods Righteousness, because that he has graciously kept us from <HI>Blood-guiltiness.</HI></P>
<P>AND now <HI>David,</HI> If it may please God to Deliver <HI>thee</HI> from the Guilt of that Blood which <HI>thou hast shed,</HI> thou wilt <HI>for ever Praise and Sing of his Par∣doning Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>O the <HI>Glory</HI> of Divine Grace in par∣doning such Guilt as thine is! O the <HI>Glory</HI> that may redound to GOD for ever in <HI>thy</HI> Salvation!

The Glory of the Divine <HI>Ho∣liness</HI> in the Forgiveness of Sin thro' the Blood of Christ, the <HI>Justice</HI> of God having received full Satisfaction there∣by; So that God <HI>can be Just, and yet the Justifier of all them that Believe!</HI> The Glory of the <HI>Power</HI> also of Re∣newing <HI>Grace,</HI> whereby God is <HI>able to subdue</HI> all things to himself; and to

Soften, Sanctifie, &amp; Change thy Heart!

<P>If thou hast any <HI>Hope</HI> that God <HI>has</HI> pardoned thy Sin, I'm sure thou must <HI>needs adore</HI> and bless, extol and mag∣nifie the Mercy of God in Christ.
