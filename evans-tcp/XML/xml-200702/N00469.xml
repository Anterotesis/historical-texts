<HEAD>A Faithful Warning &amp; Exhortation to Friends.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu know how that God in his infinite Love hath visited us with a very glorious Day, in which his Son of Righ∣teousness is so r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en upon us that the heavenly warm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h thereof hath quickened and enlivened us, and made us to stand up and serve him in our Day and Generation; and the Virtue of that blessed Life in Christ Jesus being revealed in the Souls of them who have truly believed, hath given them great Power over Death, and hath made them able to grapple with Satan in all his divers appearances, and to overcome him; so that which way soever he hath hitherto sought to ecclipse the Glory and Brightness of this great and notable day of the Lord, he hath hitherto been frustrated in his purpose, and his Instruments have been made ashamed of their Work; for all that are true Children of the day, do find that their standing is by Faith, and not by Knowledge, and are by their Faith kept in a holy depen∣dance upon the Power of him that can overcome all things, and bring them under; so that whatever doth arise against the Truth the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h of them that are in it, lets them, even in the beginning of it, see to the end of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; gives them a certainty in themselves, by which they are settled in patient and quiet waiting to see the thing they believe brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o pass; and this is their Victory, even their Faith, and who dwells in this Faith, are not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry, neither do they faint in all the various Exercises they meet with∣al in the way, but can endure Contradiction without discourage∣ment, knowing, that whatever it is that ris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th up against the Power and Purpose of God, shall in time be laid low.</P>
<P>And this is the same Faith that was once delivered to the Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uts in the primitive days, when Christ the Resurrection and
<PB N="4" REF="000592_0003_0FA95B1E86BB9A30"/>

<P>Now when the Devil saw that it was impossible to stop this glorious work of God, by all he could do, by stirring up the Priests and Rulers against them, but their strength was in the Lord, they standing in their simplicity and pureness of Mind; then the Adversary sought out ways, means and instruments how to disturb their progress, by drawing one or other among them∣selves from that simplicity of the Gospel of Christ, in which they had been of one heart, and had believed and practised the same things, without vain Disputations, and having found some un∣stable Souls fit for his purpose, he wrought powerfully in them to move Questions, which had a tendency to draw others forth to striving about the Question, then one would have it THUS, and the other would maintain it to be SO, neither of them minding whether the Question it self tended to the use of edi∣fying the Church; but a great stir was quickly raised, and that about some few Jewish Rites, and about some right or wrong Descents in Geneologys, one would prove it <HI>Thus,</HI> and the other <HI>So;</HI> and here was a door opened to let in the Carnal Wisdom▪ to be the Weapons of this War, by which the pure innocent Minds of many were corrupted, and some whole Housholds subverted; which when the Devil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad thus far

prevailed, he went no further, and gave Courage to some of these his High-minded, Heady, Unruly Servants to go abroad through the Churches, and preach up these his Questions, as Doctrines, and to seduce and draw away who they could from the simplicity of the Gospel, and these were so prevalent as to be witch and betray many; so that they were imboldned to withstand the true Apostles in that glorious work in which Christ Jesus had imployed them; so that now a great deal of their work was to warn the poor flock of Christ of these Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing, and to give our Testimonies of their own sincerity, and against these deceitful Workers▪ and to open and unfold the mysterious working of that evil Spirit, &amp; how it wrought cunningly to make void the Offence of the Cross, that they might carry on the Name and outward Pro∣fession of Christianity, with more Reputation &amp; less Reproach than at the first, for this was the design, to get the Christians into a false Liberty, and to loosen their hearts from that sin∣cerity and watchfulness which was taught them in the begin∣ning, and to what a height the subtil Serpent carried on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> work in that day, you may read at large in the Scriptures of Truth, and what sad &amp; woful work it made in <HI>Corinth,</HI> in <HI>Galati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in <HI>Thiatyra,</HI> and in <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicea,</HI> and also in <HI>Achaia,</HI> and what sorrow and labour it cost the good Apostles, and how the good Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was grieved by these things, and the Hearts of the Righteous made sad thereby.</P>
<P>Yet the Enemy had in those days another Stratagem as bad as all the rest whereby he sought to lay waste the work of God; for after the Gospel came to spread abroad, &amp; many were con∣vinced, both <HI>Jews</HI> &amp; <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntiles,</HI> many <HI>Greeks</HI> also came to acknow∣ledge the Truth who had been great seekers after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atural Wis∣dom, and had sought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o fathom natural Causes &amp; Effects, and had studied many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urious Arts and Philosophick Strains and methods, which suited well with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Heathenish Worship &amp; Religion, for them to endeavour to find out the benevolent or malevolent Influences of Mars, Saturn, upit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the other

of the Gods whom they worshipped; but when they came to the acknowled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent of the one only true and living God, the Creator of all, and of Jesus Christ whom he had sent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound their curious Arts needless, and their Books fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or nothing but the fire, and burnt in one City as many as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re worth, 50000 pieces of Silver: But alas! the Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of them was not burnt in several, but wrought cunningly to bring many of those their Tricks and Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n among the poor Believers, and endeavoured to make them believe they were such knowing men, and had such rare things to acquaint them with, far beyond the Apostles, and then they went to work with the Opposition of Science (as they falsly cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed it) and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very thing must be questioned and disputed that had not a Philosophick or Natural Reason, to demonstrate to the Senses or Understanding: and, hereby was the Faith of some made void, and many were spoiled of their Sincerity and Up∣rightness by these vain deceits, and then came in looseness in Conversation; then, a <HI>Nicholas</HI> with his <HI>Ranterism,</HI> a <HI>Jez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bel</HI> with her <HI>pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended loose</HI> and <HI>wanton Prophecy's;</HI> a <HI>Balaam</HI> with his <HI>Covetous Design</HI> upon the People, might find some to side with them: for the holy Tye &amp; Covenant of their Religion of bear∣ing a daily Cross that was broken; but alas! alas! the effect of these things was very lamentable.</P>
<P>And <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> having briefly touched at these things, &amp; set these Proceedings of Satan against the Truth among the pri∣mitive <HI>Christians</HI> before you, I now come to tell you in great plainness &amp; since i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what hath for some Months lain upon my Mind relating to this subject, and concerning the day in which we live, and the Dispensation of that Everlasting Gospel which is now preached again unto us, in which we found the very same blessed Effects as they did; for when we had believed therein, it brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into great Simplicity, and into cleanness of Mind, and into an unfeigned Love and Unity one with another; and
<PB N="7" REF="000592_0006_0FA95B23C7E024D0"/>
from what Parts or Countries soever w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came, we all spake the same things, and the querking, querying, disputing Wit was brought down &amp; cast out from among us, tho' we could query and dispute the Opposers that were without in defence of the Truth, yet we had then no such occasion among them that pro∣fessed Truth; for we were of one Heart, Mind and Judgment, and in that universal Love we laboured to build up one another in our most holy Faith, and to publish and make known the blessed Name of Jesus, in whom we had believed, and many were daily added to the Church, and came to partake of the same Faith and of the same Love, &amp; grew into the same simplicity of Mind, wherein we found a harmonious rejoycing in Spirit when ever we saw one another: In this state did the Truth preserve us, and our Faith, was firm in that Name &amp; Power by which we were called, that the Lord would go before us and prosper us in his blessed Way, in which he caused our Souls to take great de∣light, and take up the daily Cross cheerfully, and deny our selves for the sake of him that called us.</P>
<P>But the old Enemy of Truth envy'd this our tranquility quick∣ly, and began to work in some where he found a ground to work in, and sought to lead them from the simplicity of the Truth, &amp; to exalt their minds in the sight of things opened by the Truth, and so did not abide in the tender fear of God, and in the humi∣lity of the innocent Seed, but flew up into airy Notions &amp; Ima∣ginations, some into a false L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berty, and others into strange Ima∣ginations of their own growth to some high state, and so gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unruly, and were ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dned, against Exhortations; rather judging themselves fit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each▪ than to be taught, and these drew several after them, through an affection that was not subject to the Cross and became an occasion of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fence &amp; Stum∣bling to many who were enquiring after the Way of the Lord, and a great exercise &amp; sorrow to such as kept in the Travail and Labour for <HI>Sion's</HI> Redemption; but those that abode in the faith, knew that the Power in which they had believed, would arise,
<PB N="8" REF="000592_0007_0FA95B2539E63078"/>
and crush down &amp; bruise under that lofty airy Spirit, &amp; all that abode in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and did not repent &amp; return to their <HI>first love,</HI> and <HI>do their first Works,</HI> and according as we believed it came to pass, &amp; their works with which they sought to amuse and astonish the Nations, were confounded &amp; brought to nought, &amp; divers that did adhear &amp; cleave to that spirit, were lost &amp; scat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grew into Prophanness and Uncleanness, and strove against the Power of God that wrought in his People, to reclaim and regain them, till at length the very Power of God turned against them and cut them off who had been the Troublers.</P>
<P>Yet did not the Serpent leave off attempting to betray the In∣nocent, but found out other Instruments fit for his purpose, whom he raised up under pretence of some <HI>New D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scoveries,</HI> ac∣companied with a voluntary Humility, &amp; a seeming Self-denyal, when indeed the design was to <HI>Exalt Self and Mans Work, Wit and Reason, above the Eternal Power of God,</HI> and through feigned Pretences to obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dominion over the Heritage of God, &amp; to impose and ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rude upon them things which were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taught by the living Spirit, Christ, Jesus in themselves, nor had received by Doctrine nor Message from the true spiritual Labourers in the Gospel, by which means the Minds of many were betray'd, &amp; they were exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cised in contending about some outward signs or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their seperation till the weighty matter they should have minded, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>How to be kept in the love of God, and in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heavenly Unity,</HI> was in a great many lost and forgotten, and in∣stead thereof a secret Root of Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terness grew up, and a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red against the Prosperity of the Church of God, and the faithful Servants and Ministers of it, insomuch that they lost the very fence of Gods blessed Presence amongst us, and reckoned he had fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aken us, and thereupon many of them also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orsook us, and were as another People, and were puffed up with great Expecta∣tions of our downfall, and their own Exaltation, and began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their design o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peration</HI> into other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations, to the hurt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them▪ so that the render Love

O this is a sad Condition! and I have often with deep sorrow lamented the state of some, to whose hands peradventure this may come, when I have seen what a <HI>good beginning</HI> they have made in the way of God, and have been as <HI>pleasant plants,</HI> &amp; hope∣ful to bring forth much fruit to the honour of God and comfort of his People, and especially to the comfort and salvation of their own immortal Souls; and yet after some good progress made in the Lords way, for want of a diligent watchfulness and keeping close to the daily Cross &amp; Self-denyal, have laid themselves open to the spoilers, who have cunningly got an entrance into them, some in the <HI>affectionate party,</HI> some in the <HI>wise reasoning party,</HI> som through <HI>sowing the seeds of prejudice,</HI> and some <HI>one way,</HI> and some <HI>another,</HI> and have beguiled them of the simplicity, and drawn them from the sincerity that is in the Truth; and so they have both lost their <HI>first love</HI> and their <HI>first Works</HI> also.</P>

<P>And <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> I might go into particulars to lay before you wherein this decay of love &amp; zeal for God and his precious Truth is manifest in many, but I spare you, knowing there is a faithful and true Witness for the Lord, that will (if you mind it) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew you more particularly wherein any hath failed, and to that Witness of God I do recomme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d what I have written to you, which will testifie that I have written in true love to your Im∣mortal Souls.
