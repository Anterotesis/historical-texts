<HEAD>A SERMON, ON THE Execution of <HI>Bryan Sheehen.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. vi.23.</HI></BIBL>
<P>FOR the Wages of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle having, in this chapter, repre∣sented the obligations Christians are under to avoid sin and lead a virtuous life; he, in the close of it, declares the different ends of the righte∣ous and wicked: how happy one will be, and how miserable the other. See the two verses immediately preceeding our text, <HI>What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruits unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</HI> And here our text follows— <HI>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eter∣nal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable here, that the punishment of the wicked is called wages, to shew that it is the just de∣merit of their crimes; and that the reward of the righteous, is called the gift of God through Jesus Christ, to shew that it is not merited by their good works, but is a free gift procured for them by Jesus Christ, the great Mediator between God and man.— It is observable also, that the punishment of the wicked is called Death, and the reward of the righteous Life, to shew the greatness both of the one and of the other:
<PB N="6" REF="012375_0004_0F893F1F638CA988"/>
It being usual in scripture to express the greatest hap∣piness by life, and the greatest misery by death; life being the greatest of blessings, as it is the foundation of all others, and death the greatest of evils to those who have their portion in this world, not only as it is painful and terrible in itself, but also as it deprives them of all their enjoyments, and fixeth them in a state of misery, which is the natural consequence as well as punishment of their sins.</P>
<P>Our text, as it stands connected with the preceed∣ing context, will lead to the consideration of the fol∣lowing things.</P>
<P>That the end of a wicked life, will be everlasting misery. And</P>
<P>That this is the due wages, or just demerit of the sinners crimes.</P>
<P>That the end of a religious life, will be eternal happiness. And</P>
<P>That this is, in no measure, merited by the good works of the righteous, but is the free gift of God. And</P>
<P>That this unspeakable gift, is procured for them▪ by Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>
<P>The first thing to be considered is,</P>
<P>That the end of a wicked life will be everlasting misery; that is, to those who continue in their wick∣edness, and die without repentance. Some repent, and apply to Christ, and through him, obtain for∣giveness. Yea God is some times pleased, to give re∣pentance to those, who have lived in a long course of sin; and have been guilty of very heinous transgressi∣ons; even such as the wisdom of human govern∣ments, has thought fit to punish with death. I say God is sometimes pleased, in great mercy to such, to give them grace to repent and receive an offered Sa∣viour, and then they are plucked as brands out of the burning, and made happy forever. But when sinners
<PB N="7" REF="012375_0005_0F893F2025D52670"/>
refuse to be reclaimed, and continue in their sins till they leave the world; there is then nothing for them but <HI>a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indigna∣tion to devour them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x.27.</NOTE> They then <HI>go away into everlast∣ing punishment,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxv.46.</NOTE> and <HI>suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jude 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>By death, in our text, may be implied temporal as well as eternal death: For that is also the wages of sin; as appears not only from that threatening of God to Adam—<HI>In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,</HI> but also from what is said in Rom. v.12. <HI>As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</HI></P>
<P>And an untimely, violent, and ignominious death is the wages of those atrocious crimes, which render the committers of them dangerous to others, and pests to society: Or when the public good requires their being made examples of, for a terror to others. This is the punishment which they receive from men. But this, how severe and terrible soever it may seem, is no∣thing to that, which if they die impenitent, they will re∣ceive, more immediately from the hand of God. For, what is mainly intended by death, in our text, is eternal misery; as appears by its being put in opposition to eternal life: And from the same opposition in Mat. xxv.46. where it is also expresly said to be everlasting, <HI>these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The same greek word is here used to express the duration both of the happiness of the righteous and misery of the wicked.</NOTE> And it is not only asserted here, but in many other places of scripture, where it is called <HI>everlasting destruction</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Thes. i.9.</NOTE>—<HI>eternal damnation</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Mark iii.29.</NOTE>—<HI>and everlasting shame and contempt.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Dan. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii.2.</NOTE> And sinners are said to be punished, in <HI>everlasting burnings</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxxiii.14.</NOTE>—<HI>in fire that is never quenched</HI><NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Mark ix.43, 44▪ 45, 46, 48.</NOTE>—<HI>in blackness of darkness forever</HI><NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Jude 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>—<HI>and the smoke of their torment is</HI> said to <HI>ascend forever and ever.</HI><NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv.11.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012375_0006_0F893F20E3185830"/>It appears from these passages of scripture, that the punishment of the wicked, in another world will not only be everlasting, but exceeding great in degree: Since it is represented by that which is capable of putting us to the greatest misery in this world; namely, burning in the hottest fire. And as their torment will be exquisite, so it seems it will be without inter∣mission or mitigation: They will not be allowed so much as a <HI>drop of water to cool their tongues.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi.23, 24, 25.</NOTE> And into this dreadful state of exquisite and everlasting misery, sinners pass as soon as they leave the world. They go, with Judas, to their own place <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts i.25.</NOTE> and in hell they lift up their eyes being in torment.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding this punishment is thus great and everlasting; yet</P>
<P>It is but the due wages and just demerit of the sin∣ner's crimes. It is what God has ordered, and therefore must be just and right: And what the sinner will not have the least reason to complain of.—Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? If any should enquire, how it can consist with the justice of God, to punish temporary crimes with eternal misery let them consider,</P>
<P>That the dignity of the person against whom a crime is committed, greatly inhances the crime. The same crime, as to the matter of it, is much greater when committed against a king, than when committed against one of our fellow subjects: And doubtless the same crime committed against God, riseth in propor∣tion to his superiority and dignity above a temporal king: And in the same proportion, the punishment of it may be justly increased. 1 Sam. ii.25. If one man sin against another, the Judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? Again, let them consider,</P>
<P>That God sets before men, life and death, rewards and punishments, and deals with them according to
<PB N="9" REF="012375_0007_0F893F21A3701908"/>
their own free choice: And that this is agreeable to justice, cannot be denied. We have the offer of eter∣nal happiness, for a short life of obedience, as well as the threatening of eternal misery, for a short life of sin: And it is not only left to us which we will chuse, but various powerful means are used with us to induce us to avoid death and misery, and to chuse life and happiness; and if after all we chuse death, and wilfully expose ourselves to the threatened punishment; is it not just in God to let us have our choice, and leave us to suffer the sad effects of our folly? To use the words of another—
<Q>Since the rewards and punish∣ments are both eternal, the terms on both sides are equal; and since it is in our power, by the help of divine grace, to avoid the punishment, and to ob∣tain the reward, the condition is such, as any wise man would be thankful for; far from complaining, that the terrors of punishment are joined to the en∣couragements of reward; that all motives concur to make him happy; and that God, in his great mer∣cy, has used all means, both inward by his grace, and outward by his threats and promises, to bring him to salvation.</Q>
Once more, let them consider,</P>
<P>That it seems to have been necessary, that eternal punishment should be threatened against the violaters of the divine laws, since a less punishment would not have been sufficient to secure man's obedience to them. We see, now eternal misery is threatened, it is not sufficient, with the greatest part of mankind, to deter them from sin; and if a less punishment had been threatened, it would have had a proportionably less influence. And God's end in threatening is not that he may punish, but that he might prevent men's wick∣edness, which hath a necessary connection with misery; and to excite them to a religious life, the end whereof is happiness. Since then God's goodness was the foundation of his threatenings, it was certainly just for
<PB N="10" REF="012375_0008_0F893F2263DB7568"/>
him to threaten as he hath done; and if it was just for him to threaten, then it is just for him to execute his threatenings; and that he will execute them, ap∣pears from his truth and veracity; Num. xxiii.19. <HI>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the Son of man, that he should repent; hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</HI> Thus it appears that the wicked will be punished, in the world to come, with everlasting misery; and that this is the due wages, and just demerit, of their crimes.— I now proceed to the next thing proposed, which was to shew,</P>
<P>That the end of a life of piety and virtue, in this world, will be eternal happiness, in the world to come. This also, God, who is truth itself, hath declared and promised. See the verse immediately preceeding our text,—<HI>But now being made free from sin, and become ser∣vants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</HI> And Mat. xxvth chap. and last verse, <HI>These shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous unto life eternal.</HI> By life eternal, is not only intended, a state of eternal existence, for so the wicked will live forever; but by it is intended, a state of ever∣lasting happiness. When the righteous leave this world, they leave all sorrow and trouble with it, and enter into an unchangeable state of ease, comfort and happiness. They go into <HI>God's presence,</HI> where there <HI>is fullness of joy,</HI> and are placed <HI>at his right hand,</HI> where there <HI>are pleasures forever more.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Psal. x<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vi.11.</NOTE> Their happiness is not only eternal, but compleat and perfect. All their desires are satisfied; yea, they have more than heart can wish. <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,</HI> nor is the heart of man, (while in this world) capable of con∣ceiving <HI>the good things, which God hath laid up for them that love him.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing proposed was to shew, that this glorious and eternal state of happiness, is in no mea∣sure
<PB N="11" REF="012375_0009_0F893F2323000D70"/>
merited by the good works of the righteous, but is the free gift of God. The Pharisees among the Jews, thought they could do God much service, and merit a reward of him, by their good works. And the Papists among Christians, hold the same doctrine now. But this is a vain notion, and without the least foundation, either in reason or scripture; but what is plainly condemned by both. Reason tells us, that as we are God's creatures, and depend entirely on him for life, breath, and all things, all the service we can possibly render him, is most justly due to him. And therefore that when we have done our utmost, we can∣not demand a reward of him, for what we have done, any more, than we can demand a reward of our neighbour for paying him a debt, which we justly owed him. The scriptures also plainly teach us the same; Luke xvii.7—10. <HI>Which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him by and by, when he cometh from the field, go and sit down to meat? And will not rather say unto him, make ready wherewith I may sup▪ and gird thyself and serve me, 'till I have eaten and drank, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink. Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all these things that are commanded you; say, we are unprofitable servants; we have done that which was our duty to do.</HI> As we are God's servants, all our time, strength, and abilities—all we have and are, are his; and therefore we should be constantly employed in his service. And when we are so, we do but our duty, and must say, we are unprofitable servants. This we ought to say, if we did all that is commanded us, which we know we never do; and therefore we are not only unprofitable, but sinful, dis∣obedient servants. There is none that doeth good, and sinneth not. And therefore instead of meriting any thing at God's hands, we stand in continual need of his pardoning mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012375_0010_0F893F23E24529B0"/>All the good things therefore which we receive at God's hands (or in other words, all we enjoy, for we receive all from him) are the effects of his free grace and bounty. Not unto us therefore, not unto us— but to his name the praise is due.</P>
<P>The last thing proposed, was to shew,</P>
<P>That this unspeakable gift of eternal life, was pro∣cured for us by Jesus Christ our Lord. We are all sinners; and sin is the transgression of the law; the penalty whereof is death. The soul that sinneth shall die; that is, be miserable forever.</P>
<P>By Sin we had ruined and destroyed ourselves, but in God and Christ was our help found. <HI>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who∣soever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlast∣ing life.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii.16.</NOTE> Christ, the blessed Son of God, came into the world, and suffered and died, to <HI>make reconciliation for iniquity,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix.24.</NOTE> <HI>and bring in everlasting righteousness.</HI> He suffered—<HI>the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii.18.</NOTE> <HI>Christ is the way, the truth and the life,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">John xiv.6.</NOTE> and <HI>there is no other name under heaven, whereby we can be saved.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts iv.12.</NOTE> God hath given us <HI>the promise of eternal life</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 John, ii.15.</NOTE> but <HI>this life is in the Son. He that hath the Son, hath life; but he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life</HI>;<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1 John v.12.</NOTE> <HI>but the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now make some improvement of what has been thus briefly said on this subject, And</P>
<P N="1">1. Will the end of a sinful life, be eternal death and misery? How exceeding foolish then are they who lead such a life! And alas! how many such are there! What multitudes <HI>live, as without God in the world, and as if they were made to serve divers lusts and pleasures?</HI>— are under no restraint▪ but <HI>commit all manner of sin with greediness</HI> How strange is it that rational crea∣tures,
<PB N="13" REF="012375_0011_0F893F2588968450"/>
should act so mad and foolish a part! Sinners may flatter themselves, <HI>that they shall have peace though they walk in the imaginations of their hearts, adding drunk∣enness to thirst</HI>; and to that innumerable other abomi∣nations; but as sure as God is just, and his word true, they <HI>shall not,</HI> unless they repent, and secure an interest in Christ, <HI>escape the damnation of hell.</HI> Oh con∣sider where the way you are in will lead you; even down to the regions of eternal woe and misery! <HI>the lake which burns with fire and brimstone</HI>; into which you must soon inevitably fall, unless you alter your course. And oh! be persuaded immediately to <HI>break off from your sins by repentance, and from your iniquities, by turning unto God. Turn ye—turn ye, for why will ye die</HI> and be miserable forever.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is eternal misery the due wages, and just demerit of sin? This shews the evil nature and great maligni∣ty of it. For how vile a thing must that be, which deserves so great a punishment? God who knows the true nature of things, is represented in scripture as having the greatest hatred to sin: It is stiled <HI>the abo∣minable thing which his soul hates.</HI> Shall not we then detest and abhor it, and use our utmost endeavours to avoid it? When we are tempted to sin, let us tremble at the thought; and say, with Joseph, <HI>how shall we do this great wickedness, and sin against God!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Is this punishment but the due wages, and just desert of sin? We hence see, who the wretched Inha∣bitants of hell must blame, that they are thus miserable. They will be without excuse: Their own consciences will condemn them; and they will have none to blame but themselves, that this awful punishment is inflicted on them. They will see that their condemnation is perfectly just; and that it is entirely their own fault that they perish. And Oh! What an aggravation will it be of their misery, to act on their folly and madness, in thus ruining and destroying themselves.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="012375_0012_0F893F262C914188"/>4. Is eternal life the gift of God, how great then is his goodness? And what gratitude, thanksgiving and praise are due to him, from all who have the offer of it? We have forfeited all favour at God's hands; and deserve nothing but misery and destruction: And yet he offers us unspeakable and everlasting happiness, on the easy terms of the gospel. What obligations are we then under to him! Shall we not <HI>love him with all our heart, and soul, and mind, and strength?</HI> Shall we not <HI>praise him, while we live, and give thanks unto him, as long as we have a being?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Is eternal life the gift of God, thro' Jesus Christ? Let us then seek for it as such. Let us look upon it as what Christ hath procured for us, by what, in his great condescension and goodness, he has done and suffered for us. And let us apply to the Father, in his name, for it. Let us not think to merit it, by any thing we can do. For alas! What can we do? Our very best performances are attended with sin.— And if they were not, they are but our duty; and we are still unprofitable servants. But as they are at∣attended with sin; the wages of that sin, is death and misery; we are by that sin, transgressors of the law; and by the law we cannot be justified, for it condemns us: It <HI>curses every one that continues not in all things that are written therein to do them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii.10.</NOTE> We all lie at mercy. If ever we are saved, it must be by grace, thro' Christ. <HI>By grace,</HI> saith the apostle, <HI>are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ii.8.</NOTE> We should look upon ourselves as lost, and undone by sin; and as destitute of all help, and hope, but in the mercy of God, and the merits of Jesus Christ. And we should give up all self-dependence, and rely en∣tirely on God's mercy, in the Redeemer, for pardon, grace and glory. And Oh! How earnest should we be in our supplications to the throne of grace; that God would be pleased, to behold us in his Son,
<PB N="15" REF="012375_0013_0F893F26E3B66908"/>
and extend his mercy to us, through him, without which, me must perish everlastingly? Those lines of Mr. Sternhold (however inconsiderable his skill in poetry was) have been admired, by some celebrated masters of that art, as being most expressive of the absolute need, poor guilty sinners, as we all are, stand in of the divine mercy; and of the fervency and earnestness, with which we should pray for it.</P>
<Q><L>Mercy, good Lord! Mercy I crave:</L>
<L>This is the total sum.</L>
<L>For mercy Lord, is all my suit:</L>
<L>Lord, let thy mercy come.</L></Q>
<P>May we all entertain these sentiments, and adopt this language; or language equivalent. May we imitate the humble Publican; who, not presuming to lift up his face before God, bowed his guilty head, and smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. In this way, we may hope to be heard, and justified, as he was.</P>
<P>And in this way, <HI>Bryan Sheehen,</HI> you must look for salvation, if you expect to obtain it. You acknow∣ledge you are a great sinner; and the wages of sin, you see, is death; that is, exquisite and everlasting mi∣sery. And this punishment, though inexpressibly great and awful, is but the due wages, and just deme∣rit of a sinner's crimes. It is what he really deserves. Since God has threatened it, and has expresly declared he will inflict it; we may depend upon it, it is just and right. Now to this awful punishment you are exposed; and this you must suffer; yea and in a few hours enter into, unless God delivers you from it.— And what reason have you to expect this great de∣liverance? God has expresly told us, that unless a sinner repents, he shall perish. But have you repented? I wish—heartily wish, I could tell you, I really thought you was a true penitent; but I am constrained to say, thus much at least, that I stand in great doubt of you.
<PB N="16" REF="012375_0014_0F893F27A4E678E0"/>
I think you have not, as yet, discovered sufficient marks of real repentance. You have not appeared to have that lively sense of your sin and danger, and of the great things of religion, and another world, which might reasonably be expected, from one in your cir∣cumstances. And what is most discouraging of all is, your denying the main fact, for which you are con∣demned;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He own'd he was guilty of Adultery, but not of a Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> though it was proved to the full satisfaction both of the Judges and Jury, and almost all who heard your trial.</P>
<P>And if you have not repented, but still lie under the guilt of all your sins—how sad is your case!—How awful your condition!—Within a few hours of death and the eternal world; and in a temper of mind, fit only for the company of devils and damned spirits in hell. I don't say this, <HI>Bryan,</HI> to reproach you—far be it from me. I do it, that I may, if possible, now at length, rouse and awaken you to a proper sense of your condition; and excite you to use your utmost endeavours, to prepare for that great and awful change, which is so very near you, and which will determine your state forever. I pity you from my heart, and almost tremble to consider your danger.—There is, I believe, hardly a person, in this great as∣sembly, but pities you: And every christian, I trust, prays for you. And while others are thus concerned for you; is it possible that you should not be greatly concerned for yourself—for your own immortal soul, now on the borders of the eternal world; and, it is to be feared, on the brink of hell!—That <HI>lake which burns with fire and brimstone forever.</HI> One would think, that the thoughts of your danger would make you shudder; and cause every joint in you, to tremble.— For, if the king of Babylon trembled, when he saw the hand-writing on the wall, though he knew not what it was, but only imagined, from a consciousness of his guilt, that it was a threatening against himself,
<PB N="17" REF="012375_0015_0F893F286429CC18"/>
or a sign of his approaching ruin; I say, if this great <HI>king's countenance was then changed, and his thoughts so troubled him,</HI> that <HI>the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smite out against another</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. v.6.</NOTE> what reason have you to tremble, when you know your days are now numbered and finished, and that death, a change awful and important beyond all conception, is so near you? If Felix trembled, when Paul reasoned of judgment to come; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv.25.</NOTE> what reason have you to tremble, now you are just going to appear before your Judge; and to receive a sentence, perhaps, to a state of woe and misery, unutterable and everlasting? Oh! <HI>Sheehen,</HI> be persuaded, by these <HI>terrors of the Lord,</HI> to exert your∣self to the utmost, in preparing for death, judgment, and eternity. Improve the short space, God is yet giving you, with the greatest diligence. Your case, it is true, is exceeding hazardous and difficult; and if you are saved, it will be out of God's usual way. But we have reason to believe, he is sometimes pleased to shew mercy to sinners, even at the last hour. So it is supposed the thief on the cross was saved.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is to be feared that this instance of success in the thief on the cross, has been abused by many to their eternal ruin. To prevent this in others, let them consider, that some suppose he might repent some time before, while he was in goal, though it was not publicly known till he hung on the cross. But if his repentance did not commence, 'till he was on the cross, and so just going out of the world: Though it may give some grounds of hope to sinners, when brought to this last extremity; especially if they have been under disadvantages in their education and way of life, and sinned in a great measure through igno∣rance; yet it gives no manner of encouragement to any, purposely to continue in their sins, and put off their repentance to the last, with a dependance on God's mercy to save them, when they can indulge their lusts no longer. This is such a vile abuse of God's goodness, and so heinously wicked, that it may provoke him to cut them off suddenly in their sins, or to deprive them of their reason when first seized with their last sickness, or before they apprehend their danger: or to refuse to hear them when they cry to him, in their distress and anguish; agreeable to that righteous▪ but awful threatening of his, which I earnestly intreat all sinners seriously to consider, and lay to heart: Prov. xxiv.20. "Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me."</NOTE> Don't

despair then, and give yourself up as lost. While there is life, there is some reason to hope. God's mer∣cy is great; and Christ's blood is sufficient to cleanse from all sin. Though your time is short, God can enable you to do much in this short time. In an af∣fair of such infinite importance, a bare possibility of success, should be a sufficient motive to the most vi∣gorous exertions. And the greater the difficulty and danger are, the more earnest should men be in their endeavours. Oh then! strive with your might—be <HI>fervent in spirit,</HI> in this most momentous affair. Look back upon your past life, and call to mind as many of your sins as you can; and confess and lament them before God, and strive to be humble and penitent.— And let me once more remind you, that you cannot be a true penitent, unless you undo what you have done amiss, as far as it is in your power. And there∣fore if what you have hitherto said of the woman, who accused you, be false; if you do not unsay it, but per∣sist in it to the last, there is no hope for you; but you must be miserable forever: For <HI>all liars, shall have their part, in the lake that burns with fire and brim∣stone forever.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi.8.</NOTE> Oh then! if you love your own soul, don't go out of the world, under the guilt of falshood; nor of any other sin; for the least sin, unrepented of, will be sufficient to shut you out of heaven, and plunge you into hell. Confess and lament, all your sins before God: Not only those that have been more immediately against him; but those, whereby you have injured your neighbour, and yourself. They are all transgressions of God's law, and must be hear∣tily repented of. And pray earnestly for forgiveness through Christ, and for the renewing and sanctifying influences of the divine spirit—pray without ceasing▪ and call upon others to pray for you. But here, let me give you a caution.—Though you must do these
<PB N="19" REF="012375_0017_0F893F29E4DC89E8"/>
things; yet you must not trust in them as meritori∣ous; that is, as what you can earn, or purchase par∣don and happiness by. Whatever you have been taught, in your younger years; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was educated a Papist.</NOTE> you may depend upon it, there is no proper merit in any thing you, or I, or any person on earth can do. Eternal life is the gift of God, through Jesus Christ. Seek for it then as such: As what you are utterly unworthy of; and what you depend entirely on God, and Christ for. God hath given his Son, and his Son hath suffered and died, to make way for the bestowment of it, on those, who apply for it, with a humble, penitent, prayerful dependence on Christ. God pardons sin, and receives sinners to favour and happiness, not for any worthi∣ness in them, but on the account of what Christ has done and suffered. <HI>Christ is the way, the truth and the life; none can come to the Father but by him.</HI> Apply then in Christ's name, and make mention of his righteousness only. Bow your soul before God, and acknowledge you have forfeited all favour at his hands, and deserve nothing but destruction; but beg of him to spare you for Christ's sake, who is worthy though you are unworthy. Consider yourself, as lost, and undone by sin; and as destitute of all help, but from God, through Christ. And cast yourself on the mercy of God in Jesus Christ. <HI>Look to him, whom God hath set forth to be the propitiation for our sins, to Jesus Christ, that lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. There is salvation in no other; neither is there any name given among men, whereby we can be saved, but Christ</HI>'s. Look to him then, by faith; trust in his merits; and commit your soul into his hands, to be saved by him, in his own appointed way.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This, says Dr. Doddridge, is the great act of saving faith. See his Book en∣titled▪ The rise and progress of religion in the soul, page 69, a book which I heartily wish was in every family in the province, and throughout the land.</NOTE> And the Lord have mercy on you, and work in you true re∣pentance,
<PB N="20" REF="012375_0018_0F893F2AA3549228"/>
and a proper trust in, and dependence upon the merits at Christ; and for his sake pardon you, and receive you into favour; and renew and sanctify you, and give you an heavenly frame and temper of mind; that so, though your body must die, your soul may live, and be happy forever.</P>
<P>I would now call upon all sinners, here present, to take warning, by the unhappy prisoner before them. You see what sin hath brought him to; and what it may bring you to, if you persist in it.</P>
<P>It is by degrees that sinners are brought to com∣mit great and heinous sins. When the Prophet told Hazael, what he would do to the Israelites—that he would rip up their women with child, and dash their little ones against the stones: He cried out, What! is thy servant a dog, that he should do these things?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> Yet, by indulging himself in sin, he by degrees, grew bold and hardy enough, to do that, which he before seemed to abhor, and think it impossible he should ever be guilty of. Oh then, take care, that you do not get a habit of sinning? Don't venture to proceed any further in your evil ways; since you know not what monsters sin may soon make of you, if you should.</P>
<P>Let those who have been preserved from great and heinous transgressions, be thankful for God's restrain∣ing grace. Let young persons take care to preserve their innocence; and use their utmost endeavours to suppress the first motions to sin. Let those who have entered upon a course of sin, come to an immediate stand: and tremble at the thought, of proceeding any further! And may all sinners be enabled to see the in∣finite evil and danger of sin, and be excited immedi∣ately to break off from their sins by repentance, and from their iniquities, by turning unto God. And let all be careful to shun and guard against all temptations to, and occasions of sin, particularly those, which have
<PB N="21" REF="012375_0019_0F893F2B63083748"/>
proved so fatal to the poor criminal here before us.— Such as bad company, especially that of lewd women. Bad company in general is exceeding ensnaring and dangerous; and has been the ruin of multitudes: And as to a whorish woman—her house is the way to hell; going down to the chambers of death. Avoid intem∣perate drinking of spirituous liquors. This counter∣acts the great design of the divine law; which is to restrain men's lusts and passions, and make them act as becomes rational creatures. I say, intemperate drinking, in direct opposition to this, clouds and weak∣ens reason, and inflames men's lusts and passions, and makes them fit instruments of the devil, to accomplish his hellish designs. This ruins both the souls and bo∣dies of thousands and ten thousands; and, I believe, I may add millions! How lamentable is it then, that it is become so common among us? Abstain from the horrible sin of profane cursing and swearing. A sin which is highly provoking to Almighty God; and what greatly exposes persons to his awful judgments.</P>
<P>Neglect not the assembling of yourselves together, on the Lord's day, as the manner of too many among us is. This unhappy man owns, that for near twenty years past, he has seldom or never attended any pub∣lic worship, till now since his condemnation. If he had steadily attended the public worship, in all proba∣bility, such religious impressions would have been made on his mind, as would have prevented his perpetrating the heinous crime, for which he must now die. But the time will not permit me to enlarge.</P>
<P>To conclude,</P>
<P>Let all cease to do evil, and learn to do well. And let them do it immediately, since their time is short and uncertain. You pity the criminal, because he has but a short time—but a few hours to live. But consider—your time perhaps, may be as short, nay
<PB N="22" REF="012375_0020_0F893F2C22434550"/>
shorter than his! Instead of hours, you may have but a few minutes to live. So it has been with others, who have thought themselves as safe, as you think yourselves now; and of several, not far from us, since this man was condemned. They have been seized suddenly, when about their business, or perhaps at their diversions, and hurried, in a few moments, out of time, into eternity. Oh! consider your awful danger and provide against it, by repenting immediately, and securing an interest in Jesus Christ, and thereby a title to life and happiness. And the Lord make us all wise for our souls, and for eternity; and grant that whenever death comes, though it be never so soon or suddenly, we may be ready; and may die in peace, and sleep in Jesus; and in the morning of the resur∣rection, when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, we also may appear with him in glory, and so be forever with the Lord.</P>

<P>THE unhappy man, previous to whose execution the preceeding discourse was delivered, was born in Ireland▪ and educated in the principles of the Church of Rome. In his 20th year he came over to America, lived about a year at Boston, and then went to Casco-Bay, where he married, and had a number of children. His wife and all his children, except one, died some time before his tragical end. In the time of the last war, he was six years and an half in the army, and was finally at the taking of the Havannah. His business before and after this was that of a mariner. He was employed sometimes in the fishery, sometimes in the coasting business, and sometimes in foreign voyages. Though he appeared to be tolerably well acquainted with reading and writing, yet he was very ignorant in things of Religion, having almost entirely neglected the means of religious knowledge. For a number of years, he attended no publick worship, seldom looked into the bible, or any other book on religious subjects. And when he did read, he confined his reading, as he told me, to history and books of di∣version. In consequence of this, he was a most abandon'd sinner; living as without God in the world, and as if he had been made to serve divers lusts and pleasures. He was horribly profane; was addicted to intemperate drinking, whoring, lying, fighting and quarrelling, and almost all manner of wickedness; and finally was charged with, and convicted of the heinous crime which brought him to the gallows.</P>
<P>It appeared on his trial that he went up, in the middle of the night, to the room where Mrs. <HI>Hollowell</HI> lay, found her asleep, awaken her, and swore, if she made the least noise, he would kill her; and then stopping her mouth, perpe∣trated the atrocious crime. After which (to prevent, it seems, a pregnancy) he abused her with his hand, in an unheard-of, cruel and shocking man∣ner: Insomuch that her life was for some time almost despaired of; and she was not able for ten days after to get off her bed without help. It was observed by the honourable court, that they never had a cause of this kind before them, wherein the evidence against the criminal was more full and clear. Yet he de∣nied both the Rape and the abuse after it; and insisted that his living with her, which he owned, was by mutual agreement. This be persisted in during the whole time of his confinement in goal, and even to the last; though he was often urged to confess the truth, and put in mind of the dreadful consequence of going out of the world with a lie in his mouth. This has induced many to entertain hard thoughts of the woman, and to think more favourably of him: And many have said he ought not to have been hanged.</P>
<P>I think justice to the woman's character requires that this matter be set in its true light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He did not blame the Judges nor Jury; but said the evidence was so full against him, that he knew he should lose his life, long before his trial was over. He blamed only the woman, and the other witnesses.</NOTE> Let it then be considered; that though it be shocking to think of▪ yet there is no doubt but there have been instances of persons going out of the world denying the truth, and it is to be feared many.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Some no doubt endeavour to conceal their guilt, hoping thereby to obtain a reprieve, and entertaining this hope to the last, and fearing to confess their guilt, least they should prevent it, they die with a lie in their mouths.</NOTE> One such instance I suppose it is generally thought there was, not many years since, at Cambridge.— And considering <HI>Sheehen</HI>'s general character before his death, and especially what I have heard of him since, I should as readily believe it of him, as of any man I ever knew.</P>
<P>Some suppose he was drunk and did not know, and therefore could not re∣member what he did. But it is difficult to conceive how he should be drunk, as not to know what he did, and yet be capable of committing so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a crime. I am therefore more inclined to believe he was one of those hardened▪ daring wretches (as the man, who was hanged at Cambridge, was supposed to be) who venture to go out of the world denying the truth.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Some put an end to their own lives, and so venture to go out of the world under the awful guilt of Self-murder: And this, it is said, he himself sometimes talked of doing.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again, let it be considered, that notwithstanding he pretended to have renounced the errors of the church of Rome, yet he died a Papist. This appears from the testimony of an intimate friend of his, of the same religion; who was with him
<PB N="24" REF="012375_0022_0F893F2E68AA8D90"/>
in goal, and attended him at the gallows. Now we know one tenet of the church of Rome is, that they are not obliged, in some cases, to perform their most solemn vows to Hereticks▪ and he might possibly think that if he might swear falsely, he might doubtless speak falsely to Hereticks, as they call all whose religious principles differ from theirs.</P>
<P>Again, let it be considered that it appears evidently from scripture, that God is sometimes provoked to give heinous sinners up to blindness of mind and hard∣ness of heart—to leave them to the power of their lusts and of the devil. When they commence devils—contract the temper of the infernal spirits before they leave the world, and go to that place of punishment which is prepared for the devil and his angels. And when men are thus blinded and hardened, the mo∣tives and arguments of religion, have little or no influence on them. And that <HI>Sheehen</HI> was such an one, there is great reason to believe, not only from his general character, and behaviour in goal, but also from what I am now going to relate.</P>
<P>Two credible persons have, since his execution, informed me, that there was a young woman, daughter of one <HI>Williams,</HI> of Gouldsborough, in the Eastern part of this province, abused in the same manner Mrs. <HI>Hollowell</HI> was. That she was way-layed in the evening, between her father's house and a neighbour's; was seized, forced, and wounded to such a degree, that her friends were obliged to carry her home, she being unable to walk, and that the next morning early she died. That the villain, who perpetrated this crime, returned after he had done it, to his companions, who, it seem, were before, or then, made acquainted with his enterprize; for such wretches declare their sin as Sodom: And that one of them told him he would probably have a child to maintain: He answered no, that he had taken care to prevent that, and that she would never have a child by him, nor by any other man. That he was taken up, and confined in a private house, they having no goal, and that after two or three days, he made his escape. My informers were, at that time, both of them, at a place very near to Gouldsborough, heard the talk about the affair, and the man's name, and are pretty confident it was <HI>Bryan Sheehen.</HI> And they say, he was said to be an Irishman, and a married man, and that his wife was at Casco-Bay.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He mentioned to me his going a coasting from Casco to the Eastward, in a little boat owned by him and another man.</NOTE> Soon after this <HI>Sheehen</HI> left Casco-Bay (fearing, I imagine, he should be pursued and taken there) came to Marblehead, changed his name, and went a fishing from thence. While he was in goal, there was a man in town from Gouldsborough, or some place adjacent, who was asked if he knew the man that abused <HI>Williams</HI>'s daughter, in that cruel, fatal manner. He said he knew him well, that he had often seen him, and then described him: And the description answered pretty exactly to <HI>Sheehen.</HI> He was told there was a man in goal, who some thought might be the same man. He went to the goal, saw him, and when he returned, declared he was the same. Now if he was the man, and I think there is the highest proba¦bility that he was; there can be no doubt of his guilt with respect to Mrs. <HI>Hol∣lowell.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I was present when Mrs. <HI>Hollowell</HI> visited him in goal after his condemnation, and observed critically, not only what they said, but also their behaviour, and was of opinion that she talked and behaved much more like an innocent person than he did.</NOTE> And as I would hope there are not many such monsters upon earth, so I think it a favour that the earth is rid of him.</P>
<P>Let all hear, and fear and do no such wickedness. Oh consider the evil na∣ture and dreadful consequences of sin! Dreadful in this world, and infinitely more so in the world to come. Exhort one another daily, lest any be hardened thro' the deceitfulness of sin.—hardened past remedy—hardened to their ruin here, and eternal misery hereafter.</P>
<P>Let women consider their danger from whoremongers and adulterers: And let them be so far from trusting themselves in their power, as to shun and avoid them, as they would bears and tygers.</P>
<P>Let parents be careful to bring up their children in the fear of God. Let them consider of what vast importance this is. That if they are neglected in childhood and youth, they may contract such habits of sinning, as it will be as hard for them to break off, as it is for the Ethiopian to change his skin or the leopard his spots; whereas if they are trained up in the way of religion, they will be likely never to depart from it.</P>
<Q><L>Whatever turn you give the infant mind,</L>
<L>That way 'twill ever after be inclin'd.</L></Q>
