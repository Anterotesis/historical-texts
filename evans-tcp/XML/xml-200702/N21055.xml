<P>MENTORIA; OR THE YOUNG LADY'S FRIEND. IN TWO VOLUMES.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the foolish actions a person can commit, I think that of making an apology for a voluntary error, is the most ridiculous; therefore, tho' I have taken up my pen to write a pre∣face, I am utterly at a loss what to say.</P>
<P>If it is true that "Good wine needs no bush, and a good play no Epi∣logue," then must it be equally cer∣tain, that a good book requires no preface—and this assertion acknow∣ledged to be true, in what an awk∣ward
<PB N="ii" REF="027654_0004_0FD567CB50B3F488"/>
predicament do I stand, since to publish this work without a pre∣face, will be tacitly to infer, that it is good and needs no recommendation, and so be deservedly censured as a conceited scribler.</P>
<P>Should I write a preface and con∣demn the performance, confess it has innumerable faults, and request the reader's pity and patience, I not only prepossess them against it, but acknow∣ledge myself an idiot, for suffering it to meet the public eye, in such an imper∣fect state. What then am I to say, or how fill up those few pages necessary to be placed at the beginning of a book?</P>
<P>Shall I tell the reader my design in publishing these volumes? I will; It was an anxious desire to see all my dear country-women as truly amiable as they are universally acknowledged beautiful; it was a wish to convince
<PB N="iii" REF="027654_0005_0FD56795545B6918"/>
them that true happiness can never be met with in the temple of dissipation and folly, she flies the glare of fashion, and the midnight revel, and dwells on∣ly in the heart conscious of performing its duty, and is the constant compani∣on of those, who, content with the station in which it has pleased Provi∣dence to place them, entirely free from envy or malice, make it their whole study to cultivate those amiable virtues which will render them at once beloved, admired and esteemed, by all who know them.</P>
<P>Whether I have executed this design well or ill, must be hereafter deter∣mined, not only by those partial friends whose kind encouragement prompted me to submit these pages to the inspec∣tion of the public: but, a-well-a-day for me, I must also be judged by some sage critic, who, "with spectacle on nose, and pouch by's side," with
<PB N="iv" REF="027654_0006_0FD567CCC9F8AC60"/>
lengthened visage and contemptuous smile, sits down to review the literary productions of a <HI>woman.</HI> He turns over a few pages, and then
<Q><L>Catching the Author at some that or therefore,</L>
<L>At once condemne her without why or wherefore,</L></Q></P>
<P>Then, alas! what may not be my fate? whose education, as a female, was necessarily circumscribed, whose little knowledge has been simply gleaned from pure nature, and who, on a subject of such importance, write as I feel, with enthusiasm.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty of placing a poem at the beginning of the work, which was published some few years since in the novel Victoria, and as ma∣ny parents utterly forbid their daugh∣ters reading any of that species of writing, I thought I should readily be excused for introducing it here.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="027654_0007_0FD5679703179488"/>
I must confess, I have neither suffi∣cient conceit or fortitude to enable me to hear, unmoved, the decision of <HI>judicious</HI> criticism; yet, conscious that I never wrote a line that would convey a wrong idea to the head, or a corrupt wish to the heart, I sit down satisfied with the purity of my intentions, and leave it to the happy envied class of mortals, who have received a liberal education, to write with that taste and elegance which can only be acquired by a thorough knowledge of the classics.</P>

<HEAD>VERSES, ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY, ON HER LEAVING SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I WISH not, Anna, to offend,</L>
<L>But write the language of a friend;</L>
<L>For tho' my dear from school you're freed,</L>
<L>You've enter'd on a <HI>task</HI> indeed;</L>
<L>To act, as you proceed through life,</L>
<L>As daughter, mother, friend, and wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No doubt, within the school confin'd,</L>
<L>Your charming lively active mind,</L>
<L>By fancy's aid, contriv'd to dress,</L>
<L>Gay painted scenes of happiness;</L>
<L>And thought in all your future hours,</L>
<L>To find your pathway strew'd with flow'rs,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! lovely maid, too soon you'll find</L>
<L>Your happiest days are left behind!</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="027654_0010_0FD567D332B114D0"/>
To grief and sorrow we were born,</L>
<L>Each flow'er we see conceals a thorn;</L>
<L>Like traitors, who, with hidden dart,</L>
<L>First soothe and win, then wound the heart.</L>
<L>Tho' life is an uneven road,</L>
<L>And tho' uncertain our abode,</L>
<L>Within this fragile house of clay,</L>
<L>Yet there are means to smooth the way;</L>
<L>From my experience <HI>dearly</HI> bought,</L>
<L>Blush not, my Anna to be taught.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And first, dear girl, each morn and ev'n</L>
<L>Lift up your spotless soul to heav'n,</L>
<L>The pow'r who gave you life adore,</L>
<L>His wrath appease, his grace implore;</L>
<L>'Tis our first duty; next to this,</L>
<L>Study your earthly parents bliss.</L>
<L>Increase their joys, soothe all their cares,</L>
<L>And have no wish, no will but theirs;</L>
<L>Whate'er they bid you do or say</L>
<L>Dispute not, chearfully obey</L>
<L>Their just commands, and if severe,</L>
<L>Remonstrate only with a tear:</L>
<L>For tho' unkindness grieves the heart,</L>
<L>Submission is a daughter's part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Part of your happiness depends</L>
<L>On a judicious choice of friends.</L>
<L>If e'er your heart's by grief oppress'd,</L>
<L>Repose it in a mother's breast;</L>
<L>To her each secret thought impart,</L>
<L>Use no disguise, detest all arts;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="027654_0011_0FD5679DC38D4D40"/>
Be candid, open and sincere,</L>
<L>A mother's love you cannot fear,</L>
<L>She'll be a kind and faithful friend,</L>
<L>And teach you how each fault to mend,</L>
<L>To others be polite and kind,</L>
<L>But cautious how you speak your mind:</L>
<L>Yet should it be your fate to meet,</L>
<L>A woman prudent and discreet.</L>
<L>Whose tongue to slander ne'er was prone,</L>
<L>Who makes your joys and griefs her own,</L>
<L>Prize her, for 'tis from bounteous heav'n</L>
<L>The choicest gift that can be giv'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In friendship with the other sex</L>
<L>Be cautious, they are apt to vex;</L>
<L>Nor vainly think that you shall prove</L>
<L>The pleasures of Platonic love:</L>
<L>It is a phantom in the way,</L>
<L>To lead poor thoughtless girls astray.</L>
<L>Tho' man by nature was design'd,</L>
<L>A guardian for weak woman kind,</L>
<L>Endow'd with reason, sense and care,</L>
<L>To shield from wrong the helpless fair,</L>
<L>No sooner did the tyrant see</L>
<L>Woman from ev'ry blemish free,</L>
<L>Than heedless of his guardian part,</L>
<L>He strove, by mean seductive art,</L>
<L>To rob her of her brightest charms,</L>
<L>To fill her breast with wild alarms,</L>
<L>Revers'd kind nature's gentle plan,</L>
<L>And woman's now the slave of man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="027654_0012_0FD567D455C2F410"/>
<L>To lovers act with modest spirit,</L>
<L>Treat them according to their merit;</L>
<L>Encourage not, from foolish pride;</L>
<L>Fifty to dangle at your side:</L>
<L>But if you do not like a man,</L>
<L>Dismiss him gently as you can;</L>
<L>Thank him, but say 'twould be in vain,</L>
<L>Ever to urge his suit again.</L>
<L>But if the man whom you approve,</L>
<L>Should softly tell a tale of love;</L>
<L>Let your flush'd cheek and downeast eye</L>
<L>In silence modestly reply;</L>
<L>Yet don't too easily believe,</L>
<L>For man, my Anna, will deceive,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to misfortune's school you're brought,</L>
<L>Sad sorrow's lesson to be taught;</L>
<L>If forc'd from your dear parent's side,</L>
<L>To pass through life without a guide;</L>
<L>Be circumspect, be cautious, then,</L>
<L>Beware of all, but most of men.</L>
<L>For they will study to betray,</L>
<L>And make our helpless sex their prey;</L>
<L>From virtue's bright refulgent throne</L>
<L>With baleful hand will drag you down;</L>
<L>Dishonour first, then leave to mourn</L>
<L>Those blessings which can ne'er return.</L>
<L>As the young bird who from the nest,</L>
<L>Its mother's fost' ring wings and breast</L>
<L>Timidly ventures thro' the air,</L>
<L>Far from the tender parent's care;</L>

If chance some hawk beholds it fly,</L>
<L>He views it with an eager eye,</L>
<L>Pursues, and clench'd within his power,</L>
<L>It falls, poor bird, to rise no more</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When once the nuptial knot is tied,</L>
<L>And my sweet girl becomes a bride,</L>
<L>Be it your care to keep your own</L>
<L>The heart your virgin sweetness won.</L>
<L>Kind to his friends and those he loves,</L>
<L>Be sure to like whom he approves.</L>
<L>Let neatness o'er your dress preside,</L>
<L>Let prudence all your actions guide;</L>
<L>Far from your bosom ever chace</L>
<L>The green-ey'd fiend, and in its place</L>
<L>Encourage mutual confidence;</L>
<L>For jealousy, if not driv'n hence,</L>
<L>Will on your inmost vitals prey,</L>
<L>And steal your soul's repose away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To servants gentlest usage give,</L>
<L>'Tis hard enough that they must live</L>
<L>In servitude, without ill-nature,</L>
<L>From those they serve, a fellow-creature,</L>
<L>Tho' plac'd in e'er such low degree,</L>
<L>Feels grief and pain as well as we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In ev'ry station seek not wealth,</L>
<L>Nor pray for aught save peace and health;</L>
<L>For by mankind it is confess'd</L>
<L>The middle sphere is still the best,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="027654_0014_0FD567D61CC2DAA0"/>
Contentment there her throne will six,</L>
<L>And fly the gilded coach and six.</L>
<L>If e'er your heart feels joy sincere,</L>

<L>To humble merit be a friend,</L>
<L>The character, aspersed, defend.</L>

<L>While Anna thus her time employs,</L>
<L>Pure and unmix'd will be her joys;</L>
<L>Time, thus improv'd, glides gently on,</L>
<L>Nor will you find one day too long.</L>
<L>And when at length the hand of death,</L>
<L>Shall steal away your vital breath,</L>
<L>The ghastly king shall only be,</L>
<L>A messenger of joy to thee,</L>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF MENTORIA.</HEAD>
<P>MENTORIA, or rather Helena Askham, was the only child of a brave soldier, who, though born to move in but an humble sphere, had courage, magnanimity, and fortitude, that might have become a staff officer, but he never rose to higher rankthan a serjeant, in which station he acquitted himself with so much honor that he was universally esteemed by his superiors, and be∣loved by his equals. He was, at an early age, married to the daughter of a reputable tradesman, who preferring the hardships of war, to a separation from her husband, resolutely followed him to every campaign. It was at the frege of Quebec, that our gallant veteran was wounded and left dead on the field: his faithful partner, unable to support the shocking tidings which were abruptly conveyed to her, fell into premature labour, and in giving birth to a female infant, rendered up her own life.</P>
<P>Colonel Dormer was acquainted with the cir∣cumstance, and determined to protect the poor little orphan—ordered it to be provided with a nurse; and when he wrote to England, informed his sis∣ter, Lady Winworth, of the charge he had under∣taken,
<PB N="16" REF="027654_0016_0FD567D81CCEE890"/>
requesting she would permit the little He∣lena to be sent over to be educated with her daugh∣ters. Her ladyship acquiesced, and Helena ar∣rived safe in England, when only two years old, and was immediately admitted into the nursery a∣mong the little Winworths, and as she grew up enjoyed with them the benefit of a polite and liberal education.</P>
<P>The young Lord Winworth, as he advanced towards manhood, could not behold the young orphan without some emotions of tenderness, He∣lena was pleasing in her person, and elegant in her manners, but she was endowed with discernment and sense far superior to the generality of young women of her age. She possessed sensibility enough to be unable to listen with coldness and inatten∣tion to the ardent professions of a young noble∣man, who to the advantages of birth and fortune, added a prepossessing figure, and every polite ac∣complishment—but she knew that he was extreme∣ly young, and that, in all probability, however eager at that time to enter into indissoluble engage∣ments, he would hereafter repent his precipi∣tancy, and regret that he had not matched with one more suitable in rank and fortune. She also reflected that she should, by accepting him, dis∣appoint the hopes of his mother, and prove her∣self ungrateful to a woman who had ever treated; her with maternal tenderness, "And shall I,"
<PB N="17" REF="027654_0017_0FD567A30EB22178"/>
said she, <Q>for the gratification of a passion which has perhaps arose from childish fondness, and only gains strength by not being opposed, entail on myself the anger of my best benefac∣tors, and lay myself open to the sneers of the world, by matching so far above my expecta∣tions, nay, will not my husband be laughed at for raising a poor orphan to his rank and title. I am determined to stifle this rising passion, and to inform my Lady of the unfortunate at∣tachment of her son.</Q></P>
<P>This judicious resolution she immediately put in execution. Lady Winworth listened to her with a mixture of surprise and admiration. "My dear Helena," said she, "you shall never want a friend while I exist. This generous conduct has rendered you more amiable than ever. My son is but a boy, I will send him abroad, and in all human probability a few years spent at some of the gayest Courts in Europe, will entirely era∣dicate this youthful <HI>penchant."</HI></P>
<P>When the young gentleman was informed of his mother's desire that he should travel, he flew to Helena, and earnestly entreated her to consent to a private marriage before his departure. She laughed at his importunity, though her little heart was ready to rebel, and she sound to laugh (how∣ever repugnant to her feelings) was the only way
<PB N="18" REF="027654_0018_0FD567D98AF505F0"/>
to avoid an affecting interview. Her mirth piqued him, "You do not love me, Helena," said he. "I never told you I did, my Lord." "But your looks, your actions, have contributed to make me think you did." "Why, my good Lord," said she smiling, "I do love you most affectionately, and wish for nothing more than to see you happy." "Then why not consent to our immediate union?" cried he eagerly." Because I love you as a bro∣ther, and hope to see you, when you return, married to some lady of birth, merit, and for∣tune, and to figure as bride-maid on the occa∣sion." "Unaccountable girl," said he, peevish∣ly, "then only promise me to remain single till my return." "Indeed I shall not, my Lord, for I have no intention to wear a willow garland; and sure I am, that should I make such a promise, we should both repent it before the year was out." "Nay, Madam," said he, angrily, "if you are of so light a disposition—" "It is even so," cried she, with affected vivacity, "therefore, as you are warned, pray beware, and think no more of so trifling and inconstant a character."</P>
<P>When Helena retired to her own apartment, she gave free vent to her feelings; and in order to avoid the pain of parting, requested permission of Lady Winworth, to pay a visit to a young lady, who lived some miles from town. The old Lady saw the propriety of her request, and immediately
<PB N="19" REF="027654_0019_0FD567A52DA98B70"/>
granted it. She therefore departed the next morn∣ing, leaving only a card, wishing his lordship health and much pleasure in the course of his tra∣vels. So striking a proof of her indifference in∣creased his resentment, and he left England with∣out any of those pangs which he imagined he should suffer when separated form his Helena.</P>
<P>The event proved that Helena was right; for when Lord Winworth returned, he brought with him a bride, lovely, amiable, and his equal in rank and fortune. When his lordship left Eng∣land, he took with him a young gentleman, as a travelling companion; this gentleman did not see Helena previous to his departure, but at his return, charmed with her innocent vivacity and judicious conduct, requested permission to pay his addresses; which was immediately granted, and on their union he was presented with a post under govern∣ment, which he enjoyed till his death.</P>
<P>Helena being then left in rather straitened cir∣cumstances, was requested to become governess to the daughters of Lord Winworth; she consented, on condition that they might be permitted to retire with her into the country. His lordship purchased a estate in Wales, and thither she retired with her young charge.</P>
<P>On the death of his wife, Lord Winworth re∣quested
<PB N="20" REF="027654_0020_0FD567DB17A75FC8"/>
her to bring his girls to town, and become their conductor in public, as she had been their preceptress in private: but this she resolutely re∣fused.</P>
<P>On the separation of the young ladies from their kind, almost materna. end, they requested a continued correspondence might be kept up be∣tween them. Mentoria was the appellation they had ever given her, and under this name was the correspondence commenced.</P>
<P>As her letters are interspersed with entertain∣ing tales apposite to the subjects on which she wrote, I have avoided giving any of the young ladies' letters, as they would only prove an in∣terruption to the general design.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I. MENTORIA, TO THE MISS WINWORTHS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER being accustomed to the society of my dear Miss Winworths for fifteen years, how solitary and comfortless is my situation. I every day feel my loss more severely. I look at the harpsichord, and expect my Sophia to come and practise her favorite lessons. I take up a book, and almost unknown to myself, call on Emily to read some passage that pleases or inter∣ests
<PB N="21" REF="027654_0021_0FD567A68D2B3358"/>
me. I miss the dear lively sallies of Ger∣trude, and the innocent prattle of Letitia: but though I so severely feel the privation of your beloved society, I am not so selfish as to wish you again in the shades of Cambray. I am certain of the necessity of your taking a part in the active scenes of life, and as your dear mother is now no more, your father will necessarily require the cheerfulness of his children to brighten his soli∣tary hours, and it was but just that my beloved girls should appear in the station they were born to ornament.</P>
<P>I highly comment the prudence of your fa∣ther, in taking Mrs. Clairville into his family, to be your <HI>chaperons</HI> on your first entrance into fashionable circles. She is a woman who has seen a great deal of polite life, has ever retained an unblemished reputation, and though reduced by misfortune to be glad to accept the situation your father offered her, has ever been received as a guest whose presence conferred an obligation, by some of the first families in England.</P>
<P>Though separated from you, I shall, as you desire, still continue your preceptress, and shall not at any time scruple to tell you of your faults; for partial as I am to your virtues, I am by no means blind to those errors to which human na∣ture is ever subject, and which, if not timely era∣dicated,
<PB N="22" REF="027654_0022_0FD567DC8A2EA4C8"/>
will gain an ascendancy over your mind, and entirely hide those amiable qualities, which at present form the most striking traits in your character.</P>
<P>And to begin—I feel myself greatly hurt and offended by the letter I received from Gertrude, since your arrival in London. When it was first delivered into my hands, a joyful sensation dif∣fused itself over my heart, and while reading the tender expressions of grateful affection that seemed to flow spontaneous from your pen, it expanded with pleasure; but when I came to these words, "My father received us with great affection, and has been very bountiful in presents, cloaths, pocket-money, &amp;c. but yet for all that, my dear Madam, I cannot feel that perfect affection for him, which I know I ought. He has a great ma∣ny peculiarities, some of them by no means plea∣sing; and my sisters all agree, he is very much of the Bashaw."</P>
<P>Good Heavens! said I, and is this all the fruit I am likely to reap from the pains I have taken to instil into the minds of those dear girls a just idea of what is meant by the words, Filial Duty. That the very first letter I receive should point at the little foibles of a parent, who they ac∣knowledge received them with affection, and has been extremely bountiful to them. Believe me,
<PB N="23" REF="027654_0023_0FD567AE2C978318"/>
my dear children, if you wish to pass through life with any degree of pleasure to yourselves, you must early learn to submit, without murmur∣ing, to the will of your father; be blind to his errors, or if they are so glaring that you can∣not avoid seeing them, never expose them, or suffer others to speak disrespectfully of him in your presence.</P>
<P>You must sacrifice your own wishes to his, you must study his happiness and ease, and in so doing will most assuredly promote your own.</P>
<P>You no doubt remember the amiable Mrs. Railton, who favored me with her company for a few weeks last summer. I yesterday received news of her death, and as I am certain example is ever more efficacious than precept, I will give you a slight sketch of her history, as a model by which every young woman who wishes to pro∣mote her own felicity, will regulate her con∣duct.</P>
<P>Mr. George Campbell was the youngest son of a wealthy baronet, who having several livings in his gift, besides good interest at Court, brought him up to the church, with the sanguine expecta∣tion of one day seeing him a bishop.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="027654_0024_0FD567E0D655F0F8"/>
Unfortunately for George, before he had at∣tained his twenty-third year he became attached to a young lady, who had every requisite to render the married state happy, but money—and money being the old gentleman's darling idol, he consequently thought she possessed no requisite worthy the wife of his son; but George was too far engaged to retreat with honor, he therefore told his father, he was resolved upon the union, and in a few days presented his be∣loved Louisa to entreat his blessing.</P>
<P>When Sir James found they were really mar∣ried, he thought it was in vain to fly in a passion, he received them cordially, and gave them, an universal invitation to his house, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings were dis∣posed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his estates to his eldest son.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year came round, his wife presented him with a child. Poverty took up her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of disobe∣dience, not only brought on himself his father's displeasure, but involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a scene of penury and distress. These reflections sour'd his disposition, he became peevish and morose, nay sometimes went so far, as
<PB N="25" REF="027654_0025_0FD567A8C9EE2510"/>
to reproach his wife as the cause of his abject situ∣ation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Campbell took great care to instil into the minds of her children the respect and affec∣tion due from them to their father. "My dear children," she would often say, "be assured, a breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret, and in general with misfortune."</P>
<P>Louisa was the eldest of five children, she was mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively listened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her heart as an inestimable treasure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew so extremely bad, that not only his wife, but his children came in for a share of his ill-humour. Louisa, in parti∣cular, was sure to be wrong, in whatever she said or did, and it was seldom she was favoured with a kind or affectionate word, yet her manners were so amiable and her form so lovely, that though she laboured under the disadvantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was courted by some of the genteelest families in the village, but in compliance with her father's ill∣humour, she was seldom allowed to stir from home.</P>
<P>When Louisa had reached her seventeenth year, Lady Mary Campbell, a distant relation of her
<PB N="26" REF="027654_0026_0FD567E28E2425D0"/>
father's came on a visit to a family who resided in the same village, Louisa's good qualities were resounded to Lady Mary from every mouth, and all unanimously agreed it was a pity so lovely a girl should be buried in obscurity and lost for want of a proper education.</P>
<P>Lady Mary was naturally of a humane disposi∣tion, she expressed a desire to see Miss Campbell, and when introduced to her, finding her even su∣perior to what she had been taught to expect, made her an offer of going with her to London.</P>
<P>This was a proposal, too much to Louisa's ad∣vantage to be refused; the invitation was accepted, and the visit prolonged for three years, during which time Louisa had an opportunity of im∣proving herself in the ornamental as well as use∣ful branches of education.</P>
<P>Mrs. Campbell, who had for many years la∣boured under an evident decline, was now sum∣moned home by that power, who had been pleased in this life to try her with long and heavy afflic∣tions. Lady Mary carried Louisa to receive the dying blessing, and pay the last duties to her ami∣able mother.—That finished, she proposed her return to London. The lovely girl, penetrated with gratitude for the many favours she had re∣ceived and tenderly attached to her generous be∣nefactress,
<PB N="27" REF="027654_0027_0FD567AD46D84220"/>
with difficulty restrained her tears, while she thus addressed her—</P>
<P>"Think me not ungrateful, dear Madam, if I beg to remain with any father; my brothers and sisters are engaged in learning occupations which may enable them to pass through life with in∣dustry and without reproach. I cannot leave my father in this solitude after so recent an afflic∣tion: he has been for many years used to the un∣remitting attention and tenderness of my excellent mother, I must not suffer him too severely to feel her loss, but endeavour, as far as in my power, by affection and assiduity, to supply her place."</P>
<P>"And can you, my dear Louisa, said her La∣dyship, so easily forego the ease and plenty you have enjoyed with me, to live a life of penury and labour, and that for a man, who, though he is your father, I must say, does not deserve such at∣tention—did he not always treat you with unme∣rited harshness?"</P>
<P>"Hold, my dear Madam," said Louisa, if, as you think, my father has not behaved to me with the kindness of a parent, it by on means re∣leases me from my duty to him; had he a thou∣sand errors he is my father still; as such I am called upon by nature and religion to do every
<PB N="28" REF="027654_0028_0FD567E4CAF12D90"/>
thing in my power to render his life comfortable; if my endeavours to please can awaken his affec∣tion, I shall think myself amply repaid; if not, the consciousness, of having performed my duty, will give me a satisfaction which no future event can ever rob me of."</P>
<P>It was in vain Lady Mary urged her to return—the lovely. elegant, accomplished Louisa, pre∣ferred a low roofed mansion, scanty meals, and attendance on a sick peevish father, to the lofty apartments, plenteous table, and variety of amuse∣ments, she might have enjoyed with Lady Mary. She attended him to the last, and by her tender so∣licitude and affection smoothed the down-hill of his life, and cheared and comforted him in the most painful illness by her unaffected piety; he was moved by her filial duty, all the father rushed up∣on his soul, he blessed her with his parting breath, and expired in her arms.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, enquire, what benefit Lou∣isa reaped from this rigid performance of her duty? The question is easily answered. She gained a contented happy mind, serenity dwelt in her heart and chearfulness beamed from her eyes.</P>
<P>She had a genteel competency left her at Lady Mary's death, married a deserving man, and
<PB N="29" REF="027654_0029_0FD567AFA7717150"/>
shone as conspicuously in the characters of a wife and mother, as she had done as a daughter—she lived beloved by all and died universally re∣gretted.</P>
<P>Be wise, my dear children, follow Louisa's ex∣ample, so shall your lives be happy and your last moments peace.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I AM sorry, my dear ladies to be under the dis∣agreeable necessity of again taking up my pen to reprove,</P>
<P>Your letters to me of late, have arrived so sel∣dom, and when they do arrive, are so short, so filled with dress, visits, and parties of pleasure, that I almost doubt whether some demon has not imitated your hand-writing, to impose upon me; for I can find no vestige of those sentiments I so anxiously strove to inculcate in your minds while in the shades of Cambray: from the tenor of your letters, I should imagine you live entirely in a crowd, if so, you certainly have no time to at∣tend to those improvements I so strongly recom∣mended to you not to neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="027654_0030_0FD567E722174798"/>
You seem also to have taken an unaccountable dislike to Mrs. Clairville. You say your father is a great deal too partial to her; this appears to me the evident effect of envy or jealousy; your father being perfectly sensible of that lady's merit, and conscious that her situation in his family is rather humiliating, by treating her with uncom∣mon respect, shews the goodness of his heart, and sets an example which I should rejoice to find my dear girls would follow.</P>
<P>Another thing which seriously alarms me for your future happiness is, to find you have your friends and secrets, and form little cotteries, of which neither your father nor Mrs. Clairville have any knowledge; believe me, you cannot be too cautious in the choice of your intimates, many a girl, whose intentions have been perfectly inno∣cent, has lost her reputation, by associating with women whose levity has rendered their characters suspicious. You cannot find in the whole circle of your acquaintance, a friend so sincere as your natural parent, to him you may without reserve, communicate every wish of your hearts, for trust me when I say, every thought you would hesitate to reveal to a parent, must be totally improper to be harboured in your bosom. Perhaps you will tell me, that having no mother, there are some emo∣tions of the heart, which the natural timidity and delicacy of your sex would render it extremely painful to communicate to a father.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027654_0031_0FD567B457311E58"/>
As I am sensible of the truth of this assertion, I must recommend to you to chose a friend from among those most esteemed by your father, let her be some years older than yourself, (for age, in ge∣neral, learn experience in the arts of the world) and by her advice, she may, in some measure guard you from falling a prey to the dissimulation of many pretendens to love or friendship, who will assume the semblance of attachment, to draw the unsuspecting youthful heart into improper con∣nections, which too often terminate in their ruin.</P>
<P>A numerous acquaintance is, in general, of dangerous consequence to young women, as it is impossible but in a multiplicity of characters there may be some, whose conversation and example it would be improper to follow, and such is the frail state of human nature, that bad habits are easily contracted, and can seldom if ever be eradicated. A girl just entering the state of womanhood es∣pecially if she is possessed of any personal or men∣tal accomplishments, and of an open ingenuous temper is surrounded with innumerable dangers; her reputation is of as delicate a texture, and may be as easily injured, as the fairest blossom; the malignant whisperings of envy, or the pestiferous breath of slander, may in an instant blast it; it will droop under the keen eye of suspicion, and too often those who most pretend to admire its sweets, will rudely pluck it from its parent stalk,
<PB N="32" REF="027654_0032_0FD524451591D9C0"/>
deprive it of all its beauties, then throw it from them like a loathsome weed, leave it to perish unpitied and unregarded, and to be trod to the earth by every unfeeling passenger, who may perhaps cast on it a look of contempt, and cry, "Behold the once lovely."</P>
<P>There are many women in the world lovely in their persons, elegant and engaging in their manners, who are yet very improper connections for girls, who wish to preserve their reputation unsullied; of this description I greatly fear your favorite Matilda is—the strong dislike she ex∣presses at the idea of your bringing either your father or Mrs. Clairville to see her, convinces me there must'be something in her character which she would not like to have discovered. Remem∣ber it was at a public ball you first formed an acquaintance with her; that a gentleman intro∣duced her to you, and chance afterwards led you in a morning excursion to ride by her little <HI>chateau;</HI> you confess she lives in an elegant man∣ner, that she is highly accomplished, and yet is always by herself. Would any woman of cha∣racter and fortune, do you think, live thus re∣cluse, have no female friends to associate with, no little chearful parties to enliven her solitude, and when she went into public, would she go only accompanied by gentlemen? You say there is an air of mystery about her; and, believe me, if
<PB N="33" REF="027654_0033_0FD567B58B01EEA0"/>
that mystery was developed, it would discover nothing to her advantage. Let me intreat my dear girls to drop the acquaintance, or inform your father of it: if after a proper enquiry con∣cerning her character, he should approve the con∣tinuation of your visits, I shall be happy to find you have so agreeable a member added to your society, and severely blame myself for having judged so harshly.</P>
<P>I should not have so many fears concerning your intimacy with Matilda, had I not, some years ago, known a very amiable girl, who entirely forfeited her good name, and in the end her life, by associating with a woman of light cha∣racter.</P>
<P>Harriet Harding had the misfortune to lose her mother when very young, and at a very early age took upon herself the choice of her own acquaint∣ance. She had been at the play one night, when a lady in the same box had shewn her many civi∣lities, and at parting gave her a card, and begged to have the honour of seeing her.</P>
<P>Mr. Harding had remarked what passed, and on returning home, warned his daughter against forming any acquaintance with her, as she was a woman publicly kept by a man of fashion.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="027654_0034_0FD567E9AD8EF6C0"/>
Harriet was giddy, thoughtless and fond of pleasure; chance threw her again in the way of Amelia, and she entirely forgot her fa∣ther's injunction. A strict intimacy ensued, she was frequent in her visits to Amelia, often went with her into public, and was charmed with the incense of flattery that was offered to her by the men. Mr. Harding had business which called him to a distant part of England, Harriet was left mistress of her own actions, and chose this op∣portunity to go with Amelia on an excursion in the country; in this excursion they were attended by the gentleman who kept Amelia, and one of his friends, who was particular in his attentions to Harriet; the time flew on the wings of plea∣sure, and when they returned to town, (Mr. Harding being still absent) it was proposed she should accompany the party to a masquerade.</P>
<P>Harriet was a stranger to this sort of amusement, her spirits were exhilerated—she did not think of leaving it till a late hour, and when she mentioned going home Amelia was not to be found. The gentleman who had been her protector all the evening, begged permission to see her home, she consented, and at the hour of five in the morn∣ing arrived at her father's house; a servant who had arose carly to perform some particular work let her in, and the gentleman followed her up stairs. She was surprised, but could not he so
<PB N="35" REF="027654_0035_0FD567B74A8730C0"/>
rude as to tell him to leave the house; but how was her surprise increased, when throwing aside his mask and domino, he proceeded to take li∣berties she had ever been used to think of with abhorrence. Unable to defend herself from his insults, she shrieked aloud, and in a moment her father, who had returned the evening before, burst into the room—her shame and terror over∣came her, and she fainted; an explanation en∣sued between the father and the gentleman who had insulted her, who shocked at the impropriety of his behaviour asked Mr. Harding's pardon, and staying till Harriet was recovered, gave her this advice at parting.</P>
<P>"I trust, my dear young lady, this will be a warning to you in future, how you choose your intimates. Amelia is a woman so publicly known, that it was next to impossible for you not to have been acquainted with the lightness of her charac∣ter, I am now fully convinced that you are a wo∣man of strict honour, but, believe me, till this day I always thought you a girl who had either no reputation to lose, or paid very little attention to so material a concern. I am sorry to say there are numbers of persons, of both sexes, who have seen you with Amelia, who think the same, and whom it will be a very difficult matter to convince to the contrary; let me beg of you to break off a connection so derogatory to your honor, and
<PB N="36" REF="027654_0036_0FD567EADAABBA70"/>
by the future propriety of your conduct regain that reputation, which your intimacy with so in∣famous woman has considerably injured."</P>
<P>Harriet could answer only with her tears, which flowed plenteously, not only at hearing these dis∣agreeable truths, but from the reflection, that when the stranger was gone she had still her fa∣ther's anger to endure; had this been all, Harriet might have thought herself happy, as by her fu∣ture behaviour she might have hoped to regain his confidence and favour, but the heedless girl too soon found, that not only her father watched her actions with a suspicious eye, but all her female friends received her visits with coldness, forbore to return them, and in a short time entirely dropped her acquaintance; to add to her morti∣fication, a young gentleman who had for some time addressed her on an honourable score, broke off the connection, and she found herself as so∣litary and as much neglected as though she lived in a desert."</P>
<P>"The consequence was, that on her father's decease, which happened soon after, finding her∣self, without society, she renewed her intimacy with Amelia, and from being accustomed to an intimate acquaintance with vice in others, she sunk so low as to practise; it herself, without compunction or remorse; till overtaken by dis∣ease
<PB N="37" REF="027654_0037_0FD567BAD4F5A578"/>
and want (the sure attendants on riot and intemperance) she sunk to an early grave, a victim to her own folly."</P>
<P>You see, my dear girls, Harriet was not natu∣rally of a depraved inclination, she shrunk with horror from the first approach of vice; her attach∣ment to Amelia was founded on a love of plea∣sure, she enjoyed every luxury while with her, led a life of indolence, and was continually re∣ceiving presents of something to decorate her per∣son; these were indulgences she could not enjoy at home, for though Mr. Harding was a very substantial tradesman, he would by no means al∣low his daughter to launch into extravagance, ei∣ther in her housekeeping, dress, or pleasure—he wished to see every hour usefully employed, and as youth in general are much more found of plea∣sure than employment, Harriet was delighted with the acquaintance of a woman in whose so∣ciety she could enjoy the one in its utmost extent, without ever hearing of the other.</P>
<P>I know my dear girls will tell me, there is no danger of Matilda drawing them into any im∣proper scenes, by gratifying their desire of dissi∣pation, since their father indulgently allows them to enjoy every pleasurable amusement the metro∣polis affords. But you are totally unacquainted with the world, there are a thousand ways by which
<PB N="38" REF="027654_0038_0FD567ED2FF32580"/>
an artful woman may steal upon the undesigning heart, a thousand ways by which she may lead them to destruction. Be wise then, my sweet young friends, and drop this acquaintance, before you feel any of its disagreeable consequences.</P>
<P>I shall in some future letter give you a few hints concerning the proper use of time, certain that however harsh you may for a moment think my reproofs, the native goodness of your hearts, will convince you they are meant solely for your good, and that you have not a more affectionate friend than</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. MENTORIA TO MISS WINWORTHS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Girls,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last I gave you a striking instance of the dangerous tendency of improper acquaintance; be assured, there are more women led into errors by the bad precepts and examples of their own sex, than you would be apt to imagine, not only in forfeiting their good name, but every preten∣sion to happiness. I do not know how otherwise
<PB N="39" REF="027654_0039_0FD567BC5B184398"/>
to account for so many lovely, amiable women entailing misery upon themselves and their poste∣rity, than by the romantic ideas they entertain of love and friendship.</P>
<P>Love, my dear children, is a noble, generous passion, and when kept under the guidance of rea∣son, exalts and elevates the human soul; but the juvenile mind is apt to mistake a transient like∣ing, or a sudden impulse of gratified vanity, for love; and many a girl from at first being pleased with the company of those who indiscriminately offer the incense of adulation to every young fe∣male begins to fancy one more particular than the rest, and that one is undoubtedly designed to be her husband. From the moment this idea takes place, Miss is most violently in love, sleeping or waking the dear youth is continnally in her thoughts, she lives but in his presence, when he is absent she only exists. She unbosoms herself to some dear girl nearly of her own age, and she being her friend and confidant, the secret is to be kept inviolable. For want of some laudable pursuit to employ her time and engage her attention, she indulges her foolish <HI>penchant,</HI> which originated first in vanity and was afterwards nursed by fancy, till at length she is in reality attached to a man, who perhaps never entertained a serious thought of her; he marries some other woman, and Miss is left to sigh at her hard late, com∣plain
<PB N="40" REF="027654_0040_0FD567EE9389B580"/>
of the perfidy of mankind, and indulge in a luxury of delicate ideal misery. Nor is this all, her dear and faithful friend betrays her se∣cret to all the Misses of her acquaintance, who (though perhaps guilty of the same folly them∣selves) will not scruple to laugh at what they will term, her indiscreet and foolish conduct.</P>
<P>Though such a situation is certainly sufficiently mortifying, yet it is by no means the worst that may happen. A girl who imagines she must be in love with the first man who says a few civil things to her, lays herself open to the designs of the object of her ideal passion, who if he should happen to be an artful man, may take advantage of her partiality and credulity, to draw her into indissoluble engagements, which is in general the case when there is a fortune in the way, or where that charm is wanting, to plunge her into infamy.</P>
<P>I once knew a girl, who, possessed of every advantage which could be derived from wealth, beauty, honorable relations, and a polite liberal education, at the early age of eighteen fell a victim to a romantic passion, and in the very mo∣ment when she sacrificed the regard of her friends the hopes of future advancement in life, in short, every thing that was valuable, she fancied she had done a praise-worthy action, by evincing her
<PB N="41" REF="027654_0041_0FD567BE0C18D510"/>
constancy and disinterested attachment to the ob∣ject of her first love.</P>
<P>Belinda Dormer went to the same school with me, we contracted a great friendship for each other, and when the holidays separated us, by calling each to her respective home, we trea∣sured up every little incident in our memories, whether of pain or pleasure, that when we met we might exchange confidence, and live over our pleasures, or soothe the remembrance of our lit∣tle uneasinesses by participation.</P>
<P>Bell was a lovely brown girl, elegant in her form, accomplished in her manners, and lively in her disposition; her heart was tender and af∣fectionate, without the least tincture of art or affectation, good-natured, easy, and credulous. She left school at the age of seventeen, and was ushered into the world, prepared to admire her, for she was reputed heiress to an immense for∣tune. The Christmas before she was taken home, during the holidays, her father gave a hall in honor of her birth-day, a young officer, whose only recommendation was an handsome person and polite address, and who depended on Mr. Dormer for father advancement in the army, requested the honor of her hand, and in the course of the evening danced himself so far in∣to her esteem, that she implicitly believed him,
<PB N="42" REF="027654_0042_0FD567F0129FEDD8"/>
when he told her she was the loveliest creature in the world, and that he should be miserable if she did not suffer him to hope he was not altoge∣ther indifferent to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Dormer had placed great confidence in this young man, he had taken him from a state of abject penury, placed him at a genteel academy, and when he imagined him capable of discharg∣ing his duty, as became a man of honor and a soldier, purchased him an ensign's commission in a regiment going to America, where he raised himself to the rank of captain, and was now just returned to England. Mr. Dormer ever intend∣ed to be the friend and patron of young Horton, but never dreamt of his aspiring to his daughter, he therefore gave him a general invitation to his house, nor once thought but that his gratitude and honor would be sufficient to prevent his forming any improper designs on the person or fortune of Belinda, besides he was near ten years older than Miss Dormer, and therefore there was no fear of an attachment taking place between them.</P>
<P>But Horton was an artful ambitious man, he long had wished to enjoy the benefits of an in∣dependent fortune, and looked on Belinda as the person by whose assistance he could obtain so desirable an acquisition. He had always been
<PB N="43" REF="027654_0043_0FD567BF4AEFD5D0"/>
successful with the ladies, but the true state of his finances being generally known, he found it impossible to succeed in any matrimonial scheme, except it was with the innocent and unsuspicious, and Belinda was exactly suited for his purpose. He flattered, swore, knelt, wept, and acted every extravagance, till the simple girl made some confessions in his favor, he then prevailed on her to keep her partiality a secret from her mo∣ther, for he knew that her parents designed her for the bride of a young nobleman, who was at at that time abroad. He expatiated on the folly and cruelty of parents choosing partners for their children, and launched out in praise of disin∣terested love, talked of the union of souls, and a deal of soft sentimental nonsense, about a life of uninterruped felicity with the object of her own choice, though she was to live in the meanest cottage.</P>
<P>When Belinda returned to school, she fancied herself as much in love as it was possible for any sentimental heroine to be, and declared, for her sweet Horton she would be coutent to relinquish all the elegancies and indulgencies to which she had ever been a customed, and live upon the coarsest viands, in an obscure mansion. It was in vain I endeavoured to argue my young friend out of these ridiculous notions, she remained
<PB N="44" REF="027654_0044_0FD567F189A803F0"/>
fixed in her determination, to marry Horton or not marry at all.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Belinda, at that time I had as chimerical ideas of friendship as she had of love, and should have supposed it an inexcusa∣ble breach of confidence, to discover her de∣signs to her mother, though it would have been the best proof of real friendship I could possi∣bly have given her.</P>
<P>She was taken from school with a design of being introduced to Lord Gaymore; she went home one day, had a meeting with Hor∣ton the next, and the third morning by five o'clock set off in a chaise and four to Scotland, without having even seen the person her parents so earnestly wished her to be united with.</P>
<P>When they returned, Mr. Dormer, though highly offended at the rash conduct of Belinda, and the black ingratitude of Horton, forgave them, and settled an handsome annuity on her, but told them the bulk of his fortune was en∣tailed on Lord Gaymore, (who was the nearest male relation) in case of her refusal of him.</P>
<P>Belinda was soon settled, and I took an early opportunity to visit her; I sound her, according to her own words, "superlatively happy! Her
<PB N="45" REF="027654_0045_0FD567C241CF64E8"/>
Horton was the kindest best of husbands, her home was a paradise, she would not be Lady Gaymore for the world! What was affluence? Nothing when put in competition with love and Horton." But this was the language of ro∣mance.</P>
<P>I called on her again in about six months. I found her fitting in extreme dishabille, her face was pale, her eyes sunk, and as she pensively leaned her head upon her hand a tear now and then stole down her cheek. I asked tenderly the cause of her sorrow. "Oh! my friend," said she, "I have undone myself! Horton is no longer the attentive tender husband." I, smiling, told her, that she must not expect the solicitude of the lover to last for life, but be content with the more calm and lasting esteem of a friend.</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied Belinda, "I have no friend, I find, too late, my violent attachment to Hor∣ton was the romantic whim of a lively imagina∣tion; and that the union of souls, the similarity of sentiment, which I had vainly thought would make the fetters of Hymen easy, and even delight∣ful, existed only in my ideas. Horton has nei∣ther sense, good nature, or politeness at home, though he appears to possess those amiable quali∣ties so eminently abroad. He is extravagant, vain, and too fond of his own person, to be long
<PB N="46" REF="027654_0046_0FD567F4A3D54378"/>
attached to any woman, except his passion is excited by interested motives; he has not scru∣pled to own, it was the hope of possessing my for∣tune alone induced him to address me, and that had he known the estate was entailed on Lord Gaymore, he never would have troubled himself to make love to a puny, baby-faced girl, when there were so many fine women who would have thought themselves honoured by his notice. In∣deed, continued she, redoubling her tears, he seldom comes home but I am insulted with a re∣cital of the many women of fashion who make him advances, and I am debarred of every inno∣cent amusement, stinted in my dress, and almost kept without pocket-money, that he may appear with elegance in company, and have plenty of money to la vish in expensive pleasures.</P>
<P>I was greatly chagrined to find my dear young friend had really such just cause for complaint, but endeavoured to comfort her, and lead her to hope, that by constant affection, attention, and good-humour, she might recal her wanderer, and awaken in his bosom reciprocal tenderness. But I found by her reply, these were fallacious hopes.</P>
<P>She had been to visit her parents, and had there formed an acquaintance with Lord Gay∣more, Unfortunately the ill-fated Belinda dis∣covered
<PB N="47" REF="027654_0047_0FD567C30FA09C40"/>
this once dreaded nobleman to be pos∣sessed of every real virtue, of which Horton had assumed the semblance; his person was hand∣some, without being effeminate, his heart glowed with humanity and benevolence; he was a man of refined sense and strict honor, with a mind enlightened and expanded by a liberal education and a thorough knowledge of the world. Belinda saw him, and acknowledged the full value of the happiness she had voluntarily cast from her.</P>
<P>I warned her against making comparisons to the disparagement of her husband; and hinted the folly and danger of suffering any other per∣son to stand higher in her esteem. She acknow∣ledged the truth of my remarks, said she would en∣deavour to be patient and content, but she greatly feared she had lost sight of happiness for ever. And so indeed it proved, for though at the death of her father she received a very handsome legacy, so great was Horton's extravagance, that it was presently gone, lavished away on the worst of wo∣men for the most infamous purposes.</P>
<P>Belinda had children very fast, and before she was thirty years old was left a widow with eight helpless children, to struggle with the accumulated evils of poverty, contempt, and a broken heart—Horton's extravagance having obliged her to sell her annuity, she had no resource but to accept a
<PB N="48" REF="027654_0048_0FD567F777450470"/>
small yearly allowance from Lord Gaymore, who was then married, and allowed her a hundred pounds a year, for the education of her eldest boy, to whom he was god-father.</P>
<P>I will leave you my dear girls to imagine the pain and mortification of such a dependence, and while you pity Belinda's misfortune, cautiously avoid her errors! I shall renew the subject next post, till when and ever believe the your friend,</P>

<PB N="49" REF="027654_0049_0FD567C48E164ED8"/>
in a clandestine manner, or encourage addresses which she has any reason to think her parents or friends would disapprove; such a conduct is gene∣rally attended with disagreeable consequences.</P>
<P>I have a collection of letters in my possession, which I think might well be termed a school for lovers, and will, I am certain, be of more ef∣fect in convincing you of the impropriety of clan∣destine marriages, than a whole sheet of dull precepts. I have sent them for your perusal, and by way of preface, shall give you an account of the means by which I became possessed of them.</P>
<P>A favourite servant of your grand-mother a who had been my nurse, had married a reputable tradesman, but, through unavoidable misfortunes, they were reduced, and the husband thrown into prison. Martha lived in an obscure lodging, and had been for some months extremely ill. My lady encouraged me in going to see her, and car∣rying her little presents.</P>
<P>One day my lady was gone out to dinner, the servants were all in the kitchen, and I took that opportunity of going out unobserved to visit Mar∣tha. Charmed with the idea of going by myself (for I usually had a servant with me) I tripped nimbly along, in my way laying out my whole stock of pocket money, which amounted to five
<PB N="50" REF="027654_0050_0FD567F84E0BE6C8"/>
shillings, in tea, sugar and biscuits, for my nurse. As I went up stairs to Martha's apartment, I ob∣served in a small back room, the door of which was taken off the hinges, a tall well-made man, in an old rusty black coat, his face pale and meagre, his arms folded upon his bosom, his eyes fixed seemingly on the floor, but instead of the vacant inanimate stare, there was a mixture of hor∣nor and despair depicted in them. Curiosity prompted me to draw near the door of the room; at the farther and, on a bundle of straw, the only furniture the wretched apartment afforded, sat a woman, whose features told she had once been lovely; on her lap lay an infant asleep, beside her sat a fine boy, who, with a piteous accent was asking for bread; the woman paid no attention to his entreaties, but with her eyes fixed on the youngest child, appeared like misery personified. Young as I was, I felt my heart greatly afflicted at this scene, and running hastily up stairs into Martha's room, unable to articulate a word, I burst into tears. Martha astonished at the agony I was in, tenderly inquired the cause. I told her what I had seen. "Alas! my dear child," said she, "those people are in more distress than it is possible for you to conceive; they have lodged in this house about six weeks, in which time I am certain they have had nothing to support them∣selves and children but what they could raise from the sale of a few cloaths; they are now a fortnight
<PB N="51" REF="027654_0051_0FD567FAB769EDA8"/>
in arrears for rent, and the inhuman landlord has taken the door off the hinges, and the windows out of the frames, to oblige them to quit the apart∣ment. Alas, poor souls, they have no means of procuring another shelter from nocturnal dews, when they relinguish this. I have not seen him stir out these two days past, and am apt to think in that time they have had no food except a slice of bread and meat which I gave the eldest child yesterday.</P>
<P>How at that moment did I regret my money be∣ing all spent, five shillings appeared to me a for∣tune, which might preserve these unfortunate peo∣ple; however, I had not even a single halfpenny, nor could I bear the thought of taking from Mar∣tha any part of what I had given her. I there∣fore hastily bade her good bye, and flew rather than walked home, inquired for the house-keeper, related the afflicting situation of the family, and requested the loan of half a guinea. The house∣keeper was an unfeeling, mercenary woman, she never heard a tale of distress but she imagined it fictitious, nor would she ever bestow any relief, lest the object relieved should be an impostor. She refused my request. I then had recourse to the nursery maid, but could borrow no more than one shilling.</P>
<P>With this trifle I eagerly returned to the poor
<PB N="52" REF="027654_0052_0FD567FD408E41F8"/>
sufferers, entered the apartment, and under pre∣tence of kissing the infant, dropped the shilling into the mother's lap. The exclamation which broke from her, when she saw the money, con∣vinced me she was a foreigner; and the demeanour of the man was vastly above the common rank of people.</P>
<P>Unfortunately my Lady did not return from her visit till after supper, so that I was not permit∣ted to set up to see her; but though I retired to bed I could not sleep, my mind had been too much agitated, and the starving family had left such an impression on it, that the moment I closed my eyes they were present to my imagination. Early in the morning I stole to Lady Winworth's chamber, told my little story, and on my knees intreated some money to carry to them.</P>
<P>Her Ladyship, though from infancy nursed in the lap of ease and affluence, had an heart over∣flowing with compassion towards her suffering fel∣low-creatures; she gave me two guineas, and or∣dered the footman immediately to attend me.</P>
<P>I cannot describe the joy that expanded my heart as I proceeded to G— Street. The master of the house was just risen, and was open∣ing his shop. I asked for the foreign gentleman. <HI>Gentleman,</HI> returned he with a sneer, the French
<PB N="53" REF="027654_0053_0FD567FF94343208"/>
beggar I suppose you mean, I don't know where he is, I turned them out last night; people who cannot afford to pay for their lodgings, must lay where and how they can. Cruel inhuman wretch, said I, and turned from him with every mark of abhorrence.</P>
<P>It was yet early, the morning was inviting, and I thought a walk in the fields might cheer me after my recent disappointment; however, I previously determined every inquiry should be made after the poor foreigner and his family.</P>
<P>Crossing a field in the vicinity of Mary-le∣bon, the voice of a child crying caught my ear, I turned my head, and saw at a little distance, seated on a log of wood, the very person I had been seeking, one child was in his arms, the other stood by him, his wife lay on the ground. I ran to him, spoke to him, bade him take hope, and put the two guineas in his hand—he looked at the money, then at me. Angel of mercy, said he, with a deep sigh, it is too late, my Agnes has left me. I saw his intellects were disordered and shuddered with horror. Thinking the wife would be better able to take care of the money, I stooped in order to awaken her—I called her, she moved not—I took hold of her hand, it was dreadfully cold; she is in a sit, said I, and raised her head upon my knee, Never, oh! never,
<PB N="54" REF="027654_0054_0FD568008E3E29F8"/>
my beloved girls, will the spectacle that presented itself to my eyes, be banished from my memory. Her eyes were partly closed, her mouth half open, her lips black—Death had that night re∣leased her from a world of misery. I shrieked and fainted. When I recovered I found myself in my dear Lady's arms, who told me, the body of the poor young woman was taken care of, that the man was quite distracted and entirely un∣able to give any account of himself, though from an unfinished letter, addressed to the Marchioness Savillion, which was found in the woman's pocket they had reason to suppose they were of a good family.</P>
<P>The man survived his wife but a few days, my Lady took care of the children.</P>
<P>About six months after I was sent to a convent near Paris, in order to finish my education, and perfect myself in the French language. Among a number of boarders who resided at the convent, I was particularly noticed by one, who was dis∣tinguished by the title of St. Augustina; she was of a weakly constitution, and often confined to her bed, when she was always pleased if I would work or read beside her. One day she gave me her keys, and desired me to unlock a cabinet and take out a curious piece of needle∣work which she said had been executed by a once
<PB N="55" REF="027654_0055_0FD568042866E540"/>
loved friend. As I took the work from the drawer, a miniature picture attracted my notice; methought I knew the features; I took it up to examine it more minutely, and immediately re∣collected the interesting countenance of the un∣fortunate Agnes. Upon inquiry I found I was right in my conjecture; St. Augustina was the Marchioness Savillion, whom Lady Winworth had made numerous fruitless inquiries after. She had been the friend and companion of Agnes, but had married and left the convent where they both boarded just before that young lady, and her last pathetic letters never reached her till it was too late to administer relief; the Marchio∣ness had since lost her husband and two fine children, by fire, which accident had so impaired her health and depressed her spirits, that she had retired from the world, and meant to spend the remainder of her days in the convent where she had passed her youth. She shewed me all Ag∣nes's letters, and before I left France suffered me to take copies of them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. AGNES TO THE MARCHIONESS.</HEAD>
<P>WHY have you left me, my Augustina, why are you away at the moment I most want your advice?—Selfish Agnes, methinks I hear
<PB N="56" REF="027654_0056_0FD56805CD4314A0"/>
you say, to regret the happiness of your friend, because it interferes with your own. Oh! no, I do not regret your felicity, my sweet friend, I rejoice, I exult in the reflection that you are for ever exempt from the pangs which at present rive the heart of the wretched Agnes.</P>
<P>You ever knew the aversion and horror that seized my heart when I reflected on the intended union between myself and the Count de la Rue. Alas! my Augustina, the time approaches when that aversion will become a crime, and yet I feel it every day increase. Shall I own to the sympathizing bosom of friendship, that my heart has made its election, and that election has not fallen on the man for whom my parents have de∣signed me. I know you will blame me, I know you will bid me endeavour to conquer my grow∣ing passion, and call in reason to my assistance. Alas! what power has reason over the heart torn by contending passions? Duty bids me stifle my sighs, and bend my thoughts and wishes to∣wards the Count, love triumphs over duty, and I can only think of Vieurville.</P>
<P>The day after you left our convent, Madamoi∣selle Vieurville requested me to attend her to the parlour, where her brother and lover waited to see her. "You must go, Agnes, said she, or my brother will be quite at a loss how to amuse
<PB N="57" REF="027654_0057_0FD5680A1C4B83D8"/>
himself, while I converse with Montrose." I was easily persuaded, and on entering the parlour, was struck with the noble mein and elegant man∣ner of young Vieurville; we chatted for some time on indifferent subjects, his vivacity and wit, (through which it was easy to discover a fund of good sense) delighted me, and when I retired with Mademoiselle, I could not help expressing my ad∣miration; he is a charming young man indeed, said she, and had I not known that you were on the point of marriage, I should not have ventured to introduce him to you, for fear you might lose your heart; for you must know (continued she, paying no regard to the visible emotion which I am certain agitated my features) that Louis is to be married the same day that I am, to a beautiful Spanish lady, who is expected in Paris next month. Has he ever seen his intended bride? said I, affecting indifference. Oh! no, she re∣plied, but if Donna Clara be but half as lovely as her picture represents her, he must inevitably fall in love. It is odd, said I, that he should consent to marry a woman he has never seen. I dare say it appears so to you, replied Mademoiselle, but when I shall tell you how it came about, your wonder will cease.</P>
<P>My mother was the only daughter of an ancient wealthy Spanish family, and eloped with my fa∣ther
<PB N="58" REF="027654_0058_0FD5680B2F4B3D20"/>
from a convent, where she was placed for education. The match was very unequal; her father was irreconcilably offended, and would never suffer her to be named in his presence.</P>
<P>My mother was tenderly beloved by her bro∣ther, who, at the old nobleman's decease, paid her a handsome fortune, and vowed their families should ever live in the strictest amity.</P>
<P>My uncle was married to a woman of whom he was passionately fond, and when, in giving birth to Donna Clara, she departed this world, he took a solemn oath that no other woman should ever supply her place, but that the whole of his future life should be devoted to the care of his daughter. My mother at that time lying in of a son, the two infants were contracted to each other, and my brother, at his uncle's decease, is to inherit the estate and titles devolving to him from his grand∣father. My uncle is expected to bring his daugh∣ter to Paris this winter, when the marriage is to be completed, and I shall be delivered from this horrid convent.</P>
<P>I cannot describe my feelings during Mademoi∣selle's recital. I know not what could be the cause of my agitation, but I could hardly restrain my tears, while I remained in her apartment. When I retired, I began to take my heart to task,
<PB N="59" REF="027654_0059_0FD5680CE1B14650"/>
and determined to repel a rising passion, which had thus suddenly taken possession of it: I fore∣bore making any comparison between my intend∣ed Lord and young Vieurville, and determined never to see the latter again; but the next morn∣ing vanquished these good resolutions.</P>
<P>I was but just arisen, when one of the lay-sisters informed me a gentleman requested a few mo∣ments conversation. Imagining it to be either the Count, or some messenger from my father, I repaired without hesitation to the parlour. Judge of my surprise when I found myself in the presence of Monsieur Vieurville. Supposing the nun had made a mistake in calling mé instead of Made∣moiselle, his sister, I was going to retire, when he intreated me to stop, assured me there was no mistake, and taking my hand, led me to a chair, and seated himself beside me.</P>
<P>I come, dearest Madam, said he, to entreat a few moments serious attention from you, and a candid answer to a question, which though abrupt in its nature, yet from the circumstances which we both at present are in, demands an ex∣plicit reply. My sister has informed me, that your parents design you for the wife of Count de la Rue; however presumptuous the supposition may be, I cannot imagine your heart has any in∣terest in the intended union. My heart, Sir,
<PB N="60" REF="027654_0060_0FD5680E0D1D6430"/>
replied I, will ever follow the dictates of duty, and rejoice in ratifying any engagement which I am certain will give my parents so much plea∣sure.</P>
<P>But was that heart left to make its free choice, would it then have selected the Count as the ob∣ject of its dearest affection?</P>
<P>I know not, Monsieur, what authority you have to make these enquiries, nor do I think myself obliged to answer them.</P>
<P>I rose to quit the parlour—lovely Agnes, said he, catching my hand, I know I have been a∣brupt, but let my situation plead my excuse. You no doubt have heard from my sister, that I am designed the husband of a woman I have never seen; till yesterday I ever believed my heart un∣susceptible of the power of beauty, and imagined I might be as happy with Donna Clara as any other woman, but I am now convinced, that indif∣ference only proceeded from the want of a proper object to call forth the affections of my heart. I have seen the lovely object who has that power, I feel my bosom glow with new and unutterable sen∣sations, and though I would have married Clara had I continued in a state of indifference; I will never wed her now, my heart is firmly attached to another. You, adorable Agnes, are the only
<PB N="61" REF="027654_0061_0FD5681202655B88"/>
woman who ever gave my heart a single pain, or taught it to throb with rapture; if your affections are already engaged, I will condemn myself to eternal silence, but if you will grant me one ray of hope that you are not altogether indifferent to my suit, the world shall not tempt me to enter into any engagement with Donna Clara.</P>
<P>Oh! my beloved Augustina, at that moment reason, honour, fortitude, forsook me, enchanted with the convincing proof he offered to give me of inviolable attachment, I suffered him to per∣ceive my partiality. I thought not on the irrepar∣able injury I should do Vieurville's family, I for∣got the duty I owed my parents, the respect I owed myself, and confessed that he alone was the master of my affections.</P>
<P>I see your anger, my dear friend, I hear you blame my imprudence; shall I lose your friend∣ship, Augustina, will you chase the imprudent Agnes from your bosom! Alas! If you do, where will she find another resting place? The thought overpowers me, I can write no more.</P>

<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE your reproof, I see my error, but I have not power to renounce it. You bid me exert my fortitude; I have no forti∣tude, my friend, it all forsook me when I was parted from Augustina, what little I ever possessed was but a gentle spark of virtue caught from her bosom. I am nothing of myself, a feather, an atom of thistledown is heavy when weighed a∣gainst the stability of Agnes. Donna Clara is ar∣rived, and Vieurville has refused to fulfil the engagements his father had entered into; his sister suspects the cause, I have lost her friendship, I have endured her reproaches; yes, my friend Agnes de Romani has subjected herself to re∣proach, and conscious that she deserved it, re∣ceived it in passive silence, nor dared to vent her full heart in aught but tears. Oh! Augusti∣na, how am I fallen! I have this morning received a summons to return home; to-mor∣row I leave the convent, to-morrow I bid adieu to Vieurville. I am expected to receive the hand of the Count—'tis a vain hope, I am deter∣mined to refuse him—I cannot be the wife of Vieurville, I will never be the wife of another—my grave would be a welcomer bridal bed, than

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>EIGHT months of my novitiate is past, and I have never heard of Vieurville. But what is Vieurville to me? Am I not going to re∣nounce the world and all its pleasures; am I not going to devote my future life to my maker? Augustina, are not my thoughts free, and though my body is immured within the walls of a cloister, may not my fancy wander, free as air, to Vieurville. Oh! the tortures of suspence! Could I but know where he was, could I but be satisfied he still remembers Agnes, methinks I could be content. Write to me, my friend, en∣deavour to calm my mind; tell me, Augustina, when I have thrown off the trappings which mark a child of vanity, will not sweet peace in∣habit my bosom, when simplicity has attired my person? And when the irrevocable vow has past my lips, will not my perturbed spirits be hushed to rest, and all my soul be rapt in religious har∣mony. Oh! no, no, my sweet friend, the massy doors that close on us poor captives, cannot shut out the busy meddling passions, or stifle the feel∣ings we receive from nature. The simplicity of our habit is not an index of the purity of our mind, nor is the kneeling posture, or lifted eye, true indications of the fervor of religion! Au∣gustina,
<PB N="65" REF="027654_0065_0FD5681BF0B85DC8"/>
hypocrisy may dwell in a convent, so may love, hatred, jealousy, and despair. And is an heart agitated by these contending passions, a sit sacrifice to be offered at the throne of grace? Will not your Agnes be the worst of hypocrites, to vow eternal love and faith to her Maker, when her whole soul is absorbed in a passion for a frail mortal!</P>
<P>I know I distress you, my friend, Oh! par∣don the wretched Agnes, if with her complain∣ing she sometimes dashes with bitter the cup which overflows with blessings; if you refuse to hear my complaints, where shall the unhappy Agnes seek for compassion—hadst thou never left me I should not have been the wretch I am.</P>

<P>AUGUSTINA, you will tremble when you receive this, you will think it a meritori∣ous act to drive from your heart the remembrance of Agnes de Romani; but if thou hast any re∣maining gleam of compassion in thy gentle bosom,
<PB N="66" REF="027654_0066_0FD5681DE68FDF38"/>
oh give it way, renounce not thy unhappy friend, but chear her with one forgiving line.</P>
<P>I have seen Vieurville, I have forfeited my vows, left the convent, and become a fugitive and an exile, my brain is distracted when I think what I have suffered this last fourteen days, nor can all my husband's tenderness soothe me. My pulse throbs, my veins are scorched with heat—I must throw aside my pen, my eyes are dim. Augustina, thy dying friend lifts up her soul in prayers for thy happiness.</P>
<P>After three weeks being confined to my bed, I am at length permitted to address the com∣passionate friend of my youth. Raised from the confines of the grave, I once more pour forth my soul into the bosom of Augustina. I will now at∣tempt to give you some regular account of the proceedings of last month. Alas! my friend, my heart will bleed afresh as I trace the painful scenes, painful they will ever be to my remem∣brance, for I have drawn inevitable ruin on the man my soul doated on.</P>
<P>As I had never heard any tidings of Vieur∣ville, from the time I was taken from the convent, with a design of being married to the Count, till within three days of the time when my novitiate was expired, I began to look on my profession as
<PB N="67" REF="027654_0067_0FD5681F66F534A0"/>
inevitable, and endeavoured to bring myself to think of it with calmness, but still corroding thoughts would sometimes intrude, and overturn my best resolutions. My only wish was to hear whether Vieurville was alive or dead, or whe∣ther he was married to my rival; but these were particulars I was never able to discover, as his father and family had quitted Paris soon after my return to the convent.</P>
<P>There remained but three days now before I was to take the veil, and I endeavoured to fortify my mind against the awful day, with every argu∣ment reason or religion could supply. I was busy in reflecting on the change a few short hours would make, when one of our boarders asked me to accompany her to the grate; I complied, and we amused ourselves sometime in chatting to two English ladies, who were in the parlour; the ladies were just preparing to leave the convent, when a violent ringing at the gate alarmed us; the portress ran to open it, and in a moment Vieurville rushed into the parlour. I know not what I said or whether I spoke at all—a sudden mist obscured my sight and I fell to the ground; when I recovered, my friend, the boarder, told me, that seeing the impetuosity of my lover, she had advised him to leave the convent, and if he had any thing particular to communicate, to do it by letter, and inclose it to her. Her friendly
<PB N="68" REF="027654_0068_0FD568210F030868"/>
soothing greatly contributed to calm my spirits, and as none of the sisterhood had seen Vieurville, they all remained ignorant of the interview.</P>
<P>In about three hours I received a letter, in which he told me, nothing but absolute force should so long have kept him from me; that he had been detained in Spain by various stratagems, but having at last eluded the vigilance of his guards, he hurried to Paris, where he presently learnt the sacrifice I was about to make, he urged my leaving the convent and being united to him by the most indissoluble bonds; and said, he made no doubt but my father would be easily led to forgive us. I shewed the letter to my young friend, she joined the persuasions of Vieur∣ville, and said she would undertake to manage my escape on the very morning on which I was to become profest.</P>
<P>I wrote to my dear Vieurville, and my friend enclosed it in one from herself, directing him in what manner to proceed. That very evening Edella, (which was the name of my friend) was seized with a violent indisposition, which would have made a dupe of even me, had I not been in the secret. She continued ill all night, and the next day when she desired the abbess to send to a relation she had about seven miles from Paris, re∣questing she would send her coach for her the
<PB N="69" REF="027654_0069_0FD56823AB67A220"/>
ensuing morning at eleven o'clock, as she thought a few days spent in the country, would be of in∣finite service to her. Vieurville was ordered to send a carriage at nine, and it being the last morn∣ing of my novitiate, I desired not be disturbed till it was time for me to enter the chapel. This re∣quest I knew would be complied with, as it would be supposed, I wished for time for meditati∣on. Accordingly I early left my cell, and go∣ing to Edella's apartment, dressed myself in some of her cloaths, and put on a long black hood which would pull over the face; thus attired, I waited anxiously for a ring at the gate and guessing it was the coach, hurried down stairs, and so prevented the portress from coming up to call Edella. I met several of the nuns as I passed from her apartment to the door, but they neither spoke to me, nor attempted to stop me. I got out of the convent unsuspected, and in less than an hour was in a place of safety, where a priest immedi∣ately united me to my dear Vieurville. My first desire was that we should fly to my father for his protection, intreat his pardon and blessing, and through his intercession be again received into the church, from whence I was certain we should be excommunicated. It was midnight when I arriv∣ed at my father's, he had been returned from Pa∣ris near four hours, whither he had rapaired to see me take the veil, and was then, overcome with fatigue and disappointment, just retired to
<PB N="70" REF="027654_0070_0FD5682842D21B60"/>
rest. I would not permit the servant to inform his master that I was come home, but following him up stairs, threw myself on my knees by his bed-side. He started at seeing me, fury flashed from his eyes, and grasping my hand with vio∣lence, he cried, Agnes, ungrateful girl, why are you here? With tremulous accents, I in a few words told him I was married, and intreated his pardon and friendship.</P>
<P>Oh! never shall I forget his answer, twas aw∣ful, 'twas more than nature could support. He spurned me from him, he cursed me, and impre∣cated the wrath of heaven on his head if ever he forgave me. "I will not, said he, precipitate your impending fate, by betraying you to the ecclesiastical powers; go hasten to leave France, and if you can be happy oppressed by the weight of a father's curse, may you be so!—Hence, begone, you offend my sight."</P>
<P>Vieurville forced me out of the room. During the time of my petitioning for pardon, my mother had arose, she followed me down stairs, blessed me, and promised to use her interest with my fa∣ther, to effect a reconciliation. She gave me all the cash she possessed and some jewels that had been presented me by a relation. When I em∣braced her for the last time, it seemed like rend∣ing soul and body asunder; but hope, that sweet
<PB N="71" REF="027654_0071_0FD56829115C7540"/>
soother of the human mind, bore me up, and I flattered myself we should one day meet again.</P>
<P>When we left my father's house, we set for∣ward immediately for Calais, and from thence embarked for Dover, where, overcome by agita∣tion and fatigue, I was seized with a sever which brought me to the verge of the grave. During my illness Vieurville wrote to his father, and we now anxiously await the arrival of an answer. Oh! may it be propitious, but my sad heart presages I shall never more know happiness: For myself, I could have borne it patiently, but when I think I have involved my dear Vieurville in mise∣ry, my brain sickens and almost madness ensues.</P>

<P>WHEN will my portion of misery be full, when shall I say there is 'no more to suf∣fer. When I am laid in the silent grave, when my eyes close on this world and open to immor∣tality, then Augustina may say, Agnes is at peace!</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="027654_0072_0FD5682BC1F4C738"/>
Though I have not received a line from your once friendly hand, I still think you have not forgotten me, and having no other prop where∣on to lean, I still pour forth my sorrows to you. My mother, my only friend, is torn from me, and I have the additional misery of thinking my disobedience precipitated her end; she drooped from the day I left France, and her confidential servant informed me, her last breath was spent in intreating my father to pardon me, but he was inexorable.</P>
<P>Vieurville has received an answer from his father; but, oh! my Augustina, what killing lines did it contain. Donna Clara had conceived a passion for her cousin, and from the time of his leaving Spain, fell into a profound melancholy, and when she heard of his marriage, the agitati∣on of her spirits became too much for her weak frame to support, and a rapid decline carried her an early victim to the grave. Vieurville is disinherited, disowned, and loaded with a fa∣ther's anger; but will you believe it, my friend, he still loves the woman who has brought those misfortunes upon him; but that love, that warm mutual affection that subsists between us serves only to heighten our misery—for oh! what tor∣ture can compare to that of seeing the object we love overwhelmed with distress we have not the power to mitigate?—</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="027654_0073_0FD5682F0E9F7C08"/>
I am a mother, Augustina, but far from feel∣ing transport when clasping my infant to my heart, methinks his innocent eyes reproach me with bringing him into the world, when his only birth-right is wretchedness. Poverty, with hag∣gard countenance, and famine, with cold grip∣ing hand, have taken up their abode in our dwell∣ing. Must I write it, must the daughter of de Romani tell her friend, she is in want of al∣most the common necessaries of life!—Oh! bitter reflection, hard, hard task, Agnes must so∣licit charity of her friend Augustina!—And, alas! my friend, unless relief comes soon, we must perish! for in this strange land what can we do? We cannot work, and (notwithstand∣ing the known humanity of the British nation) we are ashamed to beg.</P>
<P>Oh! how blind are the dictates of passion! how erroneous are its judgments! may none of my sex henceforth listen to its delusive argu∣ments, but by adhering to the precepts of reason, avoid the miseries of.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IF ever this reaches the hand of my ever∣loved Augustina Savillion, enquire for my children, and be to them a mother; intreat the Marquis to take them under his protection, for a few short days will render them orphans. We have passed from one degree of wretchedness to another, till a bundle of straw, a dry crust, and a few rags that cover our emaciated frames, are the whole of our worldly possessions, and to en∣crease my affliction, six weeks since I brought into the world another child of sorrow.</P>
<P>Gracious heaven! could words convey to my Augustina the extent of my misery, could she but for a moment, even in idea, experience my sufferings;—but may the beneficent power that rules the world avert from her even the shadow of such afflictions, may my bitterest enemy ne∣ver experience the pangs that at present harrow up my soul.</P>
<P>I am a mother, I hear the darling of my heart, the child of my bosom asking for food, and have it not to give him. I am a wife, and see my adored, my almost idolized husband, sinking under the complicated evils of famine,
<PB N="75" REF="027654_0075_0FD56834551C8A80"/>
grief and sickness, yet have neither comfort or consolations to offer. Let the wife, the mother, judge of my tortures, they are agonies that may be felt, but cannot be described.</P>
<P>Augustina, this is the last time I shall ever address you; this night the wretched Agnes must lay her head upon the earth, with no ca∣nopy but the skies. Oh! my children, Oh! my beloved Vieurville, thy mother, thy wife has murdered thee.</P>
<P>Adieu. If thou hast any children, tell them my story, and teach them to subdue their passi∣ons. We are incompetent judges of what will promote our own happiness. Oh! that I had never—</P>
<P>Here the unfortunate Agnes breaks off, this was the letter found in her pocket, and in all probability was written the day before her death.</P>
<P>To attempt a comment on this story would be an insult to your snderstandings; I shall there∣fore leave you to make your own reflections, and wishing you every happiness, throw aside my pen. Adieu, I need not tell you how much I am your friend,</P>

<HEAD>MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART I.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"She sets like stars that fall to rise no more."</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE sun was sunk beneath the western hills, his parting beams made the horizon flame with burnished gold, and darted on the topmost branches of the lofty trees of a neighbouring so∣rest. Autumn had not put off her pleasing robe, nor had the gentle zephyr forsook the plain to give place to his rude brother Boreas. The ground was strewed with leaves of various hues, the ripened fruit hung on the bending trees, and fields of waving golden grain render∣ed the scene delightful.</P>
<P>Marian and Lydia having finished their daily task, set aside their wheels with alacrity, and tying on their straw bonnets, prepared to enjoy the beauties of the evening, by rambling over the adjacent fields and meadows.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="027654_0077_0FD568380D7CAEB8"/>
They were innocent and sprightly as the young fawn that lightly bounds over the verdant lawn; smiling youth and rosy health glowed upon their cheeks, and sparkled in their eyes; their wishes untaught by art or luxury to stray beyond the bounds which simple nature has marked out, were easily supplied; they arose each morn with the feathered choristers, and chearfully pursued their daily labour; the even∣ing was their time for mirth. Innocence pre∣sided over all their pleasures, and meek-eyed content on downy pinions hovered over their homely couch, sweetening their quiet slum∣bers.</P>
<P>Their cottage was situated in a pleasant val∣ley, on the borders of Wales; it was plain and rural, it contained every necessary, but no super∣fluities; simplicity had decorated it, and the neatness of its furniture rendered it more pleas∣ing to▪ the rustic inhabitants than the most sump∣tuous palace.</P>
<P>Here Marian and Lydia, by their chearfulness and industry, enlivened the declining hours of their mother Dorcas.</P>
<P>Beware, said the careful mother, beware, my children, tarry not too long, lest the evening damps should impair your health, and rob your mother of her only comforts.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="027654_0078_0FD56839994B5B68"/>
The sisters departed, and as they wandered over the fields, in the innocent gaiety of their hearts, carroled forth their songs in wild, untu∣tored, but melodious notes.</P>
<P>Sir George Lovemore had arrived a few days before at Gwinfred-Hall, to visit a maiden aunt, whose unlimited fortune demanded this mark of respect, for the virtues of her mind, or the sweetness of her manner he was totally unac∣quainted with. Mrs. Gwinfred's unaffected pie∣ty, good-humour, and amiable disposition, were things totally disregarded by the young liber∣tine, though the visit was professedly made to her, yet he spent but a small share of his time in her company. He was continually rambling from one place to another, making visits to those neighbouring gentlemen whose opinions and manners most suited with his own. He was this evening returning from a visit to the Earl of Landaff, he was seated in an elegant phaeton, drawn by four beautiful bays, his ser∣vants were in their best travelling liveries, which were green faced with buff, and superbly trim∣med with gold lace, they proceeded slowly, the animals seeming to partake of their master's in∣dolence.</P>
<P>Marian and Lydia had wandered to the road, and were just crossing it with an intent to enter
<PB N="79" REF="027654_0079_0FD5683EFB91C568"/>
a small wood on the other side, when this mag∣nificent equipage impeded their way. They had never before seen any thing half so grand—they stopped involuntarily to admire it as it passed; the wind had blown off Marian's bon∣net, her luxuriant brown hair falling in ring∣lets over her face and neck, served as a shade to heighten but not obscure her charms.</P>
<P>Sir George caught a glimpse of her person, and in her little white jacket, simple, unadorn∣ed, she appeared to him like a wood nymph; her form was delicate, her stature rather below the middling size. He alighted from his phae∣ton, and offering his hand to Marian, said he would assist her in crossing the road; he seized her unreluctant hand, he gazed earnestly upon her face, and felt in a moment his heart was captivated by this rustic fascinating beauty; the modest inobtrusive charms of Lydia were unno∣ticed, he called her sister by a thousand divine appellations, which, as they had never heard them before, at once excited their wonder and their fears.</P>
<P>Leave us, good Sir, said Lydia, for we must return home, and should our mother see you, she would be angry with us; besides, Sir, we country maidens are not used to converse with such grand folks, and mayhap you will laugh
<PB N="80" REF="027654_0080_0FD568404E4B12A8"/>
at our simplicity. They then dropped their curtsies, and wishing him a good night, would have left him, but he stopped Marian, and at∣tempted rudely to salute her; she shrieked, struggled, and at length freeing herself from his hold, caught her sister's hand, and darting across the field, they were presently out of sight.</P>
<P>Sir George gazed after them for a moment, then, ascending his carriage, determined in his own mind to attempt the seduction of Marian. He made no doubt but she would again walk the same way, and resolved every night to ram∣ble out in hopes of meeting her.</P>
<P>The sisters slackened not their pace till they arrived within sight of their mother's cottage. Dorcas, uneasy at their long stay, had walked forth to meet them; their haste and confusion alarmed her. Tell me, my children, said she, why are you thus agitated? Has any thing frightened you, or has any of the low-bred clowns insulted you? Why would you walk so late?</P>
<P>Dear mother, cried Lydia, a gentleman stop∣ped us, and was so rude to my sister.</P>
<P>Not very rude, said Marian, interrupting her, he only wanted to kiss me, and I ran away from him. But you cannot think what a fine gen∣tleman
<PB N="81" REF="027654_0081_0FD56841C996B258"/>
he was, so handsome, and he had such a pretty thing to ride in; dear, dear, how I should like to ride in such an one.</P>
<P>I am surprised, Marian, said Dorcas, grave∣ly, to hear you talk thus; it becomes not a girl of your humble station to speak in such rap∣tures of the beauty of a gentleman, or the grandeur of his equipage, much less to form wishes to be indulged by riding in it.</P>
<P>Why surely, dear mother, said she, it is no harm to wish.</P>
<P>It is wrong, my dear child (replied the ten∣der mother) very wrong to form wishes which we are certain, from the situation in which it has pleased Providence to place us, can never be laudably gratified. You know, Marian, 'tis impossible you can ever possess a splendid equi∣page.</P>
<P>Oh! dear, said Marian, I do not think so; mayhap the fine gentleman may be in love with me; I am sure he called me by many pretty names.</P>
<P>Dorcas shook her head, and sighed. And how, said she, looking mournfully at Marian, how has vanity found entrance in a heart I had hoped was the seat of innocence and content.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="027654_0082_0FD56845800E34B8"/>
Don't be angry with my sister, dear mother, said Lydia, to be sure the gentleman did talk a great deal about beauty and goddesses, but I dare say he meant nothing.</P>
<P>That's nothing but envy, said Marian, peev∣ishly, because he did not say any thing to you. For of what use would it be to him to say I was the loveliest girl he ever saw, if he did not think so; that would be fibbing for fibbing's sake.</P>
<P>Dorcas smiled at her simplicity, while she re∣gretted that those sparks of vanity which had ever lain dormant, had by flattery been blown into a flame. They entered the cottage, and sat down to a rural supper of milk and fruit; during the repast Marian could think nor speak of aught beside the gentleman.</P>
<P>Lydia was silent, and Dorcas now and then sighed profoundly, while a tear fell as she re∣verted in her thoughts to occurrences long since past; when they had finished their temperate meal, she thus addressed her daughters.</P>
<P>My dear children, said she, you have often heard me say, that you lost your father when you were quite infants: in that I told you truth; he is lost, irreparably lost to you and me, but it was not death that tore him from us. I
<PB N="83" REF="027654_0083_0FD5684651D619E0"/>
have ever avoided mentioning any of the occur∣rences of my past life, lest it should pain your gentle affectionate hearts, but I find now the hour is arrived when the mother's sorrows shall serve as a warning to the daughters, to teach them to avoid those shoals and quicksands on which were wrecked her happiness and peace.</P>
<P>Listen attentively, and while you weep over my misfortunes, let the errors which brought them on me sink deep in your hearts; remem∣ber they were the cause of your mother's ruin, and shun them through the course of your own lives as you would any poisonous or obnoxious reptile.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF DORCAS. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS the only daughter of a farmer in the West of England. He in his youth, by in∣tegrity and fidelity, so well recommended him∣self to the favour of the nobleman, of whom at that time he rented a farm, that he made him steward of all his estates, which were situated in that country.</P>
<P>I had the misfortune to lose my mother before I had seen sixteen years; she was a woman of ex∣emplary piety, she had early inculcated in my mind a love of religion and virtue, and taught me that humility, charity, and chearful content were the true marks of Christianity.—Had I never suffered those excellent precepts to depart from my mind, I should never have experienced the many miseries which have since marked my un∣happy life.</P>
<P>During the life of this worthy parent I lived ex∣tremely retired, she superintended my education,
<PB N="85" REF="027654_0085_0FD5684BD1FD3980"/>
which was such as might render me a useful mem∣ber of society, but she bestowed very little time on the shewy accomplishments which are set so high a price on in the present age, and which, though they are certainly necessary to finish the education of a gentlewoman, are very immaterial to those who expect to move but in the middle sphere.</P>
<P>After my mother's decease I took the entire charge of my father's family upon me, did the honours of his table, received and entertained all his visitants, and made frequent excursions abroad; I was thoughtless, vain, and giddy. I never be∣fore heard the voice of adulation, which now assailed my ears from almost every man with whom I conversed. I listened to it eagerly, and like my simple Marian placed an implicit faith in all they said.</P>
<P>My heart was full of sensibility, and being deprived of my mother, whom I had ever con∣sidered and loved as a friend, I began to look round for some female object on whom to settle those affectionate feelings, to whom I might un∣bosom all my little inquietudes, consult and ad∣vise with on trifling embarassments and vexations, which at that time I considered as serious troubles.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="027654_0086_0FD5684EC357F118"/>
Unfortunately for me, the Earl of S—to whom my father was steward, at that time came into the country, and brought with him his daugh∣ter, Lady Laura S—and a young gentleman whom I shall call Melfont, he was the second son of a noble family, and though then only nineteen years old, had obtained the rank of captain in the army; his fortune was large, having inherited his mother's jointure, but he had chosen the pro∣fession of arms, as he thought the character of a good soldier increased the dignity of the gentle∣man.</P>
<P>Lady Laura was nearly of my own age, chance one evening threw me in her way, as I was walk∣ing with my father, and though fortune had placed so great a distance between us, she pro∣fessed a friendship for me, which highly gratified my vanity and delighted my father, as he thought it would contribute to my future advancement in life.—But alas! my children, it was the source from whence I might trace all my misfortunes.</P>
<P>Lady Laura was lovely in her person, and gentle in her manners, she possessed a susceptible heart, and I thought her the pattern of all female perfection; but in this I was woefully deceived. She had that selfish principle inherent in her na∣ture, which made her prefer her own happiness
<PB N="87" REF="027654_0087_0FD56850154A8408"/>
to that of the hole world beside; however, this was an error which I did not discover till she had brought inevitable ruin on me, and unfeelingly triumphed in the misery she had occasioned.</P>
<P>From the evening of our first interview she con∣tinually formed pretences to call at my father's, and at length, by the Earl's permission invited me to pass a few weeks with her at Seymour Castle. My father joyfully consented to my ac∣cepting the proffered honour, and the day being appointed, Lady Laura herself came in the cha∣riot to fetch me.</P>
<P>It was near dinner time when I arrived, I felt myself rather abashed on being presented to the Earl, and conscious of my inferiority, my face glowed with confusion. Lord S—was a vene∣rable and truly worthy nobleman; he said many obliging things to me, which in some measure encouraged me, and I began to look and speak with a tolerable degree of freedom, when being informed that dinner was served, the Earl led me into the dining room and presented me to Cap∣tain Melfont.</P>
<P>All my confusion now returned. I blushed, trembled, and hardly knew how I behaved dur∣ing dinner, I had never before conversed with a man so well-bred, polite, and agreeable as Cap∣tain
<PB N="88" REF="027654_0088_0FD524407990D4E8"/>
Melfont. I wished to appear engaging, and conscious of my own insignificance, shrunk as it were into nothing, and a thousand times wished myself at home again. All day I was uneasy and dissatisfied with myself, every accomplish∣ment Lady Laura displayed, made me regret not possessing the same, that I might equally with her contribute to the amusement and share the ap∣plause of Melfont.</P>
<P>In the course of a few days my constraint gra∣dually decreased, the polite freedom with which I was treated by Lady Laura, and the pointed attentions I experienced from Melfont, contri∣buted to raise me in my own esteem, and I became chearful and happy.</P>
<P>As I had ever been accustomed to early rising, I was in general up some hours sooner than Lady Laura, and usually spent the time till breakfast in the garden, sometimes with a book, and some∣times with my work. Melfont had frequently joined me in these little morning excursions, and I believe it was the pleasure I experienced in his company, which made me so often repeat them. At first he was polite, unconstrained and chearful, but he soon grew thoughtful, pensive, and even absent. I saw the change with re∣gret; I almost unknown to myself shared his un∣easiness,
<PB N="89" REF="027654_0089_0FD56857CB327480"/>
and whenever he sighed involuntarily, echoed his sighs responsively.</P>
<P>At length I assumed courage to enquire the cause of his melancholy; he hesitated for a few moments, and then in faultering accents decla∣red himself my lover, at the same time saying, he had not the least hope of ever being happy, conjured me to forget him, pressed my hand to his lips, and left me with precipitation.</P>
<P>I now discovered the state of my own heart, I felt the greatest satisfaction in the knowledge of being beloved; but my affliction was great when I reflected he had said an insurmountable barrier was placed between us. I was weak enough to shed tears, and could hardly summon composure enough to attend Lady Laura, at the usual hour of breakfast—though I was consci∣ous that the indulging an hopeless passion would entail lasting misery upon me, I never once at∣tempted to subdue it, or stifle emotions which my own reason told me were improper and impru∣dent in a young person in my humble station; though I am certain, had I when I first discover∣ed my growing partiality for Melfont, immedi∣ately left Seymour Castle, returned home, and by entering with avidity into all my usual avocati∣ons, strove to banish him from my mind, and cautiously avoided all opportunities of seeing or
<PB N="90" REF="027654_0090_0FD568592E56C718"/>
conversing with him, I should soon have conquer∣ed the predeliction, and regained my usual tran∣quility, but I wanted resolution to fly the socie∣ty of a man whose presence I fancied constituted my chief happiness.</P>
<P>Solitude is the nurse of youthful passion—in this I was fully indulged at Seymour Castle, being allowed to pass my time in a manner most suitable to my own inclination, whilst Lady Laura was engaged with her several masters, who yet daily attended her. I had at the same time contracted a habit of reading for several hours in the day, and unfortunately in the late Coun∣tess's library met with several novels, a sort of reading with which my dear girls are totally unacquainted; these books served only to soften my mind and encrease my passion, so that by never attempting to repel it in its first approach, it in time gained an entire ascendency over my heart, formed a part of my existence, twined round the chords of life, and can be extinguish∣ed only by the hand of death.</P>
<P>Here Dorcas paused to give vent to her tears; Marian wept with her; Lydia threw her arms round her mother's neck, and kissing off the drops as they fell upon her cheeks, vowed that no action of hers should ever increase the an∣guish
<PB N="91" REF="027654_0091_0FD5685A8983B310"/>
which already weighed down her too sus∣ceptible heart. They then retired for the night, Lydia to the soft repose that ever attends youth and innocence; Marian to reflect on the fine things Sir George had said, and Dorcas to weep over past afflictions.</P>

<PB N="92" REF="027654_0092_0FD5685D812219A0"/>
<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF DORCAS CONTINUED. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THE sun had just darted his rays upon the distant mountains, the dew still glittered on the waving grass, when Dorcas forsook her restless couch, and summoned her daughters to their daily labour, having paid their adoration to the divine disposer of all things, and partook of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> breakfast, she again continued her recital.</P>
<P>For several mornings after the explanation I mentioned, I repaired as usual to the garden, but Melfont did not join me, indeed he seemed particularly studious to avoid every opportunity of conversing with me without a third person be∣ing present. I was extremely uneasy at this con∣duct, I imagined he supposed me too much his
<PB N="93" REF="027654_0093_0FD5685E979AE860"/>
inferior to be made the honorable partner of his fortune, and in my heart I thanked him for that honor, which prevented his soliciting me on other terms; yet the visible constraint he put upon him∣self in attempting to appear chearful, pained me excessively; I became absent, melancholy and dejected.</P>
<P>Lady Laura frequently interrogated me in her lively manner on the cause of my altered diposi∣tion, and one morning when Melfont was in the room, she jocularly said, "Why, my good cou∣sin Charles, what in the name of wonder possesses you to be so dull, one would think some enchant∣ment prevailed at Seymour Castle, and that the very air was infections, here is my lively Dory, metamorphosed into musing melancholy; and you, my late giddy cousin become the grave sen∣timental philosopher. I verily believe a certain blind deity has been busy with you, come hither, Charles, let me see where the arrow entered, is the wound deep?"</P>
<P>Melfont answered rather peevishy, and left the room. I felt my face glow and my heart throbbed violently, Lady Laura saw my emotion, "Poor dear, said he, did it fall in love, and had it no hope; well, well, never mind it, 'twas all invo∣luntary I'll be sworn."</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="027654_0094_0FD5685FDE90A948"/>
Oh! Lady Laura, said I, despise me not for my weakness.—I could say no more, tears burst from my eyes, and I hid my face with my hand∣kerchief.</P>
<P>"My dear Dory, said she, taking my hand, I did not mean to pain your gentle heart, I have long seen the tenderness subsisting between my cousin and you, and assure you it has given me peculiar pleasure; but my sweet little friend, you must be rather cautious to guard your secret, for should my father discover it, he will use every method to prevent an union between you ever tak∣ing place, for Charles Melfont is designed by him the husband of your Laura."</P>
<P>Had I been transfixed by lightning, my coun∣tenance could not have expressed more horror and surprize. I felt in a moment that I must ap∣pear a monster of ingratitude in the eyes of the Earl, when he should find I had thus, though unintentionally counteracted his designs, in re∣gard to his daughter's future settlement. I told Lady Laura, after what I had just heard, I should think myself unpardonable to remain any longer at Seymour Castle, or ever suffer Melfont to en∣tertain me again in the character of a lover. I requested her to suffer me to return home, and said, I would, if possible, avoid ever seeing him again.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="027654_0095_0FD56861B2E82A60"/>
She laughed at what she called my delicate scruples, and told me, she had in her own mind planned out future schemes of happiness for us all; for to tell you the truth, said she, I have no great inclination to Charles, being engaged both by inclination and solemn promises, to a young man of no great fortune, though of a good family; he is at present only an ensign in the guards, so that I am certain my father will never consent to our union; but you know, my dear Dory, if you accept Melfont, I can then avow my choice openly, and you will at once render yourself happy, and confer an obligation on your friend.</P>
<P>In this manner did the artful Laura work on my feelings, and at length won Melfont over to her party. We were frequently witnesses to pri∣vate interviews between her lover and herself, and in a short time so far forgot what was due to our parents, and to our own interest and honor, that we not only planned her escape but accom∣panied her flight, and the same ceremony united Lady Laura to Mr. Walsh, and your mother to Melfont.</P>
<P>When we returned to Seymour Castle we found it a seat of tumult and confusion; the Earl refused us admittance, and my father, irritated at my in∣gratitude to his patron and benefactor, would not suffer me to enter his habitation, nor did I from
<PB N="96" REF="027654_0096_0FD56862CC8AD890"/>
that unhappy day ever see him; my behaviour had made such an impression on his mind, that he fell into a deep melancholy, which soon put a period to his existence; the whole of his possessi∣ons were left to his nearest male relation, and my name was only mentioned in the will, that he might reprobate my ingratitude.</P>
<P>I can truly say, the affliction I felt when in∣formed of his decease, proceeded solely from the reflection, that I deserved his anger, and had not seen him or endeavoured to gain his pardon be∣fore his death.</P>
<P>The anguish of my heart was beyond expressi∣on, but the unremitting tenderness which I ex∣perienced from my husband soon hushed my griefs to rest, and I became tranquil, and even happy.—Alas! this scene of serene pleasure was not long to last; it fleeted away like a visi∣on, and like a passing shadow left no trace behind.</P>
<P>One year of connubial love was past, when you, my beloved girls, were in one day ushered into the world. Melfont was disappointed, he had hoped for a boy, as his family had never been reconciled to what they termed so dispropor∣tionate a match, he imagined such an event might in some measure have conciliated their regard,
<PB N="97" REF="027654_0097_0FD56865D2CE1640"/>
but the birth of my daughters frustrated these hopes; however he still continued the kind at∣tentive husband.</P>
<P>I lived extremely retired, consoling myself for the loss of every pleasure which a person of my age might wish to enjoy, in Melfont's affection; and while that continued I had no wish ungra∣tified.</P>
<P>Lady Laura frequently visited me; her father had never forgiven her precipitate marriage, nor did he ever give her any fortune.</P>
<P>Walsh had married more from the hope of aggrandizing himself than from any affection he felt for her Ladyship. When he found these hopes were illusive he threw off the mask, and treated her with contempt and unkindness, by which means he rendered her life extremely wretched.</P>
<P>She saw the love and harmony which subsisted between your father and me, and from that spi∣rit of envy which hates to see happiness in ano∣ther family, which it cannot enjoy at home, she determined to undermine my felicity, and ren∣der me as completely wretched as herself.</P>

There is a caprice in the heart of man, or ra∣ther a depravity in their natures, which leads them to neglect and despise a woman totally in their power, and pursue with avidity those who by almost insurmountable obstacles, are placed at a distance from them. This was exactly the case with Melfont. When Lady Laura was offered to him by her father, when wealth and honor would have attended his acceptance of her, he rejected her—but now, irrevocably united to me, and Laura the wife of another, he began to feel a passion for her, and to wish he had not marri∣ed so precipitately.</P>
<P>This passion was at first admitted into his bosom under the mask of pity, he would listen to the frequent complaints she made of her hard fate, soothe her distress, and offer every consolation in his power.</P>
<P>For some time I joined him in endeavouring to alleviate the sorrows of the unhappy Laura; but at length his attentions to her became too pointed to escape the penetrating eye of watchful ten∣derness, and I was unable to stifle that jealousy which I had long strove to suppress.</P>
<P>However afflicted I might be, at the visible al∣teration in your father's manner, I suffered no complaint to break forth, but nursed my corrod∣ing
<PB N="99" REF="027654_0099_0FD568680F171538"/>
sorrows in silence and solitude; in his pre∣sence I endeavoured to appear chearful, though my heart was almost broken by his unkind∣ness.</P>
<P>Two years had passed in this dreadful manner, when Mr. Walsh died, and Lady Laura be∣came a blooming widow. Lord S—, her father, was at that time upon the continent, therefore she had no opportunity to make an im∣mediate personal application to him for reconci∣liation.</P>
<P>Lady Laura had long treated me with a cool hauteur, she now no longer wore even the sem∣blance of politeness, but whenever she came to the house, would either not speak to me at all, or treat me with the most cruel disrespect. I ventured to complain to Melfont of her ungene∣rous behaviour, when his answer struck me al∣most dumb with sorrow and astonishment.</P>
<P>I am surprised, Madam, said he, that you should complain to me in this manner, what right have you to expect particular attention from a woman of Lady Laura's distinction, I think she does you too much honor by condescending to enter the house where you live. You should con∣sider, Dory, you are only my mistress.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="027654_0100_0FD56872CFB5C250"/>
Your mistress, Melfont?</P>
<P>Yes, surely; you know I was under age when the ceremony was performed. I have never in∣troduced you to my family as my wife, nor have they ever considered you as such."</P>
<P>I heard no more, a cold damp came over me, I shuddered and fell lifeless to the floor.—When I recovered, I found your cruel father had left me, in that state of insensibility, to the care of the servants. I gave free vent to my sorrows in a flood of tears, and then summoning all the for∣titude I could to my assistance, called for pen and ink, and wrote a letter to Melfont, a copy of which I have preserved.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MELFONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you inform me I am not your wife, be assured I retain too high a sense of honor to remain with you on any other terms; but do not flatter yourself! mean tamely to give up a title which I think I have an undoubted right to, hav∣ing received it at the altar, and borne it three years, during which time I have never disgraced it by thought, word, or action. Before you re∣ceive
<PB N="101" REF="027654_0101_0FD5686B0A014780"/>
this, I shall be far advanced on my way to∣wards Paris, where I mean to submit my cause to the decision of the Earl of S—, who, though I have greatly injured, is the only person I can at this time with propriety apply to, or hope to re∣ceive assistance from. I know him to be a noble∣man of too much honor and humanity to suffer an insult offered to an unprotected woman to go un∣revenged. He is the friend of the widow and the fatherless, and in that rank I must place my∣self, and your unhappy children, till you restore me to that which no action of mine has ever for∣feited.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate, but injured wife, DORCAS MELFONT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When I had finished this letter I ordered a chaise and four, and bidding the servant put up a few things, took you, my beloved girls, and desiring the letter might be delivered to your father when he came home, which I knew would not be till late at night, set off full speed to Dover.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027654_0102_0FD56870124B8090"/>
We travelled all night, and was lucky enough to arrive just as a packet was sailing for Calais, I immediately embarked, a few hours wafted us across the channel, and I then travelled with as much speed as possible to Paris. It was late when I arrived, and being greatly fatigued with my journey, I determined to stay till the next morn∣ing before I waited on the Earl. I took an hasty supper and retired, in hope to recruit my ex∣hausted frame by sleep.</P>
<P>The next morning I arose early, and dressing myself, took my dear children in my hand, and repaired to the Earl's. I was with difficulty ad∣mitted, and when I entered the room where his Lordship was at breakfast, my agitation was so great I could scarcely stand.</P>
<P>Dorcas! said his Lordship, starting from his seat.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord, said I, (throwing myself at his feet, and presenting my girls to him) behold a miserable woman and two helpless infants, who without your assisting hand must be plunged in infamy and inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>Rise, Dorcas, said his Lordship, explain your∣self, your agitation at present deranges your ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="027654_0103_0FD56869B2F1F248"/>
I then in a few words told him, that Melfont had disowned me for his wife, and that I was cer∣tain he meant to marry Lady Laura.</P>
<P>Heaven forbid, said the Earl, that my poor in∣fatuated girl should add such an heinous offence against humanity, to the catalogue of her former crimes. Oh! Dorcas, her undutiful behaviour has been like a viper preying upon my heart; and to increase my affliction, I have been told she has dishonored even the man for whom she forsook her father's protection. But this will be an act to make honor and humanity blush. Be comforted, continued he, for the sake of these poor inno∣cents, I will not suffer your wrongs to pass unno∣ticed or unredressed. Cheared by these kind ex∣pressions I returned to my lodgings, with a heart considerably lightened, and was desired to call on the Earl again in about ten days, when he should have had time to consult what was best to be done. On the appointed morning I repaired to the Earl, I found him seated at a table writing, a letter lay unfolded before him.</P>
<P>Dorcas, said he, (rising and leading me to a seat) I have received letters from England since I saw you.</P>
<P>Do they mention me, my Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="027654_0104_0FD5687427FA67D0"/>
Yes, they say you have long led a very disso∣lute life, and that you have eloped from your hus∣band with a young officer, and taken with you a quantity of money and jewels.</P>
<P>Heaven forgive them, said I, and burst into tears.</P>
<P>But this is not all, my poor girl, continued the Earl, you have worse trials than this to encoun∣ter.</P>
<P>Then I hope God will give me fortitude to support them, said I, but indeed my heart is al∣most broke already. However, my Lord, let me know the worst, and I will endeavour to bear it with patience.</P>
<P>Melfont is married to Lady Laura.</P>
<P>Cruel Melfont, how have I deserved this inhu∣man usage.</P>
<P>After you left me the other day, said the Earl, I sent a messenger express to endeavour to procure a certificate of your marriage, and to take a letter to Laura, promising pardon and forgetfulness of all that was past if she would not marry Melfont, but in case she chose to follow the bent of her own depraved inclination, to never assure the title of
<PB N="105" REF="027654_0105_0FD568758A322738"/>
my daughter again, for from that moment I would disown her. My messenger returned yesterday, and informs me, it is impossible to procure a cer∣tificate, as the clergyman who married you was dead, and that the day after you left England, Melfont publicly espoused Lady Laura.</P>
<P>Merciful heaven, said I, (sinking on my knees) to your care I commit my dear injured children. Oh! suffer them not to be punished for the sins of their parents; make me the object of thy wrath for my disobedience and ingratitude, but Oh! of thy infinite mercy avert the shafts of keen adver∣sity from the bosom of my beloved girls.</P>
<P>The Earl was affected, he dropped a tear in compassion to my anguish, and promised to be my protector. The next day he gave me a deed, in which he settled this cottage and its appendages, with one hundred pounds a year, on me during my life, and to be continued to my children as long as they by their conduct should merit his protection. I remained in France a few days, just to recruit my strength and spirits, and then set forward for this place, where I have lived now seventeen years, endeavouring to form the minds of my children in such a manner, that the follies which occasioned their mother misfortunes might never find entrance in their hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="027654_0106_0FD5687AAC8118D0"/>
Oh! Marian, listen not to the voice of adula∣tion, stifle every rising ambitious thought, be hum∣ble, be innocent, and be happy.</P>

<HEAD>MARIAN AND LYDIA CONTINUED. PART IV.</HEAD>
<P>MARIAN listened attentively to the affect∣ing recital of her mother's sorrow, but eve∣ry syllable sunk deep into the heart of Lydia. I will daily think of your distresses, my dear mo∣ther, said she, and they will serve as a shield to my heart, and render it invulnerable to the at∣tacks of vanity or the illusion of passion.</P>
<P>And is my father living? said Marian.</P>
<P>I know not, replied her mother, but if he is, he can never be any thing to you, he has renoun∣ced us all.</P>
<P>It was inhuman, my dear mother, to deprive us
<PB N="04" REF="027654_0110_0FD5687E8C455B80"/>
of that rank in life, we were born to fill, and which I flatter myself we should not have disgra∣ced.</P>
<P>Foolish Marian, said the anxious mother, why regret the loss of such a trifle: be virtuous, my child, you will then elevate the most humiliating station, and rise superior to those whose only boast is wealth and titles, to render them the envy of the blind misguided multitude. Virtue alone is true nobility; content is real happiness.</P>
<P>Lydia's heart responsive echoed her mother's sentiments—Marian sighed and was silent.</P>
<P>The moon in majestic splendor illumined the sky, and darted her silver beams through the anci∣ent elms that shaded Dorcas's cottage. The sisters were feated by the door, and in obedience to their mother's command, were pouring forth their thanksgiving to the giver of all blessing in an evening hymn. They had just finished when a rustling among the bushes made them start; a beautiful pointer ran into the cottage, and in a moment a servant in livery appeared, and enqui∣red the way to Gwinfred-Hall. Dorcas directed him which way to go. He said he was weary, re∣quested a drop of water, and leave to rest. Lydia went to fetch him some cyder, Dorcas moved to∣wards
<PB N="05" REF="027654_0111_0FD56881E8D8E4D8"/>
the door, and silently admired the beauty of the spangled firmament.</P>
<P>The man seized the opportunity, and delivered to the lovely unsuspecting Marian a letter from Sir George Lovemore.</P>
<P>Love and ambition had already taught her art, she hastily took the offered letter, and hid it in her bosom. Alas! simple maid, you there fostered a serpent, whose subtle poison tainted your very heart. The servant having completed his errand retired, and Marian found means to peruse her letter;—it abounded with professions of love, vows of everlasting fidelity, and encomiums on her beauty. She read it with rapture, and though so recently warned of the duplicity of men, be∣lieved every syllable it contained. In conclusion, he solicited a private interview the next morning, in the field adjoining her mother's cottage. Marian paused at this request, hesitated—read the letter again and resolved to comply.</P>
<P>During supper she was thoughtful and absent, and when the usual hour of rest arrived, she re∣tired with an anxious perturbed mind; sleep was a stranger to her eyes, and several times she almost resolved to shew the letter to Lydia, and re∣quest her to accompany her—But then Sir
<PB N="06" REF="027654_0112_0FD56883CFB2CC80"/>
George had desired her to come alone, he might be offended and she might never see him again. Vanity also pleaded, he might marry her, raise her to an exalted station, and should his views be otherwise than honorable, she certainly had re∣solution to withstand his solicitations.</P>
<P>In this manner did she wear out the tedious night, at five o'clock she stole softly from the side of her innocent sleeping sister, and with as little noise as possible opened the door that led into the fields. Aurora had but faintly streaked the east∣ern skies with mingled gold and purple, when the ill-fated Marian met her lover.</P>
<P>He thanked her for her condescention, told her his whole happiness depended on her, and urged her immediate flight with him to London.</P>
<P>Marian hesitated, her mother, her sister, hung heavy at her heart.</P>
<P>Sir George was an adept in the art of seduction, he talked of gaiety, splendor and pleasure, swore she was born to grace the first station, declared it was a crime to bury so much beauty and sweetness in a desart.</P>
<P><PB N="07" REF="027654_0113_0FD5688581444B88"/>
Marian's reason was not convinced, but her vanity was awakened and her senses dazzled, what wonder then that her scruples were over∣come by Sir George's artful persuasions. She left the mansion of peace and innocence, and in a chaise which he had prepared for the purpose, hurried as fast as four horses would carry her to the seat of dissipation and folly.</P>
<P>Marian dropped a tear as she took a last look at the cottage, but Sir George kissed it off, and the reflection which had caused it to start was instantly banished from her mind.</P>
<P>Lydia on awakening missed her sister, and hastily rising, ran into her mother's apartment, vexed that Marian should have been the first to bid her good morning. I am not used to be such a slug∣gard, my dear mother, said she, but my sister has received your blessing before me this morning. I have not seen your sister, said Dorcas, but as it is a fine morning, she has, no doubt, rambled out to enjoy its sweets; go, my beloved Lydia and seek her.</P>
<P>Lydia left her mother, and sought her sister in the fields and woods; echo a thousand times repeat∣ed the name as she called her dear Marian; at length fatigued and dispirited, she was returning
<PB N="08" REF="027654_0114_0FD5688816265960"/>
home, when she met a shepherd, who early attend∣ed his sheep, that way, and demanded of him whether he had seen her sister.</P>
<P>He had seen her, he saw her enter the chaise with Sir George, he saw them drive off.</P>
<P>Lydia heard the heart-rending tidings, she would have wept, but tears refused their relief; she sighed, raised her hands to heaven in an ago∣ny of grief, and sunk lifeless upon the ground. The shepherd was frightened, nor did he use any method to restore her, but ran backward and forward, looking wildly round him, and calling aloud for help. A young gentleman who had been that morning out a shooting, heard the voice of terror, and hastened to the spot where the hap∣less Lydia lay. Her charms were not of the daz∣zling sort, but the more her features were examin∣ed the more they interested the beholder. The gentleman when he first raised her from the ground, felt only for her as he would for any other woman in distress; but when he looked attentively on her face, and beheld her lovely though inanimate fea∣tures, he felt an irresistible impulse to defend her not only from her present uneasiness, but to shield her for ever from pain and affliction. He carried her to a spring, and bathed her temples with water, she opened her expressive blue eyes, Oh! my un∣happy sister, said she, and freeing herself from the
<PB N="09" REF="027654_0115_0FD56889E70F7748"/>
arms of her deliverer, covered her face with her hands, and gave free vent to her tears.</P>
<P>Have you lost your sister, my sweet maid, said the stranger.</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, replied Lydia, I fear my poor Marian is worse than dead. A gentleman has found means to ensnare her innocent unsuspecting heart, and she has this morning left her only friends to trust the promises of one she never saw till three days since. I know not how to return to my poor mo∣ther with these fatal tidings, I fear it will go near to break an heart already oppressed with woes al∣most too heavy to be borne. "But God temper∣eth the wind to the shorn lamb," continued she, raising her eyes to heaven, and no doubt will in∣spire her with fortitude to bear, without repining, this heaviest of his trials.</P>
<P>The stranger reverenced her sorrow, he took her passive hand, drew it under his arm, and so proceeded silently along towards Dorcas's cottage; he attempted not to interrupt her grief, but now and then a tear stole down his manly cheeks, and a responsive sigh answered hers.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the cottage Dorcas met them at the door; Lydia flew towards her, fold∣ed her arms round her neck, and dropping her
<PB N="10" REF="027654_0116_0FD5688B4ABEEE48"/>
head on her bosom, sobbed aloud.</P>
<P>Oh! my beloved, said Dorcas, tell me, has any accident happened to your sister?</P>
<P>She is gone, said Lydia.</P>
<P>What, forever? cried the fond mother eagerly.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear mother, she is lost to us; that gen∣tleman whom we met—</P>
<P>Enough, said Dorcas, I fully understand the extent of my misfortune; my Marian is disho∣nored, plunged in infamy; but I will not renounce her, she is my child. Oh! heavens, none but a parent can judge of the anguish that now har∣rows up my soul. But, my sweet Lydia, will you forsake your mother in her old age, will you leave her grey hairs to sink in sorrow to the grave, without a friend to chear her last moments, with∣out the gentle hand of filial love to close her dying eyes.</P>
<P>Oh! no, cried Lydia, dropping on her knees, never, never; when I forsake my honor'd mother, may heaven regardless hear me when I pray, may I be cast out to sickness, pain and poverty, with∣out a friend to pity or relieve me.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027654_0117_0FD5688CF32287C8"/>
Dorcas embraced her, and the stranger endea∣voured to dissipate the drops of humanity which were gathering in her eyes. Lydia by degrees became more composed, and informed her mother of the obligations she was under to the gentleman who had accompanied her home.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, said Dorcas, you are my friend and benefactor, had I lost my Lydia I had lost my all; but say, by what name shall I remember you in my prayers?</P>
<P>They call me Renfew, Earl of Landaff, said he.</P>
<P>Dorcas started and turned pale—the Earl continued,</P>
<P>Your sorrow has awakened in my breast every feeling of humanity, and if it is in my power to be of any service to you, command me, and I will exert it to the utmost.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear Marian! said Dorcas.</P>
<P>I understand you, replied the Earl, and wish I could restore her to you, but as that is not in my power, teach me by some other means to promote your happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027654_0118_0FD56891A81EE3A8"/>
My Lord, said Dorcas, there is but one way to give the least satisfaction to this afflicted heart; leave the cottage immediately, nor ever attempt again to see or converse with Lydia.</P>
<P>And why this cruel restriction?</P>
<P>Time, my Lord, perhaps may inform you with my reasons for acting thus. At present I cannot alledge the true cause, and will never stoop to a mean equivocation to excuse an action, which I am sensible is perfectly right.</P>
<P>The Earl was piqued, he bowed and left the cottage.</P>
<P>Lydia, said Dorcas, if you love your mother, you will avoid the Earl of Landaff.</P>
<P>He is generous and humane, said Lydia,</P>
<P>Trust not to appearances, replied her mother, when you shall learn a tale which I could tell you, you will then, like me, tremble at the name of Renfew.</P>
<P>Peace, with the speed of a courier, now fled from the mansion of Dorcas, affliction usurped her place, and with solemn pace each night walk∣ed with the solitary Lydia over those fields and
<PB N="13" REF="027654_0119_0FD5688ED19B4F18"/>
meadows where she once had cheerfully tripped with her beloved Marian.</P>
<P>In one of these melancholy excursions she was accosted by the Earl of Landaff; she would have fled, but he prevented her, and in the most elo∣quent language true love could inspire, told her how dear she was to him, and how cruel he thought her mother, in refusing him the pleasure of her conversation.</P>
<P>My mother, replied Lydia, can be actuated by no motive but a wish to promote my happiness. I esteem you, my Lord, I shall ever remember you with gratitude, but my mother has forbid me to hold any conversation with you. Adieu, Sir, I often think of you, but will never have any intercourse with you.</P>
<P>Stay, my sweet Lydia, said the Earl, only say you do not hate me. I swear, dear maid, my de∣signs are honorable, and if you will put yourself under my protection, a private marriage shall convince you how sincere my professions are.</P>
<P>My Lord, replied Lydia, though I acknow∣ledge myself honored by this declaration, I must decline accepting your offer; I know my rank in life is far beneath what would be expected in the bride of Landaff, but humble as I am, I will
<PB N="14" REF="027654_0120_0FD56894211062D0"/>
never become the wife of a man who would be ashamed publicly to own me as such; nor will I ever clandestinely converse with a person whom my mother has forbid me to see. My sister, I fear, by her disobedience, has rendered herself miserable, nor will I, by a like conduct, increase the affliction of my dear venerable parent.</P>
<P>Landaff expatiated on the many advantages attending wealth and splendor; Lydia heard him with silent contempt. He told her his only wish was, to make her happy.</P>
<P>That is impossible, my Lord, said she, the heart of Lydia never can know happiness while her mo∣ther is in affliction, and her sister, perhaps, a miserable wanderer, exposed to all the wretch∣edness, want and infamy can entail on a fallen woman.</P>
<P>All farther persuasion was of no effect, Lydia continued firm in her resolution of not leaving her mother, and fearful of again meeting the importunate Earl, avoided for some time her favorite walk, confined herself to the narrow limits of their garden, and devoted her time entirely to comfort and chear her afflicted parent.</P>
<P>The Earl finding no hope of success in draw∣ing Lydia from her duty, and having too much
<PB N="15" REF="027654_0121_0FD56895D5BEF888"/>
regard for virtue to force himself into their soli∣tude, with an intent to rob them of their only treasure, repaired to London, thinking time and absence would effectually banish her from his memory.</P>
<P>We will now leave Lydia, following her usual innocent avocations, and return to Marian, who was emerged in the vortex of fashionable folly.</P>
<P>When Sir George persuaded the unsuspecting Marian to leave her home, and trust to his honor for protection, she had no doubt but his design was to marry her; he had never told her so indeed, but surely he could mean nothing less—he had declared he loved her, and did not men always marry the women they loved? Thus with fallacious hopes did she quiet each rising fear, and by painting to herself the pleasure her mo∣ther and sister would experience when they should embrace her as Lady Lovemore, entirely oblite∣rated the pain she felt in reflecting on the unea∣siness they would suffer when her flight should be discovered.</P>
<P>Sir George had never formed an idea of mak∣ing her his wife, he saw she was beautiful, he felt he loved her, and thought by lavishing on her
<PB N="16" REF="027654_0122_0FD56897612E2018"/>
riches and finery, to which she had hitherto been unaccustomed, to ensnare and lead her an easy victim to be sacrificed at the shrine of vice. To this end he forbore taking any liberty during their journey which might alarm her, treated her with respect and tender attention, and when they arri∣ved in London placed her in an elegant lodging, with proper servants to wait on her, and left her to ruminate at leisure on the change in her situati∣on.</P>
<P>The female attendant who was immediately a∣bout the person of Marian, was a girl who had for∣merly fallen a prey to the arts of Sir George, and now only enjoyed his bounty for reducing other hapless females to the horrid level with herself. She was wretched in the loss of her own virtue, and like the spoiler of mankind, exulted in every opportunity of robbing others of that blessing her∣self could no longer enjoy. She treated the inno∣cent Marian with the most profound respect, led her through a suit of superb apartments and told her, if she could think of any thing that would add to the elegance or beauty of the furni∣ture, she need only mention her wishes to have them complied with. She next displayed a variety of elegant female apparel, toys, jewels, and other things proper to catch the attention of inexperi∣enced youth, and kindle the glowing seeds of vanity into a flame that might consume her.
<PB N="17" REF="027654_0123_0FD5689A24B42DE0"/>
She descanted on the beauty, gallantry and gene∣rosity of Sir George, nor left the poor bewildered girl, 'till she had seen her in bed, and fast locked in the embraces of Morpheus.</P>
<P>Sophia, for that was the name of Marian's attendant, had learnt the part she was to act from an old woman, to whom Sir George had wrote the day before he left Gwinfred-Hall. She knew it would not be prudent to give the artless girl any time for reflection, or to suffer her thoughts to recur to the friends she had left in Wales. She therefore entered her apartment at an earlier hour than is customary for town-bred ladies to rise; she was still asleep.</P>
<P>Sophia watched the moment of awaking, and hurrying her to rise, prevented the intrusion of busy or perplexing thoughts. She was attired in a fashionable undress, and before she had time sufficiently to admire either herself or the beauty of the breakfast apparatus, Sir George was an∣nounced.</P>
<P>Marian was now hurried from one scene of dissipation to another for several days, she was introduced to a large circle of those unhappy women, who purchase ease and luxury at the price of honor.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="027654_0124_0FD5689B47BDCBD8"/>
She was charmed with the gaiety of their man∣ners and the vivacity of their conversation. Their precepts, their example, corrupted her heart, and she began to think a life of licentious love (falsly termed a life of liberty) was alone a life of happiness—She forgot her afflicted mo∣ther, forgot her innocent affectionate sister, for∣got every precept of virtue and religion, and fell a voluntary sacrifice to Sir George.</P>
<P>For many months folly wore the 'semblance of pleasure, and riot and intemperance were mis∣taken for felicity. But alas! the wretched Marian too late awoke to a sense of her miserable situa∣tion.</P>
<P>Sir George, attracted by a newer face, forsook her; refused her pecuniary assistance, and even had the unfeeling villainy to betray her into the power of one of his libertine companions.</P>
<P>At first her grief was violent, but she had been taught a method to stifle the emotions of her heart by drowning her reason in repeated draughts of strong liquors. She was soon lost to every sense of shame, and from being once the admiration of the croud wherever she moved, became an object of contempt, and sunk to the horrid state of common prostitution.</P>

<P>IT was a cold evening in autumn, the wind was bleak, the rain fell heavily, when pinched with famine and shivering with the chilling blasts, Marian wandered, unfriended and unpitied, round Berkley-Square.—She had several times essayed to stop the passengers, and intreat charity, but there was yet a spark of pride remained unsubdued, which made the supplication appear too humilia∣ting.</P>
<P>She drew near a door where a carriage was wait∣ing—Major Renfew came from the house, and entered it; by the light of a flambeau, which shone on her face, he discovered Marian—her features were yet lovely, though pale, and strong∣ly marked by the oppressive finger of poverty. The Major bockoned her forward—Who are you said he, surveying her with a scrutinizing eye, and why does your countenance wear this appear∣ance of misery?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="027654_0126_0FD5689F566CB518"/>
Alas! replied Marian, it is the true index of my heart! I am the daughter of folly and infamy, but though I own my punishment just, I cannot bear it without complaining—I cannot starve in silence!</P>
<P>Various were the emotions that agitated the heart of Major Renfew while he gazed on the face of Marian; at first he felt something like huma∣nity stirring in his bosom, but at the second glance it was a more lively emotion, he gave her a guinea, and appointing her to meet him at ten o'clock, at a house he mentioned, drove off to pay some visits of ceremony.</P>
<P>Marian felt a warm glow of gratitude play round her heart, she could have knelt and kissed the hand that had thus seasonably administered relief. She waited impatiently for the hour of ten, when she might thank her benefactor as she ought.</P>
<P>Major Renfew was a man of gallantry, he had been some years separated from his wife, and indulged himself in frequent casual intrigues, which did no great honor either to the brilliancy of his taste, or the goodness of his heart.</P>
<P>The beauty of Marian, though greatly impair∣ed by intemperance, was yet striking; the Major
<PB N="21" REF="027654_0127_0FD568A05EC49E10"/>
at that time was without a favorite, and from the prepossession he felt in his bosom towards our poor wanderer, he determined to raise her from the ab∣ject state to which she was reduced, to the <HI>honorable</HI> station of his mistress; he therefore dispatched his visits as quick as possible, and repaired to the place of appointment.</P>
<P>Marian met him at the door of the apartment, he gave her his hand, she raised it to her lips, and attempted to speak, but words were refused, a gush of silent tears more eloquently spoke her soul's meaning—the Major was moved, he made her sit down, and placing himself beside her, began to unfold the designs he had formed in her favour.</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, said Marian mournfully, I had hoped you would have taken me from this life of shame, indeed I am sick of what is termed pleasure, I long to sink into peaceful obscurity, and having just sufficient to supply the wants of nature, re∣pent my past misdeeds, and wait with patience the appointed hour of rest. I know not why it is, but I feel I never can return your generosity in the way you require, and therefore dare not hope for farther favours.</P>
<P>Nay, my dear girl, said the Major, this is affectation; come shake off this gloom which your
<PB N="22" REF="027654_0128_0FD568A1D07CA848"/>
misfortunes have occasioned to envelope your mind—what, though I am an old man, I will teach you to love me.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, replied Marian, you have taught me that already, there is nothing which I should think too hard to perform, to convince you of the grateful affections of my heart. But I had hoped this sinking fragile frame never would have known pollution more.</P>
<P>The Major endeavoured to calm the perturbati∣on of her spirits, and pressed her to partake of some excellent champaigne which he had ordered with the supper. Marian was thoughtful, eat little, and frequently turned her head to hide the starting tears.</P>
<P>Supper removed he renewed his solicitations, she sunk on her knees, and with uplifted hands entreated him to grant her relief on other terms, or suffer her to leave him, and again tempt the miseries of her hard destiny. He was deaf to her prayers, he attributed them to art—he raised her from the ground, and proceeded to unwarrantable liberties—she made a violent effort, and springing from his arms, cried, Oh! Dorcas, dear unhap∣py mother, why did I leave you,—then rushing out of the room, ran precipitately into the street.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="027654_0129_0FD568A34C3AB4F0"/>
The exclamation which she made had thrown the Major into a stupor of astonishment, every faculty was suspended, nor could he recover sufficient recollection to endeavour to stop her—a thousand past occurrences rushed upon his mind, and he remained immoveable, his eyes rivetted to the door through which she had passed.</P>
<P>At length recovering from his surprise, he obser∣ved a small shagreen case which lay on the floor, and during her struggles had dropped from Mari∣an's bosom. He took it up, with emotion opened it, and the portrait of Dorcas met his eyes. The case dropped from his unnerved hand, he groaned and fell senseless to the floor, the noise of his fall brought up a servant of the house, proper remedies were applied and soon restored him to a keen sense of his past guilt and treachery to Dorcas, for Major Renfew was the perjured husband whom Dorcas had concealed under the name of Melfont.</P>
<P>The first thought that struck him was the horrid crime he had so nearly perpetrated; the next was what was become of his poor ruined child—His continual ravings for his Marian, his dear lost daughter, and the evident incoherence of his discourse led the servants to believe he was seized with a sudden fit of insanity, and in that belief conveyed him home.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="027654_0130_0FD568A6521009E8"/>
The horror that dwelt upon his mind, and the violent agitation brought on a fever, and before morning he was insensible to all that passed about him. Before reason entirely forsook him, he was visited by the Earl of Landaff, who was his nephew, to him he unfolded the dreadful tale, conjuring him to try every possible method to discover the unhappy wanderer.</P>
<P>Oh! said he in an agony, "she knelt and prayed, my child entreated me, with streaming eyes, to snatch her from infamy, and I would not hear her,—seek her Landaff, find her, save her from perishing for want." The remembrance was too acute, and his senses, which were before wa∣vering, took their flight—but still his fancy was haunted by the image of Dorcas and Marian, and his agonies became dreadful, even to those who attended him.</P>
<P>Every enquiry after the hapless Marian was fruitless, and the miserable Renfew, when a turn of his disorder restored him to reason, found that there was no hope of recovering the poor wanderer—</P>
<P>The picture discovered to the Earl of Landaff that Dorcas was the mother and Lydia the sister of the woman who had caused such anxious emo∣tions in his uncle's bosom, but how Lydia and
<PB N="25" REF="027654_0131_0FD568A84E774AF8"/>
Marian should be the daughters of Major Ren∣few appeared to him an inexplicable riddle. His uncle soon unravelled the mystery, and received some consolation from hearing that Dorcas was living, and that he might hope to embrace one innocent child, in his Lydia.</P>
<P>He determined to seek Dorcas in her solitude, and acknowledge her to the world as his first and only true affianced wife; but fearing to alarm her by too abrupt an appearance, he addressed her first by letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO DORCAS.</HEAD>
<P>BY what title shall I address you, dear in∣jured excellence, but by that which must make me appear what I really am—the vilest, the basest of mankind.—</P>
<P>Oh! Dorcas, cruel as my conduct was to you, my punishment, I trust, has been equal to my fault—alas! the crimes of the father have been visited upon the child. Oh! my beloved, will not your gentle heart break when I shall tell you I have seen our dear Marian—I have seen her a wretched nightly wanderer—I heard her implore charity, I saw her overpow∣ered
<PB N="26" REF="027654_0132_0FD568A969737340"/>
with anguish of heart, and relieved her not, but drove her from me, drove her again upon the merciless world, exposed to all the miseries of want!—But my old tough heart will not burst, though it swells and throbs at the remembrance of that dreadful evening.</P>
<P>My Dorcas, I will do you justice, I will de∣clare to the world your injuries and my own perfidy. Prepare my love, to meet your penitent Renfew soon after the receipt of this, and bid my sweet, my innocent Lydia, prepare to receive a father's blessing.</P>
<P>Adieu. Many days shall not pass e'er I hope to hear you pronounce my pardon, and clasp you to the heart of your repentant husband,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>From the day of Marian's elopement pleasure had been a stranger to the heart of Dorcas, nor could all the duteous tenderness of Lydia dissi∣pate the anxiety she felt for the fate of Marian from her maternal breast. Nor did joy now sparkle in the eye of Lydia, the tear of sorrow had quenched their lustre, and like a canker∣worm had fed upon her cheek, and stole from
<PB N="27" REF="027654_0133_0FD568AACEE2A370"/>
thence the blushing rose. Full oft she wept her hapless sister's fall, full oft she sighed and wished to hear again of Landaff, but her tears fell only on her pillow, when the sable curtain of night hid them from the prying eye of maternal affec∣tion, and her sighs stole forth when no one was nigh to hear them.</P>

<P>'TWAS night, a chearful fire illumined their little cottage, but sorrow still sat heavy on the heart of Dorcas—the wind blew, the cold rain beat against the casement; and where now is my poor Marian? said she, sighing deeply.</P>
<P>I will sing you your favorite hymn, said Lydia, kissing off a tear as it fell on her mother's cheek, and struggling to suppress its sympathising sister that trembled in her own eye.</P>
<P>She took up her guitar, she wished to divert her mother's attention from the painful reflections which then occupied her thoughts; she passed her fingers across the strings, the tones were discordant, it is not in tune, said she. Alas! my dear Lydia, replied her mother, it is our minds that are not harmonized. She understood the meaning of her mother's words, but, making no answer, began to
<PB N="29" REF="027654_0135_0FD568AF0DC0C468"/>
sing an evening hymn of thanks. The sudden trampling of a horse interrupted her, a loud rapping at the door alarmed them—Lydia opened the door, a servant entered. Dorcas looked earnestly at him; he threw aside his rid∣ing coat, she knew the livery, and instantly re∣cognized an old and favorite servant of Major Renfew.</P>
<P>Simon, said she, turning pale and rising as she spoke, why are you here?</P>
<P>My dear honored lady, I come from my mas∣ter, who repents his injurious treatment of you, and comes to do you justice; but let this let∣ter speak for him.</P>
<P>And where is Lady Laura, said Dorcas, tak∣ing the letter.</P>
<P>She left my master some years since, and now leads a life of shame.</P>
<P>Poor misguided Laura, said Dorcas, as she broke the seal.</P>
<P>When she read the first lines joy lightened up her features, and a transient glow of pleasure passed across her face; but as she proceeded her hands trembled, her countenance assumed a dead∣ly
<PB N="30" REF="027654_0136_0FD568B0371B9310"/>
hue, and large drops of unutterable anguish, chased each other down her cheeks—the letter fell to the ground, she clasped her hands and raised her eyes towards heaven.</P>
<P>Omnipotent power, said she, teach me to re∣ceive these tidings as I ought, thy mercies and thy judgments go hand in hand. Oh! make me thankful for the one and submissive to the other. Thou hast mingled thy judgments and thy boun∣ties in my cup of life; lest while receiving only benefits I should forget the source from whence those mercies flow. Lydia, continued she, you will receive a father's blessing, but my poor Ma∣rian is lost for ever.</P>
<P>Two days after Major Renfew had dispatched the letter to Dorcas, he set forward for Wales, accompanied by the Earl of Landaff; it was nearly the close of the third day, they had arrived within a few miles of the cottage, and had slack∣ened their pace, that a servant might have time to inform Dorcas of their near approach. The Major's bosom was agitated by the most painful sensations, the Earl was animated by hope. The road was solitary, skirted on one side by a thick wood, from whence they several times imagined they heard a voice of complaint, the Major stopped his horse and stood in the attitude of listen∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027654_0137_0FD568B2C6127568"/>
Ah! woe is me, said the voice, I can get no farther, I must e'en perish here.</P>
<P>Landaff dismounted instantly and rushed into the wood, the Major would have followed but a sudden pang seized him, he respired with dif∣ficulty and was forced to support himself again a tree. In a few moments Landaff returned, a fe∣male rested on his arm, her emaciated frame but slenderly sheltered from the inclemencies of the weather, by a tattered gown; her hair loose and dishevelled, her feet bare and bleeding from wounds she had received from sharp stones, as she walked. Here is a sight of misery, said the Earl.</P>
<P>The Major looked at the unhappy girl, and through the shade which extreme want, sick∣ness, and even disordered reason had cast over her countenance, instantly discovered the fea∣tures of Marian.</P>
<P>Merciful heaven, he exclaimed, it is my child.</P>
<P>Have you a child, said Marian, catching at his last words, then for pity's sake don't forsake her. I had a father once, I had a lover too, but you see how it is with me now, I am poor, very
<PB N="32" REF="027654_0138_0FD568B558FAB2F8"/>
wretched, and I sometimes think not quite in my right senses. I have a mother who lives some∣where here about, I have travelled a long way in hopes to find her, but I know not how it is, I have eat so little, and wept so much, I was obliged to sit down and rest. Do but see how my poor feet bleed.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear child, cried the Major, you make my heart bleed drop for drop with them; but I am going to your mother's, and will shew you the way.</P>
<P>You are a man, said she, and I dare not trust you; they are all hard-hearted, cruel and trea∣cherous. I once, continued she; looking ear∣nestly in the Major's face, I once met a man, but 'tis a long time since, who looked and spoke as you do, only not quite so sorrowful—I was miserable then, and he promised to be my friend, but he did not mean it; he used me very cruelly, I hardly know how I got from him, and have been wandering about ever since, sometimes one cold stone, sometimes another has been my pillow. I bear it as well as I can, we all must suffer according to our offences.</P>
<P>Dear lunatic, said the Major, what a lesson dost thou teach thy father.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="027654_0139_0FD568B6C9A29D20"/>
That is true, said she, you have a child, if it is a daughter, bring her to me, and I will teach her such a lesson—I have it here (laying her hand on her heart) it can never be erased but by the hand of death. Oh! I would tell her such tales of men, would teach her to beware their flat∣tery, to shut herself in retirement, to pray for humility. Oh! fye upon it, fye upon it, 'tis a bad world, but I'll to my mother, for I am sick, heart-sick of its follies.</P>
<P>She then darted precipitately into the wood, but had not proceeded many steps, when over∣come with fatigue, long fasting, and the agita∣tion of her disordered spirits, she sunk under the complicated evils, and fell fainting to the ground.</P>
<P>Renfew was too much absorbed in his own feel∣ings to be able to give any orders concerning his unhappy daughter, and could only exclaim, "These are thy works, oh vice; look, old Ren∣few, behold the ruin of thy child, and remember 'tis the reward of thy own ingratitude, perfidy and cruelty."</P>
<P>Landaff assisted the servants in raising Marian, and being then but a short distance from the cot∣tage, persuaded his uncle to ride forward, accom∣panied by one servant, while he followed with
<PB N="34" REF="027654_0140_0FD568BA704062F0"/>
the other two supporting Marian between them. And is this the peace offering I shall carry to my afflicted Dorcas, a daughter murdered by the inhumanity of a father, said the Major as he proceeded.</P>
<P>Dorcas had been listening to every passing breeze, and counting the minutes, chiding their tardy progress. The sound of horses feet caught her ear, she met her repentant Renfew at the door, threw herself into his arms, and fainted. Lydia knelt and received a father's blessing.</P>
<P>Words are too languid to describe the ensu∣ing scene, suffice it to say, for Marian was for a moment forgot, for a moment they were all happy; but they were awakened from this dream of bliss by the approach of Landaff.</P>
<P>Lydia started as she drew near the door, Renfew struck his forehead with his hand, and bursting from the embraces of Dorcas, rushed out of the room.</P>
<P>Marian was beginning to recover her senses as they entered the cottage. Lydia thought it was a stranger, poor and sickly, and as she lent her arm to assist in leading her in, a tear fell in compassion to her weakness and apparent mi∣sery.
<PB N="35" REF="027654_0141_0FD568BE21165640"/>
Marian sunk into a chair, folded her arms round Lydia's waist, and gazing at her for a moment, recollection and reason at once returned, she dropped her head on her bosom and cried, it is indeed my sister.</P>
<P>The voice was familiar to Dorcas. That voice should be the voice of Marian, said she, but alas! the form retains no traces of my once lovely innocent child.</P>
<P>Innocence and peace are fled together, said Marian, grant me but pardon and let me die at your feet; she sunk upon her knees, Lydia knelt beside her; the afflicted mother wept over her, blessed and forgave her.</P>
<P>Enough, said Marian, this was the only prayer I dared to offer at the throne of grace since I left my home, and became acquainted with guilt and misery; how it has pleased heaven to direct me to you I know not. I have some faint recollec∣tion of an horrid dream, but all things seem fading from my memory, an icy chillness hangs about my heart, I feel the springs of life are quite exhausted.</P>
<P>Oh! spare her, spare my child, merciful heaven, cried Dorcas, sinking on her knees.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="027654_0142_0FD568BF099863F0"/>
It cannot be, said the expiring sufferer, I die, but a mother's blessing softens even the agonies of death, Oh! had I but deserved it.</P>
<P>She raised her hands and eyes in a fervent though inarticulate ejaculation to heaven, and uttering a piercing groan expired.</P>
<P>Renfew heard the groan, he heard the cries of Dorcas and Lydia—"And is she dead, said he, rushing in and catching the pale corse in his arms, Oh! Marian! Marian! why shouldest thou pay the forfeit of thy father's crimes? But tell me, continued he, who was her seducer; who plunged my child into this abyss of misery; teach me where to find him, that with his heart's blood I may wash out the stain he has entailed upon the name of Renfew."</P>
<P>Forbear, said Dorcas, laying her hand upon his arm, while a beam of mingled piety and fortitude illumined her countenance, forbear, the hand of heaven is in it, accept its just chastise∣ments with humility, and remembering only thine own offences, blot from thy memory the offences of others.</P>
<P>Renfew turned from her, folded his arms upon his bosom, and was silent.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="027654_0143_0FD568C0F01F3E90"/>
A few days after the ill-fated Marian was com∣mitted to her parent earth, when Renfew, Dor∣cas, and Lydia removed to the seat of the Earl of Landaff, where in a short time she reaped the full reward of her filial duty and unremitting tender∣ness to her mother, by becoming the bride of that young nobleman. She was the blessing of her parents, the pride and honor of her husband, the friend and preceptress of her children, who re∣paid an hundred fold the pleasure she had con∣veyed to Dorcas's bosom by shewing the same duty and affection to her.</P>
<P>Major Renfew purchased the cottage where his wife and children had lived so many years, and kept it in constant repair; in the garden he had two small temples erected, one was almost hid from the eye, by thick spreading cypress and yew trees, round whose branches twined the deadly night-shade, and baleful ivy; within was a tomb of black marble, over which stood Hu∣manity weeping; on the front of the monument was the following inscription:</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="027654_0144_0FD568C2A1AAC258"/>
Hither let the Daughter of Vanity repair, Look on this silent Monitor, AND REMEMBER MARIAN!</P>
<P><HI>She was fair and sweet as the lily, innocent as the young lamb, but folly misled her, vice betrayed her, and misery closed the final awful scene, in the Twenty-Third Year of her Age.</HI></P>
<P>Beware the voice of flattery, beware the allurements of wealth, nor ask of thy bountiful Creator aught but HUMILITY, VIRTUE AND CONTENT.</P>
<P>The other temple was built of white marble, surrounded by the most beautiful flowering shrubs and evergreens; within was Peace and Prosperity, showering their favors on filial piety; above ho∣vered an Angel with a crown of gold in her hands, round which was this heavenly promise:
<Q><L>Honor thy Parents, and thy Days shall be long in the Land.</L></Q></P>
<P>May this promise ever be present to the re∣membrance of the fair daughters of Britain!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. MENTORIA TO THE MISS WINWORTHS.</HEAD>
<P>STILL am I to complain of the shortness of your letters, and receive the trifling excuse, that you have no time. Fye, my dear girls, I am ashamed to read so very childish an apology, your want of time must proceed from your own bad management, for surely no rational being will give more to the pursuit of amusement than what might just serve to give a zest to retirement; and, believe me, you will find retirement alone the source of true happiness, and promoter of in∣dustry—and on the contrary, an eager pursuit of fashionable folly, which seduces you under the semblance of pleasure, always tends to debilitate the faculties of the mind, and lead you into habits of idleness and indolence at once prejudicial to your tranquillity and interest, not only your tem∣poral, but what is of far more consequence, your spiritual interest.</P>
<P>If, my beloved pupils, you cannot find time once in several weeks to write a few lines to a
<PB N="40" REF="027654_0146_0FD568C6B6F6E088"/>
friend, who regards you with a tenderness nearly maternal; tell me, and tell me truly, I entreat, how much time you can spare to devote each day to the Creator and giver of all good? Ah! my young friends, I fear but a little, very little por∣tion is allotted for that service; yet trust me it is a service which cannot be neglected but by the ungrateful and unthinking. Is there one mo∣ment of your lives that passes unmarked by his blessings? Have you not health, chearfulness, friends, and the most valuable of all blessings, the power to dry the tear of affliction, to comfort the widow, protect the orphan, release the poor debtor, and perform all the good works of peace and mercy?</P>
<P>How should your hearts overflow with gratitude to that God, who thus bountifully spreads around you the means of happiness, do not then my dear children, throw the blessing from you, and con∣tinue squandering your time, and trifling with your health 'till the first is nearly spent, and the latter irretrievably ruined, and you will awaken too late to a just sense of your error, when your mind, evervated by the weakness of your frame, vainly shall endeavour in the few remaining years to regain those sources of mental delight which ever slow from a proper exertion of the reasoning faculties.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="027654_0147_0FD568C8091593A8"/>
When you were with me, was there ever a day too long? I hear you readily answer no. Every moment was fully and pleasantly em∣ployed; true, but had we not always time for reading, writing, music, drawing, needle-work, and every other amusing or useful employment. And did we ever, my dear girls, rise from the sweets of repose, or retire to our chambers at night, without remembering our duty to him through whose mercy alone we enjoyed all those blessings? and certain I am, you were at that time as happy as it was possible for young people to be; you were blithe as the woodlark, bloom∣ing as Hebe, and innocent as the dove, who tries his new fledged wings in little circles round its mother's nest.</P>
<P>Think not, my young friends, that I wish to deprive you of innocent amusement, far from it. In the sphere where it has pleased providence to place you, it is certainly right that you should partake in moderation of all the diversions of the metropolis; but if those diversions are too fre∣quently repeated, they lose their effect, and you return from them weary, disgusted and dis∣satisfied.</P>
<P>But how different are the pleasures arising from the amusement to be found within ourselves. The pursuit of either of the fine arts, the study
<PB N="42" REF="027654_0148_0FD568CBF8E95DD0"/>
of nature, in all her varieties and beauties, the ex∣cellencies of christianity, the delights arising from benevolence—here are inexhaustible sources of entertainment, rational sublime pleasure, that the farther you pursue it, the more enchanting ap∣pears the prospect, new charms arise to your asto∣nished view; and though the joys of youth tran∣siently fleet away, you will still have pleasures within your reach, that can render old age not only easy to yourself, but delightful to others.</P>
<P>I am no stranger to the many enticements youth and inexperience meet with in the gay world to allure them from the paths of reason. I myself spent my youth in London, but it was my lot to be placed in a family, where nothing was deemed pleasure, however specious its ap∣pearance, that was not sanctioned by reason.</P>
<P>Your grandmother, my dear girls, was a wo∣man remarkable for the elogance of her manners and the chearfulness of her disposition; yet be∣lieve me she was as truly pious as a primitive christian. Surrounded with affluence, she was humble, benevolent, tender hearted, and easy of access to the meanest petitioner. In affliction resigned, patient and uncomplaining.</P>
<P>When it was first my happy fate to be taken under her protection, she was scarcely twenty-six
<PB N="43" REF="027654_0149_0FD568CD4A1C12E0"/>
years old, extremely lovely in her person, en∣dowed with every accomplishment, admired wherever she appeared, respected by her friends, and adored by her husband: yet she was not tainted by vanity, but made it her study to con∣ciliate esteem, when love and admiration should be no more. She paid a strict attention to her domestic affairs, attended personally to the mo∣rals and education of her children, never suffer∣ed an hour to pass unemployed, or a day without paying her devotion to her maker.</P>
<P>This is an example I could wish you to fol∣low, as it cannot sail of making you as truly happy, as it is possible for human nature to be.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AND so you really feel yourselves mightily offended because your father thinks of a se∣cond marriage, when you should rather rejoice to find he has chosen so amiable a woman as Mrs. Clairville.</P>
<P>You are to consider that it is more than pro∣bable in a few years you will all of you be settled in a matrimonial way, and then how extremely un∣comfortable will your father find himself, after being so long accustomed to the society of an amiable woman, to feel himself at once deprived of it, how solitary would be his house, how pen∣sive his breakfast hours.</P>
<P>But you cry, you do not like a step-mother. Can you suppose that Mrs. Clairville will assume any improper authority over you when she becomes Lady Winworth?—</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="027654_0151_0FD568D057020F78"/>
Believe me, my children, while you behave with tenderness and propriety towards her, she will never appear otherwise than your friend and companion. Besides, you should reflect that your father having discharged his duty towards you, by giving you a liberal education, and re∣maining unmarried till you have attained to years of maturity, has now an undoubted right to please himself, and chuse a companion suited to his age and disposition.—And shall you, the chil∣dren of his affection, whose happiness he has so much studied, whose felicity is the first wish of his heart, shall you ungratefully murmur at his choice, and by your discontent embitter the life of him it is your duty to love and reverence.</P>
<P>No, no.—I think my dear girls know too well the many obligations they are under to this dear father, to attempt any thing which would be pre∣judicial to his happiness. Consider, my dear girls, how much it will be your interest to endeavour to conciliate the affection and esteem of the wo∣man whom your father thinks proper to place in so respectable a situation. You must regard her as the representative of your deceased parent, and by tender assiduity and attention, make her your sincere friend; such a conduct will make you dearer than ever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the heart of your father, and a delightful tranquillity will diffuse itself through your own bosoms, conscious that to the

<P>Perhaps you may tell me, there is no actual duty due to a step-mother. I confess it is not so much a duty incumbent for you to obey the commands or submit implicitly to the will of any but your natural parent, but remember my fair friends, if you voluntarily perform an exalted action, where perhaps it was not expected, and could not be demanded, how much more will it redound to your honor, than the simple dis∣charge of an obligation.</P>
<P>I am sensible that many young women have been rendered extremely unhappy by their fa∣ther's choosing second wives, but then it has been the error of judgment in his choice; where pas∣sion has so blinded him that he could not discover the faults of the person who had attracted his af∣fection. Perhaps she has been ignorant, ill-na∣tured, illiberal, or fantastic; nay, it has been the unhappy fate of some girls to have for a step-mother, a person in whom all those disagree∣able circumstances are combined. But what a different choice has your father made, Mrs. Clair∣ville is elegant, accomplished, gentle and unas∣suming. She will render your father's evening of life like the parting rays of a mild autumn day, where though we cannot but see the visible
<PB N="47" REF="027654_0153_0FD568D5B91A2230"/>
approach of winter, there is such a soft serenity, such various beauties scattered over the prospect, that the reflecting mind cannot but prefer it to the more gaudy tints that embellish the appearance of spring.</P>
<P>Your own felicity too may be augmented by this union, as I am certain, however vanity or folly may for a moment mislead your understand∣ing, you will all sincerely rejoice in an event that will ultimately tend to insure the most re∣fined pleasure to so good, so valuable a father, as Lord Winworth, by uniting him to a woman, whose highly cultivated understanding renders her at once the chearful rational companion, and the disinterested friend.</P>
<P>You may remember, my dear girls, how un∣kind you thought me, when I positively refused to accompany you to London; perhaps you may now perceive the justice of that refusal. Had I complied with the polite invitation of your fa∣ther, and yielded my own better judgment to your pressing entreaties, I should have undoubt∣edly long ago forfeited, in your opinion, all right to your affection.</P>
<P>Some years before Lord Winworth beheld your truly amiable mother, he so far humbled himself as to make me a tender of his hand and fortune. I
<PB N="48" REF="027654_0154_0FD568D74E31B678"/>
will not dwell on the reason that urged me to re∣fuse an offer so very far above my deserts, least my dear Miss Winworths should think I boasted of my great fortitude and resolution; believe me, it was only an exertion of reason, and I felt amply compensated for all I suffered in this self-denial, (for I will not deny that my heart pleaded strong∣ly in your father's favor) by the reflection that I had acted with honour and propriety, and evinced the sincerity of my gratitude to my dear benefactress.</P>
<P>Affections that have been deeply impressed on our hearts in extreme youth, are often revived again at the remote period of mature age, and I feared to lose the friendship of my young friends, by awakening in the bosom of their father the ten∣derness he once honored me with, by professing—.</P>
<P>Before I drop this subject, I will give you two instances that have fell under my own immediate knowledge, to shew you how very possible it is for an obstinate misjudging child to trifle away both her own and father's happiness, by being wil∣fully blind to the merits of his second wife; and also shew how truly amiable the daughter must appear, who makes the tranquillity of her parent her chief study; and if her own peace is in some measure interrupted by the caprice of a step mo∣ther, she will seek in resignation, piety and hu∣mility, a sweet consolation and comfort.</P>

Celia Markham had the misfortune to lose her mother at the early age of twelve. Mr. Mark∣ham was doatingly fond of his daughter, he placed his chief felicity in the hope of one day seeing her the most amiable, accomplished and happy girl in England.</P>
<P>He had placed her at an eminent boarding school, but he knew too much of the world to suppose, a girl of her volatile disposition, espe∣cially when she was lovely in her person, and reputed heiress to a large fortune, could be so safe any where as under the immediate protec∣tion of a father. He had no female relation whom he could with propriety invite to his house, and he thought he could not do his daugh∣ter a more acceptable service, than by choosing the amiable Miss Nelson to preside in the place of her departed mother.</P>
<P>Miss Nelson was at that time upwards of thirty, she had rendered herself universally beloved and respected by all who knew her, for the innate goodness of her heart was conspicuous in every action. She had received a most liberal education, and her mental endowments were far superior to the generality of what is termed accomplished women—yet so timid and unassuming in her manners, that those with whom she conversed by
<PB N="50" REF="027654_0156_0FD568DA153DBA98"/>
degrees discovered her excellencies, and after some years acquaintance would be daily finding something new to admire. She had by the most exemplary conduct as a daughter, convinced the world what might be expected from her as a wife and mother. She was uniformly humane, pious and gentle; in person attractive, and in manners elegantly simple.</P>
<P>Such was the woman whom Mr. Markham thought would help to form the manners, culti∣vate the understanding, and direct the studies of his darling Celia.</P>
<P>Miss Markham no sooner was informed of her father's intended union, than she conceived the most violent and ill founded dislike toward the innocent object of his affection.</P>
<P>As Celia was so young, Mr. Markham never had an idea of consulting her on his proposed mar∣riage, having therefore obtained from Miss Nel∣son leave to name an early day for the ceremony, he wrote to his daughter an affectionate letter, informing her how much he had studied her hap∣piness in providing her so amiable a friend and preceptress, at the same time requesting her go∣verness to prepare her to be present at the wed∣ding.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="027654_0157_0FD568E1904B10F8"/>
Celia was a girl of high spirits, her under∣standing had remained entirely uncultivated, while large sums had been expended on the far less ne∣cessary superficial accomplishments of music, dan∣cing, drawing, and fancy works. Religion she knew but by name; it is true, there were prayers read twice a-day in the school, and she went with the other ladies regularly to church twice every Sunday, but there it rested. There had been no pains taken to instil into her mind a true knowledge of what religion meant; she had not been taught that to keep her passions under the controul of reason, to submit, without repining, to the will of those whom heaven had placed over her; to be meek, merciful, and just, and let every action of her life be a continued work of gratitude to hea∣ven, and good will to her fellow creatures, was to follow the precepts of true piety.</P>
<P>She had been early taught to value herself, upon the trifling advantages of birth and fortune, for she saw the visible difference between the at∣tention and respect paid by her governess and the teachers to herself and those young ladies who had neither of those advantages to recommend them.</P>
<P>She was naturally vain, and that vanity was augmented by the constant adulation which she daily received from those girls, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="52" REF="027654_0158_0FD568DB89BB12D8"/>
of spirit induced them to cringe to her superior wealth.</P>
<P>From constantly contemplating those fancied endowments, she began to imagine she was born for universal sway, had settled it in her own mind, that in a few years she should be called home to preside at her father's table, have the manage∣ment of the family, and partake of all the fa∣shionable pleasures with which the metropolis abounds.</P>
<P>How great then was her disappointment when she found all these pleasing expectations at once frustrated—when she found she was to be still con∣sidered as a child, and under the controul of the most dreaded of all characters, a step-mother.—</P>
<P>She knew Miss Nelson, but far from admiring her amiable qualities, she had considered her as a dull, precise, insipid old maid. She had no idea that chearfulness and unaffected piety constantly in∣habited the same breast, nor could she conceive that rational conversation, study, useful employ∣ment, and innocent amusement, could amply di∣versify the scene, and be a source of tranquil hap∣piness without the aid of public entertainments, dress, parade and folly.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="027654_0159_0FD568E341487208"/>
It may be easily conceived, that two tempers so diametrically opposite would never agree.</P>
<P>Mr. Markham had seen these erroneous traits in his daughter's disposition, but he flattered himself, the amiable example and condescend∣ing behaviour of Miss Nelson would so far ope∣rate on her temper, as to make her love and en∣deavour to imitate her virtues.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe the rage and grief that displayed itself in the countenance of Celia, on the receipt of her father's letters, regarding only what she foolishly imagined would be preju∣dicial to her own happiness. She gave vent to her passion in the most unbecoming terms, called her father cruel, unjust and unfeeling, and vowed she would die sooner than call Miss Nelson mother. "I will go to the wedding, said she, because that woman shall not have a moment's happiness of which it is in my power to deprive her."</P>
<P>With this <HI>laudable</HI> resolution she sat forward for her father's house, where upon being tenderly embraced by him, instead of returning a cordial salute, and wishing him joy, she turned her face from him and bursting into tears, (which pro∣ceeded more from passion than sensibility) said she was sorry to find her dear mother was so soon forgot.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="027654_0160_0FD568DE016EED98"/>
Not forgot, my beloved; replied Mr. Mark∣ham, for I have sought a woman who is her coun∣ter-part in every amiable quality.</P>
<P>They then proceeded to church, where, after the ceremony was performed, tears and sullen curt∣seys were all the gratulations Celia offered to her new mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Markham was naturally a woman of great sensibility she attributed Celia's melancholy to a cause that did honour to her own heart, and in∣stead of taking offence, endeavoured to soothe and entertain her during the whole day. But alas! the gentle Mrs. Markham knew not the difficulty of the task she had undertaken. She had known Celia some years before her mother's death, and always thought her an a∣miable, lively girl, and judging of her dispo∣sition by that of her parents, imagined there would be no difficulty in modelling her accord∣ing to her own wishes.</P>
<P>But these fallacious hopes were soon no more. Celia from the day of her father's marriage took every opportunity in her power to thwart and vex her mother-in-law.</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Markham was a woman of too much sense, to let the caprice of such a girl ruffle
<PB N="55" REF="027654_0161_0FD568E61847F140"/>
the uncommon serenity of her temper, yet was it totally impossible for a woman of her exqui∣site sensibility, to enjoy any tolerable degree of happiness while she saw the darling child of the man she loved and esteemed of so froward and perverse a disposition.</P>
<P>Celia was volatile, and thoughtless to excess, fond of company, and so entirely unqualified to amuse or entertain herself, that the most improper society was preferred to being alone. Her mo∣ther-in-law was of too grave and rational a turn to afford her any pleasure by her conversation, and to read or work required so much attention, that she termed it fatigue.</P>
<P>It was with infinite regret that Mr. Markham discovered the little felicity he was like to enjoy in this second union. He saw the child of his tenderest affection restless and discontented; he saw with anguish the many fruitless endeavours of Mrs. Markham to reclaim and make her pursue the direct road to happiness.</P>
<P>Whenever the tender attention of this amiable woman lead her to remonstrate with Celia on the impropriety of her conduct, and the miserable waste of her time, the petulant girl would burst into tears, and cry, "Oh! that my dear mother was living, I should not then be treated thus cru∣elly,
<PB N="56" REF="027654_0162_0FD568E08369D720"/>
and abridged of every innocent pleasure, by a woman, who having stolen from me my dear father's affections, now usurps and undue authority over both him and me."</P>
<P>These continual disputes greatly embittered Mrs. Markham's life.—Mr. Markham was at a loss how to conduct himself so as to give pain to neither wife or daughter. In short, the whole family was unhappy from the capricious beha∣viour of her, whose chief study should have been to promote their felicity.</P>
<P>Celia had her friends, her parties, and her secrets, in which Mrs. Markham was not allowed to participate; the consequence was, that she at a very early age had her lovers also.</P>
<P>Among the many candidates for her favor was a Captain Parslow, he was a man of no fortune, ignorant, conceited, and a complete coxcomb. He soon discovered the weakness of Celia, he flattered her foibles, took her part against her mo∣ther-in-law, and, in short, so far won on the foolish thoughtless girl, that she consented to elope with him, and take a trip to Scotland.</P>
<P>By the dropping of a letter Mrs. Markham discovered the plan; she talked to Celia in the accents of friendship and send solicitude but re∣ceived
<PB N="57" REF="027654_0163_0FD568EA7492B998"/>
in return, only impertinence and disre∣spect.</P>
<P>Mrs. Markham thought it her duty to acquaint her husband with the discovery she had made. Grieved to the soul, he sent for his daughter, and in the most pathetic terms entreated her to desist from so fatal a step.</P>
<P>The artful Celia thought this was the time to alienate her father's affections from his wife—she positively denied the whole charge, and declared she believed it must be a contrivance of Mrs. Markham';; begged if her dear father thought her capable of such imprudence, he would send her abroad, and shut her in a convent. "I know, continued she, with well dissembled tears, that you have been taught to consider your poor girl as an abandoned wretch, who consulted only her own happiness, but indeed, indeed my be∣loved father, you have been deceived. I am not the guilty creature you think me. But, alas! I have long seen my presence is a bar to your hap∣piness, send me from you, then, dear Sir; since it is impossible we can both enjoy content, let me be the victim, and may your felicity be un∣bounded."</P>
<P>This artful speech had the desired effect, and Mr. Markham believing his daughter perfectly
<PB N="58" REF="027654_0164_0FD568EC21230840"/>
innocent, began to treat the woman with coolness whom he imagined had attempted to create dis∣sention between him and his only child.</P>
<P>Celia saw she had now completely made her mother-in-law unhappy, and exulted in her cru∣elty, adding insult to the already poignant suffer∣ings of the patient and amiable Mrs. Markham.</P>
<P>But Celia had not sufficient art to elude or evade the solicitude of her admirer. Parslow still continued his devoirs, and Miss Markham listened to his flattery and received his assiduities with too much pleasure to give any room for despair; in a short time she eloped. Her father was amazed, and how much was his astonishment increased when the following letter was put into his hand.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR AND HONORED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH the step I have taken will. I am certain, by the generality of mankind, be called an improper one, my own heart acquits me of any motive but a wish to insure your hap∣piness.</P>
<P>I have long seen, with sincere anguish of heart, how much my presence militated against your

tranquillity. I am convinced, my dear father, Mrs. Markham is now the only object of your affection; your once tenderly beloved child has only a secondary place in your heart.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my revered parent, if I say, this was too evident not to be discovered, and when once, discovered, too painful to be borne in silence.</P>
<P>The contempt which Mrs. Markham's unjust suspicions subject me to, not only from our ac∣quaintance, but even our servants, has urged me to make choice of a protector for my fame and honor, nor do I scruple to add, a protector from her undeserved malice and continual ill-nature.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear father, may you be as happy as I wish you; forgive and think with compassion on your child,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The feelings of a father on the receipt of such a letter are more easily conceived than described. He had long considered his innocent wife as a person who bad disturbed the peace of his family, and now that he imagined himself convinced of her unjust conduct towards his daughter, his dis∣pleasure knew no bounds; rage, invective, and bitter reproach, were all the gentle, meek, un∣complaining sufferer received from a husband
<PB N="60" REF="027654_0166_0FD568F27B192298"/>
who once fondly esteemed her. But though Mrs. Markham complained not the distress of her mind preyed upon her delicate frame, she sank under this unexpected misfortune, and a rapid decline in a few months put a period to her exist∣ence.</P>
<P>In the mean time Celia and her husband had been received and forgiven by Mr. Markham; but, alas! that too indulgent father soon disco∣vered, that in the loss of his wife, he had been bereft of every earthly comfort; his daughter ra∣ther triumphed in, than endeavoured to soothe his melancholy—she threw out the most illiberal censures on the memory of the deceased Mrs. Markham, and having no longer any particular end to attain by pretending violent affection to her father, she at first began to flight and at length totally neglected him.</P>
<P>He felt, acutely felt, her unkindness, but still his affection led him to lavish immense sums to support the extravagance of herself and husband 'till unable any longer to keep them from ruin, he gave up all but about one hundred pounds a year, with which he retired into the country, and ended his days in what he called <HI>peaceful obscurity.</HI></P>
<P>And to the last his prayers were offered at the throne of grace for his ungrateful child—but alas!
<PB N="61" REF="027654_0167_0FD568F46B477F90"/>
Celia, by her own conduct counteracted the effects of those pious prayers. Neglected, nay despised, by her husband, she launched into every species of dissipation, and was in a few years reduced to a state of absolute penury, where remorse is not the least painful of her many heavy afflictions, all which she has brought on herself by an illiberal obstinate conduct; for had she rightly considered the virtues and amiable deportment of Mrs. Markham, she might have contributed to the felicity of her fa∣ther, and, in the end, ultimately insured her own.</P>
<P>How different was the behaviour of Serena—But as my letter is already of a considerable length, I shall reserve her story 'till the next post.</P>
<P>Adieu, my beloved pupils, once more believe me, to be completely happy yourselves, you must study the happiness of all with whom you are con∣nected; for there is more real pleasure flows from the reflection of having promoted the welfare and tranquillity of a fellow creature, than can proceed from the highest self gratifications the world can afford. The one is like a transient vapour that for a moment illumines the sky, passes and is for∣gotten; but the other, like the glorious sun, glads the whole face of nature, by its enlivening beams, through the day, and even lends its rays to the silver moon, to chear the horrors of approaching

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE taken up my pen, without farther preface to proceed on my promised story, and shall leave my dear Miss Winworths to apply the moral themselves; sensible that they do not went sense to discover right from wrong, and sincerely hoping they will not let folly, vanity, or illiberal prejudices mislead their judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. Osborne was left a widower at a very early age, with only one daughter, named Serena, who, when she had the misfortune to lose her mother, was scarcely three years old. She inhe∣rited by the death of her mother, a genteel inde∣pendence, and was reputed heiress to her father's fortune, which was not inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Not long after this melancholy event Mr. Os∣bore, being on a visit to a friend in the country, became acquainted with Miss Withers.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="027654_0170_0FD568FAD1550300"/>
She was, it must be confessed, beautiful in the extreme, but that acknowledged, and there was not another favorable circumstance to be men∣tioned in her behalf. She was the daughter of a man who enjoyed in a country town, a consider∣able and lucrative post under government; his wife had brought him four or five thousand pounds, which had been accumulated by her father, who regarded not the cries of the fatherless, or the tears of the widow.</P>
<P>This woman's education had been such as might be expected for the child of a poor petty-fogging lawyer, who by dint of chicanery and dirty em∣ployment, was scraping a little sordid dross to∣gether, and thought by leaving her a fortune, he left her every necessary recommendation to secure her advancement in life; the consequence was, that to the most illiberal contracted ideas and con∣summate ignorance, she added the pride and self conceit of a first-rate woman of fashion; she was extravagantly fond of dress, parade, and show; but had no idea of any difference being necessary between the education of a gentlewoman, and that of a tradesman's or farmer's daughter.</P>
<P>Brought up under such a mother, with such confined notions, Miss Withers had been táught to believe that the good housewife and accom∣plished
<PB N="65" REF="027654_0171_0FD568FC92B97CD0"/>
woman, were one and the same thing. She perfectly understood the art of cookery, pick∣ling preserving, and all the long &amp;c's. necessary to form a complete house-keeper.</P>
<P>She could work tent-stitch, tambour, and cross∣stitch, make all her father's, and indeed, all the family linen, knew the cheapest ways of going to market, how to scold and keep her servants in order; in short, had been brought up as a com∣plete <HI>Mrs. Notable.</HI></P>
<P>But to the fine arts she was a perfect stranger. Music, dancing, or drawing, had no charms for her, nor had she the least idea of the pleasures resulting from a well informed, elegantly culti∣vated mind. Haughty, yet mean; ignorant, yet obstinate in her opinion, however absurd, and deaf to the voice of conviction.</P>
<P>She had been educated in the strictest principles of methodism, yet was she of no fixed religion, having been wearied in her youth by being too rigidly obliged to conform to her parents man∣ners; she contracted a dislike to her religious du∣ties, and at the time Mr. Osborne first saw her, was of no particular sect whatever.</P>
<P>She had, by the death of her mother, who had
<PB N="66" REF="027654_0172_0FD568FE09686AB0"/>
been extremely anxious to make her dear Jemima a fortune, just come to the possession of ten thou∣sand pounds, and was so insinuating in her man∣ner, that she was universally well received in all companies, and called one of the best kind of girls in the world.</P>
<P>Mr. Osborne was captivated with her lovely person and specious manners, and having made proposals to her guardians, was accepted, and the lady, in due time, became Mrs. Osborne.</P>
<P>She had from the first of her acquaintance pre∣tended a violent attachment to the little Serena, I say pretended, because I have been since con∣vinced she regarded her with an eye of envy and ill-nature from the moment she became her mo∣ther-in-law.</P>
<P>In about twelve months Mrs. Osborne pre∣sented her husband with a little girl, and solemnly declared, at the time of her birth, it was im∣possible for her to love any child better than she did Serena; and that it should be her chief study to make no difference between the chil∣dren.</P>
<P>This was a declaration I, who was present, was by no means pleased with, as I knew it was
<PB N="67" REF="027654_0173_0FD569030D785188"/>
not in nature for a woman to love another child so well as her own offspring—and though a strong sense of duty, and a naturally compassion∣ate heart, might lead a woman to treat with the utmost tenderness, a girl, deprived of her natu∣ral parent, and thrown, as it were, on her pro∣tection; yet it was impossible but inclination must lead her to give the preference to her own child.</P>
<P>As Serena and Jemima (the name of her little half-sister) grew up, light and shade could not be more opposite than their dispositions. Serena was sensible, volatile, and chearful, of a bright genius, fond of the pursuit of knowledge, yet meek, mild and innocent as it was possible for a human being to be.</P>
<P>Jemima was sullen, proud, obstinate, and so stupid, that it was not in the power of any masters whatever to cultivate a mind rendered impene∣trable by nature.</P>
<P>The excellencies which discovered themselves in the mind and disposition of Serena were so many faults in the eyes of Mrs. Osborne, nor did she fail to aggravate every error to which her vo∣latility, or thoughtless innocence might betray her, into crimes, so that by degrees her father's affection
<PB N="68" REF="027654_0174_0FD569072A7C8A88"/>
became alienated from her, and it was almost impossible for the poor girl to speak, move, or look so as not to give offence. As she advanced towards womanhood, her troubles increased—her high sense of her religious duties was termed hy∣pocrisy—her strong sensibility, art; and her fine taste, and brilliant genius, follies, which would in the end lead her to ruin.</P>
<P>When she had attained the age of sixteen, the bequest of a large fortune obliged her father to visit Jamaica; he resolved to take his family with him, and had not been there long before Mrs. Osborne was seized with one of those fevers inci∣dent to the climate.</P>
<P>Tenderly and with the utmost care did Serena watch over her for many months when the disor∣der had left her in a weak emaciated state, did she never quit her bed-side, administering every medicine, nor ever taking rest except what she procured at intervals on a matrass in the same a∣partment. And what was the return she received? Pettishness discontent, and repining. Frequently did Mrs. Osborne ask, if she was brought to that strange place to be murdered—if it was intended she should be poisoned—and whether Serena did not know that the doctor designed to kill her; and these expressions were not the effect of de∣lirium,
<PB N="69" REF="027654_0175_0FD569040CA6CCD0"/>
but spoken with a coolness and asperity that tore the heart of the mild affectionate girl to whom they were addressed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborne at length recovered, when it pleased heaven to take her husband from her, and she was left involved in a disagreeable law suit, which was finally terminated to her disadvantage, she was cast with costs of suit, and returned to England with little more than five hundred pounds remaining.</P>
<P>Now it was that Serena shewed herself to be the amiable girl I had ever thought her.</P>
<P>When she received her fortune, she settled an handsome annuity on Mrs. Osborne, and divided the residue between Jemima and herself; though at her father's death she had been, by their arts, deprived of any advantage from his fortune, the whole being by will left to Mrs. Osborne and her daughter, but providence had ordained that they were not to enjoy it.</P>
<P>To the last hour that she remained with her mother-in-law, she studied her happiness only, though I have been informed it was seldom in∣deed that she received even the smallest token of approbation. Her society was circumscribed, her
<PB N="70" REF="027654_0176_0FD569058B4BCCC8"/>
amusements abridged, her most innocent actions censured, and the gaiety of her heart construed into levity, and reprimanded at vice; nay, after the alteration in their circumstances, she was suf∣fered to perform the most menial offices: in short, my dear girls, her education had been confined, her genius cramped, and had she not been a girl of an uncommon good heart, her disposition must have been totally perverted by the constant re∣straint she lived under and the severity with which she was treated; while Jemima was indulged in idleness, her fault glossed over, and her perverse haughty disposition called laudable pride. Yet did I never hear that Serena ever used an unbe∣coming expression to her mother, or made any complaint of unkindness.</P>
<P>She has been now for some years married to a deserving man, and still continues to treat Mrs. Osborne with the highest respect, and her daugh∣ter with affection, though the ingratitude of Je∣mima often appears, by her unkind neglect of a sister who sacrificed her own interest to the in∣terest and happiness of her mother.</P>
<P>Serena, though happy in her matrimonial con∣nection, is not in affluent circumstances.</P>
<P>Jemima is lately married to a man of large for∣tune, and removed to a distant part of England,
<PB N="71" REF="027654_0177_0FD5690A40169540"/>
where, she can seldom find time to write to her sister, and when she does so far condescend, it is with such apparent carelessness, coldness, and distance, that the warm heart of Serena is chilled by the perusal of her letters; yet will I venture to affirm Serena the happier woman of the two.</P>
<P>I happened to mention one day the unmerited treatment she had received, not only from them, but from her other relations; and mark, my dear girls, the answer I received.</P>
<P>"Were I to say their unkindness did not give me pain, I should be guilty of falsehood, because I have that warm affection in my heart, which expands it with brotherly love towards all my fel∣low creatures, and never yet breathed a wish to the disadvantage of a single individual. I mourn their afflictions, and rejoice in their prosperity. I am therefore, conscious of not deserving their unkindness, and wrapt in the integrity of my own heart, from my soul pity the bosom that can har∣bour malice or ill will towards any one."</P>

<P>N. B. Soon after this last letter Lord Winworth was married to Mrs. Clairville, and the young ladies conducting themselves accord∣ing to the advice of their amiable friend, Mentoria, found in the new∣made Lady Winworth, every engaging quality that could be desired, to form the polite agreeable companion, the affectionate parent, and sincere friend. The correspondence between Mentoria and her pu∣pils was continued for many years, but as the publication of the whole would render this work too extensive, besides occasion unne∣cessary repetitions. I have selected only two more letters, with which I shall close the present collection; one addressed to Miss Gertrude, on her marriage, and a second to the same lady, on the birth of a daughter, written by her venerable friend, when she was in the last stage of a decline, and hastily verging towards her place of rest, to which she humbly looked forward with that sweet confidence and hea∣venly hope which ever elevates the soul of a departing Christian.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. MENTORIA TO MISS G. WINWORTH.</HEAD>
<P>I ADDRESS myself singly to you, my dear Gertrude, because the delicacy of your pre∣sent situation demands my serious attention, and calls up all my tenderness.</P>
<P>I am inexpressibly pleased to find you have made choice of so worthy a man as Sir Arthur Fitzgerald, and that your father approves the ob∣ject of your selection</P>
<P>I think you have acted like a woman of sense and prudence, and I make no doubt but you will preserve the same propriety of conduct when a wife, as has evidently characterised you while single.</P>
<P>I admire that real delicacy which impelled you to give an immediate dismission to all those pre∣tenders who solicited your hand without being able to influence your heart in their favor. There
<PB N="74" REF="027654_0180_0FD5690F68E24730"/>
cannot be a more despicable passion than that in∣satiable thirst for admiration, which leads a wo∣man to encourage indiscriminately the forward advances of every coxcomb, who shall pay them the incense of flattery, and be continually spread∣ing their lures to attract adulation, however in their hearts they may despise the person who of∣fers it.</P>
<P>I am sensible, my dear Gertrude will pardon me, if anxious for her future happiness, I venture to give her my advice and opinion for the preserva∣tion of her felicity in the married state; it has often been remarked, that a heart is much easier gained than kept, and, believe me, it is a very judicious observation.</P>
<P>There requires more care, attention, and soli∣citude, from the wife to the husband, than from the mistress to her adoring lover. The lover be∣ing but seldom with you, sees you only in part, it is natural to suppose you would neither appear before him in a slatternly dress, or with a peevish aspect. Your clothes will be always put on with neatness, and your face dressed in smiles. On the contrary, the husband being always in your company, has an opportunity of discovering every little defect or blemish in your person, manners, or disposition, and the chief study of a wife should
<PB N="75" REF="027654_0181_0FD56910C9779968"/>
be to guard against every thing that might create distaste, or excite disgust.</P>
<P>And in the first place let me recommend a most scrupulous regard to delicacy and neatness.</P>
<P>Many young women foolishly imagine, as soon as they are married, they have a right to under∣stand and laugh at an indelicate allusion, but from this fault, the native purity of your mind will, I am certain, preserve you, since nothing but ex∣treme ignorance or levity could lead any woman to listen with apparent pleasure, to an improper tale, or ill timed jest.</P>
<P>There are too many men, nay, even among those who call themselves gentlemen, who will not scruple to shock a woman's ears with conver∣sation of this kind; but the look of marked disap∣probation and silent contempt, will never fail to silence them, unless they are either brutes or fools, and to such there is no fear of your being exposed.</P>
<P>The next thing is neatness in your person and dress and an equanimity of temper to be pre∣served towards your husband, and your servants;—nothing degrades a gentlewoman more than her suffering her temper to be so far ruffled as to use improper language to her dependants, nor can
<PB N="76" REF="027654_0182_0FD56914CA6B6F48"/>
any thing be more disgusting to a man of sense than to see his wife give way to sudden starts of passion.</P>
<P>To every relation and friend of your husband, shew a polite attention and marked preference; shew him, that to be related to, or esteemed by him, is a sufficient claim upon your regard—whatever be his errors, confine the knowledge of them to your own bosom, and endeavour, by the midest persuasions, to lead him to the path of rectitude. Discretion must direct you as to the proper season to offer your advice and opinions, since men in general are so tenacious of their pre∣rogative, that they start from every thing that has the least appearance of controul or opposi∣tion. Never atttempt to restrain his pleasures; if he should be fond of company, dissipation and expensive amusements, be it your study to de∣tach his mind from those pursuits, by endeavour∣ing to render his home delightful, let your face be ever arrayed in smiles at his approach, form a so∣ciety of those he loves and esteems most, exert your various abilities to charm and entertain him, and believe me, he who constantly meets chear∣fulness and smiles at home, will seldom wish to seek abroad for pleasure.</P>
<P>Above all things never suffer any person to speak disrespectfully of him in your presence, and
<PB N="77" REF="027654_0183_0FD569168CB50958"/>
guard your heart from the least approach of jea∣lousy; should there even be occasion for suspi∣cion, be careful not to let him see you have dis∣covered his dishonorable conduct, and never suf∣fer any one, more especially a <HI>man,</HI> to hear you complain.</P>
<P>Avoid reproaches, they in general increase ra∣ther than alleviate the distress; if patient suffer∣ing and the mild remonstrance of an afflicted un∣complaining spirit, will not work a reformation, reproach and discontent will have no effect.</P>
<P>You must not be above attending to his interest so far as may lead you to inspect the expences of your family; have stated and regular times for examining your house-keeper's accounts, and be∣ing satisfied that your trades-people are regularly paid, and do not let trifles put you aside from this very necessary point.</P>
<P>Let your own expences be regulated by pru∣dence void of parsimony, and suffer not a passion for finery, and a wish to eclipse your acquaint∣ance, prompt you to overstep your income, or deprive you of the inexpressible pleasure of re∣lieving indigent merit.</P>
<P>Though I would not have you sacrifice too largely at the shrine of that idol, fashion, I would
<PB N="78" REF="027654_0184_0FD5691793ADEEF0"/>
have you follow her so far as may make your ap∣pearance alway deserve the appellation of ele∣gantly neat; nor must you confine this appear∣ance only to your going abroad or receiving com∣pany at home; though you were to be in the country for months, and see none but your hus∣band and servants, never neglect the real neces∣sary duties of the toilet, it is a respect due to him, it shews a wish to appear agreeable in his eyes, and that you prefer his approbation to that of all the world beside.</P>
<P>There is one more circumstance I must men∣tion, although a thorough knowledge of your dis∣position renders it almost unnecessary; yet I have seen so many couples made inexpressibly miser∣able by it, that I cannot resist my inclination to warn you of so dangerous a conduct.</P>
<P>Never permit any man, however clothed with the mask of friendship, to treat you with fami∣liarity. There are many freedoms, which to a girl may be perfectly innocent, and yet become almost crimes when offered to, or received by a married woman.</P>
<P>A married woman should never suffer a man to entertain her in a strain of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>antry, a pressure of the hand is an affront, and an attempt at a sa∣lute (except where the nearness of the relation
<PB N="79" REF="027654_0185_0FD5691919616BD8"/>
authorises such a liberty) is, and should be resented as an insult.</P>
<P>There is a decent gravity of manner that will at once excite admiration and respect, and yet ex∣clude all improper familiarity, nor can any thing be more ridiculous, than to see the mistress of a fa∣mily, perhaps the mother of four or five children, affecting a giddy flirting carriage, that would be hardly excusable in a girl of sixteen—it may, in some instances, proceed from an innocent gaiety of heart, but it hardly ever fails of degenerating into levity and imprudence, always lays a woman open to insult, of which she cannot complain, because she evidently invited it; and too often ends in the total loss of honor, happiness, and repu∣tation. Be chearful, condescending, and polite to all, but let there ever be that dignity in your manner which may keep <HI>impertinent fools,</HI> or <HI>de∣signing villains</HI> at a proper distance.</P>
<P>Pardon the length of this epistle, and believe it proceeds from a friend who loves you. Re∣member me affectionately to your dear sisters.—Adieu, may every blessing be your portion here and hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. MENTORIA TO LADY FITZGERALD.</HEAD>
<P>THE news that you were safe in bed, and mo∣ther to a daughter, my dear Gertrude, will, believe me, give as much satisfaction to my heart, as any sublunary pleasure possibly can; and, weak as I am, tottering as it were on the very brink of a vast eternity, I cannot resist the desire I feel, of once more writing to my beloved pupils, for in addressing Lady Fitzgerald, I suppose my∣self also writing to her sisters.</P>
<P>But first a few words to yourself, in regard to this dear, this precious little charge, with which it has pleased heaven to entrust you. May it ever be impressed on your mind that the future hap∣piness or misery of this child depends greatly on the treatment she receives during her puerile years.</P>
<P>Let not a too great fondness prompt you, by extreme indulgence, to enervate the faculties of
<PB N="81" REF="027654_0187_0FD5691CF0C248D8"/>
her soul, or pervert her disposition, and by so doing render her totally unfit to bear the many inconveniences and crosses she must necessarily meet with in her passage through life.</P>
<P>And on the contrary, do not, by an ill-judged severity, drive her to mean subterfuges, falshoods and deceit, through fear of your anger.—Many an amiable girl has been totally ruined by such treatment; it leads them to fear but not love their parents, it prompts them to make companions of their servants, and often ends in the entire per∣version of their principles.</P>
<P>Teach her to fear to disoblige you, but let it be through fear of losing your affection, not from the apprehension of punishment. Do not be too anxious to have your child praised for an early progress in her education; a young mind should not be loaded, it spoils the memory, and often occasions a dislike to study in more advanced life, besides, children accustomed to hear themselves commended are apt to think themselves sufficient∣ly wife and accomplished before their education is well begun.</P>
<P>Do not encourage her in a love of finery, or suffer her to be told she is handsome, they will both be very pernicious to her future tranquil∣lity.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="027654_0188_0FD5691E5FAFDCB8"/>
There is one thing which parents are very apt, not only to do themselves, but to suffer their ser∣vants to do the same; that is, when any little master visits at the house nearly of miss's age, she is told that he is her little husband, and that she must hold up her head and behave like a woman, or she will never be married,</P>
<P>Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced into ther little hearts, before they are capable of understanding what the word means.</P>
<P>This is, to me, the most foolish conduct in the world, and nothing would offend me so soon, as having such ridiculous things said to any child in whose education and future prospects I was any ways concerned. Teach them the difference be∣tween right and wrong, and convince their rea∣son, by pointing out the real way to promote their own happiness, and merit the regard and esteem of their friends.</P>
<P>Do not introduce your girl too early into pub∣lic, it will give her a taste for dissipation: in proper time let her partake in moderation of all the amusements of the metropolis, so as to pre∣vent the bad effects of curiosity ungratified; but at the same time accustom her to find resources within herself, that may, at all times, enable her to banish that monster <HI>Ennui.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="027654_0189_0FD5691FD3D7F4C0"/>
Trust not the cultivation of her mental fa∣culties, or the forming of her moral character, to any one but yourself; and as she advances towards womanhood make her your friend and compa∣nion: let the distance between mother and daugh∣ter be forgot, and by treating her with a degree of confidence that flatters her self-consequence, encourage her to make your bosom the repository of all her secrets, and be ready to apply to your better jugment to direct all her actions.</P>
<P>I am certain there would not be half the impru∣dencies committed by girls in general, if they were not kept at such an awful distance by their mo∣thers; that fearing either ridicule or reproof, they dare not entrust them with their little plans and disappointments, and relying either on the ad∣vice of some one as inexperienced as themselves, or to the suggestions of their own simple hearts, they involve themselves in troubles, which en∣danger their peace of mind and ruin their reputa∣tion, but so it will ever be while mothers forget they have ever been girls themselves, and make no allowance for the volatility of youth, and the innocent impulses of a heart unburthened by the cares of the world.</P>
<P>I have written much more than I intended, but the subject interested me, and there is yet another which dwells still nearer my heart, that is, my
<PB N="84" REF="027654_0190_0FD5692480C29868"/>
beloved Gertrude, the necessity there is of giving your child a proper sense of the high advantages of early piety, but this must not be done by teach∣ing her to say long prayers, of which she cannot comprehend the meaning, or by making her read books of dull theology.</P>
<P>It is example, my dear friend, must teach her the true principles of the Christian Religion; let her see you in the act of devotion, let her curio∣sity be awakened, and then, as you answer her questions lead her by degrees to love, worship and adore the Almighty giver of all good; convince her of her dependence on his bounty for food, raiment, and all the blessings of life; teach her to place her whole confidence in his mercy, to re∣ceive even the smallest blessing with gratitude, and to bow under the heaviest affliction with patience and humility.</P>
<P>But above all things, mind that your example does not contradict you precept. What confidence can a child place in the religion of its parent, when the parent lives in direct opposition to the principles of that religion.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear friend, this is the one thing needful! this the heavenly comforter, that sup∣ports us through life, and will cheer us in the hour of death!</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="027654_0191_0FD569274910CD00"/>
Our duty is plainly marked and so easy, that when we do not perform it, we take more pains to court misery, than would suffice to make us truly happy. What can be more easily com∣prehended even by the meanest understanding. <HI>"Do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly."</HI> <Q><HI>Love thy Creator above all things, and thy neigh∣bour as thyself! forgive as you hope to be forgiv∣en.</HI></Q> And remember, <HI>"That with the same mea∣sure you mete, the like shall be given to you again."</HI></P>
<P>My dear young friends, think me not too seri∣ous. I am old, and sinking to the grave, I am convinced of the necessity of living well, if we hope to die in peace; and solicitous for the wel∣fare of all dear to the family of Winworth. I have exerted myself to write this, which you may consider as my last farewell.</P>
<P>God preserve and bless you all, may peace reign in your hearts, and true piety direct your actions; may you so pass through this transitory life, as not to dread the approach of the messenger that shall convey you to eternal rest.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is much to be lamented, that in the present mode of educating females, the useful is entire∣ly neglected, for the more ornamental and super∣ficial accomplishments.</P>
<P>There was a time, when, if the daughter of a reputable tradesman could read and write good English, handle her needle with neatness and celerity, and understand both the theory and practice of good housewifery, she was thought perfectly accomplished, and so indeed she was as those qalifications rendered her capable of un∣dertaking the management of a family.</P>
<P>But in the present refined age, if an industrious tradesman can afford to give his daughter, five hundred pounds, it is immediately settled by Mamma, that Miss must be <HI>genteelly</HI> educated</P>
<P>Accordingly she is at an early age sent to a boar∣ding-school, where she learns to jabber bad French, and worse English; the old-fashion sam∣pler, and useful plain-work are neglected, and she is instructed how to work fillagree, make
<PB N="87" REF="027654_0193_0FD5692B3A6DF648"/>
wafer work, daub sattin, and work ill proportioned figures in cloth, which in due time are curiously mounted, and hung round to ornament the par∣lour of the fond but ill judging parents.</P>
<P>Add to these accomplishments the very fashion∣able one of jingling the keys of the harpsichord, with great velocity, though perhaps out of time and out of tune.</P>
<P>Imagine Miss just returned, at the age of seven∣teen, her mind puffed up with vanity, and her head well stored with sensibility, and all the delicate feelings to be gleaned from a circulating library, the contents of which she has eagerly and indiscriminately perused, without any one taking the pains to direct her judgment or correct her taste.</P>
<P>We will suppose her lovely in her person, and attractive in her manners, she comes home, and is idolized by her too partial mother, and spoken of by her father with pride and exultation; but alas! she is too fine a lady to pay any attention to the domestic concerns of the family.</P>
<P>In this foolish idea she is indulged by the mo∣ther, who thinks her dear girl's beauty, sensibi∣lity, and accomplishments, will undoubtedly ob∣tain her a match far superior to her present station,
<PB N="88" REF="027654_0194_0FD5692DAE4E3B98"/>
and she will have no occasion to be a good house∣wife.</P>
<P>But these sanguine wishes are seldom if ever realized, and we will suppose her married to a man who is just entered into a genteel and impro∣ving line of business; her friends think it a good match, her fortune is an acquisition to her husband and they enter the career of life with all the hopes of permanent happiness which peace plenty can inspire.</P>
<P>But what a wretched figure does this elegant accomplished girl make, as mistress of a family; her servants cheat and laugh at her, her acquaint∣ance blame her, and perhaps she may incur even the censure of her husband, for paying no more attention to matters which so nearly concern his interest.</P>
<P>Has she children, she knows not how to make or mend their clothes, she is always surrounded with difficulties, from which she knows not how to extricate herself, and ashamed to confess her ignorance to any one who could instruct her in the point she requires, she becomes peevish and dis∣satisfied, neglects even those accomplishments which she formerly strove so hard to attain; be∣comes negligent in her dress, careless in her man∣ners, and sinks into a very blank in the crea∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="027654_0195_0FD5244A371BA698"/>
Her husband disappointed in not seeing that order and regularity at home which he had once fondly hoped, no longer finds any charms in her society, and seeks to forget his disappointment either in the bottle, or at the gaming table, both equally destructive; and she fees inevitable ruin approaching, without the smallest power to ward off the blow.</P>
<P>Nor can the whole universe present us with an object more truly deserving our pity, than such a woman in a state of penury! She is at a loss how to perform even the necessary duties of life, she cannot exert herself to obtain even a single meal for herself or children; she pines in ob∣scurity, regretting her useless education, and wish∣es that the sums so expended, had been laid by to encrease her fortune, and she herself had been only instructed in those things, which would have tended ultimately to render her a useful and re∣spectable member of society.</P>
<P>But how widely different is the lot of the happy girl, whose parents have, not only by precept but example, implanted in her mind the great necessity of rendering herself useful, before she can be esteemed valuable—who perfectly un∣derstands how to manage her family, and regu∣late her servants—who to affability and chearful∣ness, and industry, oeconomy and piety.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="027654_0196_0FD5693050208E28"/>
Such a woman when she marries, however small her fortune, brings to her husband an inex∣haustible fund of treasure. She is not ashamed to investigate even the minutest concerns of her fa∣mily; her expences are regulated by the strictest rules of frugality void of parsimony, with one hand she secures her husband's interest, and with the other dispenses to the sons and daughters of poverty, the overplus of those blessings which her own prudence has helped to secure to herself.</P>
<P>She is always strictly neat in her apparel, but entirely free from shew or finery; her whole family is regular, uniform and decent, her ser∣vants respect her, her husband idolizes her, and her children look up to her as their friend and benefactress, from whose bright example they may learn the road to happiness.</P>
<P>Should even misfortune overtake her, she is still chearful, still unembarrassed, without a murmur she condescends to perform even the meanest offi∣ces for herself, her husband, and children; she exerts her utmost abilities to retrieve the prosperity they had unfortunately lost, she shares her hus∣bands care, and alleviates his concern—and should their honest efforts to regain their former state of affluence fail, she sets down perfectly hap∣py in the reflection that she had discharged, to
<PB N="91" REF="027654_0197_0FD56931EB928A80"/>
the utmost of her power, the duties of that station, in which it pleased Heaven to place her.</P>
<P>Yet, think not I mean entirely to set aside those accomplishments, which when kept under proper regulations, certainly tend to make the female character more irresistibly charming.</P>
<P>There are a certain class of women to whom these accomplishments are absolutely necessary, to their filling their respective characters with pro∣priety.</P>
<P>A woman of independent fortune may with safety indulge her taste for music, drawing, &amp;c. but, in the name of common sense, what has a girl to do with the fine arts, who, perhaps, after she leaves school, has neither time or opportunity to pursue those studies, unless by so doing, she neglects some more useful employment.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that it is not impossible for the useful and ornamental branches of education to be combined; nay, that it is even natural for a wo∣man of sense and discretion to endeavour to blend them in such a manner, as to render them only as soils to each other, and the woman who studies to unite in herself, the attentive housewife, the good mother, affectionate wife, well-informed companion, and accomplished woman, is certain∣ly
<PB N="92" REF="027654_0198_0FD5693445558638"/>
a character deserving esteem and veneration, we look upon her almost as a being of a superior order, and she is at once beloved, admired and respected by both sexes.</P>
<P>As so much of the happiness of mankind de∣pends on the females connected in their families, I have expatiated on the necessity of young wo∣men being brought up in the practice of every domestic virtue, more largely than I at first inten∣ded since not only the rising generation, but ages yet unborn shall venerate or execrate our memories, according to the advice and example we give our children.</P>
<P>If the daughters of the present age are suffered to remain totally ignorant of the domestic regula∣tions necessary to be observed in every family, what are we to expect in the next generation, but that the ruin which has already begun to shew itself in our most capital cities, will spread itself all over the kingdom, and sink it at last in one universal state of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>More, much more than we should at first be led to imagine, depends on the education of the female world. What ruin, what inevitable deso∣lation may not an idle dissipated woman bring on those who may unfortunately be attached to her person.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="027654_0199_0FD56935C0029428"/>
And on the contrary, how does a sensible, virtuous, well-informed female, exalt and ennoble the thoughts of all who converse with her.</P>
<P>Were every parent of my opinion they would first, by example, plant the seeds of genuine worth in the breast of their daughters, and by the tenderest care and mildest precept, cultivate each budding virtue, 'till they blossomed in full per∣fection, then ornamenting them with the elegant accomplishments necessary to complete the female character, render them at once the pride and glory of their country.</P>

<HEAD>URGANDA AND FATIMA, AN EASTERN TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the most beautiful vallies that lies up∣on the borders of the East lived Zegdad, an in∣offensive shepherd. He had but one child, and ha∣ving been early deprived of his wife, he lavished his whole stock of tenderness of Fatima.</P>
<P>Though fortune had not been lavish of her gifts to the father of Fatima, yet he wanted not the ne∣cessaries or comforts of life—his cottage was clean, and furnished with every thing useful; his fields supplied them with food; his flock with raiment.</P>
<P>Fatima was coarse in her person, but she was chearfull and good-natured—she rose each morn with the feathered songsters, and chearfully per∣formed the duties of her station; her whole study was to please her father, and a smile from Zeg∣dad was at any time, ample recompence for the severest fatigue, and like a cordial served to revive her drooping spirits. She would assist, unasked, in the most laborious employments, and when the labour of the day was past, she would lightly
<PB N="95" REF="027654_0201_0FD569395BCCA748"/>
trip over the green turf, with her young compani∣ons, while her father played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was calm as the delights of Para∣dise.</P>
<P>One day her father sent her to the grand Vizi∣er's, with fruit for his favorite—she was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira was reposing on a bed of roses, clad in all the pomp of eastern magnificence, while two slaves were fanning her to rest.</P>
<P>Fatima had never before seen aught but simpli∣city—she was filled with wonder and astonishment at the surprising beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as she gazed, envy and discontent crept into her hitherto guileless heart.</P>
<P>She returned home with a mind totally altered to what it was. Her rural pastimes no more de∣ligted her—labour was now a trouble—she had been a witness to the ease and indolence of Semira. If at any time she caught a glimpse of her person in the stream, she turned from it with disgust. Her days were joyless, and her nights spent in bewai∣ling her unhappy lot.</P>
<P>One evening, deaf to the solicitations of her young companions, she retired to a thick grove,
<PB N="96" REF="027654_0202_0FD5693AC8C992A0"/>
and inattentive to the sound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to her sorrow.</P>
<P>Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know so hard a fate—to eat the bread of labour, to sleep upon a rushy couch, while Semira is surrounded with splendor, is served by kneeling slaves, and sleeps on a bed of down! Why has nature denied me those ravishing beau∣ties, it has so bountifully lavished on her, her eyes are bright as the stars, her lips like half blown roses, her hand and arm like polished ivory. Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and favo∣rite to the grand Vizier—in this low abject state my being is intolerable, I will no longer endure it but in but in yon limpid stream lose the remembrance of myself and Semira.</P>
<P>At this moment the Fairy Urganda stood before her.</P>
<P>"Thy complaints are just, Oh! Fatima (said she) and if thou wilt relinquish thy home, and forsake thy father, thou shalt enjoy the utmost extent of thy wishes."</P>
<P>Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms and the Fairy immediately sprinkled her with wat∣er at the same time pronouncing some mystic words,
<PB N="97" REF="027654_0203_0FD5693DCB584048"/>
when she was transformed into a virgin of tran∣scendent beauty, and found herself in the garden of a palace belonging to the grand Vizier.</P>
<P>The lovely Semira had the day before offended her Lord, and was no longer a favorite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier—he ordered her to be led into splendid apartments, clothed with costly robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed slaves to wait on her, and comply with all-her wishes—and Fatima supplied the place of the de∣graded Semira.</P>
<P>She now thought herself the happiest among the happy; but the Vizier was passionate, capri∣cious, jealous, and extremely cruel, and it was not long before the disappointed Fatima discovered that to be favorite to the grand Vizier, was to live only in splendid slavery.</P>
<P>"But though (said she often to herself) though the grand Vizier's favorite is miserable, how superlatively happy must be the favorite Sultana of my Lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied station, how soon should the imperious Vizier suffer for his barbarity to me."</P>
<P>Again did the bosom of Fatima suffer all the miseries of discontent—the vaulted roofs, spaci∣ous gardens, and rich presents of the Vizier, no
<PB N="98" REF="027654_0204_0FD5693F5285F568"/>
longer charmed her. She sighed for the ensigns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</P>
<P>One evening she retired to an arbour, at the ex∣tremity of the garden, and throwing herself on the hanks where she had first seen Semira, thus poured forth her complaints.</P>
<P>"How wretched is the fate of Fatima— condemned to drag a hated being with a man who studies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the slave of his caprice and passion. Oh! could I but get from this detested place, I would fly to my Lord the Emperor, and bow myself low in the dust before him. My charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign the Empress of the East."</P>
<P>As she spoke these words, a sudden light enter∣ed the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again stood before her.</P>
<P>"Beautiful Fatima, said she, forbear your com∣plaints, the prophet permits you to enjoy your wish, then rise and follow me."</P>
<P>The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and placed her among a number of beautiful slaves,
<PB N="99" REF="027654_0205_0FD5694188984588"/>
from among which the Emperor was next morn∣ing to chuse a favorite.</P>
<P>In the morning the Emperor passed through the apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She was cloathed in the ensigns of royalty, led in state to the mosque, and in a few hours heard her∣self proclaimed Empress of the East.</P>
<P>But Fatima had, to the idea of royalty, annex∣ed the ideas of youth and beauty, how surprised was she then to find the Emperor, old, ugly, and deformed in his person, morose in his disposition, and jealous in the extreme—she shrunk from his embraces with horror, and contracted so set∣tled an aversion to him, that not all the splendor that awaited her could in the smallest degree com∣pensate for the many tedious hours she was obliged to devote to him.</P>
<P>Among the slaves that attended on Fatima, was the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Zynina, who had long, with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor bestowed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingra∣tiate herself in his favor, by rendering him some piece of service. To this end she cultivated the friendship of the new Queen, and by degrees drew from her the reason of her tears and dejec∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="027654_0206_0FD5695C8C66DDA0"/>
This intelligence was instantly conveyed to the Emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart be∣ing dedicated to another. Osmin willing to be convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration, desired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining the Queen's, where he might easily overhear any thing that passed between her and the deceitful slave, who immediately returned to her mistress, and artfully renewed the conversation.</P>
<P>Fatima, glad to unburthen her almost bursting heart, confessed her settled aversion to her Lord, and that death itself would be preferable to her present situation. "Then death be thy portion," cried the enraged Emperor, furiously rushing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering scimitar.</P>
<P>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "O that I was an humble cot∣tager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatness."</P>
<P>At that moment she found herself clad in her former homely apparel, standing at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addressed her.</P>
<P>"Fatima, I have shewn you the vanity of hu∣man wishes, learn from hence to be content with the allotments of Providence. Whatever be your situ∣ation
<PB N="101" REF="027654_0207_0FD56945A2FDDED8"/>
in life, submit to it without repining, and know that our Holy Prophet, who ordereth all things in this terrestrial world knoweth what is best for mortals: Fulfil therefore the respective duties of thy station, to the utmost of thy power: envy not the superior lot of another, but humbly take the blessings within thy reach, enjoy them and be happy.</P>

<HEAD>THE INCENDIARY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many evils that escaped from Pan∣dora's box, to infest and plague mankind, I know of none that has done more mischief than envy.</P>
<P>Good heavens! how depraved must be the heart that is pained by the prosperity, merit, or beauty of another, or rejoices in their debasement.</P>
<P>Methinks, when I look round the world, I am ready to hail each member of society as my brother or sister, I rejoice in their success, acknowledge their merit, admire their beauty, lament their misfortunes, and shed the tear of sincere compassi∣on over their vices. I would not possess a heart absorbed in selfish views for the universe.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027654_0208_0FD56947903A6758"/>
The man who lives only for himself, is, in my opinion, a monster of ingratitude; his life is one continued blank, except marked by some act of inhumanity. If we must reckon that day lost in which we perform no good action, what must we think of a life passed in a continued series of stupid inattention to the distresses or injuries of our fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Hail! heaven-born charity! bright resplen∣dent virtue; whose dazzling rays hide from the accusing angel multitudes of offences, blessed is the heart thou dost inhabit, happy is the man whose actions are guided by thee.</P>
<P>By charity I do not mean the merely sharing with those that need the superabundant gifts of fortune, though 'tis certainly our duty to allevi∣ate the misfortunes of others, yet by so doing we do not fully discharge the duties of christianity. Charity is that benevolence of heart, that meek∣ness of spirit, which leads us to judge favorably of the actions of others, never to propagate a story to the injury of a neighbour's character, but to stand forward the champion of innocence, and to defend those, whom envy, malice, or revenge, have aspersed. Conscious of its own rectitude, suspects not the integrity of another; ever ready to pour the balm of consolation into the heart wounded by sorrow; envies no person's superior
<PB N="103" REF="027654_0209_0FD5244D336370F8"/>
lot, but takes the portion assigned by providence; with gratitude, uses it with prudence, and gives the overplus to the sons and daughters of poverty, looks round the world with a smile of complacen∣cy, and wishes every bosom as tranquil as its own.</P>
<P>Yet there are people in the world whose chief pleasure consists in villifying and aspersing the characters even of their best friends, and sorry I am to say, those characters are too frequently found among the fair sex. Would they but consi∣der that while depressing the merits of another, they do not increase their own, but rather attract notice, and lead their acquaintance narrowly to scrutinize the conduct of a woman, who is so se∣vere upon their errors, it would certainly, in some measure, stop the unbounded licence they give their tongues.</P>
<P>I do not know a more hateful character than He∣catissa, she has indulged this evil propensity 'till it has become a part of her nature, and she could no more entertain you for a few hours without a tale of scandal than she could walk over the glassy sur∣face of the ocean. Many is the feeling heart she has wounded, many a breach of friendship has taken its rise from her malevolent tongue, she cares not how dear the ties she endeavours to break, she will sow dissention between father and child, brother and sister husband and wife, and
<PB N="104" REF="027654_0210_0FD569492126E488"/>
exult in the misery the occasions; under the fair∣est semblance of friendship, she will steal upon the unsuspecting heart, and after being treated with unbounded confidence, like the ungrateful serpent, sting the breast that harbours her!</P>
<P>She was, when very young, by the treachery of a near relation, thrown into a distressing situa∣tion, from which the bounty and generosity of a widow lady relieved her; not satisfied with merely administering to her present wants, she took her into her family, and made her companion to her daughter.</P>
<P>The innocent Anna conceived a sincere friend∣ship for her, and for many years they lived like sisters; innumerable were the favours heaped on Hecatissa, who remained with the family; till a worthy man, attracted by her person and specious manner, made honorable proposals and married her.</P>
<P>Hecatissa might now have been the happiest woman breathing—her husband was generous, humane, friendly, and good-natured to excess. He presented her to his family, who received her cordially, and the poor easy good man thought he had insured his own felicity, but Hecatissa soon shone forth in her own proper character.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="027654_0211_0FD5694A8B38D168"/>
She planted dissention in her husband's family, assumed an unbecoming authority over all his actions, and by her artful ascendancy contracted his heart, and made him treat with disrespect the very family who had sheltered her unprotected youth! Her vile insinuations were aimed at the character of Anna, nor was she the only object of her malice; every woman who possessed su∣perior endowments of person or mind, was to her a fit subject for slander. She wished no person to be more fortunate or happy than herself, she lis∣tened to every malicious tale with avidity, repeated them with pleasure, and aggravated every circum∣stance which had the least appearance of vice or fol∣ly. She would stoop to such meanness, that rather than not compass a favorite point, she would tam∣per with servants, to obtain the secrets of a family.</P>
<P>She was once on a visit at the house of Serena, she found her beloved by her servants, respected by her friends, and tenderly esteemed by her hus∣band. Vexed to see how superior she was in every respect to herself, she eagerly watched for some opportunity to lessen her merit. She wrested the most innocent and even laudable actions into guilt, she poisoned the minds of her servants, and tradu∣ced her reputation assuming the appearance of hu∣mility and virtue, she endeavoured to throw on Serena the odium of every vice which deformed her own character.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="027654_0212_0FD5694DAF369BE0"/>
But Serena was not long inveloped in the cloud Hecatissa had spread over her; she continued in the regular discharge of the duties of her station, paid no regard to the malicious slanders she daily heard, but, pitying the woman who could so far forget truth and justice as to blacken the character of one she professed a friendship for, treated her with the silent contempt her conduct merited.</P>
<P>No sensible person will scruple to affirm that He∣catissa is miserable. Hated and despised by all her acquaintance, her society is shunned like the pesti∣lence; and though by her consummate art she still imposes upon her husband, and retains his affecti∣on, her discontent and ill-nature prevent her reap∣ing any pleasure in his company; she is jealous, peevish and uneasy; in short she has such a legion of torments in her own bosom, that she often applies to a comforting cordial to raise her depressed spirits.</P>
<P>However despicable the character of Hecatissa may appear that of Prudelia is equally so. Prudelia is a woman who pays the nicest regard to propriety and decorum, she is ever prying into her neigh∣bour's conduct, and if their actions do not exactly agree with her scrupulous notions of rectitude, she hesitates not to conclude them abandoned and lost to every sense of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="027654_0213_0FD5694F0A7BC6E0"/>
Albert and Julia had been married near four years, during which time they had lived in mutual love and confidence, when their ill-fortune took them to live in the same street with Prudelia. Al∣bert followed the sea, of consequence Julia was of∣ten left for months together the guardian of her ho∣nor, the mistress of her own actions. She was lively in her disposition, but her heart was the seat of pure innocence.</P>
<P>Albert was gone his accustomed voyage, when Prudelia undertook to scrutinize the conduct of Julia.</P>
<P>Prudelia had visited her, she had been a witness to the innocent gaiety of her temper, she had even pretended to admire her vivacity and good-humor, but she whispered among her friends, that she thought it was highly improper for a young wo∣man like her, whose husband was from home, to receive so much company, or be so frequent in her visits abroad. She watched every movement of Juli∣a, was informed of all her visitors names, knew what time they came and went and even what hours she retired to rest and arose.</P>
<P>Julia was a woman of nice feelings, she was tena∣cious of honor; and the bare idea of that honor be∣ing suspected was extremely painful to her. She was uneasy at the watchful eye Prudelia kept upon her
<PB N="108" REF="027654_0214_0FD5695088866F20"/>
actions, not that she feared to have them srcutinized, but because she did not think herself obliged to be accountable for her conduct to any person but her husband. She therefore grew distant and reserved, and whenever Prudelia called on her, gave little or no answer to her many artful questions concer∣ning where she had been, or how she had spent her time.</P>
<P>About this time a brother of Julia's failed in bu∣siness, he retired to a house in the environs of West∣minster, to avoid the importunity of his creditors.</P>
<P>Julia was tenderly attached to her brother, she exerted every power to serve his distressed family, and even parted with her plate, and some other valuables, to raise money to supply the present exigence.</P>
<P>The attorney who had the care of settling her brother's affairs, was frequently with her for an hour or two together, and often she went away with him in a coach, and was absent for several days, as the business which employed so large a share of her time, required secresy, she never mentioned it to Prudelia nor did she when going out ever tell the servant where she was to be found.</P>
<P>One morning the attorney had breakfasted with her and she was gone with him to her brother,
<PB N="109" REF="027654_0215_0FD56953A98E6D80"/>
when Albert unexpectedly returned. The servant could give no account where her mistress was, and Prudelia who had seen him return, came over to invite him to dine with her family.</P>
<P>I am sorry my Julia is from home, said he, but there was no possibility of her thinking to see me to day, as I am returned at least six weeks before the time appointed.</P>
<P>Why yes, replied Prudelia, with a significant look, I fancy you will be a very unexpected guest.</P>
<P>It will be an agreeable surprize though, said Albert.</P>
<P>Perhaps so, said, Prudelia smiling, contempt∣uously.</P>
<P>The smile, the significant look, alarmed Albert, have you any reason to think otherways, madam, said he? Surely Julia will be pleased with my return.</P>
<P>Oh! most certainly she will, replied she, smiling again; but, no doubt, she would have liked a little more warning of your arrival.</P>
<P>By heavens, madam, said Albert, your words distress me beyond measure, you cannot mean to glance an aspersion at the character of Julia, and
<PB N="110" REF="027654_0216_0FD56955569090C8"/>
yet what other motive can you have for those con∣temptuous smiles. Tell me, dear madam, the mean∣ing of these ambiguous looks; but hold, if it is any thing to Julia's disadvantage I shall not be∣lieve it though uttered by an angel.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, (said Prudelia, assuming a serious countenance, in which was blended a mixture of pity and anger) far be it from me to injure the reputation of any woman, or ever interfere between man and wife, you are united for life, and 'tis therefore your duty to bear with each others foi∣bles, as well as you can.</P>
<P>My Julia has no foibles, replied Albert, or it she has I never discovered them.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to say she has, my good friend, but I wish she would come home.</P>
<P>Albert joined the wish, and the day passed on without much farther conversation.</P>
<P>As the evening advanced he grew uneasy, and when the clock struck ten, he exclaimed impati∣ently, where can she be?</P>
<P>Patience, my good Sir, said the artful Pru∣delia, you may not perhaps see her these two or three hours.</P>
<P>Julia was not used to keep such late hours, said he pensively.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="027654_0217_0FD569568D0C7058"/>
Oh! that is nothing, new connections form new manners she is never home much earlier, nay, 'tis very likely she may not be at home to night.</P>
<P>You seem to be aiming at something, madam, said Albert, for heaven's sake speak out, and de∣liver me from this torture of suspence.</P>
<P>This was the favourable moment for the vile in∣cendiary—she prefaced her scandalous tale, with the sorrow she felt at being obliged to give his worthy heart so much pain, said, had Julia re∣turned in any tolerable time, she would have kept the affair to herself, but as she found he already began to suspect something was amiss, she thought it was best he should be informed of the whole, that he might take his measures accordingly.</P>
<P>She then informed him, that during his abscence Julia's extravagance had known no bounds—that she had paid no regard to her reputation—re∣ceived the constant visits of one particular gentle∣man, and made frequent excursions into the coun∣try with him, where she staid for several days, that to supply her extravagance and that of her para∣mour, she had parted with her watch, plate, and o∣ther valuables, and concluded with saying, her heart bled to think so worthy a man should be uni∣ted to a woman who knew so little how to value her good fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="027654_0218_0FD56958087A9BC8"/>
Albert listened with every mark of horror and astonishment, at length (starting from his seat and stamping his foot with vehemence) he cried, 'tis every syllable as false as hell, my Julia can never have betrayed the honor I trusted to her care, or abused the confidence I reposed in her.</P>
<P>'Tis well, Sir, replied Prudelia, with a look of offended pride, you doubt my veracity, how∣ever you will find the whole neighbourhood are acquainted with her errors, as well as I am▪ nay call your own servant, she can assert the truth of what I say.</P>
<P>The servant was called, she confirmed the infa∣mous tale, and Albert vowed to be revenged on his innocent wife.</P>
<P>Prudelia had judged rightly, Julia did not re∣turn that night, and though Albert went home, and retired to his apartment, he never attempted to lye down, but traversed the room in the utmost agitation of spirits during the whole night.</P>
<P>In the mean time Julia was enjoying, with her brother's family, the most exquisite satisfaction. His failure was occasioned by remittances arri∣ving in proper time for him to make good some obligations he had entered into, the money Julia had raised for him, had prevented immediate
<PB N="113" REF="027654_0219_0FD5695B8D2B46E0"/>
bankruptcy, and that day several ships had arri∣ved with remittances, which would again enable him to appear among his friends with credit.</P>
<P>The whole family were together at his lodgings, and a smile of tranquillity sat on every counte∣nance.—How very happy I should be, said Julia, looking round her, if my Albert was joined in this loved company, I should then, at one view, behold all that is most dear to me on earth.</P>
<P>When supper was over, the evening was far advanced, Julia proposed staying with them all night, and walking home in the cool of the mor∣ning.</P>
<P>She retired to rest with a heart lightened of its cares, offered up a prayer for her Albert's safe∣ty, and sunk into an undisturbed slumber, little thinking the miseries that awaited her in the mor∣ning.</P>
<P>At six o'clock she arose, and kissing her little sleeping niece, who had been her bed-fellow, stole softly down stairs, and walked leisurely to∣wards home, enjoying the freshness of the morn∣ing, as she walked thro' the park, and contem∣plating on the happy change in her brother's af∣fairs.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="027654_0220_0FD5244BDA22B068"/>
It was near eight o'clock when she arrived at her own door. My master is come home, ma∣dam, said the maid, as she opened it.</P>
<P>Home, cried Julia, in an accent of joyful sur∣prize, and running eagerly up stairs, opened the door of his apartment, and would have thrown herself into his arms, but he pushed her from him with violence, and cried by heavens, this affected joy shall not cover your guilt; then looking at her sternly, he added, how have you passed this night, degenerate ungrateful Julia?</P>
<P>Julia had never been addressed by Albert before but in a voice of the most soothing tenderness. She staggered to the nearest chair, and faintly exclaiming, what a horrid change is this, and burst into a violent flood of tears.</P>
<P>Albert had never seen his Julia weep before, but his heart wept with her, but he now took her surprize for a token of guilt, and imputed her tears to the effects of art. He therefore regarded them not, but walked about the room in sullen silence.</P>
<P>Oh! heavens, said Julia, what have I done to deserve this; tell me, Albert, how have I forfeit∣ed your affection?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="027654_0221_0FD5695EEAAD2BC0"/>
By betraying my honor, said he fiercely, by becoming an abandoned wanton.</P>
<P>Heaven is my witness, I have done neither, said she, sinknig on her knees, Oh! Albert, kill me instantly, but do not suspect my fidelity. I will bless you with my last breath, and dying, de∣clare, I never entertained even a thought to the prejudice of your honor, or the purity of the af∣fection I bear to you.</P>
<P>Cursed dissembler, said the enraged Albert, and he spurned her from him with his foot. She shrieked and fell, her head struck the bed-post, and the blood gushed in a torrent from her fore∣head.</P>
<P>Merciful heaven, cried he, I have murdered her. He caught her from the ground, but found neither sense nor breath remained. Frantic, he rang the bell for a servant, and sent for imme∣diate assistance.</P>
<P>A surgeon examined her head, the skull was fractured. After the wound was dressed she open∣ed her eyes, and fixed them upon her husband.</P>
<P>Albert, said she, I know not who has poison∣ed your mind, or how you could suspect the fide∣lity of Julia. Believe me, I am innocent, in my
<PB N="116" REF="027654_0222_0FD569608D9785D0"/>
cabinet you will find papers, that will unravel any seeming mystery in my late conduct. I die, but dying bless you, for all your kindness to me. Ah! my love, 'tis not the wound I received on my head, but that which you inflicted on my heart, that terminates my existence! I loved you too well, Albert, to feel the privation of your affecti∣on and live; my heart unprepared to meet your unkindness sunk under it, struggled and broke.</P>
<P>She attempted to throw her arms round his neck, but nature was exhausted; she could only say, Oh! bless him heaven—and her spirit took its flight to the regions of eternal day.</P>
<P>Albert's distress was too great for description, when he sound he had by his blind passion, termi∣nated the existence of an innocent, valuable wo∣man, whom he loved with the most fervent affecti∣on. A deep melancholy seized him, nor could all the attentions of his friends rouse him from the torpid stupor he had sunk into, he grew worse and worse, and ended his days in a mad-house.</P>
<P>As there are too many Prudelia's in the world, we cannot be too cautious how we believe a male∣volent assertion, or give way to suspicion and jea∣lousy.</P>
