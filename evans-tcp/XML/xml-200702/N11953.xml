<P>RESOLVED, That Mr. President do signify the approbation of this Congress, and present their thanks, to the Hon.

<P>Mr. President accordingly addressed himself to the Hon. Mr. Middleton, and Mr. Rutledge, in nearly the words following:</P>
<Q><TEXT>

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When the hand of tyranny, armed in bostile man∣ner, was extended from Great-Britain to spoil Ame∣rica of whatever she held most valuable; it was, for the most important purposes, that the good people of this colony delegated you, to represent them in the Continental Congress at Philadelphia.—It became your business to ascertain the rights of America—to point out her violated franchises—to make humble representation to the King for redress—and— he be∣ing deaf to the cries of his American subjects—to appeal to the King of Kings, for the recovery of the rights of an infant people, by the Majesty of Heaven formed for future empire.</P>
<P>In this most important business, you engaged, as became good citizens; and, step by step, you delibe∣rately
<PB N="18" REF="015091_0017_0F95D179ED21B218"/>
advanced through it, with a regret and sor∣row, and with a resolution and conduct, that bear all the characters of ancient magnanimity. Your constituents, with a steady eye, beheld your progress. —They saw the American claim of rights—the asso∣ciation for the recovery of American franchises— and the humble petition to the King, for redress of grievances.—They saw the American appeal to the King of Kings; and, a second humble petition to the British Monarch—alas!—as unavailing as the first.—They have also seen the establishment of an American naval force—a treasury— <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general post-office—and the laying on a continental embargo:—In short, they have seen permission granted, to colonies, to erect forms of government, independent of, and in opposition to, the regal authority.</P>
<P>Your country saw all these proceedings, the work of a body of which you were and are members—pro∣ceedings arising from dire necessity, and not from choice—proceedings that are the natural consequences of the present inauspicious reign—proceedings just in themselves—and which, notwithstanding the late de∣clarations of the corrupt houses of parliament—the proclamation at the court of St. James's, on the <HI>23</HI>d of August—and the subsequent royal speech in par∣liament, are exactly as far distant from treason and rebellion, as stands the glorious revolution which de∣prived a tyrant of his kingdoms—and elevated the house of Brunswick to royalty.</P>
<P>Worthy Delegates! It is the judgment of your country, that your conduct, of which I have just marked the grand lines, in the American Congress,
<PB N="19" REF="015091_0018_0F95D17AAEE7E388"/>
is justifiable before God and man, and that, what∣ever may be the issue of this unlooked-for defensive civil war, in which, unfortunately, though glori∣ously, we are engaged—whether independence or sla∣very,—all the blood, and all the guilt, must be im∣puted to <HI>British,</HI> not to American counsels. Hence your constituents, sensible of the propriety of your conduct, and of the benefits, which, with the blessing of the Almighty, it is calculated to shed upon Ame∣rica, have constituted me, their instrument, as well to signify to you their approbation, as to present to you their thanks: and it is in the discharge of these duties, that I now have the honour to address you.</P>
<P>In an important crisis like the present, to receive the public thanks of a free people, is to receive the most honourable recompence for past services—and to deserve such thanks, is to be truly great. I know that it is with pain, such men hear their commenda∣tions.—Gentlemen, with the public recompence, I mean to pay in to you, my mite also; and lest I wound your delicacy, when I mean only to do justice to your merit, I forbear to particularize, what is already well known: I therefore confine myself; and I do most respectfully, in the name of the Congress, present to you, and to each of you, the thanks of your country, for your important services, in the American Congress, at Philadelphia.</P>

<P>The whole of the said report being gone through, the Congress came to the following resolutions thereupon.</P>
<P>Whereas it is absolutely necessary, that a con∣siderable body of regular forces be kept up for the service and defence of the colony in this time of imminent danger: Therefore,</P>

And it is hereby declared, That the said regiment shall be inlisted to the 1st of June, 1777, subject to the rules and articles for the govern∣ment of the troops, and liable to be sooner dis∣charged by public authority, having one month's pay advanced: Each man in the said regiment, at his own expence, during the service, finding his own cloaths, except a uniform hunting shirt, and hat or cap, and blanket, to be provided by the public; and also, at his own expence, to be con∣stantly provided with a good rifle, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, together with a tomahawk or hatchet: The privates shall be allowed five pounds, as the hire of their arms, during their service; nine pounds and ten shillings as bounty, and ten shillings daily pay; the Sergeants, twelve shillings and six-pence, the corporals, eleven shillings and three pence, and the commissioned officers the same daily pay, as those of the first and second regiments.

<P>And whereas it will not be expedient, to put any of the forces of this colony upon the conti∣nental establishment, so as to be subject to conti∣nental articles, and intitled only to continental pay, and to their discharge in December next; it being more proper, to keep all the colony troops upon the present footing, as to their quantum of pay, their articles, and the time of inlistment: Therefore,</P>
<P>ORDERED, That the Council of Safety do re∣turn the thanks of this colony to the Continental Congress, for their attention to its security; that they state the peculiar circumstances, and the heavy expences, which have been, and will be incurred, by this colony, in the measures necessary for her defence: And that they do request the Continen∣tal Congress to allow this colony so much money,
<PB N="58" REF="015091_0057_0F95D19A2E271040"/>

<HI>By Authority of Congress. To the Honourable the</HI> Council <HI>of</HI> Safety <HI>for</HI> Georgia.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letters of the 1st and 2d instant, and your resolutions, order, and proclamation of those dates, were laid before the Congress, transfusing a general and perfect joy.—And the Congress, sen∣sible of the vast importance which your exemplary conduct must be of to the American cause, unani∣mously
<PB N="86" REF="015091_0085_0F95D1B0E6707828"/>
voted their thanks; and I have the honour thus to transmit them to you, for your having de∣cisively taken the noble, politic, and vigorous re∣solution, That the vessels in the ports of Savannah, ready to sail, contrary to the interest of America, shall be forthwith unrigged and unruddered; and that, rather than the enemy shall possess those ves∣sels and your capital, ALL shall perish in a noble conflagration, lighted by yourselves—an instance of heroic principle, not exceeded by any, and equalled but by few, in history.</P>
<P>Your conduct, in citing such of the inhabitants of Savannah, as had abandoned their possessions in that town, to return to its defence, under penalty of being deemed to have deserted such property, and of being excluded from any support towards obtaining an indemnification for any loss they may sustain by a general conflagration, received the highest applause, as being worthy of imitation— The policy and justice of the measure are equally conspicuous.</P>
<P>In short, the Congress feel the greatest satisfaction, from their having anticipated your call for assist∣ance; it is sufficient that we know our friends stand in need of our aid. We hope, that our forces under Col. Bull, will fully accommodate your necessities: And you may rest assured, that we shall continue to afford the friends of America, in Georgia, every support in our power.</P>

<P>RESOLVED, That a sum not exceeding seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds currency, in bills or certificates, in the quantities, and of the denominations following, be stamped or printed, signed, and lodged in the Treasury, viz.</P>

<HEAD>A CONSTITUTION, OR FORM OF GOVERNMENT, Agreed to, and Resolved upon, BY The <HI>Representatives</HI> of <HI>South-Carolina.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the British Parliament, claiming of late years a right to bind the North-Ame∣rican Colonies by law, in all cases whatsoever, have enacted statutes for raising a revenue in those colo∣nies, and disposing of such revenue as they thought proper, without the consent, and against the will of the colonists. And whereas, it appearing to them, that (they not being represented in Parlia∣ment)
<PB N="136" REF="015091_0135_0F95D14FF0401CA0"/>
such claim was altogether unconstitutional; and, if admitted, would at once reduce them from the rank of Freemen to a state of the most abject Slavery; the said colonies, therefore, severally re∣monstrated against the passing, and petitioned for the repeal of those acts—but in vain. And where∣as the said claim being persisted in, other uncon∣stitutional and oppressive statutes have been since enacted, by which the powers of the Admiralty Courts in the colonies are extended beyond their ancient limits, and jurisdiction is given to such Courts in cases similar to those which in Great-Britain are triable by jury—Persons are liable to be sent to, and tried in, Great Britain, for an offence created and made capital by one of those statutes, though committed in the colonies—the harbour of Boston was blocked up—people indicted for mur∣der in the Massachusetts-Bay, may, at the will of the Governor, be sent for trial to any other colony, or even to Great-Britain—the chartered constitu∣tion of government in that colony is materially al∣tered—the English laws and a free government, to which the inhabitants of Quebec were intitled by the King's Royal Proclamation, are abolished; and French laws are restored; the Roman Catho∣lic Religion (although before tolerated and freely exercised there) and an absolute government are established in that province, and its limits extend∣ed through a vast tract of country, so as to border on the free Protestant English Settlements, with design of using a whole people, differing in reli∣gious principles from the neighbouring colonies, and subject to arbitrary power, as fit instruments to
<PB N="137" REF="015091_0136_0F95D150B0AB32B0"/>
over-awe and subdue the colonies. And whereas the Delegates of all the colonies on this continent, from Nova Scotia to Georgia, assembled in a Ge∣neral Congress at Philadelphia, in the most dutiful manner, laid their complaints at the foot of the throne, and humbly implored their Sovereign, that his royal authority and interposition might be used for their relief from the grievances occasioned by those statutes, and assured his Majesty, that har∣mony between Great-Britain and America, ardent∣ly desired by the latter, would be thereby immedi∣ately restored, and that the colonies confided in the magnanimity and justice of the King and Par∣liament for redress of the many other grievances under which they laboured. And whereas, these complaints being wholly disregarded, statutes still more cruel than those abovementioned, have been enacted, prohibiting the intercourse of the colonies with each other, restricting their trade, and depriv∣ing many thousands of people of the means of sub∣sistence, by restraining them from fishing on the American coast. And whereas, large fleets and armies having been sent to America, in order to enforce the execution of those laws, and to com∣pel an absolute and implicit submission to the will of a corrupt and despotic administration, and in consequence thereof, hostilities having been com∣menced in the Massachusetts-Bay, by the troops under command of General Gage▪ whereby a num∣ber of peaceable, helpless, and unarmed people, were wantonly robbed and murdered; and there being just reason to apprehend that like hostilities would be committed in all the other colonies, the
<PB N="138" REF="015091_0137_0F95D153B4650E30"/>
colonists were therefore driven to the necessity of taking up arms to repel force by force, and to de∣fend themselves and their properties against lawless invasions and depredations.—Nevertheless, the De∣legates of the said colonies, assembled in another Congress at Philadelphia, anxious to procure a re∣conciliation with Great Britain upon just and con∣stitutional principles, supplicated his Majesty to direct some mode by which the united applica∣tions of his faithful colonists might be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation; that in the mean time measures might be taken for pre∣venting the further destruction of their lives; and that such statutes as immediately distressed any of the colonists might be repealed. And whereas, instead of obtaining that justice to which the colo∣nists were and are of right intitled, the unnatural Civil War, into which they were thus precipitat∣ed, and are involved, hath been prosecuted with unremitted violence; and the Governors and others bearing the Royal Commission in the colonies, having broken the most solemn promises and en∣gagements, and violated every obligation of ho∣nour, justice and humanity; have caused the persons of divers good people to be seized and imprisoned, and their properties to be forceably taken and de∣clined, or destroyed, without any crime or forfei∣ture— excited domestic insurrections—proclaimed freedom to servants and slaves—enticed or stolen them from, and armed them against their masters instigated and encouraged the Indian nations to war against the colonies—dispenced with the law of the land, and substituted the law-martial in its
<PB N="139" REF="015091_0138_0F95D1547139B710"/>
stead—killed many of the colonists—burned seve∣ral towns, and threatened to burn the rest; and daily endeavour, by a conduct which has sullied the British arms, and would disgrace even savage nations, to effect the ruin and destruction of the colonies. And whereas a statute hath been lately passed, whereby, under pretence that the said co∣lonies are in open rebellion, all trade and com∣merce whatsoever with them is prohibited—vessels belonging to their inhabitants trading in, to, or from the said colonies, with the cargoes and ef∣fects on board such vessels, are made lawful prize, and the masters and crews of such vessels, are sub∣jected, by force, to act on board the King's ships, against; their country and dearest friends; and all seizures and detention, or destruction of the per∣sons and properties of the colonists, which have at any time been made, or committed, for withstand∣ing or suppressing the said pretended rebellion, and which shall be made in pursuance of the said act, or for the service of the public, are justified; and persons suing for damages in such cases are, on fail∣ing in their suits, subjected to payment of very heavy expences. And whereas, large reinforce∣ments of troops and ships have been ordered, and are daily expected in America, for carrying on war against each of the United Colonies, by the most vigorous exertions. And whereas, in consequence of a plan recommended by the Governors, and which seems to have been concerted between them and their ministerial masters, to withdraw the usual officers, and thereby loosen the bands of govern∣ment, and create anarchy and confusion in the

colonies; Lord William Campbell, late Governor, on the 15th day of September last, dissolved the General Assembly of this Colony, and no other hath since been called, although, by law, the sitting and holding of General Assemblies, cannot be intermitted above six months; and having used his utmost efforts to destroy the lives, liberties and properties of the good people here, whom by the duty of his station he was bound to protect, with∣drew himself from the colony, and carried off the Great Seal and the Royal Instructions to Gover∣nors. And whereas the Judges of the Courts of Law here have refused to exercise their respective functions, so that it is become indispensably neces∣sary, that during the present situation of American Affairs, and until an accommodation of the un∣happy differences between Great-Britain and Ame∣rica can be obtained, (an event, which though tra∣duced and treated as rebels, we still earnestly desire) some mode should be established by common con∣sent, and for the good of the people, <HI>the origin and end of all government,</HI> for regulating the internal polity of this Colony, THE CONGRESS, being vest∣ed with powers competent for the purpose, and having fully deliberated touching the premises, Do therefore RESOLVE,</P>

<SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very great, unsolicited, and unexpected honour, which you have been pleased to confer on me, has overwhelmed me, with gratitude and concern.—Permit me to return you my most sincere thanks, for so distinguishing, and un∣merited, a mark, of your confidence and esteem. I have the deepest sense of this honour—, the being called, by the free suffrages of a brave and generous people, to preside over their welfare, is, in my opinion, the highest any man can re∣ceive: But, dreading the weighty and arduous duties of this station, I really with, that your choice had fallen upon one, better qualified to discharge them; for, though, in zeal and inte∣grity, I will yield to no man, in abilities to serve you, I know my inferiority to many: Since, however, this, Gentlemen, is your pleasure, al∣though, I foresee, that, by submitting to it, I shall be ranked, by our enemies, amongst am∣bitious and designing men, by whom, they say, the people have been deceived and misled; yet, as I have always thought, every man's best ser∣vices due to his country, no fear of slander, or of difficulty or danger, shall deter me, from yield∣ing mine—In so perilous a season as the present I will not withhold them; but, in her cause, every moment of my time shall be employed: Happy, indeed, shall I be, if those services answer your ex∣pectations, or my own wishes—On the candour of my worthy countrymen, I rely, to put the most favourable construction, as they hitherto have done, upon my actions—I assure myself, of re∣ceiving,
<PB N="157" REF="015091_0156_0F95D163A5644400"/>
in the faithful discharge of my duty, the support and assistance of every good man in the colony; and my most fervent prayer, to the omnipotent Ruler of the universe, is, that, un∣der his gracious providence, the Liberties of America may be for ever preserved.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the General Assembly.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has afforded me much satisfaction, to observe, that though the season of the year rendered your sitting very inconvenient; your private concerns, which must have suffered greatly by your long and close application in the late Congress to the affairs of this colony, requiring your presence in the country; yet, continuing to prefer the public weal to ease and retirement, you have been busily engaged, in fram∣ing such laws, as our peculiar circumstances render∣ed absolutely necessary to be passed, before your ad∣journment.—Having given my assent to them, I pre∣sume you are now desirous of a recess.</P>
<P>On my part, a most solemn oath has been taken, for the faithful discharge of my duty—On yours, a so∣lemn assurance has been given, to support me therein. —Thus, a public compact, between us, stands re∣corded.—You may rest assured, that I shall keep this oath ever in mind—the Constitution shall be the in∣variable rule of my conduct—my ears shall be always open, to the complaints of the injured—Justice, in mercy, shall neither be denied, or delayed—Our Laws and Religion, and the Liberties of America shall be maintained and defended, to the utmost of my power.—I repose the most perfect confidence in your engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="015091_0159_0F95D165ACF458B8"/>And now, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> let me intreat, that you will in your several parishes and districts, use your influ∣ence and authority, to keep peace, and good order, and procure strict observance of, and ready obedience to, the Law.— If any persons, therein, are still strangers to the nature and merits of the dispute be∣tween Great-Britain and the Colonies, you will, ex∣plain it to them fully, and teach them, if they are so unfortunate as not to know, their inherent Rights. —Prove to them, that the Privileges of being tried by a jury of the vicinage, acquainted with the parties and witnesses; of being taxed only with their own consent, given by their Representatives, freely chosen by, and sharing the burthen, equally, with themselves, not for the aggrandizing a rapacious minister, and his dependant favourites, and for corrupting the peo∣ple, and suverting their Liberties, but, for such wise and salutary purposes, as they themselves ap∣prove; and of having their internal polity regulated, only by laws, consented to, by competent judges of what is best adapted to their situation and circum∣stances, equally bound too by those laws, are INESTIMABLE, and derived from that Constitution, which is the birthright of the poorest man, and the best inheritance of the most wealthy.—Relate to them, the various unjust, and cruel statutes, which the British Parliament, claiming a right <HI>to make laws for binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever,</HI> have enacted, and the many sanguinary measures, which have been, and are, daily, pursued, and threatened, to wrest from them those invaluable benefits, and to enforce such an unlimited and destructive claim. To the most illiterate it must appear, that no power
<PB N="161" REF="015091_0160_0F95D16672516C88"/>
on earth can, of right, deprive them of the hardly-earned fruits of their honest industry, toil and la∣bour—even to them, the impious attempt, to pre∣vent many thousands, from using the means of subsistence, provided for man, by the bounty of his Creator, and to compel them, by famine, to surrender their rights, will seem to call for Divine Vengeance.—The endeavours, by deceit and bribe∣ry, to engage barbarous nations, to embrue their hands, in the innocent blood, of helpless women and children, and the attempts, by fair but false promises, to make ignorant domesticks, subservi∣ent, to the most wicked purposes, are acts, at which humanity must revolt.</P>
<P>Shew your constituents, then, the indispensable necessity which there was, for establishing some mode of government in this colony; the benefits of <HI>that,</HI> which a full and free representation has established; and, that the consent of the people is the origin, and their happiness, the end of govern∣ment.—Remove the apprehensions with which ho∣nest and well-meaning, but weak and credulous minds, may be alarmed; and prevent ill impres∣sions by artful and designing enemies.—Let it be known, that this constitution is but temporary— till an accommodation of the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and America can be ob∣tained; and that such an event is still desired, by men who yet remember former friendships and intimate connections, though, for defending their persons and properties, they are stigmatized and treated as Rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="015091_0161_0F95D1672E15B6D8"/>Truth, being known, will prevail over artifice and misrepresentation—Conviction must follow its discovery.—In such a case, no man, who is wor∣thy of life, liberty or property, will, or can, refuse to join you, in defending them to the last extre∣mity—Disdaining every sordid view, and the mean paltry considerations of private interest, and present emolument, when placed in competition, with the liberties of millions; and seeing that there is no alternative, but, absolute unconditional submission, and the most abject slavery, or a defence becoming men, born to freedom, he will not hesitate about the choice.—Although superior force may, by the permission of Heaven, lay waste our towns, and ravage our country, it can never eradicate, from the breasts of freemen, those principles which are in∣grafted in their very nature—such men will do their duty, neither knowing, or regarding, con∣sequences, but, submitting them, with humble confidence, to the Omniscient and Omnipotent Arbiter, and Director, of the fate of empires, and trusting that his Almighty Arm, which has been so signally stretched out for our defence, will de∣liver them, in a righteous cause.</P>
<P>The eyes of Europe, nay of the whole world, are on America.—The eyes of every other colony, are on this—a colony, whose reputation, for gene∣rosity and magnanimity, is universally acknow∣ledged. I trust, therefore, it will not be diminished by our future conduct; that there will be no civil discord here; and that, the only strife amongst brethren will be, who shall do most, to serve, and to save, an oppressed and injured country.</P>
