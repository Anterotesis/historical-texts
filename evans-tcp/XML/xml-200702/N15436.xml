<P>ON the third instant was executed here, pursuant to her sentence, <HI>ELIZABETH WIL∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ON</HI>; charged with the murder of her twin illegitimate infants, on the <HI>12</HI>th of October, <HI>1784.</HI></P>
<P>As the case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> woman is of a singular nature, has engrossed the public attention; and as there are v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ports circulating respecting her, the following narrative, drawn up at the request of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unconnected with her, may be acceptable at this time.</P>
<P>WAS found, by a person with a dog, crossing the fields, in a piece of woods a little distance from the road leading from Brandywine to the Turk's Head, two dead infants. Upon enquiry, and from concurring circumstances, there was rea∣son to conclude, they were Elizabeth Wilson's; who some time before was delivered of two children, not far from the place where they were found, and who about eight week before, had left the house with the children; having a design, as she said, of going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Philadelphia. She was accordingly apprehended, and after examination before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Taylor, was ordered to this jail.</P>
<P>She was brought to trial the last court of Oyer and Terminer, which commenced on the 17th of October last, before the Honorable Judge Atlee; circumstances were so strong against her, that she was brought in guilty, and received sentence of death.</P>
<P>Before, at, and after her trial, she persisted in denying the fact; her behaviour was such, in general, as gave reasons to conclude she was innocent of the murder of which she was charged, or was an insensible, hardened creature, and did not expect to die for this crime.</P>
<P>It was some time after she was sentenced, before she could be prevailed upon to make a discovery of the person that committed the horrid murder. A great deal of pains were taken to make her sensible that a promise of concealment, under the circumstances she was in when made, and in a matter of such consequence, was not binding. She was very desirous of seeing her younger brother.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This note, in her own hand-writing, was found on her table—O could I but see my own brother! to speak just a few words to him, to ease my broken heart that is so distressed. Oh how hard a thing it is that I cannot see him!

I had three children in an unlawful way before I fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l into the wretch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> company of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From her account and description of the man, and from some persons who used Mr. Bogart's hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cross Keys).

At the time I fell in company with him I lived in Philade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦phia at the sign of the Cross-Keys, in Chesnut-street, at the corner of Third-street. In the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ginning of the year <HI>1784,</HI> he insinuated himself into my company, under pretence of cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ship, declaring himself a single man, and by repeated promises of marriage deceived and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦suaded me to consent to his unlawful embraces. In a short time after I proved with chil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the two dear innocents, for which I must shortly suffer an ignominous death. I told him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y situation, and then he dropt entirely his purpose of marriage; but told me, I must stay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I was delivered, and promised to bear all the expences, declaring I should n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want for any thing. Accordingly I rented a room of Joseph Rhoods in Union-street. I stay¦ed there a few weeks, and provided for myself; in which time he never came near me. And the time of my delivery drawing near, I was in great want of money, and after repeate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inquiries after him I found that he had left me in that unhappy condition. I then found, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not live in town; so proceeded to the house of Josiah Wilkinson, in East Bradford town¦ship, Chester County, where I was delivered of my dear infants. I continued at said house, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>5</HI> weeks, and then I went to Philadelpia and lest the children at Mr. Wilkinson's in order to find my deceiver, where I met with him and told him my deplorable situation. When I told him, I had two children, he looked in my face, saying, "the devil! you have? I requested him to do something for me by fair means, assuring him, if he did not consent, I should ap¦ply to the law: He answered, I need not go to law, for he would do for me, and seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sympathize with me in my pitiful case.

To which he consented, and gave me a small trifle to bear my expenses back to the aforesa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wilkinson's. He then appointed a day for me to return back to the city with my children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order for him to fulfil his promise. The fatal appointed day being come, I, according to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦mise, set off to meet him at the appointed place (Newtown-Square); but, contrary to my e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦pectations, he met me within two miles of the aforesaid Wilkinson's house.

Accordingly I went with him, and sat down on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, with both my children in my arms. He asked me to let him look at one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order to see if it look'd like him.

I told him I thought it was his place, according to promise, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em.

He then arose up, putting a pistol <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbidding me to make any noise; then he wickedly stamped on their dear little bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which the dear infants gave a faint scream and expir'd; he still keeping the pistol <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reast, forcing me most solemnly to vow, that I would never discover the dreadful act; to which I, thro' fear, consented. He then requested me to strip my dear dead infants naked. Thro' fear I took off each of their little gowns, but could proceed no further; my bowels yearn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g over my dear children.

<P>This confession she signed; afterwards the ministers were preparing to go to Phi∣ladelphia to lay it before the Council, which was about two o'clock in the morning: they were informed her brother had came down from Philadelphia that evening, stops <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Mr. Kerlin's, and said he would be in Chester early in the morning. It was thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roper to see him before the ministers went up; two persons went for him to his place, two miles from Chester; when he came, he informed he had a respite for her, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perseded the necessity of going that night.

<P>He took her body home, and some efforts were made to restore her to life, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain. The day following she was decently enterred, and a large number of respectable people attended her funeral. The minister that attended her in her last moments attend∣ed her to the grave. The exercise was solemn; a deep concern was conspicuous on the face of many, if not all that were present.</P>
<P>Thus ended the life of Elizabeth Wilson, in the 27th year of her age; innocent; we believe, of the crime for which she suffered, but guilty in concealing, or rather attempt∣ing to conceal, a crime of so horrid a nature, which she was privy to.</P>
<P>May others reflect, that a few years past she was esteemed having a virtuous character.</P>
<P>May they, agreeably to her dying request, take warning from her sufferings and shame∣ful end; and shun the paths of vice, which lead to endless woe: and as the sin that brought her to this shameful end is so predominant, may they in an especial manner guard against it, and be kept from it.</P>
<P>May they consider that sin is hateful to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, contrary to his pure and holy nature, and that he cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, but with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>most abhorrence.</P>
<P>May they seriously reflect on its malignant nature! and dreadful! dreadful! conse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nces. The wages of sin, says an inspired apostle, is death. Painful idea!</P>
<P>Death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tural or corporal, a seperation of the soul from the body. Death spiritual, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seperation of the soul from God. Death eternal, a separation of soul and body from God; the absence of all good; the presence of all evil; unspeakable torments in soul and body for ever and ever, where our Lord says, their
<Q>worm dieth not, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not quenched.</Q></P>
<P>May they fly from sin to HIM that bled, and groaned, and died the painful, shame∣ful and accursed death of the cross for sinners; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they may have healing by his wounds and life by his death: so shall they be saved from sin and its dreadful consequences h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and for ever h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reafter.</P>
