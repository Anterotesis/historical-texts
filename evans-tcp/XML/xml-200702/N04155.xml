</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR blessed <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour Jesus Christ,</HI> when he came down from the most excel∣lent Glory, to bring Life and Immortality to Light in a dark and miserable World, was pleased to instruct Mankind in the important Things of Salvation by plain, and most affecting <HI>Parables.</HI> Our <HI>Lord</HI> most commonly taught the People in <HI>Para∣bles</HI> (it being a usual Method of Instruction in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Countries) and he rarely taught the People without a Parable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> 4.34.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Design of our <HI>Saviour</HI> herein seems to be, to enlighten the Understanding, to assist the Memory, and to move the Affections, and Passions of the Mind; all which are well answered thereby: Sublime and spiritual Things, being clothed in such <HI>Metaphors,</HI> are brought down to the low and dull Capacities of Men. The <HI>Event</HI> indeed of such <HI>parabolical</HI> Representations oftentimes was, through the Inattention and Prejudice of the Hearer, the rendring him more hardened and secure in Sin, but the Design of <HI>Christ</HI> was to make Men wise unto Salvation: And it had this Effect up∣on the honest Hearer; but a very contrary and more

unhappy one on the <HI>careless Multitude,</HI> as it is intima∣ted to us in <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.10-11.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parable,</HI> in which our <HI>Text</HI> is contained, is a short, and very wonderful Representation of the great Affair of our Salvation. We are taught what vast Preparation God has made for the Recovery, and Happiness of a sinful, perishing World, intimated in the 16 Ver. by <HI>a certain Man making a great Supper: Matthew</HI> tells us, that <HI>a certain King made a Marriage for his Son,</HI> in his 22 Chapt. By which we are to un∣derstand, <HI>GOD</HI> himself, the <HI>great King</HI> of Heaven, and Earth, who has made a great Supper, and a Feast of fat Things, in the Gospel, for hungry and perishing Sinners. And when <HI>all Things were made ready</HI>; when a Saviour was provided; then many, even the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation were invited to come to this Gospel-Feast. The <HI>Servants</HI> of the Most High <HI>GOD,</HI> the <HI>Prophets,</HI> were sent forth to intreat them to accept of the rich Provision <HI>God</HI> had made: but <HI>they all excused themselves</HI> (or the greater Part of them); one had bought a Piece of Ground and he must needs go and see it; another had bought five Yoke of Oxen; and he must go and prove them; a third had married a Wife and he could not come. Hereby not only is the Tem∣per and Disposition of the <HI>Jews</HI> pointed out to us; but also of the <HI>greater Part</HI> of Men under the <HI>Gospel</HI>; who have their Hearts and Affections so much engag∣ed in the Cares of the World, that they cannot consult the Interest of their immortal Souls.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Jews</HI> had thus slighted the Invitations of a merciful <HI>God,</HI> and rejected the <HI>Saviour</HI> of their Souls: Then the Offers of Pardon and Reconciliati∣on are tendered to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Christ then sends forth his Servants, the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and Ministers of the Gospel into the <HI>Streets and Lanes of the City</HI>; that is, the <HI>Gentile World,</HI> to bring in hither the Poor, the
<PB N="7" REF="005119_0005_1016AA0FC3D1A940"/>
Maimed, the Halt, and the Blind: And the <HI>Lord</HI> of the Supper repeats his Command to his Servants with the greatest Earnestness; <HI>go out into the High Ways, and Hedges, and compel them to come in:</HI> Take no Denial of them; don't be easily put off by them: perswade; yea bring them contrary to their Wills if possible; and I will make them willing: Gather in great Numbers that <HI>my House may be full</HI>:</P>
<P>We have three Things intimated in the Words of the <HI>Text.</HI> 1st The <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Church of God</HI> pointed out by the Term <HI>House,</HI> which signifies to us the hap∣py State and Condition of all such, who are brought into the Kingdom of Christ: They are like Men in a House protected from the Storms and Tempests: They may rest and refresh themselves: they may take their Pleasure, feast and regale themselves in this House. The Kingdom of God is compared to <HI>a great House</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.20.</NOTE> where there are <HI>Vessels,</HI> some for <HI>Honour</HI> and some to <HI>Dishonour.</HI> 2dly, We have the <HI>miserable State of the Gentile World</HI>; and of <HI>all those</HI> who are out of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> set forth to us by those who are in the High Ways and Hedges, who are Poor, Maimed, Halt and Blind. They are like Men exposed to the Storms and Severities of the Weather, who have no House nor Home to repair to, who are ready to perish with the Hunger and Cold; and are so lame and maimed that they cannot help themselves nor go any where to save their Lives: Sinners are poor, maimed and helpless, expos'd to all the Storms of the Displeasure and Wrath of God. 3dly, We have the <HI>Pity and Compas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n of Christ</HI> towards such mi∣serable Creatures, and his Earnestness for their Salva∣tion. <HI>Go,</HI> says he, <HI>to his Servants, and compel them to come into my House,</HI> where they may be healed of their Wounds and made rich.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005119_0006_1016AA1289816D08" MS="y"/>But it is my Design to consider the Words before us under these two general Propositions.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Salvation</HI> of a <HI>sinful</HI> and <HI>miserable World,</HI> is a Matter, which our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ is much en∣gaged about.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Ministers of Christ</HI> should also have the <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>Sinners much upon their Hearts:</HI> And should use all <HI>reasonable</HI> Methods to <HI>compel</HI> them into the <HI>Kingdom of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>First, The <HI>Salvation</HI> of a <HI>sinful and miserable World</HI> is a Matter which our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ is much enga∣ged about.</HI></P>
<P>So he is represented in the <HI>Parable,</HI> as willing to take no Denial; <HI>Compel him to come in</HI>; dont be turn'd off by their Refusals; but intreat, and perswade them over and over again. The Salvation of Sinners was a Work, <HI>Christ</HI> had his Mind upon from all Eternity: and he took great Delight in the Fore-thoughts of it: <HI>His Delights were with the Children of Men</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.31.</NOTE> above what they were with the holy Angels of Heaven; but this could be upon no other Account but that of his being their <HI>appointed Saviour</HI> and <HI>Redeemer</HI>: He foresaw all he was to do, and suffer for them to bring them to <HI>God</HI> with Pleasure. And the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> perso∣nating our Blessed Lord, says <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Psa. 69.6.</NOTE> The <HI>Zeal of thine House hath eaten me up.</HI> He was swallowed up with a Concern for the <HI>House</HI> or <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> So much was the Mind of Christ in this Work, that he was <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Luk. 12.10.</NOTE> <HI>straitned until it was accomplished</HI>: Nothing could dis∣courage him from his Work. He would hearken to no Suggestions of going back from the Sufferings which were before him. And when the <HI>Apostle Peter</HI> once ventured to tell him, when speaking of his approach∣ing Sufferings, that such Things should not happen to
<PB N="9" REF="005119_0007_1016AA16A6806A30"/>
him, how sharply does he reprove him? <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Mat. 16.23.</NOTE> <HI>Get thee behind me Satan thou art an Offence unto me.</HI> I will hear no such Thing from thee; for I am set upon finishing the Work I am come into the World upon. His Heart was so much set upon it that he could deny himself of his Ease and Comfort that he might fulfil it: he could fast and pray whole Nights for Sinners, who had no Prayers to put up to God for themselves. He was so intent upon his Work, that he forgot his Food: or rather he made it <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">John 4.33, 34.</NOTE> his <HI>Meat and Drink to do the Will of his heavenly Father,</HI> in saving Sinners. He lived, as it were, upon his Work, he took so much Delight in it, and was so much concerned to finish it. But the Engagedness of <HI>Christ</HI> in this important Af∣fair of our Salvation will more fully appear from the Consideration of these following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> most <HI>freely,</HI> and <HI>readily un∣dertook for Sinners</HI>; became obliged to pay the <HI>Price</HI> of their Redemption, and recover them from a State of <HI>Sin</HI> to <HI>God.</HI> When <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> proposed the Recovery of a Number of the <HI>fallen</HI> Race of <HI>Adam</HI>; and made known the Design he had of a rich Display of his Grace in their Salvation; and declared, that in Order to this, some one must become a <HI>Surety</HI> for them, and pay the <HI>full Price</HI> of their Redemption: Then it was there was Silence among the <HI>Angels</HI>: no one dar'd to step in between an <HI>offended God</HI> and <HI>sin∣ful Man:</HI> Nor was any Man found, who could un∣dertake this great Work: But now, behold the Wil∣lingness and Readiness of the <HI>Son</HI>! how freely does he offer himself on our Behalf! and say to the <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>Lo! I am come to do thy Will.</HI> Here, <HI>I,</HI> thy <HI>only begotten Son,</HI> am; place all their Debt to my Ac∣count: I will pay thee all: Turn all the Strokes of
<PB N="10" REF="005119_0008_1016AA1968A83FB8"/>
thy Displeasure upon me: I will bear them. Don't pity nor spare me; but shoot thine Arrows at me; Cause thy Sword to awake against me. I will obey the Law they have broke. I will endure all that Pun∣ishment thine holy Law threatens for their Sins. I will satisfy thy Law; and restore that Honour to thee which their Sins have took away. Now, if it were a Matter of Indifference with the <HI>Son of God,</HI> whether we were saved or not, would he so readily have stept in, and become obliged to pay the whole Price of our Redemption? Would he have bound himself in a Covenant of Redemption to endure all that Punish∣ment due to Sinners; if he was not much engaged for our Redemption? He was under no Obligation to us. He might have left us to perish in our Sins with∣out the least Injustice to us. Nor did he stand in any Need of us; or the Services which he expects from us, whom he has redeemed; for he was infinitely hap∣py in the <HI>Bosom of his Father</HI> and could not be made more so. Nor did the <HI>Father compel</HI> him hereto: It was his own <HI>voluntary</HI> Act: No sooner did the <HI>Father</HI> make known his Purposes of Grace but the <HI>Son</HI> freely offered himself to stand our <HI>Surety</HI>; and become obli∣ged to pay the Debt we had contracted.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The <HI>Incarnation</HI> of the <HI>Son of God</HI> shews us, <HI>how much the Work of our Redemption</HI> was upon the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Son of God.</HI> It was an infinite Condescen∣tion in the <HI>Son of God,</HI> who was equal with <HI>God</HI> in all his divine Perfections, to take upon him the <HI>Seed of Abraham</HI>; and be made <HI>like unto sinful Flesh.</HI> The <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI> had a full View of all the Miseries which should befal him in <HI>our Nature,</HI> when he came down, and as∣sumed <HI>Flesh</HI> of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>; but yet, these did not terrify him: When the Fulness of Time was come, that he should come forth into the World, he readily lest his <HI>Father's Bosom,</HI> parted with the Joys and Glo∣ries
<PB N="11" REF="005119_0009_1016AA1B2C0735B0"/>
of that happy World above; he became Man, and veiled his Glory in <HI>Flesh</HI>: and with what agree∣able Wonder and Surprize, should we contemplate this <HI>great Mystery of Godliness, God manifested in the Flesh?</HI> It is with Pleasure the holy Angels desire to look in∣to and understand this wonderful Transaction. And had not the Salvation of Sinners been a Thing of the greatest Concern with the <HI>Son of God,</HI> would he have become Man? been made under the Law, and be∣come expos'd to the Reproaches, and Blasphemies of a sinful World? would he have subjected himself to the Condemnation and Threatning of a broken Law; and by being made Man become necessitated to suffer and die in our Stead? As the <HI>Son of God</HI> foresaw all these Things when he became <HI>Man</HI>▪ So nothing but infinite Love and Pity to us could move him to it.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The <HI>Laboriousness</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> in <HI>fulfilling</HI> his <HI>Ministry</HI> whilst here on Earth, discover to us, how <HI>much engag'd</HI> he was to <HI>redeem lost</HI> and <HI>perish∣ing Sinners.</HI> He was incessant in his Labours, unwea∣ried in his Pains to do good to the <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Bodies</HI> of Men. He went about from City to City, seeking all Opportunities of relieving miserable Men. He bore the Griefs and carried the Sorrows of the Chil∣dren of Men. He never turned aside from any mi∣serable Objects who sought his Compassion, refusing to help them. How industrious was he to reveal the great Purposes of divine Grace to Sinners, and the Way and Manner of our recovering the lost Image, and Favour of God: he took the utmost Pleasure in acquainting Men with the Miseries of their natural State, in convincing them of the Necessity they were under of obtaining Pardon and Reconciliation with an offended <HI>God.</HI> He did not spend his Time in Sloth∣fulness; but was careful to finish the Work he came
<PB N="12" REF="005119_0010_1016AA1E00F24B58" MS="y"/>
to do (k) before the Night come upon him wherein no Man can work. He was willing to spend and be spent in his Work▪ He did not spare himself; but encountered all Hardships and Difficulties; when they stood in the Way of our Salvation: and what was it stirred him up to all this Labour and Diligence but a <HI>Concern</HI> to finish the Work of our Redemption? this made him so zealous in all the Matters of God's House. This it was made him deny himself of his Sleep, and forget his Food.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, That <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>deep Concern</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> had for <HI>hardened</HI> and <HI>secure Sinners shews how much their Sal∣vation lay upon his Mind.</HI></P>
<P>However stupid and senseless Sinners were them∣selves; yet <HI>Christ</HI> had a most tender Pity for them; however unconcerned they were about their own Cir∣cumstances; yet <HI>Christ</HI> was full of Thoughtfulness about them. When they rejected his gracious Invitations, and sleighted his meanest Offers; Then <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Mark 3.5.</NOTE> he was grieved at the Hardness and Impenitency of their Hearts. <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Luke 19.41, 42.</NOTE> He <HI>wept</HI> over a sinful wretched World, who were neglecting the Things of their Peace. Our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> knew what Miseries, and Torments Sinners were hastening upon themselves; it fill'd him therefore with Pity to see them refusing the only Re∣medy for their Souls, and going on obstinately in the broad Way to everlasting Ruin, and this made the Son of God so affected for them, his being so much concerned for their Salvation.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, <HI>Christ's</HI> so readily undertaking all <HI>those severe Sufferings</HI> which he endured for Sinners, shows us <HI>how much his Heart is upon this Work.</HI></P>
<P>Sorrows were multiplied upon the <HI>Son of God.</HI> His whole Life was a Scene of Suffering and Sorrow.
<PB N="13" REF="005119_0011_1016AA20C25F9310"/>
Hence he is stiled <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 53.3.</NOTE> <HI>A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief.</HI> He was filled with inward Grief for our Sins and Follies: and he sustained outward Troubles of various Kinds. He became a Reproach of Men, and the Song of Drunkards: he had not where to lay his Head; although the Earth and the Fulness there∣of was his. But why do I tell of these; they were light compared with what he met with in the <HI>Garden</HI> and at his <HI>Death.</HI> The very Fore-thought of his Suf∣ferings was so great that he <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Luke 22.44.</NOTE> <HI>sweat great Drops of Blood</HI>: The very Vessels of his Body burst under the pressing Agony: how great was the Distress of his Mind which had so great Power on his Body? And from hence let us follow <HI>Christ</HI> to the Place of his <HI>Tri∣al,</HI> and <HI>Crucifixion</HI>: he was apprehended by a Band of Ruffians; who treated him in a most barbarous Man∣ner; who buffeted him; crowned him with Thorns, spit in his Face, bowed the Knee before him in Con∣tempt: they set him at Nought, and laid most wicked Things to his Charge, such as he knew not: and when they had condemned him, they led him away, obliging him to carry the very Wood upon which he was to be crucified: and when he came to the Place of his Crucifixion, they lifted him up upon the Cross, they nailed his Hands and Feet; and put him to the most exquisite Torments: and his <HI>Soul</HI> was filled with the Displeasure of God, when he hid his Face from him; then he cried out in the greatest Distress <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Mat. 27.46.</NOTE> <HI>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!</HI> and notwithstand∣ing these Sufferings were so very mighty, that the human Nature was ready to shrink back at the Approach of them; and pray that the Cup of his Sufferings might be taken from him: yet with what Chearfulness did <HI>Christ</HI> meet them, and with what
<PB N="14" REF="005119_0012_1016AA24ADCF2470"/>
wonderful Patience did he endure them! <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 53.7.</NOTE> he was <HI>brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep be∣fore its Shearer is Dumb, so he opened not his Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>He never murmured, nor complained under all his Sufferings; for they were what he was so much en∣gaged to fulfil: but would Christ have endured so many bitter Things from the Hands of Sinners; if their Salvation was what he was not much concern∣ed about?</P>
<P N="6">6thly, <HI>Christ's Patience</HI> with Sinners, and his <HI>repea∣ted Suits</HI> to them to accept of tendered Mercy, <HI>show how much concerned Christ is for the Salvation of Sinners.</HI> It is astonishing Grace indeed that one Offer of Mer∣cy should be made to a convicted and condemned Re∣bel: but how much more wonderful, that the Son of God should lay aside his dreadful Majesty, and put on the Supplicant to beseech Sinners to accept of eternal Life? Would he ever stand knocking at the Door of their Hearts, <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Rev. 3.20.</NOTE> begging for Entrance, <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5.2.</NOTE> till <HI>his Locks were wet with the Dews of the Night,</HI> if his <HI>whole Heart</HI> was not in this Matter? Would he ever bear so many Repulses from Sinners, and renew his moving Calls and Intreaties, if it was a Matter of Indifferency with him whether <HI>Israel be gathered?</HI> No verily, he would turn from them and leave them to perish in their Unrighteousness: he would say to them, let him that is <HI>filthy be filthy still;</HI> but the <HI>Son of God</HI> seems to be willing to take no Denial from Sinners; he leng∣thens out his Patience from Day to Day that he may have an Opportunity to be gracious to them.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, That the <HI>Salvation of Sinners</HI> is a Matter of the <HI>utmost Concern</HI> with the <HI>Son of God</HI> is evident from his <HI>appointing such a Variety of Means</HI> and his <HI>sending forth his Ministers to beseech Men to be reconciled to God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="005119_0013_1016AA2633E2E9C8"/>There are all those Means, and Helps provided for Sinners, which they can reasonably expect or wish for, to recover them from Sin, and fit them for eter∣nal Life. Our blessed <HI>Lord</HI> has committed the <HI>Reve∣lation</HI> which he hath brought from Heaven, to <HI>Wri∣ting</HI>; that we may daily study it, and be made wise to Salvation: The <HI>Sabbath</HI> is instituted to solemnize our Hearts, and recover our Affections from the World by the religious Worship of <HI>God.</HI> There is <HI>Baptism</HI> to put us in Mind of our Need of being <HI>sprinkled with the Blood of Christ</HI> to cleanse us from all our Filth, and spiritual Pollutions; and the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> is appointed to affect our Hearts with a Sense of the Sufferings of the <HI>Son of God</HI> for us. The <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel are sent forth in <HI>Christ's Name</HI> to teach Men the Way of Life, and perswade them to return to <HI>God</HI>; and <HI>Christ</HI> has promised his <HI>Presence</HI> with them: and when he foresaw that the best Means and most able Mini∣sters could of themselves do nothing without a divine Power, co-operating with them; he was pleased, at his <HI>Ascention,</HI> to send down his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> to guide, and assist his Ministers; and work in the Hearts of Sinners 'till they are transformed into the glorious I∣mage of <HI>God.</HI> And now would Christ have appointed such Means, would he send forth his Servants to urge Sinners to Salvation? Would he send forth his <HI>Spirit</HI> to supply his Presence here, if the Salvation of Sinners was not much upon his Heart?</P>
<P>Lastly, The powerful, and constant <HI>Intercession of</HI> the <HI>Son of God</HI> in <HI>Heaven shews how much he is engaged in his Work of redeeming Sinners.</HI> He who was cruci∣fied with wicked Hands and put to Death is risen a∣gain, ascended into Heaven, and ever lives to make Intercession for his People. <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 7.21.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005119_0014_1016AA293164B6E0"/>He has by his <HI>own Blood</HI> entered into the most <HI>holy Place</HI> above, and continually appears in the <HI>Temple</HI> there with the Names of his People <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Isa. 49.16.</NOTE> written on the Palms of his Hands. He pleads the <HI>Merits</HI> of his own <HI>Sufferings</HI> before <HI>God</HI>; nor are they ineffectual: the <HI>Father</HI> will not despise the <HI>Blood</HI> of his <HI>own Son</HI>; nor will he reject his Mediation in Heaven. The <HI>Father</HI> grants to his People here on Earth what ever his Son asks for above: Nor is the <HI>Son of God</HI> ever forgetful of his suffering Saints, <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 4.15.</NOTE> but is touched with a Sense of their Infirmities. He knows their State, he feels their Sorrows; and pleads their Cause before a merciful God; but would the <HI>Son of God</HI> al∣ways represent his People above, and plead their Cause, if their Salvation was not much upon his Heart?</P>
<P>Should any now ask, whence it comes to pass, that the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ has the Salvation of Sinners so much upon his Heart?</HI></P>
<P>It may be answered, it is not because he stands in any Need of us, or would not have been happy with∣out our Salvation. His divine Perfections and Bles∣sedness are not in any Measure encreased by our Re∣covery from Misery.</P>
<P>But the Son of <HI>God</HI> had entred into Covenant with the <HI>Father,</HI> and became obliged to redeem a certain Number <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">John 6.39.</NOTE> whom the <HI>Father</HI> had <HI>given</HI> to him, for that End: he was made by Agreement <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 7.22.</NOTE> a <HI>Surety</HI> for us: His Truth and Faithfulness were engaged for our Salvation, and whatever Difficulties were in the Way he must go thro' and not give back; lest he become false, and unfaithful to the <HI>Father</HI>; but he cannot de∣ny himself: he will fulfil all his Compact with the <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> and nothing can fail on <HI>Christ's</HI> Part.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005119_0015_1016AA2D3980CF58"/>And besides, this <HI>Covenant</HI> which Christ had entred into with the <HI>Father,</HI> there was the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God</HI> concerned in the great Affair of Man's Re∣demption: <HI>Christ</HI> is said to be <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.3.</NOTE> the <HI>Brightness of the Father's Glory,</HI> because in this Way of the Sinner's Salvation by <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>Glory of God</HI> would more won∣derfully appear, than in all his other Works both of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence.</HI> And since the <HI>Glory</HI> of all the divine Perfections would most clearly shine forth in the Sinner's Salvation; <HI>Christ</HI> was greatly concer∣ned to carry it on and compleat it; for the <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Father</HI> was what <HI>Christ</HI> was much concerned about; it was what he laboured and earnestly <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">John 12.28.</NOTE> prayed for on Earth. Nothing was too much for him to do or suffer that he might glorify his Father.</P>
<P>Nor was he only concerned for the <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> but being <HI>Man,</HI> and partaking of <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> with us; he had the most tender Pity and Com∣passion for the Children of Men. He felt their Mi∣series and he was grieved for them: He was willing to do every Thing that was necessary to save them from the insupportable Wrath of <HI>God.</HI> He foresaw how intollerable their Punishment would be; there∣fore he was grieved for them and wept over them.</P>
<P>And our <HI>Lord himself</HI> had much depending upon the Success of this great Work of Redemption. The <HI>Father</HI> had promised him as a Reward for his Labours, that he should have <HI>all Power in Heaven and Earth</HI> committed to him; that he should be exalted <HI>Hea∣over all Things</HI>; That <HI>every Knee should bow</HI> in Subjec∣tion to him. The highest Honours and Dignities were to be conferred upon him, upon his finishing this Work. And now had not the Work of the <HI>Lord</HI> pros∣pered in his Hands, he must have missed of all this
<PB N="18" REF="005119_0016_1016AA2FEFD65298"/>
<HI>promised Glory from the Father:</HI> He was therefore con∣cerned to finish his Work that he might as <HI>Man</HI> be re∣ceived <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">John 17.5.</NOTE> to that <HI>Glory,</HI> which he, as <HI>God,</HI> had with the <HI>Father</HI> before the World was. Thus we see his Truth and Faithfulness, his Pity and Compassion for us: A Concern for his <HI>Father's</HI> and a Desire for his <HI>own Glory,</HI> all conspired together to put him upon the <HI>utmost Engagedness</HI> for the <HI>Salvation of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>But I proceed now to the Consideration of the <HI>second general Proposition,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> should also have the <HI>Salvation of Sinners much upon their Hearts,</HI> and should use <HI>all reasonable Methods to compel</HI> Men into the <HI>King∣dom of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Is <HI>Christ</HI> the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls so much concerned for the Salvation of Sinners? And shall not his Ministers, according to their Measure, im∣itate him in Zeal for the Glory of <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Salva∣tion</HI> of Men? <HI>Christ</HI> has set his <HI>Ministers</HI> an Example <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">John 13.15.</NOTE> and requires them to do as they have seen him do. He expects his Servants should be fervent in Spirit in this great Trust, which he commits to them. He does not allow them to be slothful in Business; but they must be Men of Life and Resolution, concerned <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 4.16.</NOTE> to save themselves, and them that hear them. They must spend their Time and Strength for this End that they may win Souls to <HI>Christ</HI>: They must use all their Talents and the Gifts conferred up∣on them, that they may perswade and compel Men in∣to the Kingdom of <HI>God.</HI> But under this Proposition I design First to show <HI>how</HI> it is <HI>Ministers</HI> are to <HI>compel Men into the Kingdom of God.</HI> Secondly, Give <HI>some Reasons</HI> why they should have the Salvation of Sinners so much upon their Hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005119_0017_1016AA32AD2BE378"/>First, Let us consider <HI>how</HI> it is <HI>Ministers</HI> are to <HI>com∣pel Men into the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>But here, we are carefully to observe that our <HI>Lord</HI> does not require his Ministers to compel Men into his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in a Way, and Manner that he elsewhere condemns. We are not to suppose, our <HI>Lord</HI> would have his Ministers use <HI>external Force,</HI> and Violence with Men: he gives them no Liberty to afflict and torment their Bodies, in order to make them his Disciples. <HI>Christ</HI> will have free and voluntary Subjects; such as submit to him out of Choice, and not such as are for∣ced into Subjection; whilst they hate his Laws, and Government. There has been something of this Tem∣per in all Ages of Christianity, to use Power to make Men Christians: So our <HI>Lord's</HI> Disciples would have had him <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Luke 9.54, 55.</NOTE> commanded <HI>Fire from Heaven</HI> to consume such as would not receive him; but he told them they knew not what <HI>Manner of Spirit they were of:</HI> that is, how contrary to the Nature of his Kingdom such for∣cible Means were; for he aimed to rule over the Minds and Consciences of Men. Our <HI>Lord</HI> said to <HI>Pilate</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Joh. 18.36.</NOTE> that his <HI>Kingdom was not of this World</HI>: It was not to be set up in the Way that the Kingdoms of this World are; if it was, his Disciples would fight for him. Nor does the Word (<HI>compel</HI>) necessarily carry such a Con∣struction: There are other Ways to compel Men be∣sides Fines, Imprisonments, Scourges, Racks and Bur∣nings: These are <HI>Engines of the Man of Sin,</HI> and ne∣ver were contrived by a meek and lowly <HI>Jesus</HI> for the Advancement of his Kingdom, which is to be set up with Peaceableness, and Gentleness. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> compelled the <HI>Gentiles</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Gal. 2.14.</NOTE> to conform to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Jews, which he did no other Way than by <HI>Perswasion</HI> and <HI>Intreaty.</HI> The <HI>Corinthi∣ans</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="005119_0018_1016AA356CD9DF60"/>
<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 12.11.</NOTE> compelled the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to Glory, which they did only by provoking him, and stirring him up. But this Duty of Ministers in <HI>compelling</HI> Men into the Kingdom of <HI>Christ</HI> consists chiefly in these Things,</P>
<P N="1">1st, In <HI>teaching</HI> and <HI>instructing</HI> Men in a plain and <HI>forceable Manner</HI> in the great Truths of the Gospel. <HI>Christ</HI> sent forth his <HI>Apostles,</HI> and so he now sends forth his Ministers, to teach Men: they are naturally ignorant of <HI>God,</HI> and divine Things; and they stand in Need of being taught the first Rudiments of Christianity. Ministers are to teach Men who <HI>God</HI> is; how he is to be served: what Duties we owe him; and where we are to look for Help to discharge them. They are to teach <HI>Christ crucified</HI> to the World: And how Sal∣vation is to be had by Faith in him: The Servants of <HI>Christ</HI> must be <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3.2.</NOTE> apt to teach; prepared and disposed to instruct Men. And they should endeavour to teach with such Plainness and Demonstration that it may force the Assent of the Understanding; and the Sinner be obliged to confess these are Things which cannot be spoken against.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Ministers are to compel Men by <HI>sound Rea∣son.</HI> They should compare one Thing with another; and show the Fitness and Propriety of the several Parts of Religion, how they are all suited both to advance the <HI>Glory of God</HI> the Author, and the <HI>Happiness of Man</HI> the Creature. It is not eno' that Ministers fling out ma∣ny moving and affecting Words at Random: but they must treat Men as <HI>rational</HI> Creatures; for so did <HI>God</HI> himself; and says <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Isa. 1.18.</NOTE> <HI>come let us reason together.</HI> The Practice of the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> differed much from some Teachers at this Day; for his <HI>Manner</HI> was to <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Acts 17.2.</NOTE> <HI>rea∣son</HI> with the People. He <HI>reasoned</HI> before <HI>Felix</HI> of Righ∣teousness, Temperance and Judgment. Ministers of
<PB N="21" REF="005119_0019_1016AA383B3FE090"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> should be Men of <HI>Reason,</HI> for they are to preach▪ a most <HI>reasonable Gospel.</HI> And they should <HI>reason</HI> so closely to the Consciences of Men, that they may be wrought into a Compliance. If Ministers lay aside their Reason as useless; and treat Men as void of it, they can't expect their Hearers will have much of it; and if such Ministers make Men Christians, they may be <HI>passionate</HI> ones; but they never will be very <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>stable</HI> in the <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly, The Embassadors of Christ are to <HI>compel</HI> Men into the Kingdom of God by <HI>stirring up the Affections and Passions of the Mind.</HI> These are termed the <HI>Feet of the Soul,</HI> and if they are dead and unmoved, how∣ever the <HI>Understanding</HI> be convinced the Man will not be in Earnest for his own Salvation: When a suitable Degree of Knowlege is laid in the Understanding; and the Reason has been improved; then it is proper to rouze the Passions, that the whole Soul may be en∣gaged to avoid the approaching Vengeance of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>In the first Place, it is the Business of Ministers to awaken Men's <HI>Fears</HI> by displaying the Misery of their State, whilst out of <HI>Christ,</HI> and under the Condemna∣tion of a fiery Law. Men must have the Torments of the Damned set before them; and be informed, how dreadful, and insupportable the Vengeance of that <HI>God</HI> is, who is a consuming Fire: they must be put in Mind of the Worm of Conscience, which will always accuse and torment them with a Remembrance of their past Sins, <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Mark 9.44.</NOTE> and of the Fire that never can be quenched; that Fear and Trembling may take hold on Sinners; and they may enquire in earnest, what they shall do to be saved?</P>
<P>And when they are thus awakened with a Sense of their miserable Estate; then their <HI>Hope</HI> of obtaining
<PB N="22" REF="005119_0020_1016AA3B036E8E28"/>
Salvation must be encouraged: They will take no Pains to avoid Misery, if they have no Hope of its being possible. We have no such Example in the Word of <HI>God,</HI> of using all possible Measures of hurry∣ing Men on to <HI>despair</HI> without setting before them the <HI>great Encouragements</HI> they have to seek Salvation. Our <HI>Saviour</HI> told Sinners <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Luke 13.3.</NOTE> that unless they repented they would perish: but he also said <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Mat. 11.28.</NOTE> that if they would come to him he would give them Rest for their Souls. So the <HI>Apostles</HI> were mindful to inform the World, of an approaching Judgment and the Wrath of <HI>God</HI> to be poured out on an ungodly World; but at the same Time they encouraged Men to hope and seek for his Mercy. And designedly to avoid all the Encouragements of the Gospel in our preaching un∣der a Pretence they will lull Men asleep, is what we cannot learn from the Word of <HI>God</HI>: Men are com∣manded to seek; but will they ever do it if they have no Encouragement set before them.</P>
<P>So also Ministers must insist upon the <HI>Loveliness</HI> and <HI>Desirableness</HI> of divine Things; that the Love, and Desire of the Soul may be drawn out towards them. It is the Business of the Ministers of <HI>Christ</HI> to inform Sinners of the <HI>Loveliness</HI> of the <HI>Son of God</HI>; of than in∣finite <HI>Fulness</HI> there is in him: of the unspeakable Joys and Glories of an heavenly World: that they may long and desire to be united to the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and be entitled to the Blessedness of an heavenly State.</P>
<P>The Art of moving the Passions consists in these two Things. First, A suitable Representation of the <HI>Ter∣rors of the Law</HI> to awaken Sinners, and then Second∣ly, A seasonable exhibiting the <HI>Encouragements of the Gospel</HI> to encourage Men to seek and strive with the utmost Diligence. And he is a wise Scribe indeed
<PB N="23" REF="005119_0021_1016AA3C8B5D4188"/>
who can so time these, and blend them together; that on the one Hand the Sinner shall not be drove into Despair; nor on the other be encouraged, in his Sins, and strengthened in his Iniquities.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Ministers of the Gospel are to <HI>compel</HI> Men into the Kingdom of <HI>God</HI> by convincing them that they are <HI>themselves in Earnest for their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>As the Salvation of Sinners is a Matter of the ut∣most Importance, so Ministers are to engage in it with the <HI>utmost Fervour</HI>; that Sinners may see it is not a Matter of Indifferency with them whether they are saved or not: If Ministers are careless about the Souls of their People, they will be so themselves; but if they are all Life, and appear to be willing to spend and be spent for them; then it is likely Sinners will stir up themselves; and this is one Way of compelling Men; by treating the great Affair of their Salvation with the utmost Earnestness: <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Rom. 9.1—4.</NOTE> So the <HI>Apostle</HI> en∣deavoured to compel the Jews to receive the Gospel.</P>
<P>Lastly here, The <HI>Servants of Christ</HI> are to <HI>compel</HI> Men into his Kingdom by a due Exercise of the <HI>Au∣thority of Christ in his Church,</HI> and the most <HI>fervent Prayer to God for his Blessing</HI> upon all their Labours and En∣deavours. Ministers are to reprove and rebuke the Sinner that they may pluck him as a Brand out of the Burning. And the impenitent obstinate Sinner must <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 5.5.</NOTE> be <HI>delivered over to Satan to be buffetted, for the De∣struction of the Flesh; that his Soul may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, the Servants of Christ must remember that all their Teaching, Reasoning, all their Warnings, Invitations, Reproofs and Censures will be ineffectu∣al, without the <HI>gracious Influences of the divine Spirit</HI>; and they must wrestle with <HI>God in Prayer</HI> for the pour∣ing
<PB N="24" REF="005119_0022_1016AA3E6166A4D8"/>
out of his <HI>Spirit</HI> on their People to work effectu∣ally in their Hearts, and bring them into Subjection to the Son of God: and here it is we can most effec∣tually compel Sinners to <HI>Christ,</HI> by <HI>praying down the Holy Spirit of God into their Hearts,</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">John 16.8.</NOTE> whose Work it is to <HI>convince</HI> them of <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Judg∣ment to come.</HI> In the <HI>Closet</HI> it is Ministers may most powerfully compel Men into the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> by pleading with <HI>God</HI> for a Blessing on their Labours.</P>
<P>But I proceed to show <HI>Secondly, Why</HI> it is that Mi∣nisters ought to have the Salvation of Sinners so much upon their Hearts, and so earnestly to perswade Men into the Kingdom of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>First, This is the <HI>Command and Direction of God</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Isai. 58.1.</NOTE> that they shall cry aloud and spare not. They are set as <HI>Watchmen</HI> over <HI>God's</HI> People, and they are com∣manded to warn them to repent of their Sins, they are <HI>Shepherds,</HI> and they must pluck the <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Lambs</HI> out of the Mouth of the Lion and the Bear. <HI>God</HI> has very fully charged his Ministers to lay themselves out, and improve all their Talents this Way; that <HI>Israel may be gathered.</HI> And it is open Contempt of the di∣vine Authority for them to neglect their great Busi∣ness and suffer Sinners to perish: if we have any Re∣gard to the divine Authority and would not be found disobedient to the great <HI>God,</HI> we must apply our∣selves to our Work with the greatest Diligence and Resolution.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Servants of <HI>Christ</HI> have the <HI>Exam∣ple of their Lord</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> to excite them to the greatest Diligence and Carefulness in their Ministry. Never was such Industry, Laboriousness, and Concern manifested in any Affair as <HI>Christ</HI> discovered in this
<PB N="25" REF="005119_0023_1016AA4049C32928"/>
great Affair of Man's Redemption. He was careful to finish his Work, to glorify his Father and save mi∣serable Men. <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Luke 10.21.</NOTE> He mourned and grieved when his Labours were not succeeded. And he rejoiced in Spirit when he had Success. He denied himself all the Comforts of Life, that he might redeem Men from the Slavery of Sin and Satan. He could spend whole Nights weeping and praying over Sinners. And shall his Ministers think of the Labour, and Di∣ligence of their <HI>Lord</HI> in his Work; Of his deep Con∣cern for Sinners; And yet be slothful in their Ministry, and unconcerned about those immortal Souls that are committed to their Charge? Had we a Sense of <HI>Christ's</HI> Engagedness for the Salvation of Sinners, how would it quicken us to the greatest Di∣ligence?</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>infinite Worth of the Souls of Sinners</HI> is a sufficient Reason for Ministers to be much con∣cerned about them. One Soul is of more Worth than the whole World.<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Matth. 16.26.</NOTE> The Souls of Sinners are immortal: and if they are not brought home to <HI>Christ,</HI> they must be for ever miserable beyond all Concepti∣on. There is a vast Eternity before us, whither all Men are daily hastning; and as there is a Heaven of Joy for pious and holy Souls; so there is a Hell of Misery for all the Ungodly; and this short Life is the only Opportunity Men have to secure the one, and escape the other: <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 11.3.</NOTE> As they are at Death so they will be to all Eternity: <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Rev. 22.11.</NOTE> he that is filthy at Death will remain so. If Men die in their Sins they must perish in them: There is no Hope for them; for God will take no more Pains with them, and make no more Offers to them. And when Ministers think of
<PB N="26" REF="005119_0024_1016AA46E5C265A8"/>
this, that they have immortal Souls to save which are of more Value than Millions of Worlds, is it not e∣nough to spirit them to the utmost Pains that they may bring them into the Kingdom of God? Can they willingly suffer such precious Things to be lost? Will they not pray and weep over them Night and Day as <HI>Christ</HI> did, that they may not finally perish? We are unwilling a House should be consumed with Fire, and can we be willing an immortal Soul should burn in the Flames of God's Wrath?</P>
<P>Fourthly, When Ministers consider, that <HI>they must answer for all the Souls which perish through their Neglect,</HI> is it possible they should be indifferent whether Sin∣ners are saved or not? The Souls of Men are some of those precious Talents which are committed to Ministers. And their Lord will demand them of them another Day: When he shall come to judge every Man, and give him according to his Works, then he will demand of his Ministers, what are become of the Souls committed to their Charge. Then he will ask this and that Servant of his, where is this and that Soul which was committed to thy Charge. And what Plea can those Servants make who have not been faithful to their Trust? If Ministers have not taught Men their Duty; if they have not war∣ned them against Sin; nor urged them to make sure of eternal Life; <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 3.18.</NOTE> if they perish, their Blood will be required of them. But how awful is this Considera∣tion, that Ministers must give an Account of the Souls of their People? Is not this eno' to fill Mi∣nisters with the deepest Concern, that none may pe∣rish through their Neglect? Is not this enough to quicken Ministers to teach with all Diligence, to ex∣hort with Earnestness, and pray without Ceasing?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="005119_0025_1016AA48A1490EA0"/>Lastly, When we consider the <HI>great and abundant Promises, Christ has made to all his faithful Ministers,</HI> who are industrious to persuade Souls into his King∣dom, we see what sufficient Reason they have to be concerned to save Sinners. Every Soul, they are the happy Instruments of saving, will be an Addition to their Joy, and a bright Gem in their Crown. <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Dan. 12.3.</NOTE> The more Souls are gathered to <HI>Christ</HI> under their Mi∣nistry, the greater their Happiness will be.</P>
<P>Could we obtain an earthly Crown by listing many Soldiers to some earthly King, would it not enliven us to compel Men into his Service? And shall we not be as much concerned to fill up the Kingdom of our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> since he will bestow on us not earthly Crowns, which shall fade away; but unfadea∣ble Crowns of Light and Glory? He who does most for <HI>Christ,</HI> and immortal Souls will have a distinguish∣ing Reward in that heavenly World. And are not these Things enough to fill the Ministers of the Gos∣pel with the greatest Concern that they may fill up the <HI>House,</HI> and Church of <HI>God</HI>? That Sinners may not be left to perish in the High Ways and Hedges, whilst there is room enough in the Kingdom of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>The APPLICATION of the whole may be in the following Uses.</P>
<P>USE I. Of <HI>Information,</HI> and from what you have heard you may learn these following Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Salvation of Sinners is a Matter of the <HI>greatest Importance,</HI> and <HI>absolutely necessary for them.</HI> The Son of God never would take such vast Pains therefor, and be so much concerned about it, if it were a Trifle, and a Thing of Indifferency, whether they
<PB N="28" REF="005119_0026_1016AA4E4E309568"/>
are saved or perish. Would the Son of God ever have come down from Heaven, veiled his Glory in Flesh? Would he voluntarily have subjected him∣self to the Law and become obliged to obey it, who himself was the Author and Giver of it to Mankind? Would he so freely entered upon a Life of Labour, Pain and Sufferings amongst Men? Would the eternal <HI>Son of God,</HI> who was the <HI>Brightness of his Father's Glory,</HI> so readi∣ly have subjected himself to the Curses and Reproa∣ches of Men, if he is not engaged in this great and important Work of our Salvation? It was attended with the greatest Difficulties; and the most bitter Sufferings must be endured before ever it could be compleated; all which the <HI>Son of God</HI> had a full View of, when he undertook it: and who can ima∣gine that so great a Personage as the <HI>Son of God</HI> should have his Mind from all Eternity upon this Work: That so wise Counsel should be held about it; that such vast Preparations should be made for it; that <HI>Christ</HI> should take such infinite Pains to ac∣complish it, and suffer more than is possible to con∣ceive of, if it were a Trifle and a Thing of no great Concern? No verily the <HI>Son of God</HI> would never have born Reproach: He never would have fasted and chastised his Soul; he never would have been grieved at the Hardness of Men's Hearts, nor would he have wept over secure Sinners, had he not seen their Salvation to be a Thing of the last Importance.—</P>
<P N="2">2. From what you have heard, you may see what <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> we owe the <HI>Son of God:</HI> That he should be so much concerned, and do so much for our Redemption. A Pity and Concern for others, and a Readiness to help, and relieve, naturally commend Love and Esteem in other Cases; A poor Man loves the rich, when he sees him condoling his Poverty,
<PB N="29" REF="005119_0027_1016AA4FD7FB8E90"/>
and ready to feed and clothe him: a sick Man loves the Physitian, who has Compassion on him under his Pains and Diseases, who is ready to administer for his healing: So whatever our Calamities be, our Love and Esteem is drawn out to such as have Bowels of Compassion for us, be it so they only speak comfor∣table Words to us; how much more when they re∣lieve us? But how much more is <HI>Christ</HI> to be loved by us, who is concerned for us in Things of infinite Moment? who has pitied our miserable Souls under their spiritual Poverty, and dreadful Diseases; Who has purchased at the dearest Rate for us all we want to remedy our miserable Circumstances; Who offers us the Food of eternal Life, and Streams of living Water that we may never hunger and thirst more; Who tenders the spotless Robes of his own Righte∣ousness to cover our Nakedness; who tenders Gold tried in the Fire that we may be rich, who will heal all our Plagues and Infirmities and raise us to the highest Dignities and Honours, even to be Kings and Priests to the Most High <HI>God</HI>; who is concerned for us that we should not despise these Offers of Mer∣cy; earnestly knocks at the Doors of our Hearts until his Locks are wet with the Dews of Night: And beseeches us to hearken to him; that we don't perish. Shall <HI>Christ</HI> do so much for us and we have no Pity for our selves, and no Love to him for it? This is brutish and most horrid Ingratitude indeed!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If the <HI>Son of God</HI> is so much concerned a∣bout our Salvation does it lie so much upon his Mind, then certainly we ought to be concerned a∣bout it our selves. Shall he fast for us, and we live in the Gratifications of the Flesh ourselves? Shall he pray till his Soul is spent and melted within him, and we restrain Prayer before <HI>God</HI>? Shall he weep and mourn over us, and we have no Tears to shed for
<PB N="30" REF="005119_0028_1016AA52992C9868"/>
our selves? Shall he agonize and sweat great Drops of Blood for us, and we not wrestle and strive to o∣vercome the Enemies of our Souls? Can this be and yet we have any Sense of our State and the dreadful Misery hastening upon us? Let us all be up, and about our Business, as <HI>Christ</HI> hath set us an Example: Let us all endeavour to awaken in our own Minds the most lively Concern for our eternal Well-Being by serious Meditation and fervent Prayer to <HI>God</HI> to realize spiritual Things to our Souls. Let us often reflect upon <HI>Christ</HI>'s Labour, his Prayers and his Tears for us. Let us often wonder and admire that he should have such Concern for us; and we be no more concerned for our own precious immortal Souls, which must be happy or miserable, according to the Provision we make for them in this short Life to all Eternity. We can't be too much concerned for them; We can't do too much for their Well-Being, the lit∣tle while we have to live here.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Has <HI>Christ</HI> the Salvation of Sinners so much upon his Mind, then you see what Encourage∣ment Sinners have to seek Salvation by <HI>Christ</HI>: He will assuredly <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 7.25.</NOTE> save all that come to the <HI>Father</HI> in and by him, <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">John 6.37.</NOTE> nor will he cast out any that come to him for Life. He stands with open Arms to receive repenting Sinners: He holds out a Scepter of Grace to them that they may come to God, with Boldness in this Way of Access by the <HI>Blood of Christ.</HI> The <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> will reject none; but assures us that all shall be welcome. Whosoever will let <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rev. 22.17.</NOTE> him come, is the Language of the <HI>Son of God</HI> to Sinners. <HI>Christ</HI> cannot deny himself: he will fulfil all his Pro∣mises to such as depend upon him for Salvation. He is not only able to save Sinners, but he is willing to
<PB N="31" REF="005119_0029_1016AA54553BAB40"/>
undertake for them and rescue them from the Jaws of Destruction: his Heart is set upon this Work, he needs no large Intreaties to grant Salvation to you: are you but willing to be saved by him and give divine Grace the Glory, <HI>Christ</HI> is ready: There is not the least Backwardness on his Part: his Delights are with the Children of Men: He has paid the Price of your Redemption: he has satisfied the Law, and appeased the incensed Wrath of <HI>God,</HI> he has suffered the whole Penalty due for Sin: he has shed his Blood to cleanse your Souls and wash out the Stains of Sin: and is it possible after all this that <HI>Christ</HI> should deceive and dis∣appoint you, and turn you off with Coldness when you come to him? No verily, Heaven and Earth may pass away but not the least Jot of <HI>Christ's</HI> Promi∣ses fail: If <HI>Christ</HI> is so much engaged in this Work; Here is all the Encouragement you want. What can you ask for more? He is able to save you; he has all you want, and he is perfectly willing. Let none therefore ever excuse themselves in their Sloth and Negligence in seeking Salvation under any Pretence they have not Encouragement enough. But let all young and old look to the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> for Pardon and Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> If this is the Business of Ministers to com∣pel Souls into the Kingdom of <HI>God,</HI> and if it is thus required of them to improve their utmost Endeavours to bring Souls to <HI>Christ,</HI> then they may justly cry out with the <HI>Apostle, Who is sufficient for these Things?</HI> Who is it knows, in all Respects, how to deal with immortal Souls in the momentous Affairs of Eterni∣ty? Who is that <HI>Scribe</HI> instructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, who can bring out of his Treasure Things new and old, who can give to every one his Portion in their Season? Who is it knows how and when to insist upon the <HI>Terrors of the Law,</HI> and discover the
<PB N="32" REF="005119_0030_1016AA5841878E48"/>
terrible Wrath of God to the Sinner; and point out to him the Miseries and Agonies of the damned: and then can so intermingle the <HI>Gentle Motives of the Gospel</HI> as to excite the <HI>Hope of the Sinner.</HI> So that, on the one Hand, he may be suitably concerned to save his Soul, and on the other, may not be hurried on to despair of Mercy? How few can so speak to Sinners as to awaken them, and so hold out the rich Invitations of Mercy, that the weary and Sin-burthen Sinner may accept of them? How much Need do Ministers stand in of the Grace of <HI>Christ</HI> and the Aids of his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> in this great Work? They have no Strength nor Wisdom of their own, they never would bring one Soul into the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> did not the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> work with them and give Success to their Labours. It is he subdues the People under himself and makes them willing in the Day of his Power.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> If Ministers are sent forth to perswade Men into the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> then it is the <HI>In∣terest of a People to be instant in Prayer to God for them.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. 3.1.</NOTE> <HI>Pray for us,</HI> says the <HI>Apostle</HI> to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> that the <HI>Word of God may have free Course</HI>: If Mi∣nisters are never so faithful and laborious, if they spend and be spent for your Souls, it will avail no∣thing to your Salvation, if <HI>God</HI> work not within you both to will and to do of his good Pleasure. The Conversion of your Souls is the Work of God. And can you expect he will ever make you the happy Subjects of it, if you pray not for it? Be found often therefore upon your Knees, wrestling with God for your Ministers, that <HI>God</HI> would make them Sons of Thunder to <HI>secure Sinners,</HI> and <HI>Sons of Conso∣lation</HI> to his <HI>own Children.</HI> Ministers are commonly
<PB N="33" REF="005119_0031_1016AA5B0844F568"/>
such as a People pray them to be; and their <HI>Success</HI> is usually in Proportion to their <HI>earnest Prayers</HI> for their Ministers. If you neglect to pray for them God has set over you, there is too much Reason to fear, they will only prove a Savour of Death unto Death to your Souls.</P>
<P>USE II. of <HI>Awakening to Sinners.</HI> And is it so that <HI>Christ</HI> has taken vast Pains for your Salvation? Is he still waiting upon you and pleading with you, in his Word, and by his Ministers? And are his Ministers endeavouring to perswade and compel you into the Kingdom of Christ? Then think upon these Things.</P>
<P>First, How <HI>inexcuseable</HI> you will be found in the <HI>great Day of Accounts.</HI></P>
<P>You will have no Plea to make for your selves, your own Mouths will condemn you, your own Con∣sciences will testify what Pains have been taken with you: how earnestly the <HI>Son of God</HI> has intreated you: How his Ministers have urged you. Then <HI>Christ</HI> will tell you how you stopped your Ears against his Calls, and mocked at all his Reproofs: Then <HI>Christ</HI> will put you in Mind of all the precious Oppor∣tunities you have had and how much you have a∣bused them: Then he will tell you how he laid hold on you by his Ministers, and the Convictions of his <HI>Spirit</HI> and would have plucked you out of the Fire of Sin and Hell; but you offered Violence to his Ser∣vants, and despite to the <HI>Spirit</HI> of his Grace, &amp; choose rather to perish in your Sins, than accept of Life by him: And what can the Sinner say when his Judge thus convicts him? What Shame and Confusion will cover the Face of every Sinner in that Day? Their own Hearts will condemn them and their <HI>Judge</HI> is greater than they. It is impossible to express the
<PB N="34" REF="005119_0032_1016AA5DC5B3F218"/>
Horror and the Confusion that Sinners who perish un∣der the Light of the Gospel will be in at that Day: They would gladly have the Mountains and Rocks fall on them to cover them from the Face of their <HI>Judge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let the Sinner seriously think, what an <HI>insupportable Punishment</HI> he is bringing upon himself by refusing to enter into the Kingdom of <HI>God</HI>: all the Pains and Intreaties that are used with Sinners to com∣pel them into the Kingdom of <HI>God,</HI> serve to increase and aggravate their everlasting Condemnation and Torment. If all the Pains which are taken with you prove ineffectual for your Salvation, it is likely they will greatly inhance your Misery. Every slighted Call, and every abused Invitation will lay a Founda∣tion for the more severe Reflections of Conscience. How insupportable will your Punishment be if you stand out against all the Earnestness of the <HI>Son of God?</HI> It will be more tolerable for the Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> than for you. Yea, it will be more tolera∣ble for those impious <HI>Jews,</HI> who with wicked Hands took our <HI>Blessed Saviour and put him to Death,</HI> than for you; <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Acts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.17.</NOTE> for they did it <HI>ignorantly</HI> the Apostle tells us; but you reject him; who <HI>know he is the Son of God</HI>; they insulted him in the Form of a Servant; in his State of Humiliation: but you in his State of Glory upon his Throne; and let the Sinner think with him∣self, how he can bear an endless Eternity reflecting upon the Pity, the Patience, the Long-suffering, and moving Invitations of the <HI>Son of God</HI>: and how he despised and rejected them; How can you bear in Hell to remember what Pains Ministers have taken with you? how they urged you to subject yourselves to the Government of the <HI>Son of God</HI>; and you would not?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="005119_0033_1016AA5F4C39F970"/>But I will shut up my Discourse with a Word of <HI>Address</HI> to my <HI>Brother</HI> now to be sent forth to <HI>compel Souls</HI> into the <HI>Kingdom of Christ</HI>; and to this <HI>little Flock</HI> over whom he is now to receive a solemn Charge.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, To you my <HI>dear Brother.</HI> You see what the Work and Business, which is before you is. It is to bring Men into the Kingdom of <HI>Christ</HI>: You are to go forth and compel Men into the Kingdom of your as∣cended <HI>Lord and Saviour</HI>: You are to fill up his <HI>House and Church</HI>: you are to use all the Gifts <HI>God</HI> has be∣stowed upon you for this End: you must lay yourself out for this Work; and be willing to spend and be spent, that you may perswade Souls to <HI>Christ</HI>: It is the most honourable Employment in the World, vast∣ly more than to be Embassadors for the greatest Prin∣ces on Earth. And it is a great and difficult Work: Too great for even the Angels to undertake them∣selves: but here is your Comfort; <HI>Christ</HI> is engaged in this Work as well as you: And he has it more up∣on his Heart, than you can have upon your's. He has <HI>promised you his Presence,</HI> if you give up yourself to his Service. And you may always remember the more you do for <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>immortal Souls</HI> the <HI>greater</HI> your Re∣ward will be in <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To this <HI>little Flock</HI> who are about to enter into <HI>Covenant</HI> and receive a <HI>Pastor</HI> over them in the <HI>Lord.</HI> And you have heard what is to be the Work of <HI>your Pastor,</HI> he is to compel you into the <HI>Service of Christ,</HI> he is to importune you, and use all possible Ear∣nestness: You must therefore suffer him to teach you with Plainness. To reprove you with Zeal, and warn you with Earnestness, you must allow him to observe your State, and warn you against your beloved Sins that you may be plucked as Brands out of the Burning: You must allow him to watch over you, and be jeal∣ous of you; That he may suit himself to your State,
<PB N="36" REF="005119_0034_1016AA63775CDDE8"/>
and address you with the greater Propriety: You must allow him to use a sort of Violence with you: for this is his Work: and then you are to remember it is a <HI>reasonable Constraint</HI> he is to use with you; and it con∣cerns you to strive with him and take Pains for your own Souls whilst he is labouring for them: otherwise he will labour in vain, and spend his Strength for Nought: You must attend upon his Ministry, hearken to his Counsels, and obey all those Precepts he shall bring you from the <HI>Word of God:</HI> and that he may come to you in the Fulness of the Blessings of the Gospel and have many Seals of his Ministry among you is our Desire and Prayer to the <HI>God of all Grace and Consolation.</HI></P>
