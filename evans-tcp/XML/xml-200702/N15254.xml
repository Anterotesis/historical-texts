<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE design of this Third Part of the Gram∣matical Institute of the English Language, is to furnish common English Schools with a va∣riety of exercises for reading and speaking, at a small expence. Colleges and Academies are al∣ready supplied with many excellent collections for this purpose; among which, the <HI>Art of Speaking, Enfield's Speaker, Enfield's Exercises, the Precep∣tor, the Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,</HI> are used with great reputation. But these are too large and expensive for the body of the people to purchase, who cannot afford a school for their children but a few months in a year. The want of some small books of this kind, has confined most of our schools to the use of the Bible, the size of which and the smallness of the type, has occa∣sioned distinct portions of it, particularly the Psalms and the New Testament, to be printed separately on a larger type. But to the common and sole use of the Bible or any part of it in schools, there are two capital objections.</P>
<P>In the first place, the style is so uniform and so different from that of the present age, that chil∣dren, who are confined to it, never acquire a com∣plete knowledge of words, and of the modern manne, of writing, to read other books with tol∣erable propriety.</P>
<P>In the second place, it has often been observed by men of piety, that such a common use of the Bible, is a kind of prostitution of divine truth to secular purposes—that children are insensibly led, by a habit of familiarity, to consider that sacred work, or at lest to treat it as a book of no more
<PB N="4" REF="019364_0003_0FAB4B1E97B82C90"/>
importance than any human persormance; and that, being accustomed in early life to repeat it often, and many times with the utmost reluctance, they imbibe a disgust for it, which their subsequent conviction of its importance, is seldom able to conquer. If therefore the Bible were read two or three times in a week, with that seriousness it deserves, and its precepts explained by the instruc∣tor, merely with a view to impress, upon young minds, moral and religious truths, there is no doubt but such a use would have a more perma∣nent effect upon the principles and conduct of posterity, and the awful solemnities of inspiration would escape profanation, from the levity and wickedness of school-boys.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I subit it these ideas to the feelings of every person. For my part I freely own that I have often shuddered at the sight of thoughtless boys, laughing while they mention the name of Jehovah, and repeating the in∣vitations of divine mercy and the denunciations of infinite wrath, with the same indifference as they would rehearse an unimportant paragraph of a news paper.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the following work, I have endeavoured to make such a collection of essays as should form the morals as well as improve the knowledge of youth.</P>
<P>Of the pieces here selected, some are borrow∣ed from British writers of eminence—some are fugitive American publications—some are taken from the manuscripts of my friends—and a few are my own composition. Whenever I have been indebted to English books I have invariably given credit to the author or compiler.</P>
<P>It is found by experience that Dialogues, as bearing a near resemblance to the common talk
<PB N="5" REF="019364_0004_0FAB4B1F59326C98"/>
of children, are the best calculated to prevent or break ill habits of reading, and to teach them an easy unaffected pronunciation. This will ac∣count for the number admitted into this collec∣tion.</P>
<P>In the choice of pieces, I have not been inat∣tentive to the political interests of America. Se∣veral of those masterly addresses of Congress, written at the commencement of the late revolu∣tion, contain such noble, just and independent sentiments of liberty and patriotism, that I can∣not help wishing to transfuse them into the breasts of the rising generation.</P>
<P>This part completes the system I had proposed to publish for the use of schools. To refine and establish our language, to facilitate the acquisi∣tion of grammatical knowledge, and diffuse the principles of virtue and patriotism, is the task I have laboured to perform; and whether the success should equal my wishes or not, I shall still have the satisfaction of reflecting that I have made a laudable effort to advance the happiness of my country.</P>

<HEAD>RULES FOR READING AND SPEAKING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE I. Let your articulation be clear and distinct.</HEAD>
<P>A GOOD articulation consists in giving every letter and syllable, its proper proportion of sound.</P>
<P>Let each syllable and the letters which com∣pose it, be pronounced with a clear voice, without whining, drawling, lisping, stammering, mum∣bling in the throat or speaking through the nose. Avoid equally a dull, drawling habit and too much rapidity of pronunciation; for each of these faults destroys a distinct articulation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE II. Observe the stops and make the proper pauses, but make no pause where the sense requires none.</HEAD>
<P>The characters we use as stops are extremely ar∣bitrary and do not-always mark a suspension of the voice. On the contrary, they are often employed to separate the several members of a period, and show the grammatical construction. Nor when they are designed to mark pauses, do they always determine the length of those pauses; for this depends much on the sense and the nature of the subject. A semicolon, for example, requires a longer pause in a grave discourse, than in a lively and spirited declamation. However, as children
<PB N="8" REF="019364_0006_0FAB4B2ED587F680"/>
are incapable of nice distinctions, it may be best to adopt at first some general rule with respect to the pauses,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where the propertion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, colon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is fixed at one, two, four, six.</NOTE> and teach them to pay the same at∣tention to these characters as they do to the words. They should be cautioned likewise against paus∣ing in the midst of a member of a sentence, where the sense requires the words to be closely con∣nected in pronunciation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE III. Pay the strictest attention to accent, emphasis and cadence.</HEAD>
<P>Let the accented syllables be pronounced with a proper stress of voice; the unaccented, with lit∣tle stress of voice, but distinctly.</P>
<P>The important words of a sentence, which I call naturally emphatical, have a claim to a con∣siderable force of voice; but particles, such as, <HI>of, to, as, and,</HI> &amp;c. require no force of utterance, unless they happen to be emphatical, which is rarely the case. No person can read or speak well, unless he understands what he reads; and the sense will always determine what words are emphatical. It is a matter of the highest con∣sequence therefore, that a speaker should clearly comprehend the meaning of what he delivers, that he may know where to lay the emphasis. This may be illustrated by a single example. This short question, <HI>Will you ride to town to day?</HI> is capable of four different meanings, and conse∣quently
<PB N="9" REF="019364_0007_0FAB4B305FFD06A0"/>
quently of four different answers, according to the placing of the emphasis. If the emphasis is laid upon <HI>you,</HI> the question is, whether <HI>you</HI> will ride to town or <HI>another person.</HI> If the emphasis is laid on <HI>ride,</HI> the question is, whether you will <HI>ride</HI> or go on <HI>foot.</HI> If the emphasis is laid on <HI>town,</HI> the question is, whether you will ride to <HI>town</HI> or to <HI>another place.</HI> If the emphasis is laid on <HI>to day,</HI> the question is, whether you will ride <HI>to day</HI> or some <HI>other day.</HI> Thus the whole mean∣ing of a phrase often depends on the emphasis; and it is absolutely necessary that it should be laid on the proper words.</P>
<P>Cadence is a falling of the voice in pronoun∣cing the closing syllable of a period<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">We may observe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good speakers always pronounce upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>; for altho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the voice according to the various ideas they express, yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same pitch of voice. Accent and empha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s require'no elevation of voice, but a more forcible expression on the same key. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> last syllable only of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; which syllable i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a actually pronounced with a lower tone of voice; but when words of several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s close a period, all the syllables but the last, are pronounced on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same key as the rest of the sentence.</NOTE>. This ought not to be uniform; but different at the close of different sentences.</P>
<P>But in interrogative sentences, the sense often requires the closing word or syllable to be pro∣nounced with an elevated voice. This, however, is only when the last word is emphatical; as in this question, "Betravest thou the son of man with a kiss?" Here the subject of enquiry is, whe∣ther the common token of love and benevolence is prostituted to the purpose of treachery; the force of the question depends on the last word, which is therefore to be pronounced with an ele∣vation
<PB N="10" REF="019364_0008_0FAB4B309D7BCE48"/>
of voice. But in this question, "Where is <HI>boasting</HI> then?" the emphatical word is <HI>boasting,</HI> which of course requires an elevation of voice.</P>
<P>The most natural pitch of voice is that in which we speak in ordinary conversation. Whenever the voice is raised above this key, pronunciation is difficult and fatiguing. There is a difference between a <HI>loud</HI> and a <HI>high</HI> voice. A person may speak much <HI>louder</HI> than he does in ordinary dis∣course, without any elevation of voice; and he may be heard distinctly, upon the same key, ei∣ther in a private room or in a large Assembly.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE IV. Let the sentiments you express be accompanied with proper tones, looks and gestures.</HEAD>
<P>By <HI>tones</HI> I mean the various modulations of voice by which we naturally express the emotions and passions. By <HI>looks</HI> I mean the expression of the emotions and passions in the countenance.</P>
<P><HI>Gestures</HI> are the various motions of the hands or body which correspond to the several sentiments and passions which the speaker designs to express.</P>
<P>All these should be perfectly natural. They should be the same which we use in common con∣versation. A speaker should endeavour to feel what he speaks; for the perfection of reading and speaking is, to pronounce the words as if the sen∣timents were our own.</P>
<P>If a person is rehearsing the words of an angry man, he should assume the same furious look, his eyes should slash with rage, his gestures should
<PB N="11" REF="019364_0009_0FAB4B3159733A70"/>
be violent, and his utterance rapid and vehe∣ment. But if he utters the sentiments of bene∣volence and kindness, his countenance should put on a smile, his eye-lids should be drawn nearer to∣gether than usual, and his voice should be soft and inviting: An example of the first we have in these words, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his Angels." An example of the latter, in the fol∣lowing,—"Come, Ye blessed of my father, in∣herit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world." And the person, who pronounces these two sentences with the same voice, looks and gestures, must be a total stranger to the rules of reading and oratory.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe with words all the various passions that affect us; they can be learn∣ed only from observing persons under the opera∣tions of them.</P>
<P>All good speaking must arise from feeling; and when we would utter with propriety the words of another person, we should endeavour as much as possible to put ourselves in his place and make his sentiments our own. If a reader or speaker is not interested in what he says, his pro∣nunciation will <HI>certainly</HI> be without animation, <HI>probably</HI> without propriety.</P>
<P>Let this fundamental rule, therefore, be im∣pressed upon the learner's mind; <HI>That whatever he reads or speaks should be pronounced just as tho' the sentiments were his own.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>TO be very active in laudable pursuits, is the distinguishing characteristic of a man of merit.</P>
<P>There is an heroic innocence, as well as an he∣roic courage.</P>
<P>There is a mean in all things. Even virtue itself has its stated limits; which not being strictly observed, it ceases to be virtue.</P>
<P>It is wiser to prevent a quarrel beforehand, than to revenge it afterwards.</P>
<P>It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly.</P>
<P>No revenge is more heroic, than that which torments envy, by doing good.</P>
<P>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</P>
<P>Money, like manure, does no good till it is spread. There is no real use of riches, except in the distribution; the rest is all conceit.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="019364_0011_0FAB4B32D6CC5978"/>
A wise man will desire no more than what he may get justly, use soberly, distribute cheerfully, and live upon contentedly.</P>
<P>A contented mind, and a good conscience, will make a man happy in all conditions. He knows not how to fear, who dares to die.</P>
<P>There is but one way of fortifying the soul a∣gainst all gloomy presages and terrors of mind; and that is, by securing to ourselves the friend∣ship and protection of that Being who disposes of events, and governs futurity.</P>
<P>Philosophy is then only valuable, when it serves for the law of life, and not for the osten∣tation of science.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WITHOUT a friend the world is but a wilderness.</P>
<P>A man may have a thousand intimate acquain∣tances, and not a friend among them all. If you have one friend, think yourself happy.</P>
<P>When once you profess yourself a friend, en∣deavour to be always such. He can never have any true friends, that will be often changing them.</P>
<P>Prosperity gains friends, and adversity tries them.</P>
<P>Nothing more engages the affections of men, than a handsome address, and graceful conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>Complaisance renders a superior amiable, an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable.</P>
<P>Excess of ceremony shews want of breeding.
<PB N="14" REF="019364_0012_0FAB4B33A881DF80"/>
That civility is best, which excludes all super∣fluous formality.</P>
<P>Ingratitude is a crime so shameful, that the man was never yet found, who would acknow∣ledge himself guilty of it.</P>
<P>Truth is born with us; and we must do vio∣lence to nature, to shake off our veracity.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater treachery, than first to raise a confidence, and then deceive it.</P>
<P>By others' faults, wise men correct their own.</P>
<P>No man hath a thorough taste of prosperity, to whom adversity never happened.</P>
<P>When our vices leave us, we flatter ourselves that we leave them.</P>
<P>It is as great a point of wisdom to hide igno∣rance, as to discover knowledge.</P>
<P>Pitch upon that course of life which is the most excellent; and habit will render it the most delightful.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>CUSTOM is the plague of wise men, and the idol of fools.</P>
<P>As to be perfectly just, is an attribute of the divine nature; to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to the utmost of our abil∣ities, is the glory of man.</P>
<P>No man was ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down with the injuries of fortune, unless he had before suffered himself to be deceived by her favours.</P>
<P>Anger may glance into the breast of a wise man, but rests only in the bosom of fools.</P>
<P>None more impatiently suffer injuries, than
<PB N="15" REF="019364_0013_0FAB4B345882BFF0"/>
those that are most forward in doing them.</P>
<P>By taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy; but in passing it over, he is superior.</P>
<P>To err is human; to forgive, divine.</P>
<P>A more glorious victory cannot be gained o∣ver another man, than this, that when the injury began on his part, the kindness should begin on ours.</P>
<P>The prodigal robs his heir, the miser robs himself.</P>
<P>We should take a prudent care for the future, but so as to enjoy the present. It is no part of wisdom, to be miserable to-day, because we may happen to be so to-morrow.</P>
<P>To mourn without measure is folly; not to mourn at all, insensibility.</P>
<P>Some would be thought to do great things, who are but tools and instruments; like the fool who fancied he played upon the organ, when he only drew the bellows.</P>
<P>Though a man may become learned by ano∣ther's learning, he never can be wise but by his own wisdom.</P>
<P>He who wants good sense is unhappy in ha∣ving learning; for he has thereby more ways of exposing himself.</P>
<P>It is ungenerous to give a man occasion to blush at his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in one thing, who perhaps may excel us in many▪</P>
<P>No object is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing to the eye, than the sight of a man whom you have obliged; nor any music so agreeable to the ear, as the voice of one that owns you for his benefactor.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="019364_0014_0FAB4B462E955AA0"/>
The coin that is most current amongst mankind is flattery; the only benefit of which is, that by hearing what we are not, we may be instructed what we ought to be.</P>
<P>The character of the person who commends you, is to be considered before you set a value on his esteem. The wise man applauds <HI>him</HI> whom he thinks most virtuous, the rest of the world, <HI>him</HI> who is most wealthy.</P>
<P>The temperate man's pleasures are durable, because they are regular; and all his life is calm and serene, because it is innocent.</P>
<P>A good man will love himself too well to lose, and his neighbour too well to win, an estate by gaming. The love of gaming will corrupt the best principles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the world.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AN angry man who suppresses his passions, thinks worse than he speaks; and an angry man that will chide, speaks worse than he thinks.</P>
<P>A good word is an easy obligation; but not to speak ill requires only our silence, which costs us nothing.</P>
<P>It is to affectation the world owes its whole race of coxcombs. Nature in her whole drama never drew such a part; she has sometimes made a fool, but a coxcomb is always of his own mak∣ing.</P>
<P>It is the infirmity of little minds to be taken with every appearance, and dazzled with every thing that sparkles; but great minds have but
<PB N="17" REF="019364_0015_0FAB4B4F4A16B3E0"/>
little admiration, because few things appear new to them.</P>
<P>It happens to men of learning, as to ears of corn; they shoot up, and raise their heads high, while they are empty; but when full, and swell∣ed with grain, they begin to flag and droop.</P>
<P>He that is truly polite, knows how to contra∣dict with respect, and to please without adulation; and is equally remote from an insipid complai∣sance, and a low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amiliarity.</P>
<P>The failings of good men are commonly more published in the world than their good deeds; and one fault of a deserving man, shall meet with more reproaches, than all his virtues, praise: such is the force of ill will, and ill nature.</P>
<P>It is harder to avoid censure, than to gain ap∣plause; for this may be done by one great or wise action in an age; but to escape censure, a man must pass his whole life without saying or doing one ill or foolish thing.</P>
<P>When Darius offered Alexander ten thou∣sand talents to divide Asia equally with him, he answered, the earth cannot bear two suns, nor Asia, two kings. Parmenio, a friend of Alexan∣der's, hearing the great offers Darius had made, said, were I Alexander, I would accept them. So would I, replied Alexander, were I Parmenio.</P>
<P>Nobility is to be considered only as an imagi∣nary distinction, unless accompanied with the practice of those generous virtues by which it ought to be obtained. Titles of honour confer∣red upon such as have no personal me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, are at best but the royal stamp set upon base metal.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="019364_0016_0FAB4B4F574DD200"/>
Though an honourable title may be conveyed to posterity, yet the ennobling qualities which are the soul of greatness are a sort of incommunica∣ble perfections, and cannot be transferred. If a man could bequeath his virtues by will, and fet∣tle his sense and learning upon his heirs, as cer∣tainly as he can his lands, a noble descent would then indeed be a valuable privilege.</P>
<P>Truth is always consistent with itself, and needs nothing to help it out. It is always near at hand, and sits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware: whereas a lie is troublesome, and sets a man's invention upon the rack; and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>The pleasure which affects the human mind with the most lively and transporting touches, is the sense that we act in the eye of infinite wis∣dom, power, and goodness, that will crown our virtuous endeavours here with happiness hereaf∣ter, large as our desires, and lasting as our im∣mortal souls; without this, the highest state of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e is insipid, and with it, the lowest is a paradise.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>HONOURABLE age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor which is mea∣sured by number of years; but wisdom is the grey hair unto man, and unspotted life is old age.</P>
<P>Wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with consci∣ence, always forecasteth evil things: for fear is
<PB N="19" REF="019364_0017_0FAB4B50E3C0C178"/>
nothing else, but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.</P>
<P>A wise man will fear in every thing. He that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little.</P>
<P>A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends; but a poor man being down is thrust away by his friends; when a rich man is fallen he hath many helpers; he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet men justify him; the poor man slipt and they rebuked him; he spoke wise∣ly, and could have no place. When a rich man speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and look, what he saith they extol it to the clouds; but if a poor man speak, they say, what fellow is this?</P>
<P>Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from it, and hath not passed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor been bound in her bonds; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and the bands thereof are bands of brass; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e death thereof is an evil death.</P>
<P>My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither use uncomfortable words, when thou givest any thing. Shall not the dew assuage the heat? so is a word better than a gift. Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man.</P>
<P>Blame not, before thou hast examined the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> understand first, and then rebuke.</P>
<P>If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first
<PB N="20" REF="019364_0018_0FAB4B51C0D45760"/>
and be not hasty to credit him; for some men are friends for their own occasions, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.</P>
<P>Forsake not an old friend, for the new is not compareable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old thou shalt drink it with pleasure.</P>
<P>A friend cannot be known in prosperity; and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity.</P>
<P>Admonish thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he hath, that he do it no more. Admonish thy friend; it may be he hath not said it, or if he hath, that he speak it not again. Ad∣monish a friend; for many times it is a slander; and believe not every tale. There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?</P>
<P>Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind.</P>

<P>THE latter part of a wise man's life is taken up in curing the follies, prejudices, and false opinions he had contracted in the former.</P>
<P>Censure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent.</P>
<P>Very few men, properly speaking, live at pre∣sent, but are providing to live another time.</P>
<P>Party is the madness of many, for the gain of a few.</P>
<P>To endeavour to work upon the vulgar with fine sense, is like attempting to hew blocks of marble with a razor.</P>
<P>Superstition is the spleen of the soul.</P>
<P>He who tells a lie is not sensible how great a task he undertakes; for he must be forced to in∣vent twenty more to maintain that one.</P>
<P>Some people will never learn any thing, for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ason, because they understand every thing too soon.</P>
<P>There is nothing wanted to make all rational and disinterested people in the world of one reli∣gion, but that they should talk together every day.</P>
<P>Men are grateful, in the same degree that they are resentful.</P>
<P>Young men are subtle arguers; the cloak of
<PB N="22" REF="019364_0020_0FAB4B532494CEA0"/>
honour covers all their faults, as that of passion all their follies.</P>
<P>Economy is no disgrace; it is better living on a little, than out-living a great deal.</P>
<P>Next to the satisfaction I receive in the pros∣perity of an honest man, I am best pleased with the confusion of a rascal.</P>
<P>What is often termed shyness, is nothing more than refined sense, and an indifference to common observations.</P>
<P>Every person insensibly fixes upon some degree of refinement in his discourse, some measure of thought which he thinks worth exhibiting. It is wise to fix this pretty high, although it occa∣sions one to talk the less.</P>
<P>To endeavour all one's days to fortify our minds with learning and philosophy, is to spend so much in armour, that one has nothing left to defend.</P>
<P>Deference often shrinks and withers as much upon the approach of intimacy, as the sensitive plant does upon the touch of one's finger.</P>
<P>Men are sometimes accused of pride, merely because their accusers would be proud themseves if they were in their places.</P>
<P>People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quently use this expression, I am in∣cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to think so and so, not considering that they are speaking the most literal of all truths.</P>
<P>Modesty makes large amends for the pain it gives the persons who labour under it, by the prejudice it affords every worthy person in their favour▪</P>
<P>The difference there is betwixt honour and
<PB N="23" REF="019364_0021_0FAB4B53E15F0F70"/>
honesty seems to be chiefly in the motive. The honest man does that from duty, which the man of honour does for the sake of character.</P>
<P>A liar begins with making falshood appear like truth, and ends with making truth itself appear like falshood.</P>
<P>Virtue should be considered as a part of taste; and we should as much avoid deceit, or sinister meanings in discourse, as we would puns, bad language, or false grammar.</P>
<P>The higher character a person supports, the more he should regard his minutest actions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>DEFERENCE is the most complicate, the most indirect, and the most elegant of all compliments.</P>
<P>He that lies in bed all a summer's morning, loses the pleasure of the day: he that gives up his youth to indolence, undergoes a loss of the same kind.</P>
<P>Shining characters are not always the most a∣greeable ones. The mild radiance of an eme∣rald, is by no means less pleasing than the glare of the ruby.</P>
<P>To be at once a rake, and to glory in the char∣acter, discovers at the same time a bad dispositi∣on, and a bad taste.</P>
<P>How is it possible to expect that mankind will take advice, when they will not so much as take warning.</P>
<P>Although men are accused for not knowing
<PB N="24" REF="019364_0022_0FAB4B54D33B1880"/>
their own weakness, yet perhaps as few know their own strength. It is in men as in soils, where sometimes there is a vein of gold which the own∣er knows not of.</P>
<P>Fine sense and exalted sense are not half so va∣luable as common sense. There are forty men of wit for one man of sense; and he that will car∣ry nothing about him but gold, will be every day at a loss for want of ready change.</P>
<P>Learning is like mercury, one of the most powerful and excellent things in the world in skilful hands; in unskilful, most mischievous.</P>
<P>A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but saying, in other words, that he is wiser to-day than he was yesterday,</P>
<P>Wherever I find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, I take it sor granted there would be as much generosity if he were a rich man.</P>
<P>Flowers of rhetoric in sermons or serious dis∣courses, are like the blue and red flowers in corn, pleasing to those who come only for amusement, but prejudicial to him who would reap the profit.</P>
<P>It often happens that those are the best people, whose characters have been most injured by slanderers; as we usually find that to be the sweetest fruit, which the birds have been pecking at.</P>
<P>The eye of a critic is often like a microscope, made so very fine and nice, that it discovers the atoms, grains, and minutest articles, without ever comprehending the whole, comparing the parts, or seeing all at once the harmony.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="019364_0023_0FAB4B56AA2DB2F0"/>
Men's zeal for religion is much of the same kind as that which they shew for a foot-ball: whenever it is contested for, every one is ready to venture their lives and limbs in the dispute; but when that is once at an end, it is no more thought on, but sleeps in oblivion, buried in rubbish, which no one thinks it worth his pains to rake in∣to, much less to remove.</P>
<P>Honour is but a fictious kind of honesty; a mean, but a necessary substitute for it, in socie∣ties which have none: it is a sort of paper-credit, with which men are obliged to trade, who are de∣ficient in the sterling cash of true morality and religion.</P>
<P>Persons of great delicacy should know the cer∣tainty of the following truth: there are abun∣dance of cases which occasion suspense, in which whatever they determine they will repent of their determination; and this through a propensity of human nature to fancy happiness in those schemes which it does not pursue.</P>
<P>The chief advantage that ancient writers can boast over modern ones seems owing to simpli∣city. Every noble truth and sentiment was ex∣pressed by the former in a natural manner, in word and phrase simple, perspicuous, and inca∣pable of improvement. What then remained for late writers, but affectation, witticism, and con∣ceit?</P>

<L>OH, world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,</L>
<L>Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,</L>
<L>Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise,</L>
<L>Are still together; who twine (as 'twere) in love</L>

<P>He that would pase the latter part of his life, with honour and decency, must, when is <HI>young</HI> consider that he shall one day be <HI>old,</HI> and remem∣ber, when he is <HI>old,</HI> that he has once been <HI>young.</HI></P>
<P>An old age, unsupported with matter for dis∣cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and meditation, is much to be dreaded. No state can be more destitute than that of him, who, when the delights of sense forsake him, has no pleasures of the mind.</P>
<P>Such is the conditon of life that something is always wanted, to happiness. In youth we have warm hopes, which are soon blasted by rashness and negligence, and great designs, which are de∣feated
<PB N="31" REF="019364_0029_0FAB4B5E5BB36E40"/>
by inexperience. In age we have know∣ledge and prudence, without spirit to exert, or motives to prompt them. We are able to plan schemes and regulate measures, but have not time remaining to bring them to completion.</P>
<P>A varice is always poor, but poor by her own fault.</P>
<P>The maxim which Periander of Corinth, one of the seven sages of Greece, left as a memorial of his knowledge and benevolence, was, "Be master of your anger." He considered anger as the great disturber of human life; the chief ene∣my both of public happiness and private tran∣quility, and thought he could not lay on posteri∣ty a stronger obligation to reverence his memory, than by leaving them a falutary caution against this outrageous passion.</P>
<P>Pride is undoubtedly the origin of anger; but pride, like every other passion, if it breaks loose from reason, counteracts its own purposes. A passionate man, upon the review of his day, will have very few gratifications to offer to his pride, when he has considered how his outrages were caused; why they were borne, and in what they are likely to end at last.</P>
<P>Whilst an author is yet living, we estimate his powers by the worst performance. When he is dead, we rate them by his best.</P>
<P>It requires but little acquaintance with the heart, to know that woman's first wish is to be handsome; and that consequently the readiest method of obtaining her kindness is to praise her beauty.</P>

The universal axiom in which all complaisance is included, and from which flow all the formali∣ties which custom has established in civilized na∣tions, is,—"That no man should give any pre∣ference to himself,"—a rule so comprehensive and certain, that perhaps it is not easy for the mind to imagine an incivility without supposing it to be broken.</P>
<P>Charity would lose its name were it influenced by so mean a motive as human praise.</P>
<P>That charity is best of which the consequences are most extensive.</P>
<P>Those who raise envy will easily in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur censure. Cheats can seldom stand long against laughter. What cannot be repaired is not to be regretted. The state of the mind oppressed with a sudden calamity is like that of the fabulous inhabitants of the new created earth. who, when the first night came on, supposed that day would never return.</P>
<P>There is a kind of anxious cleanliness, which is always the characteristic of a slattern; it is the superfluous scrupulosity of guilt, dreading disco∣very and shunning suspicion.—It is the violence of an effort against habit, which being impelled by external motives, cannot stop at the middle point.</P>
<P>The foundation of content must spring up in a man's own mind; and he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing any thing but his own disposition, will waste his life in fruitless efforts, and multi∣ply the griefs which he purposes to remove.</P>
<P>No rank in life precludes the efficacy of a well∣timed

<P>The crime which has been once committed, is committed again with less reluctance.</P>
<P>The great disturbers of our happiness in this world, are our desires, our griefs, and our fears; and to all these the <HI>consideration of mortality</HI> is a certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and adequate remedy. "Think (says Epictetus) frequently on poverty, banishment, and death, and thou wilt never indulge violent de∣sires, or give up thy heart to mean sentiments."</P>
<P>It is remarkable that death increases our vene∣ration for the good, and extenuates our hatred of the bad.</P>
<P>To neglect at any time preparation for death, is to sleep on our post at a siege; but to omit it in old age, is to sleep at an attack.</P>
<P>To die is the fate of man; but to die <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lingering anguish, is generally his folly.</P>
<P>To rejoice in tortures is the privilege of mar∣tyrs—to meet death with intrepidity is the right only of innocence (if in any human being inno∣cence can be found); but of him whose life is shortened by his crimes, the last duties are humi∣lity and self-abasement.</P>
<P>Death is no more than every being must suffer, though the dread of it is peculiar to man.</P>
<P>He that too much refines his delicacy, will al∣ways endanger his quiet.</P>
<P>The certainty that life cannot be long, and the probability that it will be much shorter than na∣ture

allows, ought to awaken every man to the active prosecution of whatever he is desirous to perform. It is true, that no diligence can ascer∣tain success; death may intercept the swiftest career, but he who is cut off in the execution of an honest undertaking, has at left the honour of falling in his rank and has fought the battle, though he missed the victory.</P>
<P>Timorous thoughts, and cartious disquisitions, are the dull attendants of delay.</P>
<P>Deceit and falshood, whatever conveniences they may for a time promise or produce, are, in the sum of life, obstacles to happiness. Those who profit by the cheat distrust the deceiver, and the act by which kindness was sought puts an end to confidence.</P>
<P>When we act according to our duty, we com∣mit the event to him by whose laws our actions are governed, and who will suffer none to be fi∣nally punished for obedience. But when in pros∣pect of some good, whether natural or moral, we break the rules prescribed to us, we withdraw from the direction of superior wisdom, and take all consequences upon ourselves.</P>

<P>Without frugality none can be rich, and with it, very few would be poor.</P>
<P>Though in every age there are some, who, by bold adventures or by favourable accidents, rise suddenly into riches; the bulk of mankind must owe their affluence to small and gradual profits, below which their expence must be resolutely reduced.</P>

<P>The great art of life is to play for much, and stake little.</P>

It is observed, that a corrupt society has many laws.</P>
<P>A zeal, which is often thought and called li∣berty, sometimes disguises from the world, and not rarely from the mind which it possesses, an envious desire of plundering wealth, or degra∣ding greatness; and of which the immediate ten∣dency is innovation and anarchy, or imperious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agerness to subvert and confound, with very lit∣tle care what shall be established.</P>

<P>The infelicities of marriage are not to be urg∣ed against its institution, as the miseries of life would prove equally, that life cannot be the gift of heaven.</P>

<P>The misery of man proceeds not from any single crush of overwhelming evil, but from small vexations continually repeated.</P>
<P>Merriment is always the effect of a sudden im∣pression; the jest which is expected is already destroyed.</P>
<P>To improve the golden moment of opportu∣nity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life. Many wants are suffered which might have once been supplied, and much time is lost in regretting the time which had been lost before.</P>
<P>Pleasure is very seldom found where it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought; our brightest blazes of gladness are com∣monly kindled by unexpected sparks. The flow∣ers which scatter their odours from time to time in the paths of life, grow up without culture from seeds scattered by chance.</P>
<P>The great source of pleasure is variety. Uni∣formity must tire at last, though it be uniformity of excellence. We love to expect, and when ex∣pectation is disappointed, or gratified we want to be again expecting.</P>
<P>Compositions, merely pretty, have the fate of other pretty things, and are quitted in time for something useful. They are flowers fragrant and fair, but of short duration; or they are blos∣soms only to be valued as they foretell fruits.</P>

<P>Faction seldom leaves a man honest, however it may find him.</P>
<P>Praise is so pleasing to the ear of man, that it is the original motive of almost all our actions.</P>
<P>That praise is worth nothing of which the price is known.</P>
<P>The real satisfaction which praise can afford, is when what is repeated aloud, agrees with the whispers of conscience, by shewing us that we have not endeavoured to deserve well in vain.</P>
<P>To be at once in any great degree <HI>loved</HI> and <HI>praised</HI> is truly rare.</P>
<P>Pride is a vice, which pride itself inclines every man to find in others, and to overlook in himself.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. AGATHOCLES and CALISTA.</HEAD>
<P>CALISTA was young and beautiful, endowed with a great sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of wit and solid sense. A∣gathocles, whose age very little exceeded her's, was well made, brave and prudent. He had the good fortune to be introduced to Calista's: where his looks, wandering indifferently over a numer∣ous circle, soon distinguished and fixed upon her.</P>
<P>But recovering from the short extacy occasion∣ed by the first sight, he immediately reproached himself, as being guilty of rudeness to the rest of the company; a fault which he had endeavoured to correct, by looking round on other objects. Vain attempts! they were attracted by a power∣ful charm, and turned again towards Calista. He blushed as well as she, while a sweet emotion, till then unselt, produced a kind of fluttering in his heart, and confusion in his countenance.</P>
<P>They both became at the same time, more ti∣mid, and more curious. He was pleased with gaz∣ing at Calista; which he could not do without trembling: whilst Calista, secretly satisfied with this flattering preference, cast her eyes on him by stealth. They were both under an apprehension, but especially Calista, of being caught by the o∣ther in the fact; and yet caught they were almost every moment.</P>
<P>The hour of separation came, which to them appeared too sudden: melancholy were the re∣flections they made on the rapidity of of time. Imagination, however, did not permit, them to be
<PB N="46" REF="019364_0044_0FAB4B7DD82751B0"/>
entirely absent from each other: for the image of Calista was deeply engraved on the mind of Agathocles: and his features were as strongly impressed on that of Calista. They both appear∣ed less cheerful, the rest of the day. A lively sentiment, which they did not well comprehend themselves, entirely employed their minds, in spite of every attempt to divert themselves.</P>
<P>Two days passed without seeing one another again: and, tho' this interval of time had been filled up either by business or recreations; yet they both, notwithstanding, experienced a wea∣riness and dissatisfaction in their minds, for which they could no way account. But the moment, which brought them together again, explained it to them: the perfect contentment they felt in each other's company, made them sensible of the real source of their melancholy.</P>
<P>Agathocles took more courage that day: he addressed Calista in a most obliging manner, and had the happiness to converse with her for the first time. As yet he had seen only her outward charms; but now he discovered the beauty of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her sentiments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what charmed him the most, was the opinion he con∣ceived that she did not judge him unworthy of her esteem.</P>
<P>From this time he made her frequent visits, in every one of which he discovered some new per∣fection in the fair Calista. This is the character∣istic of true merit; it gains by being exposed to the eye of a judicious person. A man of sense
<PB N="47" REF="019364_0045_0FAB4B7EB7700FF8"/>
will soon dislike a coquette, a fool, or a giddy woman: but if he falls in love with a woman of merit, time, far from weakening, will only strengthen and augment his passion.</P>
<P>The fixed inclination of Agathocles convinc∣ed him now that what he felt for Calista, was love, and that of the most tender nature. This he knew; but Calista did not as yet know it, or at lest had not learnt it from his lips. Love is ti∣merous and diffident. A bold suitor is not the real lover of the lady whom he addresses: he seeks for nothing but pleasure. Agathocles at last resolved to open his heart to Calista; but he did not do it in the affected language of a roman∣tic passion. "Lovely Calista, said he ingenuously, it is not mere esteem that binds me to you, but a most passionate and tender love. I feel that I cannot live without you: can you without vio∣lence to your inclinations, consent to make me happy? I may love you without offence; 'tis a tribute due to your merit: but may I flatter my∣self with the hopes of some small return?"</P>
<P>A coquette would have affected to be displeas∣ed at such a declaration. But Calista not only listened to her lover without interrupting him, but answered him without ill-nature, and gave him leave to hope. Nor did she put his constan∣cy to a tedious trial: the happiness for which he sighed was no longer delayed than was necessary to prepare the ceremony. The marriage settle∣ments were easily regulated betwixt the parties: for interest was out of the question: the chief ar∣ticle consisted in the mutual exchange of hearts; which was already fulfilled.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="019364_0046_0FAB4B7F62AEEBE8"/>
What will be the lot of this new-married cou∣ple? The happiest, I may venture to foretel, that mortals can enjoy upon earth. No pleasures are compareable to those that affect the heart; and there are none, as I have observed before, that affect it with such exquisite delight, as loving and being beloved. To this tender union we can ne∣ver apply the words of Democratus, that <HI>the plea∣sure of love is but a short epilepsy.</HI> He meant, with∣out doubt, that mere sensual pleasure, which has so little in it of the nature of love, that a man may enjoy it without loving, and love without ever enjoying it.</P>
<P>They will be constant in their love. This I dare also to predict; and I know the reason. Their affection is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty: they are both the friends of virtue; they love each other on this account; they will, therefore, continue to love, as long as they are virtuous; and their union itself is a pledge of their perseverance: for nothing so much fecures our continuance in the paths of virtue, as to have perpetually before our eyes the example of a person whom we love.</P>
<P>Nothing is capable to disturb their happiness, but those disasters and misfortunes, from which their love cannot shelter them. But, supposing such a reverse of fortune, would not their fate in this regard be common with that of the rest of mankind? Those who have never tasted the plea∣sures of love, are not exempt from the like casual∣ties; and the lover is, at lest, a gainer in regard to those pleasures, which constitute no small part of the happiness of life.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="019364_0047_0FAB4B822498AAE8"/>
Besides, even love itself will greatly diminish the sense of their misfortunes. For love has the peculiar property of alleviating the sufferings of two fond hearts, and of rendering their pleasures more exquisite. By this communication of dis∣tress, they seem to divide its weight: and, on the contrary, by participation their satisfaction is doubled. As a squadron of horse is with greater difficulty broke thro' by the enemy, in propor∣tion to its closeness: so the happy pair resists the attacks of adversity with so much the more strength and success, as they are more closely unit∣ed.</P>

<BIBL>MIRROR, NO. 42, 43, 44.</BIBL>
<P>MORE than forty years ago, an English phi∣losopher, whose works have since been read and admired by all Europe, resided at a little town in France. Some disappointments in his native country had first driven him abroad, and he was afterward induced to remain there, from having found, in his retreat, where the connections even of nation and language were avoided, a perfect seclusion and retirement, highly favourable to the developement of abstract subjects, in which he excelled all the writers of his time.</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps in the structure of such a mind, the finer and more delicate sensibilities are seldom

known to have place, or, if originally implanted there, are in a great measure extinguished by the exertions of intense study and profound investi∣gations. Hence the idea of philosophy and un∣feelingness being united, has become proverbial, and in common language, the former word is of∣ten used to express the latter. Our philosopher has been censured by some, as deficient in warmth and feeling; but the mildness of his manners has been allowed by all▪ and it is certain that if he was not easily melted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compassion, it was, at lest, not difficult to awaken his benevolence.</P>
<P N="3">3. One morning. while he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at busied in those speculations which afterwards astonished the world, an old female domestic, who served him for a housekeeper, brought him word, that an el∣derly gentleman and his daughter had arrived at the village, the preceding evening, on their way to some distant country, and that the father had been suddenly siezed in the night with a dan∣gerous disorder, which the people of the inn, where they lodged, feared would prove mortal: That she had been sent for, as having some knowledge of medicine, the village surgeon being then absent; and that it was truly piteous to see the good old man, who seemed not so much af∣fected by his own distress, as by that which it caused to his daughter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Her master laid aside the volume in his hand, and broke off the chain of ideas it had in∣spired. His night-gown was exchanged for a coat and he followed his gouvernan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick man's apartment. It was the best in the little
<PB N="51" REF="019364_0049_0FAB4B8DD56F4E00"/>
inn where they lay, but a pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry one notwith∣standing. Our philosopher was obliged to stoop as he entered it. It was floored with earth, and above were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not plastered, and hung with cobwebs.</P>
<P N="5">5. On a shock-bed, at one end, lay the old man whom he came to visit; at the foot of it sat his daughter. She was dressed in a clean white bed-gown; her dark locks hung loosely over it as she bent forward, watching the languid looks of her father. The philosopher and his house∣keeper had stood some moments in the room without the young lady's being sensible of their entering it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mademoiselle! said the old woman at last, in a soft tone. She turned, and showed one of the finest faces in the world. It was touched not spoiled with sorrow; and when she perceiv∣ed a stranger, whom the old woman now intro∣duced to her, a blush at first, and then the gentle ceremonial of native politeness, which the afflic∣tion of the time tempered, but did not extinguish, crossed it for a moment and changed its expressi∣on. It was sweetness all, however, and our philosopher felt it strongly.</P>
<P N="7">7. It was not a time for words; he offered his services in a few sincere ones. "Monsieur lies miserably ill here," said the gouvernante; "If he could possibly be moved any where." "If he could be moved to our house," said her master. He had a spare bed for a friend, and there was a great room unoccupied next to the gouvernante's. It was contrived accordingly.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="52" REF="019364_0050_0FAB4B8E6D1E6270"/>
8. The scruples of the stranger, who could look scruples, tho' he could not speak them, were overcome, and the bashful reluctance of his daughter gave way to her belief of its use to her father. The sick man was wrapt in blankets and carried across the street to the English gen∣tleman's. The old woman helped the daughter to nurse him there. The surgeon, who arrived soon after, prescribed a little and nature did much for him; in a week he was able to thank his be∣nefactor.</P>
<P N="9">9. By that time his host had learned the name and character of his guest. He was a protestant and clergyman of Switzerland, called <HI>La Roche,</HI> a widower, who had lately buried his wife, after a long and lingering illness, for which travelling had been prescribed; and was now returning home, after an ineffectual journey, with his only child, the daughter we have mentioned.</P>
<P N="10">10. He was a devout man, as became his pro∣fession. He possessed devotion in all its warmth, but with none of its asperity; I mean that asperi∣ty which men, who are called devout, sometimes indulge. The philosopher, tho' he felt no devo∣tion, never quarrelled with it in others. His gou∣vernante joined the old man and his daughter, in the prayers and thanksgivings which they put up on his recovery; for she too was a heretic, in the phrase of the village.</P>
<P N="11">11. The philosopher walked out with his long staff and his dog, and left them to their prayers and thanksgivings. "My master," said the old woman, "alas! he is not a christian; but he is
<PB N="53" REF="019364_0051_0FAB4B8F1FC8CF70"/>
the best of unbelievers."—Not a christian! ex∣claimed Mademoiselle <HI>La Roche,</HI> "yet he saved my father! Heaven bless him for it; I would he were a christian."</P>
<P N="12">12. "There is a pride in human knowledge, my child," said her father, "which often blinds men to the sublime truths of revelation; hence there are opposers of christianity amongmen of virtuous lives, as well as among those of dissipated and licentious characters, Nay, sometimes I have known the latter more easily converted to the true faith than the former, because the fume of passion is more easily dissipated than the mist of false theory and delusive speculation." "But this philosopher" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid his daughter, "alas! my father, he shall be a christian before he dies."</P>
<P N="13">13. She was interrupted by the arrival of their landlord—He took her hand with an air of kind∣ness—She drew it away from him in silence; threw down her eyes to the ground and left the room. "I have been thanking God," said the good <HI>La Roche,</HI> "for my recovery." "That is right," replied his landlord. "I should not wish," continued the old man, hesitatingly, "to think-otherwise; did I not look up with grati∣tude to that Being, I should barely be satisfied with my recovery, as a continuation of life which, it may be, is not a real good. Alas! I may live to wish I had died, that you had left me to die, Sir, instead of kindly relieving me (he clasped the philosopher's hand); but when I look on this renovated being as the gift of the Almighty, I feel a far different sentiment—my heart dilates
<PB N="54" REF="019364_0052_0FAB4B8FE7BE4D18"/>
with gratitude and love to him; it is prepared for doing his will, not as a duty, but as a plea∣sure, and regards every breach of it, not with dis∣approbation, but with horror."</P>
<P N="14">14. "You say right, my dear Sir," replied the Philosopher; "but you are not yet re-estab∣lished enough to talk much—you must take care of your health, and neither study nor preach for some time. I have been thinking over a scheme that struck me to day, when you mentioned your intended departure. I was never is Switzerland; I have a great mind to accompany your daugh∣ter and you into that country. I will help to take care of you by the road; for, as I was your first physician, I hold myself responsible for your cure."</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>La Roche'</HI>s eyes glistened at the proposal; his daughter was called and told of it. She was equally pleased with her father; for they really loved their landlord—not perhaps the less for his infidelity; at lest that circumstance mixed a sort of pity with their regard for him—their souls were not of a mould for harsher feelings—hatred never dwelt with them.</P>
<P N="16">16. They travelled by short stages; for the philosopher was as good as his word, in taking care that the old man should not be fatigued. The party had time to be well acquainted with one another, and their friendship was encreased by acquaintance. <HI>La Roche</HI> found a degree of simplicity and gentleness in his companion, which is not always annexed to the character of a learn∣ed or a wise man.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="55" REF="019364_0053_0FAB4B909D099800"/>
17. His daughter, who was prepared to be afraid of him, was equally undeceived. She found in him nothing of that self-importance which su∣perior parts, or great cultivation of them is apt to confer. He talked of every thing but philoso∣phy and religion; he seemed to enjoy every plea∣sure and amusement of ordinary life, and to be interested in the most common topics of dis∣course; when his knowledge or learning at any time appeared, it was delivered with the utmost plainness and without the lest show of dogma▪∣tism.</P>
<P N="18">18. On his part, he was charmed with the so∣ciety of the good clergyman and his lovely daughter. He found in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the guileless man∣ner of the earliest times, with the culture and ac∣complishments of the most refined ones. Every better feeling, warm and vivid; every ungentle one, repressed or overcome. He was not ad∣dicted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o love; but he felt himself happy, in be∣ing the friend of <HI>Mademoiselle La Roche,</HI> and sometimes envied her father the possession of such a child.</P>
<P N="19">19. After a journey of eleven days, they ar∣rived at the dwelling of <HI>La Roche.</HI> It was situa∣ted in one of those valleys in the canton of Berne, where nature seems to repose in quiet, and has en∣closed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her retreat with mountains inaccessible. A strea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that spent its fury in the hills above, ran in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ont of the house, and a broken water-fall was seen through the woods that covered its sides; below, it circled round a tufted plain, and form∣ed a little lake in front of a village, at the end of
<PB N="56" REF="019364_0054_0FAB4B9191D834F0"/>
which appeared the spire of <HI>La Roche'</HI>s church, rising above a clump of beeches.</P>
<P N="20">20. The philosopher enjoyed the beauty of the scene; but to his companions it recalled the memory of a wife and parent they had lost. The old man's sorrow was silent; his daughter sobb'd and wept. Her father took her hand, kissed it twice, pressed it to his bosom, threw up his eyes to heaven; and having wiped off a tear that was just about to drop from each, began to point out to his guest some of the most striking objects which the prospect afforded. The philosopher interpreted all this; and he could but slightly censure the creed from which it arose.</P>
<P N="21">21. They had not been long arrived, when a number of <HI>La Roche'</HI>s parishioners, who had heard of his return, came to the house to see and wel∣come him. The honest folks were awkward, but sincere, in their professions of friendship. They made some attempts at condolence; it was too delicate for their handling; but <HI>La Roche</HI> took it in good part. "It had pleased God;" said he and they saw he had settled the matter with him∣self. Philosohpy could not have done so much with a thousand words.</P>
<P N="22">22. It was now evening, and the good peasants were about to depart, when a clock was heard to strike seven, and the hour was followed by a par∣ticular chime. The country folks, who came to welcome their pastor, turned their looks towards him at the sound; he explained their meaning to his guest. "That is the signal," said he, "for our evening exercise; this is one of the nights of
<PB N="57" REF="019364_0055_0FAB4B9242E0A9F0"/>
the nights of the week in which some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pa∣rishioners are wont to join in it; a little rustic saloon serves for the chapel of our family, and such of the good people as are with us; if you choose rather to walk out, I will furnish you with an attendant; or here are a few old books which may afford you some entertainment within.</P>
<P N="23">23. "By no means," answered the philoso∣pher; "I will attend Madamoiselle at her de∣votions." "She is our organist," said <HI>La Roche;</HI> "our neighbourhood is the country of musical mechanism, and I have a small organ, fitted up for the purpose of assisting our singing." "'Tis an additional inducement," replied the other, and they walked into the room together.</P>
<P N="24">24. At the end stood the organ mentioned by <HI>La Roche;</HI> before it was a curtain, which his daughter drew aside, and placing herself on a seat within, and drawing the curtain close, so as to save her the awkwardness of an exhibition, began a voluntary, solemn and beautiful in the highest degree. The philosopher was no musician, but he was not altogether insensible to music; this fastened on his mind more strongly, from its beauty being unexpected.</P>
<P N="25">25. The solemn prelude introduced a hymn, in which such of the audience as could sing im∣mediately joined; the words were mostly taken from holy writ; it spoke the praises of God and his care of good men. Something was said of the death of the just; of such as die in the Lord. The organ was touched with a hand, less firm;—it paused;—it ceased;—and the sobbing of Ma∣demoiselle was heard in its stead.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="58" REF="019364_0056_0FAB4B960A32A050"/>
26. Her father gave a sign for stopping the psalmody, and rose to prayer. He was discom∣posed at first and his voice faltered as he spoke; but his heart was in his words, and its warmth overcame his embarrassment. He addressed a Being whom he loved, and he spoke for those he loved. His parishioners catched the ardour of the good old man; even the philosopher felt him∣self moved, and forgat, for a moment, to think why he should not.</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>La Roche'</HI>s religion was that of sentiment, not theory, and his guest was averse from dispu∣tation; their discourse did not therefore lead to questions concerning the belief of either; yet would the old man sometimes speak of his, from the feelings of a heart impressed with its force and wishing to spread the pleasure he enjoyed in it. The ideas of his God, and his Saviour were so congenial to his mind, that every emotion of it naturally awakened them. A philosopher might have called him an enthusiast; but if he possessed the fervour of enthusiasts, he was guilt∣less of their bigotry. "Our Father who art in heaven!" might the good old man say—for he felt it—and all mankind were his brethren.</P>
<P N="28">28. "You regret, my friend," said he to the philosopher, "when my daughter and I talk of the exquisite pleasure derived from music; you regret your want of musical powers and musical feelings; it is a department of soul, you say, which nature has almost denied you, which, from the effects you see it have on others, you are sure must be highly delightful. Why should not the
<PB N="59" REF="019364_0057_0FAB4B9F1C54EA18"/>
same thing be said of religion? Trust me, I feel it in the same way, an energy, an inspiration, which I would not lose for all the blessings of sense, or enjoyments of the world; yet so far from lessening my relish of the pleasures of life, that I feel it heightens them all."</P>
<P N="29">29. "The thought of receiving it from God, adds the blessing of sentiment to that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensation in every good thing which I possess; and when calamities overtake me, and I have had my share, it confers such a dignity on my affliction, and so lifts me above the world. Man, I know is but a worm, yet methinks I am then allied to God!" It would have been inhuman in our philosopher to cloud, even with a doubt, the sunshine of his belief.</P>
<P N="30">30. His discourse, indeed, was very remote from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disquisition or religious con∣troversy. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> I ever knew, his ordinary conversation was the lest tinctured with pedantry, or liable to dissertation. With <HI>La Roche</HI> and his daughter, it was perfectly familiar.</P>
<P N="31">31. The country round them, the manners of the village, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comparison of both with those of England, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the works of favourite au∣thors, on the sentiments they conveyed and the passions they excited, with many other topics in which there was an equality, or alternate advan∣tage, among the speakers, were the subjects they talked on.</P>
<P N="32">32. Their hours too of riding and walking were many, in which the philosopher, as a stranger, was shown the remarkable scenes and curiosities of the
<PB N="60" REF="019364_0058_0FAB4BA0B62C2DE8"/>
country. They would sometimes make little ex∣peditions to contemplate, in different attitudes, those astonishing mountains, the cliffs of which, covered with eternal snows, and sometimes shoot∣ing into fantastic shapes, form the termination of most of the Swiss prospects.</P>
<P N="33">33. Our philosopher asked many questions, as to their natural history and productions. <HI>La Roche</HI> observed the sublimity of the ideas which the view of their stupendous summits, inaccessi∣ble to mortal foot, was calculated to inspire, which, said he, naturally leads the mind to that Being by whom their foundations were laid,—"They are not seen in Flanders!" said Mada∣moiselle with a sigh. "That is an odd remark," said the philosopher, smiling.—She blushed and he enquired no farther.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The philosopher was a resident in Flanders and a skeptic. This reproof of his infidelity is inimitably delicate. In short this whole story <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a beautiful satire on deism, bigotry and metaphysical theology, while it paints unaffected virtue, benevolence and piety in the most engaging colours.</NOTE></P>
<P N="34">34. It was with regret he left a society in which he found himself so happy; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> settled with <HI>La Roche</HI> and his daughter a plan of correspond∣ence: and they took his promise, that, if ever he came within fifty leagues of their dwelling, he would travel those fifty leagues to visit them.</P>
<P N="35">35. About three years after, our philosopher was on a visit at Geneva; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he made to <HI>La Roche</HI> and his daughter, on his former vi∣sit, was recalled to his mind, by the view of that range of mountains, on a part of which they had often looked together. There was a reproach too,
<PB N="61" REF="019364_0059_0FAB4BA1194D5350"/>
conveyed along with the recollection, for his hav∣ing failed to write to either of them for several months past. The truth was, that indolence was the habit most natural to him, from which he was not easily roused by the claims of correspondence, either of his friends or his enemies; when the latter drew their pens in controversy, they were often answered as well as the former.</P>
<P N="36">36. While he was hesitating about a visit to <HI>La Roche,</HI> which he wished to make, but found the effort rather too much for him, he received a let∣ter from the old man, which had been forwarded to him from Paris, where he had then fixed his residence. It contained a gentle complaint of the Philosopher's want of punctuality, but an as∣surance of continued gratitude for his former good offices, and, as a friend whom the writer considered interested in his family, it informed him of the approaching nuptials of Mademoiselle <HI>La Roche,</HI> with a young man, a relation of her own and formerly a pupil of her father's, of the most noble dispositions and respectable character.</P>
<P N="37">37. Attached from their earliest years, they had been separated by his joining one of the subsidiary regiments of the Canton, then in the service of a foreign power. In this situation, he had distin∣guished himself as much for courage and military skill, as for the other endowments which he had cultivated at home. The term of his service was now expired and they expected him to re∣turn in a few weeks, when the old man hoped, as he expressed it in his letter, to join their hands and see them happy before he died.</P>
<P N="38"><PB N="62" REF="019364_0060_0FAB4BA1DD4921A0"/>
38. Our philosopher felt himself interested in this event; but he was not, perhaps, altogether so happy in the tidings of Mademoiselle <HI>La Roche's</HI> marriage, as her father supposed him. Not that he ever was a lover of the Lady; but he thought her one of the most amiable women he had seen, and there was something in the idea of her being another's for ever, that struck him, he knew not why, like a disappointment. After some little speculation on the matter, however, he could look on it as a thing fitting, if not quite agreeable, and determined on his visit to see his old friend and his daughter happy.</P>
<P N="39">39. On the last day of his journey, different ac∣cidents had retarded his progress; he was be∣nighted before he reached the quarter in which <HI>La Roche</HI> resided. His guide however, was well acquainted with the road and he found himself in view of the lake, which I have before described, in the neighbourhood of <HI>La Roche's</HI> dwelling. A light gleamed on the water, that seemed to proceed from the house; it moved slowly along as he proceeded up the side of the lake and at last he saw it glimmering through the trees and stop at some distance from the place where he then was.</P>
<P N="40">40. He supposed it some piece of bridal merri∣ment, and pushed on his horse that he might be a spectator of the scene; but he was a good deal shocked, on approaching the spot, to find it pro∣ceeded from the torch of a person clothed in the dress of an attendant on a funeral, and accompa∣nied by several others, who like him, seemed to
<PB N="63" REF="019364_0061_0FAB4BA2976D44C8"/>
have been employed in the rites of sepulture.</P>
<P N="41">41. On the philosopher's making enquiry who was the person they had been burying? one of them, with an accent more mournful than is common to their profession, answered, "Then you knew not Mademoiselle, Sir! you never beheld a lovlier." <HI>La Roche!"</HI> exclaimed he in reply"—"Alas it was she indeed!" The ap∣pearance of grief and surprise which his counte∣nance assumed, attracted the notice of the pea∣sant with whom he talked.</P>
<P N="42">42. He came up close to the philosopher—"I preceive, Sir, you were acquainted with Ma∣demoiselle <HI>La Roche."</HI> "Acquainted with her: Good God! when—how—where did she die? Where is her father." "She died, Sir, of heart∣break, I believe; the young gentleman to whom she was soon to be married, was killed, in a duel by a French Officer, his intimate companion, and to whom, before their quarrel, he had often done the greatest favours▪"</P>
<P N="43">43. "Her worthy father bears her death, as he has often told us a Christian should; he is even so composed as to be now in his pulpit, ready to deliver a few exhortations to his parishioners, as is his custom with us on such occasions. Follow me, Sir, and you shall hear him." He followed the man without answering.</P>
<P N="44">44. The Church was dimly lighted, except near the pulpit, where the venerable <HI>La Roche</HI> was seated. His people were now lifting up their voices to that being whom their pastor had taught them ever to bless and revere. <HI>La Roche</HI> sat, his figure bending gently forward, his eyes half-closed
<PB N="64" REF="019364_0062_0FAB4BA35AA5E258"/>
lifted up in silent devotion. A lamp pla∣ced near him, threw its light strongly on his head and marked the shadowy lines of his age across the paleness of his brow, thinly covered with grey hairs.</P>
<P N="45">45. The music ceased,—<HI>La Roche</HI> sat for a moment and nature wrung a few tears from him. His people were loud in their grief. The philo∣sopher was not less affected then they. <HI>La Roche</HI> arose. "Father of mercies" I said he, "forgive these tears; assist thy servant to lift up his soul to thee; to lift to thee the souls of thy people! My friends! it is good so to do; at all seasons it is good; but in the days of our distress, what a pri∣vilege it is! Well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith the sacred book, "Trust in the Lord; at all times trust in the Lord." When every other support fails us, when the fountains of worldly comfort are dried up, let us then seek those living waters which flow from the throne of God. It is only from the belief of the goodness and wisdom of a supreme Being that our calamities can be borne in the manner which becomes a man."</P>
<P N="46">46. "Human wisdom is here of little use; for in proportion as it bestows comfort, it represses feeling, without which we may cease to be hurt by calamity, but we shall also cease to enjoy happi∣ness. I will not bid you be insensible, my friends! I cannot, I cannot, if I would (his tears flowed afresh) I feel too much myself, and I am not a∣shamed of my feelings; but therefore, may I the more willingly be heard; therefore have I prayed God to give me strength to speak to you;
<PB N="65" REF="019364_0063_0FAB4BA41B570218"/>
to direct you to him, not with empty words, but with these tears; not from speculation, but from experience,—that while you see me suffer, you may know also my consolation."</P>
<P N="47">47. "You behold the mourner of his only child, the last earthly stay and blessing of his de∣clining years! Such a child too! it becomes not me to speak of her virtues; yet it is but grate∣ful to mention them, because they were exerted towards myself. Not many days ago you saw her young, beautiful, virtuous, and happy; ye who are parents will judge of my felicity then, you will judge of my afflictions now. But I look to∣wards him who struck me; I see the hand of a father amidst the chastenings of my God."</P>
<P N="48">48. "Oh! could I make you feel what it is to pour out the heart, when it is pressed down with many sorrows, to pour i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out with confidence to him, in whose hands are life and death, on whose power awaits all that the first enjoys, and in con∣templation of whom disappears all that the last can inflict! For we are not as those who die with∣out hope; we know that our redeemer liveth,—that we shall live with him, with our friends his servants, in that blessed land where sorrow is un∣known, and happiness as endless as it is perfect."</P>
<P N="49">49. "Go then, mourn not for me; I have not lost my child: but a little while and we shall meet again, never to be separated. But ye are also my children: Would ye that I should not grieve without comfort? So live as she lived; that when your death shall come, it may be the death of the righteous, and your latter end like his."</P>
<P N="50"><PB N="66" REF="019364_0064_0FAB4BA6A73E3038"/>
50. Such was the exortation of <HI>La Roche;</HI> his audience answered it with tears. The good old man had dried up his at the altar of the Lord; his countenance had lost its sadness and assumed the glow of faith and hope. The philosopher followed him into his house. The inspir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the pulpit was past; the scenes, they had last met in, rushed again on his mind; <HI>La Roche</HI> threw his arms around his neck and watered it with his tears. The other was equally affected; they went together in silence into the parlour, where the evening service was wont to be performed.</P>
<P N="51">51. The curtains of the organ were open; <HI>La Roche</HI> started back at the sight.—"Oh my friend," said he and his tears burst forth again. The philosopher had now recollected himself; he stept forward and drew the curtain close—the old man wiped off his tears and taking his friend by the hand, "You see my weakness," and he, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the weakness of humanity; but my comfort is not therefore lost." "I heard you," said the other, "in the pulpit; I rejoice that such consolation is yours." It is my friend," said he, "and I trust I shall ever hold it fast; if there are any who doubt our faith, let them think of what impor∣tance religion is to calamity and forbear to weak∣en its force; if they cannot restore our happi∣ness let them not take away the solace of our af∣fliction."</P>
<P N="52">52. The philosopher's heart was smitten: and I have heard him, long after, confess, that these were moments when the remembrance overcame him even to weakness; when, amidst all the
<PB N="67" REF="019364_0065_0FAB4BB1F7337840"/>
pleasures of philosophical discovery, and the pride of literary fame, he called to his mind the venerable figure of the good <HI>La Roche</HI> and wished that he had never doubted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Story of Sir EDWARD and LOUISA.</HEAD>
<BIBL>MIRROR, No.108, 109.</BIBL>
<P>IF we examine impartially that estimate of plea∣sure, which the higher ranks of society <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to form, we shall probably be surprised to find how little there is in it, either of natural feeling or real satisfaction. Many a fashionable volup∣tuary, who has not totally blunted his taste or his judgement, will own, in the intervals of recol∣lection, how often he has suffered from the insipi∣dity or the pain of his enjoyments; and that, if it were not for the fear of being laughed at, it would sometimes be worth while, even on the score of pleasure, to be virtuous.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> to whom I had the pleasure of being introduced at Florence, was a character much beyond that which distinguishes the gene∣rality of English travellers of fortune.</P>
<P>His story was known to some of his country∣men who then resided in Italy; from one of whom, who could now and then talk of something besides pictures and operas, I had a particular recital of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. He had been abroad at an early period of
<PB N="68" REF="019364_0066_0FAB4BB349510668"/>
life, soon after the death of his father had left him master of a very large estate, which he had the good fortune to inherit, and all the inclinati∣on natural to youth to enjoy. Though always sumptuous, however, and sometimes profuse, he was observed never to be ridiculous in his ex∣penses; and though he was now and then talk∣ed of as a man of pleasure and dissipation, he al∣ways left behind him more instances of benefi∣cence, than of irregularity.</P>
<P N="4">4. For that respect and esteem in which his character, amidst all his little errors, was general∣ly held, he was supposed a good deal indebted to the society of a gentleman who had been his companion at the university, and now attended him rather as a friend than a tutor. This gentle∣man was unfortunately seized at Marseilles with a lingering disorder, for which he was under the necessity of taking a sea-voyage, leaving Sir <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> to prosecute the remaining part of his in∣tended tour alone.</P>
<P N="5">5. Descending into one of their valleys of Piedmont, where notwithstanding the ruggedness of the road, Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> with a prejudice natu∣ral to his country, preferred the conveyance of an English hunter to that of an Italian mule, his horse unluckily made of false step and fell with his rider to the ground, from which Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was lifted by his servants with scarce any signs of life. They conveyed him on a litter to the nearest house, which happened to be the dwelling of a peasant rather above the common rank, before whose door some of his neighbours were assem∣bled
<PB N="69" REF="019364_0067_0FAB4BBB11743748"/>
at a scene of rural merriment, when the train of Sir <HI>Edward</HI> brought up their master in the condition I have described.</P>
<P N="6">6. The compassion, natural to his situation, was excited in all; but the owner of the mansion, whose name was <HI>Venoni,</HI> was particularly moved with it. He applied himself immediately to the care of the stranger, and with the assistance of his daughter, who had left the dance she was engag∣ed in, with great marks of agitation, soon restor∣ed Sir <HI>Edward</HI> to sense and life.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Venoni</HI> possessed some little skill in surgery and his daughter produced a book of receipts in medicine. Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> after being blooded, was put to bed and tended with every possible care by his host and his family. A considerable degree of fever was the consequence of his acci∣dent; but after some days it abated: and in lit∣tle more than a week, he was able to join in the society of <HI>Venoni</HI> and his daughter.</P>
<P N="8">8. He could not help expressing some surprise at the appearance of refinement in the conversati∣on of the latter, much beyond what her situation seemed likely to confer. Her father accounted for it. She had received her education in the house of a Lady, who happened to pass through the valley, and to take shelter in <HI>Venoni'</HI>s cottage (for his house was but a better sort of cottage) the night after her birth.</P>
<P N="9">9. "When her mother died," said he, "the Signora, whose name, at her desire, we had given the child, took her home to her own house; there she was taught many things of which there is no
<PB N="70" REF="019364_0068_0FAB4BBBAAB136E8"/>
need here; yet she is not so proud of her learn∣ing as to wish to leave her father in his old age; and I hope soon to have her settled near me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or life."</P>
<P N="10">10. But Sir <HI>Edward</HI> had now an opportunity of knowing <HI>Louisa</HI> better than from the descripti∣on of her father. Music and painting, in both which arts she was a tolerable proficient, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> had studied with success. <HI>Louisa</HI> felt a sort of pleasure from her drawings, which they had never given her before, when they were praised by Sir <HI>Edward;</HI> and the family concerts of <HI>Venoni</HI> were very different from what they had formerly been, when once his guest was so far re∣covered as to be able to join in them. The flute of <HI>Venoni</HI> excelled all the other music of the val∣ley; his daughter's lute was much beyond it; Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s violin was finer than either.</P>
<P N="11">11. But his conversation with <HI>Louisa</HI>—It was that of a superior order of beings! science, taste, sentiment! it was long since <HI>Louisa</HI> had heard these sounds; amidst the ignorance of the valley, it was luxury to hear them; from Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> who was one of the most engaging figures I ever saw, they were doubly delightful. In his coun∣tenance there was always an expression animated and interesting; his sickness had overcome some∣what of the first, but greatly added to the power of the latter.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Louisa'</HI>s was no less captivating and Sir <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> had not beheld it so long without emotion. During his illness, he thought this emotion but gra∣titude, and when it first grew warmer, he checked
<PB N="71" REF="019364_0069_0FAB4BBC2E951450"/>
it, from the thought of her situation and of the debt he owed her. But the struggle was too ineffectu∣al to overcome, and of consequence increased, his passion.</P>
<P N="13">13. There was but one way in which the pride of Sir <HI>Edward</HI> allowed of its being gratified. He sometimes thought of this as base and unworthy; but he was the fool of words which he had often despised, the slave of manners which he had of∣ten condemned. He at last compromised mat∣ters with himself; he resolved, it he could, to think no more of <HI>Louisa:</HI> at any rate, to think no more of the ties of gratitude or the restraints of virtue.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Louisa,</HI> who trusted to both, now commu∣nicated to Sir E<HI>dward</HI> an important secret. It was at the close of a piece of music, which they had been playing in the absence of her father. She took up her lute and touched a little wild melancholy air, which she had composed to the memory of her mother. "That," said she, "no∣body ever heard except my father; I play it some∣times when I am alone and in low spirits. I know not how I came to think of it now; yet I have some reason to be sad."</P>
<P N="15">15. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> pressed to know the cause; after some hesitation she told it all. Her father had fixed on the son of a neighbour, rich in pos∣sessions, but rude in manners, for her husband. Against this match she had always protested as strongly, as a sense of duty and the mildness of her nature would allow; but <HI>Venoni</HI> was obstinately bent on the match, and she was wretched from the
<PB N="72" REF="019364_0070_0FAB4BBCE21B6E18"/>
thoughts of it. "To marry where one cannot love,—to marry such a man, Sir <HI>Edward!"</HI> It was an opportunity beyond his power of resistance. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> pressed her hand; said it would be profanation to think of such a marriage; prais∣ed her beauty, extolled her virtues; and con∣cluded by swearing that he adored her.</P>
<P N="16">16. She heard him with unsuspecting pleasure, which her blushes could ill conceal. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> improved the favourable moment; talked of the ardency of his passion, the insignificancy of cere∣monies and forms, the inefficacy of legal engage∣ments, the eternal duration of those dictated by love; and in fine, urged her going off with him, to crown both their days with happiness. <HI>Louisa</HI> started at the proposal. She would have reproach∣ed him, but her heart was not made for it; she could only weep.</P>
<P N="17">17. They were interrupted by the arrival of her father with his intended son-in-law. He was just such a man as <HI>Louisa</HI> had represented him, coarse, vulgar and ignorant. But <HI>Venoni,</HI> tho' much above their neighbour in every thing but riches, looked on him as poorer men often look on the wealthy, and discovered none of his im∣perfections. He took his daughter aside, told her he had brought her future husband, and that he intended they should be married in a week at farthest.</P>
<P N="18">18. Next morning <HI>Louisa</HI> was indisposed, and kept her chamber. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was now per∣fectly recovered. He was engaged to go out with <HI>Venoni;</HI> but before his departure, he took
<PB N="73" REF="019364_0071_0FAB4BBDD705B128"/>
up his violin and touched a few plaintive notes on it. They were heard by <HI>Louisa.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. In the evening she wandered forth to in∣dulge her sorrows alone. She had reached a se∣questered spot, where some poplars formed a thicket, on the banks of a little stream that wa∣tered the valley. A nightingale was perched on one of them and had already begun its accustom∣ed song. <HI>Louisa</HI> sat down on a withered stump, leaning her cheek upon her hand.</P>
<P N="20">20. After a little while, the bird was scared from its perch, and flitted from the thicket. <HI>Lou∣isa</HI> rose from the ground and burst into tears! She turned, and beheld Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> His coun∣tenance had much of its former langour; and when he took her hand, he cast on the earth a melancholy look and seemed unable to speak his feelings.</P>
<P N="21">21. "Are you not well Sir <HI>Edward?"</HI> said <HI>Louisa,</HI> with a voice faint and broken. "I am ill indeed" said he, "but my illness is of the mind. <HI>Louisa</HI> cannot cure me of that. I am wretched; but I deserve to be so. I have broken every law of hospitality and every obligation of gratitude. I have dared to wish for happiness and to speak what I wished, though it wound∣ed the heart of my dearest benefactor—but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will make a severe expiation."</P>
<P N="22">22. "This moment I leave you, <HI>Louisa!</HI> I go to be wretched; but you may be happy; happy in your duty to a father, happy, it may be, in the arms of a husband, whom the possession of such a wise may teach refinement and sensibility. I
<PB N="74" REF="019364_0072_0FAB4BBE559FDF98"/>
go to my native country, to hurry through scenes of irksome business or tasteless amusements; that I may, if possible, procure a sort of half-oblivion of that happiness which I left behind, a listless en∣durance of that life which I once dreamed might be made delightful with <HI>Louisa."</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. Tears▪ were the only answer she could give. Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s servants appeared, with a carriage, ready for his departure. He took from his pocket two pictures; one he had drawn of <HI>Louisa,</HI> he fastened it round his neck, and kissing it with rapture, hid it in his bosom. The other he held out in a hesitating manner. "This," said he, "if <HI>Louisa</HI> will accept of it, may some∣times put her in mind of him who once offended, who can never cease to adore her. She may look on it perhaps after the original is no more; when this heart shall have forgot to love and ceased to be wretched."</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Louisa</HI> was at last overcome. Her face was first pale as death; then suddenly, it was crossed with a crimson blush. "Oh! Sir <HI>Edward!"</HI> said she, "what—what would you have me do!" He eagerly seized her hand and led her, reluctant, to the carriage. They entered it and driving off with furious speed, were soon out of sight of those hills which pastured the flocks of the unfortunate <HI>Venoni.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. The virtue of <HI>Louisa</HI> was vanquished; but her sense of virtue was not overcome. Nei∣ther the vows of eternal fidelity of her seducer, nor the constant and respectful attention, which he paid her, during a hurried, journey to England, could
<PB N="75" REF="019364_0073_0FAB4BBF1CF8D308"/>
allay that anguish which she suffered at the recol∣lection of her past, and the thoughts of her pre∣sent situation. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> felt strongly the pow∣er of her beauty and of her grief. His heart was not made for that part which, it is probable, he thought it could have performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was still sub∣ject to remorse, to compassion and to love.</P>
<P N="26">26. These emotions perhaps, he might soon have overcome, had they been met by vulgar vi∣olence or reproaches; but the quiet and up∣braiding sorrows of <HI>Louisa</HI> nourished those feel∣ings of tenderness and attachment. She never mentioned her wrongs in words; sometimes a few starting tears would speak them; and when time had given her a little more composure, her lute discoursed melancholy music.</P>
<P N="27">27. On their arrival in England, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> carried <HI>Louisa</HI> to his seat in the country. There she was treated with all the observance of a wife; and, had she chosen it, might have commanded more than the ordinary splendor of one. But she would not allow the indulgence of Sir <HI>Edward</HI> to blazen with equipage, and show that state which she wished always to hide, and, if possible, to for∣get. Her books and her music were her only pleasure; if pleasure they could be called, that served but to alleviate misery, and, to blunt, for a while, the pangs of contrition.</P>
<P N="28">28. These were deeply aggravated by the recol∣lection of her father; a father left in his age to feel his own misfortunes and his daughter's disgrace. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was too generous not to think of pro∣viding for <HI>Venoni.</HI> He meant to make some atone∣ment
<PB N="76" REF="019364_0074_0FAB4BBFD493FD78"/>
for the injury he had done him, by that cruel bounty which is reparation only to the base, but to the honest, is insult. He had not, howe∣ver, an opportunity of accomplishing his pur∣pose.</P>
<P N="29">29. He learned that <HI>Venoni,</HI> soon after his daughter's elopement, removed from his former place of residence, and as his neighbours had reported, had died in one of the village of Savoy. His daughter felt this with anguish the most poignant, and her affliction, for a while, refused consolation. Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s whole tenderness and attention were called forth to mitigate her grief; and after its first transports had subsided, he car∣ried her to London in hopes that objects new to her and commonly attractive to all, might con∣tribute to remove it.</P>
<P N="30">30. With a man possessed of feelings like Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s, the affliction of <HI>Louisa</HI> gave a certain respect to his attentions. He hired her a house separate from his own, and treated her with all the delicacy of the purest attachment. But his solicitude to comfort and amuse her was not at∣tended with success. She felt all the horrors of that guilt which she now considered, as not only the ruin of herself, but the murderer of her father.</P>
<P N="31">31. In London Sir <HI>Edward</HI> found his sister, who had married a man of great fortune and high fashion. He had married her, because she was a fine woman, and admired by fine men; she had married him, because he was the wealthi∣est of her suitors. They lived, as is common to
<PB N="77" REF="019364_0075_0FAB4BC5D4B33D78"/>
people in such a situation, necessitous with a princely revenue, and very wretched amidst per∣petual gaiety.</P>
<P N="32">32. This scene was so foreign from the idea Sir <HI>Edward</HI> had formed of the reception which his country and his friends were to afford him, that he found a constant source of disgust in the society of his equals. In their conversation fan∣tastic, not refined, their ideas were frivolous and their knowledge, shallow; and with all the pride of birth and insolence of station, their principles were mean and their minds ignoble. In their pretended attachments, he discovered only de∣signs of selfishness; and their pleasures, he ex∣perienced, were as fallacious as their friendships.</P>
<P N="33">33. In the society of <HI>Louisa</HI> he found sensibi∣lity and truth; hers was the only heart that seemed interested in his welfare: she saw the re∣turn of virtue in Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> and felt the friend∣ship which he shewed her. Sometimes, when she perceived him sorrowful, her lute would leave its melancholy for more lively airs, and her coun∣tenance assumed a gaiety it was not formed to wear. But her heart was breaking with that anguish which her generosity endeavoured to conceal from him; her frame, too delicate for the struggle of her feelings, seemed to yield to their force; the colour faded in her cheek, the lustre of her eyes grew dim.</P>
<P N="34">34. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> saw these symptoms of decay with the deepest remorse. Often did he curse those false ideas of pleasure, which had led him to consider the ruin of an artless girl, who loved
<PB N="78" REF="019364_0076_0FAB4BC69BB47FB0"/>
and trusted him, as an object which it was luxury to attain. Often did he wish to blot out from his life a few guilty months, to be again restored to an opportunity of giving happiness to that family, whose unsuspecting kindness he had re∣paid with the treachery of a robber, and the cru∣elty of an assassin.</P>
<P N="35">35. One evening, while he sat in a little parlour with <HI>Louisa,</HI> his mind alternately agitated and softened with this impression, a <HI>hand-organ</HI> of a remarkable sweet tone, was heard in the street; <HI>Louisa</HI> laid aside her lute and listened: the airs it played were those of her native country, and a few tears which she endeavoured to hide, stole from her on hearing them. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> ordered a servant to fetch the organist into the room: he was brought in accordingly and seated at the door of the apartment.</P>
<P N="36">36. He played one or two sprightly tunes, to which <HI>Louisa</HI> had often danced in her infancy: she gave herself up to the recollection, and her tears flowed without control. Suddenly the mu∣sician changing the stop, introduced a little me∣lancholy air of a wild and plaintive kind. <HI>Louisa</HI> started from her seat and rushed up to the strang∣er.—He threw off a tattered and black patch. It was her father! she would have sprung to em∣brace him; he turned aside for a few moments and would not receive her into his arms. But nature at last overcame his resentment; he burst into tears and pressed to his bosom his long-lost daughter.</P>
<P N="37">37. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> stood fixed in astonishment
<PB N="79" REF="019364_0077_0FAB4BCA9E990200"/>
and confusion.—"I come not to upbraid you," said <HI>Venoni;</HI> "I am a poor, weak, old man, un∣able for upbraidings; I am come but to find my child, to forgive her, and to die! When you saw us first, Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> we were not thus. You found us virtuous and happy; we danced and we sung, and there was not a sad heart in the valley where we dwelt. Yet we left our dancing, our songs and our cheerfulness; you were distressed and we pitied you."</P>
<P N="38">38. "Since that day the pipe has never been heard in <HI>Venoni'</HI>s fields; grief and sickness have brought him almost to the grave; and his neigh∣bours who loved and pitied him, have been cheerful no more. Yet methinks though you robbed <HI>us</HI> of happiness, <HI>you</HI> are not happy;—else why that dejected look, which, amidst all the grandeur around you, I saw you wear, and those tears which under all the gaudiness of her apparel, I saw that poor deluded girl shed?"</P>
<P N="39">39. "But she shall shed no more," cried Sir <HI>Ed∣ward;</HI> "you shall be happy and I will be just. For∣give, my venerable friend, the injuries I have done you; forgive me, my <HI>Louisa,</HI> for rating your excel∣lence at a price so mean. I have seen those high-born females to which my rank might have allied me; I am ashamed of their vices and sick of their fol∣lies. Profligate in their hearts amidst affect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> purity, they are slaves to pleasure, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sincerity of passion and with the name of honour, are insensible to the feelings of virtue."</P>
<P N="40">40. "You may <HI>Louisa!</HI> but I will not call up recollections that might render me less worthy of
<PB N="80" REF="019364_0078_0FAB4BCC6EDD2D58"/>
your future esteem—Continue to love your <HI>Ed∣ward;</HI> but a few hours and you shall add the <HI>ti∣tle,</HI> to the <HI>affections</HI> of a wife; let the care and ten∣derness of a husband bring back its peace to your mind, and its bloom to your cheek. We will leave for a while the wonder and envy of the fa∣shionable circle here. We will restore your fa∣ther to his native home; under that roof I shall once more be happy; happy without alloy, because I shall deserve my happiness. Again shall the pipe and the dance gladden the valley, and inno∣cence and peace beam on the Cottage of <HI>Venoni!</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. EMILIUS, or Domestic Happiness.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of a family depends on such various and opposite principles, that it is a matter of extreme delicacy. Perhaps there is no situation in life in which it is so difficult to be∣have with propriety, as in the contest between <HI>pa∣rental authority</HI> and <HI>parental love.</HI> This is un∣doubtedly the reason why we see so few happy fa∣milies. Few parents are both loved and respect∣ed, because most of them are either the dupes or the tyrants of their children.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some parents, either from a natural weak∣ness of mind, or an excess of fondness, permit and even encourage their children in a thousand little familiarities, which render them ridiculous and by diminishing the respect which is due to their age and station, destroy all their authority. Others, ruled by a partial and blind affection,
<PB N="81" REF="019364_0079_0FAB4BCCC16C97F0"/>
which can deny nothing to its object, indulge their children in all their romantic wishes, how∣ever trifling and foolish; however degrading to their dignity or injurious to their welfare. Others, soured by misfortunes, or grown peevish and jealous by the loss of youthful pleasures, and an acquainta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce with the deceit and the folly of the world, attempt to restrain the ideas and the en∣joyments of youth by the rigid maxims of age.</P>
<P N="3">3. The children of the first class often offend by silly manners and a kind of good-natured dis∣respect. Those of the second, are generally proud, whimsical and vitious. Those of the third, if they are subdued, when young, by the rigour of parental discipline, forever remain morose illibe∣ral and unsociable; or if, as it commonly hap∣pens, they find means to escape from restraint, they abandon themselves to every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>species of li∣centiousness. To parents of these descriptions may be added another class, whose fondness blinds their eyes to the most glaring vices of their chil∣dren; or invents such palliations as to prevent the most salutary corrections.</P>
<P N="4">4. The taste for amusements in young people is, of all others, the most difficult to regulate by the maxims of prudence. In this article, pa∣rents are apt to err, either by extreme indulgence on one hand or immoderate rigour on the other. Recollecting the feelings of their youth, they give unbounded licence to the inclinations of their children; or having lost all relish for amuse∣ments, they refuse to gratify their most moderate desires.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="82" REF="019364_0080_0FAB4BCD9BC5C1A8"/>
5. It is a maxim which universally holds true, that the best method of guarding youth from <HI>criminal</HI> pleasures, is to indulge them freely in those that are <HI>innocent.</HI> A person who has free access to reputeable society, will have little incli∣nation to frequent that which is vitious. But those, who are kept under constant restraint, who are seldom indulged in amusements, who are per∣petually awed by the frowns of a parent, or sour∣ed by a disappointment of their most harmless wishes, will at times break over all bounds to gratify their taste for pleasure, and will not be anxious to discriminate between the innocent and the criminal.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nothing contributes more to keep youth within the limits of decorum, than to have their superiors mingle in their company, at proper times, and participate of their amusements. This condescension flatters their pride; at the same time, that respect for age, which no familiarities can wholly efface, naturally checks the extrava∣gant sallies of mirth, and the indelicate rudenesses which young people are apt to indulge in their jovial hours.</P>
<P N="7">7. That awful distance at which some parents keep their children, and their abhorrence of all juvenile diversions, which compel youth to sa∣crifice their most innocent desires, or veil the gra∣tification of them with the most anxious secrecy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> direct a tendency to drive young persons into a profligate life, as the force of vitious ex∣amples. It is impossible to give, to the age of <HI>twenty,</HI> the feelings or the knowledge of <HI>sixty;</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="019364_0081_0FAB4BCE2ADBD510"/>
as it would be folly to wish to clothe a child with grey hairs, or to stamp the fading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> autumn on the bloom of May. Nature has giv∣en to every age some peculiar passions and ap∣petites; to moderate and refine these, not to stifle and destroy, is the business of common pru∣dence and parental care.</P>
<P N="8">8. I was led into this train of reflections by an acquaintance with the family of Emilius, which is a rare instance of domestic felicity. Parents in∣dulgent to their children, hospitable to their friends and universally respected; their sons equal∣ly generous, modest and manly; Emilia, an on∣ly daughter, the pride of her parents, possessed of every accomplishment that can honour herself, or endear her to her friends; an easy fortune and a disposition to enjoy and improve it to the purposes of humanity; perfect harmony in domestic life and unaffected satisfaction in the pleasures of so∣ciety: Such is the family of Emilius.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such a family is a little paradise on earth; to envy their happiness is almost a virtue. Con∣jugal respect, parental tenderness, filial obedience and brotherly kindness are so seldom united, in a family, that when I am honoured with the friend∣ship of such, I am equally ambitious to participate their happiness and profit by the example.</P>
<P N="10">10. Emilia's situation must be peculiarly a∣greeable. Her parents delight to gratify her in every amusement; and contented with this, she knows no wish beyond the sacred bounds of ho∣nour. While, by their indulgence, she enjoys e∣very rational pleasure, she rewards their generous
<PB N="84" REF="019364_0082_0FAB4BCEE3B92FF8"/>
care, by a dutiful behaviour and unblemished manners.</P>
<P N="11">11. By thus discharging the reciprocal duties of their respective stations, the happiness of each is secured. The solicitude of the parent and the obedience of the child, equally contribute to the bliss of the little society; the one calling forth every act of tenderness, and the other displayed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the filial virtues.</P>
<P N="12">12. Few families are destined to be so happy as that of Emilius. Were I to choose the situa∣tion where I could pass my life with most satis∣faction, it would be in this domestic circle. My house would then be the residence of delight, unmingled with the anxieties of ambition or the regret of disappiontment. Every act would be dictated by love and respect; every countenance would wear the smile of complacence; and the little unavoidable troubles, incident to the hap∣pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> situation, would only serve to increase our friendship and improve our felicity, by making room for the exercise of virtue.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. EMILIA, or the Happiness of Retirement.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was conversing with Emilia, a few days past, I asked her whether she was content∣ed to live so remote from the resort of company. She answered in the affirmative, and remarked further, that her situation enabled her to distin∣guish between <HI>real</HI> friends and <HI>complimentary;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="019364_0083_0FAB4BCF9F9BE758"/>
for if she lived in a more public place, she might be visited by crouds of people, who were civil in∣deed, but had no motive for calling on them, but to spend an idle hour and gaze at the busy multitude.</P>
<P N="2">2. I was pleased with the remark, and was na∣turally led to consider such a retired situation as a fortunate circumstance for a young Lady of delicacy. Not only the happiness of a family, but the character of young women, both in a mo∣ral and social view, depends on a choice of pro∣per company. But this is not all. The frequen∣cy of company, especially if it furnishes a variety of new objects, has a pernicious effect on the dis∣positions of female minds.</P>
<P N="3">3. Women are destined by nature to preside over domestic affairs. Whatever parade they may make abroad, their <HI>real</HI> merit and <HI>real</HI> char∣acters are known only at home. The behaviour of servants, the neatness of furniture, the order of a table and the regularity of domestic business, are the decisive evidences of female worth. Per∣haps sweetness of temper does not contribute more to the happiness of their partners and their families, than a proper attention to these articles.</P>
<P N="4">4. For this reason, whatever has a tendency to divert the mind from these concerns and give them a turn for empty show, endless noise, and tasteless amusements, ought to be carefully avoid∣ed by young Ladies, who wish for respect beyond the present moment. Misses, who are perpetu∣ally surrounded with idle company, or even live in sight of it, though they may be fortunate e∣nough to preserve their innocence, are still in
<PB N="86" REF="019364_0084_0FAB4BD06D4D2718"/>
hazard of contracting such a fondness for dissipa∣tion and folly, as to unfit them for the superin∣tendance of a family.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such women, if they ever marry, must be unhappy themselves, or render their families so. To indulge their former taste for pleasure, they must necessarily neglect the duties of their station, and leave their families without a mistress; or if they attempt to discharge those duties, it must be at the expense of their prevailing desires—a sacrifice that must produce at lest a temporary disquietude in their own minds.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another danger to which young women, possessed of personal charms, are exposed in pub∣lic places, is the flattery and admiration of men. The good opinion of a fop will hardly flatter a woman of discernment; much less their ordinary compliments which are commonly without mean∣ing. But the heart is often so disguised, that it is difficult at first to distinguish between a cox∣comb and man of worth; or if it is easy for an accurate observer, yet there is great danger that vanity and inexperience will make young Ladies overlook the distinction.</P>
<P N="7">7. Few minds are effectually secured against the attacks of flattery. It is a poison the more fatal, as it seizes human nature in its weakest part. In youth, when the passions are in full vi∣gour and the judgement feeble, female minds are peculiarly liable to be corrupted by the conta∣gious influence of pretty civilities and affected ad∣miration.</P>
<P N="8">8. With whatever scruples they may at first
<PB N="87" REF="019364_0085_0FAB4BDDCD654688"/>
listen to the praises that are bestowed on their real or pretended charms, a constant strain of flatter∣ing addresses, accompanied with obsequious com∣plaisance, seldom fails of giving them too high an opinion of themselves. They are insensibly led to believe that they are possessed of virtues to which they are really strangers. This belief sa∣tisfies them without attempting any further im∣provement, and makes them to depend, for repu∣tation in life, on good qualities, the fancied ex∣istence of which begins and ends with the false∣hood of customary compliments.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such Ladies, before marriage, are usually vain, pert, affected and silly; and after marriage, haughty disappointed and peevish. The most perfect beauty must fade, and cease to command admiration; but in most instances, the nuptial hour puts a period to that excess of flattering at∣tention, which is the happiness of giddy females. The longest term of admiration must be short; that which depends solely on personal attractions, is often momentary.</P>
<P N="10">10. The more flattery is bestowed upon young Ladies, the less, in general, are they solicitous to acquire virtues which shall ensure respect when admiration shall cease. The more they are prais∣ed in youth, the more they expect it in advanced life, when they have less charms to command it. Thus the excessive complaisance of admirers, which is extremely pleasing at <HI>sixteen,</HI> proves at <HI>forty,</HI> a source of mortification and discontent.</P>
<P N="11">11. I would by no means insinuate that young Ladies ought to be kept total strangers to com∣pany
<PB N="88" REF="019364_0086_0FAB4BDDDB981258"/>
and to rational professions of esteem. It is in company only that they can acquaint themseves with mankind, acquire an easy address, and learn numberless little decor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms which are essential and cannot be taught by precept. Without these, a woman will sometimes deviate from that dig∣nity and propriety of conduct, which, in any situ∣ation will secure the good-will of her friends, and prevent the blushes of her husband.</P>
<P N="12">12. A fondness for company and amusement is blameable only when it is indulged to excess, and permitted to absorb more important concerns. Nor is some degree of flattery always dangerous or useless. The good opinion of mankind we are all desirous to obtain; and to know that we possess it, often makes us ambitious to deserve it.</P>
<P>No passion is given to us in vain; the best ends are sometimes effected by the worst means; and even female vanity, properly managed, may prompt to the most meritorious actions.</P>
<P N="13">13. I should pay Emilia but a very ill com∣pliment to ascribe her virtues to her local situa∣tion; for no person can claim as a virtue what she has been in no danger of losing. But there is no retirement beyond the reach of temptation, and the whole tenor of her conduct proves that her unblemished morals and uniform delicacy proceed from better principles than necessity or accident.</P>
<P N="14">14. She is loved and flattered, but she is not vain; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> company is universally coveted, and yet she has no airs of haughtiness and disdain. Her cheerfulness in company shews that she has
<PB N="89" REF="019364_0087_0FAB4BDEA0BCC490"/>
a relish for society; her contentment at home and attention to domestic concerns, are early spe∣cimens of her happy disposition; and her decent unaffected abhorrence of every species of licenti∣ous behaviour, evinces, beyond suspicion, that the innocence of her heart is equal to the charms of her person.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Character of JULIANA.</HEAD>
<P>JULIANA is one of those rare women whose personal attractions have no rivals, but the sweetness of her temper and the delicacy of her sentiments. An elegant person, regular features, a fine complexion, a lively expressive counte∣nance, an easy address, and those blushes of mo∣desty that soften the soul of the beholder; these are her native beauties, which render her the ob∣ject of universal admiration. But when we con∣verse with her, and hear the melting expressions of unaffected sensibility and virtue that flow from her tongue, her personal charms receive new lustre, and irresistibly engage the affections of her acquaintances.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sensible that the great source of all happi∣ness, is purity of morals and an easy conscience, Juliana pays constant and sincere attention to the duties of religion. She abhors the infamous, but fashionable vice of deriding the sacred instituti∣ons of religion. She considers a Lady without virtue as a monster on earth; and every accom∣plishment.
<PB N="90" REF="019364_0088_0FAB4BDF5B05D4D8"/>
without morals, as polite deception. She is neither a hypocrite nor an enthusiast; on the contrary, she mingles such cheerfulness with the religious duties of life, that even her piety carries with it a charm, which insensibly allures the profligate from the arms of vice.</P>
<P N="3">3. Not only the general tenor of her life, but in particular her behaviour at church, evinces the reality of her religion. She esteems it not only criminal in a high degree, but extremely unpo∣lite, to behave with levity in a place con∣secrated to the solemn purposes of devotion. She cannot believe that any person, who is soli∣citous to treat all mankind with civility, can laugh in the temple of Jehovah and treat her great benefactor with heedless neglect.</P>
<P N="4">4. In polite life, the manners of Juliana are peculiarly engaging. To her superiors, she shows the utmost defference and respect; to her equals, the most modest complaisance and civility; while her in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>iors of every rank, experience her kind∣ness and affability. By this conduct she secures the love and friendship of all degrees. No per∣son can despise her, for she does nothing that is re∣diculous; she cannot be hated, for she does in∣jury to none; and even the malevolent whispers of envy are silenced by her modest deportment and generous condescension.</P>
<P N="5">5. Her conversation is lively and sentimental; free from false wit, frivolous minuteness, and af∣fectation of learning. Although her discourse is always under the direction of prudence, yet it appears unstudied; for her good sense always
<PB N="91" REF="019364_0089_0FAB4BE014C352A8"/>
furnishes her with thoughts suited to the subject, and the purity of her mind renders any caution in expressing them almost unnecessary. She will not lead the conversation; much less can she stun the ears of company with perpetual chat or interrupt the discourse of others. But when occa∣sion offers, she acquits herself with ease and grace; without the airs of pertness or the confusion of bashfulness.</P>
<P N="6">6. But if the conversation happens to turn upon the foibles of either sex, Juliana disco∣vers her goodness by her silence or by inventing palliations. She detests every species of slander. She is sensible that to publish and aggravate human errors, is not the way to correct them; and ref∣ormation, rather than infamy, is the wish and the study of her life. Her own amiable example is the severest of all satires upon the faults and the follies of her sex, and goes farther in discounte∣nancing both, than all the censures of malicious detraction.</P>
<P N="7">7. Altho' Juliana possesses every accomplish∣ment that can command esteem and admiration; yet she has neither vanity nor ostentation. Her merit is easily discovered without show and pa∣rade. She considers, that haughtiness and con∣tempt of others, always proceed from meanness; that true greatness is ever accessible; and that self recommendation and blustering pretensions, are but the glittering decorations of empty heads and trifling hearts.</P>
<P N="8">8. However strong may be her desire of use∣ful information or however lively her curiosi∣ty,
<PB N="92" REF="019364_0090_0FAB4BE0D6C331B8"/>
yet she restrains these passions within the bounds of prudence and good breeding. She deems it impertinent to the highest degree, to be prying into the concerns of other people; much more impertinent and criminal does she deem it, to indulge an officious inquisitiveness, for the sake of gratifying private spleen in the propagati∣on of unfavourable truths. So exceedingly deli∣cate is she in her treatment of her fellow creatures, that she will not read a paper or hear a whisper, which a person does not wish to have known, even when she is in no danger of detection.</P>
<P N="9">9. The same delicate attention to the feelings of others regulates her conduct in company. She would not, for the price of her reputation, be found laughing or whispering with one in the company. All nods, grimaces, fly looks and half speeches, the cause of which is not known, are carefully avoided by her and reprobated as the height of ill breeding and the grossest insult to the company. Whenever this happens be∣tween two persons, the rest of the company have a just right to consider themselves the object of their ridicule. But it is a maxim of Juliana, that such conduct is a breach of politeness, which, no oddities or mistakes that happen in public com∣pany, can excuse or palliate.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is very common for persons, who are destitute of certain accomplishments which they admire in other people, to endeavour to imitate them. This is the source of affectation, a fault that infallibly exposes a person to ridicule. But
<PB N="93" REF="019364_0091_0FAB4BEFCE575F18"/>
the ornaments of the heart, the dress and the man∣ners of Juliana, are equally easy and natural. She needs not to assume the <HI>appearance</HI> of good qua∣lities which she possesses in <HI>reality;</HI> nature has given too many beauties to her person, to require the studied embellishments of fashion; and such are the ease and gracefulness of her behaviour, that any attempt to improve them would lessen the dignity of her manners.</P>
<P N="11">11. She is equally a stranger to that superci∣lious importance which affects to despise the small, but necessary concerns of life; and that squeamish false delicacy which is wounded with every trifle. She will not neglect a servant in sickness because of the meanness of his employment; she will not abuse an animal for her own pleasure and amuse∣ment; nor will she go into fits at the distress of a favourite cat.</P>
<P N="12">12 Her gentle soul is never disturbed with dis∣content, envy or resentment; those turbulent passions which so often destroy the peace of soci∣ety as well as of individuals.</P>
<P>The native firmness and serenity of her mind for∣bid the intrusion of violent emotions; at the same time he heart, susceptible and kind, is the soft residence of every virtuous affection. She sustains the unavoidable shocks of adversity, with a calmness that indicates the superiority of her soul; and with the smile of joy or the tear of tender∣ness, she participates the pleasures or the sorrows of a friend.</P>
<P N="13">13. But the discretion and generosity of Julia∣na, are particularly distinguished by the number
<PB N="94" REF="019364_0092_0FAB4BFC592921B0"/>
and sincerity of her attachments. Her friendships are few, but they are all founded on the princi∣ples of benevolence and fidelity. Such confidence do her sincerity, her constancy and her faithful∣ness inspire, that her friends commit to her breast, their most private concerns, without reserve and without suspicion. It is her favourite maxim, that a necessity of exacting promises of secrecy, is a burlesque upon every pretension to friendship. Such is the character of the young, the amiable Juliana. If it is possible for her to find a man who knows her worth and has a disposition and virtues to reward it, the union of their hearts must secure that unmingled felicity in life, which is reserved for genuine love, a passion inspired by sensibility and improved by a perpetual inter∣course of kind offices.</P>

<P>I hope, Madam, you will excuse the boldness of this intrusion, since it is owing to your own behaviour that I am forced to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my behaviour, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You cannot but remember me at Bath, Madam, where I so lately had the favour of your hand.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do remember, Sir, but I little expected a wrong interpretation of my behaviour from one who has so much the appearance of a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I saw of your behaviour was so just, it would admit of no misrepresentation. I only feared, whatever reason you had to conceal your name from me at Bath, you might have the same reason to do it now; and though my hap∣piness was so nearly concerned, I rather chose to venture thus abruptly after you, than be imper∣tinently inquisitive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, there seems to be so much civility in your rudeness, that I can easily forgive it; though I dont see how your happiness is at all concerned.</P>
</SP>

<P>No Madam; I believe you are the only Lady who could, with the qualifications you are mistress of, be insensible of the power they give you over the happiness of our sex.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could you have the lest sense of what I feel whilst I am speaking, you would know me to be in earnest, and what I say to be the dictates of a heart that admires you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, this is carrying the matter too far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I danced with you at Bath, I was charmed with your whole behaviour, and felt the same tender admiration; but my hope of see∣ing you afterwards, kept in my passion, till a more proper time mould offer. You cannot therefore blame me now, if, after having lost you once, I do not suffer an inexcuseable modesty to prevent my making use of a second opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>This behaviour, Sir, is so different from the gaiety of your conversation, then, that I am at a loss how to answer you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing, Madam, which could take off from the gaiety with which your presence inspires every heart, but the fear of losing you. How can I be otherwise than I am, when I know not but you may leave London as abrupt∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you did Bath.</P>

<P>O, why is not some effectual me∣thod contrived to prevent this horrible practice of duelling?</P>

<HEAD>An ADDRESS of Congress to the People of Great Britain, written in September 1774.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW SUBJECTS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN a nation, led to greatness, by the hand of liberty, and possessed of all the
<PB N="154" REF="019364_0152_0FAB49F52B6DFB20"/>
glory that heroism, munificence and humanity can bestow, descends to the ungrateful task of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orging chains for her friends and children, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stead of giving support to freedom, turns ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocate for slavery and oppression, there is reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o suspect she has either ceased to be virtuous, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een extremely negligent in the appointment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er rulers.</P>
<P>In almost every age, in repeated conflicts, and long and bloody wars, as well civil as foreign, against many and powerful nations, against the open assaults of enemies, and the more dangerous treachery of friends, have the inhabitants of your island, your great and glorious ancestors, main∣tained their independence and transmitted the rights of men and the blessings of liberty to you their posterity.</P>
<P>Be not surprized therefore, that we, who are de∣scended from the same common ancestors, that we, whose forefathers participated in all the rights, the liberties and the constitution you so justly boast, and who have carefully conveyed the same fair inheritance to us, guarantied by the plighted faith of government, and the most solemn compacts with British Sovereigns, should refuse to surrender them to men, who found their claims on no prin∣ciples of reason, and who prosecute them with a design that by having <HI>our</HI> lives and property in ther power, they may with the greater facility enslave <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The cause of America is now the object of universal attention: It is at length become very serious. This unhappy country has not only
<PB N="155" REF="019364_0153_0FAB4A0EDA3C33A8"/>
been oppressed, but abused and misrepresented; and the duty we owe to ourselves and posterity, to your interest, and the general welfare of the British empire, leads us to address you on this very important subject.</P>
<P><HI>Know then,</HI> THAT we consider ourselves, and do insist that we are and ought to be, as free as our fellow subjects in Britain, and that no power on earth has a right to take our property from us without our consent.</P>
<P>That we claim all the benefits secured to the subject by the English constitution, and particu∣larly that inestimable one of trial by jury.</P>
<P>That we hold it essential to English liberty, that no man be condemned unheard, or punished for supposed offences, without having an oppor∣tunity to be heard in his defence.</P>
<P>That we think the legislature of Great-Britain is not authorised by the constitution to establish a religion, fraught with sanguinary and impious tenets, or, to erect an arbitrary form of govern∣ment in any quarter of the globe. These rights, we, as well as you, deem sacred. And yet, sacred as they are, they have, with many others been re∣peatedly and flagrantly violated.</P>
<P>Are not the proprietors of the soil of Great-Britain lords of their own property? Can it be taken from them without their consent? Will they yield it to the arbitrary disposal of any man, or num∣ber of men whatever?—You know they will not.</P>
<P>Why then are the proprietors of the soil of America, less lords of their property than you are of your's? or why should they submit it to the dis∣posal
<PB N="156" REF="019364_0154_0FAB4A1185CCB9D8"/>
of your parliament, or any other parliament or council in the world, not of their election? Can the intervention of the sea that divides us, cause disparity in rights, or can any reason be given, why English subjects who live three thousand miles from the royal palace, should enjoy less li∣berty than those who are three hundred miles dis∣tant from it?</P>
<P>Reason looks with indignation on such distinc∣tions, and freemen can never perceive their pro∣priety. And yet however chimerical and unjust such discriminations are, the parliament assert that they have a right to bind us in all cases without exception, whether we consent or not; that they may take end use our property when and in what manner they please; that we are pensioners on their bounty for all that we possess, and can hold it no longer than they vouchsafe to permit. Such declarations we consider as herisies in En∣glish politics, and which can no more operate to deprive us of our property, than the interdicts of the Pope can divest Kings of sceptres, which the laws of the land and the voice of the people have placed in their hands.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the conclusion of the late war—a war ren∣dered glorious by the abilities and integrity of a minister, to whose efforts the British empire owes its safety and its fame:—At the conclusion of this war, which was succeeded by an inglorious peace, formed under the auspices of a minister, of prin∣ciples, and of a family unfriendly to the protestant cause, and inimical to liberty—We say, at this period, and under the influence of that man, a
<PB N="157" REF="019364_0155_0FAB4A12176359B8"/>
plan for enslaving your fellow subjects in Ameri∣ca was concerted, and has ever since been pertina∣ciously carrying into execution.</P>
<P>Prior to this aera, you were content with draw∣ing from us the wealth produced by our com∣merce. You restrained our trade in every way that could conduce to your emolument. You exercised unbounded sovereignty over the sea. You named the ports and nations to which alone our merchandize should be carried, and with whom alone we should trade; and though some of these restrictions were grievous, we nevertheless did not complain; we looked up to you as to our pa∣rent state, to which we were bound by the strong∣est ties; and were happy in being instrumental to your prosperity and your grandeur.</P>
<P>We call upon you yourselves, to witness our loyalty and attachment to the common interest of the whole empire: Did we not, in the last war, add all the strength of this vast continent to the force which repelled our common enemy? Did we not leave our native shores, and meet disease and death, to promote the success of the British arms in foreign climes? Did you not thank us for our zeal, and even re-imburse us large sums of mo∣ney, which, you confessed, we had advanced be∣yond our proportion, and far beyond our abili∣ties? You did.</P>
<P>To what causes then, are we to attribute the sudden change of treatment, and that system of slavery which was prepared for us at the restorati∣on of peace?</P>
<P N="4">4. Before we had recovered from the distresses
<PB N="158" REF="019364_0156_0FAB4A1385AF2F58"/>
which ever attend war, an attempt was made to drain this country of all its money, by the oppres∣sive stamp-act. Paint, Glass, and other commo∣dities, which you would not permit us to pur∣chase of other nations, were taxed; nay, altho' no wine is made in any country, subject to the British state, you prohibited our procuring it of foreign∣ers, without paying a tax, imposed by your par∣liament, on all we imported. These and many other impositions were laid upon us most unjust∣ly and unconstitutionally, for the express purpose of raising a revenue.—In order to silence com∣plaint, it was, indeed, provided, that this revenue should be expended in America for its protecti∣on and defence.—The exactions, however, can receive no justification from a pretended necessity of protecting and defending us. They are lavish∣ly squandered on court favourites, and ministerial dependants generally avowed enemies to Ame∣rica, and employing themselves, by partial repre∣sentations, to traduce and embroil the colonies.</P>
<P N="5">5. For the necessary support of government here, we ever were and ever shall be ready to provide. And whenever the exigencies of the state may re∣quire it, we shall, as we have heretofore done, cheerfully contribute our full proportion of men and money. To enforce this unconstitutional and unjust scheme of taxation, every fence that the wisdom of our British ancestors had carefully erected against arbitrary power, has been violent∣ly thrown down in America, and the inestimable right of trial by jury taken away, in cases that touch both life and property—It was ordained,
<PB N="159" REF="019364_0157_0FAB4A13AB1C7020"/>
that whenever offences should be committed in the colonies against particular acts imposing va∣rious duties and restrictions upon trade, the pro∣secutor might bring his action for the penalties in the Courts of Admiralty; by which means the subject lost the advantage of being tried by an honest uninfluenced jury of the vicinage, and was subjected to the sad necessity of being judged by a single man, a creature of the Crown, and accor∣ding to the course of a law, which exempts the prosecutor from the trouble of proving his ac∣cusation, and obliges the defendant either to e∣vince his innocence or to suffer. To give this new Judicatory the greater importance, and as, if with design to protect false accusors, it is fur∣ther provided, that the Judge's certificate of their having been probable causes of seizure and pro∣secution, shall protect the prosecutor from acti∣ons at common law, for recovery of damages.</P>
<P>By the course of our law, offences committed in such of the British dominions in which courts are established and justice duly and regularly ad∣ministered, shall be there tried by jury of the vi∣cinage. There the offenders and the witnesses are known, and the degree of credibility to be given to their testimony, can be ascertained.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let justice and humanity cease to be the boast of your nation! Consult your history, examine your records of former transactions; nay, turn to the annals of the many arbitrary states and kingdoms that sorround you, and shew us a single instance of men being condemned to suffer for imputed crimes unheard, unquestioned, and
<PB N="160" REF="019364_0158_0FAB4A157502D4D0"/>
without even the specious formality of trial; and that too by laws made expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly for the pur∣pose, and which had no existence at the time of the fact committed. If it is difficult to recon∣cile these proceedings to the genius and temper of your laws and constitution, the task will become more arduous when we call upon our ministerial enemies to justify, not only condemning men untried and by hearsay, but involving the innocent in one common punish∣ment with the guilty, and for an act of thirty or forty, to bring poverty, distress and calamity on thirty thousand souls, and those not your enemies, but your friends, brethren and fellow-subjects.</P>
<P N="7">7. It would be some consolation to us, if the catalogue of American oppressions ended here. It gives us pain to be reduced to the necessity of reminding you, that under the confidence repos∣ed in the faith of government, pledged in a roy∣al charter from a British Sovereign, the fore∣fathers of the present inhabitants of Massachu∣setts-Bay, left their former habitations, and esta∣blished that great, flourishing, and loyal colo∣ny. Without incurring or being charged with a forfeiture of their rights, without being heard, without being tried, without law, and without justice, by an act of Parliament, their charter is destroyed, their liberties violated, their constitu∣tion and form of government changed: And all this upon no better pretence, than because in one of their towns a trespass was committed on some merchandize, said to belong to one of the
<PB N="161" REF="019364_0159_0FAB4A195F004B68"/>
companies, and because the ministry were of opinion, that such high political regulations were necessary to compel due subordination and obedience to their mandates.</P>
<P>Nor are these the only capital grievances un∣der which we labour. We might tell of disso∣lute, weak, and wicked Governors having been fet over us: of legislatures being suspended for asserting the rights of British subjects—of needy and ignorant dependants on great men, advanced to the seats of justice, and to other places of trust and importance; of hard restric∣tions on commerce, and a great variety of less evils, the recollection of which is almost lost under the weight and pressure of greater and more poignant calamities.</P>
<P N="8">8. Now mark the progression of the ministe∣rial plan for enslaving us.</P>
<P>Well aware that such hardy attempts to take our property from us; to deprive us of that va∣luable right of trial by jury; to seize our persons, and carry us for trial to Great Britain; to block∣ade our ports; to destroy our charters, and change our forms of government; would oc∣casion, and had already occasioned, great discon∣tents in all the colonies, which might produce opposition to these measures: An act was passed to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tect, indemnify and screen from punishment such as might be guilty even of murder, in en∣deavouring to carry their oppressive acts into execution: And by another act, the dominion of Canada is to be extended, modelled, and govern∣ed, as that by being disunited from us, detached
<PB N="162" REF="019364_0160_0FAB4A19A3548288"/>
from our interests, by civil as well as religious prejudices, that by their numbers daily swelling with catholic emigrants from Europe, and by their devotion to administration, so friendly to their religion, they might become formidable to us, and on occasion be fit instruments in the hands of power, to reduce the ancient free Pro∣testant colonies to the same state of slavery with themselves.</P>
<P>This was evidently the object of the act:—And in this view, being extremely dangerous to our liberty and quiet, we cannot forbear com∣plaining of it, as hostile to British America—Super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded to these considerations, we cannot help deploring the unhappy condition to which it has reduced the many English set∣tlers, who, encouraged by the royal proclamation, promising the enjoyment of all their rights, have purchased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tates in that country.—They are now the subjects of an arbitrary government, de∣prived of trial by jury, and when imprisoned cannot claim the benefit of the habeas corpus act, that great bulwark and palladium of Eng∣lish liberty:—Nor can we suppress our astonish∣ment, that a British parliament should ever con∣sent to establish, in that country, a religion that has deluged your island in blood, and dispersed impiety, bigotry, persecution, murder and rebel∣lion through every part of the world.</P>
<P N="9">9. This being a true state of facts, let us beseech you to consider to what end they lead.</P>
<P>Admit that the ministry, by the powers of Britain, and the aid of our Roman Catholic
<PB N="163" REF="019364_0161_0FAB4A1B3B0A8468"/>
neighbours should be able to carry the point of taxation, and reduce us to a state of humiliation and slavery:—Such an enterprize would doubt∣less make some addition to your national debt, which already presses down your liberties, and fills you with pensioners and placemen.—We presume also, that your commerce will some∣what be diminished. However, suppose you should prove victorious—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n what condition will you then be? What advantages or what laurels will you reap from such a conquest?</P>
<P>May not a ministry with the same armies in∣slave you?—It may be said you will cease to pay them;—but remember the taxes from A∣merica, the wealth, and we may add, the men, and particularly the Roman Catholics of this vast continent will then be in the power of your enemies—nor will you have any reason to expect, that after making slaves of us, many a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ongst us shall refuse to assist in reducing you to the same abject state.</P>
<P>Do not treat this as chimerical—Know that in less than half a century, the quit-rents reserv∣ed to the crown, from the numberless grants of this vast continent, will pour large streams of wealth into the royal coffers, and if to this be added the power of taxing America at pleasure, the crown will be rendered independent on you for supplies, and will possess more treasure than may be necessary to purchase the <HI>remains</HI> of liber∣ty in your island—In a word, take care you do not fall into the pit that is preparing for us.</P>
<P N="10">10. We believe there is yet much virtue, much
<PB N="164" REF="019364_0162_0FAB4A1BDE673BD0"/>
justice, and much public spirit in the English nation—To that justice we now appeal. You have been told that we are seditious, impatient of government and desirous of independency. Be assured that these are not facts but calumnies.—Permit us to be free as yourselves, and we shall ever esteem an union with you to be our great∣est glory and our greatest happiness; we ever shall be ready to contribute all in our power to the wealsare of the empire—we shall consider your enemies as our enemies, and your interest as our own.</P>
<P>But if you are determined that your ministers shall wantonly sport with the rights of mankind,—If neither the constitution, or the suggestions of humanity can restrain your hands from shed∣ding human blood in such an impious cause, we must then tell you, that we never will submit to be hewers of wood and drawers of water for any ministry or nation in the world.</P>
<P>Place us in the same situation that we were at the close of the last war, and our former harmo∣ny will be restored.</P>
<P>But least the same supineness and the same in∣attention to our common interest, which you have for several years shewn, should continue, we think it prudent to anticipate the consequen∣ces.</P>
<P>By the destruction of the trade of Boston, the ministry have endeavoured to induce submission to their measures. The like fate may befal us all, we will endeavour therefore to live without trade, and recur for subsistance to the sertility
<PB N="165" REF="019364_0163_0FAB4A1D4D9347E0"/>
and bounty of our native soil, which will afford us all the necessaries and some of the convenien∣ces of life.—We have suspended our importati∣on from Great-Britain and Ireland; and in less than a year's time, unless our grievances should be redressed, shall discontinue our ex∣ports to those kingdoms and the West-Indies.</P>
<P>It is with the utmost regret however, that we find ourselves compelled by the over-ruling principles of self preservation, to adopt measures detrimental in their consequences to numbers of our fellow subjects of Great-Britain and Ireland. But we hope, that the magnanimity and justice of the British nation will furnish a Parliament of such wisdom, independence and public spirit, as may save the violated rights of the whole empire from the devices of wicked ministers and evil counsellors, whether in or out of office, and there∣by restore that harmony, friendship and paternal affection between all the inhabitants of his Ma∣jesty's kingdoms and territories, so ardently wished for by every honest and true Ameri∣can.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS OF CONGRESS To the INHABITANTS OF THE FROVINCE OF QUEBEC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-SUBJECTS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the Delegates of the Colonies of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut,
<PB N="166" REF="019364_0164_0FAB4A1D5A7EF198"/>
New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, the counties of Newcastle, Kent and Sussex on De∣laware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and South-Carolina, deputed by the inhabitants of the said colonies, to represent them in a Gene∣ral Congress at Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylvania, to consult together on the best methods to obtain redress of our afflicting griev∣ances, having accordingly assembled and taken into our most serious consideration the state of public affairs on this continent, have thought proper to address your province, as a member therein deeply interested.</P>
<P>When the fortune of war, after a gallant and glorious resistance, had incorporated you with the body of English subjects, we rejoiced in the tru∣ly valuable addition, both on our own and your account; expecting, as courage and generosity are naturally united, our brave enemies would become our hearty friends, and that the Divine Being would bless to you the dispensations of his over-ruling providence, by securing to you and your latest posterity the inestimable advantages of a free English constitution of government, which it is the privilege of all English subjects to enjoy.</P>
<P>These hopes were confirmed by the King's proclamation issued in the year 1763, plighting the public faith for your full enjoyment of those advantages.</P>
<P>Little did we imagine that any succeeding Ministers would so audaciously and cruelly abuse the royal authority, as to withold from you the fruition of the irrevocable rights to which you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thus justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="019364_0165_0FAB4A1F933C1280"/>
But since we have lived to see the unexpected time, when ministers of this flagitious temper have dared to violate the most sacred compacts and obligations, and as you were educated under another form of government, have artfully been kept from discovering the unspeakable worth of that form you are now undoubtedly entitl∣ed to, we esteem it our duty, for the weighty rea∣sons herein after mentioned, to explain to you some of its most important branches.</P>
<P N="2">2. "In every human society," says the celebrat∣ed Marquis Beccaria, "there is an effort conti∣nually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery. The in∣tent of good laws is to oppose this effort, and to diffuse their influence universally and equally."</P>
<P>Rulers, stimulated by this pernicious "effort," and subjects, animated by the just "intent of opposing good laws against it," have occasioned that vast variety of events, that fill the histories of so many nations. All these histories demon∣strate the truth of this simple position, that to live by the will of one man, or set or men, is the production of misery to all men.</P>
<P>On the solid foundation of this principle, Eng∣lishmen reared up the fabric of their constitution with such a strength, as for ages to defy time, tyranny, treachery, internal and foreign wars: and, as an illustrious author<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esquieu.</HI></NOTE> of your nation, hereafter mentioned, observes, "They gave the
<PB N="168" REF="019364_0166_0FAB4A1F9FEE4548"/>
people of their colonies the form of their own government, and this government carrying pros∣perity along with it, they have grown great nations in the forests they were sent to inhabit."</P>
<P>In this form the first grand right is, that of the people having a share in their own govern∣ment, by their representatives, chosen by them∣selves, and in consequence of being ruled by laws which they themselves approve, not by edicts of men over whom they have no controul This is a bulwark surrounding and defending their property, which by their honest cares and la∣bours they have acquired, so that no portion of it can be legally taken from them, but with their own full and free consent, when they in their judgement deem it just and necessary to give them for public services, and precisely direct the easiest, cheapest, and most equal methods in which they shall be collected.</P>
<P>The influence of this right extends still farther. If money is wanted by rulers, who have in any manner oppressed the people, they may retain it, until their grievances are redressed; and thus peaceably procure relief, without trusting to des∣pised petitions, or disturbing the public tran∣quility.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next great right is that of trial by jury. This provides, that neither life, liberty nor pro∣perty can be taken from the possessor, until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage, who from that neigbour∣hood may reasonably be supposed to be acquaint∣ed with his character, and the character of the
<PB N="169" REF="019364_0167_0FAB4A205B15C6E0"/>
witnesses, upon a fair trial, and full enquiry face to face in open court, before us many people as choose to attend, shall pass their sentence upon oath against him; an oath that cannot injure him, without injuring their own reputati∣on, and probably their interest also; as the question may turn on points that, in some degree, concern the general welfare; and if it does not, their verdict may form a prece∣dent, that on a similar trial of their own, may militate against them.</P>
<P>Another right relates merely to the liberty of the person. If a subject is seized and imprisoned, though by order of Go∣vernment, he may, by virtue of this right, immediately obtain a writ, termed a Habeas Corpus, from a Judge, whose sworn duty is to grant it, and thereupon to procure any illegal restraint to be quickly enquired into and redressed.</P>
<P>A fourth right is, that by holding lands by the tenure of easy rents, and not by rigorous and oppressive services, fre∣quently forcing the possessors from their families and their business, to perform what ought to be done, in all well regulat∣ed states, by men hired for the purpose.</P>
<P>The last right we shall mention regards the freedom of the press. The importance of this consists, besides the ad∣vancement of truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion, of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts between subjects, and its consequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppressive officers are shamed or intimidated into more honourable and just modes of conducting affairs.</P>
<P>These are the invaluable rights, that form a considerable part of our mild system of government; that, sending its e∣quitable energy through all ranks and classes of men, defends the poor from the rich, the weak from the powerful, the in∣dustrious from the rapacious, the peaceable from the violent, the tenants from the lords, and all from their superiors.</P>
<P N="4">4. These are the rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and under the protecting and encouraging in∣fluence of which, these Colonies have hitherto so amazingly flourished and increased. These are the rights a profligate Ministry are now striving, by force of arms, to ravish from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and which we are, with one mind, resolved never to resign but with our lives.</P>
<P>These are the rights <HI>you</HI> are entitled to, and ought at this
<PB N="170" REF="019364_0168_0FAB4A21C42A92F8"/>
moment in perfection to exercise. And what is offered to you by the late act of Parliament in their place? Liberty of conscience in your religion? No. God gave it to you; and the temporal powers with which you have been and are connected, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stipulated for your enjoyment of it. If laws, divine and human, could secure it against the despotic caprices of wicked men, it was secured before. Are the French laws in <HI>civil</HI> cases restored? <HI>It seems so.</HI> But observe the cautious kindness of the Ministers, who pretend to be your benefac∣tors. The words of the statute are—that those "laws shall be the rule, until they shall be <HI>varied</HI> or <HI>altered</HI> by any ordinan∣ces of the Governor and Council." Is the "certainty and le∣nity of the <HI>criminal</HI> law of England, and its benefits and ad∣vantages," commended in the said statute, and said to "have been sensibly felt by you," secured to you and your descen∣dants! No. They too are subjected to arbitrary <HI>"alterations"</HI> by the Governor and Council; and a power is expresly re∣served of appointing "such Courts of <HI>criminal, civil</HI> and <HI>ec∣clesiastical</HI> jurisdiction, as shall be thought proper."</P>
<P>Such is the precarious tenure of mere <HI>will,</HI> by which you hold your lives and religion. The crown and its Ministers are impowered, as far as they could be by Parliament, to es∣tablish even the <HI>Inquisition</HI> itself among you. Have you an Assembly composed of worthy men, elected by yourselves, and in whom you can conside, to make laws for you, to watch over your welfare, and to direct in what quantity, and in what manner, your money shall be taken from you? No. The power of making laws for you is lodged in the Governor and Council, all of them dependant upon, and removeable at the <HI>pleasure</HI> of a minister. Besides, another late statute, made without your consent, has subjected you to the impositions of <HI>Excise,</HI> the horror of all free states; they wrest your pro∣perty from you by the most odious taxes, and lay open to in∣solent tax-gatherers, houses the scenes of domestic peace and comfort, and called the castles of English subjects, in the books of their laws. And in every act for altering your govern∣ment and intended to flatter you, you are not authorised to "assess, levy or apply any <HI>rates</HI> and <HI>taxes,</HI> but for the inferior purposes of <HI>making roads,</HI> and erecting and repairing <HI>public buildings,</HI> or for other <HI>local</HI> conveniences, within your respective towns and districts." Why this degrading distinction? Ought not the property, honestly acquired by <HI>Canadians</HI> to be held
<PB N="171" REF="019364_0169_0FAB4A2327AD5940"/>
as facred as that of <HI>Englishmen?</HI> Have not Canadians sense enough to attend to any other public affairs, than gathering stones from one place and piling them up in another? Un∣happy people! who are not only injured, but insulted. Nay more!—With such a superlative contempt of your understand∣ing and spirit has an insolent Ministry presumed to think of you, our respectable fellow subjects, according to the informa∣tion we have received, as firmly to persu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> themselves that your gratitude, for the injuries and insults they have recently offered to you, will engage you to take up arms, and render yourselves the ridicule and detestation of the world, by becom∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ools, in their hands, to assist them in taking that free∣dom from <HI>us,</HI> which they have treacherously denied to <HI>you;</HI> the unavoidable consequence of which attempt, if successful, would be the extinction of all hopes of you or your posterity being ever restored to freedom: For idiotcy itself cannot be∣lieve, that, when their drudgery is performed, they will treat you with less cruelty than they have us, who are of the same blood with themselves.</P>
<P N="5">5. What would your countryman, the immortal <HI>Montesquieu,</HI> have said to such a plan of domination, as has been framed for you? Hear his words, with an intenseness of thought suit∣ed to the importance of the subject.—"In a free state, every man, who is suppoted a free agent, <HI>ought to be concerned in his own government:</HI> Therefore the <HI>legislative</HI> should reside in the whole body of the <HI>people,</HI> or their <HI>representatives.</HI>—The political liberty of the subjects is <HI>a tranquility of mind,</HI> aris∣ing from the opinion each person has of his <HI>safety.</HI> In order to have this liberty, it is requisite the government be so con∣stituted, as that one man need not be <HI>afraid</HI> of another. When the power of <HI>making</HI> laws, and the power of <HI>executing</HI> them, are <HI>united</HI> in the same person, or in the same body of Magis∣trates, <HI>there can be no liberty;</HI> because apprehensions may arise, least the same <HI>Monarch</HI> or <HI>Senate</HI> should <HI>enact</HI> tyrannical laws, to <HI>execute</HI> them in a tyrannical manner."</P>
<P>"The power of <HI>judging</HI> should be exercised by persons taken from the <HI>body of the people,</HI> at certain times of the year, and pursuant to a form and manner prescribed by law. <HI>There is no liberty,</HI> if the power of <HI>judging</HI> be not <HI>separated</HI> from the <HI>legislative</HI> and <HI>executive</HI> powers."</P>
<P>"Military men belong to a profession, which <HI>may be</HI> use∣ful, but <HI>is often</HI> dangerous.—The enjoyment of liberty

and even its support and preservation, consists in every man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> being allowed to speak his thoughts, and lay open his sen∣timents.</P>
<P>Apply these decisive maxims, sanctified by the authority of a name which all Europe reveres, to your own state. You have a Governor, it may be urged, vested with the <HI>executive</HI> powers of <HI>administration.</HI> In him, and in your council, is lodged the power of <HI>making laws.</HI> You have <HI>Judges,</HI> who are to <HI>decide</HI> every cause affecting your lives, liberty or pro∣perty. Here is, indeed, an appearance of the several powers being <HI>separated</HI> and <HI>distributed</HI> into <HI>different</HI> hands, for checks upon one another; the only effectual mode ever invented by the wit of men, to promote their freedom and prosperity. But scorning to be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luded by a tinsel'd outside, and exerting the natural sagacity of Frenchmen, <HI>examine</HI> the specious device, and you will find it, to use an expression of holy writ, "a painted sepulchre," for burying your lives, liberty and pro∣perty.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Judges,</HI> and your <HI>Legislative Council,</HI> as it is called, are <HI>dependant</HI> on your <HI>Governor,</HI> and <HI>he</HI> is <HI>dependant</HI> on the servant of the Crown in Great Britain. The <HI>legislative, exe∣cutive</HI> and <HI>judging</HI> powers are <HI>all</HI> moved by the nods of a Minister. Privileges and immunities last no longer than his smiles. When he frowns, their feeble forms dissolve. Such a treacherous ingenuity has been exerted in drawing up the code lately offered you, that every sentence, beginning with a be∣nevolent pretension, concludes with a dectructive power; and the substance of the whole, divested of its smooth words, is—that the crown and its Minister shall be as absolute through∣out your extended province, as the despots of Asia or Africa. What can protect your property from taxing edicts, and the rapacity of necessitous and cruel masters? your persons from Lettres de Cachet, goals, dungeons, and oppressive services? your li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and general liberty from arbitrary and unfeeling rulers? We defy you to cast your view upon every side, to discern a single circumstance, promising from any quarter the faintest hope of liberty to you or posterity, but from an entire adoption into the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of these Colonies.</P>
<P N="6">6. What advice would the truly great man before mention∣ed that advocate of freedom and humanity, give you, were he now living, and knew that we, your numerous and powerful neighbours, animated by a just love of our in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed rights,

and united by the indissoluble bands of affecti∣on and interest, called upon you, by every obli∣gation of regard for your selves and your children, as we now do, to join us in our righteous contest, to make common cause with us therein, and take a noble chance of emerging from a humiliating subjection under governors, intendants, and mi∣litary tyrants, into the firm rank and condition of English freemen, whose custom it is, derived from their ancestors, to make those tremble, who dare to think of making them miserable?"</P>
<P>Would not this be the purport of his address? "Seize the opportunity presented to you by pro∣vidence itself. You have been conquered into liberty, if you act as you ought. This work is not of man. You are a small people, compared with those who with open arms invite you into fellowship. A moment's reflection should con∣vince you which will be most for your interest and happiness, to have all the rest of North-Ame∣rica your unalterable friends, or your inveterate enemies. The injuries of Boston have roused and anociated every colony from Nova-Scotia to Georgia. Your province is the only link want∣ing to compleat the bridge and strong chain of union. Nature has joined your country to theirs. Do you join your political interests. For their own sakes they never will desert you. Be assur∣ed that the happiness of a people inevitably de∣pends on their liberty, and their spirit to assert it. The value and extent of the advantages ten∣dered to you are immense. Heaven grant you may not discover them to be blessings after they have bid you an eternal adieu."</P>

7 We are too well acquainted with the liberty of sentiment, distinguishing your nation, to imagine that difference of religion will prejudice you a∣gainst a hearty amity with us. You know that the transcendant nature of freedom elevates those who unite in her cause, above all such low minded infirmities. The Swiss Cantons furnish a me∣morable proof of this truth. Their union is com∣posed of Roman Catholic and Protestant States, living in the utmost concord and peace with one another, and thereby enabled, ever since they bravely vindicated their freedom, to defy and defeat every tyrant that has invaded them.</P>
<P>Should there be any among you, as there ge∣nerally are in all societies, who prefer the favours of ministers, and their own private interests to the welfare of their country, the temper of such selfish persons will render them incredibly active in op∣posing all public-spirited measures, from an expec∣tation of being well rewarded for their industry, by their superiors; but we doubt not you will be upon your guard against such men, and not sa∣crifice the liberty and happiness of the whole Ca∣nadian people and their posterity, to gratify the avarice and ambition of individuals.</P>
<P>We do not ask you, by this address, to com∣mence acts of hostility against the government of our common Sovereign.

<HEAD>EXTRACT from the AMERICAN CRISIS No. V. Addressed to Sir WILLIAM HOWE, by THOMAS PAYNE, <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a survey of mankind, we can∣not help cursing the wretch, who, to the un∣avoidable misfortunes of nature shall wilfully add the calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world without studying to encrease them, and that life is sufficiently short without shaking the sand that measures it. The histories of Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the histories of human devils; a good man cannot think of their actions without abhorrence nor of their deaths without rejoicing. To see the bounties of heaven destroyed, the beautiful face of nature laid wasts, and the choicest works of creation and art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curse from the soul of piety itself. But in this country the aggravation is lengthened by a new combination of affecting circumstances. Ame∣rica was young, and compared with other coun∣tries
<PB N="176" REF="019364_0174_0FAB4A2729035420"/>
was virtuous. None but a Herod of un∣common malice would have made war upon in∣fancy and innocence; and none but a people of the most finished fortitude dared, under those circumstances, have resisted the tyranny. The natives, or their ancestors, had fled from the for∣mer oppressions of England and with the industry of bees had changed a wilderness into a habita∣ble world. To Britain they were indebted for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven, and God alone is their Lord and Sovereign.</P>
<P>The time, Sir, will come when you, in a me∣lancholy hour, shall reckon up your miseries by your murders in America. Life, with you, be∣gins to wear a clouded aspect. The vision of pleasurable delusion is wearing away, and chang∣ing to the barren wild of age and sorrow. The poor reflection of having served your king will yield you no consolation in your parting mo∣ments. He will crumble to the same undistin∣guished ashes with yourself, and have sins enough of his own to answer for. It is not the farcical benedictions of a Bishop, nor the cringing hy∣pocrisy of a court of chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change guilt in∣to innocence, or make the punishment <HI>one</HI> pang the less. You may, perhaps be unwilling to be serious, but this destruction of the goods of Pro∣vidence, this havoc of the human race, and this sowing the world with mischief, must be accoun∣ted for to him who made and governs it. To us they are only present sufferings but to him they are deep rebellions.</P>

<HEAD>FRAGMENT of an original Letter on the slavery of the Negroes; written in the year 1776, by THOMAS DAY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> (Lately published in London.)</HEAD>
<P>I am extremely fearful of expressing myself ob∣scurely upon so abstract a subject, and must therefore, though with the hazard of prolixity, attempt to place it in a different light.—If you ima∣gine any number of the human species assembled in some particular part of the globe, without any form of government established among them, it is evident, that these individuals may either live together in such a manner as to produce mu∣tual comfort and assistance, or may be the cause of continual misery to each other. No pro∣position in the mathematics can be investigated with more precision than the methods of conduct which have these contrary tendencies. Every dis∣position which inclines one man to assist another, or to avoid giving him offence, or doing him an injury, must necessarily contribute to the com∣mon welfare; which would be perfect, were these dispositions cultivated in the greatest possible degree. On the contrary, every disposition which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the personal security of indivi∣duals
<PB N="178" REF="019364_0176_0FAB4A28CCBBDB70"/>
or deprive them of those things which they have acquired by their industry, is detrimental to the sum of happiness, and would, if carried to the greatest possible degree, entirely destroy that part of the species.—In this view of things, morality arises from necessity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with particular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly observed, produce happiness to society; but when violated or neglected, as necessarily occasion misery, as fire or pointed substances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</P>
<P>I hardly think that the greatest skeptic will deny these distinctions, founded upon facts as certain as the impression of any material substance upon our senses. If we now proceed a little farther, we shall find that the dispositions, which produce these different kinds of conduct, are, by the moralists, ex∣pressed by different names, and enforced by differ∣ent motives, according to their several systems; while natural religion adds its sanctions, and in∣clines us to believe that the Deity himself, who has displayed so great an attention to the happi∣ness and preservation of his creatures here, may extend his benevolence to another stage of existence and compensate the evil sometimes unmeritedly suffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the scheme of human things is perfect as it is august; the clouds which oversha∣dowed our horizon are dissipated, and the gradual progress of triumphant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happiness, is displayed and ascertained.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="179" REF="019364_0177_0FAB4A2958912B58"/>
2. Having laid down these principles, it is easy to apply them to the particular case in question. Slave∣ry is the absolute dependance of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as inconsistent with all ideas of justice as despotism is with the rights of nature. It is a crime so monstrous against the hu∣man species, that all those that practise it deserve to be extirpated from the earth. It is no little, indirect attack upon the safety and happiness of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly strikes at the foundation of all humanity and justice. Rob∣bers invade the property, and murderers, the life of human beings; but he that holds another man in bondage, subjects the whole sum of his exist∣ence to oppression, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more detestable than a robber and assassin combined. But if no one who has com∣mon feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common sense will attempt to justify it by ar∣gument; since it would involve him in the grossest and most inextricable contradictions. He must al∣low that every man has, by nature, a right to live, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to subsis∣tance, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every individual is justified by nature and the Deity, in pursuing his own happiness by all innocent methods, every o∣ther individual is equally justified in making him miserable. In short, it is reducing every thing to the state before described, from which right and justice are equally excluded.</P>
<P>Of you, sir, who say you have several slaves, I beg leave to ask what are the rights you claim
<PB N="180" REF="019364_0178_0FAB4A2A164216F0"/>
over them? Is your power circumscribed by no bounds, and are there particular beings who bring into the world all the rights which you yourself can pretend to, but have so entirely lost them by being transported into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and nature's God?</P>
<P>Surely, sir, unless I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honour and humanity. You start at the idea of wanton and unprovoked barbarity. You would not murder a slave to shew your dex∣terity, nor maim him to prove your strength; you would not dash an insant upon the ground to seed your dogs, even tho' he were black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while she was suck∣ling him, to improve your skill in anatomy. You neither would, nor <HI>dare</HI> you commit actions like these; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and superior right to destroy you like a beast of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your answer: You will feed and clothe your Ne∣groes, you will treat them with humanity and ten∣derness, and then you have a right to a moderate advantage from their labours. All this, sir, is well; and could I conceive you had ever acted in another manner, I should never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your negroes choose to stay with you upon these terms, this is a fair and equitable compact. But what if they should choose to leave you, will you let them go? if you do, you are a man of honor, sense, and hu∣manity; but I fear no West-Indian.</P>
<P>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no punish∣ments more dreadful than death itself for contuma∣cious
<PB N="181" REF="019364_0179_0FAB4A2ADBD23140"/>
slaves? And what is this but claiming the detestable power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings miserable, for your interest or amusement? Who, Sir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loathsome drudgery? and if you have no right to this, what are the punishments you pretend to inflict, but so many additional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life because you withhold your pro∣perty; or a ravisher to a woman's blood, because she defends her chastity! Either then prove your right to their labours, or acknowledge that the pun∣ishments inslicted upon fugitive slaves are a flagiti∣ous insult upon justice, humanity &amp; common sense.</P>
<P N="3">3. Permit me, here, to examine for a moment the nature of the title by which you claim an irre∣deemable property in the labours of your fellow creatures.—A wretch, devoid of compassion and understanding, who calls himself a king of some part of Africa, which suffers the calamity of be∣ing frequented by the Europeans, seizes his in∣nocent subjects or engages in an unnecessary war to furnish himself with prisoners; these are load∣ed with chains, torn from all their comforts and connections, and driven (like beasts to the slaughter house) down to the sea shore, where the mild subjects of a Christian government and a religious king are waiting to agree for the purchase, and to transport them to America. They are then thrust by hundreds into an infectious hold of a ship, in which the greatest part frequently perish by disease, while the rest are reserved to experience the candour and humanity of American patriots—If you have never yet considered it, pause here for
<PB N="182" REF="019364_0180_0FAB4A2B94139278"/>
a moment, and endeavour to impress upon your minds the feelings of a being full as sensible, and perhaps more innocent than you or I, which is thus torn in an instant from every thing that makes life agreeable; from country, friends and parents; from the intercourse of mutual affection with mistress, lover or child; which, possest of feelings more exquisite than European hearts can conceive, is separated forever from all it loves; that reduced to a depth of misery, which even in the midst of freedom and affluence, would be sufficient to overwhelm the most hardened disposition, instead of friends and comforters, and obsequions attendants, fees itself surrounded with unrelenting persecutors and unpitying ene∣mies; wretches who by long intercourse with misery, are grown callous to its agonies; who answer tears with taunts, and complaints with torture! I shudder at the horrors which describe, and blush to be a human creature! Yet these are not the colours of discription, but a recital of facts less strong than the reality. Can any man reflect upon these things, without unutterable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emorse? Can he know that, perhaps, while he is wallowing in luxury and sensuality, there are beings whose existence he has imbittered, mothers shrieking for their children, and children perishing for want of their mothers; wretches who are frantic with rage shame and desperation, or pitting in all the agonies of slow and painful death, who might have been at peace if he had never existed? Can any man know this and hope for mercy, either from his fellow creatures or his God? After the arrival of the surviving wretches
<PB N="183" REF="019364_0181_0FAB4A2CA75D5CB0"/>
in America, you well know in what manner they are transferred to their conscientious master,—how they are brought to the market <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weep∣ing and in chains—how one man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his fellow creatures as he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o beasts, and bargain for their persons—how all the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> duties, affections, and feelings of the human heart, are violated and insulted; and thus you dare to call yourselves the masters of wretches whom you have acquired by fraud, and retain by violence! While I am tracing this practice, which you and every man who has been in the islands or the southern colonies of America, know to be true, my asto∣nishment exceeds even my horror, to find it pos∣sible that any one man should seriously doubt whether an equitable title to hold human beings in bondage can be thus acquired.</P>
<P>With what face, Sir, can he who has never re∣spected the rights of nature in another, pretend to claim them in his own favour? How dare the in∣habitants of the southern colonies speak of privi∣leges and justice? Is money of so much more im∣portance than life? Or have the Americans shared the dispensing power of St. Peter's successors, to excuse their own observance of those rules which they impose upon others? If there is an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American pa∣triot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other, brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.</P>
<P N="4">4. If men would be consistent, they must admit all the consequences of their own principles; and you and your countrymen are reduced to the di∣lemma of either acknowledging the rights of you
<PB N="184" REF="019364_0182_0FAB4A2E8AEC6AD0"/>
Negroes, or of surrendering your own.—If there be certain natural and universal rights, as the de∣clarations of your Congress so repeatedly affirm, I wonder how the unfortunate Africans have in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rred their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>feiture.—Is it the antiquity, or the virtues, or the great qualities of the English Ame∣ricans, which constitutes the difference, and en∣titles them to rights from which they totally ex∣clude more than a fourth part of the species?—Or do you choose to make use of that argument, which the great Montesquieu has thrown out as the severest ridicule, that they are black and you white; that you have lank, long hair, while theirs is short and woolly?</P>
<P>The more attentively you consider this subject, the more clearly you will perceive, that every plea, which can be advanced upon it, is the plea of interest and tyranny combating humanity and truth. You cannot hide from your self, that every title you can alledge must be a title founded upon fraud or violence, and supported by open and a∣vowed injustice, that a man who is born free can never forfeit his inheritance by suffering op∣pression; and that it is a contradiction to urge a purchase of what no one has a right to sell? Nor does it make any difference whether the unfortu∣nate victims pass from one to another, or from one to a thousand masters, any more than whether a nation be enslaved by a first, or by hundredth ty∣rant. There can be no prescription against truth and justice; and the continuance of the evil is so far from justifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime. What would you say to a man in private life, who should pretend to be no thief, because he
<PB N="185" REF="019364_0183_0FAB4A2E97D3CEC8"/>
only bought stolen goods; or that he was no vil∣lain, because he did not forge a deed himself, but only paid another to do it, and enjoyed the estate by that honourable security? Yet this is literally the title which the Americans plead to the unfortunate inhabitants of Africa. You do not go to Africa to buy or steal your Negroes; perhaps, because you are too lazy and luxurious: but you encou∣rage an infamous pitiless, race of men to do it for you, and conscientiously receive the fruits of their crimes. You do not, merciful men, reduce your fellow creatures to servitude! No, men of your independent spirits, that have taken up arms a∣gainst the government that had protected and esta∣blished them, rather than pay a tax of three-pence; that have laid the axe to the root of all human au∣thority, and instead of drinking the bitter waters of civil abuses and prescriptive obedience, have ascended to the living fountains of truth, justice and nature, would never make flagitious attempts upon the liberties and happiness of their brethren! Yes, gentlemen, men of liberal minds like yours, acknowledge all mankind to be their equals.—Leave hereditary tyrants and their flatterers to make distinctions unknown to nature, and to de∣grade one part of the species to brutes, while they equal the other with gods!—You know that this is the greatest of all corruptions, and as such you detest it.—What! are not all men naturally equal? And are not all civil distinctions, when legitimate, the permission of the people, and consequently subordinate to their power and controul? Did you not carry the rights of men into the uncultivated desert and the howling wilderness? Not of
<PB N="186" REF="019364_0184_0FAB4A2F789ABCE8"/>
Frenchmen, nor of Germans, nor of English∣men, but of men;—men, the first and supreme distinction, who, created for freedom and happi∣ness, transport to every soil the inherent preroga∣tives of their nature.</P>
<P>Yes, gentlemen, as you are no longer English∣men, I hope you will please to be men; and, as such, admit the whole human species to a participa∣tion of your unalienable rights. You will not, therefore, drag a trembling wretch from his cot∣age and his family; you will not tear the child from the arms of his frantic mother, that they may drag on a loathsome existence in misery and chains; you will not make depredations upon your un∣offending neighbours, and after having spread de∣solation over a fertile country, reduce the innocent inhabitants to servitude. To do this, you must be monsters, worse, I fear, than a majority of the House of Commons and the English Ministry.—But you are men tremblingly alive to all the rights and feelings of the kind, and I believe some of you at lest are Christians. Your worst actions therefore, the greatest crimes which even your e∣nemies can object, are only that you are the voluntary causes of those mischiefs?—You en∣courage the English pirate to violate the laws of faith and hospitality, and stimulate him to new excesses by purchasing the fruits of his rapine—Your avarice is the torch of treachery and civil war, which desolates the shores of Africa and shakes destruction on half the majestic species of man.</P>
