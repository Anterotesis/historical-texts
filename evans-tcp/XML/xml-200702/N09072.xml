<P>THE extraordinary conduct of the Commissioners of the Customs since the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> and their perseverance in it, make it necessary to bestow a few observations upon it; and upon divers matters, with which it seems to be connected <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Copies of this Narrative, sent to <HI>England</HI> and other Parts, conclude with the foregoing page. Since they were sent, it has ap∣peared necessary to add a few pages to the remaining Copies: to do which an opportunity has been given by the restraint laid on the publishing of the said Narrative here. The reason of that re∣straint will appear by the following Vote of the Town, passed at the Town-Meeting held the 26th of <HI>March,</HI> namely,

<P>The Com∣mittee appointed to prepare a true State of Facts, relating to the execrable Massacre perpetrated on the Evening of the 5th Instant, in order that the same be transmitted to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> having accordingly reported, and the Report being accepted by the Town and ordered to be printed: And whereas the publishing of the said Narrative with the Depositions accompanying it, in this County, may be supposed by the unhappy Persons, now in Custody for Trial, as tending to give an undue Bias to the minds of the Jury, who are to try the same.

<P>The said Commissioners (excepting Mr <HI>Temple</HI>) have all retired from the town: and we find, on particular enquiry, they have not held a meeting of their board since the 9th of <HI>March.</HI> How they have disposed of themselves since that time we shall here relate.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Robinson</HI> is gone to <HI>England:</HI> He sailed the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> and went not only without the leave but, as it is said, contrary to the minds of his superiors, signified to him from home. None but the few, intrusted with the secret, knew any thing of his going till after the departure of the vessel in which he went.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Paxton</HI> retired to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> four Miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> and for the most part has continued there. He has divers times however visited the town since that retiring.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="011583_0004_0F88E1F274002240"/>Mr <HI>Hulton</HI> sometime ago purchased a place at <HI>Brooklyn,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> and has ever since resided there.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Burch,</HI> with his wife, has retired to Mr <HI>Hulton</HI>'s who, together with Mr <HI>Burch</HI> (leaving their wives behind them) are now on a tour to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in the province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> where the last Account from thence left them. It is now above six weeks since a board of Commissioners was held: and it is utterly uncertain when there will be another.</P>
<P>From their first establishment here, to the 11th of <HI>June,</HI> 1768, they held their boards regularly four days every week. They then retired on board the <HI>Romney</HI> man of war, and from thence to the castle: for what purpose, their letters and memorials lately published have sufficiently informed the world. From their re-establishment in <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>No∣vember</HI> 1763, to the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> 1770, they held their boards in the same regular manner. Since that time there have been but two board meetings, the last of which was on the 9th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Now what do all these manoeuvres since the 5th of <HI>March</HI> indicate? Is it possible to suppose they indicate any thing less than a design to take occasion from the outrages and murders committed on the evening of that day by the sol∣diers (assisted perhaps from the custom-house) to represent the town in a disadvantageous light? And does not their former conduct render this highly probable? — Besides, it is a fact, that depositions have been taken in a secret man∣ner, relative to that unhappy affair, to the prejudice of the town; and it is no way improbable that Mr <HI>Robinson</HI> is gone home with memorials and letters from the Commissioners and others, accompanying such depositions.</P>
<P>By some escapes, as well as by what the circumstances above mentioned make probable, a pretty good judgment may be formed of the substance of those Memorials, Letters, and Depositions, namely, that the Custom-house was at∣tacked —the revenue chest in danger, but saved by the fir∣ing upon the <HI>mob</HI>—The King's troops compelled to leave the town—the commissioners thence obliged for their safety to quit it also—the consequent impossibility of their holding boards—the detriment thence arising to the revenue and his Majesty's service—all government at an end, and the Province in a state of rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011583_0005_0F88E1F4ACF896A8"/>If these be, either in whole or in part, the subjects of the dispatches sent home, it is very proper a few observations should be made upon them.</P>
<P>The Custom-house attacked—a falshood. The people drawn into <HI>Kingstreet,</HI> were drawn thither by the cry of fire, and the outrages of the Soldiers, which occasioned it. From the first appearance of the people in <HI>Kingstreet,</HI> to the time of the firing upon them, there had not passed fifteen mi∣nutes. It might with as much truth be affirmed, that they made an attack upon the Custom-house in <HI>London,</HI> as upon the Custom-house in <HI>Boston:</HI> of which latter there was not even a pane of glass broken.</P>
<P>The Revenue Chest in danger—a falshood. It is not pro∣bable the chest is kept at the Custom-house: but if it be, there was, and is, at least as much danger of it from some of the out-door people employed under the Commissioners, as from any body else. It is certain that some of them are of an infamous character.</P>
<P>The troops compelled to quit the town—a falshood. They quitted the town by the orders of their Commanding Officer, in consequence of a <HI>request</HI> from the Lieutenant Governor, who was advised by the council to <HI>pray</HI> the said Officer to remove the troops. This <HI>request</HI> and this <HI>prayer</HI> was ob∣tained by an application from the town to the Lieutenant Governor. Into what times are we fallen, that the govern∣ment of the province is reduced to the humiliating condition of making <HI>such a prayer!</HI></P>
<P>But supposing the troops had been compelled <HI>vi &amp; armis</HI> to quit the town. It would have been a measure justifiable in the sight of GOD and man. When the Soldiers▪ sent hither for the declared purpose of assisting the Civil Magistrate to keep the peace, were themselves in a remarkable manner the breakers of the peace—When, instead of assisting, they insulted him; and rescued offenders of their own corps from justice—when they frequently abused the inhabitants in the night—when they had entered into a combination to com∣mit some extraordinary acts of violence upon the town; and in consequence of it, on the evening of the Massacre, attack∣ed the inhabitants wherever they met them; afterwards firing upon, and killing and wounding a number of them. When all this had been done, and more threatened, it was high time they should be removed from the town. If there
<PB N="6" REF="011583_0006_0F88E1F642CE1BF0"/>
had been no other means of getting rid of them, the inha∣bitants would have had a right by that law of nature, which superceeds all other laws, when they come in competition with it—the law of self-preservation—to have compelled them to quit the town. This law is radical in our nature, indelible from it, and uniformly operating, where it can operate, to the removal or destruction of every thing incom∣patible with it; and is abrogable by no other lawgiver than GOD himself, the great author of it. Therefore, although the resisting the King's troops in any thing they have a right by law to do, may be adjudged treason, yet when they act contrary to law, especially in so outrageous a manner as in the present case, and retain a disposition to repeat it, whereby the lives of the King's subjects are in danger, they then cease to be the King's troops▪ that is, they are not the King's troops for any such purpose, but so far become trai∣tors; and on the failure of other means of riddance from them, which the time and circumstances may make eligible and are lawful, they may (by the principles of all law, as well as by the great law above-mentioned, into which those principles are resolvable) be resisted and expelled: and not to do it, where it can be done, is a species of treason against the constitution, and consequently treason in an equal de∣gree against the King, and all his subjects.</P>
<P>The Commissioners obliged for their safety to quit the town—If one falshood can be more so than another, this is the greatest yet mentioned, and is as ridiculous as it is false. Their conduct and such a declaration by no means agree. Would they in that case occasionally visit the town? Would they trust themselves in the environs of it? Could they think themselves safe at <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Brooklyn?</HI> Could they think themselves safe any where in the province, or indeed in <HI>America?</HI> Must they not know, if any evil were really intended them, it might easily overtake them any where, and every where on this side of the <HI>Atlantic?</HI> Some other reason than their safety must therefore be looked for to ac∣count for their retiring, and discontinuing their boards. A similar proceeding of theirs in <HI>June,</HI> 1768, and their Letters and Memorials, lately published, give occasion at least to conjecture what that reason may be. Is it not pro∣bable it was to corroborate the said depositions, and thence induce administration to think it necessary, not only that
<PB N="7" REF="011583_0007_0F88E1F6F7E91858"/>
troops already here should be continued, but that a further number should be sent to strengthen and support them? If this measure cannot be effected, and should the Commis∣sioners be so unfortunate as to remain here unattacked in the absence of the troops, it might naturally be thought they could have remained here without them in 1768; and therefore that they had put the nation to a very great ex∣pence, for no other purpose than further to alienate the affections of the <HI>Americans,</HI> and to give them an additional reason to wish themselves independent of it: And hence the Commissioners might have cause to expect a national resentment against them.—However injurious to us the effects of such policy may be, we cannot but applaud it (on the principles of the <HI>Machiavilian</HI> system) as it stands related to themselves. If they thought their own existence in danger, considered as Commissioners, how natural was it to use the means to support it? And what fault could be found with the means, if those principles justified them? Why need they trouble their heads about consequences that would not affect themselves? or, if they would, and such existence appeared precarious without those means, was it not necessary they should be used, and the consequences disregarded?—If the means be successful to the end for which they seem designed, it requires no prophetic spirit to foretel that the consequences may be—bad enough. Whether the present Commissioners, or any Board of Commissioners at all (whose appointments are fully equal to any benefit the Nation or Colonies are likely to reap from them, and whose usefulness hitherto may be valued by some of the negative quantities in algebra) are <HI>things</HI> of importance enough to hazard those consequences, or any ill consequence at all, is humbly submitted to the wisdom of administration to determine.</P>
<P>The consequent impossibility of their holding boards— This impossibility was of their own creating. If they had continued in town (from whence they had not the least rea∣son to depart, unless to answer purposes they would choose to conceal) they might have held their boards as usual.</P>
<P>The detriment thence arising to the Revenue, and his Majesty's service—If any such detriment has arisen, the fault is their own. <HI>His Majesty's service</HI> is a cant term in the mouths of understrappers in office. Many of them ei∣ther
<PB N="8" REF="011583_0008_0F88E1F7B9E8A560"/>
do not know the meaning of it, or abuse it to answer their own corrupt purposes. It is used to express something distinct from the service of the people. The King and Peo∣ple are placed by it in opposite interests. Whereas, by the happy constitution we are under, the interest of the King is the interest of the people, and his service is their service: both are one, and constitutionally inseparable. They who attempt to separate them attempt to destroy the constitu∣tion. Upon every such parricide may the vengeance both of King and People descend.</P>
<P>Government at an end—This has been the cry ever since the stamp-act existed. If the people saw they were going to be enslaved; if they saw Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> (from whom they had a right to expect that he would do nothing to pro∣mote it) was zealous and active to rivet the chains; and that <HI>his</HI> government, in its principles and conduct, tended to the establishment of a tyranny over them, was it unnatural for them in such a case to reluct? was it unreasonable to re∣fuse an acquiescence in such measures? Did an opposition to them indicate a disregard to government? If government, in the true idea of it, has for its object the good of the governed, <HI>such</HI> an administration could not be called govern∣ment: and an opposition to it by no means included an oppo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> to government. From such an opposition has arisen <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>ry, that government is at an end. The sooner <HI>such</HI> government is at an end the better.</P>
<P>When a people have lost all confidence in government, it is vain to expect a cordial obedience to it. Hence irre∣gularities may arise, and have arisen. But they will cease, when the true ends of government are steadily pursued. Then, and not till then, may it be expected, that men of weight and influence will exert themselves to make go∣vernment respected. Nay, such exertions will then be needless, for mankind cannot help respecting what is in itself respectable, especially when it is at the same time so promotive of their own good as good government is.</P>
<P>The province in a state of rebellion—Into this state its enemies, on both sides of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> have been endeavour∣ing to bring it. When they could not make it subservient to their interest and views; and when their measures had raised a spirit of opposition to them, that opposition was made the lucky occasion to represent the province in a state
<PB N="9" REF="011583_0009_0F88E1F8B7545268"/>
of rebellion, or verging towards it. To justify such a re∣presentation the more fully, they endeavoured to drive it into that state: whereby in the end they might hope to gra∣tify both their malice and avarice: their malice, by injuring it most essentially; and their avarice, by the subjection of it to their tyranny and pillage. But nothing can be more false than such a representation: nothing more foreign from this people than a disposition to rebellion. The principles of loyalty were planted in our breasts too deep to be eradi∣cated by <HI>their</HI> efforts, or any efforts whatever: and our in∣terest co-operated with those principles.</P>
<P>It is humbly hoped his Majesty will not be influenced, by <HI>such</HI> representations, to think unfavorably of <HI>his faithful subjects of this province:</HI> and <HI>that</HI> hope is grounded upon their innocence: of which they have the highest evidence in their own consciousness; and of which they have given their adversaries no other cause to doubt, than what arises from an opposition to <HI>their</HI> measures. Measures, not only ruinous to the province, but hurtful to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and destructive of the union, and commercial intercourse, which ought always to subsist between her and her Colonies.</P>
<P>The foregoing Observations appeared necessary to vindicate the Town and Province from the aspersions so unjustly cast upon them. The few that follow refer to the present and future state of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Colonies.</P>
<P>HOW happy is <HI>Britain</HI> with regard to situation, and and many internal circumstances; and in her connec∣tion with her Colonies!</P>
<P>Separated from the rest of the world, and possessed of so large a naval force, she is secure from foreign invasions: her government (well administred) is the best existing; her manufactures are extensive, and her commerce in propor∣tion. To the two latter the Colonies have in a considerable degree contributed. By these means she has risen to her present opulence and greatness, which so much distinguish her among the powers of <HI>Europe.</HI> But however great and opulent she may be, she is capable of being still more so; and so much so, that she may be deemed at present in a state of minority, compared with what she will one day
<PB N="10" REF="011583_0010_0F88E1FA5FC1F970"/>
probably be, if her own conduct does not prevent it. The means of this greatness are held out to her by the Colonies; and it is in her power, by a kind and just treatment of them, to avail herself of those means.</P>
<P>The Colonists are husbandmen, and till lately have ma∣nufactured but a small part of their clothing, and the other articles with which they had been usually supplied from <HI>Great Britain.</HI> But they have been taught by experience they can supply themselves; and <HI>that</HI> experience (which has been forced upon them) has demonstrated most clearly, that they have within themselves the means of living con∣veniently, if not with elegance, even if their communica∣tion with the rest of mankind were wholly cut off. This, however, could not be an eligible state: but no one in∣titled to and deserving the liberties of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> can hesitate a moment to say, that it would be preferable to slavery; to which the Colonists have apprehended them∣selves doomed, by the measures that have been pursued by Administration.</P>
<P>If the Colonists might be permitted to follow their in∣clinations, with which at the same time their interest coin∣cides, they would be husbandmen still, and be supplied as usual from <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The yearly amount of those supplies (as appears by the exports from <HI>Britain</HI>) is very considerable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The value of the exports from <HI>Britain</HI> to the Colonies in 1766, which was less than in 1765, stood thus:

<P>This is taken from <HI>The Present State of the Nation:</HI> in which there is an account of the said exports for the years 1765 and 1766 only.</P>
<P>Now, supposing the observation just, that the Colonists (whose number by the said Pamphlet is estimated two millions) double every twenty years, and the exports from <HI>Great Britain</HI> to the Co∣lonies should increase in that proportion, the value of the said exports and the number of the Colonists, at the end of five such periods after 1766, will stand thus:
<LIST>

<LABEL>1866</LABEL>
<ITEM>55,586,080 for sixty-four millions of Colonists.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The last mentioned numbers are so large, that it is likely the principles on which they are formed may be called into question. Let us therefore take only one quarter part of those numbers; and then the value of exports from <HI>Britain</HI> to the Colonies, in 1866, will be more than thirteen millions sterling for sixteen mil∣lions of Colonists. It is highly probable, by <HI>that</HI> time there will be at least that number of Colonists in the <HI>British</HI> Colonies on this continent. Now, in case there be no interruption of the union and harmony that ought to subsist between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Co∣lonies, and which it is their mutual interest should subsist and be maintained, what good reason can be given why such exports should not bear as great a proportion to the number of the Colonists as they do at this time? If they should, the value of such exports (which will be continually increasing) will be at least thirteen millions <HI>per annum.</HI> A sum far surpassing the value of all the ex∣ports from <HI>Great Britain</HI> at this day.</P>
<P>In what proportion so vast a trade with the Colonies would en∣large the other branches of her trade; how much it would increase the number of her people, the rents and value of her lands, her wealth of every species, her internal strength, her naval power, and particularly her revenue (to enhance which in a trifling degree has occasioned the present uneasiness between her and the Colonies) are matters left to the calculation and decision of the political arithmeticians of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P></NOTE>, and might be in future in proportion to the
<PB N="11" REF="011583_0011_0F88E1FAC4F48E00"/>
increase of the Colonists. Their increase is rapid: they are daily emigrating from the old towns, and forming new ones; and if they double their numbers every twenty years, as it is said they will continue to do, so long as they can form into families by procuring the means of subsistence at an easy rate, which probably will be the case, till <HI>America</HI> shall be well peopled, there will be in a short time a prodigious addition to his Majesty's subjects; who, if not compelled to manufacture for themselves, will occasion a proportion∣able demand for the manufactures of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> If it be
<PB N="12" REF="011583_0012_0F874B58B7D86AD0"/>
considered too, that <HI>America,</HI> from its different soils and climates, can raise perhaps all the productions of other countries in the same latitudes: which being remitted in exchange would most of them be rough materials for <HI>Britain</HI> to manufacture; what a fund of wealth and power will <HI>America</HI> be to her! Her inhabitants, of every denomination, by finding employment, and the consequent means of sub∣sistence, will greatly encrease; and her trade and naviga∣tion be in proportion. She might then view with indiffe∣rence the interdiction of her trade with other parts of the world; though she would always have it in her power, from the superiority of her naval force, which such a trade and navigation would enable her to support, to do herself justice, and command universal respect.</P>
<P>Connected with her Colonies, she would then be a mighty empire: the greatest, consisting of people of one language, that ever existed.</P>
<P>If these observations be not wholly visionary, and a mere reverie, they possibly may not be unworthy the consideration of Parliament: whose wisdom will determine, whether any revenue whatever, even the greatest that <HI>America</HI> could pos∣sibly produce, either without or with her good will, would compensate the loss of such wealth and power; or justify measures that had the least tendency to bring them into ha∣zard: or whether for such a revenue it would be worth while to hazard even the present advantages, resulting to <HI>Great Britain</HI> from an union and harmony with her Colonies.</P>
