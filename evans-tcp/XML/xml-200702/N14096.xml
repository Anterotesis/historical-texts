<HEAD>A SERIOUS ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Sound mind in a sound body, is said to be a state of the highest human happiness indi∣vidually; when these blessings are separate, a sound mind, wise and prudent conduct, tend much to support and preserve an unsound body: On the other hand, where the body is sound, the constitution strong and healthy, if the mind is un∣sound, the governing principle weak and feeble, the body feels the injuries which ensue, the health and constitution often become enfeebled and sickly, and untimely death closes the scene. This reason∣ing holds good politically, being sometimes realized in bodies politick, and perhaps never more so than in the conduct lately exhibited to mankind by Great-Britain. Her constitution was sound, strong and firm, in a degree that drew admiration from the whole world; but, for want of a sound mind, her directing and governing powers being imprudent and unwise, to such a debilitated and sickly state is this fine constitution reduced, that, without a change of regimen, her decease may not be very remote. Ame∣rica
<PB N="4" REF="017839_0003_0FA4BDDAE659B408"/>
is a child of this parent, who long since, with many severe pangs, struggled into birth, and is now arrived to the state of manhood, and thrown off the restraints of an unwise parent, is become master of his own will, and, like a lovely youth, hath stepped upon the stage of action. State physicians pronounce his constitution strong and sound: the eyes of the world are singularly attentive to his conduct, in order to determine with certainty on the soundness of his mind. It is the general Congress, as the head, that must give the colouring, and stamp wisdom or folly on the counsels of America. May they demonstrate to the world, that these blessings, a sound mind in a sound body, are in America politically united!</P>
<P>IT was a claim of freedom unfettered from the arbitrary control of others, so essential to free agents, and equally the gift of our beneficent Creator to all his rational children, which put fleets and armies into motion, covered earth and seas with rapine and carnage, disturbed the repose of Europe, and ex∣hausted the treasure of nations. Now is the time to demonstrate to Europe, to the whole world, that America was in earnest, and meant what she said, when, with peculiar energy, and unanswerable rea∣soning, she plead the cause of human nature, and with undaunted firmness insisted, that <HI>all mankind</HI> came from the hand of their Creator <HI>equally free.</HI> Let not the world have an opportunity to charge her conduct with a contradiction to her solemn and often repeated declarations; or to say that her sons are not real friends to freedom; that they have been actuated in this awful contest by no higher motive than selfishness and interest, like the wicked servant in the gospel, who, after his Lord had forgiven his
<PB N="5" REF="017839_0004_0F4ABDDB984E7150"/>
debt which he was utterly unable to pay, shewed the most cruel severity to a fellow servant for a tri∣fling demand, and thereby brought on himself a punishment which his conduct justly merited. Ye rulers of America beware: Let it appear to future ages, from the records of this day, that you not only professed to be advocates for freedom, but really were inspired by the love of mankind, and wished to secure the invaluable blessing to all; that, as you disdained to submit to the unlimited control of others, you equally abhorred the crying crime of holding your fellow men, as much entitled to freedom as yourselves, the subjects of your undis∣puted will and pleasure.</P>
<P>HOWEVER habit and custom may have render∣ed familiar the degrading and ignominious distincti∣ons, which are made between people with a black skin and ourselves, I am not ashamed to declare myself an advocate for the rights of that highly injured and abused people; and were I master of all the resistless persuasion of Tully and Demosthenes, could not employ it better, than in vindicating their rights as men, and forcing a blush on every Ameri∣can slave-holder, who has complained of the treat∣ment we have received from Britain, which is no more to be equalled, with ours to negroes, than a barley corn is to the globe we inhabit. Must not every generous foreigner feel a secret indignation rise in his breast when he hears the language of Americans upon any of their own rights as freemen, being in the least infringed, and reflects that these very people are holding thousands and tens of thousands of their innocent fellow men in the most debasing and abject slavery, deprived of every right of freemen, except light and air? How similar to
<PB N="6" REF="017839_0005_0FA4BDDC5B66F038"/>
an atrocious pirate, setting in all the solemn pomp of a judge, passing sentence of death on a petty thief. Let us try the likeness by the standard of facts.</P>
<P>THE first settlers of
these colonies emigrated
from England, under the
sanction of royal char∣ters,
held all their lands
under the crown, and
were protected and de∣fended
by the parent
state, who claimed and
exercised a control over
their internal police, and
at length attempted to
levy taxes upon them,
and, by statute, declared
the colonies to be under
their jurisdiction, and
that they had, and ought
to have, a right to make
laws to bind them in all
cases whatsoever.</P>
<P REND="small">AFRICA lies many
thousand miles distant,
its inhabitants as inde∣pendent
of us, as we are
of them; we sail there,
and foment wars among
them in order that we
may purchase the priso∣ners,
and encourage the
stealing one another to
sell them to us; we bring
them to America, and
consider them and their
posterity forever, our
slaves, subject to our ar∣bitrary
will and pleasure;
and if they imitate our
example, and offer by
force to assert their native
freedom, they are con∣demned
as traitors, and
a hasty gibbet strikes ter∣ror
on their survivors,
and rivets their chains
more secure.</P>
<P>THE American Con∣gress
in their declaration,
July 1775, say,</P>
<P>"IF it were <HI>possible</HI>
for men who exercise
their reason to believe
that the divine Author of
<PB N="7" REF="017839_0006_0FA4BDDD21712070"/>
our existence intended
a <HI>part</HI> of the human race
to hold an absolute pro∣perty
in, and an un∣bounded
power over
others, marked out by
infinite goodness and
wisdom, as the objects
of a legal domination
never rightly resistible,
however severe and op∣pressive;
the inhabitants
of these colonies might
at least require from the
parliament of Great-Bri∣tain
some evidence, that
this <HI>dreadful authority</HI>
over them has been grant∣ed
to that body. But a
<HI>reverence</HI> for our <HI>great
Creator, principles of hu∣manity,</HI>
and the dictates
of <HI>common sense,</HI> must
convince all those who
reflect upon the subject,
that government was in∣stituted
to promote the
welfare of mankind, and
ought to be administered
for the attainment of that
end."</P>
<P REND="small"><PB N="6" REF="017839_0005_0FA4BDDC5B66F038"/>
DOES not this forcible
reasoning apply equally
to Africans? Have we a
better right to enslave
them and their posterity,
than Great-Britain had
to demand Three-pence
<PB N="7" REF="017839_0006_0FA4BDDD21712070"/>
per pound for an article
of luxury we could do
very well without? And
Oh! America, will not
a <HI>reverence</HI> for our <HI>great
Creator, principles</HI> of <HI>hu∣manity,</HI>
nor the <HI>dictates</HI>
of <HI>common sense,</HI> awaken
thee to <HI>reflect,</HI> how far
thy government falls
short of impartially <HI>pro∣moting</HI>
the <HI>welfare</HI> of
<HI>mankind,</HI> when its laws
suffer, yea justify men
in murdering, torturing
and abusing their fellow
men, in a manner shock∣ing
to humanity?</P>
<P>AGAIN they say,—
"By this persidy (Howe's
conduct in Boston) <HI>wives</HI>
are <HI>separated</HI> from their
<PB N="8" REF="017839_0007_0FA4BDDE6F68D740"/>

<P REND="small"><PB N="7" REF="017839_0006_0FA4BDDD21712070"/>
HOW abundantly more
aggravated is our con∣duct
in these respects to
Africans, in bringing
<PB N="8" REF="017839_0007_0FA4BDDE6F68D740"/>
them from their own coun∣try,
and separating by sale
these near connections,
never more to see each
other, or afford the least
<HI>comfort</HI> or tender endear∣ment
of social life. But
they are black, and ought
to obey; we are white,
and ought to rule.—Can
a better reason be given
for the distinction, that
Howe's conduct is <HI>perfi∣dy,</HI>
and ours innocent
and blameless, and justi∣fied
by our <HI>laws?</HI></P>
<P>"WE most solemnly
before GOD and the
world declare, that ex∣erting
the utmost energy
of those powers which
our beneficent Creator
hath graciously bestowed
upon us, the arms we
have been compelled by
our enemies to assume,
we will in defiance of
every <HI>hazard,</HI> with un∣abated

<HI>slaves.</HI>"</P>
<P REND="small">THOU wicked servant,
out of thine own mouth
shalt thou be judged.—
Is a claim to take thy

thou wilt defy every ha∣zard

<P>"IN our own native
land, in defence of the
freedom that is our birth-right,
and which we
ever enjoyed till the late
violation of it; for the
protection of our pro∣perty
acquired solely by
the honest industry of
our forefathers and our∣selves;
against violence
actually offered, we have
taken up arms."</P>
<P REND="small">THE unenlightened Af∣ricans,
in their own na∣tive

which was their
birthright, until the more
savage christians tran∣sported
them by thou∣sands,
and sold them for
slaves in the wilds of
America, to cultivate it
for their lordly oppres∣sors.</P>
<P>IN a resolve of Con∣gress,
October 1774,
they say,</P>
<P>"THAT the Inhabi∣tants
of the English co∣lonies
in North-America,
by the <HI>immutable laws</HI> of
<HI>nature,</HI> are entitled to
life, liberty and property;
and they have never
<PB N="10" REF="017839_0009_0FA4BDE12A761630"/>
ceded to any sovereign
power whatever a right
to dispose of either with∣out
their consent."</P>
<P REND="small"><PB N="9" REF="017839_0008_0FA4BDDEF87D8C40"/>
WITH equal justice
may negroes say, By the
<HI>immutable laws of nature,</HI>
we are equally entitled
to life, liberty and pro∣perty
with our lordly
masters, and have never
<HI>ceded</HI> to any power what∣ever,
a <HI>right</HI> to deprive

To the people of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>"KNOW then that we
consider ourselves, and
do insist, that we are and
ought to be, as free as
our fellow-subjects in
Britain, and that no
power on earth has a
right to take our pro∣perty
from us without
our consent."</P>
<P REND="small">DOES this reasoning
apply more forcibly in
favour of a white skin
than a black one? Why
ought a negro to be less
free than the subjects of
Britain, or a white face
in America? Have we
not all one father? Hath
not one God created us?
Why do we deal trea∣cherously
every man
against his brother? Mal.

<P>"ARE the proprie∣tors

less lords of their

of yours? <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—Reason
looks with indignation
on such distinctions, and
freemen can never per∣ceive
their propriety;
and yet, however, chi∣merical
and unjust such
discriminations are; the
Parliament assert, that
they have a right to bind
us in all cases without
exception, whether we
consent or not; that

rigor upon others,
who are indeed <HI>pension∣ers</HI>
on their <HI>bounty</HI> for all

THIS was the voice, the language of the supreme council of America, in vindication of their rights as men, against imposition and unjust control:—Yes, it was the voice of all America, through her re∣presentatives in solemn Congress uttered. How clear, full and conclusive! "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." "By the immutable laws of nature <HI>all men</HI> are en∣titled to life and liberty." We need not now turn over the libraries of Europe for authorities to prove that blacks are born equally free with whites; it is de∣clared and recorded as the sense of America: Cease then ye cruel taskmasters, ye petty tyrants, from attempting to vindicate your having the same interest in your fellow men as in your cattle, and let blush∣ing and confusion of face strike every American, who henceforth shall behold advertisements offer∣ing their brethren to sale, on a footing with brute beasts.</P>
<P>BUT what shall I say! Forgive it, Oh Heaven, but give ear, Oh earth! while we are execrating our
<PB N="14" REF="017839_0013_0FA4BDE9A21762F0"/>
parent state with all the bitterness of invective, for attempting to abridge our freedom, and invade our property; we are holding our brethren in the most servile bondage, cast out from the <HI>benefit</HI> of our <HI>laws,</HI> and subjected to the cruel treatment of the most imperious and savage tempers, without <HI>redress,</HI> without advocate or friend.</P>
<P>OUR rulers have appointed days for humiliation, and offering up of prayer to our common Father to deliver us from <HI>our</HI> oppressors, when sighs and groans are piercing his holy ears from oppressions which we commit a thousand fold more grievous: pouring forth blood and treasure year after year in defence of our own <HI>rights;</HI> exerting the most assiduous at∣tention and care to secure them by laws and sancti∣ons, while the poor Africans are continued in chains of slavery as creatures unworthy of notice in these high concerns, and left subject to laws disgraceful to humanity, and opposite to every precept of chri∣stianty. One of these in effect gives Fifteen Pounds for the murder of a slave; that is, after a slave has absconded a certain time, Twenty Pounds is given to any one who shall bring his head, and but Five Pounds if he is brought alive. Another, which empowers certain officers to seize negroes set free, and sell them for the benefit of government: And, even during the present contest, negroes have been seized with the estates of persons who had gone over to the British, and sold by publick auction into <HI>perpetual slavery,</HI> and the proceeds cast into stock for the <HI>defence</HI> of American <HI>liberty.</HI> Of the same complexion is an instance in New-Jersey: A female Quaker, about seven years since, manumitted her ne∣groes; the times having reduced her so as to be unable fully to discharge a debt for which she was
<PB N="15" REF="017839_0014_0FA4BDE9D82C7A00"/>
only surety, the creditor, a great declaimer in be∣half of <HI>American freedom,</HI> although he was offered his principal money, obtains a judgment, levies on these free negroes, who by the assistance of some real friends of freedom, procured a <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> and removed their case before the justices of the supreme court. How many such mock patriots hath this day discovered, whose flinty hearts are as impervious to the tender feelings of humanity and commiseration as the nether millstone; can sport with the rights of men; wallow and riot in the plunder, which their unhallowed hands have squeezed from others! But only touch <HI>their</HI> imma∣culate interests, and what an unceasing outcry in∣vades every ear. A love for my country, a regard for the honour of America, raises an ardent wish, that this picture may never be realized in her rulers.</P>
<P>IT may be objected that there are many difficul∣ties to be guarded against in setting of negroes free, and that. were they all to be freed at once, they would be in a worse condition than at present. I admit that there is some weight in these objections; but are not these difficulties of our own creating? And must the innocent continue to suffer because we have involved ourselves in difficulties? Let us do justice as far as circumstances will admit, give such measure as we ask, if we expect Heaven to favour us with the continuance of our hard earned liberty. The work must be begun, or it can never be completed. "It is begun and many negroes are set free." True, it is begun, but not in a manner likely to produce the desired <HI>end,</HI> the entire <HI>aboliti∣on</HI> of <HI>slavery.</HI> This is the business of the superin∣tending authority, the main spring which gives motion to the whole political machine; which, were
<PB N="16" REF="017839_0015_0FA4BDECD5BA0AD0"/>
they to undertake in good earnest, I have no doubt but we should soon see a period sixed, when our land should no longer be polluted with slave-holders, nor give forth her increase to feed slaves: And in∣deed it hath been a matter of wonder to many, that that body, who have been so much employed in the study and defence of the <HI>rights,</HI> of <HI>humanity,</HI> should suffer so many years to elapse without any effectual movement in this business. Had they, with the declaration of independence, recommended it to the different Legislatures to provide laws, de∣claring, that no person imported into, or born in America after that date, should be held in slavery: it would have been a step correspondent with our own <HI>claims,</HI> and in time, have completed the work, nor can I see any impropriety, but what the nature of the case will justify, to have it still take place.</P>
<P>TO shew the necessity of this matter taking its rise at the head, if any thing effectual is done. I may instance the Quakers. Some among them, it is said, always bore a testimony against slavery from its first introduction, and the uneasiness increasing, advices were given forth cautioning their members against being concerned in importing slaves, to use those well whom they were possessed of, school their children, <HI>&amp;c;.</HI> but some of the foremost of that society having experienced the profits of their labour, no effectual stop could be put to the practice, tho' many became uneasy, and set their negroes free, until the difficulties attending the late French and Indian war, brought the rights of men into a more close inspection, when a rule was agreed upon, pro∣hibiting their members from being concerned with importing, buying, or selling of slaves; and some years after a further rule was made, enjoining all
<PB N="17" REF="017839_0016_0FA4BDEF5C8AFDD8"/>
those who held slaves to set them free, otherwise to be separated from religious membership.—The work was then soon accomplished, and they now say there are very few members belonging to the yearly meet∣ing of Philadelphia who hold a slave.</P>
<P>WHEN a grievance is general, it is but trifling to apply partial means; it is like attempting to de∣stroy a great tree by nibbling at its branches. It is only the supreme power which pervades the whole that can take it up by the roots.—The disquisitions and reasonings of the present day on the rights of men, have opened the eyes of multitudes who clear∣ly see, that, in advocating the rights of humanity, their slaves are equally included with themselves, and that the arguments which they advance to con∣vict others, rebounds with redoubled force back on themselves, so that few among us are now hardy enough to justify slavery, and yet will not release their slaves; like hardened sinners, acknowledge their guilt, but discover no inclination to reform. It is true these convictions have occasioned the re∣lease of many slaves, and two or three states to make some feeble efforts looking that way; but I fear, after the sunshine of peace takes place, we have little more to expect, unless the sovereign power is exerted to finish this sin, and put an end to this crying transgression.</P>
<P>LET me now address that august body, who are by their brethren clothed with sovereign power, to fit at the helm, and give a direction to the impor∣tant concerns of the American union. You, gen∣tlemen, have, in behalf of America, <HI>declared</HI> to Europe, to the world, "That all men are born <HI>equal,</HI> and, by the <HI>immutable laws</HI> of <HI>nature,</HI> are <HI>equally</HI> entitled to liberty." We expect, mankind
<PB N="18" REF="017839_0017_0FA4BDF13819A608"/>
expects, you to demonstrate your <HI>faith</HI> by your <HI>works;</HI> the <HI>sincerity</HI> of your <HI>words</HI> by your <HI>actions,</HI> in giving the <HI>power,</HI> with which you are <HI>invested,</HI> its utmost <HI>energy</HI> in promoting <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>impartial</HI> liberty to <HI>all</HI> whose lots are cast within the reach of its influence—then will you be revered as the real friends of mankind, and escape the execrati∣ons which pursue human tyrants, who shew no remorse at sacrificing the ease and happiness of any number of their fellow-men to the increase and ad∣vancement of their own, are wholly regardless of others rights if theirs are but safe and secure. We are encouraged in this expectation by the second article of your nonimportation agreement in be∣half of America, October 1774, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> "That we will neither import nor purchase any slave imported after the first day of December next, after which time we will wholly discontinue the slave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels nor sell our commodities or ma∣nufactures to those who are concerned in it."—And much would it have been for the honour of Ame∣rica, had it been added and confirmed by laws in each state (nor will we suffer such a stigma to re∣main on our land, as that it can produce slaves, therefore no child, born in any of the United States after this date, shall be held in slavery.)—But the children of slaves are private property, and cannot be taken from their masters without a compensati∣on! What! After it hath so often been echoed from America, "All men are born equally free." "No man or body of men can have a legitimate property in, or control over their fellow-men, but by their own consent expressed or implied. Shall we now disown it in order to hold our slaves? Forbid

it all honest men; it is treason against the rights of humanity, against the principles upon which the American revolution stands, and by which the pre∣sent contest can only be justified; to deny it, is to justify Britain in her claims, and declare ourselves rebels. Wherefore our rulers undoubtedly ought to give these principles, these laws which themselves have declared <HI>immutable,</HI> a due force and efficacy. This every wellwisher to their country, either in a religious or political sense have a right to ask and expect. But we have laws that will maintain us in the possession of our slaves: "The fundamental law of nature being the good of mankind, no human sanctions can be good, or valid against it, but are of themselves void, and ought to be resist∣ed," Lock. Therefore none can have just cause of complaint, should so desirable an event take place, as that no person brought into, or born within any of the United States after the declara∣tion of independence, shall be held a slave.</P>
<P>WHEN I read the constitutions of the different stares, they afford a mournful idea of the partiality and selfishness of man; the extraordinary care, and wise precautions they manifest to guard and secure our own rights and privileges, without the least notice of the injured Africans, or gleam of expec∣tation afforded them, of being sharers of the gol∣den fruitage, except in that of the Delaware state, who, to their lasting honour, while they were hedging in their own, provided against the invasi∣on of the rights of others. By the twenty-sixth article of their constitution they resolve, that "No person hereafter imported into this state from Afri∣ca, ought to be held in slavery under any pretence whatever; and no negro, indian or mulatto slave,
<PB N="20" REF="017839_0019_0FA4BDF35F9A7058"/>
ought to be brought into this state for sale from any part of the world." Had they went further and made provision by which slavery must at length have terminated within their jurisdiction, it would have been doing something to the purpose; and, as this is the only constitution in which posterity will see any regard paid to that abused people, I hope the same humane considerations which led them so far, will induce them to take the lead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this was written I had, by information, been led to believe, that the late Pennsylvania slave law was very partial and inadequate, but have since learned, that it is a judicious and well constructed law, which provides for the entire abolition of slave∣ry in that state.</NOTE> in doing their part toward putting an effectual end to this crying evil, which will ever remain a stain to the annals of America.</P>
<P>AND you who in the several states are clothed with legislative authority, and have now an oppor∣tunity of displaying your wisdom and virtue by your laws freed from every foreign control, although this people were below notice, and their rights and interest thought unworthy of a sanction in your con∣stitutions; let me beseech you, if you wish your country to escape the reproach and lasting infamy of denying to others what <HI>she</HI> hath so often, and in the most conclusive language, declared were the rights of <HI>all;</HI> if you wish to retain the name of christians, of friends to human nature, and of look∣ing up acceptably in prayer to the common father of men to deal with you in the same tenderness and mercy as you deal with others; that you would even now regard the rigorous oppressions of his other children, and your brethren, which they suf∣fer under laws which you only can abrogate.

your negro laws calculated not to protect and de∣fend them, but to augment and heighten their calamitous situation! Cast out and rejected by the regulations formed for the defence and security of the rights and privileges, and to guard and improve the morals and virtue of the whites: Left open to the gratification of every passion and criminal commerce with one another, as though they were brutes and not men; fornication, adultery, and all the rights of marriage union among blacks, considered be∣neath the notice of those rules and sanctions formed to humanize and restrain corrupt nature, or the regard of those whose duty it is to enforce them. Yes, blush Americans! Ye have laws, with severe penalties annexed, against these crimes when com∣mitted between whites; but, if committed by blacks, or by white men with black women, with the aggravated circumstances of force and violence, they pass as subjects of mirth, not within the cog∣nizance of law or magistrates inquiry, and lose the very name of crimes. Hence children often become familiar with these scenes of corruption and wickedness, before they are capable of distinguish∣ing between the duties of christianity, and the ap∣petites of unrestrained nature. No marvel then if slave-holders are often scourged by the vices of their own offspring, which their untutored slaves have been a means of inflicting—children who, instead of being educated in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, are too often nurtured in pride, idle∣ness, lewdness, and the indulgence of every natural appetite; that, were there no other inducement, this singly is sufficient to cause every real christian to lift a hand against, and exert their utmost influ∣ence in, bringing this hydra mischief to a period.</P>

but when we consider the accumulated guilt, in other respects, abundantly set forth by other writers on this subject, brought on this land through the introduction of this infernal traffick, at a time when we were denied the privilege of making laws to check the mighty evil; and that near ten years have now elapsed since this restraint hath been removed, and no effectual advance yet made towards loosing the bands of wickedness, and letting the oppressed go free, or even of putting it in a train whereby it may at length come to an end; I say, it is matter of anxious sorrow, and affords a gloomy presage to the true friends of America. Have we reason to expect, or dare we ask of him whose <HI>ways</HI> are all <HI>equal,</HI> the continuance of his blessings to us, whilst our <HI>ways</HI> are so <HI>unequal.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now conclude with the words of Congress to the people of England, a little varied to suit the present subject.</P>
<P>"IF neither the voice of <HI>justice,</HI> the dictates of <HI>humanity,</HI> the <HI>rights</HI> of <HI>human nature,</HI> and establish∣ment of <HI>impartial liberty now in your power,</HI> the good of your <HI>country,</HI> nor the fear of an <HI>avenging God,</HI> can restrain your hands from this <HI>impious prac∣tice</HI> of holding your fellow-men in <HI>slavery;</HI> making traffick of, and advertising in your publick prints for sale as common merchandize, <HI>your brethren</HI> pos∣sessed of immortal souls equal with yourselves; then let <HI>justice, humanity, advocates for liberty,</HI> and the sacred name of <HI>christians,</HI> cease to be the <HI>boast</HI> of <HI>American rulers.</HI>"</P>
