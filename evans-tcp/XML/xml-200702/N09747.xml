<P>THERE are an hundred faults in this Thing, and an hundred things might be said to prove them beauties. But it is needless. A book may be amusing with numerous errors, or it may be very dull without a single absurdity. The hero of this piece unites in himself the three greatest characters upon earth; he is a priest, an husbandman, and the father of a family. He is drawn as ready to teach, and ready to obey, as simple in affluence, and majestic in adversity. In this age of opulence and refinement whom can such a character please? Such as are fond of

high life, will turn with disdain from the simplicity of his country fire side. Such as mistake ribaldry for humour, will find no wit in his harmless conversation; and such as have been taught to deride religion, will laugh at one whose chief stores of com∣fort are drawn from futurity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The description of the family of Wakefield; in which a kindred likeness prevails as well of minds as of per∣sons.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS ever of opinion that the honest man who married and brought up a large family, did more ser∣vice than he who continued single, and only talked of population. From this motive, I had scarce taken or∣ders a year, before I began to think seriously of matri∣mony, chose my wife as she did her wedding gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but such qualities as would wear well. To do her justice, she was a good natured notable woman: and as for breeding, there were few country ladies who at that time could shew more. She could read any English book without much spelling, and for pickling, preserving, and cookery, none could excel her. She prided herself much also upon being an excel∣lent contriver in house-keeping; yet I cou'd never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances.</P>
<P>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondness encreased with age. There was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other. We had an elegant house, situated in a fine country, and a good neighbourhood. The year was spent in moral or rural amusements; in visiting our rich neighbours, or relieving such as were poor. We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to undergo; all our adventures were by the fire-side, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown.</P>
<P>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or stranger come to taste our gooseberry wine, for which we had great reputation; and I profess with the veracity of an historian, that I never knew one of them find fault with it. Our cousins too even to the fortieth remove,
<PB N="6" REF="012405_0005_0F89729BB2DF0A70"/>
all remembred their affinity, without any help from the Herald's office, and came very frequently to see us. Some of them did us no great honour by these claims of kindred; for literally speaking we had the blind, the maimed, and halt amongst the number. However, my wife always insisted that as they were the same <HI>flesh and blood,</HI> with us, they should sit with us at the same table. So that if we had not very rich, we generally had very happy friends about us; for this remark will hold good thro' life, that the poorer the guest, the better pleased he ever is with being treated: and as some men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip, and others are smitten with the wings of a butterfly, so I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces. However, when any one of our relations was found to be a person of very bad character, a troublesome guest, or one we desired to get rid of, upon his leaving my house for the first time, I ever took care to lend him a riding coat, or a pair of boots, or sometimes an horse of small value, and I al∣ways had the satisfaction of finding he never came back to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. By this the house was cleared of such as we did not like; but never was the family of Wake∣field known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors.</P>
<P>Thus we lived several years in a state of much happi∣ness, not but that we sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to enhance the value of its fa∣vours. My orchard was often robbed by school-boys, and my wife's custards plundered by the cats or the chil∣dren. The 'Squire would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic parts of my sermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curtesy. But we soon got over the uneasiness caused by such accidents, and usually in three or four days we began to wonder how they vext us.</P>
<P>My children, the offspring of temperance, as they were educated without softness, so they were at once well formed and healthy; my sons hardy and active, my daughters dutiful and blooming. When I stood in the midst of the little circle which promised to be the sup∣ports of my declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous story of Count Abensberg, who, in Henry
<PB N="7" REF="012405_0006_0F89729C771AA8B0"/>
II's progress through Germany, when other courtiers came with their treasures, brought his thirty two chil∣dren and presented them to his sovereign as the most va∣luable offering he had to bestow. In this manner, though I had but six, I considered them as a very valuable pre∣sent made to my country, and consequently looked upon it as my debtor. Our eldest son was named George, af∣ter his uncle, who left us ten thousand pounds. Our second child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Grissel; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, insisted upon her being called Olivia. In less than another year we had a daughter again, and now I was determined that Grissel should be her name; but a rich relation taking a fancy to stand godmother, the girl was, by her directions, called So∣phia; so that we had two romantic names in the family; but I solemnly protest I had no hand in it. Moses was our next, and after an interval of twelve years, we had two sons more.</P>
<P>It would be fruitless to deny my exultation when I saw my little ones about me; but the vanity and the satisfac∣tion of my wife were even greater than mine. When our visitors would usually say,
<Q>Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primrose, you have the finest children in the whole country.</Q>
—"Ay, neighbour," she would answer,
<Q>they are as heaven made them, handsome enough, if they be good, enough; for handsome is that handsome does.</Q> And then she would bid the girls hold up their heads; who, to conceal nothing, were certainly very handsome. Mere outside is so very trifling a circumstance with me, that I should scarce have re∣membered to mention it, had it not been a general topic of conversation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriancy of beauty with which painters have generally drawn Hebe; open, sprightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not so striking at first; but often did more certain execution; for they were soft, modest, and alluring. The one vanquished by a single blow, the other by efforts successively re∣peated.</P>
<P>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features, at least it was so with my daughters.
<PB N="8" REF="012405_0007_0F89729D32165B70"/>
Olivia wished for many lovers, Sophia to secure one. Olivia was often affected from too great a desire to please. Sophia even represt excellence from her sears to offend. The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay, the other with her sense when I was serious. But these qualities were never carried to excess in either, and I have often seen them exchange characters for a whole day together. A suit of mourning has transform∣ed my coquet into a prude, and a new set of ribbands given her younger sister more than natural vivacity. My eldest son George was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned professions. My second boy Mo∣ses, whom I designed for business, received a sort of miscellaneous education at home. But it would be needless to attempt describing the particular characters of young people that had seen but very little of the world. In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and, properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inof∣fensive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Family misfortunes. The loss of fortune only serves to encrease the pride of the worthy.</HEAD>
<P>THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife's management, as to the spiritual, I took them entirely under my own direction. The profits of my living, which amounted to but thirty- five pounds a year, I gave to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our diocese; for having a sufficient fortune of my own, I was careless of temporalities, and felt a secret pleasure in doing my duty without reward. I also set a resolution of keeping no cura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and of being ac∣quainted with every man in the parish, exhorting the married men to temperance, and the batchelors to ma∣trimony? so that in a few years it was a common saying, that there were three strange wants at Wakefield, a par∣son
<PB N="9" REF="012405_0008_0F89729EB9765B90"/>
wanting pride, young men wanting wives, and ale-houses wanting customers.</P>
<P>Matrimony was always one of my favourite topics, and I wrote several sermons to prove its utility and hap∣piness: but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of supporting; for I maintained with Whiston, that it was unlawful for a priest of the church of England, after the death of his first wife, to take a second, or, to express it in one word, I valued myself upon being a strict monogamist.</P>
<P>I was early initiated into this important dispute, on which so many laborious volumes have been written. I published some tracts upon the subject myself, which, as they never sold, I have the consolation of thinking are read only by the happy <HI>Few.</HI> Some of my friends called this my weak side; but alas! they had not like me made it the subject of long contemplation. The more I reflected upon it, the more important it appeared. I even went a step beyond Whiston in displaying my principles: as he had en∣graven upon his wife's tomb, that she was the <HI>only</HI> wife of William Whiston; so I wrote a similar epitaph for my wife, tho' still living, in which I extolled her prudence, oeconomy and obedience till death; and having got it copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it answered several very useful purposes. It admonished my wife of her duty to me, and my fideli∣ty to her; it inspired her with a passion for fame, and constantly put her in mind of her end.</P>
<P>It was thus, perhaps, from hearing marriage so often recommended, that my eldest son, just upon leaving college, fixed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dignitary in the church, and in circumstances to give her a large fortune: but fortune was her smallest accomplishment. Miss Arabella Wil∣mot was allowed of all, except my two daughters, to be completely pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence, were still heightened by a complexion so transparent, and such an happy sensibility of look, that even age could not gaze with indifference. As Mr. Wilmot knew that I could make a very handsome settlement on my son, he was not averse to the match; so both families lived to∣gether in all that harmony which generally precedes an
<PB N="10" REF="012405_0009_0F89729FC00668A0"/>
expected alliance. Being convinced by experience that the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives, I was willing enough to lengthen the period; and the va∣rious amusements which the young couple every day shared in each other's company, seemed to encrease their passion. We were generally awakened in the morning by music, and on fine days rode a hunting. The hours be∣tween breakfast and dinner, the ladies devoted to dress and study: they usually read a page, and then gazed at themselves in the glass, which even philosophers might own, often presented the page of greatest beauty. At dinner my wife took the lead; for as she always insist∣ed upon carving every thing herself, it being her mother's way, she gave us upon these occasions the history of eve∣ry dish. When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving us, I generally ordered the table to be removed; and sometimes, with the music master's assistance, the girls would give us a very agreeable concert. Walk∣ing out, drinking tea, country dances, and forfeits, shortened the rest of the day, without the assistance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming, except back∣gammon, at which my old friend and I sometimes took a two-penny hit. Nor can I here pass over an ominous circumstance that happened the last time we played toge∣ther. I only wanted to fling a quatre, and yet I threw deuce ace five times running.</P>
<P>Some months were elapsed in this manner, till at last it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple, who seemed earnestly to desire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not de∣scribe the busy importance of my wife, nor the sly looks of my daughters: in fact, my attention was fixed on another object, the completing a tract which I intended shortly to publish in defence of monogamy. As I looked upon this as a master piece both for argument and style, I could not in the pride of my heart avoid shewing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of re∣ceiving his approbation: but too late I discovered that he was most violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good reason; for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife. This, as may be expected, pro∣duced a dispute attended with some acrimony, which
<PB N="11" REF="012405_0010_0F8972A0357739B0"/>
threatened to interrupt our intended alliance: but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to discuss the subject at large.</P>
<P>It was managed with proper spirit on both sides: he asserted that I was heterodox. I retorted the charge: he replied, and I rejoined. In the mean time, while the controversy was hottest, I was called out by one of my relations, who, with a face of concern, advised me to give up the dispute, and allow the old gentlemen to be a husband, if he could, at least till my son's wedding was over. "How," cried I,
<Q>relinquish the cause of truth, and let him be an husband, already driven to the very verge of absurdity. You might as well ad∣vise me to give up my fortune as my argument.</Q> "That fortune," returned my friend,
<Q>I am now sor∣ry to inform you is almost nothing. Your merchant in town, in whose hands your money was lodged, has gone off, to avoid a statute of bankruptcy, and it is thought has not left a shilling in the pound. I was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till after the wedding: but now it may serve to mode∣rate your warmth in the argument; for, I suppose, your own prudence will enforce the necessity of dis∣sembling, at least, till your son has the young lady's fortune secured.</Q>
—"Well," returned I,
<Q>if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a beggar, it shall never make me a rascal, or induce me to disavow my principles. I'll go this moment and inform the company of my circumstances; and as for the argu∣ment, I even here retract my former concessions in the old gentleman's favour, nor will I allow him now to be an husband either de jure, de facto, or in any sense of the expression.</Q></P>
<P>It would be endless to describe the different sensations of both families when I divulged the news of my misfor∣tunes; but what others felt was slight to what the young lovers appeared to endure. Mr. Wilmot, who seemed before sufficiently inclined to break off the match, was by this blow soon determined: one virtue he had in per∣fection, which was prudence, too often the only virtue that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> left us unimpaired at seventy-two.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A migration. The fortunate circumstances of our lives are generally found at last to be of our own pro∣curing.</HEAD>
<P>THE only hope of our family now was, that the report of our misfortunes might be malicious or premature: but a letter from my agent in town soon came with a confirmation of every particular. The loss of fortune to myself alone would have been trifling; the only uneasiness I felt, was for my family, who were to be humble without such an education as could render them callous to contempt.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight passed away before I attempted to restrain their affliction; for premature consolation is but the remembrance of sorrow. During this interval my thoughts were employed on some future means of sup∣porting them; and at last a small Cure of fifteen pounds a year was offered me in a distant neighbourhood, where I could still enjoy my principles without molestation. With this proposal I joyfully closed, having determined to encrease my salary by managing a little farm.</P>
<P>Having taken this resolution, my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune; and all debts col∣lected and paid, out of fourteen thousand pounds we had now but four hundred remaining. My chief attention therefore, was next to bring down the pride of my fami∣ly to their circumstances; for I well knew that aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself.
<Q>You can't be igno∣rant, my children,</Q>
cried I,
<Q>that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune; but prudence may do much in disappointing its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wisdom bids us conform to our humble situation. Let us then, with∣out repining, give up these splendours with which numbers are wretched, and seek in humbler circum∣stances that peace with which all may be happy. The poor live pleasantly without our help, and we are not so imperfectly formed as to be incapable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="13" REF="012405_0012_0F8972A1B3A8A3D0"/>
living without theirs. No, my children, let us from this moment give up all pretensions to gentility; we have still enough left for happiness, if we are wise, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune.</Q></P>
<P>As my eldest son was bred a scholar, I determined to send him to town, where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own. The separation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the most distressful cir∣cumstances attendant on penury. The day soon arrived on which we were to disperse for the first time. My son, after taking leave of his mother and the rest, who ming∣led their tears with their kisses, came to ask a blessing from me. This I gave him from my heart, and which, added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had now to bestow. "You are going, my boy," cried I,
<Q>to London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great ancestor, travelled there before you. Take from me the same horse that was given him by the good bishop Jewel, this staff, and take this book too, it will be your comfort on the way: these two lines in it are worth a million, <HI>I have been young, and now am old; yet never saw I the righteous man forsaken, or his seed beg∣ging their bread.</HI> Let this be your consolation as you travel on. Go, my boy, whatever be thy fortune let me see thee once a year; still keep a good heart, and farewell.</Q>
As he was possest of integrity and honour, I was under no apprehensions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life; for I knew he would act a good part whether he rose or fell.</P>
<P>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days afterwards. The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed so many hours of tranquillity, was not without a tear, which scarce for∣titude itself could suppress. Besides, a journey of seven∣ty miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehension, and the cries of the poor, who followed us for some miles, contributed to encrease it. The first day's journey brought us in safety within thirty miles of our future retreat, and we put up for the night at an obscure inn in a village by the way. When we were shewn a room, I desired the land∣lord,
<PB N="14" REF="012405_0013_0F8972A272F11B70"/>
in my usual way, to let us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would encrease the bill next morning. He knew, however, the whole neighbourhood to which I was removing, particularly 'Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and who lived within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he described, as one who desired to know little more of the world than the pleasures it afforded, being particu∣larly remarkable for his attachment to the fair sex. He observed that no virtue was able to resist his arts and assi∣duity, and that scarce a farmer's daughter within ten miles round, but what had found him successful and faithless. Though this account gave me some pain, it had a very different effect upon my daughters, whose features seemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph, nor was my wife less pleased and confident of their allurements and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the hostess entered the room to inform her husband that the strange gentleman, who had been two days in the house, wanted money, and could not satisfy them for his reckoning.
<Q>Want mo∣ney!</Q>
replied the host,
<Q>that must be impossible; for it was no later than yesterday he paid three gui∣neas to our beadle to spare an old broken soldier that was to be whipped through the town for dog-steal∣ing.</Q> The hostess, however, still persisting in her first assertion, he was preparing to leave the room, swear∣ing that he would be satisfied one way or another, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger of so much charity as he described. With this he com∣plied, shewing in a gentleman who seemed to be about thirty, drest in cloaths that once were laced. His per∣son was well formed, though his face was marked with the lines of thinking. He had something short and dry in his address, and seemed not to understand ceremony, or to despise it. Upon the landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expressing my concern to the stranger, at seeing a gentleman in such circumstances, and offered him my purse to satisfy the present demand.
<Q>I take it with all my heart, Sir,</Q>
replied he,
<Q>and am glad that a late oversight in giving what money I had about me, has shewn me that there is still some benevolence
<PB N="15" REF="012405_0014_0F8972A333F82748"/>
left among us. I must, however, previously entreat being informed of the name and residence of my bene∣factor, in order to remit it as soon as possible.</Q>
In this I satisfied him fully, not only mentioning my name and late misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove. "This" cried he,
<Q>happens still more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the same way myself, having been detained here two days by the floods, which, I hope, by to morrow will be found passable.</Q>
I testified the pleasure I should have in his company, and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty, he was prevailed upon to stay to supper. The stranger's conversation, which was at once pleasing and instructive induced me to wish for a continuance of it; but it was now high time to retire and take refreshment against the fatigues of the following day.</P>
<P>The next morning we all set forward together: my family on horseback, while Mr. Burchel, our new com∣panion, walked along the foot-path by the road-side, observing, with a smile, that as we were ill mounted, he would be too generous to attempt leaving us behind. As the floods were not yet subsided, we were obliged to hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchel and I bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the road with philosophical disputes, which he seemed per∣fectly to understand. But what surprised me most was, that though he was a money borrower, he defended his opinions with as much obstinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then also informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in our view, as we travelled the road. "That," cried he, pointing to a very magnificent house which stood at some distance,
<Q>belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely dependant on the will of his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, a gentle∣man, who content with a little himself, permits his nephew to enjoy the rest, and chiefly resides in town.</Q>
"What!" cried I,
<Q>is my young landlord then the ne∣phew of a man whose virtues, generosity, and singu∣larities are so universally known? I have heard Sir William Thornhill represented as one of the most ge∣nerous, yet whimsical, men in the kingdom; a man
<PB N="16" REF="012405_0015_0F8972A3F2D79830"/>
of consummate benevolence.</Q>
—Something, per∣haps, too much so, replied Mr. Burchel,
<Q>at least he carried benevolence to an excess when young; for his passions were then strong, and as they all were upon the side of virtue, they led it up to a romantic ex∣treme. He early began to aim at the qualifications of the soldier and scholar; was soon distinguished in the army, and had some reputation among men of learn∣ing. Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for such alone receive most pleasure from flattery. He was surrounded with crowds, who shewed him only one side of their character; so that he began to lose a re∣gard for private interest in universal sympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were rascals. Physicians tell us of a disorder in which the whole body is so exquisitely sensible, that the slightest touch gives pain: what some have thus suffered in their persons, this gentleman felt in his mind. The slightest distress, whether real or fictitious, touched him to the quick, and his soul la∣boured under a fickle sensibility of the miseries of o∣thers. Thus disposed to relieve, it will be easily con∣jectured, he found numbers disposed to solicit: his profusions began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature; that, indeed, was seen to encrease as the other seemed to decay; he grew improvident as he grew poor; and though he talked like a man of sense, his actions were those of a fool. Still, how∣ever, being surrounded with importunity, and no longer able to satisfy every request that was made him, instead of <HI>money</HI> he gave <HI>promises.</HI> They were all he had to bestow, and he had not resolution enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this means he drew round him crowds of dependants, whom he was sure to disappoint; yet wished to relieve. These hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt. But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became despicable to himself. His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and that support taken away, he could find no pleasure in the applause of his heart, which he had never learnt to reverence itself. The world now began to wear
<PB N="17" REF="012405_0016_0F8972A4B56B2FA8"/>
a different aspect; the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into simple approbation, that soon took the more friendly form of advice, and advice when re∣jected ever begets reproaches. He now found that such friends as benefits hath gathered round him were by no means the most estimable: it was now found that a man's own heart must be ever given to gain that of another. I now found, that—but I forget what I was going to observe: in short, Sir, he resolved to respect himself, and laid down a plan of restoring his shattered fortune. For this purpose, in his own whimsical manner he travelled through Europe on foot, and before he attained the age of thirty, his circumstances were more affluent than ever. At pre∣sent, therefore, his bounties are more rational and moderate than before; but still he preserves the cha∣racter of an humourist, and finds most pleasure in ec∣centric virtues.</Q></P>
<P>My attention was so much taken up by Mr. Burchel's account, that I scarce looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of my family, when turning. I perceived my youngest daughter in the midst of a rapid stream, thrown from her horse, and strug∣gling with the torrent. She had sunk twice, nor was it in my power to disengage myself in time to bring her relief. My sensations were even too violent to permit my attempting her rescue; she would have certainly perished had not my companion, perceiving her danger, instantly plunged in to her relief, and, with some difficulty, brought her in safety to the opposite shore. By taking the current a little farther up; the rest of the family got safely over; where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to her's. Her gratitude may be more readily imagined than described: she thanked her deli∣verer more with looks than words, and continued to lean upon his arm, as if still willing to receive assistance. My wife also hoped one day to have the pleasure of re∣turning his kindness at her own house. Thus, after we were all refreshed at the next inn, and had dined to∣gether, as he was going to a different part of the coun∣try, he took leave; and we pursued our journey. My wife observing as we went, that she liked Mr. Burchel

extremely, and protesting, that if he had birth and for∣tune to entitle him to match into such a family as our's, she knew no man she would sooner fix upon. I could not but smile to hear her talk in this strain: one almost at the verge of beggary thus to assume language of the most insulting affluence, might excite the ridicule of ill- nature; but I was never much displeased with those in∣nocent delusions that tend to make us more happy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A proof that even the humblest fortune may grant hap∣piness and delight which depend not on circumstance, but constitution.</HEAD>
<P>THE place of our new retreat was in a little neighbourhood, consisting of farmers, who tilled their own grounds, and were equal strangers to opulence and poverty. As they had almost all the conveniences of life within themselves, they seldom visited towns or cities in search of superfluity. Remote from the polite, they still retained a primaeval simplicity of manners, and frugal by long habit, scarce knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought with chearfulness on days of la∣bour; but observed festivals as intervals of idleness and pleasure. They kept up the Christmas carol, sent true love-knots on Valentine morning, eat pancakes on Shrove-tide, shewed their wit on the first of April, and religi∣ously cracked nuts on Allhollow eve. Being apprized of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their minister, drest in their finest cloaths, and preceded by a pipe and tabor: also a feast was provided for our reception, at which we sat chearfully down; and what the conversation wanted in wit, we made up in laugh∣ter.</P>
<P>Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a slo∣ping hill, sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a pratling river before; on one side a meadow, on
<PB N="19" REF="012405_0018_0F8972A6336BBA10"/>
the other a green. My farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having given an hundred pounds for my predecessor's good-will. Nothing could exceed the neatness of my little enclosures: the elms and hedge rows appearing with inexpressible beauty. My house consisted of but one story, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great snugness: the walls on the inside were nicely white-washed, and my daughters un∣dertook to adorn them with pictures of their own design∣ing. Though the same room served us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides, as it was kept with the utmost neatness, the dishes, plates, and coppers, being well scoured, and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves, the eye was agreeably relieved, and did not seem to want rich furniture. There were three other apartments, one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters, within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the rest of my children.</P>
<P>The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulat∣ed in the following manner; by sun-rise we all assembled in our common apartment: the fire being previously kindled by the servant. After we had saluted each other with proper ceremony, for I always thought fit to keep up some mechanical forms of good breeding, without which, freedom ever destroys friendship, we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed, my son and I went to pursue our usual industry, while my wife and daughters employed themselves in providing breakfast, which was always rea∣dy at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner; which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife and daughters, and in philosophical arguments between my son and me.</P>
<P>As we rose with the sun, so we never pursued our la∣bours after it was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family, where smiling looks, a neat hearth, and pleasant fire, were prepared for our reception. Nor were we without other guests: sometimes farmer Flam∣borough, our talkative neighbour, and often the blind piper, would pay us a visit, and taste our gooseberry wine; for the making of which we had lost neither the
<PB N="20" REF="012405_0019_0F8972A81A3E52A0"/>
receipt nor the reputation. These harmless people had several ways of being good company, while one played the pipes, another would sing some soothing ballad, Jonny Armstrong's last good night, or the cruelty of Barbara Allen. The night was concluded in the manner we began the morning, my youngest boys being appoint∣ed to read the lessons of the day, and he that read loud∣est, distinctest, and best, was to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put in the poor's box.</P>
<P>When sunday came it was indeed a day of finery, which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain. How well soever I fancied my lectures against pride had con∣quered the vanity of my daughters: yet I still found them secretly attached to all their former finery: they still loved laces, ribbands, bugles and catgut; my wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy, be∣cause I formerly happened to say it became her.</P>
<P>The first sunday in particular their behaviour served to mortify me: I had desired my girls the preceding night to be drest early the next day; for I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the con∣gregation. They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were to assemble in the morning at breakfast, down came my wife and daughters, drest out in all their former splendour: their hair plaistered up with poma∣tum, their faces patched to taste, their trains bundled up into an heap behind, and rustling at every motion. I could not help smiling at their vanity, particularly that of my wife, from whom I expected more discretion. In this exigence, therefore, my only resource was to order my son, with an important air, to call our coach. The girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more solemnity than before.—
<Q>Surely, my dear, you jest,</Q>
cried my wife,
<Q>we can walk it per∣fectly well: we want no coach to carry us now</Q>
"You mistake, child," returned I,
<Q>we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this trim, the very children in the parish will hoot after us for a shew.</Q>
—Indeed, replied my wife,
<Q>I always imagined that my Charles was fond of seeing his chil∣dren neat and handsome about him.</Q> —
<Q>You may be as neat as you please,</Q>
interrupted I,
<Q>and
<PB N="21" REF="012405_0020_0F8972A873590500"/>
I shall love you the better for it; but all this is not neatness, but frippery. These rufflings, and pink∣ings, and patchings, will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbours. No, my children,</Q>
continued I, more gravely,
<Q>those gowns may be al∣tered into something of a plainer cut; for finery is ve∣ry unbecoming in us, who want the means of de∣cency. I don't know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich, if we consider, upon a moderate calculation, that the nakedness of the indigent world may be cloathed from the trim∣mings of the vain.</Q></P>
<P>This remonstrance had the proper effect: they went with great composure, that very instant, to change their dress; and the next day I had the satisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own request, employed in cut∣ting up their trains into Sunday waistcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones, and what was still more satis∣factory, the gowns seemed improved by being thus cur∣tailed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>A new and great acquaintance introduced.</HI> What we place most hopes upon generally proves most fatal.</HEAD>
<P>AT a small distance from the house my predecessor had made a seat, over-shaded by an hedge of haw∣thorn, and honeysuckle. Here when the weather was fine, and our labour soon finished, we usually all sat to∣gether, to enjoy an extensive landscape in the calm of the evening. Here too we drank tea, which now was be∣come an occasional banquet; and as we had it but sel∣dom, it diffussed a new joy, the preparations for it being made with no small share of bustle and ceremony. On these occasions, our two little ones always read for us, and they were regularly served after we had done. Some∣times,
<PB N="22" REF="012405_0021_0F8972A9349E46A0"/>
to give a variety to our amusements, the girls fung to the guitar; and while they thus formed a little concert, my wife and I would stroll down the sloping field, that was embellished with blue bells and centaury, talk of our children with rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wasted both health and harmony.</P>
<P>In this manner we began to find that every situation in life might bring its own peculiar pleasures: every morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but the even∣ing repaid it with vacant hilarity.</P>
<P>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday, for I kept such as intervals of relaxation from labour, that I had drawn out my family to our usual place of amusement, and our young musicians began their usual concert, as we were thus engaged, we saw a stag bound nimbly by, within about twenty paces of where we were sitting, and by its panting, it seemed prest by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's distress, when we perceived the dogs and horsemen come sweeping along at some distance be∣hind, and making the very path it had taken. I was in∣stantly for returning in with my family, but either cu∣riosity or surprise, or some more hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their seats. The huntsman who rode foremost, past us with great swiftness, followed by four or five persons more, who seemed in equal haste. At last a young gentleman of a more genteel appearance than the rest came forward, and for a while regarding us, instead of pursuing the chace, stopt short, and giving his horse to a servant who attended, approached us with a careless superior air. He semeed to want no introducti∣on, but was going to salute my daughters as one certain of a kind reception; but they had early learnt the lesson of looking presumption out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his name was Thornhill, and that he was owner of the estate that lay for some extent round us. He again, therefore, offered to salute the female part of the family, and such was the power of fortune and fine cloaths, that he found no second repulse. As his address, though confident, was easy, we soon be∣came more familiar; and perceiving musical instruments lying near, he begged to be favoured with a a song. As I
<PB N="23" REF="012405_0022_0F8972A9F4E02200"/>
did not approve of such disproportioned acquaintances, I winked upon my daughters, in order to prevent their compliance; but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother; so that with a chearful air they gave us a favourite song of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill seemed high∣ly delighted with their performance and choice, and then took up the guitar himself. He played but indif∣ferently; however, my eldest daughter repaid his for∣mer applause with interest, and assured him that his tones were louder than even those of her master. At this compliment he bowed, which she returned with a curtesy. He praised her taste, and she commended his understanding: an age could not have made them better acquainted. While the fond mother too, equally hap∣py, insisted upon her landlord's stepping in, and tasting a glass of her gooseberry. The whole family seemed earnest to please him: my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought most modern, while Mo∣ses on the contrary, gave him a question or two from the ancients, for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed at; for he always ascribed to his wit that laugh∣ter which was lavished at his simplicity: my little ones were no less busy, and fondly stuck close to the stranger. All my endeavours could scarce keep their fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his cloaths, and lift∣ing up the flaps of his pocket holes, to see what was there. At the approach of evening he took his leave; but not till he had requested permission to renew his visit, which, as he was our landlord, we most readily agreed to.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the day. She was of opinion that it was a most fortunate hit; for that she had known even stran∣ger things at last brought to bear. She hoped again to see the day in which we might hold up our heads with the best of them; and concluded, she protested she could see no reason why the two Miss Wrinkles should marry great fortunes, and her children get none. As this last argument was directed to me, I protested I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould see no reason for it neither, nor why one got the ten thousand pound prize in the lottery, and another sat down with a blank. "But those," added I,
<Q>who either aim at
<PB N="24" REF="012405_0023_0F8972AAB3F08A10"/>
husbands greater than themselves, or at the ten thou∣sand pound prize, have been fools for their ridiculous claims, whether successful or not.</Q>
<Q>I protest, Charles,</Q>
cried my wife,
<Q>this is the way you always damp my girls and me, when we are in spirits. Tell me Sophy, my dear, what do you think of our new visitor? Don't you think he seemed to be good-na∣tured?</Q>
—"Immensely so, indeed, Mamma," re∣plied she.
<Q>I think he has a great deal to say upon every thing, and is never at a loss; and the more trifling the subject, the more he has to say; and what is more, I protest he is very handsome.</Q>
—"Yes," cried Oliva,
<Q>he is well enough for a man; but, for my part, I don't much like him, he is so extremely impudent and familiar, but on the guitar he is shock∣ing.</Q>
These two last speeches I interpreted by con∣traries. I found by this, that Sophia internally despised, as much as Olivia secretly admired him.—
<Q>What∣ever may be your opinions of him, my children,</Q>
cri∣ed I,
<Q>to confess a truth, he has not prepossest me in his favour. Disproportioned friendships ever termi∣nate in disgust; and I thought notwithstanding all his case that he seemed perfectly sensible of the dis∣tance between us. Let us keep to companions of our own rank. There is no character among men more contemptible than that of a fortune hunter, and I can see no reason why fortune-hunting women should not be contemptible too. Thus, at best, it will be con∣tempt if his views are honourable; but if they are otherwise! I should shudder but to think of that; for though I have no apprehensions from the conduct of my children, I think there are some from his charac∣ter.</Q> —I would have proceeded, but for the in∣terruption of a servant from the 'Squire, who with his compliments, sent us a side of venison and a pro∣mise to dine with us some days after. This well-timed present pleaded more powerfully in his savour, than any thing I had to say could obviate. I therefore continued silent, satisfied with just having pointed out danger, and leaving it to their own discretion to avoid it. That vir∣tue which requires to be ever guarded, is scarce worth the centinel.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The happiness of a country fire-side.</HEAD>
<P>AS we carried on the former dispute with some de∣gree of warmth, in order to accommodate matters it was universally concluded upon, that we should have a part of the venison for supper, and the girls undertook the task with alacrity. "I am sorry," cried I,
<Q>that we have no neighbour or stranger to take a part in this good cheer: feasts of this kind acquire a double relish from hospitality.</Q> —
<Q>Bless me, cried my wife, here comes our good friend Mr. Burchell, that saved our Sophia, and that run you down fairly in the argument.</Q> —"Confute me in argument, child!" cried I.
<Q>You mistake there, my dear. I believe there are but few that can do that: I never dispute your abilities at making a goose-pye, and I beg you'll leave argument to me,</Q> —As I spoke, poor Mr. Bur∣chell entered the house, and was welcomed by the fami∣ly, who shook him heartily by the hand, while little Dick officiously reached him a chair.</P>
<P>I was pleased with the poor man's friendship for two reasons; because I knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to be friendly as far as he was able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the character of the poor Gentleman that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet above thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good sense; but in general he was fondest of the company of children, whom he used to call harmless little men. He was famous, I found, for singing them ballads, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling them stories; and seldom went without something in his pockets for them, a piece of ginger-bread, or a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>penny whistle. He generally came into our neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hood once a year, and lived upon the neighbours hospit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y. He sate down to supper among us, and my wife was not sparing of her gooseberry wine. The tale went round: he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng us old songs, and gave the children the story of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uck
<PB N="26" REF="012405_0025_0F8972AC33DF9E08"/>
of Beverland, with the history of Patient Grissel. The adventures of Catskin next entertained them, and then Fair Rosamond's bower. Our cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repose; but an unforeseen difficulty started about lodging the stranger: all our beds were already taken up, and it was too late to send him to the next ale-house. In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother Moses would let him lie with him; And I, cried Bill,
<Q>will give Mr. Burchell my part, if my sisters will take me to theirs</Q> —"Well done, my good children," cried I,
<Q>hospitality is one of the first christian duties. The beast retires to its shelter, and the bird flies to its nest; but helpless man can only find refuge from his fellow creature. The greatest stranger in this world, was he that came to save it. He never had an house as if willing to see what hospitality was left re∣maining amongst us. Deborah, my dear,</Q> cried I, to my wife,
<Q>give those boys a lump of sugar each, and let Dick's be the largest, because he spoke first.</Q></P>
<P>In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at saving an after-growth of hay, and our guest of∣fering his assistance, he was accepted among the number. Our labours went on lightly, we turned the swath to the wind, I went foremost, and the rest followed in due suc∣cession. I could not avoid, however, observing the as∣siduity of Mr. Burchell, in assisting my daughter Sophia in her part of the task. When he had finished his own, he would join in her's, and enter into a close conversation: but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's understand∣ing▪ and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under any uneasiness from a man of a broken fortune. When we were finished for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before; but he refused, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's to whose child he was carrying a whistle. When gone, our conversation at sup∣per turned upon our late unfortunate guest.
<Q>What a strong instance.</Q> said I,
<Q>is that poor man of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance. He by no means wants sense, which only serves to ag∣gravate his former folly. Poor forlorn creature, where are now the revellers, the flatterers, that he
<PB N="27" REF="012405_0026_0F8972ACF3EA8AE8"/>
could once inspire and command! Gone, perhaps, to attend the bagnio pander, grown rich by his extrava∣gance. They once praised him, and now they applaud the pander: their former raptures at his wit, are now converted into sarcasms at his folly: he is poor, and perhaps deserves poverty; for he has neither the am∣bition to be independent, nor the skill to be useful.</Q>
Prompted, perhaps, by some secret reasons, I delivered this observation with too much acrimony, which my Sophia gently reproved.
<Q>Whatsoever his former con∣duct may be, papa, his circumstances should exempt him from censure now. His present indigence is a sufficient punishment for former folly; and I have heard my papa himself say, that we should never strike our unnecessary blow at a victim over whom providence already holds the scourge of its resent∣ment.</Q> —"You are right, Sophy," cried my son Moses,
<Q>and one of the ancients finely represents so malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a rustic to flay Marsyas, whose skin, the fable tells us, had been wholly stript off by another. Besides, I don't know if this poor man's situation be so bad as my father would represent it. We are not to judge of the feel∣ings of others, by what we might feel if in their place. However dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes, yet the animal itself, finds the apartment sufficiently lightsome. And to confess a truth, this man's mind seems fitted to his station; for I never heard any one more sprightly than he was to-day, when he conversed with you.</Q> —This was said without the least de∣sign, however it excited a blush, which she strove to cover by an affected laugh, assuring him that she scarce took any notice of what he said to her; but that she believed he might once have been a very fine gentle∣man. The readiness with which she undertook to vin∣dicate herself, and her blushing were symptoms I did not internally approve; but I represt my suspicions.</P>
<P>As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make the venison pasty; Moses sat reading, while I taught the little ones: my daughters seemed e∣qually busy with the rest; and I observed them for a good while cooking something over the fire. I at first
<PB N="28" REF="012405_0027_0F8972ADB3EA34F8"/>
supposed they were assisting their mother; but little Dick informed me in a whisper, that they were making a <HI>wash</HI> for the face. Washes of all kinds I had a natural anti∣pathy to; for I knew, that instead of mending the com∣plexion, they spoiled it. I therefore approached my chair by sly degrees to the fire, and grasping the poker, as if it wanted mending, seemingly by accident, over∣turned the whole composition, and it was too late to be∣gin another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A town wit described. The dullest fellows may learn to be comical for a night or two.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord, it may be easily supposed what provisions were exhausted to make an appearance. It may also be conjectured, that my wife and daughters expanded their gayest plumage upon this occasion. Mr. Thornhill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain and feeder. The servants, who were nu∣merous, he politely ordered to the next ale-house: but my wife, in the triumph of her heart, insisted on enter∣taining them all; for which, by the bye, the family was pinched for three weeks after. As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us the day before, that he was making some proposals of marriage to Miss Wilmot, my son George's former mistress, this a good deal damped the heartiness of his reception: but accident, in some measure relieved our embarrassment; for one of the company happening to mention her name, Mr. Thornhill observed with an oath, that he never knew any thing more absurd than calling such a fright a beauty: "for strike me ugly," continued he,
<Q>if I should not find as much pleasure in choosing my mistress by the information of a lamp un∣der the clock at St. Dustan's.</Q> At this he laughed, and so did we:—the jests of the rich are ever successful.
<PB N="29" REF="012405_0028_0F8972AE74FF0440"/>
Olivia too, could not avoid whispering, loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour.</P>
<P>After dinner, I began with my usual toast, the church; for this I was thanked by the chaplain, as he said the church was the only mistress of his affecti∣ons. —"Come tell us honestly, Frank," said the 'Squire, with his usual archness, "suppose the church, your present mistress, drest in lawn sleeves, on one hand, and Miss Sophia, with no lawn about her on the other, which would you be for?" "For both, to be sure," cried the chaplain.—"Right Frank," cried the 'Squire; "for may this glass suffocate me but a fine girl is worth all the priestcraft in the na∣tion. For what are tythes and tricks but an impo∣sition, all a confounded imposture, and I can prove it." —"I wish you would," cried my son Moses, "and I think," continued he, "that I should be able to combat in the opposition."—"Very well, Sir," cried the 'Squire, who immediately smoaked him, and winking on the rest of the company, to prepare us for the sport, "if you are for a cool argument upon that subject, I am ready to accept the challenge. And first, whether are you for managing it analogically, or dialogically? "I am for managing it rationally," cried Moses, quite happy at being permitted to dispute. "Good again," cried the 'Squire, and firstly, of the first. I hope you'll not deny that whatever is is. If you dont grant me that, I can go no further."—Why," return'd Moses, "I think I may grant that, and make the best of it."—"I hope too," returned the other, "you'll grant that a part is less than the whole." "I grant that too," cried Moses, "it is but just and rea∣sonable." —"I hope, cried the 'Squire, "you will not deny, that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones."—"Nothing can be plainer," return'd t'other, and looked round with his usual importance.—"Very well," cried the 'Squire speaking very quick, "the premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe, that the concatenation of self existences, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally produce a problematical dialogism, which in some measure proves that the essence of spirituality may
<PB N="30" REF="012405_0029_0F8972AF333D10C0"/>
be referred to the second predicable."—"Hold, hold," cried the other, "I deny that: Do you think I can thus tamely submit to such heterodox doctrines?" —"What," replied the 'Squire, as if in a passi∣on, "not submit! Answer me one plain question; Do you think Aristotle right when he says, that relatives are related?" undoubtedly," replied the other.— "If so then," cried the 'Squire, "answer me directly to what I propose; Whether do you judge the analyti∣cal investigation of the first part of my enthymem defici∣ent secundum quoad, or quoad minus, and give me your reasons, too: give me your reasons I say, directly," "I protest," cried Moses, I don't rightly comprehend the force of your reasoning; but if it be reduced to one sim∣ple proposition, I fancy it may have an answer,"—"O then sir," cried the 'Squire, "I am your most humble servant, I find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellects both. No, Sir, there I protest you are too hard for me." This effectually raised the laugh against poor Moses, who sate the only dismal figure in a groupe of merry faces: nor did he offer a single syllable more dur∣ing the whole entertainment.</P>
<P>But though all this gave me no pleasure, it had a very different effect upon Olivia, who mistook this humour, which was a mere act of the memory, for real wit. She thought him therefore a very fine gentleman: and such as consider what powerful ingredients a good figure, fine cloaths, and fortune, are in that character, will easily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill notwithstanding his real ignorance, talked with ease, and could expatiate upon the common topics of conversation with fluency. It is not surprising then, that such talents should win the af∣fections of a girl, who by education was taught to value an appearance in herself, and consequently to set a value upon it when found in another.</P>
<P>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and conversation to Olivia, it was no longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him to be our visitor. Nor did she seem to be much displeased at the innocent raillery of her brother and sister upon this occasion. Even Deborah herself seemed to share the
<PB N="31" REF="012405_0030_0F8972AFF1E8FE28"/>
glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were her own. "And now, my dear," cried she to me, "I'll fairly own, that it was I that instructed my girls to encourage our landlord's addresses. I had al∣ways some ambition, and you now see that I was right; for who knows how this may end?" Ay, who knows that indeed? answered I, with a groan: "for my own part I don't much like it; and I could have been better pleased with one that was poor and honest, than this fine gentleman with his fortune and infidelity, for depend on't; if he be what I suspect him, no free-thinker shall ever have a child of mine.</P>
<P>"Sure, father," cried Moses, "you are too severe in this; for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does. Every man has a thou∣sand vicious thoughts, which arise without his power to suppress. Thinking freely of religion, may be invo∣luntary with this gentleman; so that allowing his senti∣ments to be wrong, yet as he is purely passive in their re∣ception, he is no more to be blamed for their incursions, than the governor of a city without walls for the shelter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy."</P>
<P>"True, my son," cried I; "but if the governor in∣vites the enemy, there he is justly culpable. And such is always the case with those who embrace error. The vice does not lie in assenting to the proofs they see; but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer. Like corrupt judges on a bench, they determine right on that part of the evidence they hear; but they will not hear all the evidence. Thus, my son, though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in forming them, we deserve punishment for our v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or contempt for our folly."</P>
<P>My wife now kept up the conversation, though not the argument: she observed, that several very prudent men of our acquaintance were free thinkers, and made very good husbands; and she knew some sensible girls, that had skill enough to make converts of their spouses: "And who knows, my dear," continued she, "what Olivia may be able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o? The girl has a great deal to
<PB N="32" REF="012405_0031_0F8972B17ABF7D60"/>
say upon every subject, and to my knowledge is very well skilled in controversy."</P>
<P>"Why, my dear, what controversy can she have read?" cried I. "It does not occur to my memory that I ever put such books into her hands: you certainly over-rate her merit," "Indeed, papa, replied Olivia, "she does not: I have read a great deal of controversy. I have read the disputes between Thwackum and Square; the controversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday the savage, and I am now employed in reading the con∣troversy in the Religious courtship."—"Very well," cried I, "that's a good girl, I find you are perfectly qualified for making converts, and so go help your mo∣ther to make the gooseberry-pye."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. An amour, which promises little good fortune, yet may be productive of much.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning we were again visited by Mr. Burchell, though I began, for certain rea∣sons, to be displeased with the frequency of his re∣turn; but I could not refuse him my company and fire-side. It is true, his labour more than requited his entertainments; for he wrought among us with vigour, and either in the meadow or at the hay-rick, put himself foremost. Besides, he had always something amusing to say, that lesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed our toil, and was at once so out of the way, and yet so sensible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him. My only dislike arose from an attach∣ment he discovered to my daughter: he would, in a jesting manner, call her his little mistress, and when he bought each of the girls a set of ribbands, her'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the finest. I knew not how, but he every day seemed to become more amiable, his wit to improve, and his simplicity to assume the superior airs of wis∣dom.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="012405_0032_0F8972B282CDE540"/>Our family dined in the field, and we sate, or rather reclined, round a temperate repast, our cloth spread up∣on the hay, while Mr. Burchel seemed to give chear∣fulness to the feast. To heighten our satisfaction two blackbirds answered each other from opposite hedges, the familiar red-breast came and pecked the crumbs from our hands, and every sound seemed but the echo of tranquillity. "I never sit thus," says Sophia, "but I think of the two lovers, so sweetly described by Mr. Gay, who were struck dead in each other's arms under a barley mow. There is something so pathetic in the description, that I have read it an hun∣dred times with new rapture."—"In my opinion," cried my son, "the finest strokes in that description, are much below those in the Acis and Galatea of Ovid. The Roman poet understands the use of <HI>contrast</HI> better, and upon that figure artfully managed all strength in the pa∣thetic depends."—"It is remarkable," cried Mr. Burchell, "that both the poets you mention, have e∣qually contributed to introduce a false taste into their re∣spective countries, by loading all their lines with epithet. Men of little genius found them most easily imitated in their defects, and English poetry, like that in the latter empire of Rome, is nothing at present but a combination of luxuriant images, without plot or connexion; a string of epithets that improve the sound, without carrying on the sense. But, perhaps, madam, while I thus repre∣hend others, you'll think it just that I should give them an opportunity to retaliate, and indeed I have made this remark, only to have an opportunity of introducing to the company a ballad, which, whatever be its other de∣fects, is, I think, at least free from those I have menti∣oned."</P>

<L>"TURN, gentle hermit of the dale,</L>
<L>"And guide my lonely way,</L>

<L>"Where wilds immeasurably spread,</L>
<L>"Seem lengthening as I go."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Forbear, my son," the hermit cries,</L>
<L>"To tempt the dangerous gloom;</L>
<L>"For yonder phantom only flies</L>
<L>"To lure thee to thy doom.</L>

<L>"Here to the houseless child of want,</L>

<P><PB N="38" REF="012405_0037_0F8972B5F34CEB58"/>While this ballad was reading, Sophia seemed to fix an ear of tenderness with her approbation. But our tran∣quillity was soon disturbed by the report of a gun just by us, and immediately after a man was seen bursting thro' the hedge, to take up the game he had killed. This sportsman was the 'Squire's chaplain, who had shot one of the black birds that so agreeably entertained us. So loud a report, and so near, startled my daughters; and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown herself into Mr. Burchell's arms for protection. The gen∣tleman came up, and asked pardon for having disturbed us, affirming that he was ignorant of our being so near. He therefore sate down by my youngest daughter, and, sportsman like, offered her what he had killed that morn∣ing. She was going to refuse, but a private look from her mother soon induced her to correct the mistake, and accept his present, though with some reluctance. My wife, as usual discovered her pride in a whisper, observ∣ing, that Sophy had made a conquest of the chaplain, as well as her sister had of the 'Squire. I suspected how∣ever, with more probability, that her affections were placed upon a different object. The chaplain's errand was to inform us, that Mr. Thornhill had provided mu∣sic and refreshments, and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moon-light, on the grass-plot be∣fore our door. "Nor can I deny," continued he, but I have an interest in being first to deliver this message, as I expect for my reward to be honoured with miss Sophia's hand as a partner." To this my girl replied, that she should have no objection, if she could do it with honour: "But here," continued she, "is a gentleman," looking at Mr Burchell▪ "who has been my companion in the task for the day, and it is fit he should share in its amuse∣ments." Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions; but resigned her up to the chaplain, adding, that he was to go that night five miles, being invited to an harvest supper. His refusal appeared to me a little extraordinary, nor could I conceive how so sensible a girl as my youngest, could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune, to a sprightly young fellow of twenty-two. But as men are most capable of distinguishing me∣rit in women, so the ladies often form the truest judg∣ments

upon us. The two sexes seem placed as spies up∣on each other, and are furnished with different abilities, adapted for mutual inspection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Two ladies of great distinction introduced. Superior finery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver seems to confer superior breeding.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Burchell had scarce taken leave, and Sophia consented to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the 'Squire was come, with a crowd of company. Upon our return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly drest, whom he introduced as women of very great distinction and fashion from town. We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately proposed that every gentleman should sit in a lady's lap. This I posi∣tively objected to, notwithstanding a look of disapproba∣tion from my wife. Moses was therefore dispatched to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we were in want of ladies also to make up a set at country dances, the two gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of part∣ners. Chairs and partners were soon provided. The gentlemen returned with my neighbour Flamborough's rosy daughters, flaunting with red top-knots. But there was an unlucky circumstance which was not adverted to; though the Miss Flamboroughs were reckoned the very best dancers in the parish, and understood the jig and the round-about to perfection; yet they were totally unac∣quainted with country dances. This at first discomposed us: however, after a little shoving and dragging, they beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to go merrily on. Our music consisted of two fid∣dles, with a pipe and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bor. The moon shone bright, Mr. Thornhill and my eldest daughter led up the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, to the great delight of the spectators; for the neighbours hearing what was going forward, came flocking about us. My gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moved with so much grace and vivacity, that my wife could not avoid discovering the pride of
<PB N="40" REF="012405_0039_0F8972B772164018"/>
her heart, by assuring me, that though the little chit did it so cleverly, all the steps were stolen from herself. The ladies of the town strove hard to be equally easy, but without success. They swam, sprawled, languished, and frisked; but all would not do: the gazers indeed owned that it was fine; but neighbour Flamborough observed, that Miss Livy's feet seemed as pat to the music as its echo. After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehensive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expressed her sentiments upon this occasion in a very coarse manner, when she observed, that by the <HI>living jingo,</HI> she was all of a muck of sweat. Upon our return to the house, we found a very elegant cold supper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought with him. The conversation at this time was more reserved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade; for they would talk of nothing but high life, and high lived company; with other fashionable topics, such as pic∣tures, taste, Shakespear, and the musical glasses. 'Tis true they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an oath; but that appeared to me as the surest symp∣tom of their distinction, (tho' I am since informed swear∣ing is now perfectly unfashionable.) Their finery, how∣ever, threw a viel over any grossness in their conversati∣on. My daughters seemed to regard their superior ac∣complishments with envy; and what appeared amiss was ascribed to tip-top quality breeding. But the condescen∣sion of the ladies was still superior to their other accom∣plishments. One of them observed, that had miss Olivia seen a little more of the world, it would greatly improve her. To which the other added, that a single winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly assented to both; adding, that there was nothing she more ardently wished, than to give her girls a single winter's polishing. To this I could not help replying, that their breeding was already superior to their fortune; and that greater refinement would only serve to make their poverty ridiculous, and give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess."—"And what pleasures," cried Mr. Thornhill, "do they not deserve, who have so much in their power to bestow? As for my part," continued he, "my fortune is pretty large, love,
<PB N="41" REF="012405_0040_0F8972B8330E4C18"/>
liberty, and pleasure, are my maxims; but curse me if a settlement of half my estate could give my charming Oli∣via pleasure, it should be her's; and the only favour I would ask in return, would be to add myself to the be∣nefit." I was not such a stranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the fashionable cant to disguise the insolence of the basest proposal; but I made an effort to suppress my resentment. "Sir," cried I, "the family which you now condescend to favour with your compa∣ny, has been bred with as nice a sense of honour as you. Any attempts to injure that, may be attended with very dangerous consequences. Honour, Sir, is our only pos∣session at present, and of that last treasure we must be particularly careful."—I was soon sorry for the warmth with which I had spoken this, when the young gentleman, grasping my hand, swore he commended my spirit, though he disapproved my suspicions. "As to your present hint, continued he," "I protest nothing was farther from my heart than such a thought. No, by all that's tempting, the virtue that will stand a regu∣lar siege was never to my taste; for all my amours are carried by a coup de main."</P>
<P>The two ladies, who affected to be ignorant of the rest, seemed highly displeased with this last stroke of free∣dom, and began a very discreet and serious dialogue up∣on virtue: in this my wife, the chaplain, and I, soon joined; and the 'Squire himself was at last brought to confess a sense of sorrow for his former excesses. We talked of the pleasures of temperance, and the sun-shine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was well pleased that my little ones were kept up beyond the usual time to be edified by such good conversation. Mr. Thornhill even went beyond me, and demanded if I had any objec∣tion to giving prayers. I joyfully embraced the proposal, and in this manner the night was passed in a most com∣fortable way, till at last the company began to think of returning. The ladies seemed very unwilling to part from my daughters; for whom they had conceived a par∣ticular affection, and joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home. The 'Squire seconded the proposal, and my wife added her entreaties: the girls
<PB N="42" REF="012405_0041_0F8972B8F7489A68"/>
too looked upon me as if they wished to go. In this per∣plexity I made two or three excuses, which my daughters as readily removed: so that at last I was obliged to give a preremptory refusal; for which we had nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day ensuing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The family endeavours to cope with their betters. The miseries of the poor when they attempt to appear above their circumstances.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW began to find that all my long and painful lec∣tures upon temperance, simplicity and contentment, were entirely disregarded. The distinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which I had laid asleep, but not removed. Our windows now again, as formerly, were filled with washes for the neck and face. The sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without doors, and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion within. My wife observed, that rising too early would hurt her daughter's eyes, that working after dinner would redden their noses, and convinced me, that the hands never looked so white as when they did nothing. Instead therefore of finishing George's shirts we now had them new modelling their old Gauzes, or flourishing upon cat∣gut. The poor Miss Flamboroughs, their former gay companions, were cast off as mean acquaintance, and the whole conversation ran upon high life and high lived company, with pictures, taste, Shakespear, and the mu∣sical glasses.</P>
<P>But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune- telling gypsey come to raise us into perfect sublimity. The tawny sybil no sooner appeared, than my girls came running to me for a shilling a-piece to cross her hand with silver. To say the truth, I was tired of being always wise, and could not help gratifying their request, be∣cause I loved to see them happy. I gave each of them
<PB N="43" REF="012405_0042_0F8972B9B200BC48"/>
a shilling; though, for the honour of the family, it must be observed, that they never went without money them∣selves, as my wife always generously let them have a guinea each, to keep in their pockets: but with strict injunctions never to change it. After they had been clo∣setted up with the fortune-teller for some time, I knew by their looks, upon their returning, that they had been promised something great.—"Well, my girls, how "have you sped? Tell me, Livy, has the fortune-tel∣ler given thee a pennyworth?"—"I protest, papa," says the girl with a serious face, "I believe she deals with some body that's not right; for she positively de∣clared, that I am to be married to a great 'Squire in less than a twelve-month?—"Well now Sophy, my child," said I, "and what sort of a husband are you to have?" "Sir, replied she, "I am to have a Lord soon after my sister has been married to the 'Squire."— "How," cried I, "is that all you are to have for your "two shillings! Only a Lord and a 'Squire for two shil∣lings! You fools, I could have promised you a prince and Nabob for half the money."</P>
<P>This curiosity of theirs, however was attended with very serious effects; we now began to think ourselves de∣signed by the stars for something exalted, and already anticipated our future grandeur."</P>
<P>It has been a thousand times observed, and I must ob∣serve it once more, that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view, are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition. In the first case we cook the dish to our own appetite; in the latter nature cooks it for us. It is impossible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we call up for our entertainment. We looked upon our fortunes as once more rising; and as the whole parish asserted that the 'Squire was in love with my daughter, she was actually so with him; for they persuaded her into passion. In this agreeable interval, my wife had the most luckly dreams in the world, which she took care to tell us every morning, with great solemnity and exact∣ness. It was one night a coffin and cross bones, the sign of an approaching wedding, at another time she imagin∣ed her daughter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pockets filled with farthings, a certain sign of their being one day stuffed with gold. The girls
<PB N="44" REF="012405_0043_0F8972BA71E51DF8"/>
had their omens too: they felt strange kisses on their lips; they saw rings in the candle, purses bounced from the fire, and true love-knots lurked at the bottom of eve∣ry tea-cup.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the week we received a card from the town ladies; in which, with their compliments, they hoped to see all our family at church the Sunday follow∣ing. All Saturday morning I could perceive, in conse∣quence of this, my wife and daughters in close conference together, and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be sincere, I had strong suspicions that some absurd proposal was preparing for appearing with splendor the next day. In the evening they began their operations in a very regular manner, and my wife undertook to conduct the siege. After tea, when I seemed in spirits, she began thus—"I fancy, Charles, my dear, we shall have a great deal of good company at our church to-morrow."—"Perhaps we may, my dear," returned I; though you need be under no uneasiness about that, you shall have a sermon whether there be or not."—"That is what I expect," returned she; "but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently as possible, for who knows what may happen?" "Your precautions," replied I, "are highly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me. We should be devout and humble, chear∣ful and serene."—"Yes," cried she, "I know that: but I mean we should go there in as proper a manner as possible; not altogether like the scrubs about us." "You are quite right, my dear," returned I, "and I was going to make the very same proposal. The proper manner of going is, to go there as early as possible, to have time for meditation before the service begins."—"Phoo, Charles," interrupted she, "all that is very true; but not what I would be at. I mean, we should go there genteelly. You know the church is two miles off, and I protest I don't like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all blouzed and red with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a smock race. Now, my dear, my proposal is this: there are our two plow horses, the colt that has been in our fa∣mily these nine years, and his companion Blackberry, that
<PB N="45" REF="012405_0044_0F8972BBF9BDA978"/>
that have scarce done an earthly thing for this month past, and are both grown fat and lazy. Why should not they do something as well as we? And, let me tell you, when Moses has trimmed them a little, they will not be so contemptible."</P>
<P>To this proposal I objected, that walking would be twenty times more genteel than such a paltry conveyance, as Blackberry was wall-eyed, and the Colt wanted a tail: that they had never been broke to the rein; but had an hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one saddle and pillion in the whole house. All these objections, however were over-ruled; so that I was obliged to com∣ply. The next morning I perceived them not a little busy in collecting such materials as might be necessary for the expedition; but as I found it would be a business of much time, I walked on to the church before, and they promised speedily to follow. I waited near and hour in the reading desk for their arrival; but not finding them come as expected, I was obliged to begin, and went through the service, not without some uneasiness at find∣ing them absent. This was encreased when all was fi∣nished, and no appearance of the family. I therefore walked back by the horseway, which was five miles round, though the foot-way was but two, and when got about half way home, perceived the procession marching slowly forward towards the church; my son, my wife, and the two little ones exalted upon one horse, and my two daughters upon the other. I demanded the cause of their delay; but I soon found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road. The horses had at first refused to move from the door, till Mr. Bur∣chell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel. Next the straps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the horses took it into his head to stand still, and neither blows nor entreaties could prevail with him to proceed. It was just recovering from this dismal situ∣ation that I found them; but perceiving every thing safe, I own their present mortification did not much dis∣please me, as it might give me many opportunities of fu∣ture triumph and teach my daughters more humility.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The family still resolves to hold up their heads.</HEAD>
<P>ALLHALOWS eve happening on the next day, we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifications had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have re∣jected such an invitation with contempt: however, we suffered ourselves to be happy. Our honest neighbour's goose and dumplings were fine, and the lamb's-wool, e∣ven in the opinion of my wife, who was a connoisseur, was thought excellent. It is true, his manner of telling stories was not quite so well. They were very long, and very dull, and all about himself, and we had laugh∣ed at them ten times before: however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</P>
<P>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of seeing some innocent amusement going forward, and set the boys and girls to blind man's buff. My wife too was persuaded to join in the diversion, and it gave me pleasure to think she was not yet too old. In the mean time, my neighbour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and praised our own dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles succeeded next, questions and commands followed that, and last of all, they sate down to hunt the slipper. As every person may not be accquainted with this primaeval pastime, it may be necessary to observe, that the company at this play plant themselves in a ring upon the ground, all, except one who stands in the mid∣dle, whose business it is to catch a shoe, which the com∣pany shove about under their hams from one to another, something like a weaver's shuttle. As it is impossible▪ in this case for the lady who is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side least ca∣pable of making a defence. It was in this manner that
<PB N="47" REF="012405_0046_0F8972BD73EEA998"/>
my eldest daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in spirits, and bawling for fair play, fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad singer, when, confusion on confusion, who should enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town, Lady Blarny and Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs! Description would but beggar, therefore it is unneces∣sary to describe this new mortification. Death! To be seen by ladies of such high breeding in such vulgar atti∣tudes! Nothing better could ensue from such a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's proposing. We seemed struck to the ground for some time, as if actually petrifi∣ed with amazement.</P>
<P>The two ladies had been at our house to see us, and finding us from home, came after us hither, as they were uneasy to know what accident could have kept us from church the day before. Olivia under∣took to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a summary way, only saying, "We were thrown from our horses." At which account the ladies were greatly concerned: but being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad: but being informed that we were almost killed by the fright, they were vast∣ly sorrow; but hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again. Nothing could exceeed their complaisance to my daughters; their professions the last evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They protested a desire of having a more lasting acquain∣tance. Lady Blarny was particularly attached to Oli∣via; Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her sister. They supported the conversation between themselves while my daughters sate silent, admiring their exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly him∣self is fond of high lived dialogues, with anecdotes of Lords, Ladies, and Knights of the Garter, I must beg leave to give him the concluding part of the present con∣versation.</P>
<P>"All that I know of the matter," cried Miss Skeggs, "is this, that it may be true, or it may not be true: but this I can assure your Ladyship, that the whole rout was in amaze; his Lordship turned all manner of colours,
<PB N="48" REF="012405_0047_0F8972BE329C2188"/>
my lady fell into a swoon; but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his sword, swore he was her's to the last drop of his blood."</P>
<P>"Well replied our Peeress, "this I can say, that the Dutchess never told me a syllable of the matter, and I believe her Grace would keep nothing a secret from me. But this you may depend upon as fact, that the next morning my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet de chambre, Jernigan, Jernigan Jernigan, bring me my garters."</P>
<P>But previously I should have mentioned the very im∣polite behaviour of Mr. Burchell, who, during this dis∣course, sate with his face turned to the fire, and at the conclusion of every sentence would cry out <HI>fudge,</HI> an ex∣pression which displeased us all, and in some measure damped the rising spirit of the conversation.</P>
<P>"Besides, my dear Skeggs," continued our Peeress, "there is nothing of this in the copy of verses that Dr. Burdock made upon the occasion."</P>
<P>"I am surprized at that," cried Miss Skeggs; "for he seldom leaves any thing out, as he writes only for his own amusement. But can your Ladyship favour me with a sight of them?"</P>
<P>"My dear creature," replied our Peeress, "do you think I carry such things about me? Though they are very fine to be sure, and I think myself something of a judge; at least I know what pleases myself. Indeed I was ever an admirer of all doctor Burdock's little pieces; for except what he does, and our dear Countess at Ha∣nover-Square, there's nothing comes out but the most lowest stuff in nature; not a bit of high life among them."</P>
<P>"Your Ladyship should except," says t'other, 'your own things in the Lady's Magazine. I hope you'll say there's nothing low lived there; but I suppose we are to have no more from that quarter."</P>
<P>"Why, my dear," says the lady, "you know my reader and companion has left me, to be married to cap∣tain Roach, and as my poor eyes won't suffer me to write myself, I have been for some time looking out for ano∣ther. A proper person is no easy matter to find, and to be sure thirty pounds a year is a small stipend for a well bred girl of character, that can read, write, and behave
<PB N="49" REF="012405_0048_0F8972BEF39D4990"/>
in company; as for the chits about town, there is no bearing them about one.</P>
<P>"That I know," cried Miss Skeggs, by experience. For of the three companions I had this last half year, one of them refused to do plain work an hour in the day, another thought twenty-five guineas a year too small a salary, and I was obliged to send away the third, be∣cause I suspected an intrigue with the chaplain. Virtue, my dear Lady Blarny, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found?"</P>
<P>My wife had been for a long time all attention to this discourse; but was particularly struck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds and twenty-five guineas a year, made fifty-six pounds five shillings English money, all which was in a manner going a-begging, and might ea∣sily be secured in the family. She for a moment studied my looks for approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion, that two such places would fit our two daugh∣ters exactly. Besides, if the 'Squire had any real affec∣tion for my eldest daughter, this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife therefore was resolved that we should not be deprived of such advantages for want of assurance, and undertook to harrangue for the family. "I hope," cried she, your Ladyships will pardon my present presumption. It is true, we have no right to pretend to such favours; but yet is natural for me to wish putting my children for∣ward in the world. And I will be bold to say, my two girls have had a pretty good education, and capacity, at least the country can't shew better. They can read, write, and cast accompts; they understand their needle, breadstich, cross and change, and all manner of plain work; they can pink, point, and frill; and know some∣thing of music; they can make up small cloaths, work upon catgut; my eldest can cut paper, and my younge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards▪</P>
<P>When she had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in si∣lence, with an air of doubt and importance. At l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Miss Carolina Wielmina Amelia Skeggs condescended to observe, that the young ladies from the opinion she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form of them from so slight an accquaintance, seem∣ed
<PB N="50" REF="012405_0049_0F8972BFB39B0F40"/>
very fit for such employments: "But a thing of this kind, Madam," cried she, addressing my spouse, "re∣quires a thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each other. Not Madam," continued she, "that I in the least suspect the young ladies virtue, prudence and discretion; but there is a form in these things, Madam, there is a form."</P>
<P>My wife approved her suspicions very much, observ∣ing, that she was very apt to be suspicious herself; but referred her to all the neighbours for a character: but this our Peeress declined as unnecessary, alledging that her cousin Thornhill's recommendation would be suffici∣ent, and upon this we rested our petition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Fortune seems resolved to humble the family of Wake∣field. Mortifications are often more painful than real calamities.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we were returned home, the night was dedicated to schemes of future conquest. De∣borah exerted much sagacity in conjecturing which of the two girls was likely to have the best place, and most op∣portunities of seeing good company. The only obstacle to our preferment was in obtaining the 'Squire's recom∣mendation; but he had already shewn us too many in∣stances of his friendship to doubt of it now. Even in bed my wife kept up the usual theme: "Well, faith, my dear Charles, between ourselves, I think we have made an excellent day's work of it."—"Pretty well,"— cried I, not knowing what to say.—"What, only pretty well!" returned she. "I think it is very well. Suppose the girls should come to make accquaintances of taste in town! and this I am assured of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at London is the only place in the world for all manner of husbands. Besides, my dear, stranger things ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen every day: and as ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality be! Entre nous, I protest I like my lady Blarny vastly, so very obliging. However, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="51" REF="012405_0050_0F8972C0730AC5C0"/>
Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you saw how at once▪ I nailed them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?—" Ay," returned I, not knowing well what to think of the mat∣ter, heaven grant they may both be the better for it this day three months!" This was one of those observa∣tions I usually made to impress my wife with an opinion of my sagacity; for if the girls succeeded, then it was a pious wish fulfilled: but if any thing unfortunate en∣sued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy. All this conversation, however, was only preparatory to ano∣ther scheme, and indeed I dreaded as much. This was nothing less than, that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper to sell the Colt, which was grown old, at a neighbouring fair, and buy us an horse that would carry single or dou∣ble upon an occasion, and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a visit. This at first I opposed stoutly; but it was as stoutly defended. However, as I weak∣ened, my antagonist gained strength, till at last it was resolved to part with him.</P>
<P>As the fair happened on the following day, I had in∣tentions of going myself; but my wife persuaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home. "No, my dear," said she, "our son Moses is a discreet boy, and can buy and sell to very good advantage; you know all our great bargains are of his purchasing. He always stands out and higgles, and actually tires them till he gets a bargain."</P>
<P>As I had some opinion of my son's prudence, I was willing enough to entrust him with this commission, and the next morning I perceived his sisters mighty busy in fitting out Moses for the fair; trimming his hair, brush∣ing his buckles, and cocking his hat with pins. The business of the toilet being over, we had at last the sa∣tisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the Colt, with a doal box before him to bring home groceries in. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightening, which though grown too short, was much too good to be thrown away. His waistcoat was of gosling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and his sisters had tied his hair with a broad black
<PB N="52" REF="012405_0051_0F8972C137CADE10"/>
riband. We all followed him several paces from the door, bawling after him good luck, good luck, till we could see no him longer.</P>
<P>He was scarce gone, when Mr. Thornhill's butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune, saying that he overheard his young master mention our names with great commendations.</P>
<P>Good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone. Another footman from the same family followed with a card for my daughters, importing, that the two ladies had received such a pleasing account from Mr. Thorn∣hill of us all, that after a few previous enquires more they hoped to be perfectly satisfied. "Ay," cried my wife, "I now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the great; but when one once gets in, then as Moses says, they may go sleep." To this piece of humour, for she intended it for wit, my daughters assented with a loud laugh of pleasure. In short, such was her satisfac∣tion at this message, that she actually put her hand to her pocket, and gave the messenger seven pence halfpenny.</P>
<P>This was to be our visiting-day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each, which my wife undertook to keep for them, and gave them by letters at a time.. He brought my daughters also a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, snuff, patch∣es or even mony, when they got it. My wife was usu∣ally fond of a weesel skin purse, as being the most lucky; but this by the bye. We had still a regard for Mr. Bur∣chell, though his late rude behaviour was in some mea∣sure displeasing: nor could we now avoid communicat∣ing our happiness to him, and asking his advice: al∣though we seldom followed advice, we were all ready e∣nough to ask it. When he read the note from the two ladies, he shook his head, and observed, that an affair of this sort demanded the utmost circumspection.—This air of diffidence highly displeased my wife. "I never doubt∣ed, Sir," cried she, "your readiness to be against my daughters and me. You have more circumspection than is wanted. However, I fancy when we come to ask ad∣vice, we will apply to persons who seem to have made use of it themselves."—"Whatever my own cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="53" REF="012405_0052_0F8972C1F3BE1800"/>
may have been, madam," replied he, "is not the pre∣sent question; though as I have made no use of advice myself, I should in conscience give it to those that will." —As I was apprehensive this answer might draw on a repartee, making up by abuse what it wanted in wit, I changed the subject, by seeming to wonder what could keep our son so long at the fair, as it was now almost night-fall.—Never mind our son," cried my wife, de∣pend upon it he knows what he is about. I'll warrant we'll never see him sell his hen of a rainy day. I have seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one. I'll tell you a good story about that, that will make you split your sides with laughing.—But as I live, yonder comes Moses, without an horse, and the box at his back."</P>
<P>As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweat∣ing under the deal box, which he had strapt round his shoulders.—"Welcome, welcome Moses; well, my boy, what have you brought us from the fair?"—"I have brought you myself," cried Moses with a sly look, and resting the box on the dresser.—"Ay Moses cri∣ed my wife, that we know, but where is the horse?" "I have sold him," cried Moses, "for three pounds five shillings and two-pence."—Well done, my good boy," returned she, "I knew you would touch them off. Between ourselves, three pounds five shillings and two-pence is no bad days work. Come, let us have it then."—"I have brought back no money," cried Moses, again. I have laid it all out in a bargain, and here it is," pulling a bundle from his breast: "here they are; a groce of green spectacles, with silver rims and shagreen cases."—"A groce of green spectacles!" re∣peated my wife in a faint voice. And you have part∣ed with the Colt, and brought us back nothing but a groce of green paltry spectacles!"—"Dear, mother," cried the boy, why won't you listen to reason? I had them a dead bargain, or I should not have bought them. The silver rims alone will sell for double the money."— "A fig for the silver rims, cried my wife▪ in a passion: "I dare swear they won't sell for above half the money at the rate of broken silver, five shillings an ounce."— "You need be under no uneasiness," cried I, "about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lling the rims; for I perceive they are only copper
<PB N="54" REF="012405_0053_0F8972C2B1DA3CD0"/>
varnished over."—What," cried my wife, "not silver, the rims not silver!" "No," cried I, "no more silver than your sauce-pan."—"And so," returned she, we have parted with the Colt, and have only got a groce of green spectacles, with copper rims and shagreen cases! A murrain take such trumpery. The blockhead has been imposed upon, and should have known his company better."—"There, my dear," cried I, "you are wrong, he should not have known them at all."—"Marry, hang the ideot," returned she again, "to bring me such stuff, if I had them, I would throw them into the fire." "There again you are wrong, my dear," cried I "for though they be copper we will keep them by us, as cop∣per spectacles, you know, are better than nothing."</P>
<P>By this time the unfortunate Moses was undeceived. He now saw that he had indeed been imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who observing his figure, had mark∣ed him for an easy prey. I therefore asked the circum∣stances of his deception. He sold the horse, it seems and walked the fair in search of another. A reverend looking man brought him to a tent, under a pretence of having one to sell. "Here," continued Moses, we met
<Q>another man, very well drest, who desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these, saying, that he wanted money and would dispose of them for a third of the value. The first gentleman, who pretended to be my friend, whispered me to buy them and cautioned me not to let so good an offer pass. I sent for Mr. Flam∣borough, and they talked him up as finely as they did me, and so at last we were persuaded to buy the two groce between us.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Mr. Burchell is found to be an enemy; for he has the confidence to give disagreeable advice.</HEAD>
<P>OUR family had now made several attempts to be fine; but some unforeseen disaster demolished each as soon as projected. I endeavoured to take the advan∣tage of every disappointment, to improve their good sense in proportion as they were frustrated in ambition. "You see, my children," cried I, "how little is to be got by attempts to impose upon the world, in coping with our betters. Such as are poor and will associate with none but the rich, are hated by those they avoid, and despised by those they follow. Unequal combina∣tions are always disadvantageous to the weaker side: the rich having the pleasure, and the poor the inconvenien∣cies that result from them. But come, Dick, my boy, and repeat the fable that you were reading to-day, for the good of the company."</P>
<P>"Once upon a time," cried the child, "a Giant and a Dwarf were friends, and kept together. They made a bargain that they would never forsake each other, but go seek adventures. The first battle they fought was with two Saracens, and the Dwarf, who was very cou∣rageous, dealt one of the champions a most angry blow. It did the Saracen but very little injury, who lifting up his sword fairly struck off the poor Dwarf's arm. He was now in a woeful plight; but the Giant coming to his assistance, in a short time left the two Saracens dead on the plain, and the Dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of spite. They then travelled on to another adven∣ture. This was against three bloody minded Satyrs, who were carrying away a damsel in distress. The Dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before; but for all that, struck the first blow, which was returned by another,
<PB N="56" REF="012405_0055_0F8972C543920830"/>
that knocked out his eye: but the Giant was soon up with them, and had they not fled, would certainly have killed them every one. They were all very joyful for this victory, and the damsel who was relieved fell in love with the Giant, and married him. They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of robbers. The Giant, for the first time, was foremost now: but the Dwarf was not far behind. The battle was stout and long. Wherever the Giant came, all fell before him; but the Dwarf had like to have been killed more than once. At last the victory declared for the two adventurers; but the Dwarf lost his leg. The Dwarf was now without an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the Giant, who was without a single wound, cri∣ed out to him, Come on my little heroe; this is glorious sport; let us get one victory more, and then we shall have honour for ever. No, cries the Dwarf, who was by this time grown wiser, no, I declare off, I'll fight no more: for I find in every battle, that you get all the ho∣nour and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me."</P>
<P>I was going to moralize this fable, when our attention was called off to a warm dispute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughter's intended expedition to town. My wife very strenuously insisted upon the ad∣vantages that would result from it. Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, dissuaded her with great ardor, and I stood neuter. His present dissuasions seemed but the second part of those which were received with so ill a grace in the morning. The dispute grew high, while poor De∣borah, instead of reasoning stronger, talked louder, and at last was obliged to take shelter from a defeat in cla∣mour. The conclusion of her harangue, however, was highly displeasing to us all: she knew she said, of some who had their own secret reasons for what they advised; but, for her part, she wished such to stay away from her house for the future.—"Madam," cried Burchell, with looks of great composure, which tended to enflame her the more, "as for secret reasons, you are right: I have secret reasons, which I forbear to mention, because you are not able to answer those of which I make no se∣cret: but I find my visits here are become troublesome▪ I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps come once
<PB N="57" REF="012405_0056_0F8972C5B2BDF5B0"/>
more to take a final farewell, when I am quitting the country." Thus saying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia, whose looks seemed to upbraid his precipitancy, prevent his going.</P>
<P>When gone, we all regarded each other for some mi∣nutes with confusion. My wife, who knew herself to be the cause, strove to hide her concern with a forced smile, and an air of assurance, which I was willing to reprove: "How, woman," cried I to her, "is it thus we treat strangers? Is it thus we return their kindness? Be assured, my dear, that these were the harshest words, and to me the most unpleasing that ever escaped your lips!—"Why would he provoke me then," replied she, "but I know the motives of his advice perfectly well. He would prevent my girls from going to town, that he may have the pleasure of my youngest daughter's company here at home. But whatever happens, she shall chuse better company than such low-liv'd fellows as he."—"Low-liv'd, my dear, do you call him," cried I, "it is very possible we may mistake this man's cha∣racter: for he seems upon some occasions the most finish∣ed gentleman I ever knew.—Tell me, Sophia, my girl, has he ever given you any secret instances of his attachment?"—"His conversation with me, Sir," replied my daughter, "has ever been sensible, modest, and pleasing. As to aught else, no, never. Once, in∣deed, I remember to have heard him say, he never knew a woman who could find merit in a man that seemed poor." "Such, my dear," cried I, "is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle. But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of such men, and that it would be even madness to expect happiness from one who has been so very bad an oeconomist of his own. Your mother and I have now better prospects for you. The next winter, which you will probably spend in town, will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</P>
<P>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occasion, I can't pretend to determine; but I was not displeased at the bottom, that we were rid of a guest from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of hospitality went
<PB N="58" REF="012405_0057_0F8972C6723B8EE0"/>
to my conscience a little: but I quickly silenced that monitor, by two or three specious reasons, which served to satisfy and reconcile me to myself. The pain which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong, is soon got over. Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it sel∣dom has justice enough to punish by accusing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Fresh mortifications, or a demonstration that seeming ca∣lamities may be real blessings.</HEAD>
<P>THE journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon, Mr. Thornhill having kindly pro∣mised to inspect their conduct himself, and inform us by letter of their behaviour. But it was thought indispen∣sably necessary that their appearance should equal the greatness of their expectations, which could not be done without some expence. We debated therefore in full council, what were the easiest methods of raising money, or, more properly speaking, what we could most conve∣niently sell. The deliberation was soon finished, it was found that our remaining horse was utterly useless for the plow, without his companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye. It was therefore deter∣mined that we should dispose of him for the purposes a∣bove-mentioned, at the neighbouring fair, and to prevent imposition, that I should go with him myself. Though this was one of the first mercantile transactions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting myself with re∣putation. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps, and as mine was mostly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable sentiments of my worldly wisdom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had
<PB N="59" REF="012405_0058_0F8972C7342993A0"/>
got some paces from the door, called me back, to ad∣vise me, in a whisper, to have all my eyes about me.</P>
<P>I had, in the usual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horse through all his his paces; but for some time had no bidders. At last a chapman ap∣proached, and after he had for a good while exa∣mined the horse round, finding him blind of one eye, would have nothing to say to him: a second came up; but observing he had a spavin, declared he would not take him for the driving home: a third perceiv∣ed he had a windgall, and would bid no money: a fourth knew by his eye, that he had the botts: a fifth, more impertinent than all the rest, wondered what a plague I could do to the fair with a blind, spavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel. By this time, I began to have a most hearty contempt for the poor animal myself, and was almost ashamed at the approach of every new cus∣tomer; for though I did not entirely believe all the fel∣lows told me; yet I reflected that the number of witnes∣ses was a strong presumption they were right, and St. Gregory, upon good works, professes himself to be of the same opinion.</P>
<P>I was in this mortifying situation, when a brother clergyman, an old acquaintance, who had also busi∣ness to the fair, came up, and shaking me by the hand, proposed adjourning to a public-house, and ta∣king a glass of whatever we could get. I readily closed with the offer, and entering an ale-house, we were shewn into a little back room, where there was only a venerable old man, who sat wholly intent o∣ver a large book, which he was reading. I never in my life saw a figure that prepossessed me more fa∣vourably. His locks of silver grey venerably shaded his temples, and his green old age seemed to be the result of health and benevolence. However, his pre∣sence did not interrupt our conversation; my friend and I discoursed on the various turns of fortune we had met: the Whistonian controversy, my last pam∣phlet, the archdeacon's reply, and the hard measure that was dealt me. But our attention was in a short
<PB N="60" REF="012405_0059_0F8972C7F2F83BA8"/>
time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room, respectfully said something softly to the old stranger. "Make no apologies, my child," said the old man, "to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow creatures: take this, I wish it were more: but five pounds will relieve your distress, and you are welcome." The modest youth shed tears of gratitude, and yet his gratitude was scarce equal to mine. I could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevo∣lence pleased me so. He continued to read, and we re∣sumed our conversation, until my companion, after some time, recollecting that he had business to transact in the fair, promised to be soon back; adding, that he always desired to have as much of Dr. Primrose's company as possible. The old gentleman hearing my name mention∣ed, seemed to look at me with attention, and when my friend was gone, most respectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great Primrose, that couragious monogamist, who had been the bulwark of the church. Never did my heart feel sincerer rapture than at that mo∣ment. "Sir," cried I, "the applause of so good a man, as I am sure you are, adds to that happiness in my breast which your benevolence has already excited. You behold before you, Sir, that Doctor Primrose, the monogamist, whom you have been pleased to call great. You here see that unfortunate Divine, who has so long, and it would ill become me to say, successfully, fought against the deuterogamy of the age." "Sir," cried the stranger, struck with awe, "I fear I have been too fa∣miliar; but you'll forgive my curiosity, Sir: I beg par∣don." "Sir," cried I, grasping his hand, "you are so far from displeasing me by your familiarity, that I must beg you'll accept my friendship, as you already have all my esteem."—"Then with gratitude I accept the offer," cried he, squeezing me by the hand, "thou glorious pil∣lar of unshaken orthodoxy; and do I behold—I here interrupted what he was going to say; for tho', as an author, I could digest no small share of flattery, yet now my modesty would permit no more. However, no lov∣ers in romance ever cemented a more instantaneous friend∣ship. We talked upon several subjects: at first I thought he seemed rather devout than learned, and began to think
<PB N="61" REF="012405_0060_0F8972C8B3958D18"/>
he despised all human doctrines as dross. Yet this no way lessened him in my esteem; for I had for some time begun privately to harbour such an opinion myself. I therefore took occasion to observe that the world in general began to be blameably indifferent as to doctrinal matters, and followed human speculations too much.— "Ay, Sir," replied he, as if he had reserved all his learning to that moment, "Ay, Sir, the world is in its dotage, and yet the cosmogany or creation of the world has puzzled philosophers of all ages. What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world? Sanconiathon, Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus, have all attempted it in vain. The latter has these words, <HI>Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan,</HI> which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end. Manetho also, who lived about the time of Nebuchadon-Asser, Asser being a Syriac word, usually applied as a surname to the kings of that country, as Teglat Phael-Asser, Nabon-Asser, he, I say, formed a conjecture e∣qually absurd; for as we usually say, <HI>ek to bib lion ku∣bernetes,</HI> which implies, that books will never teach the world; so he attempted to investigate—But, Sir, I ask pardon, I am straying from the question."—That he actually was; nor could I for my life see how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the busi∣ness I was talking of, but it was sufficient to shew me, that he was a man of letters, and I now reverenced him the more. I was resolved therefore to bring him to the touch-stone; but he was too mild and too gentle to con∣tend for victory. Whenever I made any observation that looked like a challenge to controversy, he would smile, shake his head, and say nothing; by which I understood he could say much, if he thought proper. The subject therefore insensibly changed from the business of anti∣quity to that which brought us both to the fair; mine, I told him, was to sell an horse, and very luckily, indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My horse was soon produced, and in fine we struck a bargain. Nothing now remained but to pay me, and he according∣ly pulled out a thirty pound note, and bid me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand, he ordered the landlady to call up his footman, who
<PB N="62" REF="012405_0061_0F8972C9724BCF08"/>
made his appearance in a very genteel livery. "Here, Abraham," cried he, "go and get gold for this; you'll do it at neighbour Jackson's, or any where." While the fellow was gone, he entertained we with a pathetic harrangue on the great scarcity of silver, which I under∣took to improve, by deploring also the great scarcity of gold; and by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never so hard to be come at as now. Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change, though he had offered half a crown for doing it. This was a very great disappointment to us all; but the old gentleman having paused a little, asked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country: upon replying that he was my next door neighbour, "If that be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase then," returned he, "I believe we shall deal. You shall have a draught upon him, payable at sight; and let me tell you, he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him. Honest Solomon and I have been acquaint∣ed for many years together. I remember, I always beat him at three jumps; but he could hop upon one leg farther than I." A draught upon my neighbour was to me the same as money; for I was sufficiently convinced of his ability: the draught was signed and put into my hands, and Mr. Jenkinson, the old gentleman, his man Abraham, and my horse, old Blackberry, trotted off very well pleased with each other.</P>
<P>Being now left to reflection, I began to recollect that I had done wrong in taking a draught from a stranger, and so prudently resolved upon having back my horse, and following the purchaser. But this was now too late: I therefore made directly homewards, resolving to get the draught changed into money at my friend's as fast as possible. I found my honest neighbour smoaking his pipe at his own door, and informing him that I had a small bill upon him, he read it twice over. "You can read the name, I suppose," cried I, "Ephraim Jenkinson." Yes, returned he, "the name is written plain enough, and I know the gentleman too, the greatest rascal under the canopy of heaven. This is the very same rogue who sold us the spectacles. Was he not a venerable look∣ing
<PB N="63" REF="012405_0062_0F8972CA37AD43F0"/>
man, with grey hair, and no flaps to his pocket-holes? And did he not talk a long string of learning a∣bout Greek and cosmogony and the world?" To this I replied with a groan. "Aye," continued he, "he has but that one piece of learning in the world, and he al∣ways talks it away whenever he finds a scholar in com∣pany: but I know the rogue, and will catch him yet."</P>
<P>Though I was already sufficiently mortified, my great∣est struggle was to come, in facing my wife and daugh∣ters. No truant was ever more afraid of returning to school, there to behold the master's sweet visage, than I was of going home. I was determined, however, to anticipate their fury, by first falling into a passion my∣self.</P>
<P>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way disposed for battle. My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that day to inform them, that their journey to town was entirely over: The two ladies having heard reports of us from some malici∣ous person about us, were that day set out for London. He could neither discover the tendency, nor the author of these: but whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to assure our family of his friendship and protection. I found, there∣fore, that they bore my disappointment with great resig∣nation, as it was eclipsed in the greatness of their own. But what perplexed us most was to think, who could be so base as to asperse the character of a family so harmless as ours, too humble to excite envy, and too inoffensive to create disgust.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. All Mr. Burchell's villainy at once detected. The folly of being over-wise.</HEAD>
<P>THAT evening and a part of the following day was employed in fruitless attempts to discover our enemies: scarce a family in the neighbourhood but in∣curred our suspicions, and each of us had reasons for our
<PB N="64" REF="012405_0063_0F8972CBC3313AF0"/>
opinion best known to ourselves. As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter-case, which he found on the green. It was quickly known to belong to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been seen, and, upon examination, contained some hints upon different subjects; but what particularly engaged our attention, was a sealed note, superscribed, <HI>The Copy of a Letter to be sent to the two Ladies at Thornhill-Castle.</HI> It instantly occured, that he was the base informer, and we deliberated whether the note should not be broke open. I was against it; but Sophia, who said she was sure, that of all men, he would be the last to be guilty of so much baseness, insist∣ed upon its being read. In this she was seconded by the rest of the family, and, at their joint solicitation, I read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from whom this comes: one at least the friend of innocence, and ready to prevent its being se∣duced. I am informed for a truth, that you have some intentions of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have some knowledge of, under the character of com∣panions. As I would neither have simplicity imposed upon, nor virtue contaminated. I must offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of such a step will be at∣tended with dangerous consequences. It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with severity; nor should I now have taken this method of explaining myself or reproving folly, did it not aim at guilt. Take therefore the admonition of a friend, and seriously reflect on the consequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto resided.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Our doubts were now at an end. There seemed indeed something applicable to both sides in this letter, and its censures might as well be referred to those to whom it was written, as to us; but the malicious meaning was obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had scarce patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the writer with unrestrained resentment, Olivia was equally severe,
<PB N="65" REF="012405_0064_0F8972CCB475FA38"/>
and Sophia seemed perfectly amazed at his baseness. As for my part, it appeared to me one of the vilest instances of unprovoked ingratitude I had met with. Nor could I account for it in any other manner, than by imputing it to his desire of detaining my youngest daughter in the country, to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview. In this manner we all sate ruminating upon schemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came running in to tell us that Mr. Burchell was approaching at the other end of the field. It is easier to conceive than describe the complicated sensations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury, and the pleasure of approach∣ing revenge. Though our intentions were only to up∣braid him with his ingratitude; yet it was resolved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting. For this purpose we agreed to meet him with our usual smiles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindness, to amuse him a little; but then in the midst of the flat∣tering calm to burst upon him like an earthquake, and overwhelm him with the sense of his own baseness. This being resolved upon, my wife undertook to manage the business herself, as she really had some talents for such an undertaking. We saw him approach, he entered, drew a chair, and sate down.—"A fine day, Mr. Burchell." "A very fine day, Doctor; though I fancy we shall have some rain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the shooting of my corns."—"The shooting of your horns," cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then asked pardon for being fond of a joke.—"Dear madam," replied he, "I pardon you with all my heart; for I protest I should not have thought it a joke till you told me."—" Perhaps not, Sir," cried my wife, "wink∣ing at us, and yet I dare say you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce."—"I fancy, madam,," returned Bur∣chell, "you have been reading a jest book this morning, that ounce of jokes is so very good a conceit; and yet, madam, I had rather see half an ounce of understanding," —"I believe you might," cried my wife, still smiling at us, tho' the laugh was against her; "and yet I have seen some men pretend to understanding that have very little." "And no doubt," replied her antagonist, "you have known ladies set up for wit that had none."—I quickly began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at
<PB N="66" REF="012405_0065_0F8972CD326BD640"/>
this business; so I resolved to treat him in a stile of more severity myself. "Both wit and understanding," cried I, "are trifles, without integrity: it is that which gives value to every character. The ignorant peasant, without fault, is greater than the philosopher with many; for what is genius or courage without an heart? <HI>An honest man is the noblest work of God.</HI>"</P>
<P>"I always held that favourite maxim of Pope," re∣turned Mr. Burchell, "as very unworthy a man of ge∣nius, and a base desertion of his own superiority. As the reputation of books is raised not by their freedom from defect, but the greatness of their beauties; so should that of men be prized, not for their exemption from fault, but the size of those virtues they are possessed of. The scholar may want prudence, the statesman may have pride, and the champion ferocity; but shall we prefer to these men the low mechanic, who laboriously plods on through life, without censure or applause? We might as well prefer the tame correct paintings of the Flemish school to the erroneous, but sublime animations of the Roman pencil."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied I, "your present observation is just, when there are shining virtues and minute defects; but when it appears that great vices are opposed in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues, such a character de∣serves contempt."</P>
<P>"Perhaps," cried he, "there may be some such mon∣sters as you describe, of great vices joined to great vir∣tues; yet in my progress through life, I never yet found one instance of their existence: on the contrary, I have ever perceived, that where the mind was capacious, the affections were good. And indeed, Providence seems kindly our friend in this particular, thus to debilitate the understanding where the heart is corrupt, and diminish the power where there is the will to do mischief. This rule seems to extend even to other animals: the little vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel, and cowardly, whilst those endowed with strength and power are gene∣rous, brave, and gentle."</P>
<P>"These observations found well," returned I, "and yet it would be easy this moment to point out a man," and I fixed my eye stedfastly upon him," whose head and heart
<PB N="67" REF="012405_0066_0F8972CDF257C588"/>
form a most detestable contrast. Ay, Sir, continued I, rai∣sing my voice, "and I am glad to have this opportunity of detecting him in the midst of his fancied security. Do you know this, Sir, this pocket-book?"—"Yes, Sir" returned he with a face of impenetrable assurance, "that pocket-book is mine, and I am glad you have found it."— "And do you know," cried I, "this letter? Nay, ne∣ver falter, man; but look me full in the face: I say, do you know this letter?"—"That letter returned he, "yes, it was I that wrote that letter."—"And how could you," said I, so basely, so ungratefully presume to write this letter?"—"And how came you," replied he, with looks of unparallelled effrontry, "so basely to presume to break open this letter? Don't you know, now I could hang you all for this? All that I have to do, is to swear at the next justice's, that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket book, and so hang you all up at his door." This piece of unexpected insolence, raised me to such a pitch, that I could scarce govern my passion. "Ungrateful wretch, begone, and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness. Begone, and never let me see thee again; go from my doors, and the only punishment I wish thee, is an alarmed conscience, which will be a sufficient tormentor! so saying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a smile, and shutting the clasps with the utmost composure, left us, quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance. My wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make him angry, or make him seem ashamed of his villainies, "My dear," cried I, willing to calm those passions that had been raised too high among us, we are not to be surprised that bad men want shame; they only blush at being detected in doing good, but glory in their vices."</P>
<P>"Guilt and shame says the allegory, were at first com∣panions, and in the beginning of their journey inse∣parably kept together. But their union was soon found to be disagreeable and inconvenient to both; guilt gave shame frequent uneasiness▪ and shame often betrayed the secret conspiracies of guilt. After long disagreement, therefore, they at length consented to part for ever. Guilt boldly walked forward alone, to overtake fate, that went before in the shape of an executioner: but shame
<PB N="68" REF="012405_0067_0F8972CEB2CE7840"/>
being naturally timorous, returned back to keeep compa∣ny with virtue, which, in the beginning of their journey, they had left behind. Thus, my children, after men have travelled through a few stages in vice, they no longer continue to have shame at doing evil, and shame attends only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon their virtues."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. The family use art which is opposed with still greater.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER might have been Sophia's sensations, the rest of the family was easily consoled for Mr. Burchell's absence, by the company of our landlord, whose visits now became more frequent and longer. Though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the town, as he designed, he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He usually came in the morning, and while my son and I followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the fa∣mily at home, and amused them by describing the town, with every part of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere of the play houses, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote, long before they made way into the jest books. The intervals between conversation were employed in teaching my daughters pi∣quet, or sometimes in setting my two little ones to box, to make them <HI>sharp,</HI> as he called it: but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law, in some measure blinded us to all his defects. It must be owned, that my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him, or, to speak it more tenderly, used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea eat short and crisp, they were made by Olivia: if the gooseberry wine was well
<PB N="69" REF="012405_0068_0F8972CF7396ECA8"/>
knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the composition of a pudding, her judgment was infalli∣ble. Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the 'Squire, that she thought him and Olivia extremely like each other, and would bid both stand up to see which was tallest. These instances of cunning, which she thought impenetrable, yet which every body saw thro' were very pleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of his passion, which though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage, yet we thought fell but little short of it; and his slowness was attributed sometimes to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his fear of offending a rich uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened soon after, put it beyond a doubt, that he designed to become one of the family, my wife even regarded it as an absolute promise.</P>
<P>My wife and daughters happening to return a visit to neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and did them for fifteen shillings a head. As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march up∣on us, and notwithstanding all I could say, and I said much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the limner, for what could I do? Our next deliberation was to shew the superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's family, there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven oranges, a thing quite out of taste, no variety in life, no composition in the world. We desired to have something done in a brighter style and, after many debates, at length came to an unanimous re∣solution to be drawn together, in one large historical fa∣mily-piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more gen∣teel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner. As we did not immediately recollect an historical subject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn as independant historical figures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, with a stomacher richly set with diamonds, and her two little ones as Cu∣pids
<PB N="70" REF="012405_0069_0F8972D0333CC688"/>
by her side, while I, in my gown and band, was to present her with my books on the Bangorean controversy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting upon a bank of flowers, drest in a green joseph, laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a shepher∣dess with as many sheep as the painter could spare; and Moses was to be drest out with an hat and white fea∣ther. Our taste so much pleased the 'Squire, that he in∣sisted on being put in as one of the family, in the charac∣ter of Alexander the Great at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to be in∣troduced into the family in reality▪ nor could we refuse his request. The painter was therefore set to work, and as he wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the whole was compleated. The piece was large, and it must be owned he did not spare his colours; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly satisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate circumstance had not occured till the pic∣ture was finished, which now struck us with dismay. It was so very large, that we had no place in the house to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable; but certain it is, we were this time all greatly over seen. Instead therefore of gratify∣ing our vanity as we hoped, there it leaned, in a most mortifying manner, against the kitchen wall, where the canvas was stretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's long-boat, too large to be removed; another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle; some wondered how it should be got out, and still more were amazed how it ever got in.</P>
<P>But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectu∣ally raised more ill-natured suggestions in many. The 'Squire's portrait being found united with ours, was an honour too great to escape envy. Malicious whispers began to circulate at our expence, and our tranquillity continually to be disturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies. These reports we always resented with becoming spirit; but scandal ever improves by opposition. We again there∣fore
<PB N="71" REF="012405_0070_0F8972D0F7909430"/>
entered into a consultation upon obviating the ma∣lice of our enemies and at last came to a resolution which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfac∣tion. It was this: as our principal object was to disco∣ver the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addresses, my wife undertook to sound him, by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of an husband for her eldest daughter. If this was not found sufficient to induce him to a declara∣tion, it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival, which it was thought would compel him, though never so refractory. To this last step, however, I would by no means give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most so∣lemn assurances, that she would marry the person pro∣vided to rival him upon this occasion, if Mr. Thornhill did not prevent it by taking her himself. Such was the scheme laid, which though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not entirely approve.</P>
<P>The next time, therefore that Mr. Thornhill came to see us, my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their mama an opportunity of putting her scheme in execution; but they only retired to the next room, from whence they could over-hear the whole con∣versation; which my wife artfully introduced, by ob∣serving that one of the Miss Flamboroughs was likely to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'Squire assenting, she proceeded to remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands: "But heaven help," continued she, "the girls that have none. What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what signifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of self-interest? It is not, what is she? but what has she? is all the cry."</P>
<P>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the jus∣tice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it should be otherwise. It would then, indeed, be fine times with the girls without fortunes: our two young ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir!" returned my wife, "you are pleased to be facetious: but I wish I were a queen, and then I know where they should look for an husband. But now that you have put it into my head, seriously Mr. Thornhill, can't
<PB N="72" REF="012405_0071_0F8972D1B1BF0FC8"/>
you recommend me a proper husband for my eldest girl? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well edu∣cated, and in my humble opinion, does not want for parts."</P>
<P>Madam, replied he, "if I were to chuse, I would find out a person possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel happy. One with prudence, fortune, taste, and sincerity, such, madam, would be, in my opi∣nion, the proper husband." "Ah, Sir," said she, "but do you know of any such person?"—No, madam," re∣turned he, "it is impossible to know any person that de∣serves to be her husband: she's too great a treasure for one man's possession, she's a goddess. Upon my soul, I speak what I think, she's an angel."—" Ah, Mr. Thorn∣hill, you only flatter my poor girl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, whose mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager: you know whom I mean, farmer Williams: a warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; ay, and who has several times made her proposals: (which was actually the case) but, Sir concluded she, I should be glad to have your approbation of our choice."—"How, madam," replied he, "my approbation! My approba∣tion of such a choice! Never! What! Sacrifice so much beauty, and sense, and goodness, to a creature insensible of the blessing! Excuse me, I can never approve of such a piece of injustice! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have my reasons?"—"Indeed, Sir," cried D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if you have your reasons, that's another affair, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be glad to know those rea∣sons.—"Excuse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> madam," returned he, "they lie too deep for discov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing his hand upon his bosom) they remain burie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivetted here.</P>
<P>After he was gone, upon general consultation we could not tell what to make of these fine sentiments. Oli∣via considered them as instances of most exalted pas∣sion; but I was not quite so saguine: it seemed to be pretty plain, that they had more of love than matrimony in them: yet, whatever they might portend, it was re∣solved to prosecute the scheme of farmer Williams, who, since my daughter's first appearance in the country had paid her his addresses.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Scarce any virtue found to resist the power of long and pleasing temptation.</HEAD>
<P>AS I only studied my child's real happiness, the as∣siduity of Mr. Williams pleased me, as he was in easy circumstances, prudent and sincere. It required but very little encouragement to revive his former pas∣sion; so that in an evening or two after, he and Mr. Thornhill met at our house, and surveyed each other for some time with looks of anger: but Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little regarded his indignation. Olivia, on her side, acted the coquet to perfection, if that might be called acting which was her real charac∣ter, pretending to lavish all her tenderness on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill appeared quite dejected at this preference, and with a pensive air took leave, though I own it puzzled me to find him so much in pain as he appeared to be, when he had it in his power so easily to remove the cause, by declaring an honourable passion. But whatever uneasiness he seemed to endure, it could easily be perceived that Olivia's anguish was still greater. After any of these interviews between her lovers, of which there were several▪ she usually retired to solitude, and there indulged her grief. It was in such a situation I found her one evening, after she had been for some time supporting a fictitious gaiety.—
<Q>You now see, my child,</Q> said I,
<Q>that your confidence in Mr. Thorn∣hill's passion was all a dream: he permits the rivalry of another every way his inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to secure you by a candid declara∣tion of himself.</Q> —"Yes, papa," returned she,
<Q>but he has his reasons for this delay: I know he has. The sincerity of his looks and words convince me of
<PB N="74" REF="012405_0073_0F8972D43AA0C230"/>
his real esteem. A short time, I hope, will discover the generosity of his sentiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just than yours.</Q> — "Olivia, my darling," returned I,
<Q>every scheme that has been hitherto pursued to compel him to a decla∣ration, has been proposed and planned by yourself, nor can you in the least say that I have constrained you. But you must not suppose, my dear, that I will be ever instrumental in suffering his honest rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed passion. Whatever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation shall be granted? but at the expira∣tion of that term, if he is still regardless, I must abso∣lutely insist that honest Mr. Williams shall be re∣warded for his fidelity. The character which I have hitherto supported in life demand this from me, and my tenderness, as a parent, shall never influence my integrity as a man. Name then your day, let it be as distant as you think proper, and in the mean time take care to let Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I design delivering you up to another. If he really loves you, his own good sense will readily suggest that there is but one method alone to prevent his losing you for ever.</Q> —This proposal, which she could not avoid considering as perfectly just, was readily agreed to. She again renewed her most posi∣tive promise of marrying Mr. Williams, in case of the other's insensibility; and at the next opportunity, in Mr. Thornhill's presence, that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival.</P>
<P>Such vigorous proceedings seemed to redouble Mr. Thornhill's anxiety; but what Olivia really sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gave me some uneasiness. In this struggle between prudence and passion, her vivacity quite forsook her, and every oppor∣tunity of solitude was sought, and spent in tears. One week passed away; but her lover made no efforts to re∣strain her nuptials. The succeeding week he was still assiduous; but not more open. On the third he discon∣tinued his visits entirely, and instead of my daughter testifying any impatience, as I expected, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e seemed to retain a pensive tranquillity, which I looked upon as re∣signation. For my own part, I was now sincerely pleased
<PB N="75" REF="012405_0074_0F8972D4B2563718"/>
with thinking that my child was going to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace, and frequently applauded her resolution. It was within about four days of her intended nuptials that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling stories of the past, and laying schemes for the future. Busied in forming a thousand projects, and laughing at whatever folly came uppermost, "Well, Moses," cried I,
<Q>we shall soon, my boy, have a wedding in the family, what is your opinion of matters and things in gene∣ral?</Q> — <Q>My opinion, father, is, that all things go on very well; and I was just now thinking, that when sister Livy is married to farmer Williams, we shall then have the loan of his cyder-press and brew∣ing tubs for nothing.</Q>—"That we shall, Moses," cried I,
<Q>and he will sing us Death and the Lady, to raise our spirits into the bargain.</Q> — <Q>He has taught that song to our Dick,</Q> cried Moses;
<Q>and I think he goes thro' it very prettily.</Q> — <Q>Does he so,</Q> cried I,
<Q>then let us have it: where's little Dick; let him up with it boldly.</Q> —My brother "Dick," cried Bill my youngest,
<Q>is just gone out with sister Livy; but Mr. Williams has taught me two songs, and I'll sing them for you, papa. Which song do you chuse, <HI>the Dying Swan,</HI> or the <HI>Elegy on the death of a mad Dog?</HI></Q>
<Q>The elegy, child by all means,</Q> said I,
<Q>I never heard that yet; and De∣borah, my life, grief you know is dry, let us have a bottle of the best gooseberry wine, to keep up our spirits. I have wept so much at all sorts of elegies of late, that without an enlivening glass I am sure this will overcome me; and Sophy, love, take your guitar, and thrum in with the boy a little.</Q></P>

<L>GOOD people all, of every sort,</L>

<L>And if you find it wond'rous short,</L>
<L>It cannot hold you long.</L>

<LG>
<L>In Islington there was a man,</L>
<L>Of whom the world might say,</L>

<L>Whene'er he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to pray.</L>

<Q>A very good boy, Bill, upon my word, and an elegy that may truly be called tragical. Come, my children, here's Bill's health, and may he one day be a bishop.</Q></P>
<P>"With all my heart," cried my wife;
<Q>and if he but preaches as well as he sings, I make no doubt of him. The most of his family, by the mother's side. could sing a good song: it was a common saying in our country, that the family of the Blenkinsops could never look straight before them, nor the Hugginses blow out a candle; that there were none of the Grograms but could sing a song, or of the Majorams but could tell a story,</Q> —"However that be," cried I,
<Q>the most vulgar ballad of them all generally pleases me better than the fine modern odes, and things that petrify us in a single stanza; productions that we at once detest and praise. Put the glass to your brother, Moses. The great fault of these ele∣gists is, that they are in despair for griefs that give the sensible part of mankind very little pain. A lady loses her lap dog, and so the silly poet runs home to versify the disaster.</Q></P>
<P>"That may be the mode," cried Moses,
<Q>in sub∣blimer compositions; but the Ranelagh songs that come down to us are perfectly familiar, and all cast in the same mould: Collin meets Dolly, and they hold a dialogue together, he gives her a fairing to put in her hair, and she presents him with a nosegay, and then they go together to church, where they give good advice to young nymphs and swains to get married as fast as they can.</Q></P>
<P>"And very good advice too," cried I,
<Q>and I am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as there; for as it persuades us to marry, it also furnishes us with a wife, and surely that must be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told what we want, and sup∣plied with it when wanting.</Q></P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," returned Moses,
<Q>and I know but of two such markets for wives in Europe, Ranelagh in England, and Fontarabia in Spain. The Spanish
<PB N="78" REF="012405_0077_0F8972D6F2024EA0"/>
market is open once a year, but our English wives are saleable every night.</Q></P>
<P>"You are right, my boy," cried his mother,
<Q>Old England is the only place in the world for husbands to get wives.</Q> — <Q>And for wives to manage their husbands,</Q> interrupted I▪
<Q>It is a proverb abroad, that if a bridge were built across the sea, all the la∣dies of the Continent would come over to take pat∣tern from ours; for there are no such wives in Eu∣rope as our own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But let us have one bottle more, Deborah, my life, and Moses give us a good song. What thanks do we not we owe to heaven for thus bestowing tranquillity, health and competence. I think myself happier now than the greatest monarch upon earth. He has no such fire-side, nor such pleasant faces about it. Yes, Deborah, my dear, we are now growing old; but the evening of our life is likely to be happy. We are descended from ancestors that knew no stain, and we shall leave a good and virtuous race of chil∣dren behind us. While we live they will be our sup∣port and our pleasure here, and when we die they will transmit our honour untainted to posterity. Come, my son, we wait for your song: let us have a cho∣rus. But where is my darling Olivia? That little cherub's voice is always sweetest in the concert.</Q>— Just as I spoke Dick came running in— <Q>O papa, papa, she is gone from us, she is gone from us, my sister Livy is gone from us, for ever.</Q> — <Q>Gone, child!</Q> —Yes, she is gone off with two gentlemen in
<Q>a post chaise, and one of them kissed her, and said he would die for her; and she cried very much, and was for coming back; but he persuaded her again and she went into the chaise, and said, O what will my poor papa do when he knows I am undone!</Q> — "Now then," cried I,
<Q>my children, go and be mise∣rable; for we shall never enjoy one hour more. And O may heaven's everlasting fury light upon him and his! Thus to rob me of my child! And sure it will, for taking back my sweet innocent that I was leading up to heaven Such sincerity as my child was possessed of. But all our earthly happiness is now over. Go
<PB N="79" REF="012405_0078_0F8972D7B70BDBA0"/>
my children, go, and be miserable and infamous; for my heart is broken within me!</Q> —"Father," cried, my son, "is this your fortitude?"— <Q>Fortitude, child! Yes, he shall see I have fortitude! Bring me my pistols. I'll pursue the traitor. While he is on earth I'll pursue him. Old as I am, he shall find I can sting him yet. The villain! The persidious villain!</Q> —I had by this time reached down my pistols, when my poor wife, whose passions were not so strong as mine, caught me in her arms.
<Q>My dearest, dearest husband,</Q> cried she,
<Q>the bible is the only weapon that is fit for your old hands now. Open that my love, and read our anguish into patience, for she has vilely deceived</Q> —Her sorrow repressed the rest in silence.—"Indeed, Sir," resumed my son, after a pause,
<Q>your rage is too violent and unbecom∣ing. You should be my mother's comforter, and you encrease her pain. It ill suited you and your reverend character thus to curse your greatest enemy: you should not to have curst the wretch, villain as he is.</Q> —"I did not curse him, child, did I?"— <Q>In∣deed, Sir, you did, you curst him twice.</Q>— <Q>Then may Heaven forgive me and him if I did! And now, my son, I see it was more than human benevo∣lence that first taught us to bless our enemies! Blest be his holy name for all the good he has given, and for that he has taken away. But it is not, it is not a small distress that can wring tears from these old eyes, that have not wept for so many years. My child!— To undo my darling! May confusion seize! Heaven forgive me, what am I about to say! You may remember, my love, how good she was, and how charming; till this vile moment all her care was to make us happy. Had she but died! But she is gone, the honour of our family contaminated, and I must look out for happiness in other worlds than here. But, my child, you saw them go off: perhaps he forced her away? If he forced her, she may yet be innocent.</Q> —"Ah no, Sir!" cried the child,
<Q>he only kissed her, and called her his angel, and she wept very much, and leaned upon his arm, and they drove off very fast.</Q> —"She's an ungrateful creature," cried
<PB N="80" REF="012405_0079_0F8972D871B7A558"/>
my wife, who could scarce speak for weeping,
<Q>to use us thus. She never had the least constraint put upon her affections. The vile strumpet has basely deserted her parents without any provocation, thus to bring your grey hairs to the grave, and I must shortly fol∣low.</Q></P>
<P>In this manner that night, the first of our real mis∣fortunes, was spent in the bitterness of complaint, and ill supported sallies of enthusiasm. I determined, how∣ever, to find out our betrayer, wherever he was, and reproach his baseness. The next morning we missed our wretched child at breakfast, where she used to give life and chearfulness to us all. My wife, as before, at∣tempted to ease her heart by reproaches. "Never," cried she,
<Q>shall that vilest stain of our family again darken those harmless doors. I will never call her daughter more. No, let the strumpet live with her vile seducer: She may bring us to shame, but she shall never more deceive us.</Q></P>
<P>"Wife," said I,
<Q>do not talk thus hardly: my de∣testation of her guilt is as great as yours; but ever shall this house and this heart be open to a poor re∣turning repentant sinner. The sooner she returns from her transgression, the more welcome shall she be to me. For the first time the very best may err; art may persuade, and novelty spread out its charm. The first fault is the child of simplicity; but every other the offspring of guilt. Yes, the wretched creature shall be welcome to this heart and this house, tho' stained with ten thousand vices. I will again hearken to the music of her voice, again will I hang fondly on her bosom, if I find but repentance there. My son, bring hither my bible and my staff; I will pur∣sue her, wherever she is, and tho' I cannot save her from shame, I may prevent the continuance of ini∣quity.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. The pursuit of a father to reclaim a lost child to virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the child could not describe the gentle∣man's person who handed his sister into the post-chaise, yet my suspicions tell entirely upon our young landlord, whose character for such intrigues was but too well known. I therefore directed my steps towards Thornhill-castle. resolving to upbraid him, and, if pos∣sible to bring back my daughter: but before I had reached his seat, I was met by one of my parishioners, who said he saw a young lady resembling my daughter in a post-chaise with a gentleman, whom, by the de∣scription, I could only guess to be Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very fast. This information, however, did by no means satisfy me. I therefore went to the young 'Squire's, and though it was yet early, insisted upon seeing him immediately: he soon appeared with the most open familiar air, and seemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, protesting upon his honour that he was quite a stranger to it. I now therefore con∣demned my former suspicions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who I recollected had of late several private conferences with her: but the appearance of another witness left me no room to doubt of his villainy, who averred, that he and my daughter were actually gone towards the wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of company. Hearing this, I re∣solved to pursue them there. I walked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g with ear∣nestness, and enquired of several by the way, but re∣ceived no accounts, till entering the town, I was met by a person on horseback, whom I remembered to have seen at the Squire's, and he assured me that if I followed them to the races, which were but thirty miles farther, I might depend upon overtaking them; for he had seen them dance there the night before, and the whole as∣sembly
<PB N="82" REF="012405_0081_0F8972DB01B82F80"/>
seemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the next day I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon I came upon the course. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all ear∣nestly employed in one pursuit, that of pleasure; how different from mine, that of reclaiming a lost child to virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell at some dis∣tance from me: but, as if he dreaded an interview, upon my approaching him, he mixed among a crowd, and I saw him no more. I now reflected that it would be to no purpose to continue my pursuit farther, and resolved to return home to an innocent family, who wanted my assistance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone, threw me into a fe∣ver, the symptoms of which I perceived before I came off the course. This was another unexpected stroke, as I was more than seventy miles distant from home: however, I retired to a little ale-house by the road-side, and in this place, the usual retreat of indigence and fru∣gality, I laid me down patiently to wait the issue of my disorder. I languished here for near three weeks; but at last my constitution prevailed, though I was unpro∣vided with money to defray the expences of my enter∣tainment. It is possible the anxiety from this last cir∣cumstance alone might have brought on a relapse, had I not been supplied by a traveller, who stopt to take a cursory refreshment. This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's church-yard, who has written so many little books for children: he called himself their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no sooner alighted, but he was in haste to be gone; for he was ever on business of the utmost importance, and was at that time actually com∣piling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red pimpled face; for he had published for me against the Deuterogamists of the age, and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but weak, I resolved to return home by easy journeys of ten miles a day. My health and usual tranquillity were almost restored, and I now condemned that pride which had made me refractory
<PB N="83" REF="012405_0082_0F8972DB75775508"/>
to the hand of correction. Man little knows what ca∣lamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them; as in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every step we rise shews us some new prospect of hidden disappointment; so in our de∣scent to the vale of wretchedness, which, from the sum∣mits of pleasure appears dark and gloomy, the busy mind still attentive to its own amusement, finds something to flatter and surprise it. Still as we descend, the objects appear to brighten, unexpected prospects amuse, and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation.</P>
<P>I now proceeded forwards, and had walked about two hours, when I perceived what appeared at a dis∣tance like the waggon, which I was resolved to over∣take; but when I came up with it, found it to be a strolling company's cart, that was carrying their scenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit. The cart was attended only by the person who drove it, and one of the company, as the rest of the players were to follow the ensuing day. Good company upon the road, says the proverb, is al∣ways the shortest cut, I therefore entered into conver∣sation with the poor player; and as I once had some theatrical powers myself, I descanted on such topics with my usual freedom: but as I was pretty much unac∣quainted with the present state of the stage, I demanded who where the present theatrical writers in vogue, who the Drydens and Otways of the day.— <Q>I fancy, Sir,</Q> cried the player,
<Q>few of our modern drama∣tists would think themselves much honoured by being compared to the writers you mention. Dryden and Rowe's manner, Sir, are quite out of fashion; our taste has gone back a whole century. Fletcher, Ben Johnson, and all the plays of Shakespeare, are the only things that go down.</Q> —"How," cried I,
<Q>is it possible the present age can be pleased with that anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uated dialect that obsolete humour, those over charged characters, which abound in the works you mentioned?</Q> —"Sir," returned my companion,
<Q>the publick think nothing about dialect, or humour, or character; for that is none of their business, they only go to be amused, and find themselves happy
<PB N="84" REF="012405_0083_0F8972DC321453E8"/>
when they can enjoy a pantomime, under the sanction of Johnson's or Shakespear's name.</Q> — <Q>So then, I suppose,</Q> cried I,
<Q>that our modern dramatists are rather imitators of Shakespeare than of nature.</Q> — "To say the truth," returned my companion,
<Q>I don't know that they imitate any thing at all; nor indeed does the publick require it of them: it is not the com∣position of the piece, but the number of starts and at∣titudes that may be introduced into it that forces ap∣plause. I have known a piece, with not one jest in the whole, shrugged into popularity, and another saved by the poet's throwing in a fit of the gripes. No, Sir, the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the present taste; our modern dialogue is much more natural.</Q></P>
<P>By this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at the village, which, it seems, had been ap∣prised of our approach, and was come out to gaze at us; for my companion observed, that strollers always have more spectators without doors than within. I did not consider the impropriety of my being in such company till I saw a mob gathered about me. I therefore took shelter, as fast as possible, in the first ale-house that of∣fered, and being shewn into the common room, was ac∣costed by a very well-drest gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or whether it was only to be my masquerade character in the play. Upon informing him of the truth, and that I did not belong to the company, he was condescending enough to desire me and the player to partake of a bowl of punch, over which he discussed modern politics with great earnestness and seeming interest. I set him down in my own mind for nothing less than a parliament-man at least; but was almost confirmed in my conjectures, when upon my asking what there was in the house for supper, he insisted that the player and I should sup with him at his house, with which request, after some entrea∣ties, I was prevailed on to comply.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. The description of a person discontented with the pre∣sent government, and apprehensive of the loss of our liberties.</HEAD>
<P>THE house where we were to be entertained, ly∣ing at a small distance from the village, our invi∣ter observed, that as the coach was not ready, he would conduct us on foot, and we soon arrived at one of the most magnificent mansions I had seen in the country. The apartment into which we were shewn was perfectly elegant and modern; he went to give orders for supper, while the player, with a wink, observed that we were perfectly in luck. Our entertainer soon returned, an elegant supper was brought in, two or three ladies, in an easy dishabille, were introduced, and the conversati∣on began with some sprightliness. Politics, however, was the subject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiat∣ed; for he asserted that liberty was at once his boast and his terror. After the cloth was removed, he asked me if I had seen the last Monitor, to which replying in the negative, "What, nor the Auditor, I suppose?" cried he. "Neither, Sir," returned I. "That's strange, very strange," replied my entertainer. Now, I read all the politics that come out. The Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the Whitehall Evening, the seventeen magazines, and the two reviews; and though they hate each other, I love them all. Liberty, Sir, liberty is the Briton's boast, and by all my coal mines in Cornwall, I reverence its guardians." "Then it is to be hoped," cried I, "you reverence the king." "Yes," returned my entertainer, "when he does what we would have him; but if he goes on as he has done of late, I'll never trouble myself more with his matters. I say nothing. I think only. I could have directed some things better. I don't think there has been a sufficient number of advisers; he should
<PB N="86" REF="012405_0085_0F8972DDB38AE2A0"/>
advise, with every person willing to give him advice, and then we should have things done in another manner."</P>
<P>"I wish," cried I, "that such intruding advisers were fixed in the pillory. It should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of our constitution, that sa∣cred power that has for some years been every day de∣clining, and losing its due share of influence in the state. But these ignorants still continue the cry of liberty, and if they have any weight basely throw it into the subsid∣ing scale."</P>
<P>"How," cried one of the ladies, "do I live to see one so base, so sordid, as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants? Liberty, that sacred gift of hea∣ven, that glorious privilege of Britons!"</P>
<P>"Can it be possible, cried our entertainer, "that there should be any found at present advocates for sla∣very? Any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of Britons? Can any, Sir, be so abject?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir," replied I, "I am for liberty, that attri∣bute of Gods! Glorious liberty! that theme of modern declamation. I would have all men kings. I would be a king myself. We have all naturally an equal right to the throne: we are all originally equal. This is my o∣pinion, and was once the opinion of a set of honest men who were called Levellers. They tried to erect them∣selves into a community, where all should be equally free. But alas! it would never answer; for there were some among them stronger, and some more cunning than others, and these became masters of the rest; for as sure as your groom rides your horses, because be is a cun∣ninger animal than they, so surely will the animal that is cunninger animal than they, so surely will the animal that is cunninger or stronger than he, sit upon his shoul∣ders in turn. Since then it is entailed upon humanity to submit, and some are born to command, and others to obey, the question is, as there must be tyrants, whether it is better to have them in the same house with us, or in the same village, or still farther off, in the metropo∣lis. Now, Sir, for my own part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from me, the better pleased am I. The generality of man∣kind also are of my way of thinking, and have unani∣mously
<PB N="87" REF="012405_0086_0F8972DE73459C40"/>
created one King, whose election at once dimi∣nishes the number of tyrants, and puts tyranny at the greatest distance from the greatest number of people. Now those who were tyrants themselves before the elec∣tion of one tyrant, are naturally averse to a power rais∣ed over them, and whose weight must ever lean heaviest on the subordinate orders. It is the interest of the great, therefore, to diminish kingly power as much as possible; because whatever they take from it is naturally restored to themselves; and all they have to do in a state, is to undermine the single tyrant, by which they resume their primaeval authority. Now a state may be so constituti∣onally circumstanced, its laws may be so disposed, and its men of opulence so minded, as all to conspire to carry on this business of undermining monarchy. If the cir∣cumstances of the state be such, for instance, as to fa∣vour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent still more rich, this will encrease their strength and their ambition. But an accumulation of wealth must necessa∣rily be the consequence in a state, when more riches flow in from external commerce, than arise from internal in∣dustry: for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have also at the same time all the emoluments arising from internal industry: so that the rich, in such a state, have two sources of wealth, whereas the poor have but one. Thus wealth in all commercial states is found to accumulate, and such have hitherto in time become aristocratical. Besides this, the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth; as when those natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken, and it is ordained that the rich shall only marry among each other; or when the learned are held unqualified to serve their country as merely from a defect of opulence, and wealth is thus made the object of a wise man's ambition, by these means I say, and such means as these, riches will accumulate. The possessor of accumulated wealth, when furnished with the necessaries and pleasures of life, can employ the superfluity of fortune only in purchasing power. That is, differently speaking, in making de∣pendants, in purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of men who are willing to bear the mortification
<PB N="88" REF="012405_0087_0F8972DF419BFCC0"/>
of contiguous tyranny for bread. Thus every very o∣pulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the poorest of the people; and the polity abounding in accu∣mulated wealth, may be compared to a Cartesian system, each orb with a vortex of its own. Those, however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex, are only such as must be slaves, the rabble of mankind, whose souls and whose education are adapted to servitude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name. But there must still be a large number of the people without the sphere of the opulent man's influence, namely, that order of men which subsists between the very rich and the very rabble; those men who are possessed of two large fortunes to submit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to set up for tyranny them∣selves. In this middle order of mankind are generally to be found all the arts, wisdom, and virtues of society. This order alone is known to be the true preserver of freedom, and may be called the People. Now it may happen that this middle order of mankind may lose all its influence in a state, and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble: for if the fortune suffici∣ent for qualifying a person at present to give his voice in state affairs, be ten times less than was judged sufficient upon forming the constitution, it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political system, and they, ever moving in the vortex of the great, will follow where greatness shall direct. In such a state, therefore, all that middle order has left, is to preserve the prerogative and privileges of one princi∣pal tyrant with the most sacred circumspection. For he divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the middle order placed beneath them. The middle order may be com∣pared to a town of which the opulent are forming the siege, and which the tyrant is hastening to relieve. While the besiegers are in dread of the external enemy, it is but natural to offer the townsmen the most specious terms; to flatter them with sounds, and amuse them with privileges: but if they once defeat the tyrant, the walls of the town will be but a small defence to its inha∣bitants. What they may then expect, may be seen by
<PB N="89" REF="012405_0088_0F8972DFF7EF0010"/>
turning our eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the law. I am then for, and would die for, monarchy, sacred monarchy; for if there be any thing sacred amongst men, it must be the anointed sovereign of his people, and eve∣ry diminution of his power in war, or in peace, is an in∣fringement upon the real liberties of the subject. The sounds of liberty, patriotism, and Britons, have already done <HI>much;</HI> it is to be hoped that the true sons of free∣dom will prevent their ever doing more. I have known many of those bold champions for liberty in my time, yet do I not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</P>
<P>My warmth I found had lengthened this harangue be∣yond the rules of good breeding: but the impatience of my entertainer, who often strove to interrupt it could be restrained no longer. "What," cried he, "then I have been all this while entertaining a Jesuit in parson's cloaths: but by all the coal mines of Cornwall, out he shall pack, if my name be Wilkinson. I now found I had gone too far, and asked pardon for the warmth with which I had spoken. "Pardon," returned he in a fu∣ry: "I think such principles demand ten thousand par∣dons. What, give up liberty, property, and, as the Gazetteer says, lie down to be saddled with wooden shoes! Sir, I insist upon your marching out of this house immediately to prevent worse consequences, Sir, I insist upon it." I was going to repeat my remonstrances; but just then we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two ladies cried out, "As sure as death there is our ma∣ster and mistress come home." It seems my entertainer was all this while only the butler, who, in his master's absence, had a mind to cut a figure, and be for a while the gentleman himself; and to say the truth, he talked politics as well as most country gentleman do. But no∣thing could now exceed my confusion upon seeing the gentleman, with his lady, enter, nor was their surprize, at finding such company and good cheer, less than ours. "Gentlemen," cried the real master of the house, to me and my companion, "I am your most humble ser∣vant; but I protest this is so unexpected a favour, that I almost sink under the obligation." However unexpected
<PB N="90" REF="012405_0089_0F8972E183FEACB0"/>
our company might be to him, his, I am sure, was still more to us, and I was struck dumb with the apprehensi∣ons of my own absurdity, when whom should I next see enter the room but my dear miss Arabella Wilmot, who was formerly designed to be married to my son George; but whose match was broken off, as already related. As soon as she saw me, she flew to my arms with the utmost joy. "My dear sir," cried she, "to what happy acci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent is it that we owe so unexpected a visit? I am sure my uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have the good Dr. Primrose for their guest." Upon hearing my name, the old gentleman and lady very po∣litely stept up, and welcomed me with most cordial hos∣pitality. Nor could they forbear smiling upon being in∣formed of the nature of my present visit: but the unfor∣tunate butler, whom they at first seemed disposed to turn away, was, at my intercession, forgiven.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the house belong∣ed now, insisted upon having the pleasure of my stay for some days, and as their niece, my charming pupil, whose mind, in some measure, had been formed under my own instructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was shewn to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning early, Miss Wilmot desired to walk with me in the garden, which was decorated in the modern manner. After some time spent in pointing out the beauties of the place, she enquired with seeming uncon∣cern, when last I had heard from my son George.
<Q>A∣las! Madam,</Q> cried I,
<Q>he has now been near three years absent, without ever writing to his friends or me. Where he is I know not; perhaps I shall never see him or happiness more. No, my dear Madam, we shall never more see such plea∣sing hours as were once spent by our fire-side at Wakefield. My little family are now dispersing very fast, and poverty has brought not only want, but in∣famy upon us.</Q> The good-natured girl let fall a tear at this account; but as I saw her possessed of too much sensibility, I forbore a more minute detail of our sufferings. It was, however, some consolation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affecti∣ons, and that she had rejected several matches that had
<PB N="91" REF="012405_0090_0F8972E27B728568"/>
been made her since our leaving her part of the country. She led me round all the extensive improvements of the place, pointing to the several walks and arbours, and at the same time catching from every object a hint for some new question relative to my son. In this manner we spent the forenoon, till the bell summoned us in to dinner, where we found the manager of the strolling company, who was come to dispose of tickets for the Fair Penitent, which was to be acted that evening, the part of Horatio by a young gentleman who had never ap∣peared on any stage before. He seemed to be very warm in the praises of the new performer, and averred, that he never saw any who bid so fair for excellence. Acting he observed was not learned in a day;
<Q>But this gentleman,</Q> continued he,
<Q>seems born to tread the stage. His voice, his figure, and attitudes, are all admirable. We caught him up accidentally in our journey down.</Q> This account in some measure, excited our curiosity, and, at the entreaty of the ladies, I was prevailed upon to accompany them to the play∣house, which was no other than a barn. As the com∣pany with which I went was incontestably the chief of the place, we were received with the greatest respect, and placed in the front seat of the theatre; where we sat for some time with no small impatience to see Ho∣ratio make his appearance. The new perfomer ad∣vanced at last, and I found it was my unfortunate son. He was going to begin, when, turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived us, and stood at once speech∣less and immoveable. The actors behind the scenes, who ascribed this pause to his natural timidity, attempt∣ed to encourage him; but instead of going on, he burst into a flood of tears, and retired off the stage. I don't know what were the sensations I felt; for they succeeded with too much rapidity for description: but I was soon awaked from this disagreeable reverie by Miss Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, desired me to conduct her back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a stranger to our extraordinary behaviour, being informed that the new performer was my son, sent his coach, and an in∣vitation, for him; and as he persisted in his refusal to
<PB N="92" REF="012405_0091_0F8972E2F253AEA8"/>
appear again upon the stage, the players put another in his place, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e soon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kindest reception, and I received him with my usual transport; for I could never counterfeit false resentment. Miss Wilmot's reception was mixed with seeming neglect, and yet I could perceive she acted a studied part. The tumult in her mind seemed not yet abated; she said twenty giddy things that looked like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals she would take a sly peep at the glass, as if happy in the consciousness of unresisting beauty, and often would ask questions, without giving any manner of attention to the answers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The history of a philosophic vagabond, pursuing no∣velty, but losing content.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER we had supped, Mrs. Arnold politely of∣fered to send a couple of her footmen for my son's baggage, which he at first seemed to decline; but upon her pressing the request, he was obliged to inform her, that a stick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boast of. "Why, aye, my son," cried I, "you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you have seen a great deal of the world."— "Yes, Sir," replied my son, "but travelling after for∣tune, is not the way to secure her; and, indeed, of late, I have desisted from the pursuit,"—"I fancy Sir," cried Mrs Arnold," "that the account of your adventures would be amusing: the first part of them I have often heard from my niece: but could the company prevail for the rest, it would be an additi∣onal obligation."—"Madam," replied my son, "I can promise you the pleasure you have in hearing, will not be half so great as my vanity in the recital and yet in the whole narrative I can scarce promise you one adventure, as my account is not of what I did, but what I saw. The first misfortune of my life, which you all know was great; but tho' it distressed, it could not sink me. No person ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The less kind I found fortune then, the more I expected from her another time, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not depress me. I proceeded there∣fore, towards London in a fine morning no way uneasy about to morrow, but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road. I comforted myself with various reflections,
<PB N="96" REF="012405_0094_0F8972E532000898"/>
that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward.</P>
<P>"Upon my arrival in town, Sir, my first care was to deliver your letter of recommendation to your cousin who was himself in little better circumstances than me. My first scheme, you know, Sir, was to be the usher at an academy, and I asked his advice on the affair. Our cousin received the proposal with a true Sardonic grin. Aye, cried he, this is a pretty career, indeed, that has been chalked out for you. I have been once an usher at a boarding school myself; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was brow-beat by the master, hated for my ugly face by the mistress, worried by the boys within and ne∣ver permitted to stir out to meet civility abroad. But are you sure you are fit for a school? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the business? No. Then you won't do for a school. Can you dress the boys hair? No. Then you won't do for a school. Have you had the small pox? No. Then you won't do for a school. Can you lie three in a bed? No. Then you will never do for a school? H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve you got a good stomach? Yes. Then you will by no means do for a school. No, Sir, if you are fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> genteel easy profession bind yourself seven years as an apprentice to turn a cut∣ler's wheel; but avoid a school by any means. But come, continued he, I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning, what do you think of commencing au∣thor, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius starving at the trade: but at present I'll shew you forty very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence. All honest jogg trotmen, who go on smoothly and dully, and write history and politics, and are praised; and who, had they been bred coblers, would all their lives have only mended shoes, but never made them."</P>
<P>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an usher, I resolved to accept his proposal; and having the highest respect for literature, I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub-street with reverence. I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dryden
<PB N="97" REF="012405_0095_0F8972E5F1F828F8"/>
and Otway trod▪ before me. In fact, I considered the goddess of this region as the parent of excellence; and however an intercourse with the world might give us good sense, the poverty she granted was the nurse of genius! Big with these reflections, I sat down, and find∣ing that the best things remained to be said on the wrong side, I resolved to write a book that should be wholly new. I therefore drest up three paradoxes with some ingenuity. They were false, indeed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been so often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but some splendid things that at a distance looked every bit as well. Witness you powers what fancied importance sat perched upon my quill while I was writing. The whole learned world, I made no doubt, would rise to oppose my systems; but then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world. Like the porcupine I sat self collected, with a quill pointed against every opposer"</P>
<P>"Well said my boy," cried I, "and what subject did you treat upon? I hope you did not pass over the importance of Hierarchial monogamy. But I interrupt, go on; you published your paradoxes; well, and what did the learned world say to your paradoxes?"</P>
<P>"Sir," replied my son, "the learned world said nothing to my paradoxes? nothing at all, Sir. Every man of them was employed in praising his friends and himself, or condemning his enemies; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I suffered the cruellest mortification, neglect."</P>
<P>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-house on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed himself in the box before me, and after some preliminary discourse, finding me to be a scholar, drew out a bundle of proposals, begging me to subscribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand necessa∣rily produced a reply that I had no money; and that concession led him on to enquire into the nature of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were just as great is my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, I see, cried he, you are unacquainted with the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ I'll teach you a part of it. Look at these proposals, upon these very proposals I have subsist∣ed
<PB N="98" REF="012405_0096_0F8972E6C292C488"/>
very comfortably for twelve years. The moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from her country seat, I strike for a subscription. I first besiege their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my proposals at the breach. If they subscribe readily the first time, I renew my re∣quest to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that, I smite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus, continued he, I live by vanity and laugh at it. But between ourselves, I am now too well known, I should be glad to borrow your face a bit: a nobleman of distinction has just returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this copy of verses, my life for it you succeed, and we divide the spoil."</P>
<P>"Bless us, George," cried I, "and is that the em∣ployment of poets now! Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary! Can they so far disgrace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of praise for bread!"</P>
<P>"O no, Sir," returned he, "a true poet can never be so base; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The creatures I now describe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hardship for fame, so he is equally a coward to contempt, and none but those who are unworthy protection condescend to solicit it."</P>
<P>"Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indig∣nities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a middle course, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profession where mere industry alone could ensure success. I could not suppress my lurking passion for applause: but usually consumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it should have been more advantageously employed in the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would come forth in the midst of a periodical publication, unno∣ticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed, than to observe the easy simplicity of my style, or the harmony of my periods. Sheet after sheet was thrown off to oblivion. My essays were buried a∣mong the essays upon liberty, eastern ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and cures for the bite of a mad dog; while Philau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Philalethes,
<PB N="99" REF="012405_0097_0F8972E771A8FB70"/>
Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, be∣cause they wrote faster, than I."</P>
<P>"Now, therefore, I began to associate with none but disappointed authors, like myself, who praised, deplored, and despised each other. The satisfaction we found in every celebrated writer's attempts, was inversely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort. I could neither read nor write with satisfaction; for excellence in another was my aversi∣on, and writing was my trade."</P>
<P>"In the midst of these gloomy reflections, as I was one day sitting on a bench in St. James's park, a young gentleman of distinction who had been my intimate ac∣quaintance at the university, approached me. We salut∣ed each other with some hesitation, he almost ashamed of being known to one who made so shabby an appear∣ance, and I afraid of a repulse. But my suspicions soon vanished; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</P>
<P>"What did you say, George?" interrupted I. "Thornhill, was not that his name? it can certainly be no other than my landlord."—"Bless me," cried Mrs. Arnold, "is Mr. Thornhill so near a neigh∣bour of yours? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a visit from him shortly."</P>
<P>"My friend's first care," continued my son, "was to alter my appearance by a very fine suit of his own cloaths, and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half-friend, half-underling. My business was to attend him at auctions, to put him in spirits when he sat for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to assist at tatter∣ing a kip, as the phrase was, when we had a mind for a frolic. Besides this, I had twenty other little employ∣ments in the family. I was to do many small things without bidding; to carry the corkscrew; to stand god∣father to all the butler's children; to sing when I was bid; to be never out of humour; always to be humble, and, if I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be happy."</P>
<P>"In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nourable post, however, I was not with∣out
<PB N="100" REF="012405_0098_0F89734831B3FFC0"/>
a rival. A captain of marines, who seemed formed for the place by nature, opposed me in my patron's af∣fections. His mother had been laundress to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedigree. As this gentleman made it the study of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was dis∣missed from several for his stupidity; yet he found many of them who permitted his assiduities, being as dull as himself. As flattery was his trade, he practised it with the easiest address imaginable; but it came aukward and stiff from me; and as every day my patron's desire of flattery encreased, so every hour being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occasion for my asist∣ance. This was nothing less than to fight a duel for him, with a gentleman whose sister it was pretended he had used ill. I readily complied with his request, and tho' I see you are displeased at my conduct, yet as it was a debt indispensably due to friendship, I could not refuse. I undertook the affair disarmed my antagonist, and soon after had the pleasure of finding that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a sharper. This piece of service was repaid with the warmest professions of gratitude; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method to serve me, but by recommending me to his uncle Sir William Thornhill, and another nobleman of great dis∣tinction, who enjoyed a post under the government. When he was gone, my first care was to carry his recom∣mendatory letter to his uncle, a man whose character for every virtue was universal yet just. I was received by his servants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most hospitable smiles; for the looks of the domestics ever transmit their master's benevolence. Being shewn into a grand apartment, where Sir William soon came to me, I delivered my message and letter, which he read, and after pausing some minutes, Pray, Sir, cried he, inform me what you have done for my kinsman, to deserve this warm recommendation? But I suppose, Sir, I guess at your merits, you h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e fought for him; and so you would expect a reward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m me, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being the instrument of his vices. I wish, sincerely wish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="101" REF="012405_0099_0F89731F4089EC98"/>
that my present refusal may be some punishment for your guilt; but still more, that it may be some induce∣ment to your repentance.—The severity of this rebuke I bore patiently, because I knew it was just. My whole expectations now, therefore, lay in my letter to the great man. As the doors of the nobility are almost ever beset with beggars, all ready to thrust in some sly petition, I found it no easy matter to gain admittance. However, after bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune, I was at last shewn into a spacious apartment, my letter being previously sent up for his lordship's in∣spection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me. Every thing was grand, and of happy contrivance: the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raised my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to myself, how very great must the pos∣sessor of all these things be, who carries in his head the business of the state, and whose house displays half the wealth of a kingdom: sure his genius must be unfathom∣able! During these awful reflections I heard a step come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man himself; No, it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard soon after. This must be He! No, it was only the great man's valet de chambre. At last his lordship actually made his appearance. Are you, cried he, the bearer of this here letter? I answered with a bow. I learn by this" con∣tinued he, "as how that—But just at that instant a servant delivered him a card, and without taking farther notice, he went out of the room, and left me to digest my own happiness at leisure. I saw no more of him▪ till told by a footman that his lordship was going to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coach at the door. Down I immediately followed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> joined my voice to that of three or four more, who came, like me, to petition for favours. His lordship, however, went too fast for us, and was gaining his chariot door with large strides, when I hallooed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was by this time got in, and muttered an answer, half of which only I heard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he other half was lost in the rattling of his chariot wheels. I stood for some time with my neck stretched out, in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ure of one that was listening, to catch the glorious
<PB N="102" REF="012405_0100_0F89731FB34179A8"/>
sounds till looking round me, I found myself alone at his lordship's gate."</P>
<P>"My patience," continued my son, "was now quite exhausted: stung with the thousand indignities I had met with, I was willing to cast myself away, and only wanted the gulph to receive me. I regarded myself as one of those vile things that nature designed should be thrown by into her lumber room, there to perish in unpitied ob∣scurity. I had still however, half a guninea left, and of that I thought fortune herself should not deprive me: but in order to be sure of this I was resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it, and then trust to occurren∣ces for the rest. As I was going along with this resolu∣tion, it happened that Mr. Cripse's office seemed invit∣ingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this of∣fice Mr. Cripse kindly offers all his majesty's subjects a generous promise of 30 l. a year, for which promise all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permission to let him transport them to America as slaves. I was hap∣py at finding a place where I could lose my fears in des∣peration, and therefore entred this cell; for it had the appearance of one, being dark, damp, and dirty. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circumstances like myself, expecting the arival of Mr. Cripse, presenting a true epitome of English impatience. Each untractable soul at variance with fortune, wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked her injuries on their own hearts: but Mr. Cripse at last came down, and all our murmurs were hushed. He deigned to re∣gard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and in∣deed he was the first man who for a month past talked to me with smiles. After a few questions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He paused a while up∣on the properest means of providing for me, and slap∣ping his forehead, as if he had found it, assured me, that there was at that time an embassy talked of from the sy∣nod of Pennsylvania to the Chickasaw Indians, and that he would use his interest to get me made secretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promise gave me pleasure, there was something so mag∣nificent in the sound. I fairly, therefore, divide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny half guinea, one half of which went to be added to his thirty thousand pounds, and with the other half I re∣solved
<PB N="103" REF="012405_0101_0F89732071D80A50"/>
to go to the next tavern, to be there more happy than he.</P>
<P>"As I was going out with that resolution, I was met at the door by the captain of a ship, with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never chose to make a secret of my circumstances, he assured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in listening to the of∣fice-keeper's promises; for that he only designed to sell me to the plantations." "But," continued he, "I fancy you might, by a much shorter voyage, be very easily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my advi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. My ship sails to-morrow for Amsterdam; what if you go in her as a passenger? The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen English, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I suppose you un∣derstand English," added he, "by this time, or the duece is in it." I confidently assured him of that; but expressed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn English. He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to distraction; and upon that affirmati∣on I agreed with his proposal, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch English in Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage short, and after having paid my passage with half my moveables, I found myself, fallen as if from the skies, a stranger in one of the principal streets of Amsterdam. In this situation I was unwilling to let any time pass unemployed in teaching. I addres∣sed myself therefore to two or three of those I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, whose appearance seemed most promising; but it was impossi∣ble to make ourselves mutually understood. It was not till this very moment I recollected, that in order to teach Dutchmen English, it was necessary that they should first teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook so obvious an objection, is to me amazing; but certain it is I over∣looked it.</P>
<P>This scheme thus blown up, I had some thoughts of fairly shipping back to England again; but happening into company with an Irish student, who was returning from Louvain, our conversation turning upon topics of literature, (for by the way it may be observed, that I always forgot the meanness of my circumstances when I
<PB N="104" REF="012405_0102_0F89732133A36410"/>
could converse upon such subjects) from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole university who understood Greek. This amazed me. I instantly re∣solved to travel to Louvain, and there live by teaching Greek; and in this design I was heartened by my bro∣ther student, who threw out some hints that a fortune might be got by it.</P>
<P>I set boldly forward the next morning. Every day lessened the burthen of my moveables, like Aesop and his basket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was resolved not to go sneaking to the lower professors, but openly tendered my talents to the principal himself. I went, had admittance, and offered him my service as a master of the Greek language, which I had been told was a desideratum in his university. The <HI>principal</HI> seem∣ed at first to doubt of my abilities; but of these I offered to convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he should fix upon into Latin. Finding me perfectly ear∣nest in my proposal, he addressed me thus: "You see me, young man," continued he, I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I ever missed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek: I have ten thousand flo∣rins a year without Greek: and I eat heartily without Greek. In short," continued he, "I don't know Greek, and I do not believe there is any use in it."</P>
<P>I was now too far from home to think of returning: so I resolved to go forward. I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice, and now turned what was once my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sement into a present means of bare subsist∣ence. I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I ever found them sprightly in pro∣portion to their wants. Whenever I approached a pea∣sant's house towards night-fall, I played one of my most merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day. I once or twice at∣tempted to play for people of fashion; but they still thought my performance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extra∣ordinary, as whenever I used formerly to play for com∣pany, when playing was my amusement, my music never
<PB N="105" REF="012405_0103_0F897321F13A62F0"/>
failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies espe∣cially; but as it was now my only means, it was receiv∣ed with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to under-rate those talents which a man lives by.</P>
<P>In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no design but just to look about me, and then to go forward. The people of Paris are much fonder of strangers that have money, than of those that have wit. You may imagine then, as I could not boast much of either, that I was no great favourite. After I had walked about the town four or five days, and seen the outsides of the best houses, I was preparing to leave this retreat of venal hospitality, when passing through one of the principal streets, whom should I meet but our cousin, to whom you first recom∣mended me. This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not displeasing to him. He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his business there, which was to collect pictures, medals, in∣taglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had just stept into taste and a large for∣tune. I was still more surprised at seeing our cousin pitched upon for this office, as himself had often assured me he knew nothing of the matter. Upon my asking how he had been taught the art of a connoscento so very suddenly, he assured me that nothing was more easy. The whole secret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules: the one always to observe, that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains; and the other, to praise the works of Pietro▪ Perugino. But, says he, as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to instruct you in the art of picture buying at Paris.</P>
<P>With this proposal I very readily closed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went therefore to his lodgings, improved my dress by his as∣sistance, and after some time, accompanied him to auc∣tions of pictures▪ where the English gentry were expect∣ed to be purchasers. I was not a little surprised at his intimacy with people of the best fashion, who referred themselves to his judgment upon every picture or medal, as to an unerring standard of taste. He made very good use of my assistance upon these occasions; for when ask∣ed
<PB N="106" REF="012405_0104_0F897322B308E160"/>
his opinion, he would gravely take me aside, and ask mine, shrug, look wise, return, and assure the company, that he could give no opinion upon an affair of so much importance. Yet there was sometimes an occasion for a more supported assurance. I remember to have seen him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough, very deliberately take a brush with brown varnish, that was accidently lying in the place, and rub it over the piece with great composure before all the company, and then ask if he had not im∣proved the tints.</P>
<P>When he had finished his commission in Paris, he left me strongly recommended to several men of distinction, as a person very proper for a travelling tutor; and I was after some time employed in that capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to set him for∣ward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, with this injunction, that he should always be permitted to direct himself. My pu∣pil in fact understood the art of guiding in money con∣cerns much better than I. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds, left him by an un∣cle in the West-Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the management of it, had bound him appren∣tice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing passion: all his questions on the road were, how money might be saved; which was the least expensive course of travel; whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London. Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight was to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told it was not worth seeing. He never paid a bill, that he would not observe, how amazingly expensive travelling was, and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping, he enquired the expence of the passage by sea home to England. This he was in∣formed was but a trifle, compared to his returning by land, he was therefore unable to withstand the temptati∣on; so paying me the small part of my salary that was then due, he took leave, and embarked with only one attendant for London.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="012405_0105_0F897323748F8160"/>I now therefore was left once more upon the world at large, but then it was a thing I was used to. However my skill in music could avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musician than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which an∣swered my purpose as well, and this was a skill in dispu∣tation. In all the foreign universities and convents, there are upon certain days philosophical theses maintained a∣gainst every adventitious disputant; for which, if the champion opposes with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night. In this manner therefore I fought my way towards Eng∣land, walked along from city to city, examined man∣kind more nearly, and, if I may so express it, saw both sides of the picture. My remarks however, were few: I found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in, and common wealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every country ano∣ther name for freedom; and that no man is so fond of freedom himself that he would not chuse to subject the will of some individuals of societ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> own.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in England, I resolved to pay my respects first to you, and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was sent out; but on my jour∣ney down my resolutions were changed, by meeting an old acquaintance, who I found belonged to a company of comedians, that were going to make a summer cam∣paign in the country. The company seemed not much to disapprove of me for an associate. They all, howe∣ver, apprized me of the importance of the task at which I aimed; that the public was a many headed monster, and that only such as had very good heads could please it: that acting was not to be learned in a day; and that without some traditional shrugs, which had been on the stage, and only on the stage, these hundred years, I could never pretend to please. The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts, as almost every character was in keeping. I was driven, for some time, from one cha∣racter to another, till at last Horatio was fixed upon, which the presence of the present company happily hindered me from acting."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The short continuance of friendship amongst the vicious, which is coeval only with mutual satisfaction.</HEAD>
<P>MY son's account was too long to be delivered at once, the first part of it was begun that night, and he was concluding the rest after dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at the door seemed to make a pause in the ge∣neral satisfaction. The butler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a whisper, that the 'Squire had already made some overtures to Miss Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle seemed high∣ly to approve the match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's enter∣ing, he seemed, at seeing my son and me, to start back; but I readily imputed that to surprize, and not displea∣sure. However, upon our advancing to salute him, he returned our greeting with the most apparent candour; and after a short time, his presence seemed only to en∣crease the general good humour.</P>
<P>After tea he called me aside, to enquire after my daughter; but upon my informing him that my en∣quiry was unsuccessful, he seemed greatly surprised; adding, that he had been since frequently at my house, in order to comfort the rest of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then asked if I had communicated her misfortune to Miss Wilmot, or my son; and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, desiring me by all means to keep it a secret; "For at best," cried he,
<Q>it is but divulging one's own infamy; and perhaps Miss Livy may not be so guilty as we all imagine.</Q> We were here interrupted by a servant, who came to ask the 'Squire in, to stand up at country dances; so that he left me quite pleased with the interest he seemed to take in my concerns. His ad∣dresses,
<PB N="109" REF="012405_0107_0F8973255334EA78"/>
however, to Miss Wilmot, were too obvious to be mistaken; and yet she seemed not perfectly pleased, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt, than from real inclination. I had even the satis∣faction to see her lavish some kind looks upon my unfor∣tunate son, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor assiduity. Mr. Thornhill's seeming compo∣sure, however, not a little surprised me: we had now continued here a week, at the pressing instances of Mr. Arnold; but each day the more tenderness Miss Wilmot shewed my son, Mr. Thornhill's friendship seemed pro∣portionably to encrease for him.</P>
<P>He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his interest to serve the family; but now his generosity was not confined to promises alone: the morning I designed for my departure, Mr. Thorn∣hill came to me with looks of real pleasure to inform me of a piece of service he had done for his friend George. This was nothing less than his having pro∣cured him an ensign's commission in one of the regi∣ments that was going to the West-Indies, for which he had promised but one hundred pounds, his interest having been sufficient to get an abatement of the other two. "As for this trifling piece of service," continued the young gentleman,
<Q>I desire no other reward but the pleasure of having served my friend; and as for the hundred pound to be paid, if you are unable to raise it yourselves, I will advance it, and you shall repay me at your leisure.</Q> This was a favour we wanted words to express our sense of: I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and testified as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</P>
<P>George was to depart for town the next day to secure his commission, in pursuance of his generous pa∣tron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to use dispatch, lest in the mean time another should step in with more advantageous proposals. The next morn∣ing, therefore, our young soldier was early prepared for his departure, and seemed the only person among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and
<PB N="110" REF="012405_0108_0F897326D77589F8"/>
mistress, for Miss Wilmot actually loved him, he was leaving behind, any way damped his spirits. After he had taken leave, of the rest of the company, I gave him all I had, my blessing. "And now, my boy," cried I,
<Q>thou art going to fight for thy country, remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his sacred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and imitate him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lorld Falkland. Go, my boy, and if you fall, tho' distant, exposed and un∣wept by those that love you, the most precious tears are those with which heaven bedews the unburied head of a soldier.</Q></P>
<P>The next morning I took leave of the good fa∣mily, that had been kind enough to entertain me so long, not without several expressions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the enjoyment of all that happiness which affluence and good breeding procure, and returned towards home, despairing of ever finding my daughter more, but send∣ing a sigh to heaven to spare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired an horse to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted myself with the hopes of soon seeing all I held dearest upon earth. But the night coming on, I put up at a little public house by the road-side, and asked for the landlord's company over a pint of wine. We sat beside his kitchen fire, which was the best room in the house, and chatted on politics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill, whom the host assured me was hated as much as an uncle of his, who sometimes came down to the country, was loved. He went on to observe, that he made it his whole study to betray the daughters of such as received him to their houses, and after a fortnight or three weeks possession, he turned them out unregarded and abandoned to the world. As we con∣tinued our discourse in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, returned, and perceiving that her husband was enjoying a pleasure in which she was not a sharer, she asked him, in an angry tone, what
<PB N="111" REF="012405_0109_0F89732733F9A618"/>
he did there, to which he only replied in an ironical way by drinking her health. "Mr. Symmonds," cried she,
<Q>you use me very ill, and I'll bear it no longer. Here three parts of the business is left for me to do, and the fourth left unfinished; while you do nothing but soak with the guests all day long, where∣as if a spoonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop.</Q> I now found what she would be at, and immediately poured her out a glass, which she received with a curtesy, and drinking towards my good health, "Sir," resumed she,
<Q>it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry, but one can∣not help it, when the house is going out of the win∣dows. If the customers or guests are to be dunned, all the burthen lies upon my back, he'd as lief eat that glass as budge after them himself. There now above stairs, we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe she has got any money by her over civility. I am certain she is very slow of payment, and I wish she were put in mind of it.</Q> —
<Q>What signifies minding her,</Q>
cried the host, "if she be slow, she is sure." —"I don't know that," replied the wife;
<Q>but I know that I am sure she has been here a fortnight, and we have not yet seen the cross of her money.</Q> —"I suppose, my dear," cried he,
<Q>we shall have it all in a lump.</Q> —"In a lump!" cried the other,
<Q>I hope we may get it any way; and that I am resolved we shall this very night, or out she tramps, bag and baggage.</Q> —"Consider, my dear," cried the hus∣band,
<Q>she is a gentlewoman, and deserves more re∣spect.</Q> —"As for the matter of that," returned the host∣ess,
<Q>gentle or simple, out she shall p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck with a sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rara. Gentry may be good things where they take, but for my part I never saw much good of them at the sign of the Harrow.</Q> —Thus saying, she ran up a narrow flight of stairs, that went from the kitchen to a room over head, and I soon perceived by the loudness of her voice, and the bitterness of her re∣proaches, that no money was to be had from her lodger. I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly▪ "Out, I say, pack out this moment, tramp, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="112" REF="012405_0110_0F897327F1A3E2C0"/>
famous strumpet, or I'll give thee a mark thou won't be the better for this three months. What! you trumpery, to come and take up an honest house, without cross or coin to bless yourself with; come along, I say."—"O dear madam," cried the stranger, "pity me, a poor a∣bandoned creature for one night, and death will soon do the rest."—I instantly knew the voice of my poor ruin∣ed child Olivia. I flew to her rescue, while the woman was dragging her along by the hair, and caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms.—"Welcome, any way welcome, my dearest lost one, my treasure, to your poor old father's bosom. Tho' the vicious forsake thee, there is yet one in the world that will never forsake thee; tho' thou hadst ten thousand crimes to answer for, he will forget them all."—"O my own dear"—for minutes she could no more—"my own dearest good papa! Could angels be kinder! How do I deserve so much! The villain, I hate him and myself, to be a reproach to such goodness. You can't forgive me, I know you can∣not."—"Yes, my child, from my heart I do forgive thee! Only repent, and we both shall yet be happy. We shall see many pleasant days yet, my Olivia!"—"Ah! never, sir, never. The rest of my wretched life must be infamy abroad and shame at home. But, alas! papa, you look much paler than you used to do. Could such a thing as I am give you so much uneasiness? Sure you have too much wisdom to taste the miseries of my guilt upon yourself."—"Our wisdom, young woman," re∣plied I.—"Ah, why so cold a name, papa▪" cried she. "This is the first time you ever called me by so cold a name"—I ask pardon, my darling," returned I; "but I was going to observe, that wisdom makes but a slow defence against trouble, though at last a sure one."</P>
<P>The landlady now returned to know if we did not chuse a more genteel apartment, to which assenting, we were shewn a room, where we could converse more free∣ly. After we had talked ourselves into some degree of tranquillity, I could not avoid desiring some account of the gradations that led to her present wretched situation. "That villain, sir," said she, "from the first day of our meeting made me honourable, though private, propro∣sals."</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="012405_0111_0F897328B3268350"/>"Villain indeed," cried I; "and yet it in some mea∣sure surprises me, how a person of Mr. Burchell's good sense and seeming honour could be guilty of such delibe∣rate baseness, and thus step into a family to undo it."</P>
<P>"My dear papa," returned my daughter, "you la∣bour under a strange mistake, Mr. Burchell never at∣tempted to deceive me. Instead of that he took every opportunity of privately admonishing me against the ar∣tifices of Mr. Thornhill▪ who now I find was even worse than he represented him."—"Mr. Thornhill," inter∣rupted I, "can it be?"—"Yes, Sir," returned she, "it was Mr. Thornhill who seduced me, who employ∣ed the two ladies, as he called them, but who, in fact, were abandoned women of the town, without breeding or pity, to decoy us up to London. Their artifices, you may remember, would have certainly succeeded, but for Mr. Burchell's letter, who directed those reproaches at them, which we all applied to ourselves. How he came to have so much influence as to defeat their intenti∣ons, still remains a secret to me; but I am convinced he was ever our warmest, sincerest friend."</P>
<P>"You amaze me, my dear," cried I; "but now I find my first suspicions of Mr. Thornhill's baseness were too well grounded: but he can triumph in security; for he is rich and we are poor. But tell me, my child, sure it was no small temptation that could thus obliterate all the impressions of such an education, and so virtuous a disposition as thine."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," replied she, "he owes all his triumph to the desire I had of making him, and not myself, hap∣py. I knew that the ceremony of our marriage, which was privately performed by a popish priest, was no way binding, and that I had nothing to trust to but his ho∣nour." "What," interrupted I, "and were you in∣deed married by a priest, and in orders."—"Indeed. Sir, we were," replied she, "though we were both sworn to conceal his name."—"Why then, my child, come to my arms again, and now you are a thousand times more welcome than before: for you are now his wife to all intents and purposes: nor can all the laws of man, tho' written upon tables of adamant, lessen the force of that sacred connexion."</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="012405_0112_0F89732972D85798"/>"Alas, papa," replied she, "you are but little ac∣quainted with his villainies: he has been married alrea∣dy, by the same priest, to six or eight wives more, whom, like me, he has deceived and abandoned."</P>
<P>"Has he so?" cried I, "then we must hang the priest, and you shall inform against him to morrow."— "But, Sir," returned she, "will that be right, when I am sworn to secrecy?"—"My dear," I replied, "if you have made such a promise, I cannot, nor will not, tempt you to break it. Even tho' it may benefit the pub∣lic, you must not inform against him. In all human in∣stitutions a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good; as in politics, a province may be given away to se∣cure a kingdom; in medicine, a limb may be lopt off, to preserve the body. But in religion the law is written, and inflexible, <HI>never</HI> to do evil. And this law, my child, is right: for otherwise, if we commit a smaller evil, to procure a greater good, certain guilt would be thus in∣curred, in expectation of contingent advantage. And though the advantage should certainly follow, yet the in∣terval between commission and advantage, which is al∣lowed to be guilty, may be that in which we are called away to answer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions is closed for ever. But I inter∣rupt you, my dear, go on."</P>
<P>"The very next morning," continued she, "I found what little expectations I was to have from his sincerity. That very morning he introduced me to two unhappy women more, whom, like me, he had deceived, but who lived in contented prostitution. I loved him too tender∣ly to bear such rivals in his affections, and strove to for∣get my infamy in a tumult of pleasures. With this view, I danced, dressed, and talked; but still was unhappy. The gentlemen who visited there, told me every moment of the power of my charms, and this only contributed to encrease my melancholy, as I had thrown all their pow∣er quite away. Thus each day I grew more pensive, and he more insolent, till at last the monster had the assur∣ance to offer me to a young Baronet of his acquaintance. Need I describe, Sir, how his ingratitude stung me? My answer to this proposal was almost madness. I desired to part. As I was going he offered me a purse; but I flung
<PB N="115" REF="012405_0113_0F89732A3394A2B8"/>
it at him with indignation, and burst from him in a rage, that for a while kept me insensible of the miseries of my situation. But I soon looked round me, and saw myself a vile, abject, guilty thing, without one friend in the world to apply to.</P>
<P>"Just in that interval, a stage-coach happening to pass by, I took a place, it being my only aim to be driven at a distance from a wretch I despised and detested. I was set down here, where, since my arrival, my own anxiety, and this woman's unkindness, have been my on∣ly companions. The hours of pleasure that I have pass∣ed with my mamma and sister, now grow painful to me. Their sorrows are much; but mine are greater than theirs; for mine are guilt and infamy."</P>
<P>"Have patience, my child," cried I, "and I hope things will yet be better. Take some repose to-night, and to-morrow I'll carry you home to your mother, and the rest of the family, from whom you will receive a kind reception. Poor woman, this has gone to her heart: but she loves you still, Olivia, and will forget it."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Offences are easily pardoned where there is love at bottom.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning I took my daughter behind me, and set out on my return home. As we travelled along, I strove by every persuasion, to calm her sorrows and fears, and to arm her with resolu∣tion to bear the presence of her offended mother. I took every opportunity, from the prospect of a fine country, through which we passed to observe how much kinder Heaven was to us, than we were to each other, and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few. I assured her, that she should never per∣ceive any change in my affections, and that during my life, which yet might be long, she might depend upon a guardian and an instructor. I armed her against the censures of the world, shewed her, that books were sweet unreproaching companions to the miserable, and that if they could not bring us to en∣joy life, they would teach us to endure it.</P>
<P>The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my house, and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to come for her, acompanied by my daughter Sophia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed stage: however, after seeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the hostess to prepare proper refresh∣ments, I kissed her, and proceeded towards home. My heart caught new sensations of pleasure the nearer I approached that peaceful mansion. As a bird that has been frighted from its nest, my affections out-went my haste, and hovered round my little fire-side, with all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many
<PB N="117" REF="012405_0115_0F89732BB4E784A0"/>
fond things I had to say, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender em∣brace, and smiled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but slowly, the night waned apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to rest; the lights were out in every cottage; no sounds were heard but of the shrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow distance. I approached my little abode of pleasure, and before I was within a furlong of the place, our honest mastiff came running to welcome me.</P>
<P>It was now near mid-night that I came to knock at my door: all was still and silent: my heart dilated with unutterable happiness, when, to my amazement, the house was bursting out in a blaze of fire, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perture was red with conflagration! I gave a loud con∣vulsive outcry, and fell upon the pavement insensible. This alarmed my son, who perceiving the flames, in∣stantly waked my wife and daughter, and all running, out naked, and wild with apprehension, recalled me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife with their anguish. But it was only to objects of new terror; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family stood, with silent agony, look∣ing on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones; but they were not to be seen. O misery! "Where," cried I,
<Q>where are my little ones?</Q> —"They are burnt to death in the flames," says my wife calmly, "and I will die with them."— That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were just awaked by the fire, and nothing could have stopped me. "Where, where, are my children?" cried I, rushing through the flames, and bursting the door of the chamber in which they were confined, "Where are my little ones?"— <Q>Here, dear-papa, here we are,</Q> cried they together, while the flames were just catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms and snatched them through the fire as fast as possible, while just as I got out, the roof sunk in. "Now," cried I, holding up my children,
<Q>now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions
<PB N="118" REF="012405_0116_0F89732D406712B8"/>
perish. Here they are, I have saved my treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.</Q> We kissed our little darlings a thou∣sand times, they clasped us round the neck, and seemed to share our transports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns.</P>
<P>I now stood a calm spectator of the flames, and, af∣ter some time began to perceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible manner. It was therefore out of my power to give my son any assistance, either in attempting to save our goods, or preventing the flames spreading to our corn. By this time, the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our assistance; but all they could do was to stand, like us, spectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had reserved for my daughters for∣tunes, were entirely consumed, except a box, with some papers, that stood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little consequence, which my son brought away in the beginning. The neighbours contributed, however what they could to lighten our distress. They brought us cloaths, and furnished one of our out-houses with kitchen utensils; so that by day-light we had another, tho' a wretched dwelling to retire to. My honest next neighbour, and his chil∣dren were not the least assiduous in providing us with every thing necessary, and offering whatever consolati∣on untuto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed benevolence could suggest.</P>
<P>When the fears of my family had subsided, curiosity to know the cause of my long stay began to take place; having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one; and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, yet to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions. Be∣ing unable to go for my poor child myself, as my arm now grew very painful, I sent my son and daugh∣ter, who soon returned, supporting the wretched delin∣quent, who had not courage to look up at her mother, whom no instructions of mine could persuade to a per∣fect
<PB N="119" REF="012405_0117_0F89732E51AD5078"/>
reconciliation; for women have a much stronger sense of female error than men. "Ah, madam," cried her mother,
<Q>this is but a poor place you are come to after so much finery. My daughter Sophy and I can afford but little entertainment to persons who have kept company only with people of distinc∣tion. Yes, Miss Livy, your poor father and I have suffered very much of late; but I hope heaven will forgive you.</Q> —During this reception, the unhappy victim stood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to reply; but I could not continue a silent spectator of her distress: wherefore assuming a degree of severity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with instant submission,
<Q>I entreat, woman, that my words may be now marked once for all: I have here brought you back a poor deluded wan∣derer; her return to duty demands the revival of our tenderness. The real hardships of life are now coming fast upon us, let us not therefore encrease them by dissention among each other. If we live harmoniously together, we may yet be contented, as there are enough of us here to shut out the censur∣ing world, and keep each other in countenance. The kindness of heaven is promised to the penitent, and let ours be directed by the example. Heaven, we are assured, is much more pleased to view a repentant sinner, than many persons who have supported a course of undeviating rectitude. And this is right; for that single effort by which we stop short in the down-hill path to perdition, is itself a greater exertion of virtue, than an hundred acts of justice.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. None but the guilty can be long and completely miserable.</HEAD>
<P>SOME assiduity was now required to make our pre∣sent abode as convenient as possible, and we were soon again qualified to enjoy our former serenity. Being disabled myself from assisting my son in our usual occu∣pations, I read to my family from the few books that were saved, and particularly from such, as, by amusing the imagination, contributed to ease the heart. Our good neighbours too came every day with the kindest condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to assist at repairing my former dwelling. Honest farmer Williams was not last among these visitors; but hear∣tily offered his friendship. He would even have re∣newed his addresses to my daughter; but she rejected them in such a manner as totally repressed his future so∣licitations. Her grief seemed formed for continuing, and she was the only person of our little society that a week did not restore to chearfulness. She now lost that unblushing innocence which once taught her to respect herself, and to seek pleasure by pleasing. Anxiety now had taken strong possession of her mind, her beauty began to be impared with her constitution, and neglect still more contributed to diminish it. Every tender epi∣thet, bestowed on her sister brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice, tho' cured, al∣most ever plants others where it has been, so her former guilt, tho' driven out by repentance, left jealousy and envy behind. I strove a thousand ways to lessen he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="121" REF="012405_0119_0F89732F71D91BC0"/>
care, and even forgot my own pain in a concern for her's, collecting such amusing passages of history, as a strong memory and some reading could suggest.
<Q>Our happiness, my dear,</Q> I would say,
<Q>is in the power of one who can bring it about a thousand unforeseen ways, that mock our foresight. If example be ne∣cessary to prove this, I'll give you a story, my child, told us by a grave, tho' sometimes a romancing, historian.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the first quality, and found herself a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen. As she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a sudden spring leaped from her arms into the flood below, and disappeared in a moment. The mother, struck with instant sur∣prize, and making an effort to save him, plunged in after; but, far from being able to assist the infant, she herself with great difficulty escaped to the op∣posite shore, just when some French soldiers were plundering the country on that side, who immediate∣ly made her their prisoner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmost inhumanity, they were going at once to perpetrate those two extremes, suggested by appetite and cruelty. This base reso∣lution, however, was opposed by a young officer, who, tho' their retreat required the utmost expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in safety to his native city. Her beauty at first caught his eye, her merit soon after his heart. They were married; he rose to the highest posts; they lived long together, and were happy. But the selicity of a soldier can never be called permanent: after an interval of seve∣ral years the troops, which he commanded having met with a repulse, he was obliged to take shelter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they suffered a siege, and the city at length was taken. Few histories can produce more various instances of cruelty, than those which the French and Italians at
<PB N="122" REF="012405_0120_0F8973303335CD60"/>
that time exercised upon each other. It was resolved by the victors, upon this occasion, to put all the French prisoners to death; but particularly the husband of the unfortunate Matilda, as he was prin∣cipally instrumental in protracting the siege. Their determinations were, in general executed almost as soon as resolved upon. The captive soldier was led forth, and the executioner, with his sword, stood ready, while the spectators in gloomy silence awaited the fatal blow, which was only suspended till the ge∣neral, who presided as judge, should give the signal. It was in this interval of anguish and expectation, that Matilda came to take her last farewell of her husband and deliverer, deploring her wretched situation and the cruelty of fate, that had saved her from perishing by a premature death in the river Volturna, to be the spectator of still greater calamities. The general, who was a young man, was struck with surprize at her beauty, and pity at her distress; but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers. He was her son, the infant for whom she had encountred so much danger. He acknowledged her at once as his mother and fell at her feet. The rest may be easily supposed: the cap∣tive was set free, and all the happiness that love, friendship, and duty could confer on each, were united.</Q></P>
<P>In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daugh∣ter; but she listened with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engrossed all the pity she once had for those of another, and nothing gave her ease. In com∣pany she dreaded contempt: and in solitude she only found anxiety. Such was the colour of her wretched∣ness, when we received certain information, that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot, for whom I always suspected he had a real passion, tho' he took every opportunity before me to express his con∣tempt both of her person and fortune. This news only served to encrease poor Olivia's affliction; such a fla∣grant breach of fidelity, was more than her courage could
<PB N="123" REF="012405_0121_0F897330F2ED27B8"/>
support. I was resolved, however, to get more certain information, and to defeat, if possible, the completion of his designs, by sending my son to old Mr. Wilmot's, with instructions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Miss Wilmot a letter, intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family. My son went, in pursuance of my directions, and in three days returned, assuring us of the truth of the account; but that he had found it impossible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Miss Wilmot were visiting round the country. They were to be mar∣ried, he said, in a few days, having appeared together at church the Sunday before he was there, in great splendour, the bride attended by six young ladies dressed in white, and he by as many gentlemen. Their ap∣proaching nuptials filled the whole country with re∣joicing, and they usually rode out together in the grand∣est equipage that had been seen in the country for many years. All the friends of both families, he said, were there, particularly the 'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore so good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and feasting were going for∣ward; that all the country praised the young bride's beauty and the bridegroom's fine person, and that they were immensely fond of each other; concluding, that he could not help thinking Mr. Thornhill one of the most happy men in the world.</P>
<P>"Why let him if he can," returned I:
<Q>but, my son, observe this bed of straw, and unsheltering roof; those mouldering walls, and humid floor; my wretch∣ed body thus disabled by fire, and my children weeping round me for bread; you have come home, my child, to all this, yet here, even here you see a man that would not for a thousand worlds ex∣change situations. O, my children, if you could but learn to commune with your own hearts, and know what noble company you can make them, you would little regard the elegance and splendours of the worthless. Almost all men have been taught to call life a passage and themselves the travellers. The similitude still may be improved when we observe that
<PB N="124" REF="012405_0122_0F897331B3EA0618"/>
the good are joyful and serene, like travellers that are going towards home; the wicked but by inter∣vals happy, like travellers that are going into exile.</Q></P>
<P>My compassion for my poor daughter, overpowered by this new disaster▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pted what I had farther to observe. I bade her mother support her, and after a short time she recovered. She appeared from this time more calm, and I imagined had gained a new degree of resolution: but appearances deceived me: for her tran∣quillity was the languor of over wrought resentment. A supply of provisions, charitably sent us by my kind parishioners, seemed to diffuse chearfulness amongst the rest of the family, nor was I displeased at seeing them once more sprightly and at ease. It would have been unjust to damp their satisfactions, merely to condole with resolute melancholy, or to burthen them with a sadness they did not feel. Once more therefore, the tale went round and the song was demanded, and chear∣fulness condescended to hover round our little habi∣tation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V, Fresh calamities.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the season; so that we agree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> breakfast together at the honey-suckle bank: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, while we sate my youngest daughter, at my request, joined her voice to the concert on the trees about us. It was here my poor Olivia first met her seducer, and every object served to recall her sadness. But that melancholy, which is excited by objects of pleasure, or inspired by sounds of harmony, sooths the heart in∣stead of corroding it. Her mother too, upon this oc∣casion, felt a pleasing distress, and wept, and loved her daughter as before. "Do, my pretty Olivia," cried she,
<Q>let us have that little melancholy air your p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was so fond of, your sister Sophy has already obliged us. Do, child, it will please your old father.</Q> She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved me.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>WHEN lovely woman stoops to folly,</L>
<L>And finds too late that men betray,</L>
<L>What charm can sooth her melancholy,</L>
<L>What art can wash her guilt away?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The only art her guilt to cover,</L>
<L>To hide her shame from every eye,</L>
<L>To give repentance to her lover,</L>
<L>And wring his bosom—is to die.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="126" REF="012405_0124_0F8973333356DA50"/>As she was concluding the last stanza, to which an interruption in her voice from sorrow gave peculiar softness, the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at a distance alarmed us all, but particularly encreased the uneasiness of my eldest daughter, who, desirous of shun∣ning her betrayer, returned to the house with her sister. In a few minutes he was alighted from his cha∣riot, and making up to the place where I was still sit∣ting, enquired after my health with his usual air of fa∣miliarity." Sir, "replied I,
<Q>your present assurance only serves to aggravate the baseness of your character; and there was a time when I would have chastised your insolence, for presuming thus to appear before me. But now you are safe; for age has cooled my passions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d my calling restrains them.</Q></P>
<P>"I vow, my dear sir," returned he,
<Q>I am amazed at all this; nor can I understand what it means! I hope you don't think your daughter's late excursion with me had any thing criminal in it.</Q></P>
<P>"Go," cried I,
<Q>thou art a wretch, a poor pitiful wretch, and every way a liar; but your meanness secures you from my anger! Yet, sir, I am descended from a family that would not have borne this! And so, thou vile thing, to gratify a momentary passion, thou hast made one poor creature wretched for life, and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their portion.</Q></P>
<P>"If she or you," returned he, <Q>are resolved to be miserable, I cannot help it. But you may still be happy; and whatever opinion you may have formed of me, you shall ever find me ready to contribute to it. We can readily marry her to another, and what is more, she may keep her lover beside; for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true regard for her.</Q></P>
<P>I found all my passions awakened at this new de∣grading proposal; for though the mind may often be calm under great injuries, little villainy can at any time get within the soul, and sting it into rage.— <Q>Avoid my sight, thou reptile,</Q> cried I,
<Q>nor continue to in∣sult me with thy presence. Were my brave son at
<PB N="127" REF="012405_0125_0F897333F142E2B8"/>
home, he would not suffer this; but I am old, and disabled, and every way undone.</Q></P>
<P>"I find," cried he,
<Q>you are bent upon obliging me to talk in an harsher manner than I intended. But as I have shewn you what may be hoped from my friendship, it may not be improper to represent what may be the consquences of my resentment. My attorney, to whom your late bond has been trans∣ferred, threatens hard, nor do I know how to pre∣vent the course of justice, except by paying the mo∣ney myself, which, as I have been at some expences lately, previous to my intended marriage, it is not so easy to be done. And then my steward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he knows his duty; for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature. Yet still I could wish to serve you, and even to have you and your daughter present at my marriage, which is shortly to be solemnized with Miss Wilmot: it is even the request of my charming Arabella her∣self, whom I hope you will not refuse.</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Thornhill," replied I,
<Q>hear me once for all: as to your marriage with any but my daughter, that I never will consent to; or though your friendship could raise me to a throne, and your resentment sink me to the grave, yet would I despise both. Thou hast once wofully, irreparably deceived me. I re∣posed my heart upon thine honour, and have found it's baseness. Never more, therefore, expect friend∣ship from me. Go and possess what fortune has given thee, beauty, riches, health, and pleasure. Go, and leave me to want, infamy, disease, and sorrow. Yet humbled as I am, shall my heart still vindicate its dignity, and though thou hast my forgiveness, thou shalt ever have my contempt.</Q></P>
<P>"If so," returned he,
<Q>depend upon it you shall feel the effects of this insolence, and we shall shortly see which is the fittest object of scorn, you or I.</Q> — Upon which he departed abruptly.</P>
<P>My wife and son, who were present at this interview, seemed terrified with the apprehension. My daughters also finding that he was gone, came out to be informed
<PB N="128" REF="012405_0126_0F8973358459A1D8"/>
of the result of our conference, which, when known, alarmed them not less than the rest. But as to myself I disregarded the utmost stretch of his malevolence: he had already struck the blow, and now I stood pre∣pared to repel every new effort. Like one of those in∣struments used in the art of war, which, however, thrown, still presents a point to receive the enemy.</P>
<P>We soon, however found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very next day his steward came to de∣mand my annual rent, which, by the train of accidents already related, I was unable to pay. The consequence of my incapacity was his driving my cattle that evening, and their being appraised and sold the next day for less than half their value. My wife and children now there∣fore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain destruction. They even begged of me to admit his visits once more, and used all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure: the terrors of a prison, in so rigorous a season as the present, with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire. But I continued inflexible.</P>
<P>"Why, my treasures," cried I,
<Q>why will you thus attempt to persuade me to the thing that is not right! My duty has taught me to forgive him; but my conscience will not permit me to approve. Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart must internally condemn? Would you have me tamely sit down and flatter our infamous betrayer; and to avoid a prison continually suffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement! No, never. If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right, and wherever we are thrown, we can still retire to a charming apartment, and look round our own hearts with intrepidity and with pleasure!</Q></P>
<P>In this manner we spent that evening. Early the next morning, as the snow had fallen in great ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dance in the night, my son was employed in clearing it away, and opening a passage before the door. He had not been thus engaged long, when he came running in,
<PB N="129" REF="012405_0127_0F897336839148C8"/>
with looks all pale, to tell us that two strangers, whom he knew to be officers of justice, were making towards the house.</P>
<P>Just as he spoke, they came in, and approaching the bed where I lay, after previously informing me of their employment and business, made me their prisoner, bid∣ding me prepare to go with them to the county goal, which was eleven miles off.</P>
<P>"My friends," said I,
<Q>this is severe weather on which you have come to take me to a prison; and it is particularly unfortunate at this time, as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner, and it has thrown me into a slight fever, and I want cloaths to cover me, and I am now too weak and old to walk far in such deep snow: but if it must be so, I'll try to obey you.</Q></P>
<P>I then turned to my wife and children, and directed them to get together what few things were left us, and to prepare immediately for leaving this place. I en∣treated them to be expeditious and desired my son to assist his elder sister, who, from a consciousness that she was the cause of all our calamities, was fallen, and had lost anguish in insensibility. I encouraged my wife, who, pale and trembling, clasped our affrighted little ones in her arms, that clung to her bosom in silence, dreading to look round at the strangers. In the mean time my young¦est daughter prepared for our departure, and as she re¦ceived several hints to use dispatch, in about an hour we were ready to depart.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. No situation, however wretched it seems, but has some sort of comfort attending it.</HEAD>
<P>WE set forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on slowly. My eldest daughter being enfeebled by a slow fever, which had begun for some days to undermine her constitution, one of the officers, who had an horse, kindly took her behind him; for even these men cannot entirely divest themselves of hu∣manity. My son led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon my youngest girl, whose tears fell not for her own but my distresses.</P>
<P>We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles, when we saw a crowd running and shouting be∣hind us, consisting of about fifty of my poorest parishio∣ners. These, with dreadful imprecations soon seized upon the two officers of justice, and swearing they would never see their minister go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to shed in his defence, were going to use them with great severity. The consequence might have been fatal, had I not immediately inter∣posed, and with some difficulty rescued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My children who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared trans∣ported with joy, and were incapable of containing their raptures. But they were soon undeceived, upon hear∣ing me address the poor deluded people, who came, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they imagined, to do me service.</P>
<P>"What! my friends, cried I,
<Q>and is this th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way you love me! Is this the manner you obey the
<PB N="131" REF="012405_0129_0F897337B1BAB298"/>
instructions I have given you from the pulpit! Thus to fly in the face of justice, and bring down ruin on yourselves and me! Which is your ringleader? Shew me the man that has thus seduced you. As sure as he lives he shall feel my resentment. Alas! my dear deluded flock, return back to the duty you owe to God, to your country and to me. I shall yet per∣haps one day see you in greater felicity here, and contribute to make your lives more happy. But let it at least be my comfort when I pen my fold for im∣mortality, that not one here shall be wanting.</Q></P>
<P>They now seemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I shook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving them my blessing, proceeded forward without meeting any farther interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather village; for it consisted but of a few mean houses, having lost all its former opulence, and re∣taining no marks of its ancient superiority but the gaol.</P>
<P>Upon entering, we put up at an inn, where we had such refreshments as could most readily be procured, and I supped with my family with my usual chearfulness. After seeing them properly accomodated for that night, I next attended the sheriff's officers to the prison, which had formerly been built for the purposes of war, and consisted of one large apartment, strongly grated, and paved with stone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty. Besides this, every prisoner had a separate cell, where he was locked in for the night.</P>
<P>I expected upon my enterance to find nothing but lamentations, and various sounds of misery; but it was very different. The prisoners seemed all employed in one common design, that of forgetting thought in mer∣riment or clamour. I was apprized of the usual per∣quisite required upon these occasions, and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhausted. This was immedi∣ately sent away for liquor, and the whole prison soon was filled with riot, laughter, and prophaneness.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="012405_0130_0F89733874497F80"/>"How," cried I to myself,
<Q>shall men so very wicked be chearful, and shall I be melancholy! I feel only the same confinement with them, and I think I have more reason to be happy.</Q></P>
<P>With such reflections I laboured to become chearful; but chearfulness was never yet produced by effort, which is itself painful. As I was sitting therefore in a corner of the gaol, in a pensive posture, one of my fellow prisoners came up, and sitting by me, entered into conversation. It was my constant rule in life never to avoid the conversation of any man who seemed to desire it: for if good, I might profit by his instruction: if bad, he might be assisted by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of strong unlettered sense; but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more properly speaking, of human nature on the wrong side. He asked me if I had taken care to provide my∣self with a bed, which was a circumstance I had never once attended to.</P>
<P>"That's unfortunate," cried he,

<P>I thanked him, professing my surprize at finding such humanity in a gaol in misfortunes; adding, to let him see that I was a scholar,
<Q>That the sage ancient seemed to understand the value of company in affliction when he said, Ton kosmon aire, ei dos ton etairon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in fact,</Q> continued I,

so much learning; but I think I have heard all this before. Have I not had the pleasure of once see∣ing you at Welbridge fair, and is not your name Ephra∣im Jenkinson?" At this demand he only sighed. "I suppose you must recollect," resumed I, "one Doctor Primrose, from whom you bought a horse."</P>
<P>He now at once recollected me; for the gloominess of the place and the approaching night had prevented his distinguishing my features before.—"Yes, Sir," returned Mr. Jenkinson, "I remember you perfectly well, I bought an horse, but forgot to pay for him. Your neighbour Flamborough is the only prose∣cutor I am any way afraid of at the next assizes: for he intends to swear positively against me as a coiner. I am heartily sorry, Sir, I ever deceived you, or indeed any man: for you see," continued, he, shewing his shackles, "what my tricks have brought me to."</P>
<P>"Well, sir," replied I, "your kindness in offering me assistance, when you could expect no return, shall be repaid with my endeavours to soften or totally sup∣press Mr. Flamborough's evidence, and I will send my son to him for that purpose the first opportunity; nor do I in the least doubt but he will comply with my re∣quest, and as to my own evidence, you need be under no uneasiness about that."</P>
<P>"Well, sir," cried he, "all the return I can make shall be yours. You shall have more than half my bed∣cloaths to night, and I'll take care to stand your friend in the prison, where I think I have some influence."</P>
<P>I thanked him, and could not avoid being surprised at the present youthful change in his aspect, for at the time I had seen him before, he appeared at least sixty. —'Sir," answered he, "you are little acquainted with the world; I had at that time false hair, and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from seven∣teen to seventy. Ah sir, had I but bestowed half the pains in learning a trade, that I have in learning to be a scoundrel, I might have been a rich man at this day. But rogue as I am, still I may be your friend, and that perhaps when you least expect it."</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="012405_0132_0F897339F35F1B98"/>We were now prevented from further conversa∣tion, by the arrival of the gaoler's servants, who came to call over the prisoners names, and lock up for the night. A fellow also, with a bundle of straw for my bed atten∣ded, who led me along a dark narrow passage into a room paved like the common prison, and in one corner of this I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead my bed, and the cloaths given me by my fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prisoner; which done, my conducter who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh, bade me a good night.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A reformation in the gaol. To make laws complete they should reward as well as punish.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears at my bed-side. The gloomy-strength of every thing about us, it seems, had daunted them. I gently rebuked their sorrow, assuring them I had never slept with greater tranquillity, and next enquired after my eldest daughter, who was not among them. They informed me that yesterday's uneasiness and fatigue had encreased her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her behind. My next care was to send my son to procure a room or two to lodge the family in, as near the prison as conveniently could be found. He obeyed; but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a small expence, for his mother and sisters, the gaoler with humanity consenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the prison with me. A bed was therefore prepared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought answered very conveniently. I was willing however previously to know whether my little children chose to lie in a place which seemed to fright them upon entrance.</P>
<P>"Well," cried I, "my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</P>
<P>"No, papa" says Dick, "I am not afraid to lie any where, where you are."</P>
<P>"And I," says Bill, who was yet but four years old, "love every place best that my papa is in."</P>
<P>After this, I allotted to each of the family what they were to do. My daughter was particularly directed to watch her declining sister's health; my wife was to at∣tend
<PB N="136" REF="012405_0134_0F89733C48D7BBA0"/>
me; my little boys were to read to me: "And as for you, my son," continued I, "it is by the labour of your hands we must all hope to be supported. Your wages, as a day labourer, will be full sufficient, with proper frugality, to maintain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now sixteen years old, and hast strength, and it was given to thee, my son, for very useful purposes; for it must save from famine your helpless parents and family. Prepare then this evening to look out for work against to-morrow, and bring home every night what money you earn, for our support."</P>
<P>Having thus instructed him, and settled the rest, I walked down to the common prison, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdness, and brutality that in∣vaded me on every side, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I sat for some time, pondering upon the strange infatuation of wretches, who finding all man∣kind in open arms against them, were, however labour∣ing to make themselves a future and a tremendous ene∣my.</P>
<P>Their insensibility excited my highest compassion, and blotted my own uneasiness a while from my mind. It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I resolved therefore once more to re∣turn, and in spite of their contempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by perseverance. Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jen∣kinson of my design, at which he laughed, but com∣municated it to the rest. The proposal was received with the greatest good humour, as it promised to afford a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for mirth, but what could be de∣rived from ridicule or debauchery.</P>
<P>I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience per∣fectly merry upon the occasion. Lewd whispers▪ groans of contrition burlesqued, winking and cough∣ing, alternately excited laughter. However, I con∣tinued with my natural solemnity to read on, sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ble that what I did might amend some, but could it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive no contamination from any.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="012405_0135_0F89733CF1D86BF8"/>After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather calculated at first to amuse them than to re∣prove. I previously observed, that no other motive but their welfare could induce me to this; that I was their fellow prisoner, and now gained nothing by preach∣ing. I was sorry, I said, to hear them so very prophane; because they got nothing by it, but might lose a great deal: "For be assured, my friends," cried I, for you are my friends, however the world may disclaim your friendship, though you swore twelve thousand oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your purse. Then what signifies calling every moment upon the devil, and courting his friendship, since you find how scurvily he uses you? He has given you nothing here, you find, but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and by the best accounts I have of him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.</P>
<P>"If used ill in our dealings with one man, we natur∣ally go elsewhere. Were it not worth your while then, just to try how you may like the usage of another master, who gives you fair promises at least to come to him? Surely, my friends, of all stupidity in the world, his must be greatest, who after robbing an house, runs to the thief-takers for protection. And yet how are you more wise? You are all seeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you, applying to a more malicious being than any thief-taker of them all; for they only decoy, and then hang you but he decoys, and hangs, and, what is worst of all, will not let you loose after the hangman has done."</P>
<P>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, some of whom came and shook me by the hand, swearing that I was a very honest fellow, and that they desired my further acquaintance. I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually con∣ceived some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus satisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where my wife had prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to
<PB N="138" REF="012405_0136_0F89733DB35ED160"/>
ours, and partake of the pleasure, as he was kind enough to express it, of my conversation. He had not yet seen my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow passage, already described, by this means they avoided the common prison. Jenkinson at the first interview therefore seemed not a little struck with the beauty of my youngest daughter, which her pensive air contributed to heighten, and my little ones did not pass unnoticed.</P>
<P>"Alas, Doctor," cried he, "these children are too handsome and too good for such a place as this!"</P>
<P>"Why, Mr. Jenkinson," replied I, "thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals, and if they be good, it matters little for the rest."</P>
<P>"I fancy, sir, returned my fellow prisoner, "that it must give you great comfort to have this little family a∣bout you."</P>
<P>A comfort, Mr. Jenkinson," replied I, "yes it is in∣deed a comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world; for they can make a dungeon seem a palace. There is but one way in this life of wounding my happiness, and that is by injuring them."</P>
<P>"I am afraid then, sir," cried he, "that I am in some measure culpable; for I think I see here (looking at my son Moses) "one that I have injured, and by whom I wish to be forgiven."</P>
<P>My son immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had before seen him in disguise taking him by the hand, with a smile forgave him. "Yet," continued he, "I can't help wondering at what you could see in my face, to think me a proper mark for deception."</P>
<P>"My dear sir, returned the other, "it was not your face, but your white stockings and the black ribband in your hair that allured me But no disparagement to your parts, I have deceived wiser men than you in my time, and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many for me at last."</P>
<P>"I suppose," cried my son, "that the narrative of such a life as yours must be extremely instructive and amusing."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="012405_0137_0F89733E71AFAA60"/>"Not much of either," returned Mr. Jenkinson. "Those relations which describe the tricks and vices only of mankind, by encreasing our suspicion in life, re∣tard our success. The traveller that distrusts every per∣son he meets, and turns back upon the appearance of e∣very man that looks like a robber, seldom arrives in time to his journey's end.</P>
<P>"Indeed I think from my own experience I may say, that the knowing one is the silliest fellow under the sun. I was thought cunning from my very childhood: when but seven years old the ladies would say that I was a perfect little man; at fourteen I knew the world, cocked my hat, and loved the ladies; at twenty, though I was perfectly honest, yet every one thought me so cunning, that not one would trust me. Thus I was at last obliged to turn sharper in my own defence, and have lived ever since, my head throbbing with schemes to deceive, and my heart palpitating with fears of detection.</P>
<P>"I used often to laugh at your honest simple neigh∣bour Flamborough, and one way or another generally cheated him once a year. Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion, and grew rich, while I still continued tricksy and cunning, and was poor, without the consolation of being honest.</P>
<P>"However," continued he, "let me know your case▪ and what has brought you here; perhaps though I have not skill to avoid a goal myself, I may extricate my friends."</P>
<P>In compliance with his curiosity, I informed him of the whole train of accidents and follies that had plunged me into my present troubles, and my utter inability to get free.</P>
<P>After hearing my story, and pausing some minutes, he slapt his forehead, as if he had hit upon something mate∣rial, and took his leave, saying he would try what could be done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The same Subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the scheme I had planned of reforming the prisoners, which they received with universal disap∣probation, alledging the impossibility and impropriety of it; adding, that my endeavours would no way contri∣bute to their amendment, but might probably disgrace my calling.</P>
<P>"Excuse me," returned I,
<Q>these people, however fallen, are still men, and that is a very good title to my affections. Good council rejected, returns to en∣rich the giver's bosom; and though the instruction I communicate may not mend them, yet it will assured∣ly mend myself. If these wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thousands ready to of∣fer their ministry; but, in my opinion, the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that seated up∣on a throne. Yes, my treasures, if I can mend them I will; perhaps they will not all despise me. Per∣haps I may catch up even one from the gulph, and that will be great gain; for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the human soul?</Q></P>
<P>Thus saying, I left them, and descended to the com∣mon prison, where I found the prisoners very merry, expecting my arrival: and each prepared with some goal trick to play upon the doctor. Thus, as I was going to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by ac∣cident, and then asked my pardon. A second, who stood at some distance, had a knack of spitting through his teeth, which fell in showers upon my book. A
<PB N="141" REF="012405_0139_0F89733FF2CDC490"/>
third would cry amen in such an affected tone, as gave the rest great delight. A fourth hath slily picked my pocket of my spectacles. But there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whose trick gave more universal pleasure than all the rest; for observing the manner in which I had disposed my books on the table before me, he very dexterously dis∣placed one of them, and put an obscene jest-book of his own in the place. However I took no notice of all that this mischievous groupe of little beings could do; but went on, perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt, would excite mirth only the first or se∣cond time, while what was serious would be permanent. My design succeeded, and in less than six days some were penitent, and all attentive.</P>
<P>It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address, at thus giving sensibility to wretches divested of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal services also, by rendering their situation somewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and excess, tumultuous riot and bitter repining. Their only employment was quarrelling among each other, playing cribbage, and cutting tobacco stoppers. From this last mode of idle industry I took the hint of setting such as chose to work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers, the pro∣per wood being bought by a general subscription, and when manufactured, sold by my appointment; so that each earned something every day: a trifle indeed, but sufficient to maintain him.</P>
<P>I did not stop here, but instituted fines for the punish∣ment of immorality, and rewards for peculiar industry. Thus in less than a fortnight I had formed them into something social and humane, and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator, who had brought men from their native ferocity into friendship and obedi∣ence.</P>
<P>And it were highly to be wished, that legislative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than severity. That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punish∣ments familiar, but formidable. Instead of our present,
<PB N="142" REF="012405_0140_0F897340B37274B8"/>
prisons, which find or make men guilty, which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thousands; it were to be wished we had as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if inno∣cent. And this, but not the increasing punishments, is the way to mend a state: nor can I avoid even ques∣tioning the validity of that right which social combi∣nations have assumed of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature. In cases of murder their right is obvi∣ous, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of self-de∣fence, to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another. Against such, all nature rises in arms; but it is not so against him who steals my pro∣perty. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine. If then I have any right, it must be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his horse, shall die. But this is a false compact; be∣cause no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And next the compact is inadequate, and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, since it is far better that two men should live, than that one man should ride.— But a compact that is false between two men, is equally so between an hundred, or an hundred thousand; for as ten millions of circles can never make a square, so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest founda∣tion to falsehood. It is thus that reason speaks, and un∣tutored nature says the same thing. Savages that are di∣rected nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they seldom shed blood but to reta∣liate former cruelty.</P>
<P>Our Saxon ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing governments that have the print of na∣ture still strong upon them, scarce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="012405_0141_0F8973417358F560"/>It is among the citizens of a refined community that pe∣nal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age; and as if our possessions were become dearer in proportion as they en∣creased, as if the more enormous our wealth, the more extensive our fears, our possessions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader.</P>
<P>Whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiousness of our people, that this country should shew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Perhaps it is owing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indiscriminate penal laws a nation beholds the same punishment affixed to dissimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no distinc∣tion in the penalty, the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime, and this distinction is the bul∣wark of all morality: thus the multitude of laws pro∣duce new vices, and new vices call for fresh restraints.</P>
<P>It were to be wished then that power, instead of con∣triving new laws to punish vice, instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a convulsion come to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches as useless, before we have tried their utility, instead of converting correction into vengeance, it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of government, and made law the protec∣tor, but not the tyrant of the people. We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we should then find that wretches, now stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury should feel a momentary pang, might if properly treated, serve to sinew the stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in times of danger, that, as their faces are like ours, thier hearts are so too; that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend; that a man may see his last crime without dying for it; and that very little blood will serve to cement our secu∣rity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Happiness and misery rather the result of prudence than of virtue in this life. Temporal evils or felicities are regarded by heaven as things merely in themselves trifling and unworthy its care in the distribution.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD now been confined more than a fornight, but had not since my arrival been visited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to see her. Having com∣municated my wishes to my wife, the next morning the poor girl entered my apartment, leaning on her sister's arm. The change which I saw in her countenance struck me. The numberless graces that once resided there were now fled, and the hand of death seemed to have moulded every feature to alarm me. Her temples were sunk, her forehead was tense, and a fatal paleness sat up∣on her cheek.</P>
<P>"I am glad to see thee, my dear," cried I; "but why this dejection, Livy? I hope my love, you have too great a regard for me, to permit disappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own. Be chearful, child, and we may yet see happier days."</P>
<P>"You have ever, sir," replied she, "been kind to me, and it adds to my pain that I shall never have an oppor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unity of sharing that happiness you promise. Happiness, I fear, is no longer reserved for me here; and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found distress. Indeed, Sir, I wish you would make a proper submission to Mr. Thornhill; it may, in some measure, induce him to pity you, and it will give me relief in dying."</P>
<P>"Never, child," replied I, "I never shall be brought to acknowledge my daughter a prostitute; for tho' the world may look upon your offence with scorn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt. My dear, I am no way miserable in this place, however dismal it may seem and be assured that while
<PB N="145" REF="012405_0143_0F897342F1CAC7C8"/>
you continue to bless m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y living, he shall never have my consent to make you more wretched by marrying another.</P>
<P>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow pri∣soner, who was by at this interview, sensibly enough ex∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ulated upon my obstinacy, in refusing a submission, which promised to give me freedom. He observed, that the rest of my family was not to be sacrificed to the peace of one child alone, and she the only one who had offended me. "Beside," added he, "I don't know if it be just thus to obstruct the union of man and wife, which you do at present, by refusing to consent to a match which you cannot hinder, but may render un∣happy."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied I, "you are unacquainted with the man that oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses us. I am very sensible that no submission I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour. I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than last year, died for want. But though my submission and approbation could trans∣fer me from hence, to the most beautiful apartment he is possessed of, yet I would grant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; as something whispers me that it would be giving a sanction to adul∣tery. While my daughter lives, no other marriage of of his shall ever be legal in my eye. Were she removed, indeed, I should be the basest of men, from any resent∣ment of my own, to attempt putting asunder those who wish for an union. No, villain as he is, I could then wish him married, to prevent the consequences of his future debaucheries. But should I not now be the most cruel of all fathers, to sign an instrument which must send my child to the grave, merely to avoid a prison myself; and thus to escape one pang, break my child's heart with a thousand?</P>
<P>He acquiesced in the justice of this answer, but could not avoid observing, that he feared my daughter's life was already too much wasted to keep me long a prisoner. "However, continued he, though you refuse to submit to the nephew, I hope you have no objections to lay∣ing your case before the uncle, who has the first cha∣racter in the kingdom for every thing that is just and good. I would advise you to send him a letter by the
<PB N="146" REF="012405_0144_0F897343B415D108"/>
post intimating all his nephew's ill usage, and my life for it that in three days you shall have an answer." I thank'd him for the hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and instantly set about com∣plying; but I wanted paper, and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provisions, however he supplied me.</P>
<P>For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety, to know what reception my letter might meet with; but in the mean time was frequently solicited by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's health. The third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no answer to my letter: the com∣plaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew, were no way likely to succeed; so that these hopes soon va∣nished like all my former. My mind, however, still sup∣ported itself though confinement and bad air began to make a visible alteration in my health, and my arm that had suffered in the fire, grew worse. But my children still sat by me, and while I was stretched on my straw, read to me by turns, or listned and wept at my insruc∣tions. But my daughter's health declined faster than mine; every message from her contributed to encrease my apprehensions and pain. The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was sent to Sir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that she was speechless. Now it was that confinement was truly painful to me: my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pillow of my child, to comfort, to strengthen her, to receive her last wishes, and teach her soul the way to heaven! Another account came. She was ex∣piring, and yet I was debarred the small comfort of weeping by her. My fellow prisoner, some time after, came with the last account. He bade me be patient. She was dead!—The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little ones, now my only compa∣nions, who were using all their innocent efforts to com∣fort me. They entreated to read to me, and bid me not to cry, for I was now too old to weep. "And is not my sister an angel, now, papa," cried the eldest, "and why then are you sorry for her? I wish I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my papa were with me." Yes," added my youngest darling, "Heaven where my sister
<PB N="147" REF="012405_0145_0F8973449889D470"/>
is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good people there, and the people here are very bad."</P>
<P>Mr. Jenkinson interrupted their harmless prattle, by observing that now my daughter was no more I should seriously think of the rest of my family, and at∣tempt to save my own life, which was every day declin∣ing for want of necessaries and wholsome air. He added, that it was now incumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own, to the welfare of those who depended on me for support; and that I was now, both by reason and justice, obliged to try to reconcile my landlord.</P>
<P>"Heaven be praised," replied I, "there is no pride left me now, I should detest my own heart if I saw either pride, or resentment lurking there. On the contrary, as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal. No, sir, I have no resentment now, and though he has taken from me what I held dearer than all his treasures, though he has wrung my heart, for I am sick almost to fainting, very sick, my fellow prisoner, yet that shall never inspire me with vengeance. I am now willing to approve his marriage, and if this submission can do him any pleasure, let him know, that if I have done him any injury, I am sorry for it." Mr. Jenkinson took pen and ink, and wrote down my submission nearly as I have exprest it, to which I signed my name. My son was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his seat in the country. He went, and in about six hours returned with a verbal answer. He had some difficulty, he said, to get a sight of his landlord, as the servants were insolent and sus∣picious; but he accidently saw him as he was going out upon business, preparing for his marriage, which was to be in three days. He continued to inform us, that he stept up in the humblest manner, and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he said that all submission was now too late and unnecessary; that he had heard of our application to his uncle, which met with the contempt it deserved; and as for the rest, that all future applications should be directed to his attorney, not to him. He observed, however, that as he
<PB N="148" REF="012405_0146_0F89734620E96A40"/>
had a very good opinion of the discretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the most agreeable intercessors.</P>
<P>"Well, sir," said I to my fellow prisoner, "you now discover the temper of the man that oppresses me. He can at once be facetious and cruel; but let him use me as he will, I shall soon be free, in spite of all his bolts to restrain me. I am now drawing to∣wards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it: this expectation cheers my afflictions; and though I shall leave an helpless family of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly forsaken; some friend, perhaps, will be found to assist them for the sake of their poor father, and some may charitably relieve them for the sake of their heavenly father."</P>
<P>Just as I spoke, my wife, whom I had not seen that day before, appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to speak. "Why, my love," cried I, "why will you thus encrease my affliction by your own; what though no submissions can turn our severe master, though he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedness, and though we have lost a darling child, yet still you will find comfort in your other children when I shall be no more." "We have indeed lost," returned she, "a darling child. My Sophia, my dearest, is gone, snatched from us, carried off by ruffians."</P>
<P>"How, madam," cried my fellow prisoner, " Miss Sophia carried off by villains, sure it cannot be?"</P>
<P>She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears. But one of the prisoners wives, who was present, and came in with her, gave us a more distinct account: she informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and her∣self, were taking a walk together on the great road a lit∣tle way out of the village, a post-chaise and four drove up to them and instantly stopt. Upon which, a well-drest man, but not Mr. Thornhill, stepping out, clasped my daughter round the waist, and forcing her in, bid the postillion drive on, so that they were out of sight in a moment.</P>
<P>"Now," cried I, "the sum of my miseries is made up, nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to
<PB N="149" REF="012405_0147_0F89734709556398"/>
give me another pang. What! not one left! not to leave me one! the monster! the child that was next my heart! she had the beauty of an angel, and almost the wisdom of an angel. But support that woman, nor let her fall. Not to leave me one!"—"Alas! my hushand," said my wife, "you seem to want comfort even more than I. Our distresses are great; but I could bear this and more, if I saw you but easy. They may take away my children and all the world, if they leave me but you."</P>
<P>My son, who was present, endeavoured to moderate our grief; he bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful—"My child," cried I, "look round the world, and see if there be any happiness left me now. Is not every ray of comfort shut out; while all our bright prospects only lie be∣yond the grave!"—"My dear father," returned he, "I hope there is still something that will give you an interval of satisfaction; for I have a letter from my brother George,"—"What of him, child," interrupted I, does he know of our misery. I hope my boy is exempt from any part of what his wretched family suffers?"— Yes, sir," returned he, "he is perfectly gay, chear∣ful, and happy. His letter brings nothing but good news; he is the favourite of his colonel, who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes vacant!"</P>
<P>"And are you sure of all this," cried my wife, "are you sure that nothing ill has befallen my boy?"— Nothing indeed, madam," returned my son, "you shall see the letter, which will give you the highest pleasure; and if any thing can procure you comfort I am sure that will." "But are you sure," still re∣peated she, "that the letter is from himself, and that he is really so happy?"—"Yes, madam," replied he, it is certainly his, and he will one day be the credit and the support of our family!"—"Then I thank providence," cried she, "that my last letter to him has miscarried. Yes, my dear," continued she, turn∣ing to me, "I will now confess that though the hand of heaven is sore upon us in other instances, it has been favourable here. By the last letter I wrote my son,
<PB N="150" REF="012405_0148_0F8973477480B450"/>
which was in the bitterness of anger, I desired him, upon his mother's blessing, and if he had the heart of a man, to see justice done his father and sister, and avenge our cause. But thanks be to him that directs all things, it has miscarried and I am at rest."— "Woman," cried I, "thou hast done very ill, and at another time my reproaches might have been more severe. Oh! what a tremendous gulph hast thou escaped, that would have buried both thee and him in endless ruin. Providence, indeed, has here been kinder to us than we to ourselves. It has reserved that son to be the father and protector of my children when I shall be away. How unjustly did I complain of being stript of every comfort, when I still hear that he is happy and insensible of our afflictions; still kept in reserve to support his widowed mother, to protect his brothers and sisters. But what sisters has he left, he has no sisters now, they are all gone, robbed from me, and I am undone."— "Father," interrupted my son, "I beg you will give me leave to read his letter, I know it will please you." Upon which, with my permission, he read as follows:</P>

<P>I Have called off my imagination a few moments from the pleasures that surround me, to fix it upon objects that are still more pleasing, the dear little fire-side at home. My fancy draws that harmless groupe as listening to every line of this with great composure. I view those faces with delight which never felt the deforming hand of ambition or distress! But whatever your happiness may be at home, I am sure it will be some addition to it▪ to hear that I am perfectly pleased with my situation, and every way happy here.</P>
<P>Our regiment is countermanded and is not to leave the kingdom; the colonel, who professes himself my friend, takes me with him to all companies where he is acquaint∣ed, and after my first visit, I generally find myself re∣ceived with increased respect upon repeating it.

by most of my absent friends, and in this number, I fear, Sir, that I must consider you; for I have long expected the pleasure of a letter from home to no pur∣pose. Olivia and Sophia too, promised to write, but seem to have forgotten me. Tell them then they are two arrant little baggages, and that I am this moment in a most violent passion with them: yet still, I know not how, tho' I want to bluster a little, my heart is re∣spondent only to softer emotions. Then tell them, sir, that after all, I love them affectionately, and be assured of my ever remaining</P>

<P>"In all our miseries," cried I, "what thanks have we not to return, that one at least of our family is exempt∣ed from what we suffer. Heaven be his guard, and keep my boy thus happy to be the supporter of his wi∣dowed mother, and the father of these two babes, which are all the patrimony I can now bequeath him. May he keep their innocence from the temptations of want, and be their conductor in the paths of honour." I had scarce said these words, when a noise, like that of a tu∣mult, seemed to proceed from the prison below; it died away soon after, and a clanking of setters was heard along the passage that led to my apartment. The keeper of the prison entered, holding a man all bloody, wounded and fettered with the heaviest irons. I looked with compassion on the wretch as he approached me, but with horror when I found it was my own son.— "My George! My George! and do I behold thee thus? Wounded! Fettered! Is this thy happiness! Is this the manner you return to me! O that this sight could break my heart at once and let me die!"</P>
<P>"Where, Sir, is your fortitude," returned my son with an intrepid voice. "I must suffer, my life is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣feited, and let them take it; it is my last happiness that I have committed no murder, tho' I have lost all hopes of pardon."</P>
<P>I tried to restrain my passions for a few minutes in silence, but I thought I should have died with the effort. —"O my boy, my heart weeps to behold thee thus,
<PB N="152" REF="012405_0150_0F897349B2B097D0"/>
and I cannot, cannot help it. In the moment that I thought thee blest, and prayed for thy safety, to behold thee thus again! Chained, wounded. And yet the death of the youthful is happy. But I am old, a very old man, and have lived to see this day. To see my chil∣dren all untimely falling about me, while I continue a wretched survivor in the midst of ruin! May all the curses that ever sunk a soul fall heavy upon the murderer of my children. May he live, like me, to see—"</P>
<P>"Hold, Sir," replied my son, "or I shall blush for thee. How, Sir, forgetful of your age, your holy calling, thus to arrogate the justice of heaven, and fling those curses upward that must soon descend to crush thy own grey head with destruction! No, Sir, let it be your care now to fit me for that vile death I must shortly suffer, to arm me with hope and resolution, to give me courage to drink of that bitterness which must shortly be my por∣tion"</P>
<P>"My child, you must not die: I am sure no offence of thine can deserve so vile a punishment. My George could never be guilty of any crime to make his ancestors ashamed of him."</P>
<P>"Mine, Sir," returned my son, "is, I fear, and un∣pardonable one. I have sent a challenge, and that is death by a late-act of parliament. When I received my mother's letter from home, I immediately came down, determined to punish the betrayer of our honour and sent him an order to meet me, which he answered, not in person, but by his dispatching four of his domestics to seize me. I wounded one, but the rest made me their priso∣ner. The coward is determined to put the law in execu∣tion against me, the proofs are undeniable; and as I am the first transgressor upon the statute, I see no hopes of pardon. But you have often charmed me with the les∣sons of fortitude, let me now, Sir, find them in your example,"</P>
<P>"And, my son, you shall find them. I am now raised above this world, and all the pleasures it can produce. From this moment I break from my heart all the ties that held it down to earth, and will prepare to fit us both for eternity. Yes, my son, I will point out the way, and my soul shall guide yours in the ascent, for
<PB N="153" REF="012405_0151_0F89734A71D9DB28"/>
we will take our flight together. I now see and am convinced you can expect no pardon here, and I can only exhort you to seek it at that greatest tribunal where we both shall shortly answer. But let us not be niggardly in our exhortation, but let all our fellow prisoners have a share: good gaoler, let them be permitted to stand here, while I attempt to improve them." Thus saying, I made an effort to rise from my straw, but wanted strength, and was able only to recline against the wall. The prisoners assembled according to my directions, for they loved to hear my council, my son and his mother supported me on either side, I looked and saw that none were wanting, and then addressed them with the following exhortation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The equal dealings of providence demonstrated with re∣gard to the happy and the miserable here below. That from the nature of pleasure and pain, the wretched must be repaid the balance of their sufferings in the life hereafter.</HEAD>
<P>MY friends, my children, and fellow-sufferers, when I reflect on the distribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to enjoy, yet still more to suffer. Though we should examine the whole world, we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing left to wish for; but we daily see thousands who by suicide shew us they have nothing left to hope. In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely blest, but yet we may be completely miserable!</P>
<P>Why man should thus feel pain, why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity, why, when all other systems are made perfect only by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great sys∣tem should require for its perfection, parts that are not only subordinate to others, but imperfect in themselves?
<PB N="154" REF="012405_0152_0F89734B33841470"/>
These are questions that never can be explained, and might be useless if known. On this subject providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity, satisfied with granting us motives to consolation</P>
<P>In this situation, man has called in the friendly assist∣ance of philosophy, and heaven seeing the incapacity of that to console him, has given him the aid of religion. The consolations of philosophy are very amusing, but often fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with com∣forts, if we will but enjoy them; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have miseries here, life is short, and they will soon be over. Thus do these con∣solations destroy each other; for if life is a place of com∣fort, its shortness must be misery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philosophy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher strain. Man is here, it tells us, sitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him∣self a heaven of happiness here, while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has antici∣pated the vengeance of heaven. To religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending, and if we are miserable, it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest. Thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliss, to the wretched a change from pain.</P>
<P>But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy; the sick, the naked, the houseless, the heavy-laden, and the prisoner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law. The author of our religion every where professes himself the wretch's friend, and unlike the false ones of this world bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn. The unthink∣ing have censured this as partiality, as a preference with out merit to deserve it. But they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable. To the first eternity is but a single blessing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="155" REF="012405_0153_0F89734BF10A69B0"/>
since at most it but encreases what they already possess. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimi∣nishes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter.</P>
<P>But providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths the passage there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of sorrows lays himself quietly down, he has no possessions to regret, and but few ties to stop his de∣parture: he feels only nature's pang in the final separa∣tion, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the constitution, nature kindly covers with insensibility.</P>
<P>Thus providence has given the wretched two advan∣tages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dy∣ing, and in heaven all that superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment. And this superiority, my friends, is no small advantage, and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven; and felt all the rap∣tures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that he had once been wretched and now was comforted, that he had known what it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you see religion does what philoso∣phy could never do: it shews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy and to the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard. It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal hopes to aspire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here, the poor have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable, when crowned with endless felicity hereafter; and even though this should be called a small advantage, yet being an eternal one, it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of the great may have ex∣ceeded by intenseness.</P>
<P>These are therefore the consolations which the wretch∣ed have peculiar to themselves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind; in other respects they are
<PB N="156" REF="012405_0154_0F89734D777E7B60"/>
below them. They who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believe or practise. The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor, and they who want them must be miserable. Yes, my friends we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature, can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these. Alas! the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain! Death is slight, and any man sustains it; but tor∣ments are dreadful, and these no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us then, my friends, the promises of happiness in heaven should be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then indeed of all men the most miserable. When I look round these gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us: this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place, those shackles that tyranny has imposed, or crime made necessary: when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for these. To fly through regions unconfin∣ed as air, to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss, to carol over endless hymns of praise, to have no master to threaten or insult us, but the form of goodness himself for ever in our eyes, when I think of these things, death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings; when I think of these things, his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my sup∣port; when I think of these things, what is there in life worth having? When I think of these things, what is there that should not be spurned away? Kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages; but we, hum∣bled as we are, should yearn for them.</P>
<P>And shall these things be ours? Ours they will cer∣tainly be, if we but try for them; and what is a comfort, we are shut out from many temptations that would retard our pursuit. Only let us try for them: and they will certainly be ours, and what is still a comfort, shortly too; for if we look back on past life, it appears but a very short span, and whatever we may think of the rest
<PB N="157" REF="012405_0155_0F89734E706E6830"/>
of life, it will yet be found of less duration; as we grow older the days seem to grow shorter, and our intimacy with time ever lessens the perception of his stay. Then let us take comfort now, for we shall soon be at our journey's end; we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us, and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and like his horizon, still flies before him; yet the time will certainly and shortly come, when we shall cease from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth; when we shall think with pleasure on our suffer∣ings below; when we shall be surrounded with all our friends, or such as deserved our friendship; when our bliss shall be unutterable, and still, to crown all, unending.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Happier prospects begin to appear. Let us be inflexible, and fortune will at last change in our favour.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I had thus finished and my audience was retired, the gaoler, who was one of the most humane of his profession, hoped I would not be displeased, as what he did was but his duty, observing that he must be obliged to remove my son into a stronger cell, but that he should be permitted to revisit me every morning. I thanked him for his clemency, and grasping my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was before him.</P>
<P>I again therefore laid me down, and one of my little ones sat by my bedside reading, when Mr. Jenkinson entering, informed me that there was news of my daugh∣ter; for that she was seen by a person about two hours before in a strange gentleman's company, and that they had stopt at a neighbouring village for refreshment, and seemed as if returning to town. He had scarce delivered this news, when the gaoler came with looks of haste and pleasure, to inform me, that my daughter was found.
<PB N="158" REF="012405_0156_0F89734EF19FD798"/>
Moses came running in a moment after, crying out that his sister Sophy was below, and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</P>
<P>Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered, and with looks almost wild with pleasure, ran to kiss me in a transport of affection. Her mother's tears and silence also shewed her pleasure—"Here, papa," cried the charming girl, "here is the brave man to whom I owe "my delivery; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am in∣debted for my happiness and safety.—" A kiss from Mr. Burchell, whose pleasure seemed even greater than hers, interrupted what she was going to add.</P>
<P>"Ah, Mr. Burchell," cried I, "this is but a wretch∣ed habitation you now find us in; and we are now very different from what you last saw us. You were ever our friend: we have long discovered our errors with regard to you, and repented of our ingratitude. After the vile usage you then received at my hands, I am almost ashamed to behold your face; yet I hope you'll forgive me, as I was deceived by a base ungene∣rous wretch, who, under the mask of friendship has undone me."</P>
<P>"It is impossible," replied Mr. Burchell, "that I should forgive you, as you never deserved my resentment. I partly saw your delusion then, and as it was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity it!"</P>
<P>"It was ever my conjecture," cried I, "that your mind was noble; but now I find it so. But tell me, my dear child, how hast thou been relieved, or who the ruffians were who carried thee away?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," replied she, "as to the villain who brought me off, I am yet ignorant. For as my mam∣ma and I were walking out, he came behind us, and almost before I could call for help, forced me into the post-chaise, and in an instant the horses drove away. I met several on the road, to whom I cried out for assistance; but they disregarded my entreaties. In the mean time the ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and threatened by turns, and swore that if I continued but silent, he in∣tended no harm. In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom should I per∣ceive
<PB N="159" REF="012405_0157_0F89734FB54C8418"/>
at some distance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his usual swiftness, with the great stick for which we used so much to ridicule him. As soon as we came within hearing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my ex∣clamations several times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the postilion stop; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with still greater speed. I now thought he could never overtake us, when in less than a minute I saw Mr. Burchell come running up by the side of the horses, and with one blow knock the postilion to the ground. The horses when he was fallen soon stopt of themselves, and the ruffian stepping out, with oaths and menaces drew his sword, and order∣ed him at his peril to retire; but Mr. Burchell run∣ning up, shivered his sword to pieces, and then pur∣sued him for near a quarter of a mile; but he made his escape. I was at this time come out myself, willing to assist my deliverer; but he soon returned to me in tri∣umph. The postilion, who was recovered, was going to make his escape too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back to town. Finding it impossible to resist, he reluctantly complied, though the wound he had received seemed, to me at least, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along, so that he at last excited Mr. Burchell's compassion, who, at my request, exchang∣ed him for another at an inn where we called on our return."</P>
<P>"Welcome then," cried I, "my child, and thou her gallant deliverer, a thousand welcomes. Though our cheer is but wretched, yet our hearts are ready to re∣ceive you. And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have de∣livered my girl, if you think her a recompence she is yours, if you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine, take her, obtain her consent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine. And let me tell you, Sir, that I give you no small treasure, sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been celebrated for beauty it is true, but that is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meaning, I give you up a treasure in her mind."</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="012405_0158_0F89735072AF3C28"/>"But I suppose, Sir" cried Mr. Burchell, "that you are apprized of my circumstances, and of my incapacity to support her as she deserves?"</P>
<P>"If your present objection," replied I, be meant as an evasion of my offer, I desist: but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you; and if I could give her thousands, and thousands sought her from me, yet my honest brave Burchell should be my dearest choice."</P>
<P>To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortify∣ing refusal, and without the least reply to my offer, he, demanded if we could not be furnished with refreshment from the next inn? To which being answered in the af∣firmative, he ordered them to send in the best dinner that could be provided upon such short notice. He bespoke also a dozen of their best wine; and some cordials for me. Adding, with a smile, that he would stretch a little for once, and tho' in a prison, asserted he was never better disposed to be merry. The waiter soon made his appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the gaoler, who seemed remarkably assiduous, the wine was disposed in order, and two very well-drest dishes were brought in.</P>
<P>My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy situation, and we all seemed unwilling to damp her chearfulness by the relation. But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful, the circum∣stances of my unfortunate son broke through all efforts to dissemble: so that I was at last obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes, and wishing that he might be permitted to share with us in this little interval of satisfaction. After my guests were recovered from the consternation my account had produced, I requested also that Mr. Jenkinson a fellow prisoner might be ad∣mitted, and the gaoler granted my request with an air of vnusual submission. The clanking of my son's irons was no sooner heard along the passage, than his sister ran im∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell in the mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> asked me if my son's name was George, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in the affirmative, he still continued silent. As soon as my boy entred the room, I could perceive he regarded Mr. Burchell with a look of astonishment and reverence. "Come on," cried I, "my son, though we

are fallen very low, yet providence has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from pain. Thy sister is restored to us, and there is her deliverer; to that brave man it is that I am indebeted for yet having a daughter, give him▪ my boy, the hand of friendship, he deserves our warmest gratitude"</P>
<P>My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said, and still continued fixed at respectful distance—"My dear brother," cried his sister, "why don't you thank my good deliverer; the brave should ever love each other."</P>
<P>He still continued his silence and astonishment, till our guest at last perceived himself to be known, and assuming all his native dignity, desired my son to come forward. Never before had I seen any thing so truly majestic as the air he assumed upon this occasion. The greatest object in the universe, says a certain philosopher, is a good man struggling with adversity; yet there is still a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had regarded my son for some time with a su∣perior air, "I again find," said he, "unthinking boy, that the same crime"—But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler's servants, who came to inform us that a person of distinction, who had driven into town with a chariot and several attendants, sent his respects to the gentleman that was with us, and begged to know when he should think proper to be waited upon.— "Bid the fellow wait, cried our guest, till I shall have leisure to receive him;" and then turning to my son, "I again find, Sir," proceeded he, "that you are guil∣ty of the same offence for which you once had my reproof, and for which the law is now preparing its justest punishment. You imagine, perhaps, that a con∣tempt for your own life, gives you a right to take that of another: but where, Sir, is the difference be∣tween a duelist who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater security? Is it any di∣minution of the gamester's fraud when he alledges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he has staked a counter?"</P>
<P>"Alas, Sir," cried I, "whoever you are, pity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> poor misguided creature; for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother, who in the bitterness
<PB N="162" REF="012405_0160_0F897351F340DD68"/>
of her resentment required him upon her blessing to avenge her quarrel. Here, Sir is the letter, which will serve to convince you of her imprudence and diminish his guilt"</P>
<P>He took the letter and hastily read it over. "This," says he, though not a perfect excuse, is such a palliation of his fault, as induces me to forgive him: And now, Sir" continued he, kindly taking my son by the hand, "I see you are surprized at finding me here; but I have often visited prisons upon occasions less interest∣ing. I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most sincere esteem. I have long been a disguised spectator of thy father's benevolence. I have at his little dwelling enjoyed respect uncontamina∣ted by flattery, and have received that happiness that courts could not give, from the amusing simplicity round his fire-side. My nephew has been apprized of my in∣tentions of coming here, and I find is arrived; it wou'd be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination: if there be injury, there shall be redress; and this' I may say without boasting, that none have ever taxed the injustice of Sir William Thornhill.</P>
<P>We now found the personage whom we had so long entertained as an harmless amusing companion, was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhill, to whose virtues and singularities scarce any were strangers. The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large for∣tune and great interest, to whom senates listened with applause, and whom party heard with conviction; who was the friend of his country, but loyal to his king. My poor wife recollecting her former familiarity, seemed to shrink with apprehension; but Sophia, who a few mo∣ments before thought him her own, now perceiving the immense distance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal her tears.</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir" cried my wife, with a piteous aspect, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible that I can ever have your forgiveness; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts you received from me the last time I had the ho∣nour of seeing you at our house, and the jokes▪ which I audaciously threw out, these jokes, Sir, I fear can never be forgiven."</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="012405_0161_0F897352B236F330"/>"My dear good lady," returned he with a smile, "If you had your joke, I had my answer: I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not as good as yours.— To say the truth, I know no body whom I am disposed to be angry with at present but the fellow who so frighted my little girl here. I had not even time to examine the rascal's person so as to describe him in an advertisement. Can you tell me, Sophia, my dear, whe∣ther you should know him again?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," replied she, "I can't be positive; yet now I recollect he had a large mark over one of his eye-brows." "I ask pardon, madam," interrupted Jenkinson, who was by, "but be so good as to inform me if the fellow wore his own red hair?"—"Yes, I think so," cried Sophia.—"And did your honour," continued he, turning to Sir William, "observe the length of his legs?"—"I can't be sure of their length," cried the Baronet, "but I am convinced of their swiftness; for he out-ran me, which is what I thought few men in the kingdom could have done."—"Please your ho∣nour," cried Jenkinson, "I know the man: it is cer∣tainly the same; the best runner in England; he has beaten Pinwire of Newcastle, Timothy Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter is his name, I know him perfectly, and the very place of his retreat this moment. If your honour will bid Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to produce him to you in an hour at farthest. Upon this the gaoler was called, who instantly appearing, Sir William demanded if he knew him. "Yes, please your honour," reply'd the gaoler, "I know Sir William Thornhill well, and every body that knows any thing of him, will desire to know more of him."—"Well then," said the baronet, "my request is, that you will permit this man and two of your servants to go upon a message by my authority and as I am in the commission of the peace, I undertake to secure you."—"Your promise is sufficient," replied the other, and you may at a minute's warning send them over England whenever your honour thinks fit."</P>
<P>In pursuance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkinson was dispatched in search of Timothy Baxter, while we were amused with the affiduity of our youngest boy Bill, who
<PB N="164" REF="012405_0162_0F89735373B1FE58"/>
had just come in and climbed up to Sir William's neck in order to kiss him. His mother was immediately going to chastise his familiarity, but the worthy man prevented her; and taking the child, all ragged as he was, upon his knee, "What, Bill, you chubby rogue," cried he, "do you remember your old friend Burchell; and Dick too, my honest veteran, are you here, you shall find I have not forgot you." So saying, he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fellows eat very heartily, as they had got that morning but a very scanty breakfast.</P>
<P>We now sat down to dinner, which was almost cold; but previously, my arm still continuing painful, Sir, Wil∣liam wrote a prescription, for he had made the study of physic his amusement, and was more than moderately skilled in the profession; this being sent to an apothecary who lived in the place, my arm was dressed, and I found almost instantaneous relief. We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler himself, who was willing to do our guest all the honour in his power. But before we had well dined, another message was brought from his ne∣phew, desiring permission to appear, in order to vindi∣cate his innocence and honour, with which request the baronet complied, and desired Mr. Thornhill to be in∣troduced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XII. Former benevolence now repaid with unexpected interest.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Thornhill made his entrance with a smile, which he seldom wanted, and was going to em∣brace his uncle, which the other repulsed with an air of disdain. "No fawning, Sir, at present," cried the ba∣ronet, with a look of severity, "the only way to my heart is by the road of honour; but here I only set complicated instances of falsehood, cowardice, and oppression. How is it, Sir, that this poor man, for whom I know you professed a friendship, is used thus
<PB N="165" REF="012405_0163_0F897354F91FDEF0"/>
hardly? His daughter vilely seduced, as a recompence for his hospitality, and he himself thrown into a prison perhaps but for resenting the insult? His son too, whom you feared to face as a man—"</P>
<P>"Is it possible, Sir," interrupted his nephew, "that my uncle could object that as a crime which his re∣peated instructions alone have persuaded me to avoid." "Your rebuke," cried Sir, William, "is just: you have acted in this instance prudently and well, though not quite as your father would have done: my brother indeed was the soul of honour; but thou—yes you have acted in this instance perfectly right, and it has my warmest approbation."</P>
<P>"And I hope," said his nephew, "that the rest of my conduct will not be found to deserve censure. I appeared, Sir, with this gentleman's daughter at some places of public amusement: thus what was levity, scandal called by a harsher name, and it was reported that I had debauched her. I waited on her father in person, willing to clear the thing to his satisfaction, and he received me only with insult and abuse. As for the rest, with regard to his being here, my attorney and steward can best inform you, as I commit the management of business entirely to them. If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them, it is their business to proceed in this man∣ner, and I see no hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress."</P>
<P>"If this, cried Sir William, "be as you have stated it, there is nothing unpardonable in your offence; and though your conduct might have been more generous in not suffering this gentleman to be oppressed by subordi∣nate tyranny, yet it has been at least equitable."</P>
<P>"He cannot contradict a single particular," replied the 'squire, "I defy him to do so, and several of my servants are ready to attest what I say. Thus, Sir," continued he, finding that I was silent, for in fact I could not contradict him, "thus, Sir, my own innocence is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to forgive this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to lessen me in your esteem, excite a resent∣ment that I cannot govern.—And this too at a time
<PB N="166" REF="012405_0164_0F897355F5254920"/>
when his son was actually preparing to take away my life; this, I say, was such guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its course. I have here the challenge that was sent me and two witnesses to prove it; and even though my uncle himself should dissuade me, which I know he will not, yet I will see public justice done, and he shall suffer for it."</P>
<P>"Thou monster," cried my wife, "hast thou not had vengeance enough already, but must my poor boy feel thy cruelty. I hope that good Sir William will protect us, for my son is as innocent as a child; I am sure he is, and never did harm to man."</P>
<P>"Madam," replied the good man, "your wishes for his safety are not greater than mine; but I am sorry to find his guilt too plain; and if my nephew persists—" But the appearance of Jenkinson and the gaoler's two ser∣vants now called off our attention, who entered, haling in a tall man, very genteelly drest, and answering the description already given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter—"Here," cried Jenkinson, pulling him in, "here we have him, and if ever there was a candidate for Tyburn, this is one."</P>
<P>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the prisoner, and Jenkinson who had him in custody, he seemed to shrink back with terror. His face became pale with conscious guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkinson, who perceived his design, stopt him— "What, 'squire, cried he, "are you ashamed of your two old acquaintances, Jenkinson and Baxter: but this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am resolved we will not forget you.— Our prisoner, please your honour," continued he, turn∣ing to Sir William, "has already confessed all.— He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who first put him upon this affair, that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman, and furnished him with the post-chaise. The plan was laid between them that he should carry off the young lady to a place of safety, and that there he should threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in, in the mean time, as if by accident, to her rescue, and that they should fight a while, and then he was to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="167" REF="012405_0165_0F8973567299A4D0"/>
off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have the better op∣portunity of gaining her affections himself under the cha∣racter of her defender."</P>
<P>Sir William remembered the coat to have been fre∣quently worn by his nephew, and all the rest the priso∣ner himself confirmed by a more circumstantial account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both sisters at the same time.</P>
<P>"Heavens," cried Sir William, "what a viper have I been fostering in my bosom! And so fond of public justice too as he seemed to be. But he shall have it; secure him, Mr. Gaoler—yet hold, I fear there is not legal evidence to detain him."</P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the utmost humility, entreated that two such abandoned wretches might not be admitted as evidences against him, but that his servants should be examined.—"Your servants" replied Sir Wil∣liam, "wretch, call them yours no longer: but come let us hear what those fellows have to say, let his butler be called."</P>
<P>When the butler was introduced, he soon perceived by his former master's looks that all his power was now over. "Tell me," cried Sir William sternly, "have you ever seen your master and that fellow drest up in his cloaths in company together?" "Yes, please your honour," cried the butler, "a thousand times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."— "How," interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, "this to my face!"—"Yes," replied the butler, "or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, master Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind."—"Now then," cried Jenkinson, "tell his honour whether you know any thing of me."—"I can't say," replied the butler, "that I know much good of you. The night that gentleman's daughter was deluded to our house, you were one of them,—"So then," cried Sir Wil∣liam, "I find you have brought a very fine witness to prove your innocence: thou stain to humanity! to associate with such wretches!" (But continuing his examination) "You tell me, Mr. Butler, that this
<PB N="168" REF="012405_0166_0F897357318FE1A8"/>
was the person who brought him this old gentleman's daughter,"—"No, please your honour," replied the butler, "he did not bring her, for the 'squire himself undertock that business; but he brought the priest that pretended to marry them."—"It is but too true," cried Jenkinson, "I cannot deny it, that was the em∣ployment assigned me, and I confess it to my confu∣sion."</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the baronet, "how every new discovery of his villainy alarms me. All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his present prosecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice and revenge; at my request, Mr. Gaoler, set this young officer, now your prisoner, free, and trust to me for the consequences.— I'll make it my business to set the affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate who has committed him. But where is the unfortunate young lady herself: let her appear to confront this wretch, I long to know by what arts he has seduced her honour. Entreat her to come in. Where is she?"</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir," said I, "that question stings me to the heart: I was once indeed happy in a daughter, but her miseries."—Another interruption here prevent∣ed me; for who should make her appearance but Miss Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been mar∣ried to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her surprize at seeing Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that she and the old gentleman her father were passing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr. Thornhill should be consum∣mated at her house; but stopping for refreshment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there from the window that the young lady happened to observe one of my little boys playing in the street, and instantly sending a footman to bring the child to her, she learnt from him some account of our misfortunes; but was still kept ignorant of young Mr. Thornhill's be∣ing the cause. Though her father made several remon∣strances on the impropriety of going to a prison to visit us, yet they were ineffectual; she desired the child to
<PB N="169" REF="012405_0167_0F897357F29E6790"/>
conduct her, which he did, and it was thus she surprised us at a juncture so unexpected.</P>
<P>Nor can I go on, without a reflection on those acci∣dental meetings, which, though they happen every day, seldom excite our surprize but upon some extraordinary occasion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives. How many seemiag accidents must unite before we can be cloathed or fed. The peasant must be disposed to labour, the shower must fall, the wind fill the merchant's fail, or numbers must want the usual supply.</P>
<P>We all continued silent for some moments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compassion and astonishment, which gave new finishings to her beauty. "Indeed, my dear Mr. Thornhill," cried she to the 'squire, who she supposed was come here to succour and not to oppress us; "I take it a little unkindly that you should come here without me, or never inform me of the situation of a family so dear to us both; you know I should take as much pleasure in contributing to the relief of my reverend old master here, whom I shall ever esteem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a pleasure in doing good in secret."</P>
<P>"He find pleasure in doing good!" cried Sir Wil∣liam, interrupting her. "No, my dear, his pleasures are as base as he is.—You see in him, madam, as complete a villain as ever disgraced humanity. A wretch, who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting against the innocence of her sister, has thrown the father into prison, and the eldest son into fetters, because he had courage to face his betrayer.— And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an escape from the embraces of such a monster."</P>
<P>"O goodness," cried the lovely girl, "how have I been deceived! Mr. Thornhill informed me for cer∣tain that this gentleman's eldest son, Captain Primrose, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</P>
<P>"My sweetest miss," cried my wife, "he has told you nothing but falsehoods. My son George never left the kingdom, nor ever was married. Tho' you
<PB N="170" REF="012405_0168_0F897358B42AB4B0"/>
have forsaken him, he has always loved you too well to think of any body else; and I have heard him say "he would die a batchelor for your sake." She then proceed∣ed to expatiate upon the sncerity of her son's passion, she set his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light, from thence she made a rapid digression to the 'squire's debaucheries, his pretended marriages, and ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice.</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" cried Miss Wilmot, how very "near have I been to the brink of ruin! But how great is my pleasure to have escaped it! Ten thousand falsehoods has this gentleman told me! He had at last art enough to persuade me that my promise to the only man I esteemed was no longer binding, since he had been un∣faithful. By his falsehoods I was taught to detest one equally brave and generous!"</P>
<P>But by this time my son was freed from the incum∣brances of justice. Mr. Jenkinson also, who had acted as his valet de chambre, had dressed up his hair, and fur∣nished him with whatever was necessary to make a gen∣teel appearance. He now therefore entered, handsomely drest in his regimentals, and without vanity, (for I am above it) he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress. As he entered, he made Miss Wilmot a modest and distant bow, for he was not as yet acquaint∣ed with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no decorums could re∣strain the impatience of his blushing mistress to be for∣given. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to discover the real sensations of her heart for having forgotten her former promise, and having suffered herself to be delud∣ed by an impostor. My son appeared amazed at her condescension, and could scarce believe it real.—"Sure, madam," cried he, "this is but delusion! I can ne∣ver have merited this! To be blest thus is to be too happy."—No, Sir, replied she, "I have been de∣ceived, basely deceived, else nothing could have ever made me unjust to my promise. You know my friend∣ship, you have long known it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warmest vows of con∣stancy, you shall now have them repeated; and be assured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, she shall
<PB N="171" REF="012405_0169_0F89735971AD73F8"/>
never be another's."—"And no other's you shall be," cried Sir William, "if I have any influence with your father."</P>
<P>This hint was sufficient for my son Moses, who imme∣diately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of every circumstance that had happened. But in the mean time the 'squire perceiving that he was on every side undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery and dissimulation, concluded that his wisest way would be to turn and face his pursuers. Thus laying aside all shame, he appeared the open hardy vil∣lain. "I find then," cried he, "that I am to expect no justice here; but I am resolved it shall be done me.— "You shall know, Sir," turning to Sir William, "I am no longer a power depending upon your favours. I scorn them. Nothing can keep Miss Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's assiduity, is pret∣ty large. The articles, and a bond for her fortune, are signed, and safe in my possession. It was her fortune, not her person, that induced me to wish for this match, and possessed of the one, let who will take the other."</P>
<P>This was an alarming blow, Sir William was sensible of the justice of his claims, for he had been instrumen∣tal in drawing up the marriage articles himself. Miss Wilmot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irre∣trievably lost, turning to my son, she asked if the loss of fortune could lessen her value to him. "Though for∣tune." said she, "is out of my power, at least I have my hand to give."</P>
<P>"And that, madam," cried her real lover, was indeed "all that you ever had to give; at least all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now protest, my Arabella by all that's happy, your want of fortune this moment encreases my pleasure, as it serves to convince my sweet girl of my sincerity."</P>
<P>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he seemed not a little pleased at the danger his daughter had just escaped, and readily consented to a dissolution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was secured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing could exceed his disappointment. He now saw that his
<PB N="172" REF="012405_0170_0F89735A33372138"/>
money must all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a rascal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He sat therefore for some minutes employed in the most mortifying speculations till Sir William attempted to les∣sen his anxiety.—"I must confess, Sir," cried he, "that your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished. But tho' the young lady cannot be rich, she has still a competence sufficient to give content. Here you see an honest young soldier, who is willing to take her without fortune; they have long loved each other, and for the friendship I bear his father, my interest shall not be wanting for his promotion. Leave then that ambi∣tion which disappoints you, and for once admit happi∣ness which courts your acceptance"</P>
<P>"Sir William," replied the old gentleman, "be as∣sured I never yet forced her inclinations, nor will I now. If she still continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is still, thank heaven, some fortune left, and your promise will make it something more. Only let my old friend here (mean∣ing me) give me a promise of settling six thousand pounds upon my girl, if ever he should come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the first to join them together."</P>
<P>As it now remained with me to make the young cou∣ple happy, I readily gave a promise of making the set∣tlement he required, which to one who had such little expectations as I, was no great favour — We had now therefore the satisfaction of seeing them fly into each other's arms in a transport. "After all my misfortunes." cried my son George, "to be thus rewarded! Sure this is more than I could ever have presumed to hope for.— To be possessed of all that's good, and after such an interval of pain! My warmest wishes could never rise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o high!"—"Yes, my George," returned his lovely bride, now let the wretch take my fortune; since you are happy without it, so am I. O what an exchange have I made from the basest of men to the dearest, best.—Let him enjoy our fortune, I now can
<PB N="173" REF="012405_0171_0F89735AF2BF6CB0"/>
be happy even in indigence."—"And I pro∣mise you," cried the 'squire, with a malicious grin, "that I shall be very happy with what you despise." —Hold, hold, Sir," cried Jenkinson, "there are two words to that bargain.—As for that lady's fortune, Sir, you shall never touch a single stiver of it. Pray your honour," continued he to Sir William, "can the 'squire have this lady's fortune if he be mar∣ried to another?"—"How can you make such a simple demand," replied the baronet, "undoubtedly he can∣not."—"I am sorry for that," cried Jenkinson; for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow sporters, I have a friendship for him. But I must de∣clare, well as I love him, that his contract is not worth a tobacco stopper, for he is married already." "—You lie like a rascal," returned the 'squire, who seemed rouzed by this insult, "I never was legally married to any woman."—"Indeed, begging your honour's pardon," replied the other, "you were; and I hope you will shew a proper return of friend∣ship to your own honest Jenkinson, who brings you a wife, and if the company restrain their curiosity a few minutes, they shall see her."—So saying he went off with his usual celerity, and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture as to his design.—"Ay let him go," cried the 'squire, "whatever else I may have done I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened with 'squibs."</P>
<P>"I am surprised," said the baronet, "what the fellow can intend by this. Some low piece of humour I sup∣pose!—"Perhaps, Sir," replied I, "he may have a more serious meaning.—For when we reflect on the various schemes this gentleman laid to seduce inno∣cence, perhaps some one, more artful than the rest, has been found able to deceive him. When we con∣sider what numbers he has ruined, how many parents now feel with anguish the infamy and the contamina∣tion which he has brought into their families, it would not surprise me if some one of them.—Amazement! Do I see my lost daughter! Do I hold her! It is, it is my life, my happiness. I thought thee lost, my Olivia, yet still I hold thee—and still shalt thou live
<PB N="174" REF="012405_0172_0F89735BB0F94310"/>
to bless me."—The warmest transports of the fondest lover were not greater than mine when I saw him intro∣duce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, whose silence only spoke her raptures. "And art thou return∣ed to me, my darling," cried I, "to be my comfort in age!"—"That she is," cried Jenkinson, "and make much of her, for she is your own honourable child, and as honest a woman as any in the whole room, let the other be who she will. And as for you, 'squire, as sure as you stand there, this young lady is your lawful wedded wife. And to convince you that I speak no∣thing but truth, here is the licence by which you were married together."—So saying, he put the licence into the baronet's hands, who read it, and found it per∣fect in every respect. "And now, gentlemen," con∣tinued he, "I find you are surprised at all this; but a few words will explain the difficulty. That there 'squire of renown, for whom I have a great friendship, but that's between ourselves, has often employed me in doing odd little things for him. Among the rest he commissioned me to procure him a false licence and a false priest, in order to deceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do but I went and got a true licence and a true priest, and married them both as fast as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'd think it was generosity that made me do all this. But no. To my shame I confess it, my only design was to keep the licence, and let the 'squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and so make him come down whenever I wanted money." A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the whole apartment; our joy reached even to the common room, where the prisoners themselves sympathized,

<P>Happine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s expanded upon every face, and even Oli∣via's cheek seemed flushed with pleasure. To be thus restored to reputation, to friends and fortune at once was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay
<PB N="175" REF="012405_0173_0F89735D38B889D0"/>
and restore former health and vivacity. But perhaps among all there was not one who felt sincerer pleasure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my arms, I asked my heart if these transports were not delusion. "How could you," cried I turning to Mr. Jenkinson, "how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain."</P>
<P>"As to your question▪" replied Jenkinson, "that is easily answered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison, was by submitting to the 'squire, and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady. But there you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living: there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by per∣suading you that she was dead. I prevailed on your wife to join in the deceit, and we have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now."</P>
<P>In the whole assembly now there only appeared two faces that did not glow with transport. Mr. Thornhill's assurance had entirely forsaken him: he now saw the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lph of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of piercing misery implored compassion. Sir William was going to spurn him away, but at my request be raised him, and after pausing a few moments. "Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude," cried he, "deserves no tenderness; yet thou shalt not be en∣tirely forsaken, a bare competence shall be supplied, to support the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, shall be put in posession of a third part of that fortune which once was thine, and from her te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦derness alone thou art to expect any extraordinary sup∣plies for the future." He was going to express his gra∣titude for such kindness in a set speech; but the Baronet prevented him by bidding him not to aggravate his mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess, which was already but too aparent. He or∣dered him at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me time to be gone▪ and from all his former domestics to chuse out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such as he should think p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>per, which was all that should be granted to amend him.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="012405_0174_0F89735E36E9BD40"/>As soon as he left us, Sir William very politely stept up to his new niece with a smile, and wished her joy.</P>
<P>His example was followed by Miss Wilmot and her father; my wife too kissed her daughter with much affec∣tion, as, to use her own expression, she was now made an honest woman of. Sophia and Moses followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkinson desired to be admit∣ted to that honour. Our satisfaction seemed scarce capable of increase. Sir William, whose greatest plea∣sure was in doing good, now looked round with a coun∣tenance open as the sun, and saw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of my daughter Sophia, who, for some reasons we could not comprehend, did not seem perfectly satisfied. "I think now," cried he, with a smile, "that all the company, except one or two, seem perfectly happy. There only remains an act of justice for me to do. You are sensible, Sir," continued he, turning to me, "of the obligations we both owe Mr. Jenkinson for his late assiduity in detecting a scoundrel. It is but just we should both reward him for it.— Your youngest daughter Miss Sophia, will, I am sure, make him very happy, and he shall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune, and upon this I am sure they can live very comfortably together. Come, Miss Sophia, what say you to this match of my making? Will you have him?"—My poor girl seemed almost sinking into her mother's arms at the hideous proposal.— "Have him, Sir!" cried she faintly. "No, Sir, never." "What." cried he again, "not have Mr. Jenkinson, your benefactor, an handsome young fellow, with five hundred pounds and good expectations!"—"I beg, Sir," returned she, scarce able to speak, "that you'll desist, and not make me so very wretched."—"Was ever such obstinacy known." cried he again, "to refuse a man whom the family has such infinite obligations to, who preserved your sister. What, not have him!"— "No, Sir, never," replied she angrily, "I'd soon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> die first."—"If that be the case t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, cried he, "if you will not have him— I think I must have you myself." And so saying he caught her to his breast with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dour. "My loveliest, my most sensible of girls." cried he, "how could you ever think your own Burchell could

deceive you, or that Sir William Thornhill could ever cease to admire a mistress that loved him for himself a∣lone? I have for some years sought for a woman, who, a stranger to my fortune, could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even amongst the pert and ugly, how great at last must be my rapture to have made a conquest over such sense and such heavenly beauty!" Then turning to Jenkinson, "As I cannot, Sir, part with this young lady myself, for she has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the recompence I can make is to give you her fortune; and you may call upon my steward to-morrow for five hundred pounds." Thus we had all our compliments to repeat, and Lady Thorn∣hill underwent the same round of ceremony that her sister had done before. In the mean time Sir William's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where every thing was pre∣pared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left those gloomy mansions of sorrow. The gene∣rous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be distributed a∣mong the prisoners, and Mr. Wilmot, induced by his ex∣ample, gave half that sum. We were received below by the shouts of the villagers, and I saw and shook by the hand two or three of my honest parishioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn, where a sumptuous entertainment was provided▪ and coarser provisions distributed in great quantities among the po∣pulace.</P>
<P>After supper, as my spirits were exhausted by the al∣teration of pleasure and pain which they had sustained during the day, I asked permission to withdraw, and leav∣ing the company in the midst of their mirth, as soon as I found myself alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of sorrow, and then slept undisturbed till morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning as soon as I awakened, I found my eldest son sitting by my bed-side, who came to encrease my joy with another turn of fortune in my fa∣vour. First having released me from the settlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arrested at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's generosity pleased me almost as much as this unlooked for good fortune. But I had some doubts whether I ought in justice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon this, sir Willi∣am entered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion was, that as my son was already possessed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any hesitation. His busi∣ness, however, was to inform me, that as he had the night before sent for the licences, and expected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refuse my assistance in making all the company happy that morning. A foot∣man entered while we were speaking, to tell us that the messenger was returned, and as I was by this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as mer∣ry as affluence and innocence could make them. How∣ever, as they were now preparing for a very solemn ce∣remony, their laughter entirely displeased me. I told them of the grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own composition, in order to prepare them. Yet they still seemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gravity had quite forsaken them, and I was often tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma arose, which promised no easy solution. This was, which couple should be married first; my son's bride warmly insisted, That lady Thornhill (that was to be) should
<PB N="179" REF="012405_0177_0F897360325377F8"/>
take the lead; but this the other refused with equal ar∣dour, protesting she would not be guilty of such rude∣ness for the world. The argument was supported for some time between both with equal obstinacy and good breeding. But as I stood all this time with my book ready, I was at last quite tired of the contest, and shutting it, "I perceive," cried I, "that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I suppose there will be no business done here to-day."—This at once reduced them to reason. The Baronet and his Lady were first married, and then my son and his lovely partner.</P>
<P>I had previously that morning given orders that a coach should be sent for my honest neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the pleasure of finding the two Miss Flam∣boroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkinson gave his hand to the eldest, and my son Moses led up the other: (and I have since found that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my consent and bounty he shall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them.) We were no sooner returned to the inn, but numbers of my pari∣shioners, hearing of my success, came to congratulate me, but among the rest were those who rose to rescue me, and whom I formerly rebuked with such sharpness. I told the story to Sir William, my son-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great severity; but finding them quite disheartened by his harsh reproof, he gave them half a guinea a-piece to drink his health, and raise their dejected spirits.</P>
<P>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel enter∣taiment, which was drest by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to observe with respect to that gentleman, that he now resides in quality of com∣panion at a relation's house, being very well liked and seldom sitting at the side-table, except when there is no room at the other; for they make no stranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keeping his relation, who is a little melancholy, in spirits, and in learning to blow the French-horn. My eldest daughter, however, still remembers him with regret; and she has even told me, though I make a great secret of it, that when he re∣forms
<PB N="180" REF="012405_0178_0F897360F80C5F98"/>
she may be brought to relent. But to return, for I am not apt to digress thus; when we were to sit down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The question was whether my eldest daughter, as being a matron, should not sit above the two young brides, but the debate was cut short by my son George, who proposed, that the company should sit indiscriminately, every gentleman by his lady. This was received with great approbation by all, excepting my wife, who I could perceive was not perfectly satisfied, as she ex∣pected to have had the pleasure of sitting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company. But notwithstanding this, it is impossible to describe our good humour. I can't say whether we had more wit amongst us now than usual; but I am certain we had more laughing, which answered the end as well. One jest I particularly remember, old Mr. Wilmot drinking to Moses, whose head was turned another way, my son re∣plied, "Madam, I thank you." Upon which the old gentleman, winking upon the rest of the company, ob∣served that he was thinking of his mistress. At which jest I thought the two Miss Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As soon as dinner was over, accor∣ding to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my fa∣mily assembled once more by a chearful fire-side. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the compa∣ny by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.</P>
