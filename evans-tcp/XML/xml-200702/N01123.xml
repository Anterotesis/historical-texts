<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a Satyrical Answer, and deeply reproachful to Mankind, which the <HI>Phi∣losopher</HI> gave to that Question, <HI>What soonest grows old?</HI> Replyed, <HI>Thanks.</HI> The reproach of it would not be so sen∣sible, were there not sensible Demonstrations of the Truth of it, in those that wear the Cha∣racter of the Ingenuous. Such as are at first Surprized at, and seem to have no common re∣lish of Divine Goodness; yet too soon lose the Impression: <HI>They Sang God's Praise, but soon forgat His Works.</HI> That it should be thus with respect to our <HI>Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>factors</HI> on Earth, is contrary to the Ingenuity of Humane Nature: But that
<PB REF="001340_0004_0FB2821003142D70"/>
our grateful Resentments of the Signal Favours of Heaven, should soon be worn off by Time, is to the last degree Criminal and Unpardona∣ble.</P>
<P>It would be unaccountable Stupidity in me, not to maintain the most Lively and Awful Sense of Divine Rebukes, which the Holy GOD has seen meet in Spotless Sovereignty to dispense to me, my Family and People, in delivering us into the hands of those that Hated us: who Led us into a strange Land; <HI>My Soul has These still in Remembrance, and is Humbled in me:</HI> However GOD has given us plentiful occasion to Sing of Mercy as well as Judgment. The wonders of Divine Mercy, which we have seen in the Land of our Captivity, and Deliverance there-from, cannot be forgotten without incurring the guilt of the blackest Ingratitude.</P>
<P>To preserve the Memory of <HI>These,</HI> it has been thought adviseable to Publish a Short Ac∣count of some of <HI>Those</HI> Signal Appearances of Divine Power and Goodness for us; hoping it may Serve to excite the <HI>Praise, Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> of all that Love GOD; And may pe∣cultarly Serve to Cherish a <HI>Grateful Spirit,</HI> and to render the Impressions of GOD'<HI>S</HI> Mighty Works indelible on my Heart, and on

<HI>Those</HI> that with me, have seen the Wonders of the Lord, and Tasted of His Salvation: That we may not fall under that heavy Charge made a∣gainst <HI>Israel</HI> of old, Psal. 78. 11, 42. <HI>They forgat His works, and the wonders He shewed them: They remembred not His Hand, nor the Day that He delivered them from the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>And I cannot <HI>SIR,</HI> but think it most agree∣able to my Duty to GOD our Supream Re∣deemer, to mention your <HI>EXCELLENCY'S</HI> Name with Honour; Since Heaven has Ho∣noured you as the prime Instrument in returning our Captivity. Sure I am, The Laws of Justice and Gratitude (which are the Laws of God) do challenge from us the most Publick acknow∣ledgments of your uncommon Sympathy with us, your Children, in our bonds, Expressed in all Endearing methods of Parental Care and Tenderness. All your People are cherisht un∣der your Wings, happy in your Goverment; and are obliged to Bless GOD for you: And among your People, those that are immediately exposed to the Outrages of the Enemy, have pe∣culiarly felt Refreshment from the benign In∣fluences of your Wise and Tender Conduct; and are under the most Sensible engagements to ac∣knowledge your EXCELLENCY, under GOD, as the breath of their Nostrils.</P>
<P><PB REF="001340_0006_0FB2821A6E2DF9C8"/>
Your Uncommon Sagacity and Prudence, in contriving to loose the Bonds of your Captived Children; your unwearied Vigour, and Appli∣cation, in pursuing them, to work our Delive∣rance, can never be enough Praised. It is most Notorious that nothing was thought too Dif∣ficult by you to Effect this Design; in that you readily sent your own Son, Mr. <HI>William Dudley,</HI> to undergo the hazards &amp; hardships of a Tedi∣ous Voyage, that this affair might be Transacted with Success; which must not be forgotten, as an Expression of your great Solicitude &amp; Zeal to recover us from the Tyranny &amp; Oppression of our Captivity.</P>
<P>I doubt not but that the GOD, whom herein you have Served, will remember, and gloriously Reward you; And may Heaven long preserve you at our Helm, a Blessing so necessary for the Tranquility of this Province, in this Dark and Tempestuous Season; May the best of Blessings from the Father of Lights, be showred down up∣on your Person, Family &amp; Government; which shall be the Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>THE Redeemed Captive, Returning TO ZION.</HEAD>
<P>THE History I am going to Write, proves, That Days of <HI>Fasting</HI> &amp; <HI>Prayer</HI> without REFORMATION, will not avail, to Turn away the Anger of God from a Professing People; &amp; yet Witnesseth, How very advantagious, gracious Supplications are, to prepare particular Christians, Patiently to suffer the Will of God, in very trying Publick Calamities. For some of us moved with fear, set apart, a day of <HI>Prayer,</HI> to ask of God, either to spare, and save us from the hands of our Ene∣mies, or to prepare us to Sanctify, and Honour Him in what way soever, He should come sorth, towards us. The Places of Scripture from whence we were entertained, were <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 10, 11. <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth which thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast shewed unto thy servant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Deliver me, I pray
<PB N="2" REF="001340_0008_0FB2821F2C8F2A60"/>
thee, from the hand of my Brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the Mother with the Children.</HI> [In the forenoon.] And <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 26. <HI>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh: and he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</HI> [In the afternoon.] From which we were call'd upon to spread the causes of fear, relating to our own Selves, or Families before God; as also, how it becomes us with an undeniable importunity to be following God, with earnest Prayers for His blessing, in every condition. And it is very Obser∣vable; how <HI>GOD</HI> ordered our Prayers, in a peculiar manner to be going up to Him; to prepare us with a right <HI>Christian Spirit,</HI> to undergo, and endure Suffering Trials.</P>
<P>Not long after, the Holy, and Righteous God, brought us under great Trials, as to our Persons and Families, which put us under a necessity, of spread∣ing before Him in a Wilderness, the distressing dan∣gers and calamities of our Relations; Yea, that call'd on us notwithstanding seeming present frowns, to resolve by His Grace not to be sent away with∣out a blessing. <HI>Jacob</HI> in wrestling has the hollow of his Thigh put out of joint; and it is said to him, <HI>Let me go:</HI> yet he is rather animated, to an Heroical Christian resolution to continue earnest, for the blessing, than discouraged from asking.</P>
<P>ON the Twenty-ninth of <HI>February</HI> 1703, 4. Not long before break of day, the Enemy came in like a Flood upon us; our Watch being unfaithful▪ an evil whose awful effects, in a sur∣prizal
<PB N="3" REF="001340_0009_0FB28222ED10E938"/>
of our Fort, should bespeak all Watchmen to avoid, as they would not bring the charge of blood upon themselves. They came to my House in the beginning of the Onset, and by their violent en∣deavours to break open Doors, and Windows, with <HI>Axes,</HI> and <HI>Hatchets,</HI> Awaken'd me out of Sleep; on which I leapt out of bed, and running toward the door, perceived the Enemy making their entrance into the House: I called to awaken two Souldiers; in the Chamber; and returned towards my bed∣side, for my Arms: the Enemy immediately brake into the Room, I judge to the number of Twenty, with <HI>Painted Faces,</HI> and hideous Acclamations. I reach'd up my hands to the Bed-tester, for my Pistol, uttering a short Petition to God, <HI>For Everlasting Mercies for me &amp; mine, on the account of the Merits of our Glorify'd Redeemer;</HI> Expecting a present passage through the Valley of the shadow of Death: Saying in my self, as <HI>Isaiah</HI> 38. 10, 11. <HI>I said, in the cutting off my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the Living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the World.</HI> Taking down my Pistol, I Cockt it, and put it to the breast of the first Indian who came up; but my Pistol missing fire, I was seized by Three Indians, who dis∣armed me, and bound me Naked, as I was in, my Shirt, and so I stood for near the space of an hour: binding me, they told me they would carry me to <HI>Quebeck.</HI> My Pistol missing fire, was an occasion of my Life's being preserved: Since which I have also found it profitable to be cross'd in my own

Will. The judgment of God did not long slumber▪ against one of the Three which took me, who was a Captain, for by Sun-rising he received a Mortal Shot▪ from my next Neighbours house; who oppo∣sed so great a number of <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians</HI> as Three hundred, and yet were no more than Seven men in an Ungarison'd house.</P>
<P>I cannot relate the distressing care I had for my dear Wife, who had lien-in but a few Weeks before, and for my poor Children, Family, and Christian Neighbours. The Enemy fell to riffling the house, and entred in great numbers into every room of the house. I beg'd of God, to Remember Mercy in the midst of Judgment: that He would so far restain their Wrath, as to prevent their Mur∣dering of us: that we might have <HI>Grace to Glorify His Name, whether in Life or Death;</HI> and as I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> able committed our State to God. The Enemies who entred the House were all of them <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Marqua's,</HI> insulted over me a while, holding up Hat∣chets over my head, threatning to burn all I had; but yet God beyond expectation made us in a great measure to be Pityed: for tho' some were so cruel and barbarous as to take, &amp; carry to the door, Two of my Children and Murder them, as also a Negro Woman; yet they gave me liberty to put on my Clothes, keeping me bound with a Cord on one arm, till I put on my Cloths to the other; and then changing my Cord, they let me dress my self, and then Pinioned me again. Gave liberty to my dear Wife to dress herself, &amp; our Children. About Sun an hour high, we were all carryed out of the
<PB N="5" REF="001340_0011_0FB2822981BD30C0"/>
house, for a March, and saw many of the Houses of my Neighbours in Flames, perceiving the whole Fort, one house excepted, to be taken. Who can tell, what Sorrows pierced our Souls, when we saw our selves carryed away from Gods Sanctuary, to go into a strange Land, exposed to so many Trials? the journey being at least Three hundred Miles we were to Travel; the Snow up to the Knees, and we never inur'd to such hardships and fatigues▪ the place we were to be carryed to, a Popish Coun∣try. Upon my parting from the Town they fired my House &amp; Barn. We were carryed over the River, to the foot of the <HI>Mountain,</HI> about a Mile from my House, where we found, a great number of our Christian Neighbours, Men, Women &amp; Chil∣dren, to the number of an hundred, Nineteen of which were afterward Murdered by the Way, and Two starved to Death, near <HI>Cowass,</HI> in a time of great Scarcity or Famine, the Salvages underwent there. When we came to the foot of our Mountain, they took away our Shoes, and gave us, in the room of them Indian-Shoes, to prepare us for our Travel. Whilst we were there the English beat out a Com∣pany, that remained in the Town, and pursued them to the River, Killing and Wounding many of them; but the body of the Army, being Alarm'd, they repulsed those few <HI>English</HI> that pursued them.</P>
<P>I am not able to give you an account of the num∣ber of the Enemy Slain, but I observed after this fight, no great insulting Mirth, as I expected; and saw many Wounded Persons, and for several days together they buryed of their party, &amp; one of chief
<PB N="6" REF="001340_0012_0FB2822B42F61E20"/>
Note among the <HI>Macqua's.</HI> The Governour of <HI>Ca∣nada,</HI> told me, his Army had that Success with the loss but of Eleven men, Three French-men, One of which was the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> of the Army, Five <HI>Mac∣qua's,</HI> and Three <HI>Indians:</HI> but after my Arrival at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> I spake with an English man, who was ta∣ken the last War, and Married there, and of their Re∣ligion; who told me, they lost above Forty, and that many were Wounded: I replyed the Gover∣nour of <HI>Canada</HI> said, they lost but Eleven men: He answered, 'tis true, That there were but Eleven kill∣ed out-right at the taking of the Fort, but that many others were Wounded, among whom was the <HI>Ensign</HI> of the <HI>French;</HI> but said he, they had a fight in the Meadow, and that in both Engagements, they lost more than Forty. Some of the Souldiers, both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> then present told me so (said he) add∣ing, That the French always endeavour, to con∣ceal the number of their Slain.</P>
<P>After this, we went up the Mountain, and saw the smoak of the Fires in the Town, and beheld the awful desolations of our Town: And before we marched any farther, they kill'd a Sucking Child of the English. There were slain by the Enemy of the Inhabitants of our Town to the number of Thir∣ty-eight, besides Nine of the Neighbouring Towns▪ We Travel'd not far the first day; God made the Heathen, so to Pity our Children, that though they had several Wounded Persons, of their own to carry, upon their Shoulders, for Thirty Miles, before they came to the River, yet they carryed our Chil∣dren, uncapable of Travelling, upon their Shoulders,
<PB N="7" REF="001340_0013_0FB28235B0550FE8"/>
and in their Arms. When we came to our Lodg∣ing place, the first Night, they dugg away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>now, and made some Wigwams, cut down some of the small branches of <HI>Spruce-trees</HI> to lye down on, and gave the Prisoners some-what to eat; but we had but little Appetite. I was Pinioned, and bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own that Night, and so I was every Night whilst I was with the Army. Some of the Enemy who brought drink with them, from the Town, fell to Drinking, and in their Drunken fit, they kill'd my Negro man, the only dead Person, I either saw at the Town, or in the Way. In the Night an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Man made his escape: in the Morning I was call'd for, and ordered by the General to tell the English, That if any more made their escape, they would burn the rest of the Prisoners. He that took me was unwilling to let me speak with any of the Prisoners, as we March'd; but on the Morning of the Second day, he being appointed to guard the Rear, I was put into the hands of my other Master, Who permitted me to speak to my Wife, when I overtook her, and to Walk with her to help her in her Journey. On the Way we discoursed of the happiness of them who had a right to <HI>an House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens;</HI> and <HI>God for a Father, and Friend;</HI> as also, That it was our rea∣sonable Duty, quietly to submit, to the Will of God, and to say, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> My Wife told me her strength of body began to fail, &amp; that I must expect to part with her; Saying, She hoped God would preserve my Life, and the Life of some, if not of all of our Children, with us; and
<PB N="8" REF="001340_0014_0FB2823705E94A58"/>
commended to me, under God, the care of them She never spake any discontented Word as to what had befal'n us, but with suitable expressions justify∣ed God, in what had befal'n us. We soon made an halt, in which time my chief Surviving Master came up, upon which I was put upon Marching with the foremost, and so made to take my last fare-well of my dear Wife, <HI>the desire of my Eyes,</HI> and companion in many Mercies and Afflictions. Upon our Sepa∣ration from each other, we askt for each other, Grace sufficient, for what God should call us to: After our being parted from one another, she spent the few remaining Minutes of her stay, in Reading the Holy Scriptures; which she was wont Personal∣ly every day to delight her Soul in Reading, Pray∣ing, Meditating of, and over, by her self, in her Closet, over and above what she heard out of them in our Family Worship. I was made to Wade over a small River, and so were all the English, the Wa∣ter above Knee-deep, the Stream very Swift; and after that, to Travel up a small Mountain, my Strength was almost spent, before I came to the top of it: No sooner had I overcome the difficulty of that ascent, but I was permitted to sit down, &amp; be unburthened of my Pack; I sat pitying those who were behind, and intreated my Master, to let me go down, and help up my Wife, but he refused, and would not le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me stir from him. I ask'd each of the Prisoner (as they passed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) after her, and heard that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passing through the abovesaid River, she fell down and was plunged over Head and Ears in the Water after which she travelled not far, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or at the Foot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="9" REF="001340_0015_0FB28238C462A670"/>
this Mountain, the cruel and blood thirsty Salvage who took her, slew her with his Hatchet, at one stroak; the tidings of which were very awful: and y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t such was the hard-heartedness of the Adversary, that my Tears were reckoned to me as a reproach. My loss, and the loss of my Children was great, our hearts were so filled with Sorrow, that nothing but the comfortable hopes of her being taken away in Mercy, to her self, from the evils we were to see, feel and suffer under; (and joyn'd to the Assembly of the <HI>Spirits of just men made perfect,</HI> to rest in Peace, and <HI>joy unspeakable, and full of glory;</HI> and the good pleasure of God thus to exercise us,) could have kept us from sinking under, at that time. That Scrip∣ture, <HI>Job</HI> 1. 21.—<HI>Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and Naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord:</HI> Was brought to my Mind, and from it, That an <HI>Afflicting God was to be Glorifyed;</HI> with some other places of Scripture, to perswade to a Patient bear∣ing my Afflictions.</P>
<P>We were again call'd upon to March, with a far heavier <HI>Burden on my Spirits,</HI> than on my <HI>Back,</HI> I beg'd of God, to Over-rule in His Providence, that the Corpse of One so dear to me, and of one whose Spi∣rit, He had taken to dwell with Him in Glory, might meet with a Christian burial, and not be left for Meat, to the Fowls of the Air, and Beasts of the Earth: A Mercy that God graciously vouchsafed to grant. For God put it into the hearts of my Neigh∣bours, to come out as far as she lay, to take up her Corpse, recarry it to the Town, and decently to
<PB N="10" REF="001340_0016_0FB283CB453D2BD8"/>
bury it, soon after. In our March they killed a∣nother Sucking Infant of one of my Neighbours; and before Night, a Girl of about Eleven years of Age. I was made to Mourn, at the Consideration of my Flocks being so far a Flock of Slaughter, ma∣ny being Slain in the Town, and so many Murdered in so few Miles from the Town; and from fears what we must yet expect, from such who delight∣fully imbrued their hands in the blood of so many of His People. When we came to our lodging Place, an Indian Captain from the <HI>Eastward</HI> spake to my Master about killing of me, and taking off my Scalp. I lift up my heart to God, to implore His Grace, and Mercy in such a time of need; and afterwards I told my Master, if he intended to kill me, I desired he would let me know of it, assuring him that my Death after a promise of Quarter would bring the guilt of blood upon him. He told me he would not kill me: We laid down and Slept for God Sustained and kept us. In the Morning we were all called before the chief <HI>Sachems</HI> of the <HI>Mac∣qua's,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> that a more equal distribution might be made of the Prisoners, among them: at my going from the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> my best Clothing was taken away from me. As I came nigh the Place appoint∣ed, some of the Captives met me, and told me, they thought the Enemies were going to burn some of us, for they had peeled off the bark from several Trees, and acted very strangely. To whom I replyed, They could act nothing against us, but as they were per∣mitted of God, and I was perswaded, He would pre∣vent such Severities. When we came to the <HI>Wigwam</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001340_0017_0FB283CCC215F368"/>
appointed, several of the Captives were taken from their former Masters, and put into the hands of o∣thers: but I was sent again to my two Masters, who brought me from my House.</P>
<P>In our fourth days March the Enemy killed ano∣ther of my Neighbours, who being nigh the time of Travail, was wearied with her Journey. When we came to the great River, the Enemy took <HI>Slayes</HI> to draw their Wounded, several of our Children, and their Packs; and Marched a great pace. I Tra∣velled many hours in Water up to the ankles: near Night I was very Lame, having before my Travel wrong'd my anckle-bone and sinews: I thought, so did others, that I should not be able to hold out to Travel far. I lift up my Heart to God (my only refuge) to remove my Lameness, and carry me through with my Children and Neighbours, if He judg'd it best; however I desired God would be with me in my great Change, if He call'd me by such a Death to Glorify Him: and that He would take care of my Children, and Neighbours, and bless them; and within a little space of time, I was well of my Lameness, to the joy of my Children, and Neigh∣bours, that saw so great an alteration in my Tra∣velling.</P>
<P>On the Saturday, the Journey was long and tedious; we travelled with such speed, that four Women were tired, and then Slain by them who led them Captive.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Sabbath Day</HI> we rested, and I was permit∣ted to Pray and Preach to the Captives. The place of Scripture spoken from, was <HI>Lam.</HI> 1. 18. <HI>The Lord
<PB N="12" REF="001340_0018_0FB283CFF565C00"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, I pray you, all people, and behold my Sorrow: my virgins and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men are gone into captivity.</HI> The Enemy who said to us, <HI>Sing us one of Zions Songs;</HI> were ready some of them, to upbraid us, because our Singing was not so loud as theirs. When the <HI>Macqua's</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were chief in power, we had this revival in our bondage; to joyn together in the Worship of God, and encourage one another to a Patient <HI>bearing the Indignation of the Lord, till he should plead our cause.</HI> When we arrived to <HI>New France</HI> we were forbiden Praying one with another, or joyning together in the Service of God.</P>
<P>The next day, soon after we Marched, we had an Alarm; on which many of the <HI>English</HI> were bound: I was then near the Front, and my Masters not with me; so I was not bound. This Alarm was occasioned by some <HI>Indians</HI> shooting at <HI>Geese</HI> that flew over them, that put them into a considerable consternation, and fright: but after they came to understand they were not pursued by the <HI>English,</HI> they boasted, That the <HI>English</HI> would not come out after them, as they had boasted before, we began our Journey in the Morning. They kill'd this day Two Women, who were so faint they could not Travel.</P>
<P>The next day in the Morning, before we Tra∣velled, one <HI>Mary Brooks,</HI> a pious Young Woman, came to the <HI>Wigwam</HI> where I was, and told me She desired to bless God, who had inclined the heart of her Master, to let her come to take her farewell to me. Said she, by my falls on the Ice yesterday I

wrong'd my self, causing an Abortion this Night, so that I am not able to Travel far; I know they will kill me to day: but (sayes she) God has (Prai∣sed be His Name) by His Spirit with His Word, strengthened me to my last encounter with Death: and mentioned to me some places of <HI>Scripture</HI> so sea∣sonably sent in for her support. And (says she) <HI>I am not afraid of Death,</HI> I can through the Grace of God, chearfully submit to the Will of God. Pray for me (said she) at parting, That God would take me to Himself. Accordingly she was killed that day. I mention it to the end, I may stir up all in their Young Days, to improve the Death of CHRIST by Faith, to a giving them an holy boldness in the day of Death.</P>
<P>The next day we were made to Scatter one from another into smaller Companies; and one of my Children carryed away with <HI>Indians,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Eastern</HI> parts. At Night my Master came to me, with my Pistol in his hand, and put it to my breast, and said, Now I will kill you, for (said he) at your House you would have killed me with it if you could. But by the Grace of God, I was not much daunted, and whatever his intention might be; God prevented my Death.</P>
<P>The next day, I was again permitted to <HI>Pray</HI> with that Company of Captives with me, and we allowed to <HI>Sing a Psalm</HI> together. After which, I was taken from all the Company of the <HI>English,</HI> ex∣cepting two Children of my Neighbours, one of which a Girl of four years of Age, was kill'd by her <HI>Maqua</HI> Master, the next Morning, the Snow be∣ing

so deep, when we left the River, that he could not carry the Child and his Pack too.</P>
<P>When the Sabbath came, one <HI>Indian</HI> staid with me, and a little Boy Nine years old, whilst the rest went a hunting. And when I was here, I thought with my self, that God had now separated me from the Congregation of His People, who were <HI>now</HI> in His <HI>Sanctuary</HI> where He Commandeth the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssing, e∣ven Life for ever:</HI> And made to bewail my <HI>Unfruit∣fulness</HI> under, and <HI>Unthankfulness</HI> for such a Mercy. When my Spirit was almost over-whelmed within me at the consideration of what had passed over me, and what was to be expected; I was ready almost to Sink in my Spirit. But God spake those Words with a greater efficacy then man could speak them, for my strengthning and support: <HI>Psal.</HI> 118. 17. <HI>I shall not dye, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.</HI> Psal. 42. 11. <HI>Why art thou cast down, O my Soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my counte∣nance, and my God.</HI> Nehem. 1. 8, 9. <HI>Remember I be∣seech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy Servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the Nations: But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to set my Name there.</HI> Those Three places of Scripture, one after another by the <HI>Grace of God,</HI> strengthened my <HI>Hopes,</HI> that God would so far restrain the Wrath of the Adversary, that the greatest number of us left alive, should be carried
<PB N="15" REF="001340_0021_0FB283D6130C9E10"/>
through so tedious a Journey. That tho' my Chil∣dren had no Father to take care of them, that Word quieted me to a patient waiting to see the end the Lord would make, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 19. 11. <HI>Leave thy fatherless Children, I will preserve them al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve, and let thy Widows trust in me.</HI> Accordingly God carryed them Won∣derfully through great Difficulties and Dangers. My youngest Daughter, Aged <HI>Seven</HI> years, was carryed all the Journey, &amp; look'd after with a great deal of Tenderness. My youngest Son, Aged <HI>Four</HI> years, was Wonderfully preserved from Death; for though they that carryed him, or draw'd him on <HI>Sleyes,</HI> were tired with their Journeys, yet their Sal∣vage cruel Tempers, were so over-ruled by God, that they did not kill him, but in their pity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he was spared, and others would take care of him; so that four times on the Journey he was spared, and others would take care of him, till at last he arrived at <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> where a <HI>French</HI> Gentlewoman pitying the Child, redeemed it out of the hands of the Hea∣then. My Son <HI>Samuel,</HI> and my Eldest Daughter were pityed, so as to be drawn on <HI>Sleyes,</HI> when un∣able to Travel. And tho' they suffered very much through Scarcity of Food, and tedious Journeys, they were carryed through to <HI>Mont-Royal.</HI> And my Son <HI>Stephen</HI> about <HI>Eleven</HI> years of Age, Wonderfully preserved from Death, in the Famine whereof three <HI>English</HI> Persons dyed, and after Eight Months brought into <HI>Shamblee.</HI></P>
<P>My Master returned on the Evening of the <HI>Sab∣bath,</HI> and told me, <HI>he had killed five Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</HI> The next day we removed to the place where he killed them.
<PB N="16" REF="001340_0022_0FB283D967092DE8"/>
We tarryed there three days, till we had rosted and dryed the Meat. My Master made me a pair of <HI>Snow-shoes,</HI> for (said he) <HI>You cannot possibly Travel without;</HI> the <HI>Snow</HI> being knee-deep. We parted from thence heavy laden; I Travelled with a bur∣den on my back, with <HI>Snow-shoes Twenty-five</HI> Miles the first day of wearing them; and again the next day till afternoon; and then we came to the <HI>French River.</HI> My Master at this place took away my pack, and draw'd the whole load on the Ice: but my bones seemed to be misplaced, and I unable to Tra∣vel with any speed. My feet were very sore, and each Night I wrung <HI>Blood</HI> out of my <HI>Stockings,</HI> when I pulled them off. My <HI>Shins</HI> also were very sore, being cut with <HI>Crusty Snow,</HI> in the time of my Tra∣velling without <HI>Snow-shoes.</HI> But finding some dry <HI>Oak-leaves,</HI> by the River banks, I put them to my <HI>Shins,</HI> and in once applying of them, they were healed. And here my Master was very kind to me, would alwayes give me the best he had to Eat; and by the goodness of God, I never wanted a <HI>Meals Meat,</HI> during my Captivity; tho' some of my Chil∣dren and Neighbours, were greatly Wounded, (as I may say) with the Arrows of <HI>Famine,</HI> and <HI>Pinching want;</HI> having for many dayes nothing but <HI>Roots</HI> to live upon, and not much of them neither. My Master gave me a piece of a BIBLE; never distur∣bed me in Reading the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> or in <HI>Praying</HI> to God. Many of my Neighbours also, found that Mercy in their Journey, to have <HI>Bibles, Psalm-books, Catechisms,</HI> and <HI>Good Books,</HI> put into their hands, with liberty to use them; and yet after their Arrival at
<PB N="17" REF="001340_0023_0FB283DC7880FB28"/>
<HI>Canada,</HI> all possible endeavours were used, to deprive them of them. Some of them say, their <HI>Bibles</HI> were demanded by the <HI>French Priests,</HI> and never re-deli∣vered to them, to their great grief and sorrow.</P>
<P>My March on the <HI>French River</HI> was very sore, for fearing a <HI>Thaw,</HI> we Travelled a very great pace; my Feet were so bruised, and my joynts so distor∣ted by my Travelling in <HI>Snow-shoes,</HI> that I thought it unpossible to hold out. One Morning a little before break of day, my Master came &amp; awaken'd me out of my Sleep, Saying, <HI>Arise, Pray to God, and Eat your Breakfast, for we must go a great way to day.</HI> After Prayer, I arose from my knees, but my feet were so <HI>Tender, Swoln, Bruised,</HI> and full of <HI>Pain,</HI> that I could scarce stand upon them, without holding on the <HI>Wigwam.</HI> And when the <HI>Indians</HI> said, <HI>You must run to day;</HI> I answered, I could not run: My Mas∣ter pointing out to his Hatchet, said to me, <HI>Then I must dash out your Brains, and take off your Scalp.</HI> I said I suppose then you will do so, for I am not able to Travel with speed. He sent me away alone, on the Ice. About Sun half an hour high, he over∣took me, for I had gone very slowly, not thinking it possible to Travel Five Miles. When he came up he called me to <HI>Run;</HI> I told him I could go no faster; he passed by without saying one Word more: So that sometimes I scarce saw any thing of him for an hour together. I Travel'd from about break of day, till dark, never so much as set down at noon to Eat Warm Victuals; Eating frozen Meat, which I had in my Coat Pocket, as I Travel'd. We went
<PB N="18" REF="001340_0024_0FB283DD49D00620"/>
that day <HI>Two</HI> of their dayes Journey, as they came down. I judge we went Forty or Forty five Miles that day. God Wonderfully supported me, and so far renewed my Strength, that in the afternoon I was Stronger to Travel than in the forenoon. My Strength was restored and renewed to admiration. We should never distrust the care and compassion of God, who can give <HI>Strength to them who have no might, and power to them who are ready to faint.</HI></P>
<P>When we entred on the Lake the Ice, was very rough, and uneven, which was very grievous to my feet, that could scarce endure to be set down on the Smooth Ice, on the River; I lift up my cry to God in Ejaculatory requests, <HI>That He would take no∣tice of my State, and some way or other relieve me.</HI> I had not Marched above half a Mile, before there fell a <HI>Moist Snow,</HI> about an inch and half deep, that made it very soft for my feet, to pass over the Lake, to the place where my Masters Family was. Won∣derful favours in the midst of trying Afflictions! We went a days Journey from the Lake, to a small Company of <HI>Indians,</HI> who were a hunting; they were after their manner kind to me, and gave me the best they had, which was <HI>Moose-flesh, Ground-nuts</HI> and <HI>Cramberrys,</HI> but no Bread: For Three Weeks to∣gether I eat no Bread. After our stay there, and undergoing difficulties in <HI>Cutting of Wood,</HI> and suffe∣ring from <HI>Louziness,</HI> having <HI>Louzy</HI> old Clothes of Souldiers, put upon me, when they stript me of mine, to Sell to the <HI>French</HI> Souldiers in the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="001340_0025_0FB283DFC40B1C48"/>
We again began a March for <HI>Shamblee,</HI> we stay'd at a branch of the Lake, and feasted Two or Three days on <HI>Geese</HI> we killed there. After another days Travel, we came to a River where the Ice was thaw'd, we made a <HI>Cannoe</HI> of <HI>Elm-bark,</HI> in one day; and ar∣rived on a Saturday near noon at <HI>Shamblee,</HI> a small Village, where is a Garison, &amp; Fort of <HI>French</HI> Souldi∣ers. This Village is about Fifteen Miles from <HI>Mont-Royal.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were very kind to me: A Gen∣tleman of the Place, took me into his House, and to his Table; and lodged me at Night on a good <HI>Fea∣ther-bed.</HI> The Inhabitants, and Officers were very obliging to me, the little time I stay'd with them, and promised to Write a Letter to the Governour in Chief, to inform him of my passing down the River. Here I saw a Girl taken from our <HI>Town,</HI> and a young Man, who informed me, that the greatest part of the <HI>Captives</HI> were come in, and that <HI>Two</HI> of my Children were at <HI>Mont-Royal;</HI> that many of the Captives had been in, <HI>Three Weeks</HI> before my arrival: Mercy in the midst of Judgment! As we passed along the River towards <HI>Sorel,</HI> we went into an House where was an <HI>English Woman</HI> of our <HI>Town,</HI> who had been left among the <HI>French</HI> in order to her Conveyance to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fort. The <HI>French</HI> were very kind to her, and to my self, and gave us the best Provision they had; and she Embarkqued with us to go down to St. <HI>Fran∣cois</HI> Fort. When we came down to the first Inhabi∣ted House at <HI>Sorel,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Woman came to the Ri∣ver side, and desired us to go into her House, and when we were entred, She compassioned our State, and told us, <HI>She had in the last War been a Captive a∣mong</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001340_0026_0FB283E1069983A0"/>
<HI>the Indians, and therefore was not a little sensible of our difficulties.</HI> She gave the <HI>Indians</HI> something to eat in the <HI>Chimny corner,</HI> and spread a cloth on the <HI>Table</HI> for us with <HI>Napkins;</HI> Which gave such offence to the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they hasted away, and would not call in at the Fort. But where▪ ever we entred into Houses, the <HI>French</HI> were very Courteous. When we came to St. <HI>Francois</HI> River, we found some difficulty by reason of the Ice; and entring into a French∣mans House, he gave us a loaf of Bread, and some Fish to carry away with us; but we passed down the River till Night, and there Seven of us Supped on the Fish▪ called <HI>Bull-be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> or <HI>Pout,</HI> and did not eat it up, the Fish was so very large.</P>
<P>The next Morning we met with such a great quantity of Ice, that we were forced to leave our <HI>Cannoe,</HI> and Travel on Land. We went to a <HI>French</HI> Officers house, who took us into a private Room, out of the sight of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and treated us very Courteously. That Night we arrived at the Fort call'd St. <HI>Francois;</HI> Where we found several poor Children who had been taken from the <HI>Eastward,</HI> the Summer before, a sight very Affecting, they be∣ing in habit very much like <HI>Indians,</HI> and in Manners very much Symbolizing with them. At this Fort lived two <HI>Jesuits</HI> one of which was made Superiour of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> at <HI>Quebeck.</HI> One of these <HI>Jesuits</HI> met me at the Fort Gate, and asked me to go into the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Give God Thanks for preserving my Life,</HI> I told him I would do that in some other Place. When the Bell rang for Evening Prayers, he that took me, <HI>Bid me go;</HI> but I refused: The <HI>Jesuit</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="001340_0027_0FB283E2908CBD78"/>
came to our <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and Prayed a short Prayer; and invited me to Sup with them; and justifyed the <HI>Indians</HI> in what they did against us: Rehearsing some things done by <HI>Major Walden,</HI> above Thirty years ago; and how justly God retaliated them in the last War, and inveighed against us for beginning this War with the <HI>Indians.</HI> And said, <HI>We had before the last Winter, and in the Winter been very Barbarous, and Cruel in burning and killing Indians.</HI> I told them, That the <HI>Indians</HI> in a very Persidious manner, had committed <HI>Murders</HI> on many of our Inhabitants, after the Signing <HI>Articles of Peace:</HI> and as to what they spake of <HI>Cruelties,</HI> they were undoubtedly <HI>Falsehoods,</HI> for I well knew, the <HI>English</HI> were not approvers of any inhumanity, or barbarity towards Enemies. They said, <HI>An English man had killed one of</HI> St Casteen's <HI>Relations, which occasioned this War:</HI> for, say they, <HI>The Nations in a general Counsel, had concluded not to engage in the War, on any side, till they themselves were first molested, and then all of them as one, would engage against them that began a War with them; and that upon the killing of</HI> Casteens <HI>Kindsman, a Post was dispatched to</HI> Canada, <HI>to advertise the</HI> Maqua's, <HI>and</HI> Indians, <HI>that the</HI> English <HI>had begun a War. On which they gathered up their Forces, and that the</HI> French <HI>joyned with them, to come down on the</HI> Eastern Parts; <HI>and that when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> near</HI> New-England, <HI>several of the</HI> Eastern Indi∣ans, <HI>told them of the Peace made with the</HI> English, <HI>and the satisfaction given them from the</HI> English <HI>for that Mur∣der.

with the</HI> English.

<P>The next Morning the <HI>Bell Rang</HI> for <HI>Mass:</HI> My Master <HI>bid me go to Church:</HI> I refused: he threatned me, and went away in a rage. At Noon the <HI>Jesuits</HI> sent for me, to dine with them; for I eat at their Table all the time I was at the Fort. And after Din∣ner, they told me, <HI>the Indians would not allow of any of their Captives staying in their Wigwams, whilst they were at Church; and were resolved by force and violence to bring us all to Church, if we would not go without.</HI> I told them it was highly unreasonable so to impose upon those who were of a contrary Religion; and to force us to be present at such Service, as we <HI>Ab∣hor'd,</HI> was nothing becoming Christianity. They re∣plyed, <HI>They were Salvages, and would not hearken to rea∣son, but would have their Wills:</HI> Said also, <HI>If they were in</HI> New-England <HI>themselves, they would go into their Churches to see their Wayes of Worship.</HI> I answered, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> case was far different, for there was nothing (them∣selves being judges) as to matter or manner of <HI>Wor∣ship,</HI> but what was according to the Word of God, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Churches; and therefore it could not be an of fence to any mans Conscience. But among them there were <HI>Idolatrous Superstitions</HI> in <HI>Worship:</HI> they
<PB N="23" REF="001340_0029_0FB283E6796F52C8"/>
said, <HI>Come and see, and offer us Conviction, of what is Superstitious in Worship.</HI> To which I answered, <HI>That I was not to do Evil that Good might come on it;</HI> and that forcing in matters of Religion was hateful. They answered, <HI>The Indians were resolved to have it so, &amp; they could not pacify them without my coming; and they would engage they should offer no force or violence to cause any compliance with their Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P>The next Mass, my Master bid me go to <HI>Church:</HI> I objected; he arose and forcibly pulled me out by Head and Shoulders out of the <HI>Wigwam</HI> to the <HI>Church,</HI> that was nigh the doo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> So I went in and sat down behind the door, and there saw a great confusion, instead of any <HI>Gospel Order.</HI> For one of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> was at the Altar, saying <HI>Mass</HI> in a Tongue <HI>Unknown</HI> to the Salvages, and the other, between the Altar &amp; the door, saying and singing <HI>Prayers</HI> among the <HI>In∣dians</HI> at the same time; and many others were at the same time saying over their <HI>Pater Nosters,</HI> and <HI>Ave Mary,</HI> by tale from their <HI>Chapelit,</HI> or <HI>Beads</HI> on a String. At our going out we smiled at their Devo∣tion so managed; which was offensive to them: for they said, <HI>We made a Derision of their Worship.</HI> When I was here, a certain Salvagess dyed; one of the <HI>Je∣suits</HI> told me, <HI>She was a very holy Woman, who had not committed One Sin in Twelve years.</HI> After a day or two the <HI>Jesuits</HI> ask'd me, <HI>What I thought of their Way, now I saw it?</HI> I told them, I thought Christ said of it, as <HI>Mark.</HI> 7. 7, 8, 9. <HI>Howbeit, in vain do they Worship me, teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men. For laying aside the Commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots, and cups: and many other
<PB N="24" REF="001340_0030_0FB283E894A3CC58"/>
such like things ye do. And he said unto them, Full we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own tradition.</HI> They told me, <HI>They were not the Com∣mandments of men,</HI> but <HI>Apostolical Traditions,</HI> of equal authority with the Holy Scriptures. And that after my Death, I would bewail my not Praying to the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and that I should find the want of her Intercession for me, <HI>with her Son;</HI> judging me to Hell for asserting, the Scriptures to be a perfect rule of Faith: and said, I abounded in my own sense, en∣tertaining explications contrary to the sense of the <HI>Pope,</HI> regularly sitting with a general Council, ex∣plaining Scripture, and making Articles of Faith. I told them, It was my Comfort that Christ was to be my <HI>Judge,</HI> and not they at the <HI>Great Day:</HI> And as for their censuring and judging of me, I was not moved with it. One day a certain Salvages<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken Prisoner in <HI>Philips</HI> War, who had lived at Mr. <HI>Buckleys</HI> at <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> called <HI>Ruth,</HI> who could speak <HI>English</HI> very well; who had been often at my House, but was now proselyted to the <HI>Romish Faith,</HI> came into the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and with her an <HI>English</HI> Maid, who was taken the last War, who was dress'd up in <HI>Indian</HI> Apparel, could not speak one word of <HI>English,</HI> who said she could neither tell her own name, or the name of the place from whence sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was taken.

<PB N="25" REF="001340_0031_0FB283EE1CA7DC78"/>
for you know the Scripture saith, <HI>Servants obey your Masters;</HI> he is your Master, and you his Servant. I told her she was ignorant, and knew not the mea∣ning of the Scripture, telling her, <HI>I was not to diso∣bey the Great God to obey any Master, and that I was rea∣dy to suffer for God if called thereto:</HI> On which she talked to my Master, I suppose she interpreted what I said. My Master took hold of my hand to force me to <HI>Cross my self,</HI> but I strugled with him, and would not suffer him to guide my hand, upon this he pulled off a <HI>Crucifix</HI> from his own neck, and bad me <HI>Kiss</HI> it; but I refused once and again; he told me <HI>be would dash out my brains with his Hatchet if I refused.</HI> I told him I should sooner chuse death then to Sin against God; then he ran and catcht up his Hatchet, and acted as tho' he would have dashed out my Brains; seeing I was not moved, he threw down his Hatchet, saying, <HI>he would first bite off all my nails if I still refused;</HI> I gave him my hand and told him, I was ready to suffer, he set his teeth in my thumb nails and gave a gripe with his teeth, and then said, <HI>no good Minister, no love God, as bad as the Devil;</HI> and so left off. I have reason to bless God who streng∣thened me to withstand; by this he was so discou∣raged as never more to meddle with me about my Religion. I askt leave of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> to Pray with those <HI>English</HI> of our Town that were with me, but they absolutely refused to give us any permission to pray one with another, and did what they could to prevent our having any discourse together.</P>
<P>After a few days the Governour <HI>de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>audrel,</HI> Go∣vernour in Chief, sent down two men with Letters
<PB N="26" REF="001340_0032_0FB283F1A8559790"/>
to the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> desiring them to order my being sent up to him to <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> upon which one of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> went with my two Masters, and took me a∣long with them, as also two more of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> a man and his Daughter about <HI>Seven</HI> years of Age. When we came to the Lake, the Wind was tempestuous &amp; contrary to us, so that they were afraid to go over; they Landed and kindled a fire, &amp; said they would wait a while to see whether the Wind would fall or change. I went a side from the Company among the Trees, and spread our case with the temptations of it before God, and pleaded that He would order the season so, that we might not go back again, but be furthered on our Voyage, that I might have op∣portunity to see my Children and Neighbours, and converse with them, and know their state. When I returned, the Wind was more boisterous, and then a second time, and the Wind was more fierce; I re∣flected upon my self for my unquietness, and the want of a resigned will to the Will of God. And a third time went &amp; bewailed before God my anxious cares, and the tumultuous workings of my own heart, begg'd a Will fully resigned to the Will of God, and thought that by the Grace of God I was brought to say <HI>Amen,</HI> to whatever God should de∣termine, Upon my return to the Company, the Wind was yet high; the Jesuit and my Master said, come we will go back again to the Fort, for there is no likelihood of proceeding in our Voyage, for very frequently such a Wind continues three days, sometimes fix; after it continued so many hours, I said to them, <HI>the Will of the Lord be done;</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="001340_0033_0FB283F30969DDC8"/>
and the Cannoe was put again into the River, and we embarqued. No sooner had my Master put me into the Cannoe, and put off from the Shoar, but the Wind fell, and coming into the middle of the River, they said, <HI>We may go over the Lake well enough:</HI> and so we did. I promised, if God gave me Opportunity I would stir up others to Glorify God in a continu∣ed persevering, committing their straights of heart to Him; <HI>He is a Prayer bearing God, and the Stormy Winds obey Him.</HI> After we passed over the Lake, the <HI>French</HI> where ever we came were very compassionate to us.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> which was Eight Weeks after my Captivity; the Governour <HI>de' Vau∣drel</HI> redeemed me out of the hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> gave me good Clothing, took me to his Table, gave me the use of a very good Chamber; and was in all respects relating to my outward man, courteous and chari∣table to admiration. At my first entring into his House, he sent for my two Children, who were in the City, that I might see them; and promised to do what he could to get all my Children &amp; Neigh∣bours out of the hands of the Salvages. My change of Dyet after the difficulties of my Journey's, caused an alteration in my Body: I was <HI>Physick'd, Blooded,</HI> and very tenderly taken care of in my Sickness The Governour redeemed my Eldest Daughter out of the hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and she was carefully tended in the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spital,</HI> until she was well of her Lameness; &amp; by the Governour provided for with respect, during her stay in the Country. My youngest Child was redeemed by a Gentlewoman in the City
<PB N="28" REF="001340_0034_0FB283F595E88158"/>
a the <HI>Indians</HI> passed by. After the <HI>Indians</HI> had been at their Port &amp; discoursed with the Priests, they came back and offered to the Gentlewoman a man for the Child alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging that the Child could not be profita∣ble to her, but the man would, for he was a <HI>Weaver,</HI> and his service would much advance the design she had of making cloth: but God over-ruled so far that this Temptation to the Woman prevailed not for an exchange; for had the Child gone to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fort, in an ordinary way it had abode there still, as the rest of the Children carryed thither do. The Governour gave orders to certain Officers to get the rest of my Children out of the hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and as many of my Neighbours as they could. After Six Weeks a <HI>Merchant</HI> of the City obtained my Eldest Son, that was taken to live with him: he took a great deal of pains to perswade the Salvages to part with him. An <HI>Indian</HI> came to the City (Saga∣more <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Pennacook</HI>) from <HI>Cowas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and brought word of my Son <HI>Stephen's</HI> being near <HI>Cowass,</HI> &amp; some Money was put into his hand for his Redemption, and a promise of full satisfaction if he brought him; but the Indian proved unfaithful, and I never saw my Child till a year after. The Governour order∣ed a Priest to go along with me to see my youngest Daughter among the <HI>Macqua's,</HI> and endeavour her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> with him; he was very courteous to me, and from his Parish which was near the <HI>Mac∣qua▪</HI> Fort, he wrote a Letter to the <HI>Jesuit</HI> to desire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to send my Child to see me, and to speak with them that took her, to come along with it. But the <HI>Jesuit</HI> wrote back a Letter, <HI>That I should not be permitted
<PB N="29" REF="001340_0035_0FB283F6C150FD88"/>
to speak with, or see my Child, if I came that my labour would be lost; and that the</HI> Macqua's <HI>would assoon part with their hearts, as my Child.</HI> At my return to the City, I with an heavy heart carryed the <HI>Jesuits</HI> Let∣ter to the Governour, who, when he read it, was ve∣ry angry, and endeavoured to comfort me, assuring me, <HI>I should see it, and speak with it;</HI> and he would to his utmost endeavour its ransom: Accordingly he sent to the <HI>Jesuits</HI> who were in the City, and bid them improve their interest for the obtaining the Child. After some days, he went with me in his own Person to the Fort. When we came thither, he discoursed with the <HI>Jesuits:</HI> after which my Child was brought into the <HI>Chamber</HI> where I was. I was told I might speak with her, but should be permitted to speak to no other <HI>English</HI> Person there. My Child was about Seven years old; I discoursed with her near an hour; she could Read very well, and had not forgotten her <HI>Catechism;</HI> and was very desirous to be redeemed out of the hands of the <HI>Macqua's,</HI> and bemoaned her State among them, telling me how they prophaned God's <HI>Sabbath's:</HI> and said, <HI>She thought that a few days before they had been mocking the Devil, and that one of the Jesuits stood and look'd on them.</HI> I told her, she must <HI>Pray to God</HI> for His Grace every day; She said, <HI>She did as she was able, and God heipt her:</HI> but says she, <HI>They force me to say some Prayers in</HI> Latin, <HI>but I dont understand one word of them, I hope it wont do me any harm.</HI> I told her, she must be careful she did not forget her <HI>Catechism,</HI> and the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> she had learnt by heart. She told the Captives af∣ter I was gone, as some of them have since informed
<PB N="30" REF="001340_0036_0FB283F857F4EF40"/>
me, almost every thing I spake to her; and said, <HI>She was much afraid she should forget her Catechism,</HI> hav∣ing none to instruct her. I saw her once a few days after in the City, but had not many Minutes of time with her, but what time I had, I improved to give her the best advice I could. The Governour la∣boured much for her redemption, at last he had a promise of it, in case he would procure for them an <HI>Indian</HI> Girl in her stead. Accordingly he sent up the River some hundreds of Leagues for one, but it was refused, when offered by the Governour: he offered them an hundred pieces of Eight for her Redempti∣on, but it was refused. His Lady went over to have beg'd her from them, but all in vain; its there still; and has forgotten to speak <HI>English.</HI> Oh! that all who peruse this History would joyn in their servent requests to God, <HI>with whom all things are possible,</HI> that this poor Child, and so many others of our Children who have been <HI>cast upon God from the Womb,</HI> and are now <HI>Out-cast ready to perish,</HI> might be gathered from their dispersions, and receive <HI>Sanctifying Grace</HI> from God! When I had discoursed with the Child, and was coming out of the Fort, one of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> went out of the Chamber with me, and some Souldiers, to convey me to the <HI>Cannoe.</HI> I saw some of my poor Neighbours, who stood with longing expectations to see me, and speak with me, and had leave from their Salvage Masters so to do. I was by the <HI>Jesuit</HI> him∣self thrust along by force, and permitted only to tell them some of their Relations (they askt after) were well in the City, and that with a very audible voice; being not permitted to come near to them. After
<PB N="31" REF="001340_0037_0FB283F9EE7908A0"/>
my return to the City I was very Melancholly, for I could not be permitted so much as to <HI>Pray</HI> with the <HI>English,</HI> who dwelt in the same house. And the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> who came to see me, were most of them put back by the Guard at the door, and not suffered to come &amp; speak with me. Sometimes the Guard was so strict that I could scarce go aside on necessary occasions without a repulse; and whenever I went out into the City (a favour the Governour himself never re∣fused when I ask it of him) there were spies to watch me, and to observe whether I spake to the <HI>English.</HI> Upon which I told some of the <HI>English,</HI> they must be careful to call to mind &amp; improve former Instructi∣ons, and endeavour to stand at a further distance for a while, hoping that after a short time I should have more liberty of conversing with them. But some spies sent out, found on a <HI>Sabbath Day</HI> more then <HI>Three</HI> (the number we by their order published were not to exceed together) of us in Company, who in∣formed the Priest; the next day one of the Priests told me, I had a greater number of the <HI>English</HI> with me, and that I had spoken something reflecting on their <HI>Religion.</HI> I spake to the Governour that no forcible means might be used with any of the Cap∣tives respecting their Religion; he told me, <HI>He al∣lowed no such thing.</HI> I am perswaded that the Gover∣nour if he might act as himself, would not have suf∣fered such things to be done as have been done, and that he never did know of several things acted against the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>At my first coming to <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> the Governour told me, <HI>I should be sent home assoon as Captain</HI> Battiss
<PB N="32" REF="001340_0038_0FB283FC0770F010"/>
<HI>was returned and not before; and that I was taken in or∣der to his Redemption.</HI> The Governour sought by all means to divert me from my Melancholly Sorrows, and always show'd a willingness for seeing my Chil∣dren. And one day I told him of my design of walking into the City; he pleasantly answered, <HI>Go with all my Heart.</HI> His Eldest Son went with me as far as the door &amp; saw the Guard stop me, he went in and informed his Father, who came to the door and askt, <HI>Why they affronted the Gentleman going out?</HI> They said, <HI>It was their Order:</HI> But with an angry countenance he said, <HI>His Orders were that I should not be stopt.</HI> But within a little time I had my orders to go down to <HI>Quebeck.</HI> Another thing showing that many things are done without the Governours con∣sent, tho' his Name be used to justify them, <ABBR>(<HI>viz.</HI>)</ABBR> I askt the Priest, after I had been at <HI>Mont-Royal</HI> two days, leave to go and see my youngest Child; he said, <HI>When ever you would see it tell me, and I will bring it to you;</HI> for, says he, <HI>The Governour is not willing you should go thither.</HI> And yet not many days after when we were at Dinner, the Governours Lady (seeing me sad) spake to an Officer at Table, who could speak <HI>Latin,</HI> to tell me, <HI>That after Dinner I should go along with them and see my two Children.</HI> And accordingly after Dinner I was carryed to see them; and when I came to the house I found three or four English Captives, who lived there, and I had leave to dis∣course with them. And not long after the Gover∣nours Lady askt me, to go along with her to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> one of my Neighbours Sick there.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="001340_0039_0FB283FE0E408F40"/>
One day one of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> came to the Gover∣nour, and told the Company there, <HI>That he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw such Persons as were taken from</HI> Deerfield. Said he, <HI>The</HI> Macqua's <HI>will not suffer any of their Prisoners to a∣bide in their Wigwams whilst they themselves are at M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, but carry them with them to the Church, and they cant be prevailed with to fall down on their knees to Pray there, but no sooner are they returned to their Wigwams, out they fall down on their knees to Prayer.</HI> He said, <HI>They could do nothing with the grown Persons there; and they hundred the Childrens complying.</HI> Where-upon, the <HI>Jusuits</HI> counsel'd the <HI>Macqua'</HI>s to Sell all the grown Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Fort; a stratagem to seduce poor Chil∣dren. <HI>Oh Lord! Turn the Counsels of these Ahitcphels into foolishness, and make the Counsels of the Heathen of none effect!</HI></P>
<P>Here I observed, they were wonderfully lifted up with Pride, after the return of Captain <HI>Montin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g</HI> from <HI>Northampton</HI> with News of Success: they boasted of their Success against <HI>New-England.</HI> And they sent out an Army as they said of Seven hundred men, if I mistake not, Two hundred of which were <HI>French,</HI> in company of which Army went several <HI>Jesuits;</HI> and said, <HI>They would l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e all the places on</HI> Con∣necticut <HI>River.</HI> The Superiour of the Priests told me, <HI>Their General was a very Prudent and Brave Com∣mander of undaunted Courage, and he doubted not but they should have great Success.</HI> This Army went away in such a boasting, triumphant manner, that I had great hopes God would discover and disappoint their de∣signs: our Prayers were not wanting for the Blast∣ing such a Bloody design. The Superiour of the
<PB N="34" REF="001340_0040_0FB284019F05C1D8"/>
Priests said to me, <HI>Dont flatter your selves in hopes of a short Captivity; for,</HI> said he, <HI>There are two young Princes contending for the Kingdom of</HI> Spain; <HI>and a Third, that care was to be taken for his Establishment, on the English Throne.</HI> And boasted what they would do to <HI>Europe;</HI> and that we must expect not only <HI>Europe,</HI> but in <HI>New-England</HI> the Establishment of <HI>Popery.</HI> I said, Glory not, God can make great changes in a little time, and revive His own Interest, and yet Save His poor afflicted People. Said he, <HI>The time for Miracles is past;</HI> and in the time of the last War, the <HI>King of France</HI> was as it were against all the World, and yet did very great things, but now the <HI>Kingdom of Spain</HI> is for him, and the <HI>Duke of Bavaria,</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Savey,</HI> &amp;c. and spake on a lofty manner of great things to be done by them: and having the World as I may say in subjection to them.</P>
<P>I was sent down to <HI>Quebeck</HI> in Company of Gover∣nour <HI>de Ramsey,</HI> Governour of <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> and the Superiour of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and ordered to live with one of the Council; from whom I received many favours for Seven Weeks. He told me, It was the Priests doings to send me down before the Governour came down; &amp; that if I went much to see the <HI>English,</HI> or they came much to visit me, I should yet certainly be sent away where I should have no converse with the <HI>English.</HI> After my coming down to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> I was invited to Dine with the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and to my face they were civil enough. But after a few days a young Gentleman came to my Chamber, and told me, that one of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> (after we had done Dinner) made a few Disticks of Verses &amp; gave them to his Scholars
<PB N="35" REF="001340_0041_0FB28405EDFBBA80"/>
to Translate into <HI>French:</HI> he shew'd them to me. The import of them was, 
 <Q>That the King of <HI>France</HI> his Grand-Son had sent out his Huntsmen, &amp; that they had taken a <HI>Wolf,</HI> who was shut up, and now he hopes the Sheep would be in safety.</Q>
I knew at the reading of them what he aimed at, but held my Peace, as tho' I had been ignorant of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> in∣tention. Observing this reproaching Spirit, I said in my Heart, <HI>If God will bless, let men curse if they please;</HI> and I look'd to God in CHRIST the Great Shepherd to keep his scattered Sheep among so many <HI>Romish Revenous Wolves,</HI> and to remember the reproaches where with his Holy Name, Ordinances, and Servants were daily reproached. And upon an observation of the time of these Verses being composed, I find that near the same time the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> with <HI>Twen∣ty Ecclesiasticks</HI> were taken by the <HI>English,</HI> as they were coming from <HI>France,</HI> and carried into <HI>England</HI> as Pri∣soners of War.</P>
<P>One <HI>Sabbath</HI> day Morning I observed many Signs of approaching Rain, a great moisture on the Stones of the Hearth &amp; Chimny-jams. I was that day invited to Dine with the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> and when I went up to Dinner, it began to Rain a small dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling Rain: The Superiour told me, <HI>They had been Praying for Rain that Morning: And l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> (says he) <HI>It begins to Rain.</HI> I told him, I could tell him of many instances of Gods hearing our Prayers for Rain. However in the af∣ternoon there was a general <HI>Procession</HI> of all orders, <HI>Priests, Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Fryars,</HI> and the <HI>Citizens</HI> in great Pomp, carrying (as they said) as an holy relique, one of the bones of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> The next day I was
<PB N="36" REF="001340_0042_0FB2840744E8F928"/>
invited to the Priests Seminary to Dinner; <HI>Oh,</HI> said they, <HI>we went in Procession Yesterday for Rain, and see what a Plentiful Rain followed.</HI> I answered, we had been answered when Praying for Rain, when no such Signs of Rain, and the beginnings of Rain preceeded, as now with them, before they appointed or began their Procession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> However, they upbraided me, <HI>That God did not approve of our Religion, in that He disregarded our Prayers, and accepted theirs. For</HI> (said they) <HI>We hear you had dayes of Fasting and Prayer before the Fleet came to</HI> Quebeck; <HI>God would not regard your Prayers, but heard ows, &amp; almost in a miraculous way pre∣served us when assaulted, and refused to hear your</HI> Fast-day-Prayers <HI>for your Preservation, but heard ours for your Desolation, and our Success.</HI> They boasted also of their <HI>King,</HI> and his greatness, and spake of him as tho' there could be no Settlement of the World, but as he pleased; reviling us as in a low &amp; languishing case, having no King, but being under the Government of a <HI> Queen:</HI> And spake as tho' the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would in a short time be Emperour. From this day for∣ward God gave them to hear sorrowful Tidings from <HI>Europe:</HI> That a War was commenced against the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and so their Enemies increased. Their <HI>Bishop</HI> taken, &amp; <HI>Two Millions</HI> of Wealth with him. News every year more distressing and impoverishing of them; and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> so far from being <HI>Emperour,</HI> that he is dispossess'd of his <HI>Dukedom;</HI> &amp; <HI>France</HI> so far from being strengthned by <HI>Spain</HI> that the King∣dom of <HI>Spain</HI> like to be an occasion of the Weakning and Impoverishing their own Kingdom: they them∣selves so reporting. And their great Army going
<PB N="37" REF="001340_0043_0FB2840BD1FDB298"/>
against <HI>New-England</HI> turn'd back ashamed; and they discouraged and dishearten'd, and every year very exercising fears &amp; cares, as to the <HI>Salvages</HI> who live up the River. Before the return of that Army, they told me, We were led up &amp; down and Sold by the Heathen, as Sheep for the Slanghter, and they could not devise what they should do with us, we should be so many Prisoners, when the Army returned. The <HI>Jesuit</HI> told me, It was a great Mercy that so many of our Children were brought to them, and that now especially since they were not like speedily to be re∣turned, there was hope of their being brought over to the <HI>Romish Faith.</HI> They would take the <HI>English</HI> Children born among them, and against the consent of their Parents <HI>Baptize</HI> them. One <HI>Jesuit</HI> came to me and askt, whether all the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et,</HI> (a place not far from <HI>Quebeck</HI> where the Salvages lived) were <HI>Baptized?</HI> I told him they were. He said if they be not, let me know of it, that I may Baptize them, for fear they should dye and be damn'd, if they dyed without Baptism. Says he, <HI>When the Salvages went against you, I charg'd them to Baptise all Children before they killed them: such was my desire of your E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnal Sal∣vation tho' you were our Enemies.</HI> There was a Gentle∣man called Monsier <HI>de Beauville,</HI> a Captain, the Bro∣ther of the <HI>Lord Intendant,</HI> who was a good friend to me, and very courteous to all the Captives; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent me an <HI>English</HI> Bible, and when he went to <HI>France</HI> gave it me.</P>
<P>All means were used to seduce poor Souls.</P>
<P>I was invited one day to Dine with one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Note, as I was going, met with the Superior of the
<PB N="38" REF="001340_0044_0FB2840E20340C90"/>
<HI>Jesuits</HI> coming out of the House, and he came in after dinner; and presently it was propounded to me, if I would stay among them and be of their Re∣ligion, I should have a great and honourable Pensi∣on from the <HI>King</HI> every year. The Superior of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> turned to me, and said, 
 <Q>Sir, you have ma∣nifested much grief and sorrow for your separation from so many of your Neighbours and Children; if you will now comply with this offer and propo∣sal, you may have all your Children with you; and here will be enough for an honourable main∣tainance for you and them.</Q>
I answered, <HI>Sir,</HI> If I thought your Religion to be true, I would imbrace it freely without any such offer, but so long as I believe it to be what it is, the offer of the whole World is of no more value to me than a <HI>Blackberry;</HI> and manifested such an abhorrence of this proposal, that I speedily went to take my leave and be gone. Oh! <HI>Sir</HI> (said he) <HI>set down, why in such a hurry, you are alone in your Chamber, divert your self a little longer,</HI> and fell to other discourse, and within half an hour says again: Sir, I have one thing earnestly to re∣quest of you, I pray pleasure me! I said, let your Lordship speak; (said he,) I pray come down to the Palace to morrow morning, and honour me with your Company in my <HI>Coach</HI> to the great Church, it being then a <HI>Saints</HI> day. I answered ask me any thing wherein I can serve you with a good Conscience, and I am ready to gratifie you, but I must yet ask your excuse here; and immedi∣ately went away from him. Returning unto my Chamber, I gave God thanks for his upholding o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="39" REF="001340_0045_0FB2840F89370A10"/>
me, and also made an enquiry with my self, whe∣ther I had by any action given encouragement for such a temptation. Not many days after, and a few days before Governour <HI>de' Vaudrel</HI> coming down, I was sent away Fifteen Miles down the River, that I might not have opportunity of converse with the <HI>English.</HI> I was courteously treated by the <HI>French,</HI> and the Priest of that Parish; they told me he was one of the most Learned men in the Country; he was a very ingenious man, zealous in their way, but yet very familiar. I had many disputes with the Priests who came thither, &amp; when I used their own Authors to confute some of their Positions; my Books borrowed of them were taken away from me, for they said, <HI>I made an ill use of them.</HI> They having many of them boasted of their Unity in Doctrine and Profession, were loth I should show them from their own best approved Authors, as many different Opinions, as they could charge against us. Here again, a Gentleman in the presence of the Old▪ Bi∣shop and a Priest, offered me his House, and whole Living, with assurance of <HI>Honour, Wealth</HI> and <HI>Em∣ployment,</HI> if I would imbrace their ways. I told them, I had an indignation of Soul against such offers on such terms, as parting with what was more valuable than all the World; alleadging, <HI>What is a man profited if he gain the whole World, &amp; lose his own Soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI> I was some∣times told, I might have all my Children if I would comply, and must never expect to have them on a∣ny other terms; I told them, my Children were dea∣rer to me than all the world, but I would not deny
<PB N="40" REF="001340_0046_0FB28410F95D3610"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Truths</HI> for the having of them with me; <HI>I would still put my trust in God who could perform all things for me.</HI></P>
<P>I am perswaded that the Priest of that Parish where I kept, abhorred their sending down the Heathen to commit Outrages against the <HI>English,</HI> saying, <HI>it was more like committing Murders, than managing a War.</HI> In my Confinement in this Parish, I had my undistur∣bed opportunities to be humbly imploring Grace for our selves, for Soul and Body, for His protecting presence with <HI>New-England,</HI> and His disappointing the bloody designs of Enemies; that God would be a little Sanctuary to us in a Land of Captivity, and that our Friends in <HI>New-England,</HI> might have Grace to make a more thankful and fruitful improvement of means of Grace than we had done; who by our neglects find our selves out of Gods Sanctuary.</P>
<P>On the Twenty-first of <HI>October,</HI> 1704. I received some Letters from <HI>New-England,</HI> with an account that many of our Neighbours escaped out of the de∣solations in the Fort, and that my <HI>Dear Wife</HI> was re∣carried and decently <HI>Buried.</HI> And that my Eldest Son who was absent in our desolation, was sent to <HI>Colledge</HI> and provided for; which occasioned Thanksgiving to God in the midst of Afflictions, and caused <HI>Prayers</HI> even in <HI>Canada,</HI> to be going daily up to Heaven for a Blessing upon <HI>Benefactors,</HI> showing such kindness to the desolate and afflicted. The consideration of such crafty designs to ensnare young ones, and to turn them from the <HI>Simplicity of the Gospel,</HI> to <HI>Romis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> superstition, was very exercising; sometimes they
<PB N="41" REF="001340_0047_0FB28414A8BE2148"/>
would tell me my Children, sometimes my Neigh∣bours were turned to be of their Religion. Some made it their work to allure poor Souls by flatteries and great promises, some threatned, some offered abusive carriages to such as refused to go to Church and be present at Mass; for some they industrious∣ly contrived to get them Married among them. A Priest drew up a <HI>Compendium</HI> of the <HI>Romish Catholick Faith,</HI> and pretended to prove it by the Scriptures, telling the <HI>English, that all they required was contained in the Scriptures, which they acknowledged to be the Rule of Faith and Manners;</HI> but it was by Scriptures hor∣ribly perverted and abused. I could never come to the sight of it, (tho' I often earnestly entreated a Copy of it) until I was a Shipboard for our Voy∣age for <HI>New-England;</HI> but hearing of it, I endea∣voured to possess the <HI>English</HI> with their danger of being cheated with such a pretence. I understood they would tell the <HI>English</HI> that I was turn'd, that they might gain them to change their Religion; these their endeavours to seduce to <HI>Popery</HI> were very exercising to me▪ And in my Solitariness I drew up these following Sorrowful, Mournful, Considerations, tho' unus'd to, &amp; unskilful in <HI>Poetry,</HI> yet in a plain stile for the use of some of the Captives, who would sometimes make their secret Visits to me, which at the desire of some of them, are here made publick.</P>

<P>THE Hearts of some were ready to be discou∣raged &amp; sink, saying, <HI>They were out of sight, and so out of mind.</HI> I endeavoured to perswade them, we were not forgotten, that undoubtedly many Pray∣ers were continually going up to Heaven for us. Not long after came Capt. <HI>Livingston,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Shel∣don,</HI> with Letters from His <HI>Excellency</HI> our GOVER∣NOUR, to the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> about the Exchange of Prisoners; which gave a revival to many, and raised expectations of a return. These visits from <HI>New-England</HI> to <HI>Canada</HI> so often, greatly strengthened many who were ready to faint; and gave some check to the designs of the <HI>Papists</HI> to gain Proselytes. But Gods time of deliverance was not yet come, as to some particular Persons, their Temp∣tations &amp; Tryals were increased; and some abused because they refused a compliance with their Super∣stitions. A young Woman of our Town met with a new Trial. For on a day, a <HI>French</HI> man came into the room where she was, and shewed her his <HI>Beads,</HI> &amp; boasted of them, putting them near to her; She knock'd them out of his hands on the floor; for which she was beaten, and threatned with Death, and for some dayes imprisoned. I pleaded with God His over-ruling this first Essay for the deliverance of some, as a pledge of the rest being delivered in due time. I improved Capt. <HI>de Beauville</HI> who had
<PB N="44" REF="001340_0050_0FB2841D32703B40"/>
alwayes been very friendly, to interceed with the Governour for the return of my Eldest Daughter; and for his purchasing my Son <HI>Stephen,</HI> from the <HI>In∣dians</HI> at St. <HI>Francois</HI> Fort; and for liberty to go up and see my Children and Neighbours at <HI>Mont-Roy∣al.</HI> Divine Providence appeared to a moderating my Affliction, in that <HI>Five</HI> English Persons of our Town were permitted to return with Capt. <HI>Living∣ston,</HI> among whom went my Eldest Daughter. And my Son <HI>Stephen</HI> was redeemed and sent to live with me: he was almost quite Naked, and very Poor; he had suffered much among the <HI>Indians.</HI> One of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> took upon him, to come to the <HI>Wigwam</HI> and Whip him, on some complaint that the <HI>Squaws</HI> had made, that he did not Work enough for them. As to my Petition for going up to <HI>Mont-Royal</HI> to see my Children, and Neighbours, it was denyed; as my former desire of coming up to the City before Capt. <HI>Livingstons</HI> coming was. God granted me favour as to Two of my Petitions, but yet brought me by His Grace to be willing, that He should glo∣rify. Himself in disposing of me and mine as He pleased and knew to be most for His glory: And al∣most always before any remarkable favour, I was brought to lye down at the foot of God, and made to be willing that God should govern the World, so as might be most for His own Honour, and brought to resign all to His holy Sovereignty. A frame of Spirit when wrought in me by the Grace of God, giving the greatest content and satisfaction; and very often a fore-runner of the Mercy ask'd of God, or a plain demonstration, that the not obtaining my
<PB N="45" REF="001340_0051_0FB2841E89EFDA90"/>
request was best for me. I had no small refreshing, in having one of my Children with me for four Months▪ And the <HI>English</HI> were many of them strengthned with hopes, that the treaty betwixt the Governments would issue in opening a do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of e∣scape for all.</P>
<P>In <HI>August,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> and Capt. <HI>Vetch</HI> arrived, &amp; great incouragements were given as to an Exchange of all in the Spring of the year: and some few again were sent home; among whom I obtained leave to send my Son <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>phex.</HI> Upon Mr. <HI>Dudley's</HI> and Capt. <HI>Vetch'</HI>s Petitioning, I was again permitted to go up to <HI>Quebeck;</HI> but disputing with a <HI>Mendicant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yar,</HI> who said, <HI>He was an English-man sent from</HI> France, <HI>to endeavour the Conversion of the</HI> English <HI>at</HI> Quebeck; Who arrived at <HI>Canada</HI> whilst our Gentlemen were there: I was by the Priests means ordered again to return to <HI>Chat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uvich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and no other reason given, but because I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discoursed with that Priest, and their fear I should prevent his success amongst the Cap∣tives. But God shew'd His dislike of such a Perse∣cuting Spirit: for the very next day which was <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 20 <HI>O. S. October</HI> 1st <HI>N. S.</HI> the <HI>Seminary,</HI> a very famous building, was most of it burnt down; occa∣sioned by a Joyners letting a Coal of fire drop down among the Shavings. The <HI>Chappel</HI> in the <HI>Priests</HI> Gar∣den, and the <HI>Great Cross</HI> were burnt down; the <HI>Li∣brary</HI> of the Priests burnt up: This <HI>Seminary</HI> and a∣nother <HI>Library</HI> had been burnt but about Three years before. The day after my being sent away by the Priests means from <HI>Quebeck</HI> at first, there was a Thun∣der-Storm, and the Lightning struck the <HI>Seminary</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="001340_0052_0FB28420E2837300"/>
in the very place where the fire now began.</P>
<P>A little before Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s arrival, came a Souldi∣er into my Land-lords house <HI>Bure-foot,</HI> and <HI>Bare∣leg'd,</HI> going on a Pilgrimage to <HI>Saint Anne.</HI> For said he, <HI>My Captain who dyed some years ago appeared to me, and told me, he was in Purgatory; and told me I must go a Pilgrimage to Saint</HI> Anne, <HI>doing Penance, and get a</HI> Mass <HI>said for him, and then he should be delivered.</HI> And many believed him, and were much affected with it; came and told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of it, to gain my Credit of their devised <HI>Purgatory:</HI> the Souldier told me, <HI>The Priests had counselled him to undertake this Pilgrimage.</HI> And I am apt to think, ordered his calling in at my Lord-lords, that I might see and speak with him. I laught at the conceit, that a Souldier must be pitch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon to be sent on this errand; but they were much displeased, and lamented my obstinacy, in that I would not be reclaimed from a denyal of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> by such a <HI>Miraculous Providence.</HI></P>
<P>As I was able, I spread the case before God, be∣seeching of him to disappoint them of their expecta∣tions, to Proselyte any of the Captives by this Stra∣tagem; and by the goodness of God it was not very Serviceable: for the Souldiers Conversation was such, that several among the <HI>French</HI> themselves judg¦ed it to be a <HI>Forgery.</HI> And tho the Captain spoken of was the Governours Lady's Brother, I never more heard any concernment or care to get him out of <HI>Purgatory.</HI></P>
<P>One of the Parish where I lived, told me, That on the <HI>Twenty-second</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. He was at <HI>Que∣beck,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="001340_0053_0FB2842383D3FB00"/>
at the <HI>Mendicant Fryars Church,</HI> on one of their <HI>Feast Days,</HI> in honour of a great <HI>Saint</HI> of <HI>their Order,</HI> and that at Five a Clock Mass in the Morning, near Two hundred Persons present. A great <HI>Grey Catt</HI> brake or push'd aside some Gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and entred into the Church, and pass'd along it near the Altar, and put out Five or Six Candles, that were burning; and that no one could tell which way the <HI>Catt</HI> went out: and he thought it was the Devil.</P>
<P>When I was in the City in <HI>September,</HI> I saw two <HI>English</HI> Maids who had lived with the <HI>Indians</HI> a long time. They told me, that an <HI>Indian</HI> had dyed at the place where they were; and that when sundry of his Relations were together in order to his burial, the <HI>Dead arose,</HI> and informed them, <HI>That at his Death he went to Hell, and there he saw all the Indians that had been Dead since their embracing the Pepish Religion; and warned them to leave it off, or they would be Damned too,</HI> and lay down Dead again. They said, the <HI>Indians</HI> were frightned, &amp; very Melancholly; but the <HI>Jesuit</HI> to whom they told this told them, <HI>It was only a delusi∣on of the Devil to draw them away from the true Religion;</HI> Adding, <HI>That he knew for certain that all those</HI> Indians <HI>who had been Dead spoken of by that</HI> Indian, <HI>were in Heaven, only one Squaw was gone to Hell who dyed with∣out Boptism.</HI> These Maids said also, That many of the <HI>Indians</HI> much Lamented their making a War a∣gainst the <HI>English,</HI> at the instigation of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Priests, after Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s going from <HI>Canada,</HI> was ready to think their time was short, for gaining <HI>English</HI> Proselytes, and doubled their diligence and
<PB N="48" REF="001340_0054_0FB2842480816500"/>
wiles, to gain over Persons to their Perswasion. I improved all opportunities I could, to Write to the <HI>English,</HI> that in that Way I might be Servicea∣ble to them. But many or most of my Letters treat∣ing about Religion were intercepted, and burnt. I had a Letter sent down to me by order of the Go∣vernour, that I had a liberty of Writing to my Chil∣dren and Friends, which should be continued; pro∣vided I Wrote about indifferent things, and said no∣thing in them about the points in controversy be∣tween them and us: And if I were so hardy as to Write Letters otherwise, they should endeavour to prevent their being delivered. Accordingly, I found many of them were burnt. But sometimes notice would be given to the <HI>English,</HI> that there were Let∣ters written, but that they were burnt; so that their Writing was somewhat useful tho' never perused by the <HI>English,</HI> because they judged those Letters con∣demned <HI>Popery.</HI> Many of our Letters Written from <HI>New-England,</HI> were never delivered, because of some expressions about Religion in them. And as I said before, after Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s departure from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> endeavours were very vigorous to seduce. Some were flattered with large Promises, others were threatned, and beaten, because they would not turn. And when two <HI>English</HI> Women, who had alwayes op∣posed their Religion were sick in the <HI>Hospital:</HI> they kept with them Night and Day, till they dyed; &amp; their friends kept from coming to visit them: after their death they gave out, that they dyed in the <HI>Romish Faith,</HI> and were received into their <HI>Communion.</HI> Be∣fore their Death Masses were said for them; &amp; they
<PB N="49" REF="001340_0055_0FB284290CD746F8"/>
buried in the <HI>Church-yard</HI> with all their Ceremonies. And after this, Letters sent into all parts to inform the <HI>English,</HI> that these two Women turn'd to their Religion, before their Death, and that it concern∣ed them to follow their Example, for they could not be more obstinate than these Women were in their Health, against the <HI>Romish</HI> Faith, and yet on a <HI>Death bed</HI> imbraced it. They told the <HI>English</HI> who lived near, <HI>That our Religion was a dangerous Religion to dye in.</HI> But I shall hereafter relate the just grounds we have to think these things were falsehoods.</P>
<P>I was informed, there was an <HI>English</HI> Girl bid to take and wear the <HI>Cross,</HI> and <HI>Cross her self:</HI> She re∣fused; they threatned her, and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wed her the <HI>Cross,</HI> At length, She had her choice, either to <HI>Cross her self,</HI> and take the <HI>Cross,</HI> or be <HI>Whipt,</HI> she chose to be <HI>Whipt▪</HI> and they took up her Clothes, and made as tho' they would correct her; but seeing her chusing indeed to suffer rather than comply, they desisted and tyed the <HI>Cross</HI> about her Neck. Some were taken &amp; shut up among their Religious, and all sorts of mean▪ used to gain them.</P>
<P>I received a Letter from one of my Neighbours, wherein he thus bewails.
 <Q>I obtained leave of my Master, to go to the <HI>Macqua</HI>-Fort to see my Chil∣dren, that I had not seen for a long time: I car∣ried a Letter from my Master; to shew that I had leave to come. When I came to the Fort, I heard one of my Children was in the Woods. I went to see a Boy I had there, who lived with one of the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> I had just askt him of his Welfare; he said his Master would come presently; he durst not stay
 <PB N="50" REF="001340_0056_0FB2842A96FAB0C0"/>
 to speak with me now, being in such awe of his Master. On which I withdrew, and when his Mas∣ter came in, I went and askt leave of him to speak with my Child, and shewed him my Letter. But he absolutely refused to let me see or speak with him; and said, I had brought no Letter from the Gover∣nour, and would not permit me to stay in the Fort, tho' I had Travelled on foot near Fifty Miles for no other errand than to see and speak with my Children.</Q></P>
<P>The same Person with another <HI>English</HI> man last Spring, obtained leave of the Governour General, to go to the same Fort on the same errand, &amp; carried Letters from the Governour to the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> that he might be permitted to speak with his Children. The Letter was deliver'd to the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> who told him, his Son was not at home, but gone a Hunting. Whenas he was hid from them, as he heard after∣ward, so the poor man lost his labour a second time. These men say, that when they returned to <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> one <HI>Laland,</HI> who was appointed as a spy, always to observe the motions of the <HI>English,</HI> told them, that one of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> had come in before them, and had told the Governour that the Lad was gone out a Hunting. And that the <HI>English</HI> man who accompanyed this poor man, went out into the Woods in hopes of finding the Lad; and saw him, but the Lad run away, and that he followed him &amp; call'd after him, but he would not stop; but holding but a Gun threatned to shoot him down, if he follow∣ed him, and so he was discouraged, and turn'd back. And says <HI>Laland, You will never leave going to see your
<PB N="51" REF="001340_0057_0FB2842D19AE7E50"/>
Children &amp; Neighbours, till some of you are kill'd.</HI> But the men told him, it was an absolute lye, let who would report it; for they had neither seen the Lad, nor did they go into the Woods to search after him. They judge this was told to the Governour, to prevent a∣ny <HI>English</HI> for the future going to see their Children and Neighbours. Some of ours say, they have been little better than absolutely promised, to have their Children who are among the Salvages, in case they themselves would imbrace <HI>Popery.</HI> And that the Priests had said, <HI>They had rather the Children should be among the</HI> Indians, <HI>as they did, than be brought out by the</HI> French, <HI>and so be in a readiness to return for</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>A <HI>Maid</HI> of our Town was put into a Religious house among the <HI>Nuns,</HI> for more than two years, and all sort of means, by flatteries, threatnings, and abusive carriages used to bring her to turn. They offered her Money, which when refused, especially the latter part of the time, they threatned her very much; sent for her before them, commanded her <HI>to Cross her self.</HI> She refused, they hit her a box on the Ear; bid her again, still she refused. The or∣dered a rod with Six branches full of knots to be brought; and when she refused, they struke her on the hands, with their renewing their Commands; and she stood to her refusals, till her hands were fill'd with Whales, with the blows. But one said, Beat her no more, we will give her to the <HI>Indians,</HI> if she wont turn. They pinch'd her Arms till they were black &amp; blue; and made her go into their Church, and because she would not <HI>Cross her self,</HI> struke her
<PB N="52" REF="001340_0058_0FB2842E53484398"/>
several blows with their hands on her face. A <HI>Squaw</HI> was brought in and said, <HI>She was sent to fetch her to the Indians:</HI> but she refused; the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> went away and said, <HI>She would bring her Husband with her to Mor∣row, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be carried away by force.</HI> She told me, She remembred what I told her one day, after the <HI>Nuns</HI> had threatned to give her away to the <HI>In∣dians;</HI> that they only said so to affright her, that they never would give her away. The <HI>Nuns</HI> told her, <HI>She should not be permitted any more to speak to the</HI> English; <HI>and that they would afflict her without giving her any rest, if she refused:</HI> but God preserved her from falling. This poor Girl had many Prayers go∣ing up to Heaven for her daily, and by name, be∣cause her Trials were more known to some of the <HI>English,</HI> than the Trials of others, who lived more re∣mote from them.</P>
<P>Here might be an <HI>History</HI> by it self, of the Trials and Sufferings of many of our Children, and Young ones, who have been abused, and after Separation from grown Persons, made to do as they would have them.</P>
<P>I shall here give an account of what was done to one of my Children, a Boy between Fifteen and Sixteen years of Age, Two hundred Miles distant from me, which occasioned grief and sorrow, that I want Words to utter; and yet kept under such awe, that he never d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Write any thing to me, for fear of being discovered in Writing about Religion. They threatned to put him to the <HI>Indians</HI> again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he would not turn; telling him, <HI>He was never bought out of their hands, but only sojourned with them, but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="53" REF="001340_0059_0FB2842FC712CA80"/>
would turn, he should never be put into their hands any more.</HI> The Priests would spend whole day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in urg∣ing of him. He was sent to School to learn to <HI>Read</HI> and <HI>Write French;</HI> the School-master sometimes flat∣tered him with Promises, if he would <HI>Cross</HI> himself, then threatned him if he would not. But when he saw flattering Promises of rewards, and threatnings were ineffectual, he struke him with a stick he had in his hand; and when he saw that would not do, he made him get down on his Knees about an hour, and then came and bid him make the sign of the <HI>Cross,</HI> and that without any delay; he still refused. Then he gave him a couple of Strokes, with a Whip he had in his hand; which Whip had three Branches and about twelve great knotsty'd in it. And again bid him make the <HI>Sign of the Cross;</HI> and if it was any Sin, he would bear it himself: and said also, <HI>You are afraid you shall be changed if you do it:</HI> but (said he) <HI>You will be the same, your Fingers wont be changed.</HI> And after he had made him shed many Tears, under his abuses and threatnings, he told him, <HI>He would have it done:</HI> And so thro' Cowardise and Fear of the Whip, he made the Sign. And did so for several days together with much ado, he was brought to <HI>Cross</HI> himself. And then the Master told him, <HI>He would have it done without his Particular bidding him.</HI> And when he came to say his Lesson and Cross'd not himself, the Master said, <HI>Have you forgot what I bid you do.</HI> No Sir, said he, Then the School-master said, <HI>Down on your Knees;</HI> and so kept him for an hour and half, till School was done: and so did for about a Week. When he saw this would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="54" REF="001340_0060_0FB284320670CDC0"/>
took the Whip, <HI>What wont you do it</HI> (said he) <HI>I will make you:</HI> and so again, frighted him to a comply∣ance. After this, Commanded him to go to the Church: when he refused, he told him, <HI>he would make him.</HI> And one Morning sent four of the big∣gest Boys of the School, to draw him by force to <HI>Mass.</HI> These, with other severities and witty stra∣tagems were used; and I utterly ignorant of any attempt made upon him, to bring him to change his Religon. His fear was such, that he never durst Write any of these things, least his Letters should fall into their hands, and he should again be deliver'd to the <HI>Indians.</HI> Hearing of an opportunity of Wri∣ting to him by one of the Parish where I was, going up to <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> I Wrote a Letter to him, and had by him a Letter from my Son; which I shall here insert.</P>

She promised to God that if she should recover, she would go to the <HI>Mass</HI> every day: She having on her hand a <HI>Crucifix,</HI> saying, <HI>Oh my Lord that I should have known thee so late!</HI> She did also make a Prayer to the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> the two last days of the Week.

the 24<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> at three a Clock in the afternoon. The next day, the <HI>Priest</HI> did commend that Womans Soul to the Prayers of the Congre∣gation in the <HI>Mass,</HI> in the afternoon she was ho∣nourably buried in the Church-yard next to the Church, close to the body of the Justice <HI>Pese</HI> Wife; all the People being present at her Funeral. The same day in the Evening, Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> with an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Woman, went to <HI>Esther Jones;</HI> she did at first disdain, but a little after she confess'd, there were <HI>Seven Sacraments, Christs Body present,</HI> the <HI>Sacrament of the Mass,</HI> the <HI>Inequality of Power among the Pastors of the Church;</HI> and being returned to wait by her all Night long, he read &amp; expounded to her some part of the <HI>Catholick Confession of Faith</HI> to her satis∣faction. About Midnight he ask'd her, <HI>Whether she might not confess her Sins;</HI> I doubt not but I may, said she: And two hours after, she made unto him a fervent confession of all the Sins of her whole Life. When he said, <HI>He was to offer Christ to his Father for her;</HI> She liked it very well. The Supe∣riour of the <HI>Nuns</HI> being come in to see her, she now desired that she might receive Christs Body before she dyed. She did also show Mrs. <HI>Stilson,</HI> a great mind to receive the Sacrament of <HI>Extream<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Unction,</HI> and said, <HI>That if ever she should recover and get home, she would have reproached the</HI> Ministers, <HI>for their neglecting that Sacrament so plainly commanded by St.</HI> James. In the afternoon, after she had beg'd pardon for her wavering, and the Catholick Con∣fession of Faith was read aloud to her, in the hear∣ing of Mr. <HI>Craston,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Stilson,</HI> and another <HI>English</HI>

She was then anointed with <HI>Holy Oyl:</HI> but before, she said to Mr. <HI>Meriel, Why have you not yet, Sir, forgiven my Sins?</HI> In the Night fol∣lowing, that Priest, and Mr. <HI>Dubison</HI> were continu∣ally by her; and sometimes Praying to God in her name, and Praying to the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and o∣other <HI>Saints.</HI> She said also, <HI>I believe all: I am very glad Christ was offered to his Father for me.</HI> Six or Se∣ven hours before she dyed, a <HI>Crucifix</HI> was show'd to her by Mr. <HI>Dubison,</HI> she took it and laid it upon her heart, and kiss'd it; and then the <HI>Nuns</HI> hang∣ing it with a pair of <HI>Beads</HI> upon her Neck. A little before she dyed, Mr. <HI>Dubison</HI> askt her to <HI>Pray for him in Heaven;</HI> she promised him: so she gave up the Ghost, at <HI>Ten</HI> of the Clock the 27<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> whilst the high <HI>Mass</HI> was saying; she was soon commended to the Prayers.

</LETTER>
<P>I Have her transcribed the Letter in the very words of it without the least alteration: the same for substance was sent to several other Cap∣tives. When I had this Letter, I presently knew it to be of Mr. <HI>Meriels</HI> composing; but the Messen∣ger who brought the Letter, brought word that my Son had imbraced their Religion. Afterwards when
<PB N="58" REF="001340_0064_0FB2843BB8440998"/>
some blamed him for letting me know of it, because (they said) they feared my Sorrow would shorten my days. He told me, he thought with himself that if he was in my case, he should be willing to know the worst, and therefore told me as he would have desired to have known if in my place. I thank'd him, acknowledging it a favour to let me know of it: But the News was ready to Over-whelm me with Grief and Sorrow. <HI>I made my complaint to GOD, and Mourned before Him; Sorrow and Anguish took hold up∣on me.</HI> I ask'd of God to direct me what to do, and how to Write, and find out an opportunity of con∣veying a Letter to him; and committed this diffi∣culty to his Providence. I now found a greater op∣position to a Patient, Quiet, Humble, Resignation to the Will of God than I should otherwise have known, if not so tryed. Here I thought of my Af∣flictions and Tryals; my Wife and Two Children kill'd, and many of my Neighbours; and my self, so many of my Children and Friends in a Popish Captivity, separated from our Children, not capa∣ble to come to them to instruct them in the Way they ought to go; and cunning crafty Enemies, u∣sing all their subtilty to insinuate into Young ones, such Principles as would be pernicious. I thought with my self how happy many others were, in that they had their Children with them, under all ad∣vantages to bring them up in the <HI>Nurture and Ad∣monition of the Lord.</HI> Whilest we were separated one from another, and our Children in great Peril of Imbracing damnable doctrines. <HI>Oh! that all Parents who Read this History would Bless God for the advantages
<PB N="59" REF="001340_0065_0FB28443AFDD8270"/>
they have of Educating their Children; and faithfully im∣prove it!</HI> I Mourned when I thought with my self that I had one Child with the <HI>Macqua's,</HI> a second turn'd to <HI>Popery,</HI> and a little Child of Six years of Age, in danger from a Child to be instructed in <HI>Po∣pery;</HI> and knew full well that all endeavours would be used to prevent my seeing or speaking with them. But in the midst of all these God gave me a secret hope, that He would magnify His Power and free Grace, and disappoint all their crafty designs. <HI>When I look'd on the right hand and on the left, all refuge failed, and none shewed any care for my Soul.</HI> But God brought that Word to uphold me; <HI>Who is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can ask or think.</HI> As also that, <HI>Is any thing too hard for God?</HI> I Pray'd to God to direct me; and Wrote very short the first time, and in general terms, fearing least if I should Write about things in controversy, my Letters would not come to him. I therefore address'd him with the following Letter.</P>

<P>YOurs of <HI>January</HI> 23<HI>d.</HI> I received, and with it had the Tidings that you had made an abjuration of the <HI>Protestant Faith,</HI> for the <HI>Romish:</HI> News that I heard with the most distressing, afflicting, sorrowful Spirit that ever I heard any News. Oh! I pitty you, I mourn over you day and night! Oh I pitty your weakness, that thro' the craftiness of man you are turned from the Simplicity of the Gospel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> per∣swade my self you have done it through ignorance Oh! why have you neglected to ask a Fathers Ad∣vice
<PB N="60" REF="001340_0066_0FB2844C52B8ADC8"/>
in an affair of so great importance as the change of Religion! God knows that the <HI>Catechism</HI> in which I Instructed you, is according to the Word of God; and so will be found in the Day of Judgment. Oh! consider and bethink your self what you have done! And whether you ask me or not, my poor Child I cannot but Pray for you, that you may be recovered out of the Snare you are taken in. Read the <HI>Bible, Pray in Secret;</HI> make CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness your only</HI> Plea <HI>before</HI> GOD, for Justification: Beware of all Immorality, and of Prophaning God's <HI>Sabbaths.</HI> Let a Fathers Advice be ask'd for the future, in all things of weight and moment. <HI>What is a man profited if he gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI> I desire to be humbled under the Mighty hand of God thus afflicting of me. I would not do as you have done for Ten thousand Worlds. My heart akes within me, but I will yet wait upon the Lord; to Him will I com∣mit your case day and night: He can perform all things for me and mine; and can yet again reco∣ver you from your fall. He is a <HI>God forgiving ini∣quity, transgression and sin: to the Lord our God belong forgivenesses though we have rebelled.</HI> I charge you not to be instrumental to ensnare your poor Brother <HI>Warham,</HI> or any other, and so add Sin to Sin. Ac∣cept of my Love, and dont forsake a Fathers advice, who above all things desires that your Soul may be Saved in the day of the Lord.</P>

WHat I mournfully Wrote, I followed with my poor Cryes to God in Heaven to make ef∣fectual, to cause in him a consideration of what he had done. God saw what a Proud heart I had, &amp; what need I had to be so answered <HI>out of the Whirl∣wind,</HI> that I might be humbled before Him. Not having any answer to my Letter for some Weeks. I Wrote the following Letter, as I was enabled of God, and sent to him by a faithful hand; which by the blessing of God was made effectual for his good, and the good of others, who had fall'n to <HI>Popery;</HI> and for the establishing and strengthening of others to resist the Essays of the Adversary to Truth. God brought good out of this evil, and made what was designed to promote their interest, an occasion of shame to them.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Son Samuel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have waited till now for an answer from you, hoping to hear from you, why you made an Abjuration of the <HI>Protestant Faith,</HI> for the <HI>Romish.</HI> But since you continue to neglect to Write to me about it, as you neglected to take any advice or counsel from a Father, when you did it. I cannot forbear Writing again, and making some reflections on the Letter you Wrote me last, about the two Wo∣men. It seems to me from those words of <HI>Abigail Turbet'</HI>s in your Letter▪ or rather of Mr. <HI>Meriels,</HI> which you transcribed for him. [<HI>Abigail Turbet</HI> sent for Mr. <HI>Meriel,</HI> she committed her Soul into his hand, and was ready to do whatsoever he pleased.]
<PB N="62" REF="001340_0068_0FB28450BA4A12C8"/>
I say, it seems rational to believe, that she had not the use of her reason; its an expression to be ab∣horred by all who have any true sense of Religion. Was Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> a God, a Christ? could he bear to hear such Words and not reject them; replying don't commit your Soul into my hands, but see that you commit your Soul into the Hands of GOD thro' <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and do whatever God Commands you in His <HI>Holy Word.</HI> As for me, I am a creature, and can't Save your Soul, but will tell you of <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is no other Name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be Saved<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Had he been a faithful <HI>Minister</HI> of JESUS CHRIST he would have said, 'tis an honour due to CHRIST alone. The holy Apostle says, <HI>Now unto him that is able to keep you, and present you faultless before the presence of his Glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wise</HI> GOD our <HI>Saviour be glory, and majesty, dominion and power both now and ever, Amen Jude</HI> 24, 25. v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses. As to what you Write about Praying to the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and other Saints, I make this reply, Had Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> done his duty, he should have said to them, as 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. <HI>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our sins.</HI> The Scriptures say, <HI>There is one God, and one Mediator be∣tween God and man, the Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS. Yea, CHRIST said, Go and Preach, <HI>He that Believeth &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Baptised, shall be Saved.</HI> The Apostle in <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 8. Saith, <HI>But though wear an Angel from Heaven Preach any other Gospel unto you, then that we have Preached to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let him be accursed.</HI> They never Preach'd, Prayed
<PB N="63" REF="001340_0069_0FB284534C6AE4E0"/>
to the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> or other <HI>Saints.</HI> As you would be Saved hear what the Apostle saith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 13. &amp;c. <HI>Neither is there any Creature that is not manifest in his fight; but all things are naked, and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great High Priest that is entred into the Heaven,</HI> JESUS <HI>the Son of God, let us hold fast our Profession: for we have not an High Priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin; let us therefore come hold∣ly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need.</HI> Which words do hold forth, how that CHRIST JESUS is in every respect qualifyed to be a Mediatour and Interces∣sor and I am sure they can't be applyed to any meer creature, to make them capable of our Reli∣gious trust. When <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> have said all they can, they are not able to prove, that the Saints in Heaven have a knowledge of what Pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are directed to them. Some say they know them one way, others say they have the knowledge of them in another way: and that which they have fix'd up▪ on as most probable to them, is, That they know of them from their beholding the face of God; Seeing God they known these Prayers: But this is a great mistake. Tho' the Saints see and know God in a Glorious manner, yet they have not an insinite knowledge; and it does no wayes follow that be∣cause they see God, they know all Prayers that are directed to them upon the Earth. And God has no where in His Word told us, that the Saints have such a knowledge. Besides, were it a thing possible for
<PB N="64" REF="001340_0070_0FB284548318DCA8"/>
them to have a knowledge of what Prayers are di∣rected to them, it does not follow that they are to be Pray'd to, or have religious honour con∣fer'd upon them. The <HI>Romanists</HI> can neither give one Scripture Precept of Example for Praying to them; but God has provided a <HI>Mediator,</HI> who knows all our Petitions, and is Faithful and Merciful e∣nough, and we have both Scripture Precept &amp; Ex∣ample, to look to Him as our Mediator and Advocate with the Father. Further it can't be proved that its consistent with the Saints being creatures, as well as with their happiness, to have a knowledge of Pray∣ers from all parts of the World at the same time, from many Millions together about things so vastly differing one from another: and then to present those Supplications for all that look to them, its not Humility but Will Worship. Col. 2. 18. <HI>Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility, wor∣shipping of Angels,</HI> verse 23. <HI>Which things indeed have a shew of Wisdom and Will Worship, and humility.</HI> For what humility can it be, to distrust the Way that God has provided and encouraged us to come to Him in, and impose upon God a Way of our own devising? Was not God angry with <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> for imposing upon him after such a fort? 1 <HI>King.</HI> 12. 33. <HI>So he offered upon the Altar which he had made in Bethel, the fifth day of the eighth Month, which he devised of his own heart.</HI> Therefore CHRIST saith, <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 7. <HI>Howheit, in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men:</HI> Before the coming of Christ, &amp; His entring into Heaven as an Intercessor. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 25. <HI>Wherefore he is able to Save them to the utter∣most
<PB N="65" REF="001340_0071_0FB28456EEE9D3A0"/>
that come to God by him, seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> liveth in make intercession for them.</HI> I say before Christs en∣tring into Heaven as an Intercessor, not one word of any Prayer to Saints, what reason can be given that now there is of so many Saints to make In∣tecession, when CHRIST as a <HI>Priest</HI> is entred into Heaven to make Intercession for us? The answer that the <HI>Romanists</HI> give is a very fable &amp; falsehood: Namely that there were no Saints in Heaven, till after the Resurrection and Ascention of Christ, but were reserved in a place called <HI>Lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Patrum,</HI> and so had not the beatisical Vision. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 5. 24. <HI>Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him.</HI> If he was not taken into Heaven, what can be the sense of those Words, <HI>for God took him?</HI> Again, 2 King. 2. 1. When the Lord would take up <HI>Elija<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> into Heaven by a Whirlwind, <HI>verse</HI> 11. <HI>There appeared a Chariot of fire and Horses of Fire, and parte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both asunder, and Elijab went up by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wind into Heaven.</HI> Must the truth of the Scripture be call'd in questi∣on to uphold their Notions? Besides, tis not con∣sistent with reason to suppose, that <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>och</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> instead of having a peculiar priviledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouchsafed to them, for their eminency in holiness, should be less happy for so long a time then the rest of the Saints deceased, who are glorifyed in Heaven; which must be, if they are yet kept and must be till the day of Judgment out of Heaven, and the beati∣fical Vision, in an earthly Paradise, according to some of the <HI>Romanists,</HI> or in some other place they know not where: according to others.

And saith, <HI>All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll down and worship me.</HI> Then saith <HI>Jesus to him, Get thee hence Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, for it is written thou shalt whorship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</HI> That phrase, and <HI>Him only shalt thou serve,</HI> excludes all creatures. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 8, 9. <HI>I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel, which shewed me these things; then saith he to me, see thou do it not, for I am thy fellow ser∣vant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book, worship God.</HI> Which plain∣ly shews, that God only is to be Worshipped with a religious Worship. None can think, that Saint <HI>John</HI> intended to give the highest Divine Worship to the Angel, who saith, Don't fall down &amp; worship me; its Gods due, <HI>Worship God.</HI> So Act. 10. 25, 26. <HI>As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him, but Peter took him up, saying stand up, I my self also am a man.</HI> See also Lev. 19 10. The Words of the Second Commandment (which the <HI>Romanists</HI> either leave out, or add to the first Commandment saying, <HI>Thou shalt have no other gods before me,</HI> adding <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) I say the Words of the second Commandment are, <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy self any Graven Image, or any likeness of any thing that is in Hea∣ven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not how down thy self to them, nor serve them, for I the Lord thy God am a Jealous God,</HI> &amp;c. These words being inserted in the Letter, that came from your Brother <HI>Eleazar</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> the last Summer, was the cause of the Letters being sent down from <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> and not given to you; when so near you: as I suppose
<PB N="67" REF="001340_0073_0FB2845A81A088D0"/>
there being no other clause of the Letter that could be objected against, and the reason why found at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> when I sent it to you a second time enclo∣sed in a Letter Written by my self. The <HI>Brazen Serpent</HI> made by Divine appointment as a Type of CHRIST, when abused to Superstition, was by re∣forming <HI>Hezekiah</HI> broken in pieces. As to what the Romanists plead about the Lawfulness of <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Saint Worship,</HI> from those likenesses of things made in <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, its nothing to the purpose. We don't say it is not lawful to make or have a Picture, but those carved Images were not in the Temple to be adored, bowed down to, or worshiped. There is no manner of consequence, that because there were Images made in <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple that were not adored and worshipped, that therefore its now law∣ful to make and fall down before Images, and Pray to them, and so Worship them. Religious <HI>Worship∣ping of Saints</HI> can't be defended from, but is forbid∣den in the Scriptures; and for fear of loosing their Disciples, the <HI>Romanists</HI> keep away from them the Bible, and oblige them to believe as they say they must believe. As tho' there was no use to be made of our reason about our Souls; and yet the <HI>Bereans</HI> were counted noble, for <HI>Searching the Scriptures,</HI> to see whether the things Preach'd by Saint <HI>Paul</HI> were so or no. They dare not allow you liberty to speak with your Father, or others, for fear their Errors should be discovered to you. Again, you Write, that <HI>Esther Jones</HI> confess'd, that there was an inequality of Power among the Pastors of the Church. An argument to convince the World, that because the
<PB N="68" REF="001340_0074_0FB2845BF86C0BC8"/>
Priests in fallacious wayes, caused a Woman distem∣pered with a very high Feaver, if not distracted, to say, she confess'd there was an inequality of Power among the Pastors of the Church, therefore all the World are obliged to believe that there is a <HI>Pope.</HI> An argument to be sent from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beersheba</HI> eve∣ry where, where any <HI>English</HI> Captives are, to gain their belief of a <HI>Pope.</HI> Can any rational man think, that CHRIST in the Sixteenth Chapter of <HI>Mathew,</HI> gave Saint <HI>Peter</HI> such a Power as the Papists speak of; or that the Disciples so understood CHRIST? when immediately there arose a dispute among them, who should be the <HI>Greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> Math. 18. 1. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same time came the Disciples of Je∣sus, saying, who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> The rock spoken of in the Sixteenth of <HI>Mathew,</HI> not the Person of <HI>Peter,</HI> but the confession made by him, and the same Power is given to all the Disciples, if you compare one Scripture with another; not one word in any place of Scripture of such a <HI>Vicarship</HI> power as of a <HI>Pope,</HI> nor any solid founda∣tion of proof that <HI>Peter</HI> had a greater Authority, than the rest of the Apostles. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 6. <HI>That you might learn in us, not to think of men above that which is written.</HI> Yea, the Apostle condemns them. 1 <HI>Con</HI> 1. 12. for their contentions, <HI>One saying, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>I of</HI> Apollos, <HI>and I of</HI> Caephas; no more of <HI>Peters</HI> being a foundation than any of the rest. <HI>For we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Pro∣phets,</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>himself being the chief corner stone.</HI> Not one word in any of <HI>Peters</HI> Epistles; showing that he had greater power than the other

Wherefore my sentence is, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not a word that St. <HI>Peter</HI> was chief. Again, you find <HI>Peter</HI> himself sent forth by the other Apo∣stles, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 14. <HI>The Apostles sent unto them</HI> Peter <HI>&amp;</HI> John.

When <HI>Paul</HI> reproved <HI>Peter, Gal.</HI> 2. he does not defend himself, by mentioning an infal∣libility in himself as <HI>Christ's Vicar,</HI> or reprove <HI>Paul</HI> for his boldness.</P>
<P>The Roman Catholick Church can't be a true Church of Christ, in that it makes Laws directly contrary to the Laws and Commands of Christ. As for example, in with-holding the Wine or the Cup from the Laiety, in the <HI>Lords-Supper;</HI> whenas Christ commands the same to drink who were to eat. Their evasion that the Blood is in the Body, and so they partake of both in eating, is a great fallacy built on a false foundation of <HI>Transubstanti∣on.</HI> For when men eat, they can't be said to drink, which Christ commands, for Christ commands that we <HI>take the Cup and drink,</HI> which is not done in eating; besides the Priests themselves won't be so put off. The words (<HI>this is my Body</HI>) do only in∣tend, this doth signify of represent my Body, which will appear if you compare Scripture with Scrip∣ture, for after the Consecration the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> calls it Bread, and the fruit of the Vine. <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 11. <HI>It is the Lords Passe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver;</HI> that is, it represents it. In all the Evangelists, you read of killing and eating the Passeover, a few lines or verses before these words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> which plainly show, that our Saviour in the same way of figurative expres∣sion speaks of the <HI>Gospel Sacrament.</HI> If these words were taken as the <HI>Romanists</HI> expound them, he must eat his own Body himself, whole and entire in
<PB N="71" REF="001340_0077_0FB28462491410F0"/>
his own hands; and after that each one of the Dis∣ciples eat him entire, and yet he set at the Table whole, untouched at the same time; contradicti∣ons impossible to be defended by any rational ar∣guments. Yea, his whole Body, must be now in Heaven and in a thousand other places, and in the mouth of every Communicant at the same time, and that both as a broken and unbroken Sacrifice, and be subject to putrefaction. CHRIST is said to be a <HI>Door,</HI> a <HI>true Vine,</HI> a <HI>Way,</HI> a <HI>Rock;</HI> What work shall we make if we expound these in a literal man∣ner, as the <HI>Romanists</HI> do, when they say, <HI>this is my Body,</HI> is meant of the real Body of Christ in the Eucharist? It's said, 1 Cor. 10. 4. <HI>And did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</HI> Was Christ literally a Rock, think you? Yea, it's absurd to believe, that a Priest uttering a few words over a Wafer not above an inch square, can make it a God, or the Body of Christ entire as it was offered on the Cross. A blasphemy to pretend to a power of making God at their pleasure; &amp; then eat him, &amp; give him to others to be eaten, or shut him up in their Altars: that they can utter the same words, and make a God or not make a God, ac∣cording to their intention, and that the people are obliged to believe that it is God, and so adore it, when they never hear any word of consecration, nor know the Priests intention. As to what you write about the <HI>Holy Mass:</HI> I reply, it's wholly an Humane Invention; not a word of such a Sacri∣fice in the whole Bible, its being a Sacrifice propi∣tiatory

Heb. 9. 12. <HI>By his own blood he entred in once in∣to the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</HI> 25, 26, 27, 28. <HI>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High-priest entereth into the holy place, every year with the blood of others: For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the sacrifice of himself.

change after Death from an afflicted to an happy place and state. <HI>Purgatory</HI> is a phansy for the en∣riching the Clergy, and impoverishing the Laiety. The Notion of it a fatal Snare to many Souls, who sin with hopes of easy getting Priestly abso∣lutions at Death, and buying off Torments with their Money. The Soul at Death goes immediate∣ly to Judgment, and so to Heaven or Hell. No au∣thentick Place of Scripture, mentions so much as one Word of any such place or state. Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> told me, if I found one errour in our Religion, it was enough to cause me to disown our whole Religion: by his argument you may see, what reason you have to avoid that Religion that is so full of Errors. Be∣think your self and consult the Scriptures, if you can get them (I mean the Bible:) Can you think their Religion is right, when they are afraid to let you have an English Bible? Or to speak with your Father, or other of your Christian Neighbours, for fear they should give you such Convictions of truth that they can't remove? Can that Religion be true, that can't bear an Examination from the Scriptures, that are a <HI>Perfect Rule</HI> in matters of Faith? Or that must be upheld by Ignorance, especially Ignorance of the holy Scriptures? These things have I written as in my heart I believe. I long for your recovery, and will not cease to Pray for it. I am now a man of a Sorrowful Spirit, and look upon your fall as the most aggravating circumstance of my afflictions, and am perswaded that no pains will be wanting, to prevent me from seeing or spea∣king with you; but I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w that Gods Grace is all-sufficient;

I long to see &amp; speak with you, but I ne∣ver forget you; my love to you, and to your Bro∣ther and Sister, and to all our Fellow-Prisoners. Let me hear from you as often as you can. I hope God will appear for us before it be long. There are a great many other things in the Letter, that deserve to be refuted, but I shall be too tedious in remarking of them all at once. Yet would not pass over that passage in the Letter, that <HI>Esther Jones</HI> con∣fessed, that there were <HI>Seven Sacraments.</HI> To which I answer, That some of the most Learned of the Romish Religion, confessed (without the distrac∣ting pains of a violent Feaver) and left it up∣on record in Print, that it can't be convincing∣ly made out from the Scripture, that there are Seven Sacraments, and that their most incontes∣table proof is from tradition, and by their tra∣ditions they might have found Seventeen as well as Seven: considering that four Popes suc∣cessively, spent their lives in purging and cor∣recting old Authors. But no man can out of the Holy Scriptures, prove any more than two Sacraments of Divine Institution, under the New Testament, namely, <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lords-Supper.</HI> If you make the Scriptures a perfect rule of faith as you ought to do, you can't believe as the Ro∣mish

</LETTER>
<P>THis Priest Mr. <HI>Meriel,</HI> has brought many Let∣ters to him and bid him Write them over and send them, and so he has done for many others. By this as also by Mrs. <HI>Stilsons,</HI> saying, She does not think that either of these Women did change their Religion before their Death; she affirms also, that oftentimes during their Sickness, whilst they had the use of their reason, they protested against the
<PB N="77" REF="001340_0083_0FB28474004EC7F8"/>
Romish Religion and Faith. Its evident that these Women never dyed <HI>Papists,</HI> but that it was a wily Stratagem of the Priests to advance their Religion; for Letters were sent immediately, after their death, to use this as a perswasive argument to gain others. But God in His Providence gave in farther Con∣viction of their fallaciousness in this matter.</P>
<P>For the last Summer, one <HI>Biggilow</HI> of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> a Captive at <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> was very Sick in the <HI>Hospi∣tal,</HI> and in the judgment of all with a Sickness to Death. Then the Priests and others gave out, that he was turned to be of their Religion, and taken in∣to their communion: But contrary to their expecta∣tion he was brought back from the gates of Death, and would comply with none of their rites: say∣ing, that whilst he had the use of his reason, he ne∣ver spake any thing in favour of their Religion. And that he never disown'd the <HI>Protestant Faith,</HI> nor would he now. So that they were silenced and put to shame. There is no reason to think that these two Women were any more <HI>Papists</HI> than he; but they are Dead and cannot speak. One of the Wit∣nesses spoken of in the fore-mentioned Letter, told me, she knew of no such thing, and said Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> told her, that he never heard a more fervent and affectionate Prayer, than one which <HI>Esther Jones</HI> made a little before her Death. I am verily perswaded, that he calls that Prayer to God so full of affection and confession, the confession made by her of the Sins of her whole Life. These two Women always in their health, and so in their Sickness, opposed all <HI>Popish</HI> Principles, as all that knew them can testify,
<PB N="78" REF="001340_0084_0FB284761F8C4B40"/>
so long as they could be permitted to go and speak with them. One of these Women was taken from the <HI>Eastward,</HI> and the other, namely <HI>Esther Jones</HI> from <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>March</HI> 1706. Mr. <HI>Sheldon</HI> came again to <HI>Canada,</HI> with Letters from His Ex∣cellency our GOVERNOUR, at which time I was a few days at <HI>Quebeck.</HI> And when I was there, One Night about Ten a Clock, there was an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> that made a report like a Cannon, and made the Houses to tremble: It was heard and felt many Leagues, all along the Island of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> and other places. When Mr. <HI>Sheldon</HI> came the second time, the Adversaries did what they could to retard the time of our return, to gain time to seduce our Young Ones to <HI>Popery.</HI> Such were sent away who were judged ungainable, and most of the Younger sort still kept. Some still flattered with Promises of reward; and great Essayes to get others Married among them. One debauched, and then in Twen∣ty-four Hours of time Published, taken into their Communion &amp; Married; but the poor Soul has had time since to lament her Sin &amp; Folly, with a bitter cry; and asks your Prayers, that God of His So∣vereign Grace would yet bring out of the horrible Pit, she has thrown her self into. Her Name was <HI>Rachael St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rer</HI> of <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P>In ▪<HI>April,</HI> one <HI>Zebediah Williams</HI> of our Town dy∣ed: he was a very hopeful and pious young man, who carried himself so in his Captivity, as to edify
<PB N="79" REF="001340_0085_0FB2847782236CA0"/>
several of the <HI>English;</HI> and recover one fallen to <HI>Popery,</HI> taken the last War; tho' some were enraged against him on these accounts; yet even the <HI>French</HI> where he Sojourned, and with whom he Conversed, would say he was a good man: One that was very Prayerful to God, and Studious and Painful in read∣ing the holy Scriptures. A man of a good under∣standing, a desirable Conversation: in the begin∣ning of his last Sickness he made me a Visit (before he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent to the Hospital at <HI>Quebeck</HI>) to my great satisfaction, and our mutual consolation and com∣fort in our Captivity. As he had several times be∣fore, living not above two Miles from me over the River, at the Island of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> about Six Weeks or Two Months. After his Death, the <HI>French</HI> told me, <HI>Zebediah</HI> was gone to Hell and Damned: For, said they, He has appeared since his Death (to one <HI>Joseph Egerly,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> man, who was taken the last War) in flaming fire, telling him, he was Damned for refusing to imbrace the Romish Re∣ligion, when such pains were used to bring him to the true Faith, and for being instrumental to draw him away from the <HI>Romish Communion,</HI> forsaking the Mass; and was therefore now come to advertise him of his danger. I told them, <HI>I Judged it to be a Popish Lye:</HI> Saying, <HI>I bless God our Religion needs no lyes to uphold, maintain, and establish it, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> theirs did.</HI> But they affirmed it to be true, telling me, how God approved of their Religion, and Witnessed miracu∣lously against ours. But I still told them, I was perswaded his Soul was in Heaven, and that these reports were only devised fables to seduce Souls.
<PB N="80" REF="001340_0086_0FB284787B4A3900"/>
For several Weeks they affirmed it, telling me, that all who came over the River from the Island affir∣med it to be a truth. I beg'd of God to blast this Hellish Design of theirs, so that in the issue it might be to render their Religion more abominable, and that they might not gain one Soul by such a stra∣tagem. After some weeks had passed in such as∣sertions, there came one into my Landlords House, affirming it to be a truth reported of <HI>Zebediah,</HI> say∣ing, <HI>Joseph Egerly</HI> had been over the River, &amp; told one of our Neighbours this Story. After a few hours I saw that Neighbour, and askt him whether he had seen <HI>Egerly</HI> lately; he said yes, What News told he to you? None said he. Then I told him what was affirmed as a truth; he answered, <HI>Egerly</HI> said nothing like this to him, and he was perswaded he would have told him, if there had been any truth in it. About a week after this, came one <HI>John Boult</HI> from the Island of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> a Lad taken from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> a very serious sober Lad of a∣bout Seventeen years of Age; he had often before came over with <HI>Zebediah</HI> to visit me. At his com∣ing in, he much lamented the loss of <HI>Zebediah,</HI> and told me, that for several weeks they had told him the same Story, affirming it to be a truth, and that <HI>Egerly</HI> was so awakened by it, as to go again to Mass every day, urging him; since God in such a mira∣culous way offered such conviction of the truth of their Religion, and the falshood &amp; danger of ours, to come over to their Religion, or else his damna∣tion would be dreadfully aggravated. He (said he) could have no rest for them day and night; but
<PB N="81" REF="001340_0087_0FB2847AD658D340"/>
(said he) I told them their Religion was contrary to the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and therefore I would not em∣brace it; &amp; that I did not believe what they said. And says he, to me, one day I was sitting in the house, and <HI>Egerly</HI> came in, and I spake to him before the whole Family (in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, for he could not speak much <HI>English</HI>) and askt him of this Story, he answered, <HI>it's a great falshood,</HI> saying, <HI>he never ap∣peared to me, nor have I ever reported any such thing to any body; and that he had never been at the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss since</HI> Zebediah'<HI>s death.</HI> At the hearing of which they were silenced and put to shame; we blessed God together, for discovering their wickedness, and dis∣appointing them in what they aimed at, &amp; pray'd to God to deliver us and all the Captives from de∣lusions, and recover them who had fallen, and so parted. After which I took my Pen and wrote a Letter to one Mr. <HI>Samuel Hill,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Captive, taken from <HI>Wells,</HI> who liv'd at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> &amp; his Bro∣ther <HI>Ebenez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Hill</HI> to make a discovery of this lying Plot, to warn them of their danger, and assure them of the falshood of this report; but the Letter fell into the hands of the Priests, and was never delivered. This <HI>Egerly</HI> came home with us, so that they gained nothing but shame by this strata∣gem: God often disappoints the crafty devices of wicked men.</P>
<P>In the latter end of Summer, they told me they had News from <HI>New-England</HI> by one who had been a Captive at <HI>Boston,</HI> who said that the Ministers at <HI>Boston</HI> had told the <HI>French</HI> Captives, that the Pro∣testant Religion was the only true Religion; and
<PB N="82" REF="001340_0088_0FB28481CB10AC10"/>
that as a confirmation of it, they would raise a dead person to life before their eyes for their con∣viction; and that having perswaded one to feign himself dead, they came and pray'd over him, and then commanded him in the <HI>Name of Christ</HI> (whose Religion they kept pure) to arise, they call'd and commanded, but he never arose; so that instead of raising the Dead, they killed the Living; which the bereav'd Relations discovered. I told them, it was an old Lye and Calumny against <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> new vamped, and that they only change the persons and place: but they affirmed it to be a truth; I told them I wondred they were so fond of a faith propagated, and then maintain'd by ly∣ing words.</P>
<P>We were always out of hopes of being returned before Winter, the season proving so cold in the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> and were praying to God to prepare our hearts, with all holy submission to his Holy Will, to Glorify his Holy Name in a way of passive Obedience in the Winter. For my own part, I was informed by several who came from the City, that the Lord <HI>Intendant</HI> said, if <HI>More</HI> re∣turned and brought word that <HI>Battis</HI> was in Prison, he would put me into Prison, and lay me in Irons. They would not permit me to go into the City, saying, I always did harm when I came to the Ci∣ty, and if at any time I was at the City, they would perswade the Governour to send me back again.</P>
<P>In the beginning of last <HI>June,</HI> the Superior of the Priests came to the Parish where I was, and
<PB N="83" REF="001340_0089_0FB28489B006E048"/>
told me, he saw I wanted my Friend Captain <HI>de Beauville,</HI> and that I was ragged. But says he, your obstinacy against our Religion discourages from providing better Cloaths; I told him it was bet∣ter going in a ragged Coat, than with a ragged Conscience.</P>
<P>In the beginning of last <HI>June,</HI> went out an Ar∣my of Five Hundred <HI>Maqua's</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> with an intention to have fallen on some <HI>English</HI> Towns down <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, but lighting on a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok Indian,</HI> who ran away in the night, they were dis∣couraged; saying, he would alarm the whole Coun∣try: about Fifty as some say, or Eighty as others, returned: Thus God restrained their Wrath.</P>
<P>When they were promising themselves another Winter, to draw away the <HI>English</HI> to Popery, came News of an <HI>English</HI> Briganteen a coming, and that the Honourable Capt. <HI>Samuel Appleton</HI> Esqr. was coming Ambassador, to fetch off the Captives, and Capt. <HI>John Bonner</HI> with him. I cannot tell you how, the Clergy and others laboured to stop many of the Prisoners, to some Liberty, to some Mony, and yearly Pensions were offered, if they would stay. Some they urged to tarry at least till the Spring of the year, telling them it was so late in the year, they would be lost by Shipwrack if they went now; some younger ones they told, if they went home they would be Damned and burn in Hell for ever, to affright them; day and night they were urging of them to stay. And I was threatned to be sent aboard, without a permission to come ashoar again, if I should again discourse with any of the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="001340_0090_0FB2849105A294C8"/>
who were turned to their Religion; at <HI>Mont-Royal</HI> especially all crafty endeavours were used to stay the <HI>English.</HI> They told my Child, <HI>if he would stay, he should have an honourable Pension from the King every year, and that his Master, who was an old man, and the richest in</HI> Canada, <HI>would give him a great deal; telling him if he returned he would be poor, for</HI> (said they) <HI>your Father is poor, has lost all his Estate; it was all burnt.</HI> But he would not be prevailed with to stay; and others were also in like manner urged to stay, but God graciously brake the snare and brought them out. They endeavoured in the Fall of the year, to have prevailed with my Son to have gone to <HI>France,</HI> when they saw he would not come to their Commu∣nion any more. One Woman belonging to the <HI>Eastern</HI> parts, who had by their perswasions, Married an <HI>En∣glish</HI> Captive taken the last War, came away with her Husband, which made them say, they were sor∣ry they ever perswaded her to turn to their Religi∣on, and then to Marry. For instead of advancing their Cause by it, they had weakened it, for now they had not only lost her, but another they thought they had made sure of. Another Woman belong∣ing to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> who had been flattered to their Religion, to whom a Bible was denied, till she pro∣mised to embrace their Religion, and then had the promise of it for a little time, opening her Bible whilst in the Church and present, at Mass, she read the fourth Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> &amp; received such conviction whilst reading, that before her first com∣munion she fell off from them, and could never be prevailed with any more to be of their Religion.</P>

We have reason to bless God, who has wrought deliverance for so many, and yet to pray to God for a door of escape, to be opened for the great number yet behind, not much short of an Hun∣dred, many of which are Children, and of these not a few among the Salvages, and having lost the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Tongue, will be lost and turn Salvages in a little time, unless something extraordinary prevent.</P>
<P>The Vessel that came for us, in its Voyage to <HI>Canada</HI> struck on a Bar of Sands, and there lay in very great hazard for four Tides, and yet they saw reason to bless God for striking there; for had they got over that Bar, they should at midnight in a Storm of Snow have run upon a terrible ledge of Rocks.</P>
<P>We came away from <HI>Quebeck, October</HI> Twenty five, and by contrary Winds and a great Storm, we were retarded, and then driven back nigh the Ci∣ty, and had a great deliverance from Shipwrack, the Vessel striking twice on a Rock in that Storm.

It's certain, that the Charity of the whole Country of <HI>Canada,</HI> though moved with the doct∣rine of merit, does not come up to the Charity of <HI>Boston</HI> alone, where notions of merit are rejected; but acts of Charity performed out of a right Christian Spirit, from a Spirit of thankfulness to God, out of Obedience to Gods Command, and unfeigned Love and Charity to them that are of the same <HI>Family and Houshold of Faith.</HI> The Lord grant, that all who devise such liberal things, may find the accomplishment of the promises made by God, in their own persons and theirs after them, from Ge∣neration to Generation.</P>
<P>I Shall Annex a short account, of the troubles be∣ginning to arise at <HI>Canada.</HI> On <HI>May</HI> Sixteen, arrived a Cannoe at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> that brought Letters from <HI>Mesyppa,</HI> written the <HI>May</HI> preceeding, giving an account that the Plague was there, and that One hundred &amp; Fifty <HI>French</HI> in a very little time had dyed of it; &amp; that the Salvages called the <HI>Lezilouways</HI> were very turbulent, &amp; had with their Arrows wound∣ed a <HI>Jesuit</HI> in Five places, and killed a <HI>French-man</HI> that waited on him. In <HI>July</HI> News came, that the Nations up the River were engaged in a War one against the other, and that the <HI>French</HI> living so among them, and Trading with them,
<PB N="87" REF="001340_0093_0FB28496848F86B8"/>
were in great danger, that the <HI>Mitchel-macquina's</HI> had made War with the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mies,</HI> and had kil∣led a <HI>Mendicant F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yar,</HI> and three other <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and eleven Salvages at a place call'd the <HI>Straits,</HI> where they are settling a Garison and Place for Traffick; <HI>the Mitchel-macquina's</HI> had taken sixteen <HI>French-men</HI> Prisoners, and burnt their Trading Houses. These tidings made the <HI>French</HI> very full of perplexing troubles; but the <HI>Jesuits</HI> are en∣deavouring to pacify them, but the troubles when we came away, were rather encreasing then les∣sening; for the last Letters from the <HI>French</HI> Pri∣soners at <HI>Mitchel-macquina</HI> report, that the Salva∣ges had sent out two Companies, one of an Hundred and Fifty, another of an Hundred and Sixty, against the Salvages at the <HI>Straits,</HI> and they feared, they would engage as well against the <HI>French</HI> as the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

<BIBL>Luke VIII. 39.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Return to thine own House, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee.—</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Infinitely Wise disposer of all things, who aims at His own Glory, in the Go∣verning of Rational Creatures, doth sometimes bring Persons into the depths of distress, and then magnify his Power &amp; Grace in raising them up out of their afflictions: and in many respects by such things, He has a design of ad∣vancing His own Honour &amp; Glory in the World. We find in the context, a Person in a very doleful distress'd condition: he seems to be forsaken of God, and made a Possession and dwelling Place of Evil Spirits, deprived of all humane comforts &amp; delights, made to possess Sorrow and Pain to such a degree, as to be a common Subject, or Theme of discourse for all men to relate doleful things about. And after∣ward, God in very remarkable &amp; wonderful works of Power and Mercy not only gives release from his sorrowful Possession, but he is <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting at the feet of Jesus, cloathed, &amp; in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind.</HI> Now this was done for the declarative and manifestative Glory &amp; Ho∣nour of God. For when this man for whom such great
<PB N="90" REF="001340_0096_0FB2849C7ADBCB78"/>
things had been done, Petitions Christ that he may abide with Him, to hear from Him, and Pay his respects to him; he receives commandment, to be glorifying the Power &amp; Mercy of God, in declaring to others what great things God had done for him.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Subject of great Mercy; or a person spoken of for whom God had done great things, bestowed eminent Mercies.</P>
<P N="2">2. A particular and special command from Christ, to be glorifying God in relating to others, what Mercies he had been the Subject of.</P>
<P N="3">3. His obedience to the great command of Christ: he went and published the great things done for him by Christ; so that from the command of Christ, &amp; his obedience to it, for which he is commended, you may observe this Doctrinal Conclusion.</P>
<Q>DOCT. It well becomes those who have had eminent Mercies, to be shewing to others what Great things GOD has done for them.</Q>
<P>The holy Scriptures in many places confirm this Truth. See Exod. 12. 25, 26, 27. <HI>And it shall come to pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when ye be came to the land, which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. And it shall come to pass, when your Children shall say unto you, What mean you by this service? That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lords Passover, who passed over the Houses of the Children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, &amp; delivered our houses.</HI> Exod. 13. 8, 10. <HI>And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me, when I came
<PB N="91" REF="001340_0097_0FB2849E02E706D8"/>
forth out of Egypt. Thou shalt therefore keep this Ordi∣nance in his season from year to year.</HI> Psal. 78. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 4. <HI>Which we have heard and known, and our Fathers have told us; we will not hide them from their Children, shew∣ing to the Generation to come the Praises of the Lord, and his Strength, &amp; his wonderful works that he hath done.</HI> In the prosecution &amp; handling of this Truth, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. They who have had Mercies, have had them from God. God is the bestower and giver of all our good things: All our Mercies come to us by a Divine Providence, and ordering; not by casualty and accident, neither are they of our own procu∣ring and purchasing, or others, so as to exclude the providential disposing of God. 'Tis God who re∣turns the Captivity of Zion, Psal. 126. <HI>begin. When the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: Then was our mouth filled with laugh∣ter, and our tongue with singing. Then said they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad: turn again our Captivity O Lord.</HI> The very Heathen, acknowledge the good things be∣stowed upon, and done for the Church, to be from God; and Gods own People acknowledge Him for the Mercies granted, and humbly supplicate Mer∣cies from Him for the future. 'Tis God who ga∣thers the out-casts of <HI>Israel:</HI> 'tis He who takes away the Captives of the Mighty, the Prey of the terri∣ble: Who contends with them that contend with us, &amp; saves our Children. 'Tis God who disperseth and gathers again: Therefore the Psalmist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 103. <HI>begin.</HI> Calls upon his Soul to bless the Lord,
<PB N="92" REF="001340_0098_0FB284A20DA33218"/>
and not to forget all his benefits; and saith, 'tis God <HI>who forgiveth all thy iniquities, who heal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th all thy dis∣cases: Who redeemeth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies,</HI> &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sometimes, God in a more immediate and ex∣traordinary way and manner, confers blessings and mercies, sometimes in a more ordinary and medi∣ate way; but his Providence is to be acknowledged in all: not one single Mercy comes to us, without a commission from that God by whom our very Hairs are numbred.</P>
<P N="2">2. It well becomes those who have had eminent Mercies, to be showing to others what great things God hath done for them. Therefore you find the holy Psalmist calling upon others, to give a listning ear, whilst he makes a Narration of the Salvations he had from God, Psal. 66.16. <HI>Come and hear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st. Reason.</HI> Because God aimed at the advance∣ment of His Own Honour and Glory, in the giving and dealing out of these Mercies. God makes and disposeth all things for His own Honour and Glory. All Works of Providence, are some way or other to advance the Honour &amp; Glory of God in the World. The glory of His Power, Wisdom, Mercy, Justice and Holiness, are some way or other advanced in a declarative and manifestative way and manner. Now it well becomes us, to fall in with the design of God, and in an active manner to be giving Him Glory. That God designs to have Glory given to Him, is evident from, Psal. 50. 15. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="93" REF="001340_0099_0FB284A403EFD3E8"/>
in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</HI> Exod. 7.5. <HI>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the Children of Israel from among them.</HI> God has a design to magnify His Power, Mercy and Covenant Faithfulness, in the eyes of the World.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d. Reas.</HI> Because God has given us direct pre∣cepts, and positive Commands, in this Way to be Glo∣rifying of Him. <HI>God is our Lord and Law-giver,</HI> and He requires that among other ways of showing forth His Praises, we do it by rehearsing His Praise wor∣thy Acts, to the Children of Men. So that in O∣bedience to God, and answering that High &amp; No∣ble end we were made for; its requisite that in this way we glorify God. Its enough, that the great God who hath taken us into <HI>Covenant Relation</HI> to Himself, has enjoyned us, to shew forth His Praises in rehearsing to others the Salvations, and Favours we have been the Subjects of. The fore-mentioned Scriptures, with many others that might be enume∣rated, sufficiently demonstrate, that God calls for our thankful acknowledgments in this Way; and upon the account of this being so agreeable to the revealed and preceptive Will of God, the Psalmist expresseth himself, as in Psal. 145.4, 5, 6. <HI>One Gene∣ration shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy Majesty; and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness: and shall sing of thy Righte∣ousness.</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="001340_0100_0FB28072BAD21EE8"/>
Verse 10, 11, 12. <HI>All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy Saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom; and talk of thy power. To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d. Reas.</HI> Because hereby they will stir up others to bless God with them, and for them. A truly gracious Soul finds by experience, that he can do but a little in Glorifying God, finds how far he falls short of the rule of duty, in so reasonable a Service as Glorifying God. And being enlarged in desires that the glory due to God might be given Him, doth call upon others to joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with him in this Heavenly Service of Praising God; and therefore tells them what great things God has done. <HI>Psal.</HI> 34. 2, 3, 4, 6. <HI>My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together. I sought the Lord, and he heard me; and delivered me from all my fears. This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him; and saved him out of all his troubles.</HI> When <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> told his Father in law <HI>Jethro,</HI> the great things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had done for <HI>Israel,</HI> he Glorifies God on their behalf, Exod. 18. 8. <HI>&amp;c. And Moses told his Father in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israels sake, and all the travel that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them. And Jethro rejoyced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel: whom he had delivered ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the hand of the Egyptians. And Jethro said, Blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Praraoh, who hath
<PB N="95" REF="001340_0101_0FB28077F1F3A4B8"/>
delivered the people from under the hand of the Egypti∣ans. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them.</HI> By this means thanks will be given to God by many: as many have been Praying to God for them, so many will be praising and blessing God with them and for them.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th. Reas.</HI> Because hereby they will oftentimes be advised and counselled, how to improve such Mercies to the Glory of God. We are conscious to our selves of so much blindness, ignorance, and darkness, that we can't but own it a great thing to be in a way for the best counsel, what to do with our Mercies, and what and how to return to God for them. Now the publishing the great things done by God for us, put others in a capacity to be advising and telling of us, what temptations we may expect to meet with, and what will be needful on our part to avoid temptations, and how to over-come; they will be counselling us, how to be in a way, of rendring to the Lord according to the benefits done unto us: what Duties God looks for the performance of, and directions how to do duty. In a word, we may be counsel'd how to order our whole Conversation, so as God may have Glory, and our good purposes of honouring and glorifying God with our Mercies, established. <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 20. 18. <HI>Every purpose is established by counsel.</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> had told <HI>Jethro</HI> what great things God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> done for Israel, he saith, Exod. 18, 19. <HI>Heathen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with thee,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="96" REF="001340_0102_0FB2807AA9CB18C0"/>
5<HI>th. Reas.</HI> Because hereby they will be instrumental to put others upon trusting God, making Him their hope and refuge in an Evil Day. Others will be excited, to a seeking refuge under the shadow of his Wings, Psal. 44. beg. <HI>We have heard with our ears; O God, our fathers have told us, what work then didst in their days, in the times of old. How thou didst drive out the Heathen, &amp;c.</HI> And then it is said, <HI>Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. Thro' thee will we push down our enemies: through thy Name will we tread them under that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. In God we boast all the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g.</HI> Others that have heard, will say, such and such an one was thus ex∣ercised, and God appeared for them, and put songs of praise to the Lord into their mouths, we will commit our Case to God too; we will both hope and quietly wait for Gods Salvation too. Your telling others, how you have found God a Prayer-hearing God, will encourage them, Prayer-wise to be committing their distressed &amp; difficult cases to Him. What an honour to be instrumental to any Souls comfort, and Gods honour; agreeable to this is that, Psal. 78. 5, 6, 7. <HI>Which he commanded our fa∣thers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they should make them known to their Chil∣dren. That the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which should be born: who should arise and declare them to their children: That they might set their hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, and not forget the works of God: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th. Reas.</HI> Because the Works of God towards them, have been very wonderful. The Psalmist often
<PB N="97" REF="001340_0103_0FB2807BC1CB80D0"/>
speaks of the Works of God as marvellous; they are wonderful if we consider, how God <HI>Timed</HI> the Mercy; when their feet well nigh slipt, when they could see no way of escape; as with the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> at the Red-sea. How very wonderful and marvellous was the work of God, in putting by the wicked purpose of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man</HI> against <HI>Mordeca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and the Jews? If we consider how God kept from fal∣ling, by making them pass a right judgment on their ways and His ways, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. Yea appearing to save them, when with <HI>Jonah</HI> they were saying. <HI>They were cast out of Gods sight.</HI> All refuge seemed to fail, none shewing any care for their soul; even then God made good his word on which he had caused them to hope, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 142. <HI>per totum.</HI> The Works of God are marvellous, if we consider the way and manner of ushering in the mercy, the instrument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that were made use of, and how He disappointed the counsels of the Crafty.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>th. Reas.</HI> Because 'tis a good evidence, that they regarded and took notice of the Works of God in Mercy, and would not forget His wonderful works towards them. For hereby, they put others under advantages to put them in mind, what favours they have received from God.</P>

receiver to report, it layes the hearer under an ob∣ligation, to set such remarks upon the passages of Divine Providence to others, as may be useful to engage their hearts to Glorify God, for the favours and blessings He has bestowed upon others. And therefore in obedience to Gods Command, that you may be under advantages to Glorify God; I will now make a report, of some of the great things God has done for those, you have been putting up so many Prayers to God for. God has eminently been fulfilling that Word, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 46. <HI>He made them also to be pitied, of all those that carried them Captives.</HI></P>
<P>God hath made such whose Characters have been; that they were such whose tender Mercies were Cruelties; such from whom, one act of pity and compassion could scarce be expected, even such who have delighted in cruelty; to pity &amp; compas∣sionate such who were led into Captivity by them. Made them bear on their Arms, and carry on their Shoulders our <HI>Little Ones,</HI> unable to Travel. Feed their Prisoners with the best of their Provision: Yea, sometimes pinch themselves, as to their daily food, rather than their Captives. To pity them under Sickness, and afford all proper means for the restoration of their Health, or recovery from Lameness. Made Heathens bowels earn towards poor Infants exposs'd to Death, so as to Work out their deliverance from fatal strokes, by burdening of themselves. Oh! let us adore the riches of the Grace of God, <HI>who in wrath rememb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs Mercy, and doth not stir up all His wrath;</HI> and from hence be en∣couraged, when under convictions of Gods being
<PB N="99" REF="001340_0105_0FB2807EC3244E58"/>
angry with us, yet look to Him for Mercy.</P>
<P>God has upheld many poor Souls under all man∣ner of disadvantages, as to a getting of Knowledge, and kept them from falling, though crafty Adver∣saries were under all advantages, and painful en∣deavours to seduce them. Being without <HI>Bibles, Ministers,</HI> or <HI>Christian Friends</HI> to confer with, daily harrased with Temptations, and Tempters: Some threatned, some flattered, some shut up and confi∣ned in Monasteryes, where no means were unessay∣ed to gain them to change their Religion.</P>
<P>God has strengthened to go through tedious Journeys, and renewed strength, when they were even fainting in their Spirits▪ thinking it not pos∣sible to Travel Five Miles, and yet enabled to Tra∣vel at least Forty in a day. Remarkably ordering seasons, so as to be for their comfort in their Travels; causing a Moist Snow to fall on the Lake, only to such a height as to make it easy to their Swoln and Wounded feet: Changing the Winds for their ad∣vantages, in petty Voyages in their ticklish Can∣noes.</P>
<P>They have found God a little Sanctuary to them, in the Land of Strangers; even there have found the Consolations of God through Christ not to be small; so that some of the most joyful and refreshing fa∣vours from Heaven, have been given in to their Souls, when under all sorts of outward afflictions.</P>
<P>They have found God a God hearing Prayers, when they have gone to Him with their most diffi∣cult cases, preserving them from falling; recover∣ing theirs from falls; to a making void the counsels
<PB N="100" REF="001340_0106_0FB28080F8F94FD8"/>
of Adversaries, disappointing of them in the things they dealt most Proudly in. God has brought His to a resignation to His Will, and then appeared deal∣ing out Mercies, as the very case did require.</P>
<P>God has Sanctified to some, their former <HI>Sabbath</HI> solemn attendances on Duties of Piety, Private as well as Publick; and a Religious Education to be an unanswerable Objection, against such who were zealous for the <HI>Traditions of Men,</HI> to a visible Pro∣phaning Gods Sabbaths. They durst not embrace that Religion whose Principles as well as Practises, were so contrary to the Precepts of Gods holy Word. Oh! how should <HI>Ministers,</HI> and <HI>Parents</HI> be encou∣raged from hence to use their utmost care, that Gods Sabbaths may be duely Sanctified by all under their charge; and that they would be exemplary before others, in a due observance of Holy Time.</P>
<P>God has made the falls of some to <HI>Popery,</HI> a means for the recovery of others; and making those things, by which the adversary thought to encrease their numbers and proselytes, to be occasional of recovering such who from their youth had been educated in the <HI>Popish</HI> way; having been taken Captives when young. Don't be discouraged and say, your Friends and Relations have (being Cap∣tivated when young) for a long time lived in <HI>Po∣pery,</HI> and therefore no hopes of recovery; for God can make dry bones, very dry to live, and can in ways unthought of by you, both recover them after they have fallen, and return them again. The Adversaries have sometimes, pretended mira∣cles for the confirmation of their Religion, that
<PB N="101" REF="001340_0107_0FB28081D744AE28"/>
they might seduce to Popery; in fallacious ways caused reports that some Captives dyed <HI>Papists;</HI> that one appeared in <HI>Flames of Fire</HI> to bear a testi∣mony against the <HI>Protestant Religion;</HI> but God has in his wise Providence, made known their falshoods and lyes.</P>
<P>They have sought to perswade some, by Sums of Mony to change their Religion, offering honour and advancement to them at the same time; but God has enabled to resist and hate such allure∣ments.</P>
<P>The reading the fourth Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> a means of recovering one from <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>God has made some with an heroical, yea with a right Christian Courage to welcome Death. Oh let every one get such a preparedness for DEATH, that a sudden DEATH may not be a terror!</P>
<P>God has made some by the want of Sanctuary Mercies, to set an higher value upon the Ordinan∣ces of JESUS CHRIST. Oh learn to prize, and improve them, lest God teach you by the briars and thorns of the Wilderness, the worth of them, and weep when you set down at the Rivers of <HI>Ba∣bylon.</HI></P>
<P>God has strengthened some to stand, when they have not only been threatned with all cruelties if they refused, but when the Hatchet has been lift up, with a threatning of speedy death in case of refusal. Oh let every one trust in God, who is a seasonable help and a present refuge!</P>

How soon are mercies like to be forgotten; the Psalmist says, <HI>Forget not all his Benefits.</HI> It was the great sin of the <HI>Isr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elites</HI> of old, that they soon forgat Gods wondrous works. The Holy God gave order, that his People should Erect Stones of remembrance, that his Wonderful Works of Mercy to his Peo∣ple might not be forgotten; yea, commanded Pa∣rents to tell their Children, from Generation to Generation, what great things he had done for them. How are they then to blame that say, <HI>They bless God for their Mercies,</HI> and don't rehearse the Praise▪ worthy Works of Divine Providence to o∣thers.</P>

<HEAD>USE II.</HEAD>
<P>To direct such, who have received great and eminent Mercies from God, in this way of making known to others the wonders of mercy to them, to be praising God. It's one way very proper and agreeable to the revealed Will of God: You must watch against all vain Ostentation.</P>

<HEAD>USE III. Of EXHORTATION.</HEAD>
<P>To all who have in a more peculiar way and manner, been casting off the effects and fruits of

Divine Bounty and Goodness, to be declaring what great things God has done for them.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. Beware of all manner of Pride. Sometimes men can't declare the Great Works of God done for them, without making known their own weak∣ness, and therefore are silent, and hold their peace, they had rather God should lose his Glory, then they any of their credit or esteem. But the holy Psalmist says, <HI>His feet had well nigh slipt;</HI> yea, <HI>that in his haste he had said, all men are liars;</HI> and that one day he should surely perish: takes shame to himself, that he might magnify the preventing and delivering grace and goodness of God. Some∣times mens <HI>Pride</HI> makes them so admire their own parts and contrivances, as to overlook the Works of Divine Providence; they <HI>sacrifice to their own net, and burn incense to their own drag;</HI> and say they had so much <HI>Learning</HI> &amp; <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that they could easily answer arguments to seduce them to <HI>Popery;</HI> and so don't see and acknowledge the goodness of God, in preserving and keeping of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Beware of a <HI>stupid, senseless, slothful Spirit. The works of God are sought out of them that have pleasure in them.</HI> Some won't be at the pains to recollect the passages of Divine Providence; won't commit them to writing, or to their memo∣ries, and therefore soon forget them; they never wisely observe the heightning circumstances of their Mercies.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="001340_0110_0FB2808D6ADD3888"/>
<HI>Consider,</HI> 3. How Heavenly an Employ &amp; Service it is, to be Glorifying and Praising God. It will be one part of the work of Heaven, to be telling of the wonderful Works of God towards us. Be∣gin such an Heavenly Employ on Earth. Hereby you will also interest your selves in the <HI>Prayers</HI> of others; to have many Prayers going daily to God for you, how great a favour is it! Others hearing what Mercies you have had, will bear you upon their hearts when at a Throne of Grace, that you may suitably improve such mercies.</P>
<P>The Glorifying God, is the greatest and chiefest concern of gracious Souls; and the Glorifying of God here, is the way to be Glorifyed by, and with God for ever. The not Glorifying God is very displeasing to Him, and a way to deprive our selves of the sweet and comfort of our Mercies. God accounts forgetting of <HI>Mercies,</HI> a forgetting <HI>Himself.</HI></P>
