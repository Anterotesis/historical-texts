<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE <HI>been a reader of the useful publications for children with which the world abounds, till I feel my∣self inspired with emulation, to devote my own leisure hours to the same benevolent purpose, that so properly em∣ploys the pens of many of my sex. The ladies who are already engaged in furnishing a succession of books, fit for children in their</HI> early <HI>years, seem to stand in no need of an auxiliary; being possessed, both of talents, and indus∣try, equal to their laudable undertaking; nor do I wish to invade their province; but, as I observe, that these respectable writers content themselves with conducting their pupils to a cerain period; I think I may with pro∣priety</HI> follow <HI>them, and offer some hints to young ladies preparatory to (what they are too apt to regard as the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of liberty) the time of their leaving school; when numbers of unexperienced young persons suppose them∣selves capable of forming just opinions of people and things, and of regulating their own conduct.</HI></P>
<P><HI>With a view of preventing, in some degree, this impro∣per</HI> SELF-CONFIDENCE, <HI>which naturally produces pride, impatient of controul, and various other intellectual de∣formities, I have projected a design of presenting to the public, a few domestic scenes; calculated to shew, the happy effects of</HI> filial affection, sweetness of temper, <HI>and</HI> steadiness of mind, <HI>when exercised in the</HI> season of YOUTH, <HI>towards either</HI> good <HI>or</HI> bad <HI>parents.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Were all persons to discharge their duty to their offs∣pring, it would be</HI> unjust <HI>to exhibit, even fictitious cha∣racters of parents in an unamiable light; and it certainly is commendable, in every one concerned in the education of children, to throw a veil over the imperfections of those, whom nature and religion require to be honored and obey∣ed. But it must be acknowledged and lamended, that many parents indulge themselves in faults, which are
<PB N="iv" REF="023336_0003_0FBEFF1474C458B8"/>
productive of much unhappiness to their families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faults, which they an nor strive to</HI> hide, <HI>and are therefore</HI> una∣voidably <HI>discovered to their children; as soon as they are permitted to</HI> dwell <HI>under the paternal roof, from whence they are almost totally excluded, till they are old enough to distinguish characters: the effect of this is, that many an</HI> amiable <HI>girl, when she returns from school, where she has been accustomed to practise regularity, and receive good instruction, is continually at a loss how to act at home, where she sees nothing but</HI> idleness, dissipation, passion <HI>and</HI> fretfulness; <HI>and consequently through the insinuations of servants, or the inconsiderate a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of</HI> young <HI>friends, may be induced to think that she is</HI> excusable <HI>for omit∣ting to pay attention and obedience to these, who neglect to act a parent's part. Would it not, therefore, be a be∣nevolent office, in those who superintend the education of</HI> female <HI>youth in particular,</HI> prudently <HI>to prepare them for the conflicts they may be engaged in, by strongly inculca∣ting the duty of a daughter in its almost extent; and en∣forcing a per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion that their felicity principally depends on rectitude of their</HI> own <HI>conduct; that they may be for∣tified to bear, with dutiful submission, the many evils which the improper behavior of</HI> bad <HI>parents may expose them to; or learn to feel the comforts of their situation, of they are blessed with</HI> good <HI>ones?</HI></P>
<P>SECOND MARRIAGES, <HI>though in many cases highly expedient, are frequently productive of family discord; for children are usually, by some means or other, preju∣diced against a mother-in-law; and disinclined to obey or respect her. I have therefore fixed on this as the sub∣ject of the present Volume; and have adapted the</HI> drama∣tic style, <HI>as most likely to engage attention.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the first of the following little pieces I have attempt∣ed to shew</HI> what kind of behavior is most likely to pro∣duce harmony, where all parties have good sense and good dispositions: <HI>and in the second to point out,</HI> that affection for a parent should guard young minds from revolting against him, even should he form a disagreea∣ble connection.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="023336_0004_0FBEFF15EE573C48"/>
<HI>If my labors are honored with the approbation of the public, I shall pursue my plan, with the hope, that the les∣sons I inculcate may be conducive towards establishing such habits of</HI> patience, meekness <HI>and</HI> complacency, <HI>as are essentially necessary to render young ladies</HI> happy in themselves, <HI>and to qualify them for the discharge of the various duties, which particularly belong to the</HI> FEMALE CHARACTER.</P>

<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE, a Room in Mrs. Sutton's House.</HEAD>
<STAGE>[<HI>Enter Mr. and Mrs.</HI> Sutton.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELCOME! my dear Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> to this house, once the abode of your beloved friend; by your kind compliance with her dying request, that you would supply to her dear children the loss of a tender parent, you have restored peace to my long afflicted bosom, and engaged my warmest gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, sir, the sincerity of your profession; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y frequent residence in your house, during the life of my most valued friend, convinced me of your merit, and you were long in possession of my esteem, I there∣fore gladly accepted your hand, and will endeavor to imitate, as much as possible, the character of her, whose memory is as dear to me as to yourself.—But where are the dear children? I long to fold them to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! madam, you know not the arduous talk you have undertaken; for some months before her death, <HI>So∣phia</HI> had been obliged to remit her usual attention to them; she perceived the unhappy effects of her invo∣luntary neglect, and her last hours were embittered
<PB N="8" REF="023336_0006_0FBEFF1902F2A768"/>
apprehensions, that the faults she perceived arising in their tempers would encrease for want of proper ma∣nagement. Whilst I beheld her languishing with sick∣ness, I could not myself attend to their instruction; and the fatal stroke which deprived me of her for ever, totally disqualified me for domestic duties; all I could do, was, to weep over my children. But I now re∣solve to banish unavailing sorrow, and be again a fa∣ther. I will immediately introduce them to you, and may they improve the happy advantage I have pro∣cured them! but I fear your reception will not be very agreeable, as I understand, since my return, that my elder daughters are greatly displeased at my mar∣riage. I thought to give them an agreeable surprize, by bringing you home as their mother, as they were once so affectionately attached to you.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Mr.</HI> Sutton <HI>goes out.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I foresee, from Mr. <HI>Sutton's</HI> account of his young fa∣mily, that I shall have many difficulties to encounter; I am sorry to hear that he did not make his elder daugh∣ters acquainted with his intentions. However, I will think of dear <HI>Sophia,</HI> and endeavor to acquit myself like a real parent, for her sake. All ceremonial visits shall be deferred till I have attended to this important concern.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Enter Mr.</HI> Sutton, <HI>introducing Miss</HI> Fanny, <HI>Miss</HI> Ca∣roline, <HI>and Master</HI> William. <HI>The elder ladies appear reluctant to approach Mrs.</HI> Sutton.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Receive from my hands, my dear Mrs. <HI>Sutton, Isabella</HI> and <HI>Fanny;</HI> I hope they have not forgot your former kindness, and will be happy to shew you duty and af∣fection.</P>

<P>Have you forgot me my dears? Do not you remem∣ber

her how fond I used to be of you? I have the same sentiments for you as formerly, and I will be a kind mamma to you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! my dear <HI>own</HI> mamma, I wish you were alive!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>That wish, my love, must be suppressed. It was the Divine will to take her from us; she is, I trust, in a state of happiness, and we must resign ourselves to the loss of her. I have provided you a new mamma▪ one, who I am sure loves you; and if you treat her with duty and respect, she will be as attentive to your im∣provement as your own mamma would have been.—But retire at present; I will not blame you for this tribute of tears, due to the remembrance of so tender a parent. Reflect on the blessing I have procured for you, and endeavor to rejoice with me, that the dear friend of your departed mother, now supplies her place in my family.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Miss</HI> Sutton <HI>and Miss</HI> Fanny <HI>go out.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Caroline</HI> and <HI>William!</HI> why do not you run to your new mamma? I thought you would be glad to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! no, papa; <HI>Mary</HI> says, we shall never be happy now we have got a mother-in-law; and though I lov∣ed Mrs. <HI>Greenhill,</HI> and liked she should come to see us when poor mamma was alive, I am sure I shall never love her now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master William.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say, my mamma-in-law will never let me have any play-things, and I shall not be permitted to run about in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, my dear children, can have put such strange notions into your heads? However, we will talk of this another time. Try your new mamma; ask her
<PB N="10" REF="023336_0008_0FBEFF1BF97FD940"/>
to let you go into the garden.—What I both silent? Why, <HI>Caroline,</HI> she has brought you the nicest doll I ever saw; but I think you must not have it, as you behave so ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! yes, Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> I must have the pleasure of presenting it to her now; we shall soon understand each other better: and to convince Master <HI>William</HI> that I have no intention to shut him up in the house, as he apprehends, I will not only permit him to go out to play, but provide him with the means of amusing himself. Here, sir, Will you accept these nine pins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! what a sweet doll! will you, <HI>new</HI> mamma, be kind to me indeed? Well, I will not mind <HI>Mary.</HI>—What a sweet doll? Come, doll, I am your new mamma!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master William.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say I can knock down four of these nine-pins at once. Do, pray, papa, open the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kiss your mamma first, and I will. You, <HI>Caroline,</HI> may take your child, and shew it to your sisters. De∣sire the maid to bring down <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<STAGE>[Caroline <HI>and</HI> William <HI>go out.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry the dear children are so much set against me. However, a little time and patience will put these matters to rights.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am concerned, my dear madam, at the thoughts of the task you will have; but I will do my part towards removing the unhappy prejudices which my children have unaccountably imbibed. Here comes one, who surely has not yet received any wrong impression.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Sutton [<HI>Aside to Mr.</HI> Sutton.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not, Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> force the child to come to me; let him stay till he is done crying, and when he has ex∣amined my countenance and finds nothing terrific in it, he will perhaps be ready to come to me. Send the nursery-maid away, and take him yourself.</P>
<P><HI>Nanny,</HI> leave <HI>Charles</HI> here; he shall stay with <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! pray, sir, let Master <HI>Charles</HI> go with <HI>me; I</HI> can quiet him in a minute. Poor little dear! <HI>It</HI> will break <HI>its</HI> little heart if you cross him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave him this instant! I guess how you will quiet him; by indulging his perverseness, and telling him, I suppose, that papa is naughty.</P>
<STAGE><HI>The</HI> Maid <HI>goes out.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Thus it is that servants who are hired for assistants, ruin the tempers of children; and so give us more trouble than they save.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you shall not go to your new mamma; you shall come to me, <HI>Charles;</HI> and instead of crying after <HI>Nenny,</HI> tell me, whether you should like to see <HI>William</HI> play at nine-pins? His new mamma hat given him some very pretty ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Master Charles</HI> [<HI>Ceases crying.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<P>O! dear, let me see the nine-pins! Will my new mamma give <HI>me</HI> some?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, I dare say she will, when you are a good boy. She sent for you to give you a little chaise; but if you will not go to her, you will never have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do new mammas <HI>give</HI> play-things? I thought they <HI>took them away.</HI></P>

<P>Now, mamma, pray give me the chaise.</P>

<P>In the afternoon I expect <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>George</HI> from school; I have desired their master to spare them from their studies for one day, that they may pay their res∣pects to you; but from the specimen you have had of your children-in-law, madam, you cannot much wish for the interview.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ladies, they are the vilest people in the world; if folks have been ever so good <HI>before,</HI> as soon as they are mothers-in-law, they grow hard-hearted directly. I am quite certain that Mrs. <HI>Sutton</HI> has set my master against poor little <HI>Charles</HI> already; for do you know, ladies, that for all the dear child cried as if he would break his heart to come to me, and I begged, as if I was begging for my life, that I might take him, my master would not let him?

<P>No, don't; for she will think I put it in your head. I have had one scolding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout you already; but if ever you tell a tale of me, I won't love you any more.

<P>It is indeed! Now we shall never have a will of our

own; we must always be starch and prim, and shall have no pleasure in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Miss, that you won't. I knew a mother-in-law who half starved her children, and shut them quite up from company, and made them learn hard tasks, and would never let them go out. But, if I were you, I would never submit; and when Mrs. <HI>Sutton</HI> finds you don't mind her, she'll let you do as you please; be∣sides, your papa ought to be punished for marrying again.</P>

<P>O, Miss, I can tell you. My new mistress has to coax them, given Miss <HI>Caroline</HI> a fine doll, and Master <HI>William</HI> a set of nine-pins; he is playing with them in the garden, and she is in the little parlour diverting herself with her new baby. I left them below, be∣cause I thought we could have no chat if they were by, for they are old enough to tell tales. For my part, I never will live nursery maid again where there are children who can talk. When the poor little dears are in <HI>arms</HI> there is pleasure in nursing them; for if a friend, or one's sweetheart comes, one can toss them into a cradle, or tie them in a chair, and if they cry, a lump of sugar will pacify them. But I shall <HI>have it</HI> if I leave Master <HI>William</HI> and Miss <HI>Caroline</HI> any longer. [<HI>A bell rings.</HI>] Bless me! madam rings her bell I protest.</P>

<P>It is not my wish, Miss <HI>Sutton,</HI> to lay any unreason∣able restraint upon you; and I am sure a young lady of your good sense will distinguish what is intended for your benefit.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much as it distresses me, to see your merit thus slighted, I will suppress my anger.—My dear girls! behold me softened by the kind interposition of that very friend whom you so unworthily contemn: be∣lieve me, the heart of your own dear mother was not adorned with more lovely qualities than fall to the share of this amiable lady. Though I had the sincer∣est esteem for Mrs. <HI>Greenhill,</HI> who supplies her place, I never should have thought of a second marriage but for your sakes; and since she has condescended to leave a delightful retreat, and sacrificed ease to friendship. I will not have her life made unhappy by the perverse∣ness of any of you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton (greatly disturbed.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely there is a general combination amongst my children to distress their father.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had no occasion, papa, to say any thing to my bro∣thers; they have other friends to advice them besides us; and nobody can wonder that children, who have been so long indulged, should be averse to such restraint as will now fall to our share.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you already forgot, <HI>Bell,</HI> that I enjoined you not to repeat your impertinence?</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Sutton</HI> said, Sir, that we might withdraw. We long to see our brothers, but would not go without <HI>your</HI> leave. I am sure I do not wish to be disobedient to <HI>you.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> you take up this mat∣ter too seriously. I know that the elder ladies have naturally good dispositions, but their minds have long been uncultivated, and therefore ill habits have sprung up, I hope they are not deeply rooted. But let us proceed with gentleness and caution, "lest <HI>in pluck∣ing up the tares, we root up the wheat also."</HI> It is an ill compliment to you, for me already to request your ab∣sence; but if you will find engagements for to-mor∣row, I will try what I can do by myself. Let me ob∣tain your permission to discharge the nursery-maids, for I am certain we shall not thoroughly succeed till they are gone; my own woman will do what is neces∣sary for the younger children, till I can hire other servants; and her task will not be difficult, for I pro∣pose to keep them as much as possible under my own eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent woman! now do your virtues rise upon me! Pursue your own plans, I will cheerfully co-ope∣rate with you in them; but find it difficult to restrain my anger at such perverseness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me beg you to leave Master <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>George</HI> to follow their own inclinations.—I have an idea that the hopes of a piece of apple-pie will attract them in the parlor, if love for me will not. Send the footman, therefore, to tell them that they may sit up to supper if they please, but leave it to their own choice. I will not frighten them with my looks, if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve your scheme; and am convinced that gentle methods are the most likely to be attended with
<PB N="21" REF="023336_0019_0FBEFF365E755918"/>
success.—O! how my heart longs for the day, when I can see my beloved family surrounding me with con∣tented minds and cheerful countenances. I will to∣morrow breakfast with Mr. <HI>Steady,</HI> and take my two elder boys with me; for in their present disposition, my family will be better dispersed than collected.—You will, I fear, have enough to do with the girls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I may succeed better than you expect; re∣member, that they had good principles once instilled into their minds; those cannot, I think, be totally ex∣tinguished: but let my task prove ever so difficult, res∣pect to you, and the memory of SOPHIA, will fortify my mind with patience to endure it.—No child of her's shall have just reason to accuse me of unkindness. The young ones are more than half subdued already; another day will, I think, win them to me; and if I once engage their affections, I will not easily suffer them to be estranged from me; and I have no doubt, but that Miss <HI>Sutton</HI> and Miss <HI>Fanny</HI> will give such vo∣luntary testimony in my favor, when their brothers come home next time, that they will no longer fly my presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart cannot so easily admit the pleasing hopes you kindly endeavor to inspire me with, though I have the highest idea of both your goodness and your under∣standing.—But I will see what is become of my ungra∣cious sons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time I will inspect the domestic oeconomy of the house.—Happy shall I be to retain your own servants, if I find them deserving of your favor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear there is not one among them who is worthy of being retained; for there seems to have been a cabal among them to consult their mutual interests, without the least regard to mine.</P>

<P>BELIEVE me, <HI>Simpson,</HI> I have not done any thing more painful to myself a great while, than warn∣ing Mr. Sutton's servants to leave their places; many unkind censures will be passed on me by the world, as I shall put my own in their stead.

<P>"There was a young lady who had a number of brothers and sisters, with whom she might have lived very happily; but she was of so impatient a temper, that she was never pleased unless she had her own way. She did not, as she ought to have done, consider that there was more real pleasure to be found in obliging her brothers and sisters, than in consulting her own will in every thing; but because she was the <HI>eldest,</HI> she insisted upon their complying with all her humors; at length they were obliged to complain to their papa and mamma, who made this little girl live in a distant part of the house, where all her playthings were carried to her; but she was not permitted to see her brothers and sisters. At first she was pleased with the thought, that she should have nobody to contradict her; but in a very short time, she found herself so dull without their company, that she was glad to promise to behave well to them, in order to get leave to return to the nursery; and ever afterwards was as ready to oblige them as they were to please her."</P>

<P>Your answer is not so polite, Miss <HI>Sutton,</HI> as I should have expected from a young lady, who seems to fancy she stand, in no need of tuition. I meant not to act the part of a governess, but of a friend.</P>

<P>From your silence, ladies, I perceive you are able to account for this disaster.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You delight me, ladies; thus may we ever live to∣gether!—I remember, Miss <HI>Sutton,</HI> that you had a taste for fancy work; I shall be glad of your opinion of a piece I have lately finished.</P>
<STAGE>[She produces a piece of embroidery.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, how beautiful! I never beheld any thing so like natural flowers in my life, and the vase is charm∣ing. I shall never bear my own work after this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very happy to give you any instruction in my power, my dear. I am provided with all materi∣als, and you shall, if you please, begin a companion for it; in the mean time do me the favour to accept of this as a token of friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I return you many thanks, madam, and accept with pleasure both your present and kind offer to instruct me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Miss <HI>Fanny,</HI> you have a taste for reading? I have brought down a few new publications, which I hope you will admit into your library.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are extremely obliging, Madam. I have not lately been very attentive to my books, for indeed pa∣pa has not purchased any new ones this year past, and I have read the old ones till I am tired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take care that you are supplied for the future▪ Do you read <HI>French</HI> ladies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="023336_0040_0FC602F5E81F7048"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a <HI>French</HI> master, Madam, who regularly attends to teach us the grammar rules; and we can write and translate tolerably well—but for talking, we cannot boast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, <HI>Bell,</HI> we ought not, as you say, to boast; for both of us made a resolution that we never would speak a word of it when our master was absent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You could not speak it with much advantage to each other, perhaps I may be able to make it more pleasing to you; I resided near two years in <HI>Paris.</HI> It is particularly agreeable to understand <HI>French,</HI> be∣cause there are so many pleasing books in that lan∣guage continually coming out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall like to talk it when I have a person to correct my faults; but to chatter it, as I hear many young la∣dies do, is quite ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you a music master still, ladies? I remember when very little you could sing prettily; if you have made such proficiency as I expect, we shall be able to form a little concert now and then. I suppose you have friends in the neighbourhood who play? Mr. <HI>Adderly</HI> was a very fine performer: is he among you still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; but we must apply more closely than we have done lately, or I am sure we shall make sad discord; our master's music is so very old fashioned, that we play the same d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll tune over till we are tired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be able to furnish you with a variety of lessons. I hope his evening to hear you practise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, for my part, do the best I can; but I fear <HI>that</HI> will appear horrid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="023336_0041_0FC602F7AC72FB88"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, no; it will give me pleasure, I dare say. How often does your dancing master attend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no dancing master at present, Madam, for papa would not suffer us to dance whilst we were in mourning for poor mamma! but he talked lately of sending for him again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will remind him of it. Dancing is very good for the health, and I think it will be very agreeable to have a little ball sometimes, if we can make up a set; for I prefer private parties to public assemblies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have never yet been at a public assembly. My dear mamma thought us too young to be introduced, and since her death papa has not been himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am excessively fond of dancing. There are young ladies and gentlemen sufficient to make up eight or nine couple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dears, as soon as my ceremonial visits are over, and I have been introduced to your neighbors, I will consult you about proposing a party. I hope you will be with me, ladies, when I receive company, and also when I return my visits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Madam, if you will allow us the honor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very happy to make you a party in every pleasure I take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a very agreeable neighbourhood, and, as you seem inclined to be sociable, Madam, I dare say we shall pass our time very cheerfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no doubt but you will; at least I can an∣swer
<PB N="44" REF="023336_0042_0FC602F91A4DF2A0"/>
for my own intentions, to promote innocent cheer∣fulness as much as possible. But, as I am very fond of regularity, ladies, I must beg leave to propose a little plan for the usual division of our time: early rising is of the utmost consequence, for nothing can be done ef∣fectually without that; I have always been accustomed to family prayers, after which, I hope, you will find an hour before breakfast for walking, if the weather per∣mit; it is my wish that all assemble at eight o'clock, and after breakfast is over I shall attend to domestic arrangements; in the mean time I hope you will apply to your various studies, and by ten o'clock I shall be at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will conform to whatever you think proper, Madam: I answer for my sister as well as myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must declare my own assent also: for I would not give my dear mamma cause to think I would be again refractory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall endeavor to make your compliance productive of as much pleasure to you, my dears, as it will to me. You find that I do not mean to confine your entirely to your studies and work; besides those amusements I mentioned, I shall be ready to allow of your visiting and being visited by the young ladies of your acquaint∣ance without me, provided they are such as your papa approves of.—You do not play at cards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Fanny.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My own dear mamma had such an aversion to cards, that she never would allow us to touch them; and since her death papa absolutely forbade them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I must own that we were not perfectly obedient to him in this particular, for the nursery maids brought cards to us, and, I blush to say, we joined in a party with <HI>them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="45" REF="023336_0043_0FC602FBE35A04B0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Since you are so sensible of its impropriety; I will not speak my own thoughts on the subject. But, let me intreat you, ladies, to avoid familiarity with low▪ bred people, particularly the domestics of your own fa∣mily. It will be more prejudicial to you than you can imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Fanny.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We have too much occasion to lament the unhappy effects of familiarity with servants, ever to submit to it again; depend upon us, madam, we will keep them at a proper distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me advise you, however, my dear, not to run into the contrary extreme of haughtiness. Ever treat servants with civility and kindness; this they have an undoubted right to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Since you were so good as to say, madam, that you would not hire a servant in Mary's place without con∣sulting us; will you permit me to recommend a young person, whom I dare say you will approve? She is the daughter of a very worthy man, who has lately fallen into unexpected misfortunes, and this poor girl, who has been well educated, is obliged to go to service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will hire her without the least hesitation; your account of her is a sufficient recommendation.—There is another particular, ladies, in which I must request your assistance; and that is in respect to objects of cha∣rity, such persons whom you think your own dear mamma would have relieved, I am sure will excite your compassion; and I shall heartily concur with you in giving them assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Fanny.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We are not so well acquainted, madam, with the distresses of the poor, as we used to be in mamma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time; but, for the future, we certainly will enquire
<PB N="46" REF="023336_0044_0FC602FD98DEB300"/>
concerning them. Papa was so afflicted, that he scarcely admitted any company, and the servants would not inform him of any cases of distress; pretending, that they would make him more melancholy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hard-hearted creatures! but their motive was self-interest. The case will soon be altered; my own servants, who are coming, are a set of humane people, and I hope we shall find out the poor, and relieve them as much as is in our power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Sutton (In great agitation.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, <HI>Fanny!</HI> I see my papa, with my brothers, at the gate!—O hide me! hide me! dear mamma. What shall I say if he should chance to hear of my cru∣elty to poor <HI>Caroline,</HI> and insolence to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Sutton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be agitated, my love; the affair ended so much to your honor, that, I am sure, when your papa hears the whole of it, he will praise, rather than con∣demn your conduct. It has been productive of such happy effects to me, in being the mean of overcoming your prejudices, that I shall with delight make a fair repre∣sentation of it, if occasion requires. But <HI>Caroline</HI> is fa∣tisfied, and I dare say will not mention it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Receive the explanation from me, Mr. <HI>Sutton;</HI> They are, believe me, the marks of regret for faults, which no longer have existence in her mind; they are proofs of gentleness, and promises of peace.</P>

<P>Well, my dear, I will take the first opportunity. Let us drop the subject now.</P>

<P>I am still more indebted to you for the choice you have made, than even my sister is; for I stood more in need of a kind friend, a generous adviser.</P>

<P>Such, I am confident, you will ever find in this am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣able lady.—But where are my little ones?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must take advantage of the young gentlemen's ab∣sence, to entreat that you will permit them to pass a day or two with us, before they return to school; I would not make my request before them, lest it should not be agreeable to you, and a denial might make them unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are kind in every instance.—This is a request which I cannot refuse. Indeed, if it were not for the fear of giving additional trouble to you, I should not send them to school any more. Mr. <HI>Steady</HI> has been examining them this morning in Latin, and finds them very deficient; they are besides so invincibly bashful in company, and so intolerably rude in their sports, that I fear they will lose every idea of politeness. It would be a great pleasure to me to assist in their education, and how can I employ myself better than in instructing my children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from opposing your plan, Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> I most heartily recommend it; especially, as our vicinity to <HI>London</HI> enables you to procure the best masters to assist you.</P>

O! madam, but for my worthy Mother in Law I had been poor, dependent, and wreched; but she, when my father died and left me destitute, kindly appropriated a share of a small jointure settled on her by her first husband, to give me an education that might enable me to get a genteel livelihood; or I might now have been a common servant. Through her goodness I became a school-fellow with Miss H<HI>arris,</HI> who though her condition was rather an hu∣miliating one, had a spirit so haughty, that she domi∣neered over the whole school, nor would Mrs. <HI>Bladon</HI> have suffered her to remain there, but out of com∣passion to her Father, who was a subaltern officer, and had very little more than his pay, therefore almost starved himself to place her in the situation he did.</P>

lost her mother some years before, nor had she a rela∣tion capable of providing for her: many schemes were proposed, but the insolence of her temper prevented them all from taking effect. At length the colonel of her father's regiment, from a regard to his memory, proposed sending her to the <HI>East-Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and contribut∣ed very largely towards the necessary expences.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mberg</HI> was drssed in the extreme of fashion and folly, accompanied by two young ladies, whose countenances at once betrayed pride and ill-nature? when all the bustle of seating them was over, "I have brought you,' said she," my daughters to receive their education under you; but I hope, Mrs. <HI>Trusty,</HI> you will not think of poring my girls eyes over work, or unnecessary reading, they are not designed for teachers, and I see no use <HI>ladies</HI> have for work, unless indeed they chuse to do a piece of embroidery; and I suppose if they should grow tired of it you can let some∣body finish it?

<P>She was silent, madam; but afterwards told me it was with difficulty she suppressed her indignation, at having it supposed she would take any young ladies with such directions; but the hope of gently leading them from their follies, and instilling better principles, induced her to stifle her resentment.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding that disappointment, dear Miss <HI>Loveless,</HI> you must submit to whatever your papa chuses; a mother-in law may add to your comforts; you are very young, and have no idea of the trouble there is in governing a family.

<P>Though it is improper to encourage in yourself such melancholy apprehensions, yet, in case such should be your lot, you must exert the sweetness of your dispo∣sition, and the goodness of your heart, as a support to yourself, that you may be a comfort to your father, who will deserve more pity than you, for having unde∣signedly brought such a misfortune upon you, as it will fall with double weight on him.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> CARTWRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear you must consider that this lady and you are at present strangers; besides, it will be unfair to compare all her actions with your own mamma's; it is unreasonable to expect at first sight such love as a mother shewed you.</P>

<SPEAKER>M<HI>rs.</HI> CARTWRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dog was so much encouraged by your papa and you, that the night my new lady came home he jump∣ed, and made so much of her, she was excessively alarmed, for she has very week nerves.—She gave her coachman immediate orders to secure it in the stable, but the confinement drew such howlings form it that I desired your papa to suffer me to give it away, which I did to farmer <HI>Cooper's</HI> little daughter <HI>Jenny,</HI> and she takes as much care of it as you did, and is proud of the charge.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M<HI>rs.</HI> CARTWRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear my account of them will distress you, my dear young lady, but they have only been neglected these few days, for my mistress has given possitive orders that I should never leave my employment in the house

<P>I will endeavour to attend you if you can obtain permission from your mamma; but I dare not go to ask her myself, for she has such an aversion to <HI>fat</HI> women that she cannot endure me, and therefore I am only ad∣mitted when sent for by your papa.</P>

<P>Your reason was a proper one; and yet, <HI>Cartwright,</HI> what will become of me? I can never be happy at home. My mamma despises me, and my new sisters cast such glances of contempt at me, that it is plain their sentiments agree with her's.</P>

<P>We are, indeed, too far distant from <HI>London</HI> to ad∣mit of my governess's procuring a fashionable one; but even that deficiency is in some measure supplied to us by the teacher; she has naturally a fine voice, and had an opportunity of improving her taste, at a school she formerly lived in; where it was part of her business to attend the young ladies, while their music and sing∣ing masters were with them, who were both very ca∣pital performers.</P>

<P>How pleasing it is to observe such a friendship ari∣sing between young ladies of the present age. I make
<PB N="34" REF="023336_0084_0FBEFFD837258DC0"/>
no doubt but they will ever, remain strict friends. Their dispositions are formed for the regard they pro∣fess for each other; nor will it, I am persuaded, end but with their lives.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TATE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I contemplate with great delight their growing vir∣tues. If young ladies could but be prevailed on to think how preferable inward goodness renders them, to the glitter of empty show and chatter without mean∣ing, they would surely give up fashionable folly, and court more useful attainments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your observation, Miss <HI>Tate,</HI> is very natural to eve∣ry thinking mind; there is not an object, in my opinion, more deserving pity then young people, born of parents whose sole delight proceeds from gaiety and dress. The children, it is true, for a few years, are kept from partaking their pleasures, but where such is the con∣duct of the master and mistress of a family, servants catch the infection, and instill gay ideas into the minds of children. even from their cradle. Thus prepared, they long to grow up, merely to be introduced into every scene of dissipation and folly, without imagin∣ing there is any other end proposed by their existence, and measure each other's happiness by the greatest number of times they are allowed to partake in every public entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TATE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is thus, indeed, madam, they become bad wives and mothers; with such a foundation is it wonderful, that all the attention of a governess cannot overcome prejudices so unhappily imbibed, growing as it were with their strength, and interwoven in their natures; We who have the care of so many different young ladies easily discern the advantage of children's having mo∣thers who have been attentive to them from their ear∣liest infancy; nor can it be more strongly marked than in the characters we were speaking of. Contrast them
<PB N="35" REF="023336_0085_0FBEFFDD492D8490"/>
with Miss <HI>Rawlins.</HI> Her own mother was pretty, gay, dissipated to excess. In <HI>her way</HI> she doated on her child; who was trained to all the fancies of her mo∣ther, introduced into company at three years old; and taught to talk on every subject but what she ought! Poor unthinking Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> soon lost a life she took so little care to preserve, and died a martyr to fashiona∣ble amusements. A worthey woman became, after her, Mr. <HI>Rawlins'</HI>s wife, but she could not overcome the unhappy errors of this poor unthinking girl, who calls <HI>advice</HI> ill nature, and <HI>moral rectitude</HI> absurdity. Mrs. <HI>Loveless</HI> was the most amiable of women; these two ladies left the impression of their own characters on their children, and if they could be permitted to see what passes in this world, how would one parent be blessed in beholding the virtues her attention brought forth! and how severe the punishment of the other to perceive, that neither argument, indulgence, or pun∣ishment, can overcome the fatal prejudices her con∣duct instilled!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a noble example, also, does Mrs. <HI>Gower</HI> set, who, in the prime of her life, gives up all amusement but what she can partake with her children, teaching them herself almost every branch of their education, and thus converting those talents, which were uncom∣monly cultivated by her father, to the most useful and pleasing end. She was an only child, and had a very large fortune; but being blessed with a numerous family, and her husband's circumstances much reduced during the American war, he has at her desire laid down his coach, given up his house in town, and they now reside throughout the year in the country. All the day Mrs. <HI>Gower</HI> employs in her domestic duties, and in the eve∣ning relaxes, by joining in, or promoting innocent amusements with her children. I have heard her say, that when leading a dance with them, she thinks her∣self happier, and more to be envied, than when she

These two amiable girls were bred in friendship from their infancy; their mothers set them the example: and when Mrs. <HI>Loveless</HI> died, she be∣sought her friend to let them be as little separated as possible. When Mr. <HI>Loveless</HI> found it necessary to send <HI>Maria</HI> to school, mine was recommended strongly by Mrs. <HI>Gower,</HI> and then they united in entreating they might not be parted. But this subject has led us to converse so long Miss <HI>Tate,</HI> that we forget time; ring the bell, therefore, to have the tea things remov∣ed; you must now go into the school room.—Send Miss <HI>Gower</HI> to me, she shall be my companion this eve∣ning; I must endeavour to lessen her distress, howe∣ver amiable, and give her advice that may teach her to submit, since sorrows and disappointments are the lot of every one who goes through life.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS, [<HI>embraces</HI> M<HI>iss</HI> Gower.]</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not see you before <HI>Lucy.</HI> You are all good∣ness; but what can make me happy now? I have a mamma who <HI>hates</HI> me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not make use of so harsh an expression, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> girl; nor fancy, because every wish you form is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gratified, that you are to be for ever miserable. <HI>Go</HI> frequently comes out of <HI>evil,</HI> and this little trial is per¦haps only intended to sweeten some future blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know I have a great deal to learn, my good Gover∣ness; but this is the hardest task I ever set about in my life; under your instruction I hope to make my mind easier, but you must allow me to be very unhappy for I have a mother who despises me, and treats me with every mark of indifference and contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your trial of her has been very short, and though your wishes have been disappointed at present▪ do not despond; time brings mighty things to pass; trust then to its lenient hand, and hope, that if you endeavour to overcome your mamma's prejudices you will meet suc∣cess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! madam, I would do any thing to please her; but what she thinks <HI>perfection</HI> I have been taught to call <HI>inperfection.</HI> How then can I hope, that even <HI>time</HI> will render me pleasing to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You engross me so entirely I am quite rude to Mrs.
<PB N="39" REF="023336_0089_0FBEFFE5B0926320"/>
<HI>Cartwright;</HI> pray, madam, sit down. Come, young ladies, we will all be seated, and then perhaps we may learn the cause of this extreme despondency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> CARTWRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice that my dear young lady is with friends so considerate; indeed, madam, she has passed a most un∣comfortable day; and I fear her mamma is not capa∣ble of thinking beyond herself and her own daughters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry Mrs. <HI>Cartwright</HI> that you are obliged to confirm this sad intelligence; yet still I indulge hope. I have known many bad mothers-in-law prevailed on by the respectful duty of their adopted children, to be tender and fond of them; why then should my amiable <HI>Maria</HI> despair, if she exerts the perfections Nature has given her to so laudable a purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> GOWER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! madam, you always raise depressed spirits by the wisdom of your discourse; I could almost persuade my friend to forget sorrow, and smile among us once more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it were possible to forget the unkind treat∣ment I have received. <HI>Cartwright</HI> knows all I have suffered; and after enduring every slight throughout the day, my mamma was cruel enough to continue it even to the last, though she knew I was so soon to re∣turn to school; her daughters too, unlike you, my dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> only looked at me to sneer and find fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow it is a very trying situation, and calls for all your good sense to be easy under it; but no difficulties can be overcome without attempts. I had once a scho∣lar in a situation similar to your's; her mother-in-law continued her as long as she could at school, an when forced by the censures of the world to take her home, treated her with every species of neglect; and nor con∣tented with the misery she herself inflicted, suffered
<PB N="40" REF="023336_0090_0FBEFFE79E457748"/>
her own daughters to use her ill, and made her as subservient as if their domestic. For her papa's sake she bore this treatment without a complaint; at length it pleased God to afflict her mother with a severe illness, her daughter-in-law never left her bed-side; she ad∣minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her medicines; attended to the making every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thought good for her, and gave up every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> One day, thinking her mamma asleep, she stole into the next room, where her sisters were making a great noise, entreated them to desist, and begged they would consider that perhaps their mother's life depended on her sleep not being disturb∣ed: her entreaties were without effect, they only abus∣ed her, nay, even beat her, she therefore shut them in, and returned slowly to her mamma, and again seat∣ed herself by her bed-side. The lady heard all that passed, and struck with her amiable disposition, when she returned, put back the curtain, and taking her hand, begged her pardon for having been so unjust to her, promising, when she recovered, to make her eve∣ry amends in her power. This promise she faithfully kept, and the good daughter now reaps the reward of her patience and perseverance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So sweet a story gives me emulation at least; to be sure I have been sadly disappointed, but I know it is unbecoming in me to appear to see any thing impro∣per in my father's wife; from henceforth, therefore, I will try to forget her unkind treatment, and never will I mention it out of this company. <HI>Concealment</HI> is my <HI>duty,</HI> and that at least I am capable of practising.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You distinguish very properly, my dear Miss <HI>Loveless.</HI> We should be perfect <HI>ourselves,</HI> before we venture to arraign the conduct of <HI>another. Sport not with the character of a parent, it is a sacred deposit when placed in our hands, and it would be treachery to shew any thing but the bright side.</HI> Miss <HI>Rawlins</HI> would tell me a mother
<PB N="41" REF="023336_0091_0FBEFFEBD5312BC0"/>
in-law is <HI>no</HI> parent, but I am of a different opinion, and think your father's wife claims every kind of dutiful respect that ought to be paid to a <HI>real</HI> mother; nay more, the child who behaves improperly to a mother-in-law, would have treated her own mother worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELLSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my determination, dear madam, to follow your advice in all things; experiencing, as I do, hourly, your kindness, I should be ungrateful to retain my grief. Your narrative gives me hope; besides, my papa assured me solemnly that he would make me <HI>happy. Cartwright,</HI> I begin already to recover my spiris,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> CARTWRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice to see it my dear miss; reflect always that many have greater sorrows than yours' without your comforts; but I must now leave you, as it is, I shall not be in time to send in my lady's supper, although she never has it till ten o'clock.. The leaving you as I do with such worthy friends, relieves my heart from its uneasiness on your account. One affectionate em∣brace, my dear, my beloved child! may you be blest and happy! cherish your good disposition, and it will relieve, if it can-not cure your sorrows.</P>

<P>Who, my dear papa, could have thought of seeing you to-night. I hope you won't catch cold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not rode farther than I do every fine even∣ing; but if I had, do you think I should mind any fatigue that was to be a mean of relieving your anxie∣ty, my beloved child? You were, when you left me, in visible distress, and I come once more to entreat you will banish sorrow; rely on the assurances of a tender parent, and believe, that while I have breath, you shall he made as happy as I can render you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS, [<HI>throwing her arms ronnd his neck.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear! dear papa! how shall I thank you for this goodness? Indeed I will do every thing you desire me; and try to be as happy as you wish to make me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That determination is spoken like yourself, my <HI>dear Maria.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Groves,</HI> I speak without reserve before you. Your tenderness and care of my daughter de∣mand my warmest gratitude and confidence. <HI>Maria</HI> shall never be rendered unhappy by any act of mine; nor shall she find an unpleasant home. Her aunt, who is the worthiest of women, will rejoice to be a mother to her; it was her wish to be so at the time <HI>Maria</HI> lost her own; but I knew her fondness for her niece would even prevent her being taught such necessary accom∣plishments as were requisite. When therefore you, madam, have completed these, my sister shall be grati∣fied and made happy, by having her dear <HI>Maria</HI> to live with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your affectionate attention, sir, must give Miss <HI>Love∣les</HI>s peace and joy; she has ever hitherto been all we could wish her, and I doubt not her becoming shortly sufficiently instructed in every branch of her education, to be the adopted child of her worthy and respectable aunt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P><PB N="43" REF="023336_0093_0FBEFFF1DC6B2968"/>
How ungrateful must I be, if I did not take pains to please such a father, and such friends! Believe me, dear papa, I will never designedly offend you, or for∣get the many benefits your goodness has conferred upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have all that reliance upon your conduct which I think the goodness of your disposition demands; but could wish your peace of mind restored by other reasons, in addition to my assurances. You are, now, <HI>Maria,</HI> come to an age to distinguish, and are blest with an understanding capable of so doing; hitherto you have known but <HI>one</HI> misfortune, that indeed a <HI>great one,</HI> and I should hope you incapable of ever forgetting it; the loss of a good and tender mother is hard to supply; yet how many alleviations have you to be thankful for?-that dear parent's life was spared long enough to form your young mind, and direct your understanding; you knew and felt her worth, and were sensible that imitat∣ing her in every thing would be the height of perfect∣ion in yourself; this one consideration ought to over-balance any little distress, as you know that it is the lot of persons in every rank and degree to meet with some disappointments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, Sir will venture to answer for Miss <HI>Loveless,</HI> that she will think as you very sensibly advise her: senti∣ments similar to your's she expressed to me before you came, and I doubt not her persevering in resolutions that are calculated to render both herself and her friends happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, I will do every thing I can to please you all, and hope, if ever you find me forgetful of my promises, that you will kindly tell me, and one word will restore my obedience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>This once I speak to you of your new sisters; but
<PB N="44" REF="023336_0094_0FBEFFF499A7DB18"/>
as I am become their father I am determined, if I can∣not alter their mode of thinking, I will never expose their follies. They are to be pitied, because they ne∣ver were taught better; nor could the attention and care they met with at one of our best schools overcome their perverted ideas; the elegant accomplishments so easily acquired there, have only, in them, added to their errors, because they increased their conceit with∣out encreasing their knowledge, and Mrs. <HI>Trusty,</HI> hurt at having scholars whom she could not mould to her wishes, has written to me, desiring I will inform your mamma, that she must decline receiving them any more. Thus you see, <HI>Maria,</HI> that ignorance and con∣ceit bring their own punishment; yet these unhappy girls will not, I fear, profit even by so glaring a proof of it, and will only despise the woman who could act with so much honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> GOWER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How ashamed I should be if my governess would not let me remain at school! but while I copy you, my dear <HI>Maria,</HI> there will not be any danger of my being so disgraced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> GROVES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dears; I am thankful that there is no cause to apprehend my being reduced to so disagreeable an alternative on your accounts, but I much fear there will be a necessity of sending away Miss <HI>Rawlings;</HI> she is quite incorrigible, and though I shall be very sorry to distress her worthy mother-in-law, yet I cannot risque the injury her example may be to my other scholars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M<HI>r.</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, madam, you have among your young ladies one so little deserving. It is to be lamented that children are so apt to be led by bad examples, when they may always, is they please, set a good one before their eyes. I have now, <HI>Cartwright,</HI> something to say to you. [<HI>She rises from her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very respectfully</HI>] Sit down; I look upon you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <HI>friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>domestic,</HI>

<P>Pray no more thanks; you distress me. My gift is neither equal to your merit or misfortunes; but my abilities will not permit more. I must request the fa∣vour of you to continue in your place as long as we now stay in the country, which will not be many days more, Mrs. <HI>Loveless</HI> dislikes retirement, and I do not imagine she will again pay this part of the world a visit. If, therefore, you like it, still take the care of my house; under this promise, that if ever my family come to reside here I will send you timely notice to remove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> CARTWRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will certainly, Sir, do every thing you wish me; indeed, to speak the truth, it would break my heart to leave you, and my dear young lady, as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you never shall; my <HI>Maria</HI> shall be your mistress in future, subject to no other controul, but that of seeing that she makes your days easy and hap∣py.</P>

<P>THE REFORMATION. AND THE <HI>MATERNAL SISTER.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A DRAMA,</HI> IN THREE ACTS</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB N="3" REF="023336_0099_0FBEFD06E4F14A68"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>pursuance of the plan laid down in the former part of this little work, I now present my Readers with two additional</HI> Dramatic Pieces; <HI>in which I have endea∣voured to shew, that a</HI> life of dissipation is <HI>dreadful in its consequences, as it puts a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>op to</HI> mental improvements, <HI>destroys</HI> domestic harmony, is <HI>highly</HI> injurious to so∣ciety, <HI>and endangers the loss of</HI> eternal happiness.</P>
<P><HI>It is impossible, in the compass of so short a work as the present, to place this important matter in its</HI> strongest ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; <HI>neither can advice given in this, or any other mode, be expected to have due weight, unless enforced by parental</HI> authority <HI>and</HI> example; <HI>a proper exertion of the one, and circumspection in regard to the other, would spare many mothers the sorrow of seeing their blooming offspring sink into untimely graves; and the bitter re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rse that most succeed</HI> [<HI>if any sense of</HI> religion <HI>remains in the mind</HI>] <HI>for neglecting to prepare them for so awful a change.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Full of health and gaiety, young persons, are apt to imagine their strength equal to every exertion which their love of insatiable pleasure may require. They expose themselves alternately to the excesses of</HI> heat <HI>and</HI> cold; <HI>they</HI> defy fatigue; <HI>they</HI> abridge <HI>themselves of their</HI> rest, <HI>or they take</HI> repose <HI>in those hours, when the air, cleared from</HI> noxious vapours <HI>by the</HI> morning sun, <HI>is full of</HI> invigorating freshness; <HI>which would give strength to their bodies, and improve the natural cheerfulness of their minds; not considering, that till their</HI> growth is com∣pleted, <HI>the utmost care is requisite to</HI> establish a good constitution. <HI>For such imprudent irregularities, the</HI> inexperience <HI>and</HI> impetuosity <HI>of</HI> youth <HI>may be admitted as an apology; but what can excuse the</HI> mother <HI>who, frequently for</HI> her own gratification, <HI>leads on her</HI> daugh∣ters <HI>in so dangerous a career? Many instances does the present day afford, of persons, who like Mrs.</HI> Loveless
<PB N="v" REF="023336_0100_0FBEFD0832994EE0"/>
encourage, <HI>nay</HI> cherish <HI>those very faults, which it is their duty to</HI> eradicate.</P>
<P><HI>Sorry I am to say, that such</HI> reformations <HI>as are ex∣hibited in these</HI> Dramatic Pieces, <HI>are not so much</HI> pic∣tures of what really happens in the world, <HI>as</HI> ideal representations <HI>of such as</HI> ought to take place; <HI>yet, I flatter myself, they will prove acceptable to mothers of another description, and useful to those for whom they are particularly designed; young ladies, whose</HI> school-education is completed, <HI>and who are arrived at that period of their lives, when the instruction given them, should have for its immediate object the cultivation of the</HI> Domestic Virtues, <HI>with a view to their filling, with propriety, the important offices of</HI> WIVES <HI>and</HI> MO∣THERS.</P>
<P><HI>Could the</HI> elder daughters of families <HI>be prevailed on to imitate, as far as opportunity admits, the example of the</HI> MATERNAL SISTER. <HI>they would certainly find the benefit of it in their own improvement, the increase of their parents affections, the attachment and respectfulness of their younger brothers and sisters, the esteem of the world, and the blessing of Heaven.</HI></P>

<P>If I really possess the fortitude you kindly attribute to me, my dear friend, I am chiefly indebted for it to my honoured mother, who from the dawn of reason, studied to strengthen my mind to bear disappointments; her kind endeavours were seconded by the arguments of my worthy governess; and at length, strongly con∣firmed by the conduct and precepts of my good aunt, during the two years I lived with her as her adopted daughter. The loss of such dear instructors, called into <HI>practice</HI> the lessons which had been so repeatedly taught me.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now that you have <HI>lost</HI> all these dear connec∣tions, you are still contented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I ought to be. It is true, I do, and ever shall regret them; no time will wear out the remem∣brance of their perfections, or my gratitude for their kindness to me. But ought I to repine for blessings past, who have not only the tenderest of fathers, but, in Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> one of the kindest of friends? she has taken me as one of her own family, and never suffers me to feel any other ill effects from the death of my relations, than the loss of their society.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, <HI>Maria,</HI> you have great <HI>sensibility;</HI> there∣fore, the steady calmness of your temper must have been <HI>acquired,</HI> and I should suppose with some difficul∣ty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, that by observing the good instructions that have been given me, I have been able to subdue a natural quickness in my temper, and I have had many opportunities of remarking the advantages of a meek resigned spirit, in comparison of a fretful discontented mind; the former <HI>lessens</HI> every <HI>evil,</HI> nay, often turns

I was for a short tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a prey to its corrosive bitterness; but thanks to the pru∣dence of my good mother-in-law, I have long been free from its pangs and hope never more to endure what cannot be recollected even at this dista<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> period without pain; because the remembrance of what I then felt, is inseparably connected with a sense of my own folly, which alone subjected me to such uncom∣fortable feelings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Through the unremitting attention of my dear mamma, to point out to my observation every cir∣cumstance by which I might improve my temper, two instances in particular made indelible impressions on my mind. The one was, of a lady who had, amongst several other <HI>fine</HI> children a son that was afflicted with fits from his birth, which had so impaired his faculties, that he was become an ideot. The poor miserable object was suddenly taken off in one of his fits, whilst we were visiting at her house. His mother, instead of being thankful for so great a merry, threw herself into agonies of sorrow, refused to be comforted, and uttered such shocking expressions, as I cannot recollect without horror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>She certainly was very blameable; but I suppose the other instance was a contrast to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was indeed. Poor Mrs. <HI>Colding!</HI> I think I now have you before my eyes! This amiable woman was deprived of the best of husbands by a consumption. Scarcely had she reconciled herself to this severe loss
<PB N="4" REF="023336_0104_0FBEFD12801ED688"/>
when her only son, a promising youth of sixteen, was seized with a frenzy fever, which put an end to his life in three days. My mother, who was her nearest friend, prevailed on her to come to our house, in hope of giving her comfort; by which means, I had an opportunity of seeing the power of patient resignation, in its full force. This excellent woman struggled with her grief; she opened her m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to consolation—never was heard to utter one repining word, but actually <HI>overcame</HI> her sorrow; and rejoiced, that those so dear to her were removed to a happier state! When I was deprived of my dear mother. I called to my mind the different behaviour of these two Indies, and the lessons which had been given me on their examples, and found them very useful. I assur you, <HI>Isabella.</HI></P>

<P>Without witnessing such instances as you mention my dear, <HI>my mind,</HI> which was once likely to become the seat of the Furies, has not only been calmed and improved by the instructions of my present dear mam∣ma, but also by attention to opinons given in company, concerning people judged to possess violent uncontroul∣ed passions, and others who submitted to the decrees of Providence like christians.—But here comes my dear mamma.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> SUTTON</SPEAKER>
<P>He is perfectly well, my dear, I have just parted with him. His late silence has been occasioned by a par∣ticular hurry of business, and frequent journies. To keep you no longer in suspence, poor Miss <HI>Blomberg</HI> is dy∣ing of a consumption, brought on entirely by <HI>habits of dissipation;</HI> nor could your father prevail with her to try the <HI>Bristol</HI> waters, untill the <HI>full season</HI> commenc∣ed, for she would stay in town to go to court on the birth day; and since she came here, has, until within this week, gone to every ball. At the last she fainted three times. Now she is too bad even to walk from her bed to a sofa, but is carried; yet they carefully conceal her danger from her; suffer her to hear noth∣ing but the most trifling novels; amuse her mind with planning the most becoming dresses for a sick person, and admit all company that she may not be melancho∣ly.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps the situation I have been in since we part∣ed, which prevented my making enquiries after you, might also occasion your never being mentioned, to me. I was sent for by my aunt soon after you left school, who, in a very short time, fell into a decline; two years put a period to her life. During her illness, I had but little intercourse with the world, for I con∣fined myself almost constantly to her apartment. Since her death, I have lived with Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> my aunt's intimate friend. As long as my worthy governess lived, I kept up a correspondence with her, and was going to pay her a visit, where probably I should have heard of my old play-fellow, but Mrs. <HI>Groves'</HI>s sudden death, deprived me of the pleasure I promised my self, in the society of so inestimable a friend.</P>

<P>How can I sufficiently thank you, my dear Miss <HI>Loveless,</HI> for your kind indulgence to an unhappy crea∣ture! I cannot give you now the whole history of my shameful misconduct, for I expect every minute to be called to Miss <HI>Blomberg,</HI> I must therefore, hasten to tell you, that after treating my dear father and his amiable wife, with the utmost ingratitude and disres∣pect, in return for their unparalleled kindness and in∣dulgence, I formed a connection with a worthless man, of low degree, and consented to a <HI>clandestine mar∣riage.</HI>—An unhappy step which I have had cause to repent from the first moment I was rash enough to take it! I exchanged my dear father's house for a mean miserable lodging. And soon as the wretch, I had married, found he was deceived in the information which had been given him, that I could claim my mo∣ther's jointure on the day of my marriag, he began to treat me in the cruelest manner; in consequence of such inhumanity, I was soon seized with a violent ill∣ness, in which he abandoned me, and I have never since heard of him. I happily recovered through the tender care of my landlady; and finding an absolute necessity for doing something for a livelihood, [for I had not courage to return to my father] I requested
<PB N="13" REF="023336_0113_0FBEFD24B008DC18"/>
this good woman to make enquiries for me; and by her recommendation, I now wait upon the Miss <HI>Blom∣bergs.</HI> So far from repining at the mortifications I en∣dure, I regard them as the just punishment of my diso∣bedience.</P>

<P>I am greatly affected with your narrative.

I would not add to your afflictions, but if I could lessen them, it would give me much satisfaction.

left they should miss any place of fashionable resort, or that the world should suppose they are not at the top of the <HI>ton;</HI> and I verily believe, that frequently, when a good deal indisposed, they stifle their com∣plaints, and affect to be in perfect health, rather than give up a party, which it is impossible for them to enjoy.</P>

<P>Could my wishes avail, no could should obscure the bright sunshine of your days. O, my dear, my amia∣ble friend, how <HI>little</HI> do I appear in my own estimation, when conscience draws a comparison between <HI>your ex∣cellencies</HI> and <HI>my indiscretion.</HI></P>

<STAGE>[<HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Sutton <HI>with a Letter in her hand.</HI>]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE, my dear <HI>Maria,</HI> read what I have writ∣ten to Mrs. <HI>Rawlins;</HI> her goodness will make our best advocate in behalf of the poor pentitent; and I hope she will be able to prevail on her father to grant her forgiveness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS, [reads,—then speaks.]</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, madam, you have said every thing that a feeling mind could dictate; and sincerely do I join my wishes to yours, that this letter may be successful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonished, to think it should be in <HI>human nature,</HI> for a young person well brought up, to act as Miss <HI>Rawlins</HI> has done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor is it in <HI>human nature,</HI> my dear, to commit such enormities, where the <HI>better part</HI> of that nature, <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> is suffered to prevail. Miss <HI>Rawlins'</HI>s behaviour is a melancholy instance, among a thousand others that might be produced, of the ill effects of indulging headstrong passions. In vain does parental authority exert its influence over a mind resolved to resist it; the ear of the self-willed is deaf to the kindest admoni∣tions. All that a parent can do, is to recommend the best path; but if the child will think her knowlege superior to that of her instructors, and refuse to obey the advice of experience, she must fall, and become miserable, like poor Miss <HI>Rawlins.</HI></P>

What a rock have we escaped, my dear mamma, left, as we were, for a time, to our own guidance, or rather to the fatal influence of servants. How thank∣ful ought we to be, that our minds were not so entire∣ly depraved, as to make us insensible of your kindness, and to prevent our seeing the advantages of obeying you, otherwise, we might have involved ourselves in similar distresses with this unfortunate young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, my dear. But though I can by no mean acquit Miss <HI>Rawlins,</HI> yet I must say, that she has an excuse which you could not have pleaded. Her mamma was the very reverse of yours, and lived just long enough to strengthen the weeds springing in her child's mind, which was the proper business of mater∣nal care to eradicate. The unfortunate prejudice, which in common with many other young people, Miss <HI>Rawlins</HI> took up against a mother-in-law, prevented her listening to the admonitions of hers, which increas∣ed her stubborness to such pitch, that nothing but the miseries she has endured, could have evercome them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>How different has been my lot! Had I been blessed with such a friend in my father's wife, my happiness would have been complete.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfect happiness, my dear girl, is not the lot of mor∣tals; the greatest share of it we can obtain, is from a <HI>self-approving conscience.</HI> Endeavour to do your duty in every relation of life, and this blessing will be yours, from whence will spring, as its natural fruits, peace of mind, and cheerfulness of temper. These, I am much deceived, if you do not all three already enjoy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we do, in general, mamma. But the dread∣ful state of Miss <HI>Blomberg,</HI> and the misfortunes of Miss <HI>Rawlins,</HI> have cast a gloom over our minds, which we find it difficult to remove.</P>

Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>By admitting the tender feelings of humanity for the distresses of <HI>others,</HI> you act agreeably to the principles of benevolence and christianity. But let me warn you against <HI>indulging</HI> them to <HI>excess.</HI> Take a tender part in the affliction of your fellow creatures of every de∣gree,—relieve their wants,—give them consolation to the utmost of your power;—But, at the same time, support your own spirits, or your life will be a bur∣den to you, and your company, disagreeable to your friends; nay, you will incapacitate yourselves for the kind offices you engage in.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot imagine what <HI>distress</HI> we are in! Only think of the stage omitting to bring our new dresses for to-night's ball! and we would rather stay away than appear in those we have been seen in before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is horribly provoking. I wish we had sent one of our own carriages for them. I suppose, madam, [<HI>addressing herself to Mrs.</HI> Sutton,] that you and these young ladies will be there, and that adds to the disap∣pointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intended, when I came to <HI>Bristol,</HI> to give my dear girls a taste of all the entertainments the place affords; and we had determined to go to the ball this evening; but Miss <HI>Loveless</HI> was so exceedingly affected with hear∣ing of Miss <HI>Blomberg'</HI>s situation,, that I am sure she will decline going, and I know my daughters would on no account leave her by herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS. [confused]</SPEAKER>
<P>I see no reason that Miss <HI>Loveless</HI> should deny her∣self those pleasures her age entitles her to. Besides,
<PB N="18" REF="023336_0118_0FBEFD32905939F8"/>
Miss <HI>Blomberg</HI> will soon be better; she is only <HI>weak,</HI> and I make no doubt but that she will in a short time be restored to perfect health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, madam, some <HI>illness</HI> must have brought on that <HI>excessive weakness,</HI> and until the <HI>cause</HI> is remove¦ed, how can she possibly <HI>recover her strength?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>La, <HI>Maria!</HI> You are so fanciful? <HI>Juliana</HI> has only <HI>over racketted herself.</HI> Perhaps you will say, that I am <HI>ill,</HI> when I tell you, that I <HI>fainted away twice</HI> this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orning,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I wonder how you have strength or courage even to walk about after it, much less to talk of going to a ball.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you chuse to call me <HI>fanciful</HI> or not, my dear Miss <HI>Amelia,</HI> I am exceedingly <HI>concerned,</HI> nay <HI>alarmed,</HI> at hearing you say so; especially, when you really appear to me <HI>considerably thinner</HI> than when I saw you last; but yet, the <HI>bloom in your cheeks</HI> gives me hopes that my fears, are groundless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think I would go about in public with <HI>pale cheeks</HI> when fashion authorises me to supply the want of <HI>natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oses</HI> with <HI>artificial ones!</HI> I am not ashamed to say that I <HI>use rouge;</HI> and you must have very unfashionable eyes, not to have discerned it at the first glance, for I took no pains in laying it on, to imi∣tate <HI>vulgar nature,</HI> I assure you. I adore the lady who first ventured to appear in <HI>public</HI> with <HI>painted cheeks,</HI> in defiance of the prejudice which so long pre∣vailed in the <HI>English</HI> nation against it; and should even wish, like <HI>Narcissa</HI> mentioned by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Essays, to be <HI>painted in my coffin.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must excuse their ignorance, Miss <HI>Amelia,</HI> for
<PB N="19" REF="023336_0119_0FBEFD33B4261518"/>
you know the Miss <HI>Suttons</HI> and Miss <HI>Loveless</HI> also have been introduced into the world by an old <HI>fashioned woman,</HI> in whose mind the prejudice you ridicule is so strongly rooted, that no arguments can possibly era∣dicate it; and you must excuse my saying, that it shall be my earnest endeavour to prevent every young per∣son, over whom I have any influence, from adopting a custom, which sober sense and reason must condemn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must not take the young ladies into <HI>public,</HI> for there is absolutely no such thing as being seen without <HI>rouge.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you say, Mrs. <HI>Sutotn,</HI> if you were to see <HI>Ju∣liana</HI> then? She is frequently obliged to lie down, which rubs the rouge off, and as soon as she rises, is impatient to have it repaired. Poor thing! I wish she was well enough to do it herself, for our maid is possitively the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wardest creature at it in the world. She declares she never <HI>saw</HI> such a thing before. I wonder what b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utes she has lived with!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her youth is some excuse for her ignorance. She appears to be very young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A demure little puss! She has not half <HI>life</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> enough for <HI>me</HI> Instead of <HI>diverting</HI> my sister, she has always tears in her eyes. I declare, were she <HI>my</HI> maid only I would soon send her away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps some private sorrow of <HI>her own</HI> may oppress her heart. She looks <HI>genteel</HI> and <HI>well-bred.</HI> But if her sensibility arises from her concern for Miss <HI>Bhom∣berg,</HI> I honor and esteem her for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I find out that she is <HI>unhappy,</HI> I shall desire <HI>Julian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to let me provide another servant for her I would have nothing melancholy come near her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P><PB N="20" REF="023336_0120_0FBEFD35A9E49048"/>
It is certainly proper to endeavour to keep up the spirits of sick people; but <HI>mirth,</HI> is in my opinion, full as impertinent as <HI>sorrow</HI> in the countenance and be∣haviour of their attendants. Have you advice for Miss <HI>Blomberg,</HI> madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Dr. <HI>Burgess</HI> attends her every day. He seems to think her exceedingly ill, but it is the way with those sort of people, to pretend their patients are very bad, that their own skill in curing them may ap∣pear the greater.—Will not you come and see her, ladies, during her confinement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly, madam. But as Miss <HI>Loveless</HI> was not admitted, <HI>we</HI> could not hope to be received, so intended to defer paying our compliments, until <HI>she</HI> had been sent for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if you are determined not to grace the ball this evening, will you drink your tea with her? <HI>Amelia</HI> and I are engaged in a large party; you must excuse <HI>us.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, madam.</P>
</SP>

<P>We must now wish you a good morning. Come, <HI>Amelia.</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>They go out.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS, [bursts into tears.]</SPEAKER>
<P>It is to too much? I cannot see them runing thus blindly to <HI>misery,</HI> without the deepest concern, yet dare not speak my thoughts.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Comfort yourself, my dear, and be thankful that you had friends to snatch you from so perilous a state.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I meant, what I said about Miss <HI>Rawlins,</HI> as a pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de to her story; but finding Mrs. <HI>Loveless</HI> and <HI>Amelia</HI>

<SPEAKER>Miss. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder how Mrs. <HI>Loveless</HI> will bear this dread∣ful event, for which her mind was so unprepared.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should think it would break her heart. What at trying scene will mamma and poor <HI>Maria</HI> have!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know two people better qualified for such scenes than they are. Capable of deriving instruc∣tion themselves from the faults of others and of mitigating sorrow with tender sympathy, accompanied with a constant presence of mind; for want of which, many people increase the distresses they attempt to soothe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not yet attained this happy presence of mind. I am <HI>all agitation,</HI> and could not have <HI>courage</HI> to go to Mr. <HI>Loveless</HI> now on any account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could wish to avoid it; but if occasion required, would summon up all my fortitude; for it certainly is
<PB N="22" REF="023336_0122_0FBEFD38FB14F830"/>
very wrong to <HI>run away</HI> from our friends in <HI>affliction.</HI> Suppose, my dear, as you are so affected, we take a turn in the garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY.</SPEAKER>

<P>Pray, mamma, do not talk so, my sister may yet recover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, name not such an impossibility! These eyes beheld her in the last agonies.—These ears heard her dying groans. The look she cast on me, seemed to accuse me as the author of all her misery. What cause has she now to wish that she had been born to poverty, that she might have been blessed with health?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had not gone into the room.</P>

Had I listened to the admonitions of my husband, who saw the danger I exposed my dear child to, by suffering her to trust a constitution, naturally delicate, to <HI>night air,</HI> and <HI>exces∣sive fatigue</HI> she might now long live in health and peace, instead of—O Heaven! do I not hear groans?</P>

<P>Talk not of comfort, it can never reach a wretch like me. Bewildered in a labyrinth of folly! Wan∣dering in darkness, my eyes could only be opened by a stroke like this. Fate has taken its revenge upon me, and made me the most miserable creature existing!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whoever sincerely repents of their indiscretions, my dear madam, may with confidence hope for pardon. It would be presumptuous in me to say, that you have not been guilty of a great offence in the eyes of the Supreme Being. And I would not be so insincere and wicked, as to flatter you into further errors, at a time, when such proper convictions fill your mind, as will, I trust, effect that change, which must end in peace and happiness. Cherish and improve these convictions, and you will have no cause to <HI>despair.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You too, my dear <HI>Maria</HI> how cruelly have I used you. Jealous of your worth, I banished you from your father's house, nay, endeavoured to eradicate you from his heart; but in that, I now with thank∣fulness reflect, I was unsuccessful. Go then from such a monster, I am undeserving of your sweet attention.</P>

<P>No, my dear mamma, I will not abandon you in this hour of your distress.

<P>In the midst of those sorrows which oppress my heart, this reconcilliation gives me inexpressible comfort. Where is your father, my dear? I fear he must in his heart despise me; yet, with what patience has he sub∣mitted to my caprices. I long, yet dread to see him.</P>

Now you are gone, as I fear you must by this time be, I feel my love for you stronger than it was possible for me to do, while engaged in a constant round of amusements, which left no time for the cultivation of social affec∣tions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Amelia</HI> my dear child, do not rend my heart with your lamentation. Consider how your sorrow adds to my afflictions. Follow, henceforth, dear <HI>Maria's</HI> exam∣ple.

<P>O! my dear madam, I have been engaged in a most affecting scene, and long to tell you the happy effects of my endeavours to comfort them.

<P>I have been reading in the <HI>Adventurer</HI> the journal of a fine lady, which so properly ridicules the life of one, that I feel quite confounded and shocked at hav∣ing been ambitious of this character; and am deter∣mined for the future to act like a rational creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have formed the same resolutions; but, alas! my dear, ill habits have taken deeper root in <HI>my</HI> mind than in <HI>yours,</HI> and will require more pains to eradi∣cate: however, I will not despair.</P>

<P>Your servant ladies. So you have taken possession of my books during my absence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have indeed: since we have resolved to relin∣quish <HI>frivolous amusements,</HI> what can we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o in the
<PB N="39" REF="023336_0139_0FBEFD62F0D15C38"/>
absence of our friends, but seek entertainment from the works of the learned? If <HI>Amelia</HI> and I pursue our plan, we perhaps shall, in time, <HI>surprise</HI> you as much with our <HI>erudition,</HI> as we have before shocked you with our <HI>ignorance:</HI> but you and Mrs. <HI>Sutton</HI> must direct our studies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot appoint me to a more pleasing office: I long to present dear <HI>Amelia</HI> with a little library, and shall set about the selection of it the first leisure hour, in order to make the purchase of the books as soon as I go to town; but I shall not proceed with-out Mrs. <HI>Sutton's</HI> advice, of whose taste I have the highest opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very good, sir; I shall endeavour to derive advantage from your kindness.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Sutton <HI>accompanied by Miss</HI> Sutton <HI>and</HI> Miss Fanny.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear ladies, how do you find yourselves now? you see I have left you but to return with en∣reased forces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are your <HI>auxiliaries,</HI> and engaged in the cause of friendship, and as such must be welcome to me: I am indebted to your kindness, madam, for more sereni∣ty of mind than I could possibly have obtained by my own weak efforts, after such affecting conflicts. But I have met with a great mortification during your ab∣sence, from an unsucces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful attempt which I have made to amuse myself with a <HI>book</HI> of <HI>morality.</HI> I have so accustomed myself to the reading of <HI>Novels,</HI> that I fear I have lost the capacity of deriving instruction from other books.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! that is not the case, I dare say! But you must wean your mind by degrees from the <HI>light</HI> reading you
<PB N="40" REF="023336_0140_0FBEFD65214BFCA0"/>
have beed used to, and not attempt very grave au∣thors at once. <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Allegory,</HI> with an agreeable mixture of <HI>Poetry,</HI> would, in my opinion, be proper to <HI>begin</HI> with, from which you might proceed to <HI>History,</HI> and <HI>gradually</HI> bring yourself to take delight in books of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morality.</HI> Miss <HI>Amelia,</HI> I have a new publication, which, as I subscribed for several sets, I will beg leave to present to you; it is called the <HI>Six Princesses of Babylon,</HI> and relates the history of their travels towards the Temple of Virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The author of these Drantas has not the least</HI> per∣sonal <HI>knowledge of the writer of the above mentioned work; but thinking it an ingenious performance, and understand∣ing from the dedication, that an extensive sale was of consequence to her, was willing to give what little assistance she could towards promoting it.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall read whatever you recommend, madam, with my best attention. I am sure I have great need of a <HI>guide to the Temple of Virtue.</HI> How do you do, my dear Miss Sutton and Miss <HI>Fanny?</HI> I was impatient to see you: you have heard, to be sure, that dear <HI>Juliana</HI> is likely to be restored to us again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the highest satifaction, we have; and I most sincerely congratulate you on the happy and unex∣pected change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accept of my congratulations also, my dear. I hope we shall all enjoy many happy days together; but where is Miss <HI>Loveless?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>She retired with her friend Mrs. <HI>Benfield,</HI> in hopes of composing her spirits, which were greatly agitated.</P>
<P>I never saw a poor creature so humbled in my life! I will send for Miss <HI>Loveless,</HI> [<HI>she rings the bell a ser∣vent enters,</HI>] If Miss <HI>Loveless</HI> is disengaged, tell her, we

wish for her company [<HI>servant goes out.</HI>] I appre∣hend, that you, Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Loveless,</HI> have been using some means torestore Mrs. <HI>Benfield</HI> to her parents.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Enter Miss</HI> Loveless.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>How have you left your friend, dear <HI>Maria?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have at length succeeded so far, as to prevail on her to lie down, and endeavour to get to sleep; but I fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will long be a prey to the bitterest remorse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope her constitution will sustain the shock, and do, most sincerely pity her; but is not her father a still greater object of compassion, who does not deserve the misery of mind which she has brought to him? But you were enquiring, Mrs. <HI>Loveless,</HI> what means Mr. <HI>Loveless</HI> and I had been employing in her behalf? you were right in your conjecture, that it was on her ac∣count I summoned him to my house, which, on a less important business, would, at such a time, have, been impertinent. I hope you excuse me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly, my dear madam! I have this day felt so powerfully the comfort of your friendship, that I should be sorry you should be restrained from exerting it for others, by those <HI>ceremonious punctilios,</HI> which, I hope, my mind has now got above; but what could Mr. <HI>Loveless</HI> do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must first tell you, that on my return to my lodg∣ing, I found Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> and Miss <HI>Gower</HI> waiting for me. It seems Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> came the day before to spend a week or two with Mr. <HI>Gower</HI> at <HI>Redlands</HI> where he has lately taken a house; Miss <HI>Gower</HI> having visited us since we came to <HI>Bristol,</HI> mentioned this circumstance to Mrs. <HI>Rawlins,</HI> who resolved to call on me, in hopes that <HI>Maria</HI> might be 
<PB N="42" REF="023336_0142_0FBEFD6947D3DC48"/>
able to give her some information concerning the un∣happy fugitive. The letter I sent this morning, of course has not yet reached her hands; but by conversing with Mrs. <HI>Rawlins,</HI> I had an opportunity of saying more in Mrs. <HI>Benfield'</HI>s favour, than a letter could comprise; and I took the liberty of sending for Mr. <HI>Loveless</HI> as a joint advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what success have you had, my dear madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much, my love, as I could reasonably expect: Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> is all gentleness and compassion, and would, I am sure, immediately receive her daughter home; but Mr. <HI>Rawlins</HI>'s consent must be obtained first; and that she cannot ask at present, because his mind has been greatly irritated by the ill behaviour of his son-in-law, who has been insolent enough to go to his house and demand his wife, under pretence, that she has eloped from him: not that he wants to live with her, but merely to extort money from her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am shocked to hear this, perhaps we shall soon have the wretch amongst us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can remove your fears on that head, my dear; for Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> informed us, that Mr. <HI>Rawlins</HI> has pre∣vailed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to go to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> where he has procured him a post, and has put a sum of money into the hands of the captain who takes him over, to equip him for the voyage, and supply him with necessaries on his arrival in <HI>India.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice to hear it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Benfield</HI> has, I dare say, lived in constant dread of his discovering her retreat, and molesting her quiet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I imagine she has. What a miserable life must a poor
<PB N="43" REF="023336_0143_0FBEFD6B32074040"/>
poor young creature lead who has formed such a dis∣graceful connection! I cannot conceive a more mor∣tifying circumstance than to be married to a wretch ones family is ashamed to own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could give you histories of several young ladies who have involved themselves in the utmost difficulties by such acts of indiscretion; but as I have no reason to think my dear girls, or any of the young ladies now present, stand in need of farther admonition on this subject, there is no occasion to multiply instances. That before their eyes would be a sufficient antidote for them, were any necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I flattered myself, dear madam, you would have been able to restore my friend to the favour of her parents. What will become of her if her father should, after all, reject her? I am sure she would break her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>She may continue, here, my dear, till the recon∣ciliation is completed, which I make no doubt will in time be brought about, as her cause is in such good hands,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FANNY SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, my good sir, if it was represented to Mr. <HI>Rawlins</HI> how very penitent his daughter is, he must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rawlins</HI> is a very good man, Miss <HI>Fanny,</HI> and will act as a Christian, I make no doubt: but consider, his feelings must have been very distressing ones, and some time must be allowed to conquer them. Consider also, the disgrace his daughter has brought upon a re∣putable family, and her former disobedient behaviour, and then you cannot wonder if he withholds his for∣giveness, at least till he is sure that her penitence is sincere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="44" REF="023336_0144_0FBEFD6E78C78D90"/>
Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would answer for that, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well. <HI>Maria,</HI> the day may be near, and I sincerely hope it is, when <HI>your testimony</HI> in her favour may be heard by Mr <HI>Rawlins.</HI> In the mean time, have pa∣tience, and rejoice that Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> is her friend, who will certainly exert her influence, from which we may expect success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend upon it, Miss <HI>Loveless,</HI> that I shall take every step in my power to effect the desired reconciliation, and to comfort the poor mourner. It may perhaps be better for her that it is brought on by degrees, than that in her present weak state of spirits she should be called to a trial which she has not yet fortitude to sustain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, my dear madam, the benevolence of your disposition will lead you to pay a ready attention to this deplorable case; and I am sure my dear papa will not be remiss. My dear mamma has promised Mrs. <HI>Benfield</HI> an asylum, and <HI>Amelia</HI> has assured her of her friendly offices. I have been told of <HI>Juliana'</HI>s kindness to her since her recovery, all which must contribute to restore her tranquility; and I think things are in such a train, that I may venture to comfort her with hopes, that her good fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er will be induced to wipe the tears of repentant sorrow from her eyes, and that she may once more know the sweets of peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will receive the forgiveness of all good people, but much I fear she will never obtain her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her self condemnation is very commendable, ma∣dam, and I hope her follies will ever be remembered by her, with that degree of regret, which will make her abhor the thoughs of repeating them. But if her
<PB N="45" REF="023336_0145_0FBEFD6FC5EF4D68"/>
reformation is sincere, she may enjoy a great deal of happiness in striving to repair her faults, by future good behaviour, and seeing her endeavours kindly ac∣cepted. Not so much, to be sure, as if she had never deviated from the path of duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall myself experience this kind of sa∣tisfaction. My eyes are now open; I despise the al∣lurements of the gay world, and long for a quiet retreat. It is my earnest wish, Mr. <HI>Loveless,</HI> to go to that house which I once so foolishly despised. There it should be my daily endeavour to restore the com∣forts you once enjoyed in it. My own desiciencies will prevent my succeeding in my desire of imitating the excellencies of <HI>Maria'</HI>s mother: but you shall find me dutiful to you, and affectionate to your child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your proposal delights me: I will write to have the house got ready for our reception immediately. But I now particularly miss an old friend, whose assist∣ance on this occasion would be very useful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean Mrs. <HI>Cartwright.</HI> I was myself thinking of her, but fear she is too valuable to Mrs. <HI>Sutton</HI> to be given up; besides, I used her so unkindly, that she will be afraid to live with me again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> madam, has so liberal a mind, that I am sure she retains no resentment for behaviour, which proceeded from your not knowing her worth. I will engage to say, she will be very ready to superin∣tend your family in a house which she left with regret; but I shall have a great loss; you really commit cruel depredations upon me—What! rob me of <HI>two</HI> of my household at once? I must have my revenge—and thus I will take it. Mrs. <HI>Benfield</HI> shall possitively supply the place of Mrs. <HI>Cartwright</HI> to me and Miss <HI>Juliana,</HI> when she is dismissed by Dr. <HI>Burges,</HI> shall be my guest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="023336_0146_0FBEFD712E957DC8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot resist your kind offer: it will be a great advantage to dear <HI>Juliana</HI> to be under your good ma∣nagement; for <HI>my part,</HI> I am so ignorant in respect to invalids, that it is probable I might commit some fatal error: but one more condition I must make, my dear madam, which is, that as soon as we are settled, you favour me with your company at my house. Remem∣ber I am your <HI>scholar,</HI> and if you leave me too long by myself I may relapse into my former follies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree to your condition, with all my heart; and as the distance between us is not very great, we may frequently interchange visits. I shall make a point of staying at <HI>Bristol</HI> as long as you do, in order to take Miss <HI>Juliana</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Benfield</HI> with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a happy day is this to me! I now look for∣ward with expectation of enjoying, once more, the dear delight of domestic peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I flatter myself with the hopes that I shall be a sin∣cere partaker of it, and heartily bid adieu to the delusives pleasures of the gay world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Balls! masquerades! and all the fatiguing, satiating murderers of time, which I have hitherto courted, I relinquish you without a sigh! and shall cheerfully welcome the joys of rural life, which I have formerly despised. No more shall my cheeks be painted but by the hand of health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whilst you form this wise resolution, my dear young friend, of altering your course of living, be careful of not running into a contrary extreme. <HI>Moderate</HI> amuse∣ments were intended to <HI>sweeten the cares of life,</HI> and may be <HI>innocently enjoyed;</HI> it is making them the <HI>business</HI> of it that is <HI>blameable.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="47" REF="023336_0147_0FBEFD72B451EBC0"/>
Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am under your direction, madam; mould me to your wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall have great cause to be proud of my scholar, I make no doubt, since I have <HI>humility</HI> to build on as a <HI>foundation, on</HI> which every virtue may be erected; <HI>without</HI> which, none can be brought to perfection. If I may be allowed to begin my <HI>first lesson</HI> now, I would recommend to your immediate practice, my dear, these few short rules. Entertain a moderate opinion of your own abilities; consider that you have much to learn, and exert your industry to redeem lost time: instead of coveting the applauses of the <HI>gay world,</HI> endeavour to obtain the esteem of the <HI>worthy</HI> and <HI>rational</HI> part of it; and in every action have a regard to the glory of God, and the good of your fellow crea∣tures. Command my best services ever—But, my dear girls, [<HI>to Miss</HI> Suttons] it is time for us to take our leave; to-morrow, ladies, we shall have the plea∣sure of enquiring after Miss <HI>Juliana,</HI> and hope to see her much recovered. [<HI>They take leave and the scene closes,</HI></P>

<P>To dinner, child! What pleasure can I have in dining at home, where there is nothing but noise, con∣fusion, and disturbance? Happy is the man, who is not plagued with a family of children! What a fool was I to marry, and involve myself in endless expence! Not a day passes but I am pestered with some trades∣man's bill or other.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have reason to believe, dear sir, that the servants have taken advantage of poor mamma's ill state of
<PB N="3" REF="023336_0150_0FBEFD7BC9E6ED68"/>
health, and have been wasteful and extravagant in every respect, and by this means your expences are increased beyound what they would naturally be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ill state of health! yes, your mother has brought herself unto a fine condition by her continual racket∣ing; and because I had not charge enough before, she must now be supplied with money to spend at the <HI>South of France.</HI> I cannot go on at this rate! my estate is out at el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows already!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND, [with emotion.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, sir! but give me leave to observe, that my poor mamma lived in the fashionable world; her connections required, that she should enter a great deal into the gaieties of life: her ill health surely de∣serves compassion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my dear girl; and sincerely do I regret her situation; but my mind is so distressed with the state of my finances, that I scarcely know what I do or say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must then, all of us, study to live accordingly; for my part, sir, I am willing to do every thing in my power to lessen your expences: my good aunt has taken great pains to instruct me in the different branches of domestic oeconomy, and has promised to favor me with her advice. I will endeavour to practice her lessons in the best manner I can: my <HI>errors</HI> you will kindly excuse; and I hope, by assiduous attention, to improve daily. If agreeable to you, sir, I will undertake to supply the house-keeper's place myself. Mrs. <HI>Newton</HI> has, this morning, expressed her desire to go away, on my objecting to some superfluous articles in the bill of fare for to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let her go!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will also, for the <HI>present,</HI> undertake the instruction
<PB N="4" REF="023336_0151_0FBEFD7D356F2B30"/>
of the <HI>younger children,</HI> if agreeable to you, sir. My aunt says, she cannot think the school <HI>Catherine</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> were at, before they came home to be inocu∣lated, by any means a good one, and to send them to a better will be very expensive: to teach them in the best manner I can, will be a delightful employment to me: and if you will permit <HI>Clarissa</HI> and <HI>Emma</HI> to leave school, I make no doubt they will readily assist me in it. They are now <HI>great girls,</HI> and what their <HI>school education</HI> at present costs you, will be a con∣siderable saving. The coach is gone to fetch them home for the holidays; will you give me permission to communicate my scheme to them, and try if they will concur with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk like a good girl <HI>Jemima</HI>-an excellent girl! but I fear undertake too much; however, do as you will; my expences <HI>must</HI> be drawn into a <HI>narrower compass</HI> by some means or other; I shall be absolutely ruined else. [<HI>Rising from the tea-table</HI>] Adieu, my dear! I shall see you again in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will you not dine with me, dear sir? consider how long I have been absent from you—that my sisters are coming home.—Indeed your presence is necessary to give me consequence in the house, and to enforce the authority you have been pleased to invest me with. I shall not, without your countenance, be able to put my plans in execution: besides, what shall I do if the servants, who are already ripe for rebellion, should insult me? Upon my word, my courage will fail me, if you will not stay at home <HI>this day</HI> at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Jemima,</HI> you have a most engaging way with you; there is no denying you any thing: I <HI>will</HI> stay at home; but <HI>how to employ myself here</HI> is the question? It is a <HI>strange</HI> place to me, in which for many years I have been accustomed merely to <HI>sleep</HI> and <HI>breakfast,</HI> unless
<PB N="5" REF="023336_0152_0FBEFD7EB075AB90"/>
the necessity of entertaing company obliged me to <HI>dine</HI> and <HI>sup;</HI> but on these occasions, the thoughts of my family and expences were drowned in mirth and gaie∣ty. If I sit <HI>alone</HI> and <HI>reflect</HI> I shall go distracted.</P>

<P>You shall <HI>not</HI> be <HI>alone,</HI> I will bring my work and sit with you as soon as I have given some necessary di∣rections: in the mean time, I will send two little companions, who will, I am sure, delight you; <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> came home a month ago on account of a fever in the school; and I have another pleasure in store for you—The sight of dear little <HI>Frances.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Frances!</HI> How am I to see her? She is ten miles off; her nurse can scarcely have brought her at this early hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, dear sir, you will not think I have presumed too much on the honor you have done me, in appoint∣ing me to be my mother's deputy, when I inform you, that I have ventured to bring <HI>Frances</HI> home, without first obtaining your permission for doing so: but indeed I found her in such a situation as I could not have <HI>left her in</HI> for the world; and I am sure you would have been angry with me if I had waited for your return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot comprehend your meaning, <HI>Jemima:</HI> the nurse was well recommended, as I understood; and the child appeared to be in a very thriving state when I last saw her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was greatly altered then indeed, sir, when I found her; and I have reason to think would have perished through neglect and bad management, if I had not been fortunate enough to call on her as I did. You know, that nurse's house is in the road from my aunt's hither, so affection led me to stop as I was com∣ing home, in order to see my little sister: but what
<PB N="6" REF="023336_0153_0FBEFD803A507B68"/>
was the surprise, both of my aunt and me, at finding the cottage door wide open, though exposed to the cold easterly wind; the floor of the room wet; several panes in the casements broken; and the dear little ba∣by lying in a cradle, as dirty as a beggar, crying in the most pitious manner imaginable? I approached the cradle with an agitation of mind not to be described, and took the dear little creature up; at the same time desiring my aunt's maid, who accompanied us, to search the house for the nurse; but her search was fruitless; at last, in the garden, she found a boy of six years old, who, it seems had been left by his mother to rock the cradle; but who, tired of his employment, had escaped to play, and left her by herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what was become of the nurse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>On enquiring in the neighbourhood, we learnt, that this inhuman woman, who had undertaken to perform a mother's part made it a daily custom to neglect her infant charge, that she might range from house to house, hearing and relating idle tales, thoughtless of the dear babe's wants, unmindful of her own obliga∣tion: so with my aunt's advice, I resolved to take her home with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, <HI>Jemima,</HI> or I shall be ready to cast reflections on your mother, who, if she was not able to nurse <HI>herself,</HI> should at least have been more circum∣spect in the choice of a substitute. If she would have done as I at first desired her, and acted a mother's part by <HI>you</HI> her <HI>eldest,</HI> I have reason to think we should have been a <HI>united happy family,</HI> for I once loved <HI>little children;</HI> and had <HI>mine</HI> been managed properly, should have placed my delight in them: but alas! I have known no comfort with them. Whilst at nurse, they were so shy, there was no inviting them to come near one; and when they returned home, they were so
<PB N="7" REF="023336_0154_0FBEFD86150AC7A0"/>
unmanageable I was glad to have them kept in the nursery, and from thence sent to school as soon as pos∣sible. But let me see the little sufferer. I am exceed∣ingly affected with the account you have given me of her. I hope she is not in danger of dying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir; my good aunt staid with us till <HI>Friday</HI> last, when she was obliged to go home for a few days; by my following her directions, <HI>Frances</HI> is quite charm∣ingly. I left her in a fine sleep, and ordered the maid to take her after breakfast into the park, from whence I suppose she is not yet returned; when she comes in I will bring her to you. In the mean time, will you permit me to fetch <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Henry?</HI> but before they make their appearance, I must confess, that I have taken advantage of being here a month before you returned from the West, and have elected myself into the office of their governess, as I thought even <HI>my poor instrustion</HI> was better then none at all. Not with∣out their consent though I assure you, sir: <HI>Catherine</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> have also done me the honor of submitting to my tuition, so that I have really a little school here. Should my dear papa find cause to give me a smile of approbation, when my young pupils exhibit their performances to him, how happy shall I think myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>

Every night did I sit up till one or two o'clock. papa insisted on my being at breakfast by eight notwithstanding, and I heard noth∣ing but grumbling all day against <HI>ladies of quality.</HI> I am sure I am so unhappy at home I know not what to do.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> FOWLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is very <HI>natural,</HI> Miss <HI>Cleveland,</HI> for young people who have tolerable good persons, to wish to appear to the best advantage, and, to keep the best company they can.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather supposed our parents made choice of those schools, from an idea that the <HI>instruction</HI> was <HI>propor∣tionable</HI> to the <HI>expence.</HI> To be sure, it is expected that every one who goes to them should make an elegant appearance; and on this account many people are of opinion, that they should be appropriated to the chil∣dren of persons whose situation in life will enable them to continue to dress them in the same manner, and give them an adequate fortune.—It is certainly a sad thing to have <HI>desires</HI> beyond one's <HI>circumstances.</HI></P>

I there∣fore intend to ask him to send me over to the <HI>East In∣dies.</HI> I doubt not but I shall make my fortune there; and instead of being obliged to make my own things, as I now do, shall have all my work done for me, and shall have slaves to wait on me, and carry me, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

Change your purpose—accommodate your mind to your circumstances: moderate your ambition. Your papa can afford to dress you as well as you <HI>ought</HI> to dress, and I dare say, is willing to do so. Can you bear the thoughts of leaving both your parents to set out on an adventure which may turn out contrary to your expectation? would it not be better to leave jewels, and other rich ornaments, to people whose rank in life require them to distinguish themselves from their inferiors, by the splendour of their attire, and to enjoy with thankfulness the blessings you already pos∣sess?</P>

<P>Unless I were an <HI>arbitray monarch,</HI> I fear I should not succeed in such an attempt, Miss <HI>Fowler.</HI> As far as <HI>example</HI> can go our present gracious queen instructs her subjects, by observing the utmost propriety and moderation in both the particulars you mention. But I am sorry to say her amiable example has not its due influence. There seems to be a general emulation among all sorts of people to outdo each other. Every rank presses upon the next above it, and by this means each seems under a kind of necessity to go beyond its proper bounds in order to preserve the distinction due to it.</P>

<P>I have, you know had the same opportunities as yourself of making intimacies with ladies of rank, and still keep up an acquaintance with some of them; but believe me, my dear, I have not the most distant wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to vie with them in appearance.

<P>I will pass over the infinuation in the latter part of your speech without resentment, <HI>Emma,</HI> though it was a very unkind one. Let us not embitter this our first meeting for a long time with any disagreeable altercation. But since you have both formed those ideas respecting your papa's fortune, which you seem to suppose inexhaustible, I think it incumbent on me to give you some information which will, I hope, make a change in your sentiments. My father's ex∣pences already exceed his income: his heart is weigh∣ed down with care on this account. If we add to this oppression, we shall perhaps see him sink into the grave. Does not duty require that each of his children should exert themselves according to their different abilitics, to lessen his disquietudes?

<P>Are you sure of what you say, <HI>Jemima?</HI> That papa has been very <HI>cross,</HI> and, as I thought, <HI>stingy,</HI> for some time past, I have with pain observed—indeed I suffered severely by this circumstance last holidays.

<P>I must beg of you, my dear, to carry your thoughts back to the time when you first came into the world, a little helpless infant; and tell me, were you then <HI>able</HI> to provide for yourself? if not, by what means have you been supplied with the necessaries of life from that time to the present hour?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will allow that it was, as you say, their indis∣censible duty; but is there no <HI>reciprocal</HI> duty on the <HI>child's part?</HI> Is there no return of affection required or fifteen years comfortable subsistence? Look down

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure we could not have provided for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own wants in the <HI>helpless state of infancy;</HI> but I never thought of this before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this may be very true; but still I think mamma has been greatly to blame in not keeping us under her <HI>own eye,</HI> and instructing us <HI>herself.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>In respect to your first objection, my dear—are you sure that your mother had strength of constitution to bear the fatigue? And in regard to the other—are you certain that she had <HI>leisure</HI> for it? Let me ask you, my dear sister—have you been suffered to grow up without the instruction suitable to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uation in life? Has no expence been bestowed on your educa∣tion? I am rather inclined to think that our dear parents have been put to many inconveniences through their desire to procure us the usual advantages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be owned that we elder ones have had a very genteel education, and were placed under a wor∣thy governess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must desire you, my dear, as I just now did <HI>Clarissa,</HI> to look down on the <HI>lower rank of life.</HI> Con∣sider the deplorable ignorance of those poor children, who are destitute of instruction; and before you pre∣sume to say again, <HI>Why did not my mamma teach me herself?</HI> ask your own heart, Whether you have been grateful to her for the benefits she has bestowed upon you? and whether you have endeavoured to repay
<PB N="25" REF="023336_0172_0FBEFDAF025CBC80"/>
them as you ought to do? Make this enquiry with impartiality, my dear, and depend upon it, you will find more reason to condemn yourself than your par∣ents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLARISLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really believe, <HI>Jemima,</HI> that if you had the <HI>worst</HI> parents in the world, you would find excuses for them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would endeavour to do so, <HI>Clarissa;</HI> for I enter∣tain the highest idea of <HI>filial duty,</HI> and cannot conceive what pleasure there can be in discovering a parent's faults. To me it appears a great crime to ferutinize their characters, unless with a view of discovering their virtues, in order to copy them. All human be∣ings are liable to error, and why should we expect our parents in particular to be exempt from them? For my part, I am firmly of opinion, that no children can delight in pointing out defects in a father or mother's conduct, who are not conscious of improprieties in their own, which they hope to excuse to the world, by throwing the blame on their parents. Pardon me, <HI>Clarissa;</HI> but if you were a little older I should really suspect from the complaints you have exhibited against yours, thet you were going to throw off their author∣ity by a <HI>clandestine marriage.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can scarcely figure to yourself a more distracted place than this house was when we came home to pass the lastholidays. Whenever it was possible for mamma to bear the fatigue of dressing she went out, but sel∣dom took us with her, because my papa objected to the expence attending our being introduced into the world; and not only to that, but really seemed to grudge mo∣ney for housekeeping. This produced dreadful alter∣cations between them. Papa would sometimes be in such violent passions that you would have been frigh∣tened to see him, and generally left the house for the whole day afterwards; and then mamma would sit and fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to such a degree, that there was no such thing as being comfortable with her. You shed tears, <HI>Jemima!</HI> what is the matter with you;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! <HI>Clarissa!</HI> how can you ask that question? Is filial affection extinguished in your heart? I hope not! rather let me suppose, that the indifference with which you speak of altercations that distress me even to hear of, arises from want of reflection. Depend on it, my dear, there must have been some very material cause for such a change in papa's temper, which is natural∣ly a very good one. A cause, which, from what I just now told you of his circumstances, you can no lon∣ger be at a loss to guess. But go on with your story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! <HI>Jemima!</HI> you affect me so that I can scarcely restrain my own tears; but I will try to proceed. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in our parents company, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Emma</HI> and I used to avoid it as much as possible. sometimes we

had whole days to ourselves; for mamma was fre∣quently too ill to leave her room, and papa from home. Not knowing how to amuse ourselves, and wanting to vent our uneasiness, we made a confident of <HI>Carter,</HI> my mamma's, woman, who aggravated every thing that appeared to us a fault either in papa or mamma's conduct; and we were persuaded to think ourselves worse treated than ever children were before.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not forward to censure you, my dear sisters, but surely affection and friendship require that I should not flatter you. I suppose, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> this base woman had some private ends of her own to answer, which induced her to act this cruel part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had; and what I am going to tell you will un∣fold them to you. I will therefore proceed to inform you, that she employed every artifice to infinuate her∣self into our good opinions, and persuaded us to come into her room, when she had company, which was al∣ways the case when mamma was out; and I assure you, that they had cards, and sometimes dancing too, and every thing in style: nay, even the inferior ser∣vants had their parties. Among Mrs. <HI>Carter's</HI> visitors was a young man of very smart appearance, who she assured me, was really a young gentleman, who had, like us, bad parents. He paid particular attention to me; and at his second visit, professed himself my lover, and Mrs. <HI>Carter</HI> informed me, that he was most des∣perately enamoured with me.</P>

<P>For my part, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> I am more inclined to <HI>pity</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>blame</HI> you.

and if it even does, surely allowance will be made for my sister's <HI>youth</HI> and <HI>inexperience.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Form no such expectations, my dear <HI>Emma!</HI> Men of such character as the author of that latter, are too vain of their conquests to conceal them; and though perhaps the fear of papa's resentment may prevent his doing it <HI>publicly;</HI> depend on it, he has hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>confi∣dence</HI> to whom he boasts of his success, and laughs at my sister's credulity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare me! for pity's sake, dear <HI>Jemima!</HI> I shall die with shame else!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>will</HI> spare you <HI>Clarissa!</HI> But indeed I never felt more angry in my life. I am hurt for the honor of the <HI>family.</HI> I am hurt for that of my <HI>sex.</HI> Let it be your study henceforth to retrieve the injury you have done to both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, it shall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Jemima!</HI> if <HI>Clarissa</HI> had been guilty of them greatest indiscretion in life, you could not say more about it than you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to find, my dear <HI>Emma.</HI> that at you early years, your mind should be insensible to that grief which every sister should feel, when so near relation deviates from the paths of rectitude. <HI>Clarissa</HI> has fortunately escaped the most dreadful consequence which might have ensued; but if you are inclined to <HI>justify her errors,</HI> you will perhaps be led to <HI>imita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her example,</HI> and may not be so happy as to come of with <HI>impunity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope she will not be so foolish: neither can I b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said to escape with <HI>impunity, Jemima.</HI> The conviction
<PB N="30" REF="023336_0177_0FBEFDB92FF4BBC0"/>
of my own mind, added to your censure, is a very severe punishment, I assure you: and then the <HI>world!</HI> I shall be afraid to go to any public place, lest I should see this man; and shall dread to enter into company, lest any one I meet there, should have heard of my indiscretion: And if the conversation should, at any time, turn upon the <HI>imprudence of young girls,</HI> I am sure my <HI>confusion</HI> will betray me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since your conscience is so fully awakened to the impropriety of your conduct, my dear, I will forbear all farther reproaches. But for the sake of <HI>Emma,</HI> who seems to think me severe in my censures, I cannot for∣bear adding, that the indiscretions, and too frequent levities in the young women of these days, arise from the want of prescribing to themselves certain rules of decorum, which nothing should tempt them to depart from. Thanks to my dear aunt's care, those princi∣ples are, I hope, so firmly rooted in my own mind, that I would on no consideration, violate them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunately for me, I have been taught no rules of decorum, any farther than the common forms of politeness extend; if there are any that I can yet practice, teach them to me, my dear sister, I entreat you; surely, though I have, for want of a kind hand to guide me, wandered out of the right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad. I have not deviated so far but I may return to again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my dear, and gladly will I afford you all the direction in my power. Favour me therefore with attention whilst I repeat to you some of those instructions which have been useful to me in the re∣gulation of my conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly, <HI>Jemima.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, my dear, that immediately on my leav∣ing
<PB N="31" REF="023336_0178_0FBEFDBC2F3382E8"/>
school, I went to live with my aunt; I was then fifteen years old; and I well remember, that the first time we were alone together, she addressed me in this manner: I promise myself great pleasure, dear <HI>Jemima,</HI> in having you for a companion, and mean to in∣troduce you as such wherever I go; but as my ac∣quaintance is large, I wish before I do so, to give you a few cautions which may preserve you from many inadvertency, fail into. In the first place, said she have a nice regard to your <HI>reputation,</HI> and with this view guard against all levity of conduct: avoid fam∣iliarity with servants; for let them be ever so faithful or just, few of them are competent judges of what delicacy and decorum require of young ladies. Be care∣ful how you form <HI>confidential</HI> friendships with persons of your own sex and age; but be still more circumspect in regard to young gentleman; encourage no freedom under the idea of <HI>romping;</HI> neither lend a willing eat to <HI>compliment,</HI> which is in general, but another name for <HI>flattery</HI> Resolve to carry on no <HI>clandesline cor∣respondence:</HI> and in order to defend your heart against forming an improper attachment, fill up those hours which you devote to reading, not with <HI>novels,</HI> but in the perusal of such books as will improve your mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was just going to say, <HI>Jemima,</HI> that I was certain from your conversation, you were no novel reader: they teach other things, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not wholly a stranger to novels, my dear; I have read some, but they were of my aunt's selecting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe that I have read all that ever were pub∣lished in the <HI>English language,</HI> and many <HI>French</HI> ones besides. <HI>Carter</HI> subscribed for us, and supplied us well, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I hope you have had enough of them, and
<PB N="33" REF="023336_0179_0FBEFDBDC5B797B0"/>
will the more readily lay them aside for books of another kind, which I shall take the liberty of recom∣mending to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible of the pernicious tendency of many no∣vels, and cannot help imputing the success of <HI>Carter's</HI> scheme, in some measure, to the examples which are there exhibited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! she was an artful creature! How, my dear <HI>Jem∣ima,</HI> could <HI>Clarissa,</HI> circumstanced as she was, avoid the artful snare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was laid for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not my intention, my dear, to say any thing father on the subject; and I fear, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> will think I must in draw an invidous comparison, if I answer your question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, <HI>Jemima,</HI> the friend and the sister shine forth in every word you say, declare your full senti∣ments on the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus called upon my dear, I will inform you what I think I should have done at least what I ought to have done: I should have endeavoured to bear with my mo∣ther fretfulness, and to avoid enercating my father's anger, by any irritating expressions, or improper beha∣viour. If these endeavours had been unsuccessful, I do not say that I could have supported the disappointment with indifference; but I would have lamented it in silence. Your making a confident of Mrs. <HI>Carter,</HI> en∣couraged her to attempt what I dare say she would not have thought of, if you had kept her at a proper dis∣tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was undoubtedly a wrong step, and I must con∣fess that instand of paying such attention to our parents as you recommend, <HI>Jemima,</HI> we used to make sharp
<PB N="34" REF="023336_0180_0FBEFDC15A8F2DD8"/>
answers; and when we were dismissed with resentment, which we had provoked, would go into <HI>Carter's</HI> room and talk over our grievances, till with the aid of her ani∣madversions, we fancied our parents the worst enemies we had in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, but I am now convinced they certainly are, as <HI>Jemima</HI> hunted, our greatest benefactors; for al∣lowing them to have been remiss in some particulars, who, besides, would have conferred such benefits upon us as they have done? Were such a poor credu∣lous girl as I to be abandoned by my parents, what might be my lot? I lately foolishly wished to forsake their house; to throw myself into the power of a stranger, with an idea of being my own mistress; but I am resol∣ved to follow, in future, your plan, my dear sister, as far as I have opportunity of doing, and hope to repair my fault to my father by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obedience for the remainder of my life. What would I give, could I do the same by my another! O! my dear <HI>Jemima!</HI> if she <HI>dies,</HI> I shall feel <HI>remorse</HI> as long as I live, for the uneasiness which, I fear I gave her when she was ill able to bear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>If such are your regrets, my dear, for smaller offences, what would have been your feelings had you married without the consent of your parents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, indeed! But I never considered the matter be∣fore. I thought I could plead their <HI>example</HI> as an excuse, and concluded, that they could do no less than forgive me on that account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not believe, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> that if you had married Mrs. <HI>Carter's</HI> relation, papa would ever have owned him for a son-in-law: all our relations would have contemned such a mean alliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with <HI>justice,</HI> my dear; for in marriages regard
<PB N="36" REF="023336_0181_0FBEFDC75D747760"/>
should be had to <HI>equality of rank</HI> for many reasons. But let us chuse <HI>another subject.</HI> I should really be ashamed were any body to overhear such young persons as us con∣versing <HI>on this.</HI> Before we think of <HI>marrying</HI> let us endeavour to acquit ourselves well in our present relations of life. Let us, my dears, strive to fulfil the duties of <HI>daughters</HI> and <HI>sisters.</HI> Let us learn the rules of <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomy</HI> and <HI>good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Perfect ourselves in the virtues of <HI>submission, meekness.</HI> and <HI>patience;</HI> and adorn our minds with every branch of <HI>useful knowledge,</HI> before we venture to form important connections, in which, if we are not possessed of those qualifications, and do not practice those virtues, we shall certainly be unhappy, and the cause of unhappiness to others. But the interesting conversation we have been engaged in, has made us forget the dear children. You promised to go up to them again, <HI>Clarissa</HI> and <HI>Emma.</HI></P>

<P>Surely you jest with us, <HI>Jemima!</HI> and only mean to make us feel our own deficiencies?</P>

<P>Can you suspect me of so <HI>ungenerous</HI> a design? No, my dear sisters, I wish on the contrary to call into action those abilities which I know your possess; and give you opportunities of testifying your gratitude and affection to our good father, who will, I am confident reward your endeavours to please him, with such a degree of paternal love as you have never yet experienced.

<P>This plan, my dear, may do very well for a little while; but <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> must go on with the <HI>Classics,</HI> and there you cannot teach them [<HI>after a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</HI>] But surely I can instruct them myself; for the present, I will do so, and when we are settled, get a private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tor for them; I will write this day to Mrs. <HI>Atkinson,</HI> the curate's wife, and entreat the favour of her to hire a set of servants; and honest <HI>Mary,</HI> the gardener's wife, who at present takes care of the house, can, by the direction of Mrs. <HI>Atkin∣son,</HI> get it in order for us. I will let her live in a little lodge which was originally built for the gardener's resi∣dence. What furniture is wanted for mine may be sent from hence; and we will soon bid adieu to this racket∣ing town, in which I have found but little real enjoy∣ment.</P>

<P>Do you know who that <HI>French</HI> gentleman is, sister, who is now in the study with papa? I met <HI>John</HI> in the

<P>Have you communicated your scheme to papa, <HI>Je∣mima?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, my dear, and he readily agrees to our putting it in execution. You and <HI>Clarissa</HI> are to leave school, and the little ones to be educated at home, as we pro∣posed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it with all my heart. By retiring into the country, I shall, I hope, escape the mortification of hav∣ing my indiscretion made public; and flatter myself I shall establish a good reputation in the neighbourhood I am going to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>By assisting you in the instruction of the children, <HI>Je∣mima,</HI> we shall be likely to keep up our <HI>French, Geogra∣phy, Embroidery,</HI> and other things, which we have learnt at school. Then I am delighted with the idea of the dan∣ces you have promised us, and the hopes, that amongst our neighbours we may find some agreeable companions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say we shall; and I suppose we can have mas∣ters to give us farther instruction; for there is a capital ladies school within two miles of our house.</P>

<P>Are you coming up to the children, <HI>Jemima? Catha∣rine</HI> and <HI>Sophia,</HI> seem quite tired of working. I was desired to ask you, how you wish them to be employ∣ed?</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was my intention that they should take a little walk
<PB N="43" REF="023336_0189_0FBEFDD771A30BE8"/>
in the Park till dinner-time; but I cannot conveniently attend them, as I am in hopes my father will return and relieve my mind from its present anxiety. Will you <HI>Emma,</HI> have the goodness to accompany them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon condition that you will send for me as soon as you know what news the <HI>French</HI> gentleman has brought of mamma. Shall <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> go with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, if they are not already tired with walking; but if they are so, or have fixed upon some other amusement, you had best not interrupt them. I have promised them a holiday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose, <HI>Emma,</HI> that nurse carries <HI>Frances</HI> with you? The dear little creature seems to know me already, <HI>Jemi∣ma!</HI> I hope she will be fond of me: you cannot think how diverted she has been with some of <HI>Emma's</HI> droll tricks.</P>

observed in me, proceeded not from <HI>sorrow,</HI> but <HI>excess of joy.</HI> I must make you, my dear girls, my <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents</HI> on this occasion. Your prudence will teach you not to repeat our conversation to the younger children.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear sir, I am not equal to the task of read∣ing it <HI>aloud.</HI></P>

<P>Then give it me again my love, I am more compo∣sed now.</P>
<P>[<HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eads,</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE the pleasure to inform you, my dear, that I already find great benefit from the salubrious air of this mild climate. The fever has left me; my cough is almost gone; my appetite restored; and the physician flatters me, that in another month, I may be in a condition to return to my native country. I cannot doubt but that <HI>humanity</HI> will incline you to <HI>rejoice</HI> at the prospect of my recovery: happy should I be, could you do so from a higher motive! That my children also could delight in the restoration of a mother! but, alas! fear the life of dissipation which I have led for many years, careless of domestic duties, has eradicated your affection for me, and prevented the growth of theirs. Permit me, however, to assure you, that my illness has awakened those reflections, which, till lately, I have not allowed myself <HI>time</HI> to in∣dulge; and my resolution is formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> begin a new course of life, and to seek for happiness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my own fami∣ly. I could wish at my return to <HI>England,</HI> to retire to <HI>B</HI>—;as I fear a town life will overset my constitution again; and country air will be necessary to complete my recovery. It would be a great pleasure to me to have my family with me; and I hope to be indulged with the little ones atleast. I beg that <HI>Frances</HI> may be taken from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>Now you have heard the letter, <HI>Jemima,</HI> can you wonder at my emotion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, sir, I cannot. My mother's happy recovery, and her desire for <HI>retirement,</HI> are so agreeable to our wish∣es, that I am delighted beyond expression!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to describe to you the present sensations of my heart. I know, I feel, that I shall be happy with my family. If I do not mistake my own disposition, <HI>nature</HI> has formed me for a <HI>domestic character;</HI> for though <HI>fash∣ion</HI> and <HI>folly</HI> have tempted me to deviate from her paths, I have secretly <HI>despised</HI> the very amusements I have ap∣peared to promote: and could I but have had a <HI>happy home,</HI> should long ago have forsaken them. Not that I mean at this time to reflect on your mother. I have been at least as blameable as she. A <HI>steady resolution,</HI> enfor∣ced with <HI>good humour</HI> on my part, would I dare say, have had its due influence on her.</P>

<P>Spare us the pain, dear sir, of being witnesses to your <HI>self-reproaches.</HI> Permit us to retire; when you are more composed we will wait on you again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my love, stay. There has been one material er∣ror in my conduct, which I am desirous of pointing out to you as a <HI>warning;</HI> for though I hope you are not in im∣mediate danger, no one knows what temptations may fall in your way. The fault I allude to was ain <HI>inconsid∣erate precipitate marriage without the consent of parents.</HI> That my <HI>example</HI> may not be an encouragement to any of you to be guilty of the same fault, let me tell <HI>you</HI> now, as I shall your <HI>brothers</HI> and <HI>sisters</HI> at a proper age, that I regard it as the source of all the unhappiness of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assure yourself, dear sir, I never will entertain a thought

<P>[<HI>Miss</HI> Clarissa <HI>appears confused, but strives to conceal it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say this, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> because I have the least dis∣trust, either of you or <HI>Jemima;</HI> my only design is by my <HI>advice,</HI> to furnish you with an <HI>antidote</HI> against the <HI>contagi∣on of my example.</HI> I would not wish that any child of mine should feel the same kind of pangs which I have selt, and therefore must tell you the <HI>first consequences</HI> of this rash step; the <HI>succeeding ones</HI> you have, without doubt, <HI>yourselves</HI> observed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You are very good, sir! but indeed this subject is too painful to me.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amiable creature! Hear me this once, <HI>Jemima!</HI> My heart is so full I must relieve it. I cannot be satisfied if I do not. It is certainly my duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. CLEVELAND:</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, if it must be so, I obey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was, my dear, the second son of my father, who pos∣sessed, as you know, a considerable estate; but as I had an elder brother and four sisters, my expectations of for∣tune were moderate, and my father intended me for the bar. With a view to my advancement in life, he placed me with an eminent batri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er. This gentleman had two daughters, the eldest (your good aunt <HI>Jemima</HI>) having lost her mother, lived with a relation; but the youngest was kept as a parlour boarder at one of the first schools in <HI>England;</HI> she, however, came home occasionally, and at those recesses I became acquainted with her, and the consequence of our acquaintance was an elopement to <HI>Scotland.</HI> This journey quite exhausted my finances;
<PB N="47" REF="023336_0193_0FBEFDDD529971B0"/>
and being entirely at a loss how to provide for our future subsistence, we were under the necessity of throwing our∣selves at the feet of our parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon the interruption, sir; but what must have been the distess both of you and mamma, when you came into the presence of your parents, after taking so important a step, without their knowledge and consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Greater than you can imagine, my dear. Their just reproaches were like daggers to our hearts. My wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e's father, being a man of the nicest honor was at first inexo∣rable, for he seared the world would suspect him of being privy to the match; and mine treated me with a coolness which the consciousness of having deserved it rend∣ered doubly afflicting; however, he kindly continued the sum he had allotted for my annual allowance, with some addition; and then my father-in-law was induced to give my wife a small portion. We took a little house in town: and had we understood domestic oeconomy, might have lived very comfortably; but instead of re∣doubling my assiduities at the law, I entirely neglected my studies; and your mother having no judgment in respect to the expenditure of money, was liable to numberless impositions; this, added to a taste for public diversions, which we foolishly substituted for domestic pleasures, in∣volved us in a variety of difficulties, [<HI>Miss</HI> Clarissa <HI>bursts into tears.</HI> My dear <HI>Clarissa,</HI> why are you so greatly af∣fected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed my good sir, my feelings are very great as well as <HI>Clarissa's.</HI> The idea of what our parents must have suf∣fered is enough to awaken the tenderest emotion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear girls, I will hasten to a conclusion of my story. To add to our embarrassment a young family came on. I wished your mother to nurse you herself, <HI>Jemima;</HI> but some of her fashionable acquaintance per∣suaded
<PB N="48" REF="023336_0194_0FBEFDDED716A8E8"/>
her, that it would ruin her health, and confine her constantly at home, so she was prevailed on to put you to nurse. And thus was one of the greatest delights in life, that of <HI>enjoying our children in their infancy,</HI> turned out of doors; for every succeeding child was, like you, consigned to the care of a stranger; two we buried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, sir, but that, notwithstanding we were put to nurse, both you and my dear mother had a great deal of care and trouble, as well as expence on our account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had indeed, my dear. After we had been married seven years, my elder brother died of a fever, and I be∣came my father's heir; he lived but six months after his son, and, with his dying breath, urged me to leave the idle course of life I was in, and pass my time like a <HI>chris∣tian.</HI> I fully intended to obey him; but both your mo∣ther and I found it difficult to shake off our old compan∣ions, who enticed us on from day to day, till having mo∣ney at command, we became more dissipated than ever; fortunately, neither of us had any taste for gaming, or we might have totally ruined our family. The events of this day have recalled to my mind my father's dying injunc∣tions, which I am resolved, though late to fultil.—O! my dear, my honored parent! how does my heart reproach me for ingratitude to your memory!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear sir, you afflict yourself beyond measure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> my remorse, though great, is not equal to my offences. <HI>Obedience to parents</HI> is one of the first of moral duties; no one can violate it without offending their <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> whose representatives our <HI>earthly parents</HI> are to us. Nay, disobedience naturally leads to the breach of other duties. Had I been a good son, and followed my father's early advice, which was to <HI>settle my principles, establish a good character,</HI> and <HI>have a prospect of providing for a family before I thought of marrying,</HI> I
<PB N="49" REF="023336_0195_0FBEFDE147094500"/>
think I should have been an affectionate husband and a tender father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have always considered you as such, sir, and as such will ever revere you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Henceforth you shall find me all a parent should be; but I lose the thread of my narration. After my fathers death, my fortune was very considerable; but neither your mother or I had used ourselves to any calculations; and as our family increased, expences increased, so that for some time past, I have lived beyond it, and have been under the necessity of borrowing money on a mortgage. However, the prudent plan you have proposed, my dear <HI>Jemima,</HI> will I think, in a few years bring my affairs round, and I hope to live in such a manner as to give my chil∣dren cause to bless me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>We already do, my dear, my honored parent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARISSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, <HI>Jemima,</HI> I am so fully convinced, that happiness depends on the proper discharge of the <HI>domes∣tic virtues,</HI> that I resolve from this day to make them my study; and never will I again think of marrying, till I have qualified myself to fill the offices of <HI>wife, mother,</HI> and <HI>mistress of a family.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my dear, you may, with great probability of success, promise yourself the attainment of the happiness you aspire to. Would every young woman form such a resolution, and abide by it, I have reason to think, there would be few <HI>indifferent husbands</HI> and <HI>careless fathers.</HI> However, let <HI>us</HI> make the experiment. If we acquit ourselves properly as <HI>daughters</HI> and <HI>sisters.</HI> we shall at least form no <HI>improper connections;</HI> neither shall we be in danger of <HI>deviating</HI> from the <HI>paths of propriety,</HI> while we fill up our time with <HI>useful employments.</HI></P>

<P>THE TRIUMPH OF REASON, AND THE CONTRAST,</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB N="2" REF="023336_0198_0FBEFB0753B7E5B8"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IN the first of those <HI>Dramatic Pieces,</HI> which constitute the present volume, I have endeavoured to point out the <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>odiousness</HI> of <HI>pride,</HI> the <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>amiable∣ness</HI> of <HI>humility,</HI> and the advantages which may be deri∣ved from the different acquirements of a liberal education, in <HI>a state of adversity.</HI> In the second, an attempt is made to exhibit a striking <HI>contrast</HI> between the manners of a daughter, brought up under the tuition of a sensible and tender mother, and those of a poor young creature, who is supposed to have been vanished by a mistaken parent to a foreign land, where she wasted some of her most valuable years in the acquisition of <HI>vanity, conceit</HI> and <HI>pertness,</HI> under the idea of <HI>politeness</HI> and <HI>refinement.</HI></P>
<P>It is really wonderful to think, how parents can thus bring themselves to send their children from under the eye of tenderness, and watchful solicitude? At <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> years of age, many girls are separated from every relation or friend, who would kindly correct their growing errors, and are placed as boarders in <HI>convents.</HI> It is the interest of the Superiors to send the most flattering accounts of the dispositions and improvements of those committed to their care. The mother is naturally precluded from any knowledge of the real <HI>truth,</HI> neither can she ascertain the treatment which her child meets with, who is subimitted to the <HI>chance</HI> of becoming the object of <HI>ill-natured severi∣ty,</HI> without an affectionate friend to soothe her affliction, or redress her grievances. But these are trifling conside∣rations, in comparison with a still greater danger to which children, sent for education to a <HI>catholic country,</HI> are ex∣posed. That of imbibing the principles of an <HI>erroneous</HI> and <HI>superstitious religion;</HI> one great <HI>tenet</HI> of which is <HI>the merit of making converts.</HI> How then can it be expected, that the zealous professors of it, with forbear employing their endeavours to bias those tender minds which are
<PB N="3" REF="023336_0199_0FBEFB08B05F8F68"/>
thus exposed to their delusions? but allowing that the persons entrusted with the children of <HI>Protestants</HI> are <HI>true to their trust:</HI> what better can be expected, than that their <HI>pupils</HI> return home without <HI>any religion at all?</HI></P>
<P>Having in this volume brought my work to a conclu∣sion, I must entreat my Readers to consider it, as parti∣cularly intended for <HI>young ladies just entering into the world,</HI> who are supposed to be preparing themselves for those relations in life, which it is natural for them to look forward to. For <HI>their</HI> benefit only, have I been induced to bring forth to view, the <HI>faults of parents.</HI> I hope it will appear, from the execution of my plan, that nothing is farther from my design than the exciting in young fe∣male minds, <HI>premature thoughts</HI> of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>marriage;</HI> though I do not agree in opinion with many parents, who would on no account converse on those subjects with their daughters, till they are just entering the marriage state. Under proper regulations they ought frequently to be referred to, so far, I mean, as is necessary to point out the errors which prove fatal to the happiness of numbers, that young ladies may know, before they engage in the most important connections of life, the danger of <HI>impro∣per conduct;</HI> and be qualified when they have an oppor∣tunity of marrying with a good prospect, and the full con∣sent of their friends, to make a "well ordered home, their husbands best delight."To instruct their children, govern their servants, and regulate their expences; in∣stead of fancying, as is too frequently the case with the <HI>modern fair,</HI> that when they leave school they have no∣thing to do but to <HI>display</HI> their <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>accomplishments,</HI> to <HI>adorn their persons,</HI> in order to gain admiration, and <HI>to run the giddy round of incessant amusement.</HI> Wretch∣ed must be the man who calls such an one his <HI>wise!</HI> mis∣erable the lot of her <HI>neglected children<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am at present very busy in making the children's things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is an employment in which you will never re∣ceive any assistance from me; I should not have thought of troubling myself about a parcel of tiresome bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were once a little brat, as you call it, yourself; what would have become of you if every body had been of your opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, but I was the eldest, and a rarity—and had people
<PB N="6" REF="023336_0202_0FBEFB14B6384B78"/>
now to wait upon me? and so ought my brothers and sisters to have—for mamma cannot reasonably expect that I should throw my time away upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, how do we in all companies hear Miss <HI>True-worth</HI> praised; because she takes so much pains with her brothers and sisters, and teaches them every thing they learn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may do very well for her, who has no great for∣tune to boast of—but my papa, though he is a <HI>tradesman,</HI> has money enough for a <HI>lord;</HI> and my aunt told me, he could make us as rich as <HI>ladies.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, but mamma teaches a different lesson; she says, we had better be <HI>good</HI> than <HI>great,</HI> and that <HI>hu∣mility</HI> is a most amiable virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know the reason of that? because she herself had no fortune, but was a pennyless colonel's daughter, and, therefore, as my aunt told me, she despises money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure mamma is the most agreeable woman I ever saw. She is so gentle and kind to every one, I think it very strange that my aunt should have spoken against her, and to her own child too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see much harm in what my aunt said. When my papa consented to my living with her, she endeavour∣ed to eradicate many sentiments which differed from her own; It was natural for her to try to persuade me to think like herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. But I know your going to live with her was contrary to mamma's inclination, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have of∣ten seen her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am only sorry my poor aunt died, which obliged me
<PB N="5" REF="023336_0203_0FBEFB1638386520"/>
to return home, for I shall never be so happy again as I was with her. Mamma confines me and will not let me have a variety of fine cloaths. I was forced to get at papa alone, and coax him to consent to our going to Monsieur <HI>De Fierville'</HI>s ball, and to allow us new dresses for the occasion; and I can perceive that mamma is dis∣pleased because I have gained my point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie! <HI>Matilda,</HI> you accuse my dear mother very wrongfully; indeed she is delighted to give us pleasure under proper restrictions; and surely she must be a bet∣ter judge of propriety than either you or I can pretend to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so; but her notions are very strange. The other day she chid me for not giving Mrs. <HI>Molly,</HI> the housemaid an answer. Why, I cannot think there is any necessity for shewing civility to such sort of people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I should be ashamed of treating them otherwise than civilly. Whilst they do their duty, they have a right to our regard; and the best method of insuring res∣pect from them, is setting a good example, which can∣not be done without feeling both for them and ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I always treated my aunt's servants just as I pleased, and they were forced to submit to it: som times I made them play with me, and at other times, used them as ill as ever I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be ashamed, even if mamma permitted it, to act so by any body inferior to me; if they are <HI>honest,</HI> they are as good as I am, and much more <HI>necessary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So are the cat and the dog, I consider them all on a footing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christians to be looked on in such a light! indeed sis∣ter,
<PB N="6" REF="023336_0204_0FBEFB17B8AAFD10"/>
you shock me. I never made <HI>companions</HI> of the ser∣vants; but if they behaved well, always thought them full as worthy as myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do not I: but you have no <HI>spirit.</HI> I suppose, the other afternoon, you would have submitted to Miss <HI>Foley</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting above us; yet I soon sent the lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o her proper station.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confess the truth, I never was so much confused in my life as at your conduct on that occasion; for I am sure, <HI>Harriet Foley</HI> would not for the world, be guilty of rudeness to any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What business had she to set herself <HI>above me?</HI> I shall always act so by every body I think beneath me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma sets us a very different example; and yet she is every where treated with great respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure does not <HI>money make the man;</HI> and has not mamma an elegant coach, a great house and riches enough to outdo most of her neighbours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she does not plume herself upon these advantages. You know, <HI>"the humble shall be exalted."</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And <HI>"the exalted may be abased for me."</HI> I shall never think of such precepts while I am <HI>rich, poor</HI> I cannot be; for I know my aunt left me handsomely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard so much about <HI>rickes</HI> before; my mam∣ma has always armed my mind to bear a <HI>reverse</HI> of for∣tune, and I think papa must have had great losses lately, or he would not have discharged several servants, and given up his house in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be horrid indeed, if he reduces his circumstan∣ces;
<PB N="7" REF="023336_0205_0FBEFB196CF59520"/>
though it will not trouble me, for he must always support me as I have been used to live; I cannot submit to a <HI>reverse.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a great shame if we murmured at any em∣ployment which my mamma sets us the example of. To save her trouble, I offered to make these frocks, as the maid, who used to work for the children, is one of those who are discharged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One comfort is, I do not know how either to make or mend, and I am not ambitious of learning, believe me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw my mamma at such employment till very lately, yet she does it with as much cheerfulness as em∣broidery, or any other fancy work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, <HI>I hate work,</HI> nor <HI>will</HI> I do any. My aunt never made me, and why should any other per∣son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I cannot bear <HI>idleness.</HI> My mamma's example has taught me to love employment, and I am by that means, free from the danger of having my time ever hang heavi∣ly on my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have found time sadly heavy since my return home, but never did so at my aunt's; for there I used, when tired of the <HI>parlour,</HI> to go into the <HI>kitchen,</HI> or <HI>garden,</HI> and make the servants romp with me; but now it is in vain to speak to a domestic, for they have orders not to hold conversation, or be more with me than their business re∣quires, on pain of losing their places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wasted time in passing it so unprofitably; the attention to my education, mamma's conversation, and playing with the little ones, fills up all my hours without leaving a moment to spare. Apropos, have you seen the

<STAGE>[She takes them from a large port folio, and spreads them on the table.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>They look pretty; but I do not understand any thing about painting, nor can I discover what use there is in young ladies of fortune knowing how to draw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the pleasantest employment imaginable, and assists us in discerning the bountiful goodness of our Creator, who gave us such beautiful flowers and plants to gratify our senses of seeing and smelling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not <HI>like</HI> flowers, and therefore never regard them; indeed, the <HI>very sweet ones</HI> make me <HI>faint.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are some too powerfully fragrant for a room, but in the open air their odours are delightful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk very affectedly on this subject, I think; pray who taught you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My ever dear mamma, she is never tired of studying the beauties of nature, nor I of being instructed by her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you cannot paint from the flowers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do; and am so entertained, that it is with re∣gret I leave off. Try to draw, sister, and you will be as fond of it as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could never discover one charm in any thing that re∣quired taking pains, and shall not begin now. I had masters, but would not attend to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mamma was my instructress: perhaps, had you been taught by her, your aversion to learning would have ceased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="023336_0207_0FBEFB217216A990"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not. For with all mamma's hoasted clever∣ness, I cannot suppose her quite so capable of teaching as masters are who gain their livelihood by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>She might not be <HI>more capable,</HI> but I see no reason to doubt her being on an <HI>equality</HI> with them; what <HI>one</HI> per∣son can learn, <HI>another</HI> may; and it is visible that my mamma is elegantly accomplished, though she only shews it for the advantage of her children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whence you infer, that you are as clever as any young lady can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You pervert my meaning strangely, <HI>Matilda.</HI> I hope I am not so conceited; but if my capacity is a good one, I see no reason why I may not improve as well under my mamma's tuition as under any master's whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma has done one thing to gratify herself, she has taught you to have as high an opinion of her cleverness as she has; my aunt instructed me otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>We seem to differ on a very material point, and there∣fore had better never mention it again. I reverence my mother, she is kindness itself; I never yet saw any per∣son equal to her; but that probably i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> owing to my not having opportunity of observing other people's actions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o clearly as I do her's.

<P>I was detained at Lady <HI>Jenkins'</HI>s longer than I expect∣ed; her ladyship was kind enough to beg of me, as a fa∣vor, to stay half an hour for her; how then could I re∣fuse? Yet I beg your pardon, ladies, if it has materially interfered with your employment, I am sincerely sorry for it.</P>

<P>I am not sufficiently accustomed to fashionable dress to be a competent judge; but it appears, in my eyes, very complete indeed. However, my mamma is the properest person to determine, and she is in her dressing room: had you not better go to her, <HI>Matilda?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>

<P>You do indeed strangely mistake the matter, my dear <HI>Matilda,</HI> to think stooping to dependence less mean, than engaging in an honest employment.

<P>Why am I to blame for not working, when there is no occasion for me to do it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least you are to blame, for despising, and treating with hautiness, a worthy amiable woman, only because she makes your gowns. A woman who was better <HI>born</HI> and as <HI>well educated</HI> as yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My aunt always judged as I do. She never liked any body that was <HI>poor,</HI> because she thought them <HI>mean.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meanness is not a necessary attendant on poverty. Your aunt is dead, and her faults ought to be buried in oblivion. Truly am I concerned, that through the nar∣rowness of her mind, she has so greatly contracted your's: yet, I hope, precept and observation, will overcome the prejudices of education.—Would your father's becoming poor make me less a gentlewoman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you <HI>doubt.</HI> Let me, therefore, endeavour to convince your <HI>reason,</HI> by relating two examples of people personality known to you. To begin with Mrs. <HI>Gates,</HI> her husband was a gentleman of fortune but unhappily fond of <HI>shew</HI> and <HI>parade;</HI> he lived to squander away his whole estate, among people who only despised, though they assist∣ed to ruin him; as his death she was left destitute with three
<PB N="15" REF="023336_0213_0FBEFB2FC62F5020"/>
young children. All her acquaintance of high rank for∣sook her; some few friends remained, but they were such as you would call <HI>mean,</HI> because they were not <HI>rich.</HI> These solicited relief for her, from her husband's former inti∣mates. They all turned a deaf ear, except one great lady, who offered to give her the run of her house, that is to <HI>feed her;</HI> in return for which, she was to <HI>flatter</HI> her <HI>absur∣dities,</HI> and even her <HI>vices.</HI> Her children were to be put out to service as they grew up.

<P>As you relate it, Mrs. <HI>Gates</HI> is undoubtedly the best, and the happiest. But if my <HI>papa</HI> were to lose his fortune, I do not know what would become of <HI>me,</HI> for I am cer∣tain I could not follow her example.</P>

<P>It cannot be pleasing to you young as you are, to dwell upon such a thought. Yet [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghs</HI>] it is a misfortune very likely to happen. Your papa carries on an extensive trade, and his success depends more frequently on others, or even on the uncertain elements, than on himself. It is therefore the duty of all connected with him to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m their minds for a reverse; and I would wish you to con∣sider things in a proper light, that you may be strengthened to support a misfortune, which it will probably be your portion to bear.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to resolve on but <HI>submission.</HI> We know not the extent of our lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ALLWORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have still the support of hope; and even should the worst happen, Mr. <HI>Freeman</HI> has so active a mind, that he will never rest until he is in a situation to retrieve his losses, and regain his fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You comfort me agreeably. And, indeed, I believe he will pursue fortune, as long as life is spared. Men in business, with active minds, seldom give up. I know too well the value of money to despise it.

<P>Be much concerned to be sure; but it would be for the <HI>cause</HI> of the disappointment; as nothing but a <HI>misfor∣tune</HI> to some of the family could occasion it: for papa and mamma are so indulgent to us, that they would not suffer a tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to prevent our enjoyment of such a plea∣sure.</P>

<P>Tell me honestly, <HI>Matilda,</HI> do not you wish you had employed yourself usefully this afternoon, instead of throwing your time away in so trifling a manner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I do, because then I should not have hurt my dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does it not teach you the necessity of never being <HI>idle?</HI> had you assisted <HI>Clara</HI> in attending to the young one's, you would not have had any time to mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣ploy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I could acquire a relish for employment it would be a comfort to me. What can I do mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take pleasure in <HI>reading, writing, working,</HI> and if you have <HI>taste,</HI> apply to the several accomplishments, so ad∣mirable in most of your acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should never have time to do so much, nor is there I think a necessity for it, at least for <HI>working,</HI> because the servants can be employed about that; and as for <HI>writing,</HI> what use is that of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my opinion, nothing marks a gentlewoman more than excelling in both; <HI>writing,</HI> is indeed, particu∣larly necessary, as even from a note you may judge of the education of the person who executed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ALLWORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and it is a qualification that excites a great deal of <HI>prais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which ought to be an inducement for acquiring it. Indeed, I would rather a child of mine could <HI>work</HI> and <HI>write</HI> well, than excel in what are peculiarly termed <HI>accomplishments;</HI> though even the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter are so essential
<PB N="28" REF="023336_0226_0FBEFB49ACD9C020"/>
to a <HI>polite education,</HI> that I should be sorry to see the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wanting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I could only write and work, what could I do to as∣sist mamma, in case of her being reduced to poverty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ALLWORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had not been better instructed, more could not be expected from you, but we may hope to reap great benefit, where great pains have been bestowed.</P>

<P>I have had more masters than my sister without know∣ing half so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ALLWORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been unfortunate my dear, and bred up by an aunt who indulged you without considering the in∣jury she did to your future prospects; with your good sense, I think, all that may be easily overcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing appears <HI>new</HI> to me, and I am quite bewil∣dered. Mamma seems perfectly good and kind to me, and still I feel under a restraint before her which I never experienced with my aunt; what can be the meaning of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, dear girl, I am anxiosly solicitous for your welfare, and for that reason, lament your being edu∣cated by your aunt. I need not say, that her sentiments did not accord with mine. The difference of our <HI>birth,</HI> made the difference of <HI>opinion.</HI> Life flowed smoothly with <HI>her,</HI> she had no trials, and possessed an income that insured her respect and adulation. I have experienced a very contrary fortune, and was early initiated in scenes of sorrow. My father being an officer, felt distress himself, and pitied it in many who belonged to our regiment. No tongue can describe the scenes of woe I have witness∣ed; the more melancholy, because the objects were <HI>good</HI> and <HI>brave.</HI> By these, my heart has been softened, and though by my marriage, I have been in very affluant cir∣cumstances
<PB N="29" REF="023336_0227_0FBEFB4AC04B6C98"/>
I could never forget the poverty of my for∣mer companions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be ashamed to expose my ignorance, or I would begin taking pains about something; but the worst is, I am equally unknowing in every thing, and therefore have no hopes of ever regaining lost time.</P>

<P>Let us forget that distinction, dear girl! the difference of our ages is small, and I have never been separated from mamma's instruction and example.</P>

<P>I begin to honor and love my dear mother, as much as you do. Her mildness has convinced my reason; had she exerted any violence, I am certain she would have found me obstinate, though I must confess greatly against my own interest.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Parents may sometimes be wrong, yet I never could bear to hear them found fault with by their children, and always avoided the company of those who fell into that error.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, I am convinced; that thought never struck me before, but I did not give myself time to con∣sider much about any thing; however, I shall become a new being. But do you think, <HI>Clara,</HI> mamma will ever love me as well as she does you?</P>

<P>I have indeed something of the first consequence to mention, which has kept me from sleeping all night. It is about my new cloaths; you know I can never <HI>wear</HI> them <HI>now,</HI> and it will be a sad pity for papa to pay for them when he is in such distress, and besides they will be useless.

<P>Depend on it, my love, every thing in my power you may command.</P>

<P>Listen to me then with patience. I think it my duty to assist my papa and mamma as far as my power goes—will not you agree with me in that?</P>

<P>To a very <HI>good</HI> point, as you shall hear. My cap. there is no doubt of the milliner's readily taking again, and so I dispose of my <HI>ornaments,</HI> which are the last I shall ever have. But my harpsichord and music will surely afford a small sum of money, which would in an emergency be very acceptable; the motive of my selling them, without the knowledge of my parents, is for fear their tenderness for me should oppose it. What use can music be of to me, who must work for my bread? It would be ridiculous you know, Mrs. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> in such a situation, to display any <HI>fashionable accomplishments.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ALLWORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am delighted with the dutiful attention you pay to the present unhappiness of your worthy father and mo∣ther, whose distress would be more supportable but for

the consideration of their children. I esteem you for thinking so deeply, and hope the same solicitude will in∣fluence every future action of your life, which relates to them; but I cannot agree with you, that it is right to take any steps, though for the relief of your parents, without their knowledge and concurrence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, madam, I would not, on any <HI>common oc∣casion,</HI> presume to act without their consent; but this is so <HI>peculiar a circumstance.</HI> It is selling what can no lon∣ger be of <HI>use,</HI> and is, besides, <HI>my own,</HI> for my uncle gave me the instrument when I was a very little girl.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FOLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very <HI>impertinent</HI> in your manner, <HI>Matilda;</HI> but people who mix with their <HI>inferiors,</HI> must expect to meet impertinence. Come <HI>Harriot,</HI> let us go; or do you in∣tend to stay crying over these girls all day?</P>

<P>You should also rejoice in <HI>my adversity;</HI> for it has done me more good than riches possibly could have done.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? it is my intentions to accept her invitation to night, and at all proper times; not only to shew to her that I am <HI>above</HI> resenting her treatment, but also, that the sight of her may remind me of my own faults, and with a secret hope, that the change in my conduct, may effect an alteration in her's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ALLWORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You judge nobly my dear girl. Continue to think thus, and <HI>false pride,</HI> the <HI>bane of peace,</HI> will not endanger the loss of your future repose. Well, <HI>Clara,</HI> will you list∣en to my admonitions in future? was not my advice bet∣ter to follow than your own.</P>

<P>GOOD morning to you, my dear grandmamma, I hope you rested well last night, and feel no remains of the rheumatic pains you complained of?</P>

<P>Thank you, my dear girl, I am as well as I can expect to he at my late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of life, though I have still the same pains flying about me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN, [<HI>who sits down.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for it. Is your breakfast as you like it? your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> does not look so nice as usual; you do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> you had better, if you please, make another.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is very grateful to my feelings; but in∣deed my maid has done every thing as usual. It is not wonderful that appetite of an old woman near eighty

<P>What would I give that I could by any means remove some of your infirmities? then my dear grandmamma might enjoy herself abroad as I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly. Health is certainly one of the greatest blessings we can possess; but unfortunately, we seldom know how to price it, till lost by our own mismanagement. The <HI>youthful</HI> too generally imagine they shall never be <HI>old;</HI> and therefore throw away the most precious part of their lives in folly and dissipation, which occasions con∣stant regret for mispent time, and embitters all their latter years. My comfort is, that I feel only the natural infir∣mities of age; my conscience does not reproach me on this head.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often wondered, my dear grandmamma, to think how it is possible for you to be so cheerful who are always in pain, and neither can visit or be much visited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many circumstances conduce to my cheerfulness. My Creator, as one of his bountiful gifts, has endowed me with an active mind, in consequence of which, I have acquired a habit of constant employment. But above all, the reliance which a long life has taught me to place on my Maker, naturally produces serenity of mind; and I look back with satisfaction on the days that are past, as I trust, guided by his unerring hand, I have not spent them <HI>unprofitably.</HI> I am sure I have not <HI>unthankfully.</HI> The blessings I enjoy are manifold. Misfortunes I have sha∣red with the rest of mankind. Grateful and resigned, I wait for the moment of my dissolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, however, that your life will be spared many years longer; for I have a great deal to learn; and though my mamma is all goodness, yet she has not so much time for conversation as you have; besides, it would break my heart to be separated from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON, [<HI>smiling.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<P>The heart, my dear, is not so ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y <HI>broken</HI> as you ima∣gine; great and heavy have been my afflictions. My mind was naturally weak, and apt to repine at every dis∣appointment, this my parents early observed, their kind attention to me strengthened it; they soon convinced me, that a dependance on this world is vain, and taught me to draw confolation from that source which never fails. At what time may we expect the travellers? are you not impatient to see your cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I am. Mamma told me at parting that she hoped to be at home by dinner to-day, and I ordered it accordingly. I am afraid my appearance will be very aukward in the company of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Seven years resi∣dence

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope it has improved her, or it will be seven years thrown away: but why should you be <HI>aukward,</HI> because <HI>she</HI> is <HI>accomplished?</HI> you have had the advantage of a good education, and under the eye of an amiable mother, whose acquirements and constant attention must have given you a benefit your cousin wanted, separated as she has been for such a length of time from all her relations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My aunt holds me so cheap for having been educated in England, though the forbears to speak her sentiments, I think her <HI>looks</HI> seem to say, when my mamma kindly commends my behaviour, <HI>"my daughter will soon con∣vince you whose judgment is the best."</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should avoid all suspicions of this kind: for it is un∣generous to judge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passes in the <HI>minds of others</HI> merely for their <HI>looks;</HI> had your mamma thought as you do, I dare say she would have been equally hurt, but would have forborn to express her chagrin to any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw yesterday morning tears start into her eyes, at a remark my aunt made on <HI>home education,</HI> but it is true, that instead of taking it up, she only turned and embraced me with the greatest affection, and seemed, whilst she pres∣sed me to her bosom, to say, <HI>"I am satisfied with you."</HI> My aunt was too full of her approaching meeting with <HI>Cecilia,</HI> to say even adieu to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The neglect was pardonable. I must not have you think of it. Your mamma's conduct through life will be an excellent guide for you. Be thankful to GOD that you have before your eyes such an example. She has sacrificed her own feelings on many occasions; and when I lost my son, consented, for my sake, to take your aunt and cousins into this house. You are old enough to re∣mark, that they are in some respects different from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

both in sentiment and character: yet to this she has sub∣mitted, and without once deviating from the respect which she thinks due to the relief of so near a relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, my cousin <HI>George</HI> often treats my mamma shamefully, and yet my aunt seldom reproves him for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is with great concern I see his mother's blind indul∣gence towards him; but as he has a <HI>good understanding,</HI> I hope he will in time learn to behave with propriety.</P>

<P>I will give you some paper, <HI>George,</HI> with as much plea∣sure, as seeing you pay duty and respect to your grand∣mamma would give me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to be rude to grandmamma, and will kiss her if the pleases; for, indeed, she is never cross to me; but I heard Miss <HI>Ward</HI> complain the other day, how ill-natured her grandmother was: and she said, she did not know what use old women were of, if they must <HI>live,</HI> but to sit in the chimney corner and knit stockings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you have adopted this sentiment, <HI>George,</HI> my affec∣tion can be of little estimation in your opinion; yet I feel myself your parent, and am truly anxious for your welfare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think Miss <HI>Ward</HI> was quite inexcuseable to use such expressions; for if she has no sense of duty, or propriety herself, she should not have endeavoured to pervert the minds of others.</P>

<P>It is what I have used constantly these <HI>three</HI> years, and shall continue to <HI>cut</HI> with it in spite of all <HI>she</HI> can say to the contrary; I am not quite <HI>vulgar</HI> enough to <HI>eat</HI> with one, as I suppose <HI>you</HI> all do.</P>

<P>There you are mistaken, Mrs. <HI>Frenchwoman;</HI> I often wish my aunt's eyes behind her, because she watches <HI>me</HI> so narrowly, for fear I should put any thing to my <HI>mouth</HI> with my knife; but then we are not <HI>absurd</HI> or <HI>dirty</HI> enough to use such a <HI>nasty thing</HI> as <HI>that.</HI></P>

<P>You distress me greatly, <HI>Cecilia,</HI> by thus misconstruing my intentions, [<HI>takes her hand with great affection.</HI>] I am sure proving myself sincerely your friend will afford hap∣piness to myself; and I hope, this house, once so dear to you, and which you regretted leaving when your mam∣ma sent you abroad, will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> highly estimated as ever.</P>

<P>I KNEW very well, sister, that you would not dare to pull out that <HI>nasty quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knife,</HI> before grandmamma, notwithstanding what you said.</P>
</SP>

<P>I think, sir, I had enough of your imper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence before dinner; I must claim my mamma's protection from any more of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a shame, <HI>George,</HI> that you should quarrel with your sister so soon after your meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you need not take <HI>her</HI> part; she wants no second, I assure you, mamma, she was quite a <HI>match</HI> for my cou∣sin and me together before dinner.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, <HI>Teresa,</HI> to hear that you have been dispu∣ting, and wonder from whose example you could learn it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear grandmamma, I have not <HI>deserved</HI> your censure on this occasion; <HI>George</HI> quite mistakes.</P>

<HI>truth,</HI> we had a fine <HI>battle of the tongues</HI> amongst us; but that is nothing <HI>new</HI> to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is very new in <HI>this house,</HI> and what we never ap∣prove. <HI>George,</HI> to be sure, sometimes thinking himself <HI>wiser</HI> than any of us, prefers giving his opinion to hear∣ing ours; however, we seldom spare him, for it is unpar∣donable, even in a rude unpolished school-boy, to behave in that manner, but in young ladies, it proves a want of delicacy and sentiment. Fie, <HI>Teresa!</HI> I thought you had too much gentleness to be guilty of such an error.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Miss</HI> Selwyn <HI>appears to be quite distressed, but continues silent,</HI>]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>We never passed a day in the convent without half a dozen quarrels amongst the boarders; by which mean I am so accustomed to them, that I could not live in <HI>quiet∣ness</HI> for the world. You look quite <HI>ashamed</HI> of it, cousin, why, I am not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the blessed effects of the <HI>foreign</HI> educa∣tion you have had; and your speech convinces me, that <HI>you</HI> alone were to blame; poor <HI>Teresa</HI> could not avoid be∣ing a <HI>spectator;</HI> but her distressed appearance plainly speaks she took no other part in the contention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I imagine, my cousin is to be supposed <HI>always</HI> in the <HI>right,</HI> because she was bred at home under your tuition, grandmamma, and according to your precepts. But con∣sider the change of fashions in the last sixty years, and how different young people are now to what they were formerly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is with great concern I observe the alteration you mention; but sixty years cannot make <HI>absurdity</HI> appear like <HI>reason,</HI> or <HI>pertness,</HI> like <HI>understanding.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, if I was <HI>demure, simple,</HI> and <HI>silent,</HI> you would
<PB N="69" REF="023336_0267_0FBEFBADC455B5F0"/>
call me <HI>modest,</HI> and <HI>well bred;</HI> but what use would it be to have <HI>accomplishments</HI> if I did not try to shew them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you then think, <HI>Cecilia,</HI> impertinent unmeaning remarks are proofs of knowledge? you take the method to convince us of the contrary: <HI>silence</HI> might hide your <HI>deficiency;</HI> there is no being mistaken when once you open your mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a little hard, that I may not speak of the customs which prevail among people with whom I have passed almost half my life; but I suppose I am prevented, for fear I should convince others that I know more than my <HI>listeners.</HI></P>

<P>Incorrigible girl! have you no affection? no feeling? no sense of duty?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in no hurry. You are not well, daughter, I fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mind, dear madam, is greatly disturbed. [<HI>She bursts into tears.</HI>] The consequence of my strange infa∣tuation have, I fear, quite changed the once gentle mind of my poor <HI>Cecilia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are convinced it wants <HI>correcting</HI> my fears abate; she is <HI>young,</HI> and may yet be taught to overcome the pre∣judices of education, difficult as I fear the task may prove; but I own, I apprehended you would be as <HI>blind</HI> to her <HI>errors</HI> as you were to her <HI>interest,</HI> when you determined on giving her a foreign education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know not, my dear mother, the misery that I now experience, for having obstinately persevered in an opin∣ion so fatal to my child. O! that I alone suffered! un∣happy girl! my fatal impropriety has perverted her heart, and deprived her of those finer feelings, which are the greatest ornaments of the female mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Comfort yourself dear <HI>Louisa,</HI> your daughter is not old in error; the very acquisitions she so much plumes herself upon, will only turn to her mortification. Intro∣duce her among amiable people; their example will shew her the absurdity of her own conceit, and teach her how trifling outward accomplishments are, when unaccompa∣nied by diffidence and modesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="81" REF="023336_0279_0FBEFBC98B8FD2D8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor will it be amiss to let her sometimes mix with young people as improperly educated as herself. The contrast will be striking, and more convincing than pre∣cept; she must be led by gentleness, by attentively watch∣ing every turn of her mind, we may imperceptibly im∣plant that solid virtue we wish to <HI>cultivate.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ought not to <HI>despair</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have such kind and able assistants; but I do not deserve, after my miserable mis∣management, the happiness of seeing my daughter like her cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Subject as we all are to errors, it is our duty to excuse them. Parents who love their children, certainly wish to fix on the properest mode of education, and such as they think will lead them to the good they wish them to gain. But here the parent's mind betrays the child, and the worldly minded cannot expect such blessed effects as generally reward those who have a view to higher con∣siderations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I, madam, had better advisers, and might have es∣caped the rock so plainly pointed out to <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were young, and perhaps thought an old woman's advice the effect of age and spleen; but tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> past. Let us now endeavour to <HI>overcome</HI> what we could not <HI>prevent.</HI> You, <HI>Louisa,</HI> must be the great actor: your daughter will not regard the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>monitions of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and me, unless they are supported <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you. The first thing, therefore, you have to determine on, is <HI>steadiness;</HI> upon no account be led to <HI>smile,</HI> or encourage any of her <HI>live∣ly sallies,</HI> (as she terms them,) which at best are only <HI>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ness</HI> and <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppancy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sister, who is so different herself, will not, I think, allow in <HI>Cecilia</HI> such wretched meanness, by some called, <HI>wit,</HI> which consists in ridiculing the worthy; some, be∣cause they are old; others, because they are <HI>grave;</HI> and
<PB N="82" REF="023336_0280_0FBEFBCAF24ABD98"/>
others, because they are <HI>ugly;</HI> to such persons, an <HI>old face, a large nose, a wide mouth, little eyes,</HI> &amp;c. will fur∣nish subjects for mirth during a whole afternoon, to those who do not consider the <HI>wickedness</HI> of remarks which re∣flect on the divine hand that formed persons with these imperfections, not on the unfortunate possessors of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> I detest such kind of conversation as much as you can do; for it is totally inconsistent with that commendable sensibility which ought to make a part of the female character. Persons who have a turn to this kind of ridicule, must either be insensibly thoughtless or else cruel and malicious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>less,</HI> in my opinion, is detestable. How often have I seen <HI>low ridicule</HI> put the <HI>worthy</HI> and the <HI>diffident</HI> out of countenance, while many stood smiling round, en∣joying the jest, and the confusion it produced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon those occasions frequently have I prayed, that my children might escape such unworthy sentiments; and now, by my mode of education, they seem to be the cha∣racteristic of them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not alarmed on <HI>George'</HI>s account; he has a great deal of <HI>good sense</HI> under the roughness of a school-boy; and I think, the scene that passed this afternoon, which Miss <HI>Franklin</HI> really described in a very diverting manner, will be a mean of shewing <HI>Cecilia,</HI> the absurdity of her conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; while he ridiculed his sister's folly, he shewed a distinguishing mind, for he did not attempt ri∣diculing any of the other young ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely he ought not to be encouraged in treating <HI>Cecilia</HI> with contempt, and making her the subject of mirth to <HI>himself</HI> and <HI>friends.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P><PB N="83" REF="023336_0281_0FBEFBCC9D5B6950"/>
Undoubtedly not; we must endeavour to convince him of this impropriety and teach him to correct it; but yet, his behaviour may be made a useful lesson to his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish she may be prevailed on to receive it as such.—But alas! she seems very little disposed to avail herself of any mode of instruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hope the best my dear sister. The follies we have this day observed in <HI>Cecilia,</HI> shew a <HI>perverted under∣standing,</HI> it must be owned, but do not prove that she has a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad heart.</HI> I wish much to know whether she has es∣caped perversion in a very material point—I mean <HI>Reli∣gion.</HI>—The danger in this respect, has all along appeared to me so great, that I could never think of it without hor∣ror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a subject we must at least for a time avoid talking upon to her, though of infinitely the greatest consequence; our own attention will soon enable us to make every re∣quisue observation, and instruct us in the best methods to pursue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shudder to reflect on what a precipice my belov∣ed <HI>Cecilia</HI> stands. O, that my prayers may avail to avert this most poignant misfortune! I must enter upon the subject as soon as possible, for I am all anxiety to know <HI>what my child is.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Keep up your spirits, however my dear sister; you must have all your thoughts about you, and endeavour to take the lead in every conversation at which <HI>Cecilia</HI> is present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will certainly follow your advice, and study to re∣trieve my past errors. Wonderful! that I should per∣sist for seven years in one which deprived me of my greatest joy and comfort; for never mother loved a child more than I do my <HI>Cecilia;</HI> and, but for what I thought her advantage, she should never have been out of my sight. Often have I envied <HI>you,</HI> sister, in having <HI>Tere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="023336_0282_0FBEFBCE6B7609A0"/>
with you, and should certainly have sent for my daughter, but that a <HI>false shame</HI> restrained me from it; though I always <HI>dreaded,</HI> as much as <HI>longed,</HI> for her teturn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, daughter, the expence of education abroad is nearly as much as at home; and if so, what reason can there be for banishing a child so many years?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, <HI>Cecilia's</HI> education has cost me even more than it would have done in <HI>England.</HI> The first year the demands for it were moderate, and according to the agreement I made; but they have increased since more that I wish to own; for this confession only adds to the inexcufeableness of my conduct. The superior of the convent, solemnly engaged to leave her free in res∣pect to religion; but disappointed as I am in other res∣pects, I can have little hopes that her mind remains un∣tainted in this particular.</P>

<P>It is in vain to reason with you, sir; but you shall go to school to-morrow, and never come home till you have learnt to behave with more propriety. Your sister's foi∣bles, however great, ought not to be subjects for <HI>ridicule,</HI> but <HI>pity,</HI> to her nearest relations.</P>

<P>Whatever I have said, aunt, was only in <HI>jest.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well it was the same with me. I meant no harm, on∣ly a little diversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have both been extremely to blame; and your punishment, <HI>Cecilia,</HI> though inflicted by a wrong person, is such as may shew you the impropriety of that low mean opinion, which leads you, when in the ridiculing vein, to spare neither friend nor relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very hard, mamma, that I must not speak a word, but my brother will repeat it to my disadvantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say nothing improper, and you need not fear a repe∣tition of it. Do by others as you would have them do by you, and you will no longer be guilty of a fault that must tender your company unpleasant to every one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>La! mamma, one cannot be expected <HI>to think</HI> at <HI>my age</HI> as <HI>you</HI> do. I often speak without any meaning at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And by that mean <HI>wound</HI> where you should be <HI>kind.</HI> The tricks your brother has played you <HI>he</HI> did <HI>unthinking∣ly; yet you do not accept that excuse from him as a com∣pensation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly, because he <HI>hurt</HI> me, and made me ap∣pear <HI>absurd,</HI> before <HI>company.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet you can with pleasure, by flippancy, put the <HI>modest</HI> out of countenance, merely because they are without the same talents to retort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never <HI>thought</HI> about it before, nor was I ever correc∣ted upon the subject, but was always encouraged by my companions to make them laugh.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have more excuse than any of these young ladies could have for the same sault, because you have been de∣prived of good advisers; but I hope to convince you, how very disagreeable such kind of low wit must render you.</P>
<P>[<HI>Miss</HI> Ward <HI>appears confused.</HI>]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will allow grandmamma, that the natural fiveliness of young people may sometimes lead them to <HI>say</HI> and <HI>do</HI> things they ought not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make every allowance for the inexperience and vola∣tility of youth; but when a fault proceeds from an <HI>un∣feeling heart,</HI> it is, in my eyes, unpardonable; and I have no idea that a person of a good disposition can, <HI>at any age,</HI> take pleasure in putting another out of countenance, merely for thinking they have said a good thing.

<P>I am very happy to be employed; and what is more, I am sorry for my behaviour to my sister, and will never act so again to any one. I had no design to be ill-natured, though it appeared that I had. [<HI>He goes to her, and takes her hand very affectionately.</HI>] Come <HI>Cecilia,</HI> you must forgive me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most cordially, <HI>George,</HI> and I thank you for your ex∣cuses. I am quite ashamed of my own conduct, which drew upon me your censure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Cecilia,</HI> without a <HI>jest,</HI> you do not appear half so well as these other young ladles. I should not find fault with you if you were like them.</P>

<P>Well, sir, you need not begin again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON, [interrupting her.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I must take my son's part. He has indeed given you most excellent advice. Your <HI>spirits</HI> appear <HI>assumed</HI> and not <HI>natural.</HI> Some young people are livelier than others; and, when it is the bent of their dispositions, their liveliness is very pleasing; but you <HI>Cecilia,</HI> when a child were always <HI>grave;</HI> your present mode of conduct does not, therefore, sit easy upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON. [after a pause.]</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear mamma, I will confess my inward mind to you. I was so unhappy in the convent, that had I not assumed this frivolous manner of behaviour I should have fretted myself to death. You were too distant to hear my complaints. I was not permitted to write to you. Ha∣bit familiarised nonsense; and I thought it right on my return to appear as I had done abroad, that I might be un∣like every one bred in <HI>England.</HI> I shall endeavour to resume my natural temper, though your instruction will be necessary to remind me when I forget myself.</P>

<P>Come, and let me embrace my beloved child, the dear offspring of an excellent son. Your last speech has given me a joy I little expected to feel from your late appearance. [<HI>They embrace and shed tears.</HI>]</P>

<P>That I will, my dear <HI>Teresa,</HI> and with joy accept your kind invitation; though I own, with blushes, the hope of <HI>out-doing you,</HI> made me purchase that false hair which produced my shame, and now my happiness.</P>

<P>Do not blame yourself, or your education too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dear Miss <HI>Vernon,</HI> since you are kindly pardoned.

<SPEAKER>Mrs. SELWYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent resolution my dear, and I doubt not your keeping it.

<P>You are very polite young ladies, with such a disposi∣tion your society will be desirable to people of all ages. But there is time for all things.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how did you like it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was pleased with the solemnity of their worship; and still I must confess, my dear mamma, that I rather feel a bias towards a religion which, notwithstanding the promises that were made to you to the contrary, those who had the care of my education took so much pains to inculcate; and had it not been for the urgent desire I felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o return to <HI>England,</HI> I certainly should have profes∣sed myself a Roman Catholic; but I knew I should by this mean cut myself off from my family and dearest con∣nections, therefore, resolved to resist all importunities; and the levity of conduct which I assumed, (though high∣ly blameable) was thus far serviceable to me, that it selt me little time to attend to any serious subject; for, except during the time of divine service, and whilst I was re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iving grave lectures, I seldom thought on religion at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a fortunate escape have you had. Oh, how my heart reproaches me for the danger I have exposed you to!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not, my dear daughter, afflict yourself too much for an error, which, I trust, is not irreparable. I hope, from the comparison which <HI>Cecilia,</HI> now she is of an age to distinguish, will be able to make between our <HI>rational</HI> ser∣vice and the unmeaning pageantry of the Romish Church, she will easily incline to give preference to the former; and that we shall be able to eradicate the false prejudices she has unhappily imbibed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss VERNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear grandmamma, I will with pleasure attend to the instructions of you and the rest of my good friends.—I am very ignorant, but I yield myself to your guidance.</P>
