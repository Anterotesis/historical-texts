<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I LIVED at Wyoming on the Susquehannah river at the time when it was cut off by the Indians, and with my family was captivated with many others, on condition of being subject to the king and had liberty to live on our farms, the articles of capitulation were made and signed July 5, 1778, and none of our effects to be destroyed; but they soon broke the agreement by burning buildings, killing and driving off our cat∣tle, sheep, horses and hogs, and plundering every thing they could find, but as I had hid some of our houshold stuff so that they could not find it, and out of ten head of cattle when we went from the fort to our house (as it was not burnt) we found some of our cat∣tle, viz. one ox, one milch cow, and four young cat∣tle, so concluded we would try to live there and not leave the country, and so picked up the small matter the Indians had left us, and went to keeping house although very near naked, yet naked as we were we took courage and went to work at harvesting and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing, but about ten days after as we were about our business, two or three Indians came and told us that the Indians were returning with some wild Indians that had not been with them in the battle nor plundering, and if we were not all gone in the space of two hours we should all be scalped.

to drink, when we set off from there my Indian master went along a little before me and I being lame went very slowly till all of a sudden I felt a blow on my head which sallied me out of the path, I recovered a little and he struck me on the other side of my head, which nearly brought me to the ground, I looked and saw it was an Indian that followed me from the tory camp, I did my best to get out of his way, but he fol∣lowed me sometime with kicks and blows till at last he went back to his camp, and my master stopped till I came up and then made me go before him, so went on, came to Shemongo quite late in the evening and very dark, my master gave the prisoner hoop which rallied the whole town, numbers of them met us yelling and screaming, jumping and running, the Indian Cap∣tain took hold of my hand run with me some distance into a house, so they did not hurt me, but they took Blanchard and very much abused him, but after some∣time he came where I was, being wounded on the head and face, was very bloody, the Captain appeared piti∣ful, gave him water to wash his bloody face and head, here we lay that night not bound at all, next day my companion took his leave of me, he said I shall never see you again, pray for me, it is all we can do for each other, so I went on; two Indians went with me to con∣duct me, we had not gone far before we came to some Indians, one exceeding fierce in warlike appearance, came up to me and with great fury began to strip off my clothes even my shirt, and I went on naked about twenty rods; another Indian came briskly to me said yankee, yankee, he having a drawn sword in his hand fetched it up as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f he was going to cut me in two, but struck with it flat on my back, went a little further came to a town of them, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> came out and placed

themselves in two ranks one each side of the path, as near as I can guess about fifteen in each rank, each having a stick in his hand, my conductors went on be∣fore me between the two ranks, I followed after slowly, they all made some attempts to strike me, but they did not hurt me much, we went on and came to the French Catherines, a squaw so called, this old squaw could speak good English and told what they was go∣ing to do with me, and the next day sent two Indians to carry me on horseback towards Appletown, in In∣dian called Condawhaw, and left me at a house called the Longhouse, where I stayed three days, then came an old Indian and carried me home with him to Ap∣pletown, to the old squaw to whom I was given as a grandson, she made great lamentation over me shewing many signs of respect to me, and so did three little squaws the same. A few days after came an Indian scout to this town, with two captives that they took on the Susquehannah river, I went to speak with the captives, but they would not let them speak much with me, the next morning the Captain of the scout came to me, asked me if I knew his prisoners, I told him no; he told me how I was disposed of and how they called their relations in their way, told me this old squaw is your grandmother, and pointing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig∣est of the little ones said that is your sister, and them two little ones are your cousins, and so went on through the town telling me who were my relations, and said I should soon be an Indian and then I should know all about it, I was glad of this opportunity for I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heard any English words for many days before.

Some time in June, 1779, I became a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quainted with an Indian that could speak good English▪ I went with him to a salt spring to make salt, and I had a brass kettle that held about one pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l full, I fill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it with the water of the spring and boiled it down to salt, as near as I could judge it made one quart; while we were on this voyage we eat one bull and helped eat several horses, yet I remained very weak, having been so long with∣out proper food it was ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y hard for me to travail four miles in a day, for when I had done making salt I made an attempt to run away, but found myself not able, as I had tried it once before and found myself unable. Soon after I got back from making salt I heard of the army a coming, I made it all my study to get to them, finally I took this method, the Indians gathered all the force they could to withstand our army, but being defeated and driven before our army come where I was, told us we must all go to Niagara and I set out with the Indians and went one day's journey with them, at night we encamped in the woods, I judge there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>60 Indians and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>12 tories and British soldiers, I waited until about the middle of the night, all were still and I thought asleep, so I took what I had prepared to carry and set out and crept off till I had got beyond all their guards, and then travailed as fast as I could all the rest of the night, much of the way the weeds and brush were as high as my head and very thick so went but slow, about break of day I lay down and slept till near sunrise and got up and about three in the afternoon came near Appletown, where I went from the day before, hearing bells in the town laid down

my pack in a swamp and resolved to see who was in the town, thinking it might be our army and so crawled along till I was very near, I rose up to look and to my great surprise a few rods one side of me an Indian spoke to me in the Seneka language, said come here, I answered him in Indian; <HI>and to no,</HI> and made off, but he followed me and insisted that I would come to him; I asked him who was in the town; he said In∣dians, I went directly to him and went with him into the town, where I was surrounded and taken by about 100 of them, shook hands with them, they said you have run away, I asked them how that could be, point∣ed and told them that was my grandmother's house, they said why you walk bushes then, and where is your grandmother?

But to re∣turn, I was talking with old acquaintance, Gene∣ral Poor sent for me to come into his marker, where I eat wheat bread, and pork, and beef, such victuals I had not eat nor tasted above twelve months; Gene∣ral S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llivan sent for me, and examined me who I was, and where from, and how I came there, I told him the whole of the affair. There was many gentlemen of∣ficers that could testify to my faithfulness, yet I was ordered under provost, and so used as a prisoner; I went with them to assist as a guide where I was ac∣quainted, and went with the army as far as they went and returned with them to Wyoming, from whence I was first taken; many of my old acquaintance came to me to congratulate my return, and made me several

presents; I stayed here some days; a horse being pre∣sented to me to ride to find my family, I set out, found them at Kent in Connecticut, where we had formerly lived before we went to the Susquehannah, on or about the 25th day of October, 1779, to my great joy, having not seen them in the space of about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourteen months and a half—my old neighbours and acquaint∣ance gave many tokens of their respect and rejoiced with us.</P>
<P>Perhaps it would not be amiss to speak word or two as to the exercise of my mind whilst in this scene of trial.</P>
<P>August 25, 1779. O memorable day! when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> savages naked and dismally painted with red and black, rose up within reach of me, my first thought was to run, but thinking if I did run they would cer∣tainly kill me, and if I stood they could but kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and death appeared near then; with ejaculations earnestly desired that I might have wisdom to direct me in this moment of tryal, and grant to me all the needed graces of his spirit, and grant me deliverance from the fear of men and particularly from these In∣dians which could only kill the body; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they behaved as though they would kill me every mo∣ment, yet I think I retained my best judgment and did as well and as fight for my own safety as I have ever thought of since; I had some sense that I was in the hand of the same God that made me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, and he could dispose them to shew me favour, and daily and almost hourly sent up ejaculatory pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers to to almighty God, that I may constantly feel my de∣pendance upon him and put my trust in him. When the Indian my master made daily and hourly attempts to fire me through, sometimes his gun at my head and sometimes at my breast; I often said in myself you

can't kill me without a commission from the God in whose hand my breath is, and if this is the way God had appointed for me to die, it was my duty to sub∣mit to his will, and blessed be God that I had any de∣gree of submission as I thought sometimes I really had. When we came to Shemongo, the Indians were so wild and fierce, I thought that I and my fellow prisoners should certainly be slain; now death was a terror to me, but I think I did in some measure take sanctuary in God; sometimes it troubled me to think of being killed or dying in a heathen land, but one time I re∣member in particular, it seemed to me I were as wil∣ling to die now and in this place as I ever should be at any future time or any other place; it was my earnest desire to know my duty in all respects, and to be rightly disposed to all beings. When I come to the log-house where I lived three days, my first busi∣ness was to find a place of convenient retirement, and by the side of the lake under a high clift of rocks, spent much of the three days; so when I come to Ap∣pletown, spent much of my time along the woods, I had no book of any kind, endeavouring to spend the first Wednesday in every month in private fasting, prayer and meditation when my health and the wea∣ther would admit. Some time in November, one Michael Showers gave me a bible, which was a great comfort to me, I hope I had a disposition of thank∣fulness, for that as I thought then, as it really is the most blessed book in this world, I took great sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣faction in reading David's psalms; when wintry days and snow and cold came on, as I was in Indian dress, a cold fashioned dress to me, I feared I should have no convenient place to retire on account of the wea∣ther, but as I was looking one day, found a cave in the side of a hill where I could be hid from mortal

eyes, and also from the inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ncy of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where I retired twice at least every day, and spent the most part of the sabbaths there, meditating and read∣ing the bible; it was with much hard suffering thus I lived through the winter; the next summer Partial Terry sent me a book called Mr. Edwards's life. When I thought of running away from the In∣dians, as I made several trials, I was very solicitous as know my duty, that I might not through self love throw away my life foolishly; on the whole conclud∣ed it was my duty, if I could with safety and when I had clean escaped the guards, to fall on my knees and return thanks, and to ask for future preservation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And when the riflemen came to me and so barbarously treated me, I almost gave over all hopes of life, had but little hope if any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all left; and notwithstanding for many times expected, now is my last mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of life, yet I never asked any creature to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before then, but while in their cruel hands I had not much time for contemplation; and when I came to the army it was a matter of joy to me, and reason de∣manded a thankful heart, but seems to me my mind was all confused, yet I think I longed to be alone out of the noise of the army, and found my confine∣ment was a great trial to me.</P>
<P>Now to give a brief account of the manners of the Indians. Those which I lived with did not appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have any principles of religion at all, though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have some idea of an invisible Being, I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> find wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Being they thought it was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together often, and have one to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the auditory; some minutes one time after a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ech to the auditory, they hung a dog on a high pole, and burnt another under it, one Indian told me that was to have good luck against the Yankees;
