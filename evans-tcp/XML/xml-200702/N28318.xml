<P>THE AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST VOLUME.</P>
<P>ON this collection of my theatrical productions, I have little to say. As they had the good fortune of meeting with the public's approbation, they will un∣doubtedly displease the reviewers. I am so well ac∣customed to the asperity of those censors against pub∣lic approbation; to their illiberal hints against the morality of my pieces; to their evident endeavours to attack the weaker parts, and still more to discolour the good, that I shall not lose a single word on that subject.</P>
<P>I know better than any reviewer that I do not pro∣duce master pieces, and that, as a dramatic writer, I deserve but a subordinate rank. My productions are chiefly calculated for stage effect; they obtain that end, and in this point of view they ought to be judged. The public, which, for years back, has done me justice, will, I trust, furnish me in future with oil against the bitings of these musquetoes.</P>
<P>Some have objected to the <HI>Count of Burgundy,</HI> as appearing in the third act suddenly too accomplished. But has not that rather been the fault of the actor, who was unable to penetrate deep enough into the author's meaning?—If the young Count brings it forth as declamation what he has to say in the third act, to the people, to his mother, &amp;c. &amp;c.; if he rai∣ses his sentiments into sentences by ostentation in his
<PB N="iv" REF="037746_0003_100ED4826FC93B08"/>
expression; if he does not speak it carelessly, just so as his feeling lays it upon his tongue; if he permits himself but one moment, in accent and manners, to play the hero; then indeed the audience must find a striking difference between him and the child of na∣ture in the two first acts. I am sorry to learn, that most of the young actors perform the Count's part in that manner, but that is not my fault. It was my duty not to insert any thing in the third act that might be contradictory to the words of the first and second, and this duty, I trust, I have fulfilled. If they are spoken, as I thought them to myself; the audience will recognize the hermit's son in the reigning Count.</P>
<P><HI>False Shame</HI> is a subject, which, I believe, has for the first time been brought upon the stage; and this fault being the source of so many evils in this world, I hope to have acquired some merit by inspiring ma∣ny a good heart with <HI>confidence</HI> to <HI>confidence.</HI></P>
<P>The idea of <HI>La Peyrouse,</HI> suddenly rose within me, when, some time ago, I read in the public prints that the wise of this unfortunate man, had embarked, in search of him on uninhabited coasts. My imagina∣tion followed her to sea, created interesting situa∣tions, and lost itself in the empire of possibilities. But that in the plan of this piece—in <HI>s</HI>pite of the most careful evasion of every thing improper—an error against morality should have been found, is a delica∣cy, to which I was not prepared.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Wild Youth</HI>—it is but a Christmas a∣musement, and is not to represent any thing else.</P>

<HEAD>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>To lay before the public a faithful translation of all the dramatic productions of the celebrated Kotze∣bue, who is justly styled the GERMAN SHAKESPEAR, is the design of the present undertaking.</P>
<P>The difficulty of translating from the German into the English language is very considerable, as has been sufficiently verified by the many unsuccessful attempts which have been made for that purpose.</P>
<P>But if there is, in general, a difficulty in translating from so copious a language as the German, it must obviously be considerably encreased when we at∣tempt dramatic writings, in which in order to do jus∣tice to the original it is essentially necessary, that we should be well acquainted with the very genius and spirit of that language.</P>
<P>To represent the meaning of KOTZEBUE precisely as he intended it, shall be the main aim throughout this publication; and if in accomplishing so impor∣tant an object the language should in some instances be found rather deficient in point of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I doubt not of obtaining a ready excuse from a can∣did public.</P>
<P>To the intelligent reader, whether he be in the ha∣bit of seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, it is of no moment what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the per∣formance: but when <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his down to peruse the author, he will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="vi" REF="037746_0005_100EFE0D6E6F7F38"/>
every effusion of his heart in its real purity. He wishes neither for curtailment nor alterations—much less for any additions, which being often the produc∣tions of men of inferior talents, greatly diminish the splendor of the original author.</P>

<P>When you sing <HI>Hora</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An hourly exercise of devotion is convents,</NOTE>, you are cast down. But when you sing the battle song of Murgarten or the Victory song of Sempach, then your cheeks glow and your eyes burn like the wax candle before the holy virgin.</P>

<P>Sweet fruits, for those who can wait.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why have you kindled within me a flame, that finds no nourishment in these forests and, consumes me?—Why telling me so much of battles and fights that man and horse day and night parade before my eyes? as often as our old stallion neighs in the stable, I look for a lance and touch a rosary. As often as the guard on the Castle's steeple sounds the horn, I run for a sword and lay hold of an ax. Each great action makes the blood flow to my heart and brings water in my eyes. Every valiant knight I would press to my heart, and split the head of every scoundrel with the battle ax.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such I wanted you to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what? for whom?—Have you taught me so many sciences, to sing them before our shep∣herds at their festivals? Whoever brings up a falcon for the chase must not confine him in a cage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>strength belongs to youth. Even in this wil∣low branch is juice and strength, but it is pliable. Obe∣dience ornaments the boy.</P>

<P>Is the bow to become slack, wet it; give me herbs to cool my blood.</P>

<P>Go, try your courage with bears and wolves.</P>

<P>They are but trifling robbers as long as men exist. Let me go to the castle. Knight Cuno long since wished me to become his armour bearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you leave your old father alone in this wilderness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a pious man, the whole vicinity re∣veres the pious brother Peter,—who would hurt you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough, Henry it is not becoming you to be Cuno's armour bearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the race of Hallwyll noble and re∣nowned?—and who am I then, that I should be asha∣med to learn of Cuno to bear arms?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dive not into matters, which time only un∣folds. A youth may bear arms but not keep a secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Father, why humble me? Is a noble name my inheritance, why will you withhold the treasure from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deliver it now into your hands, would be depriving you of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>A problem—always problems! why has the father so little confidence in his son?—have you fled from the field of honour into a desart; have you con∣verted your armour into a hermit's habit; and why—has power forced you to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, suppose you have hit the point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me a sword, I will avenge you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, son, revenge slowly follows vice and has wings only to attain virtue. The wished for hour is not yet come.</P>

<P>Allow me at least to travel into foreign countries, to prepare myself by actions for your re∣venge.</P>

<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would'st soon forget in the tumult of the world your old father and his wilderness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not in earnest. I love you and the wilderness where I grew up; I love the apple-tree, which you have planted on my second birth day; and the grave upon which you used to weep; I love the wood stream, our summer bath, and the little garden, where the plants grow under my hands. Above all, I love Miss Elsbeth, who was shooting at my side like a young <HI>cedar,</HI> and whose cheeks glow like the castle windows when the evening sun gilds them. Also do I <HI>love</HI> old <HI>Cuno,</HI> because Elsbeth calls him father. Not to forget mother Gertraud! often have I plagued her in return for her nice cakes. Yes, I love all, all.—The road into the world is the road to honor; that in∣to the mountains the small path to tranquility. Suffer only one twig of laurels to bloom round my head. Af∣ter that I am with you and lay myself to Elsbeths feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Water your plants, and if you grow too warm, cool yourself in the wood stream, till the time-piece, calls you to higher actions—who knows how soon?—a short while yet—perhaps fortune favors you before the leaves fall off these trees. My basket is finished. You forgot by your prattling your days work. There in the garden is work enough. Split your wood and then come to assist me.</P>

<P>Listening? Good Bruno, you come from a princely court. Here in this wilderness we listen to nightingales only. Henry is far enough. I have sent him to the lake to catch a mess of fish—I was fearful lest his questions would disturb the sensation which, at this work, I wish to nourish—Enough! Do you see the trunk? Let us go and lift it up, it is not heavy. <STAGE>(They descend into the hole and lift up the box)</STAGE> hah! how la∣bour and frugality add to the strength, which is absorbed by age. Indeed, Bruno, eighteen years ago I lifted this trunk with less ease than to day.—There it is—I see it again, and think of the last look I gave it on covering it with earth—my wife was then at my side—at this tree she was leaning—the tree is green yet—Oh!— <STAGE>(<HI>he endeavors to collect himself</HI>)</STAGE> here is the key—cov∣ered with rust—we shall open the lock easier with the hatchet. <STAGE>(<HI>After some efforts the lid opens.

<P>Twenty years have elapsed since, and you recol∣lect it still with grateful tears.

Enough, Bruno, our country calls—be silent, my heart!—See here the swathing clothes in which Henry lay, when he in Agnez's arms escaped the bloody scene.—This here is the ring with the seal of the old Count—This the cup with the arms of Burgundy, which many a foreign prince took from my hands to take a welcome draught—Here underneath my armour, with helmet and sword—Let us see whether I can handle it yet— <STAGE>(he draws the sword, swing∣ing it over his head)</STAGE>—For God and my country!

<SPEAKER>Bened.</SPEAKER>
<P>On his bed he died, it's true, but quiet? <STAGE>(<HI>he shakes his head.</HI>)</STAGE> He could not even dose quietly. A prince who goes to bed without a good action, goes without consolation to his grave. At the first knock of my hammer in the morning, suddenly there came a guard from the palace: Mr. Benedict, the Count orders you to leave off hammering! it disturbs his morning slumber. H'm!

<P>Indeed he was! always friendly and good. Here he often would stop to look at my work, and when the sun was burning, he would never suffer me to take off my hat. Many a time he drank out of my silver cup.—I still see him passing by here, his little sons hopping round him. Oh! the dear little ones! they would take off their caps before every mechanic—nod to every fruit woman—and if they met a beggar, how quick they would put their little hands in their pockets, and filled, with silver pieces, hold them to the poor.—Oh! It goes to my very heart, when I think, how unmercifully they all were sent to the grave!</P>

<P>I was some days journey in the country about business. On my return, in a village a league from here night overtook me, and after having sent on my cattle, I laid down with other strangers upon the straw. It was dark. But when day light appeared, I awoke, and cast a glance upon the sleeping Strangers. An old man in Pilgrim's habit lay at my side. His cloth had been disordered. I saw an armour under his habit, which excited my curiosity. I looked at him attentively, and perceived on his finger a ring with a seal, exactly resem∣bling the ring of our murdered Count, which I often heard described, when it was missing.</P>

He roused them and they took their way towards the city. I kept them company, not to loose sight of them. On the way the old man asked me many questions; whether the people still loved the memory of their good old Count Albrecht? whether they hated his murderers? and some such things. He also spoke of you, Governor, and seemed to rejoice when he learnt that you were still living and in good health. At our arrival at the gates, I called the guards. We found in their travelling bag among other suspicious things, Swathing clothes, mark∣ed with the Burgundian arms, and the letter <HI>H,</HI> under a Lordly Crown.

<P>Overcome your surprise! hear me! hear a friend's voice. In that dreadful night, when the clash∣ing of the swords of hired murderers, and the groans of the dying surrounded me; when my good master al∣ready lay bleeding at my feet, and his elder sons were drawing their last breath; I called my wife, to whose care the youngest child was entrusted: Agnez, I cried, save your precious nursling! the Count's ring I took from the finger of the corpse, the silver cup I snatched from the table. By a secret door we escaped and reached the open air. In the darkness of the night, through swamps and bushes, through thorns and thistles, we walked on unused roads. The sun rose but to perplex us, for he gave light to our pursuers. During day we hid ourselves in cornfields, and silenced our hunger with unripe corn, God guarded your prince! we reached the frontiers of Burgundy. Thence I sent my old companion, my faith∣ful servant Bruno, back. He was to wait in silence, till he could bring me news of better times. At the foot of the Alps, in a poor hermit's hut, I took care of the dear pledge, confided to me by God. The boy has ri∣pened to youthful beauty. Citizens of Arles! to day I brought him back to you! take him, and your future hap∣piness from my hands!</P>

For∣merly she laughed at every thing; now she weeps for no∣thing. But patience, she will laugh enough, when she sees this fine knight. He is grown thick and sat; a dark complexion, black wiskers, a fine dress, and feathers in his hat. All is alive below in the castle yard; there are pages and chamber maids, horses and mules, chests and trunks without number. Ah! what fine things and bridal ornaments must they contain. My mouth water at the

If an arm is too weak to throw it around a neck, they care but little whe∣ther it has been lamed by the cut of a Saracene—Wal∣ter!

<P>That's well, Elsbeth. How do you like him.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, dear girl! I am as much rejoiced as if I had to go to my own wedding.</P>

<P>How mean you that?—I guess—you intend at your own castle?—I shall not suffer that! I am not rich, but to my Elsbeth's day of honor I give my last ounce of silver.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not say just now that all was settled?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Walt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we shan't marry, is settled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>That she without bashfulness—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Walt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has told me, that she could not love me.</P>

<P>Do not be angry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>Naughty child! will there be every day such suitors? you are a poor girl, your smooth face is but a slender dowry. You also know that I cannot, lead you, dressed in silk and velvet, from one carousal to another, there to be stared and eyed at. You bloom here in ob∣scurity; no one sees you, no one knows you; the num∣ber of my friends is but small, for at my house there are
<PB N="63" REF="037746_0069_100EFE94AA5C19D8"/>
no festivals. You ought to thank your patron saint for having sent to you un upright man, who does not despise our poverty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Walt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No persuasion, knight. I love to see the hops voluntarily encircle the elm; but I do not like to see them tied to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! Pooh! a little constraint, and it soon be∣comes natural.—Elsbeth! prepare yourself: On <HI>All Saint's Day</HI> your wedding with this worthy man, will take place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elsb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Father, I cannot! Let me retire into a convent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into a convent? Are you serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elsb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, father, the sooner! the better! there I'll pray for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will your prayers avail me? Those who do not act piously, pray.—I am old and weak, have no other support, and no other pleasure, but you—and me you will desert?—As I stood weeping at your mother's death bed; and with groans exclaimed: <HI>Who will now nurse me in my old age!</HI> the angel once more opened her eyes, smilingly pointed to you—and expi∣red.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elsb.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>Falls weeping upon his neck.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>Ah! my father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>I trusted to the promise of a dying wife. With consolation, I saw you grow up. Feeling my strength decline, I always said within myself, she will nurse me, <HI>she and my grand children;</HI> when attacked by the <HI>gout</HI> or <HI>lamed by the rheumatism,</HI> and unable to <HI>lift the spoon to my mouth, then she will feed me, she and my grand children.</HI></P>

<P>Father! dear fa∣ther!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>When, on account of my fidelity to my liege Lord, the Count of Greyerz, the Emperor proscribed me; when the finest of my castles became destroyed and de∣molished, and I saw my property go to ruin; then I thought: If God pleases, my Elsbeth will be spared to me! and if she finds a good and rich husband, I will live with her, she will not let me suffer in my old age.—Alas! poor old man! she goes to a convent and prays, to the saints to help her father, whom she does not like to assist

<STAGE>(Agitated.)</STAGE>
<P>Father! you weep? <STAGE>(<HI>Turning hastily to Walter.</HI>)</STAGE> Knight, I'll be your wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Walt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ought not to take advantage of this emotion; yet the sensibility, that leads you to my arms, is so pious and noble, that I draw from it sweet hopes for my future happiness. If such the daughter—how precious must be the wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>Embracing her.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>She is <HI>my daughter!</HI>—A mother's blessing and a father's thanks will accompany her to her new abode. When God intends to reward good children, he makes them benefactors to their parents!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Elsb.</SPEAKER>
<P>May your tears and the last smile of my mother always be before my eyes.</P>

<P>May I offer this ring to my graceful bride.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incomprehensible. Let down the drawbridge; assist him to dismount, and conduct him here. <HI>(Exit attendant.)</HI> They do not speak well of the Count of Burgundy. Is it not the same that killed his brother Al∣brecht?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Walt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is said, that he is dead.</P>

<P>It's all the same. Also with his son I'll have no concern.</P>
</SP>

<P>To the same. Count Henry, my master, de∣sires no other dowry than your daughter's heart.</P>

<P>Strange! by God! very strange! How can your Count have desire for a damsel, he never saw?</P>

<P>She is not strange to him, he often saw her.</P>

<P>You perplex me. Knight Blonay, you often gained of me the price of arms, yet I always remained your friend, but I envy you for the wreath of love.</P>

<SPEAKER>Walt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have only seen the buds, perhaps the blossoms will prosper with you better.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Cuno.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by that? Do you doubt the honor of a knight?—Cuno of Hallwyl has never for∣feited his word, and Elsbeth bears your ring upon her finger.</P>

<P>I expected that of you, noble knight, and thank you for it. But here is not the question, of what <HI>becomes</HI> you, or what <HI>pleases</HI> me?—I give you back your word; Elsbeth only can decide.</P>
