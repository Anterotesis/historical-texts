<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is natural for persons, when they take a discourse into their hands, on the occasion of the following, to enquire after the cause or reason that has given rise to it. To be very particular and minute in the detail would be too tedious. The following may serve to satisfy the candid and impartial inquirer.</P>
<P>The author's situation has been peculiarly difficult, even from his first acquaintance with the place, especially by reason of the long difficulties and divisions that have there subsisted, which were risen to a great height in the days of his honoured prede∣cessor, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. JOSEPH COIT.</NOTE> and were the unhappy means of bringing his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. These difficulties and divisions that have and still subsist, were occasioned by that spirit of discord, sown by the arch-enemy in many of our parishes; whence ma∣ny have undertaken, with freedom, to censure the constitution of the government, and the more common method of ministerial support; exclaiming with vehemence against the churches, as being Antichrist and Babylon; the rulers as ruling for Baol, and their teachers as teaching for lucre, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>This spirit of rancour, bitterness, and division having made a most prodigious progress, many minds were prejudiced, and these prejudices industriously propagated, that there were but few whose minds were not soured by this leaven of wicked∣ness, and became cold in their affections to the ministry. These things rendered the author's support extremely difficult, there being no way to attain it but by mere dint of law; a method the author try'd many years, with reluctance. There being no prospect of times being better, and the society signifying their desire, or willingness, of their pastor's being dismiss'd from his pastoral relation, the motion was made to the church, who at first manifested their unwillingness to concur, being united and in full charity with their pastor; but considering, upon a review, that the ministerial support was from the so∣ciety in conjunction with the church, — that they could not proceed but in consort, — they pass'd a vote (tho' with very
<PB N="6" REF="009000_0004_10307F4E10959B00"/>
great reluctance, being in full charity, as it is express'd in their vote) for the dismission of their reverend pastor, and im∣powered him, in their names, to send to an ecclesiastical coun∣cil for that purpose; which council, in their result, express themselves as follows.</P>
<P>"Considering the many and great difficulties which have long subsisted in this place, and the deep-rooted (thô, as we believe ill-grounded) prejudices which are in the minds of so many against their present pastor, and the little prospect of his being longer useful in this place when so great a majority appear desireous of his removal, (as also Mr. Rowland's earnest desire to be removed) think it best that his pastoral relation to this people be dissolved; and therefore do (thô with reluctance) dissolve the pastoral relation between the rev. Mr. Rowland and the first society and the church in Plainfield. As there have been no charges, of any kind, exhibited against Mr. Rowland, so we freely declare that we know nothing, of any kind, re∣specting him, that can be any disqualification for the work of the gospel ministry; and do very cordially▪ recommend him to any part of the christian church where providence may open a door to his future usefulness."</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS XX, 25—27.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And now behold, I know that ye all among whom I have gone, preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</P>
<P>Therefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</P>
<P>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words now read, are a part of St. Paul's farewel-sermon, delivered to the elders of the church of Ephesus, one of the noted churches, in the Lesser Asia, of which we have an account in the book of the revelation of St. John. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2. beg.—</NOTE> some interpreters suppose the words, tho' immediately directed to the elders of the church, were yet designed to include the whole church. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Calvin in Loc.</NOTE> However it is evident the apostle spent considerable time at Ephesus, that his conduct and behaviour was well known both to mi∣nisters and people, preaching the gospel to them, and la∣bouring for their salvation, not only in their publick syna∣gogues, but also in their private houses, from house to house, as ver. 20. This holy apostle was indefatigable in his labours, and never did, thro' sloth negligence, or weak ti∣midity, sacrifice a good conscience. He faced dangers and defied censure, was ready not only to be bound, but also to die, for the name and honour of Christ; and when bonds and afflictions awaited him, he made no account of them, not esteeming his very life precious to himself on such an occa∣sion, that he might faithfully and joyfully finish his course as a christian, and an apostle, and fulfil the ministry which he had recieved of the Lord Jesus, even to testify the truth, and urge the importance of the glorious gospel of the free and abundant grace of God; a dispensation infinitely
<PB N="8" REF="009000_0006_10307F51872F6E88"/>
glorious, in which the abundant grace of God shines with a lustre not to be equaled, to which we are all indebted, infinitely indebted, ministers and people, far beyond the re∣turns we can ever make. The apostle gloried in the doc∣trines of the cross of Christ, as they contained the most illus∣trious display of divine grace, and were the power of God to the salvation of all that believe, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. i, 16.—</NOTE>. The apostle was so far from being ashamed of the gospel of Christ that he gloried in it; and the impor∣tant truths of it he endeavoured to press upon the minds of those to whom he preached; and at Ephesus he kept back nothing that was profitable unto them <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">V. 20, 21. continued.—</NOTE>; testifying, both to Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith to∣wards our Lord Jesus Christ. And now being about to take his leave of them, he addresses them as in the words of my text: And now behold I know that ye all, my dear brethren, among whom I have gone, shall see my face no more. The words are a Hebraism, for, ye shall not all see my face any more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pool's Synop in loc.</NOTE>. Some suppose that the apostle had it intimated par∣ticularly to him that he should no more come to Ephesus, and therefore never have an opportunity of seeing them to whom he was now addressing himself in the most tender and affectionate manner; <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Doddridge in Loc. and his note on v. 27.</NOTE> therefore he sent for them that he might take his solemn farewel of them, and to testify to them all, that if any of them perish, yet he should be clear from the blood of all men. I testify to you, and God is my witness that I have laboured for your salvation, and the salvation of all that heard me, and have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. He suppress'd nothing that was advantageous or that would promote their edification; he did not avoid nor shun, from any con∣sideration whatsoever, declaring all the counsel of God; he did not withhold or disguise any important truth, nor de∣cline the open publication of it for fear of displeasing those to whom it ought to be declared: But, on the contrary, he delivered the counsel, or will of God, with the greatest sincerity and unreservedness; opening and enforcing the im∣portant
<PB N="9" REF="009000_0007_10307F55ED7E1288"/>
truths relating to our redemption, by Christ, and the way to eternal happiness with him, in the most plain and faithful manner; not regarding the censure and con∣tempt he might incur from the enemies of christianity; deaf to censure, to applause unelate, resolute in the face of dangers, and inflexible to every motive of ease and securi∣ty, he pursued the arduous work he had undertaken, and, like the saints of old, loved not his life to the death <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii, 11.</NOTE>, that is, he exposed himself to the greatest dangers, and met death in the glorious conflict; but he fell to rise, triumph and reign.</P>
<P>But in pursuing the design in view, I shall only take no∣tice of two things in general; where I shall endeavour,</P>
<P N="1">I. To shew you when a minister may be said to shun declaring all the counsel of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. Consider some things included and necessarily impli∣ed in declaring all the counsel of God.</P>
<P>Then I shall make some improvement suitable to our cir∣cumstances in the prospect of our parting.</P>
<P>First then, I am to shew you when a minister may be said to shun declaring all the counsel of God.</P>
<P>He who dare make the most sacred things serve to gratify his own, or the humours of others, or as a cloke to colour over his pride and avarice, is in the most pitiable and unhappy condition. It is a crime too many have been guilty of, trifling with things in their nature sacred, and a profanation unpardonable, were it not that infinite mercy had been exercised in behalf of the greatest sinners, even the chief <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i.15.</NOTE>. Happy had it been for many had the ordinances of Christ never been prostituted to the most base and merce∣nary views for promoting secular interest, and inordinate cravings of a selfish mind; and it would still be more hap∣py, were there no such pernicious and destructive principle prevalent, or so much as to be found in this world; and tho' it is what may not be expected in the present state, to be perfectly free from such an infelicity; yet it is the design of the gospel of the grace of God to purify and re∣fine men, to fit and prepare them for the most noble servi∣ces
<PB N="10" REF="009000_0008_10307F59DB9806A0"/>
in the present state, and to conduct them to a better; to free them, while here, from those evils, and to deliver them from those false biases to which they are so incident; to prompt them to act in the most disinterested manner, with a suitable regard to the honour and glory of God, the wel∣fare of their own, and the souls of others. Men that are in a state of slavery to their lusts, can't well avoid being slaves to the humors of others; and it is a thousand to one, if such do not sacrifice a good conscience thro' weak timi∣dity, and fear of giving offence. —The apostle had not so learned Christ; therefore spake the word with all freedom and boldness, without fear or affection to any man, whe∣ther they would hear or whether they would forbear, con∣scious that he was to God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that perish, and in them that are saved, to the one a savour of life, unto life, but to the other a savour of death unto death. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. ii, 15, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here I shall mention two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A minister may be said to shun declaring all the counsel of God when he don't deliver the doctrines of Christ in a plain and intelligible manner, when he endeavours to con∣ceal himself under unintelligible phrases, and an uncertain manner of expressing himself, that his hearers are at a loss to know what the plain design of his expressions import. — The doctrines of Christ are of the last concern to mankind; their well-being and blessedness nearly, yea necessarily de∣pends upon their being well understood; without this kind of knowledge the heart can't be good <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix, 2.</NOTE>, there can be no en∣joyment of the chief good, no well-grounded hope of eter∣nal life. —If the opportunities enjoyed for instruction are doubtful and uncertain what hope of reaping profit and ad∣vantage from them? The stile in which a minister addres∣ses his audience, ought not on the one hand to be jejune and flat, so as to render his administrations contemptible, nor on the other hand, too florid and bombast, that they can't be recieved by persons of an ordinary size: he ought ra∣ther to study a graceful decent and plain method of com∣municating, that his words, fitly spoken, may be like ap∣ples
<PB N="11" REF="009000_0009_10307F5DD5594560"/>
of Gold in pictures of silver <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv, 11.</NOTE>. The apostle Paul plainly intimates to us this as his manner of preaching <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii, 1▪ 4.</NOTE>; And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excel∣lency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testi∣mony of God; my speech and my preaching was not with enticeing words of mens wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit, and of power; not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. The apostle lets the Corinthians know that his aim and manner a∣mong them, even from the begining, was not with the pomp of language, no, far very far from affecting such a method to engage their affections, he kept in view the great design of the gospel, which was admirably calculated to stain the pride of human glory; he had no need of affecting the sublimity and subtilty made use of among the Greeks of that age; the gospel needed not any ornaments of human invention, nor could the laboured charms of eloquence or philosophy give lustre or emphasis to it: he therefore endea∣voured to exhibit it in as intelligible a method as he could; treating it as coming from God: in such a manner should the ministers of Christ address themselves to their people, then might they, with juster reason, hope for the happy suc∣cess of their administrations, and that their hearers might grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and savi∣our Jesus Christ. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii, 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>The knowledge of things divine is, in its nature, the most excellent, and most directly tends to the welfare and happiness of such as are made effectually acquainted with them, that to prevent, and embarrass the truths of God, by a doubtful and unintelligible method of explication is an evil almost unpardonable.</P>
<P N="2">2. A minister may be said to shun declaring all the coun∣sel of God when he makes use of uncertain and ambiguous words or phrases in his explication of gospel truths. This being the case, it looks like artifice and design, a method to conceal himself from censure and intitle himself to a good living. To make use of uncertain modes of expression, and certain phrases to which there is no fixt determinate
<PB N="12" REF="009000_0010_10307F5FCC72CC50"/>
ideas, or, least, they are ambiguous and doubtful, may be understood in a proper or less proper sense, which leaves the hearer in a state of suspence and uncertainty what the speaker intends; this is supposed in withholding a full de∣claration of the will of God; it is to disguise it, that it may appear what it really is not, to shun and avoid representing of it, in its native simplicity <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Leigh's Critica Sacra.</NOTE>. If the preacher study an art∣ful method of communicating himself, and frequently make use of ambiguous terms in his explication of some of the doctrines of the gospel, will not his hearers suspect whether he believe them or not, or, if he does, that he esteems them of little importance, meer speculation! and, of course, they, with an air of indifference if not of contempt treat the most important realities! —This is a character unworthy a mi∣nister of the gospel, an embassador of the Lord of hosts. A simplicity of expression, as well as manners, free from force formality hypocricy and deceit, is the proper cha∣racteristick of such as preach the gospel; and an honest up∣right and unreserv'd method of communicating and enforce∣ing the truth of the gospel ought to be very eminent and conspicuous in them. This the apostle Paul proposes as the real and genuine character of christianity, its natural and proper effect; and it was the consciousness he had of his own integrity, plain-heartedness, freedom from deceit and guile that animated him in the discharge of his embassy a∣midst the clamours and reproaches thrown upon him by sons of malice slander and falshood: Our rejoicing (saith he) is this, the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity with godly sincerity <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i, 12.</NOTE>, maintaining a sense of the divine presence and inspection (the surest guard unto unfeigned in∣tegrity) we live in the world.—This holy apostle studied always the most artless method of conduct, at all times and in all places; he abhorred the notion of deceit and guile, as methods below the christian and the apostle <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii, 16. This text has been shamefully perverted by some, when they have improved it to justify the low artifices they have used to bring others to their faith and practice. The apostle mentions it as an invidious insinuation of his ad∣versaries, and speaks of it with abhorrence.</NOTE>. The secret conciousness of his integrity supported him, in the
<PB N="13" REF="009000_0011_10307F63089B1448"/>
most couragious efforts, animated him in the midst of dan∣gers, and gave him a fortitude of mind suited to the dig∣nity, and difficulties of his office. In his enforceing the truths and duties of the gospel, he behaved in the most unaffected manner: Our exhortation (saith he) was not of deceit, or of uncleanness, nor in guile <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. ii, 3.</NOTE>; it was not found∣ed on any principles of deceit, he had no mercenary or sensu∣al purposes to serve, there was nothing of guile or crafti∣ness, no under-handedness, nothing that could fear the de∣tection of the strictest scrutiny, all was fair open simple and artless.</P>
<P N="3">3. A minister may be said to shun declaring all the counsel of God when he withholds the truth, or any part of the truth, thro' fear, or affection to the person of any man.</P>
<P>It is the apostolick character of a minister of Jesus Christ, that he pleases not man, but God.—Do I (saith the apostle) seek to please men? for if I yet please men, I should not be the servant of Christ <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. i, 10.</NOTE>. He that complies with the pre∣judices, sooths the humours, and flatters the vanity of his hearers, deserves not the name of a christian, much less of a minister; for he that acts as an ambassador of the prince of peace, must not in the discharge of his embassy be influ∣enced by the censure, or applause of mortals, whose breath goeth forth and they are no more, nor should he by any means study an accommodation to the taste and prejudices of sensual minds: —it is much becoming his character and office to labour at all times, to secure, above all things, the approbation of God, who trieth the heart, with the greatest exactness and care <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. ii, 4.</NOTE>: We speak not (saith the apostle) as plea∣sing men, but God,—nor did we (says he) deal in flattering words "to insinuate ourselves into your affections, and sooth you in your sins, as ye well know, nor had we recourse to a pretence of piety to promote the schemes of covetousness, often artfully conducted under the covert of religious zeal: God is our witness, that we were far above every thing of this kind, and made all such views our first sacrifice to the glory of his name, and propagation of his gospel▪ nor did we seek glory or applause of men, such among whom we
<PB N="14" REF="009000_0012_10307F64B60FC478"/>
have laboured and conversed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Doddridge's Paraphrase.</NOTE>." No, these views are far, very far, from influencing the minds of the ministers of Christ, tho' oftentimes they get much illwill and hatred by it. Unhappy indeed must it be for the church of Christ if any who minister at God's altar should sacrifice truth to the affection, or favour of men. This would most certain∣ly be a threatning omen to the church, as it is the first step towards giving up all revealed religion: if a part may be so prophanely sacrificed, why may not the whole?—How unreasonable and wicked, even to a prodigy, such fear, or condescension! Our hearers have almost as many tastes as complections; but they are like men sick with a fever, who can't relish the most proper food, for the nourishment of the body, or the disordered stomach that hankers for that which is most unnatural and hurtful.—One censures the preacher because he imagines he's too rigid in the doctrine of man's apostacy by the first Adam,—too much insists up∣on the moral impotency of mankind; another, because he fancies he's little short of blasphemy, in his explication of the decrees of God, that therein he saps the very founda∣tion of the sinner's endeavours after grace and holiness;— others, because they suppose that he is too stiff in his notions of the free justification of a sinner before God, by the per∣fect righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, efficacious grace, &amp;c.— some, because he don't insist enough upon topicks of the like nature;—others, because he don't particularly and sufficiently display the excellencies, and recommend the pro∣fit and advantages of moral vertue:—one cavils at his dress, another at his air:—some because he writes and reads his discourses, and some because he is able to do it:—one be∣cause he is flat and lifeless, another because he has too much fervor and pathos. Thus they go on in a circle of uneasi∣ness, as restless as the troubled sea, discovering a childish temper and disposition, never pleased but when humour∣ed. If every minute part of their minister's conduct whe∣ther in publick private or domestick life, don't quadrate with their notions, he's no minister for them, be his morals and doctrines as unexceptionable as the gospel.—He that under∣takes
<PB N="15" REF="009000_0013_10307F6B9C7CE478"/>
the task of gratifying the humours of his hearers, will never be able to perform it. He that sets out to please one or all will be sure to please none at all; for it is as easy for a man to serve God and mammon, as for a minister of Jesus Christ to serve the humours, the peculiarities of his people, and discharge, suitably discharge the duties of his sacred office. The servant of the Lord should be well-stu∣died and fix'd in the doctrines of the gospel, not hesitating, or in the least wavering; not afraid or ashamed to own and recommend the truths of the gospel;—and well esta∣blished in the various parts and branches of his office; then, with unwearied diligence, to pursue the duties of his cal∣ling, leaving the event.—They should cry aloud and spare not, lift up their voice like a trumpet <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Is. v, 8, 1.</NOTE>, be Boanerges, sons of thunder, to awaken and alarm sleepy sinners, and stop bold transgressors in their full career to endless misery and ruin, and, Barnabas-like, sons of consolation, to comfort such as mourn in Zion, to raise up the bowed down, to strengthen the hands and encourage the hearts of the people of God, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Is. iv, 1, 2.</NOTE> keeping the main end of their embassy in view, doing nothing by parti∣ality in favour of one more than another, according to the inducements of private interest, friendship, or affection, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, that they may know that there has been a prophet among them <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Exek. ii, 5.</NOTE>. But,</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to consider some things included and necessarily implied in declaring all the counsel of God.</P>
<P>A minister's declaring all the counsel of God, must sup∣pose that he lays before his people the whole system of divine truths, relating to the being, perfections and pro∣vidence of God, our fall by the first, and recovery by the second Adam; these truths are necessary to our well understand∣ing the terms of the gospel, and way to eternal life and happiness, by Jesus Christ; nothing should be kept back or disguised for fear of giving offence. It too often happens that a minister's plain and pungent method of address gives offence, tho' it be with the utmost prudence▪ both in air and expression <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No small degree of wisdom and prudence ought to be used in our addresses that are plain and pungent, for I am very far from thinking that it consists in a bold im∣perious and domineering method of treating our fellow-men, as though they were beasts of burden, obliged to bear whatever in laid upon them, or meer machines to be set in motion by vehement exclamations.</NOTE>, especialy when it crosses some humour, or
<PB N="16" REF="009000_0014_10307F6D5826EC20"/>
inclination, some prejudice in favour of their peculiar set of thoughts. Regardless of private interest or affection should he who acts as a minister of the prince of peace, speak the word with all freedom and boldness, as he ought to speak. It will be impracticable for me to go over all the particular branches that naturally suggest themselves un∣der this head; I shall, with as much brevity as may be, and time will allow, touch at a few.—</P>
<P N="1">1. It must suppose a suitable illustration of the being and perfections of the divine nature. That God is, is the first article in the christian creed. He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi.6.</NOTE>. Religion is wholly founded upon the doctrine of the one infinitely glorious, perfect and all-sufficient being, who hath made the heavens, and the earth, and all things that in them are, by the word of his power. Thus it is said, He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his discretion. When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: He maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jer. x, 12, 13.</NOTE>. This righteous being is the sole object of religious worship and homage, as in himself he is the most excellent being, capable, from the infinite source of good in himself, to communicate to the needy circumstances of his creatures, and whose infinite compassi∣on and pity has moved him to provide for the relief of fal∣len ruined man, a saviour and sacrifice all-sufficient. It is a theme suitable to the sacred desk seasonably to discant up∣on the perfections of the divine nature whether natural or moral, that our esteem of him may be raised and our ob∣ligations of obedience be enforced.—O Lord my God thou art very great; who stretchest out the heavens as a curtain,
<PB N="17" REF="009000_0015_10307F6F083D6BB8"/>
who coverest thyself with light, as with a garment: <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psal. civ, 1, 2.</NOTE> who stretchest out the north over the empty space, and hangest the earth upon nothing<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job xxvi, 7.</NOTE>: seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and turneth the shadow in the morning and mak∣eth the day dark with night <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Amos v, 8.</NOTE>:—The heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament sheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, night unto night sheweth know∣ledge: there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their line is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix, 1-4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. It must suppose, that we endeavour to impress the minds of our hearers with a suitable sense of the agency of God in all providential events. It is extremely natural for man∣kind to misjudge things, and call them what they be not; so to attribute the most surprizing events meerly to the skill prudence and sagacity of themselves or others, or those un∣meaning words Fate or Chance; and by such a mistaken view of things they eclipse the glory of the divine agency, that divine agency which produces every event by a secret but powerful influence upon second causes operating for such pur∣poses. Now these mistakes men so naturaly run into should be corrected, and a firm unshaken belief of the divine provi∣dence established.</P>
<P>He that created all things by the word of his power, up∣holds and disposes them, according to his wisdom, and by the same word of his power: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. i.3.</NOTE> he alone is independent and self-sufficient, therefore the idea of a creature implies depend∣ence; that which depends upon God for being must for its continuance in being. There is an unremitted exertion of divine power, call'd the divine manutention, by which we live move and act: accordingly the apostle observes that it is in Him we live, in him we move, in him we have our being, and in him are all our ways. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii, 28.</NOTE> —God is said, according to the fix'd laws of nature, to preserve his creatures by the in∣strumentality of second causes.

<PB N="18" REF="009000_0016_10307F70B68B5930"/>
are communicated to us by second causes, under the direction of a wise providence, which it is as much to be ascribed to, as tho' produced without any such means.

<P>How many great and surprizing events are produced by what are call'd second causes? this supposes a first, by which all others are guided and directed! this can be no creature, since it is peculiar to the Glorious God; all act under his influence, his providence, the greatest and the least are equally under the influence of his providence, and dependent upon Him.

so evident. Yet, as to the rise of moral evil, there have been many warm and disadvantageous controversies; yet there have been some which have thrown much light be∣fore our eyes, manifesting these important truths of God, and guarding us against the dangers we are exposed to by false judging.</P>
<P>If we attend closely to the account the sacred pages give us of this matter, and judge of them in the most plain easy and intelligible manner, without force, sophistry, or allegory, we must conclude we have guilt derived to us from our feederal head, Adam: by the offence of this one, many are made sinners, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ro. v. 19.</NOTE> they become obnoxious to death, exposed to the anger and wrath of almighty God, in time and in eternity.

<P>I pass to some improvement of my subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. What has been observed may serve to shew us wherein the unfaithfulness of a minister principally consists; it is not in neglecting some peculiar things, supposed necessary by some, and on which they may lay great weight, though they have no express warrant from the word of God to justify them in their peremptory assertions: but when he witholds the truth, and don't deliver it with that plainness and simplicity the gospel requires; when he keeps back something that might be for the profit and advantage of his hearers, there can be no motive or excuse suffiicent to justify such a neglect. It is the principal and main branch of the ministerial office to de∣clare all the counsel of God, to understand what is most con∣ducive to the good of the people; wherefore he is to study to shew himself approved to God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii, 15.</NOTE> He who performs this embassy with a careless indifferency, or only with a view to serve himself and gratify the humours of his hearers; he who, thro' fear of some and affection to others, dare not speak, in plain and intelligible language, the great truths and important duties of religion, and entertains his audience with empty harangues, or with noisy ignorance, designed to raise their affections, rather than inform their judgments; that amuses his hearers with ridiculous tales, and a clamourous sound without any meaning, this is to prophane the sacred office, and to be guilty in such an important branch of it, as renders him criminally negligent. What an aw∣ful and tremendous account will the unfaithful steward be call'd to at last, when he leaves his clay-tenement and en∣ters
<PB N="24" REF="009000_0022_10307F8593CE6F40"/>
the unknown somewhere! what a heavy sinking doom may he justly expect! separated and forever banished from the presence, the enjoyment of God, the chief the all-suffici∣ent good; the society and happy employment of angels and saints, who before the throne of God join the sacred songs of praise to God and the Lamb! — What anguish and horror shall they feel when deprived of every good, and supported to bear the most acute pain horror and anguish; and when all the opportunities they have enjoyed, all the prayers, sermons, and invitations made to others, shall serve but to enhance to aggrivate their own misery and torment!</P>
<P N="2">2. We hence see wherein the duty of the ministers of Christ principally consists: it is express'd by the apostle, by not shunning to declare all the counsel of God. That mi∣nister that acts his part well, that faithfully discharges his embassy, will, in an open free unreserved manner, apply the truths of the gospel, according to their nature and impor∣tance. To preach the gospel is to preach Christ; and to preach Christ is to preach his word. This is the solemn charge given to ministers, Preach the word: be instant in season and out of season: reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv, 2.</NOTE> Preaching the gospel is the great duty, the principal branch of the ministerial work, and all other things should be done in subserviency to it. It is first in the commission, Go, teach all nations; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii.19.</NOTE> or (as it is expressed by another of the evangelists) Go, preach the gos∣pel to every creature<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi, 15.</NOTE>. Ministers are Christ's heralds, and in the execution of their office, they are to proclaim the awful terrors of God's firey law, in the surprizing accents of Sinai's dreadful thunder, to awaken the secure, to alarm the lethargic. They must cry aloud &amp; not spare, lift up their voice like a trumpet &amp; shew God's people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Is. lviii, 1.</NOTE>. He must sound the jubilee trumpet of the gos∣pel, and proclaim liberty to captives, the opening of the pri∣son door to them that are bound; proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God, com∣fort all that mourn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is. lxi, 1, 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009000_0023_10307F8743725EB8"/>Some are bold and impudent enough to say, that preaching the gospel is the least part of the ministerial office; but such are wise above what is written. The apostle St. Paul, who well understood the duties of his office, had views of things very different from such dictators: he esteemed it the principal branch of his office, as an apostle and minister. He saith, Christ sent me not to baptize, i. e. not so much to baptize, as to preach the gospel <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i, 17.</NOTE>. This he considered as his principal, his main business, by which he was to bring persons to that faith which would intitle them to the blessings of the gospel. By preaching the gospel mens eyes were to be opened, and they turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi, 17, 18.</NOTE>. This is the grand design of the gospel, the important end in view, and the medium for its accomplishment is preaching all the counsel of God. If such as make the objection, mean only the deli∣very of a discourse, it is just: but it must be remembered that preaching the gospel necessarily includes every thing requisite to it, as reading, study, meditation, and prayer, and when it is considered in its necessary connection, it is, as it will appear in this view, the grand, the most important part of the ministerial function. The unscriptural and unreasona∣ble notion that too many have of a minister's spending a great part, if not all his time in visits, is at most but a dis∣cretionary business, except in cases of sickness, and the like; it is discretionary because there is no positive command for it, and there being no positive command for it, it must be left, as it is, to the ministers own discretion, and not ano∣another's; and performed as his leisure will admit and prudence dictates. A practice of this business, in ordinary cases, would, I presume, be more likely to be disservicea∣ble than beneficial. And as it is nor an essential branch of the ministerial office, and not strictly enjoined in common cases▪ so he must be determined by the knowledge he has of persons and their circumstances, and so conducting he is accountable to none. But in preaching the gospel he ought to lay himself out in the best manner, and exert himself
<PB N="26" REF="009000_0024_10307F88F546AC00"/>
most vigorously, that he may save himself and those that hear him,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix, 27.</NOTE> preach the gospel like a workman that need∣eth not to be ashamed, which requires much pains labour sweat and toil. To be well furnished with the most proper and wholesome food for the soul, calls for the greatest at∣tention and care. There are other things that belong to the ministerial office, such as ordination and dispensing the cen∣sures of the church. But preaching the gospel ought to be the first thing in view, as this is the method instituted by infinite wisdom for the salvation of precious and immor∣tal souls. It hath pleased God, by the preaching of the gospel, to save them that believe<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i, 21.</NOTE>: therefore being the insti∣tuted means of salvation, by which men are brought to faith, repentance and final happiness, it should be first in our esteem, and prosecuted with the utmost ardour of mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. It must certainly give a minister comfort and satisfacti∣on in the near approach of death, or a separation from his people, to have a consciousness of his not having shunned to declare all the counsel of God. At such times will they most surely recollect, and call to mind their past behaviour and conduct; and if, upon the most narrow search and scru∣tiny, they can find they have acted in the discharge of their embassy as stewards of the manifold grace of God, tho' their sercives have been attended with weakness, and much imperfection, they are safe and secure; tho' malice and en∣vy, prejudice and ill-will may slander and defame them, they stand firm in their integrity, and as unmoved as the rock against which the angry waves dash, and retire with shame. Our rejoicing, is this, the testimony of our con∣science, that "our aims in religion have been noble, and our conduct simple and uniform;—then may we look upon the applauses or the censures of men as comparatively a very light matter." We aim at pleasing God rather than man, and in the discharge of our important work to gain his approbation; and thô this be principal with us, we, upon a careful review, find a thousand deficiencies to humble us before God; for these we implore his pardon and forgive∣ness, as also our people's. We are, as other our fellow-men,
<PB N="27" REF="009000_0025_10307F8F3984A7B8"/>
while cloathed with mortality, imperfect; so also must be our best services, that it is by the grace of God we obtain mercy to be faithful, and pure from the blood of souls: Oh! that we might ever be successful, that at last we might shine as the brightness of the firmament, and hav∣ing turned many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. xii, 3.</NOTE> With such a divine temper of mind may we meet the most threatening evils and dangers, yea, death itself shall be disarmed, and the saying that is written come to pass; Death is swallow'd up in victory. O death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory? <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxv, 8. 1 Cor. xv, 54, 55.</NOTE></P>
<P>This consciousness, I have mentioned, gives satisfaction in the near approach of a minister's separation from his people. Things are brought to such a pass, that the relation that has so long subsisted between myself and this church and people, must soon be dissolved <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">My relation to the church and people in Plainfield, commenced March 17, A.

I have not kept back or witheld from you any thing that, upon the most mature deliberation, I could think would be profitable, but have laboured to declare all the counsel of God.

I have endea∣voured to impress your minds with a sense of your danger out of Christ, of his readiness to receive you upon your applica∣tion to him, and to bestow all that good upon you that you need. He gives grace and glory and witholds no good from his servants, his promises he will faithfully accomplish, for in Christ they are all yea and amen. Furthermore I have en∣deavoured to enforce upon you, a cordial and unfeigned o∣bedience to the laws of Christ, as your bounden duty, as creatures of God, made upheld and preserved by him, and as evidential of your union to, and interest in him; subjecti∣on to civil magistracy for the Lord's sake; a careful dis∣charge of personal and domestick duties; a strict observation of the Lord's day, &amp;c.—I have visited you in your times of sickness, and on your mourning occasions; and have endeavoured to suggest to your minds, at such times and on such occasions, the most suitable thoughts and meditati∣ons, to assist and help you to honour God in your afflicti∣ons, and that you might reap the advantage and profit of them to your souls. On your days of humiliation I have endeavoured to lead your minds to a serious reflection up∣on those things which, in their own nature, portend evil and threaten God's people with wasting and desolating judgments, and to persuade you to reform every evil, to convince you of your dependence upon a divine providence. On your seasons of praise I have attempted to lead in your solemn devotion, to assist your minds with the greatness of the mercy you enjoy'd, that your goodness your righteous∣ness have not procured the favours you were celebrating, but the great mercy and goodness of God: he rules in the kingdoms of men, and doth his pleasure without controul; he doth wonderful things, his right hand and his holy arm gets him the victory.</P>
<P N="4">4. We hence see that where all the counsel of God is de∣clared, finally impenitent sinners must be left inexcusable. If the ministers of Christ are pure from the blood of souls,

because they have not shunned to declare all the counsel of God, then their blood must rest upon their own heads; and in what awful circumstances will the sinner at last be found, who has had advantages of attaining the knowledge of God, and his son Jesus Christ, but has neglected and mis∣improved them! It had been better for such gospel-despis∣ers they had never been born; they shall mourn, at the last, when their harvest is past and their summer ended, and when they are convinced, by woful experience, that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who will be to such as are found out of Christ a consum∣ing fire.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii, 29.</NOTE> O! how will they abide the coming of their judge, when he shall make his appearance, in flames of devouring fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power! <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. i, 8, 9.</NOTE> such who remain deaf to the voice of mercy and irreclaimable in the paths of iniquity, shall be covered with shame and confusion in the day of final account, for they shall have no plea, no excuse for their sin <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John xv, 22.</NOTE> and if they who despis∣ed Moses's law, died without mercy, of how much sorer punishment shall they be thought worthy who have tramp∣led under foot the son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing? <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. x, 28, 29.</NOTE> It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah, than for such gos∣pel-despisers; <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Math. xi, 24.</NOTE> as their privileges and advantages have been greater, more eminent, so their condemnation, their misery will be more terrible and severe.

Sabbath-sanctity has a very great and eminent influence upon us, and is of vast service to mankind in general.—Honour the ministers of Christ as his ambassadors, who, for the sake of their office, are worthy of double honour; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v, 17.</NOTE> let their feet, their very footsteps, be beautiful, that preach the gospel of peace and bring you tidings of good things.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Is. lii▪ 7.</NOTE> They are men, like yourselves, and subject to numberless imperfections, as well as a dissolution of the human frame; so that you see the treasure is in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may appear to be of God, and not of us.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv, 7.</NOTE> Esteem them as precious gifts of Christ, a legacy he hath bequeathed his church out of his tender care and concern for it: Esteem their office too sacred to be invaded by pride and ignorance. It must be a bold piece of presumption to break open the sa∣cred inclosure, and a wickedness like that of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, who invaded the priests office,* which tho' God don't punish in so visible a manner, yet will, no doubt, with judicial blindness and stupefaction, by giving them up to be∣lieve a lye, that they may be damned. ¶ Detest such a wick∣edness, and prevent its spread as much as you can. Stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men. Be strong. Never con∣tent yourselves without the stated administration of gospel ordinances, according to divine institution. Look to him who is the lord of the harvest, that he would give you a pastor af∣ter his heart, that may feed you with knowledge and under∣standing. Believe his promises, rely upon his faithfulness, and trust in his mercy; then shall neither tribulation nor dis∣tress nor persecution nor famine nor nakedness nor peril nor sword nor death nor life nor angels nor any other creature separate you from the Love of Christ. §</P>
<P>To Conclude. — Let us all seriously think of the solemn change that is hastening upon us, when we that are now in the house of God, uniting in our prayers and religious hom∣age, shall be stretched in the dust of death, and our souls

must enter the world of unbodied spirits, to appear before the judge of all the earth. It is but a little while, and he that shall come, will come and not tarry. May we, when Christ who is our life shall appear, appear with him in glory. May we enter the new Jerusalem that is above, riding as in a triumphant chariot, be honoured by God, and the holy angels, and join the blessed society in their songs of praise to the sacred three in one. There shall crowns of unfading glory encir∣cle our victorious brows; there shall palms adorn our hands, songs of victory and triumph shall dwell on our tongues; and we shall be free from sighing, and tears shall forever be wiped from our eyes. That this may be the happy por∣tion of each in this assembly, is the fervent wish and un∣feigned desire of him who now bids you his hearty Fare∣wel. Finally, brethren, Farewel.—Be perfect. Be of good comfort. Be of one mind. Live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii, 11.</NOTE></P>
