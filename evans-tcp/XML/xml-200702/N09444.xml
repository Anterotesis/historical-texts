I am persuaded, not∣withstanding many persons, both of high and low character, through prejudice and party-zeal, have attempted to eclipse the reputation of our deceased friend, your Excellency, from your own personal acquaintance and knowledge, could clearly discern in him,</HI> the honest man, the faithful friend, the polite Gentleman, and the lover of mankind.—<HI>Perhaps the present age cannot furnish us with another character equal in every respect to his,—if we take a view of the many un∣common oppositions and difficulties he met with, the great num∣ber of avocations that engaged his attention, the extent of his itinerations and correspondence, together with the frequency

of his preaching; add to these, his trials in private life, which those who knew him can testify were not a few: These, and many other things that might be mentioned, sufficiently in∣dicate the surprizing activity of his disposition, and point him out to the admiration of posterity as a very extraordinary man. As to the important doctrines he preached, and so warmly in∣culcated, tho' they may not coincide with the sentiments of ma∣ny of our modern Divines, yet, it is evident, he had the ar∣ticles, homilies, and liturgy of the established church, and the concurrent testimony of all foreign Protestant churches, on his side.</HI>—When he died, the poor lost a father—<HI>tender of their relief, he, like his great master, went about doing good.—What numbers in this province hath he not relieved and assisted by the most useful charity,</HI> that of employing them in labour; <HI>a charity the more agreeable to him, as it seemed to take off the force of an obligation from those who were so employed.

<P>O THOU ever blessed and adorable Redeemer, who art God over all blessed for evermore, glo∣ry be to thy free grace, who hast promised that where two or three are gathered together thou wilt be in the midst of them: Be in the midst of us, gracious God, at this time; let thy power be known and felt a∣mong us; draw near unto us at this, and at every op∣portunity; when we draw near unto thee, in thy pub∣lick service, may we find thee a God nigh unto us in all that we call upon thee for.—But will God, in very deed, dwell with men on the earth? Behold, Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee; how much less these houses that are built for thy worship and service? Yet have respect to the prayer of thy un∣worthy servant, and to his supplication. O Lord my God, hearken unto the cry, and the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee. O that thine eyes may be open upon this house, day and night, which we are now assembled to dedicate and set apart to thy worship and service. Bless this chapel in a peculiar manner with thy divine presence; bless all that shall at any time admi∣nister thy holy word and sacraments in this place; may they be men called and fitted by thee for their sacred offices: Endue them with a divine power; make them successful in all their ministrations, that spiritual chil∣dren may here be born unto thee. Bless all thy people that shall at any time assemble in this house to meet thee in thine ordinances; may they not depart without a blessing, and enjoy communion and fellowship with thee, the Father of their mercies, and the God of all their consolation. Clothe thy priests with righteous∣ness, and make thy saints shout aloud for joy. May sinners be converted, and thy people edified, and built up in their most holy faith, by all the labours of thy

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Matthew xviii. 20.</BIBL>
<Q>Where two or three are gathered to∣gether in my Name, there am I in the Midst of them.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words our dear Redeemer spoke to his Disciples, and in them to all succeeding ages of the church, as an encouragement to be∣lievers in every generation to assemble themselves to∣gether in his name, to offer their prayers and praises unto him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous light, to meet together for the due celebra∣tion of all divine ordinances, and to pay every act of divine worship to him who hath translated them from the power of <HI>Satan</HI> into the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>IN the former part of the chapter he had been teach∣ing them a lesson of humility, by setting a little child before them, as an answer to their question, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven? and told them, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter therein.</P>
<P>AND, having taught them how to behave towards offending brethren, he proceeds in the verse before our text: Again I say unto you, if two of you shall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father, who is in Hea∣ven; for—where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <HI>If two of you,</HI> who are united to me by faith, shall agree, shall be of one mind, <HI>as touching any thing</HI> you stand in need of for the advancement of your temporal or eternal in∣terest, and shall be desirous of making known your re∣quest by prayer and supplication unto God, and shall ask in faith, and in such a manner as is well-pleasing in
<PB N="10" REF="012034_0009_0F8971AD337F4DC8"/>
his sight, <HI>it shall be done for you,</HI> it shall be granted you of my Father, who is in Heaven; <HI>for, whatsoever you ask the Father in my name he will give it you;</HI> for the Fa∣ther loveth you, because you have loved me, and <HI>where two or three,</HI> so small a number, so sincere a few, <HI>are gathered together in my name,</HI> trusting to my merits and mediation, with a due and proper sense both of my majesty and my mercy, and acknowledging me to be both God and man, and <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and build upon me the only foundation of all their hopes and hap∣piness in time and eternity, <HI>there am I</HI> spiritually pre∣sent, ready to hear and answer their requests, to suc∣cour and defend their persons, to fulfil their petitions, and supply all their wants—<HI>there am I in the midst of them.</HI></P>
<P>BELOVED—This day we are assembled in order to set apart this place for worshipping the greatest and best of beings, the most high God, the possessor of Heaven and earth, the God who ruleth over all, but who is the covenant God of the real Christian, his great Creator, his all-merciful Redeemer and ever-blessed Sanctifier; and this office hath devolved upon unworthy me. Had it been the will of him who doth as he pleases among the armies of Heaven, and among the inhabiters of the earth, on whom the lives of all men depend, that the founder of this house had been continued to have seen the utmost of his desires compleated, in regard to this institution, and to have himself spoken to us on this occasion, with what pleasure should I have attended, and, I believe I may add, with what pleasure would most of you have attended to the words in season, which no doubt he would have delivered with his usual energy on this solemnity.</P>
<P>BUT the supreme disposer of all human events hath seen fit to order it otherwise, and in this providence speaketh unto us as he did unto <HI>Peter</HI> on another oc∣casion:
<PB N="11" REF="012034_0010_0F8971AEBB8463A0"/>
What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter, as tho' he said, if thou art waiting upon me in the ways of my appointment, and depend∣ing upon my divine teaching, tho' thou seest not the reason of my actions, and knowest not NOW what I do, that is, the reason of my so doing, thou shalt know it hereafter, when thy faith is swallowed up in enjoyment, thy hope turned into fruition, and thy love made per∣fect in the kingdom of my glory; then, and not before, thou shalt see that all my proceedings with the children of men were ordered for the best, and so as to secure my glory and their good.</P>
<P>IT is therefore our duty to submit and acquiesce in the will of God, and we shall find less difficulty in so doing, if, with an eminent Divine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Doctor Pemberton's sermon, page 22.</NOTE> in his funeral ser∣mon for our deceased friend, we consider, that, though <Q>separated from the society of his friends below, he is united to the nobler society above of Angels and Archangels, and the spirits of just men made per∣fect.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE view him there, not as perishing in the dust of death, but as entered into a world of glory. We behold him worshipping before the throne of God, not with a company of frail imperfect mortals, but with the general assembly and church of the first-born, shining in the unspotted robes of holiness, u∣niting in hosannahs and partaking of their respective triumphs.</Q> Our loss therefore is his eternal gain, and, glory be to our good God, if we are of the number of his faithful servants, there is the same eternal inheri∣tance, the same glorious crown before us; after these we are aspiring, and, if we are preserved faithful a little longer, the day of death will come, (that happy
<PB N="12" REF="012034_0011_0F8971AFAE654DD8"/>
day to the real believer, that woeful, dreadful day to the men of this world) and put us in full possession of them; then, with our deceased friend, we shall meet around the throne, and join with Cherubims and Sera∣phims, and the whole Hierarchy of Heaven, in ascrib∣ing salvation, OUR salvation, to God and the Lamb for evermore.</P>
<P>I HAVE chosen, on this occasion, the words I have read to you, and in some measure explained, and hope they are not altogether unsuitable to our present meet∣ing, as they strongly <HI>imply</HI> the duty of assembling our∣selves together for the worship of God, and more strong∣ly <HI>express</HI> the advantages we may expect and derive there∣from.—Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</P>
<P>IN this order I intend to discourse upon them, and to draw some suitable inferences, and may the spirit of God help both you and me to make a proper improve∣ment of the whole.</P>
<P>MAN, at first created, and still preserved by him, who is the maker of all things, both in Heaven and earth, e∣ven by that God in whom we live, move, and have our being, is under the strongest obligation to pay him ho∣mage and adoration. It is a principle so deeply rooted in man's reason and conscience, that, of all the nations of the earth, few, if any, but what have had some me∣thod of testifying their belief of a supreme being, and have invented something, which they have made their God; to which they have paid some kind of honour and worship. But to us, who are under the Christian dispensation; God has so clearly revealed his mind and will, that we shall be left entirely without excuse, if we do not give him the glory due unto his name; a duty incumbent on us to perform, not only in private,
<PB N="13" REF="012034_0012_0F8971B036AE3EC8"/>
and in our families, in our morning and evening sacri∣fices of devotion, but also publickly in those places that are peculiarly set apart for his worship and service; there we are to assemble and meet together to offer up our joint prayers and supplications, and to hear his word read and preached by his servants, his ministers, for our mutual edification and comfort.</P>
<P>AND this, if we are really and truly Christians, we shall esteem our highest honour, our greatest privilege; for we shall then, if we are such, attend these publick ordinances for religious worship, not out of form and custom, as is the case with too too many—not merely for an example to others, but to meet our God in them—to enjoy in his house communion with him, whose presence is better than life—to hear what God the Lord will speak concerning us, who speaks to his people, and to his saints, that they return not to folly.</P>
<P>FOR these reasons churches, chapels, and publick edifices, are erected, that we may decently and conve∣niently worship God in publick congregation; but sorry am I to see they are, in general, so little frequented. Tho' our duty to God, and the laws of our country, enjoin our attendance, many never enter the inside of a church, and with what reluctance do others formally attend now and then? They seem as it were to drag their bodies only thither, and leave their souls behind them. Others sleep away the time, while others, who can hardly keep their eyes open, shew, by their coun∣tenance, how agreeably they are entertained; were you to judge others by their behaviour, you would suppose them at some publick place of diversion by their light∣ness and indecent carriage: Few, very few, seem to be actuated by proper motives, and behave like those who understand the important business they are engaged in. And all the while, they think themselves very good
<PB N="14" REF="012034_0013_0F8971B0F3D8B098"/>
Christians, and would be greatly offended to be thought otherwise. But is not such a conduct a shame to Christi∣anity? The name without the thing will be of no ser∣vice to you; away with such Christianity from the earth. Our Christianity, our religion, is not worth any thing, if it does not influence the whole man, make us wiser and better, and regulate our whole lives and conversa∣tions. Renounce your profession, or live agreeably to it.—For God's, for your soul's sake, live as Christians, or else you disown Christianity. The name without the thing will but aggravate your condemnation.</P>
<P>AS publick worship is the duty of all who are called Christians, therefore let us, if we are really as well as nominally so, not forsake the assembling ourselves to∣gether for divine worship, as the manner of some is, who thereby not only neglect their duty, but despise their privilege.</P>
<P>LET such as are real believers exhort one another to a due and constant attendance upon publick worship, and to wait upon God with a proper and suitable frame and temper of mind, and so much the more, as we see the day, the day of death approaching, which will put a final end to all our worship upon earth, on the due improve∣ment of which depends our worshipping with the church triumphant in Heaven. Beside—what great en∣couragement does the promise in our text afford us to meet in the name of our adorable Redeemer, when he tells us, where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. He is graci∣ously present with his faithful worshippers to quicken and enliven their devotion; then with joy they draw wa∣ter out of the wells of salvation, their language is, <Q>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so longeth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when shall I come and ap∣pear
<PB N="15" REF="012034_0014_0F8971B1B5FD80B0"/>
before God? O how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts, my soul longeth, yea even faint∣eth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God, blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they will be still praising thee, they go from strength to strength, every one of them in <HI>Zion</HI> appeareth before God. A day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door∣keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. O Lord of Hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</Q>—This is the heart and language of spiritual worshippers.—Such as wor∣ship God in spirit and in truth have a joy in God through our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> a joy that a stranger to these blessings intermeddleth not with. They have a peace which the world cannot give, and, glory be to God, a peace which the world cannot take away. It is their Heaven upon earth to enjoy communion and fellowship with the Father of their spirits in his sanctuary. It is Heaven begun in their soul, when, with the eye of faith, they see him, who is invisible, presiding in their worshipping assemblies; when <HI>Jesus</HI> is present with them by his spirit, and the spirit of God witnesseth with their spirits that they are his children, they then renew their strength by waiting upon the Lord, they mount up with wings as eagles, they run and are not weary, they walk and are not faint. They anticipate the joys of the blessed, and have a foretaste in earnest of that happiness they will enjoy when they shall join the hea∣venly host and sing the song of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Lamb forever and ever.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said I infer, that, as it is our duty to attend on publick worship, and God has been graciously pleased to condescend to encourage us there∣to, by promising to be with us to bless us, we ought to embrace every opportunity afforded us for this sa∣cred
<PB N="16" REF="012034_0015_0F8971B27459EE88"/>
service, not in a formal and customary manner, but with a due and becoming reverence, under a just sense of our unworthiness, and of the goodness and mercy of God, in permitting us, who are but vile earth and miserable sinners, to approach his presence. We should take the advice of <HI>Solomon,</HI> <Q>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they consider not that they do evil.</Q> <HI>Keep your feet when you go to the house of God,</HI> approach his courts with a becoming awe and reverence, enter into his pre∣sence with due veneration, with a prepared heart and attentive year, and <HI>be more ready to hear,</HI> that you may receive benefit thereby, <HI>than to give the sacrifice of fools,</HI> than to offer unto God the sacrifice of the wicked, (who are the greatest of all fools) which is an abomination unto him, for <HI>they consider not</HI> they rush into his pre∣sence, as the horse into the battle, without any thought of the importance of the work they are to be employed about; <HI>they consider not,</HI> that, when they pretend to be worshipping God, they are even then among the num∣ber of the profaners of his name, whom he has posi∣tively declared he will not hold guiltless; <HI>they consider not</HI> that they do evil in the very action, and at the very time, when they are foolish enough to imagine they are doing good, even then they are guilty of the most abo∣minable hypocrisy. They draw near to God with their mouths when their hearts are far from him. What can be a more solemn mockery of the great God than to offer to him the labour of the lip, when the thoughts are like the fool's eyes in the ends of the earth. My son, says God, give me thy heart, the whole heart, or else thy sacrifice is nothing worth. If the heart is not engaged in his service it is of no avail. Sincerity in his worship is what God looks at and is well-pleasing in his sight, when we desire acceptance only in <HI>Jesus</HI> the be∣loved. Sincerity is gospel perfection; therefore see
<PB N="17" REF="012034_0016_0F8971B335E0FFD0"/>
that you be sincere in all your addresses at the throne of grace; be in earnest; let your whole heart and all your affections be seriously engaged when you attend ordinan∣ces, and then you will be accepted. God will be found of you, if you seek him aright, and <HI>your heart,</HI> and the hearts of all shall rejoice that seek the Lord in sincerity.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as our Lord has promised to be mercifully present where two or three are gathered together in his name, it is by no means improper to erect and raise suitable and decent buildings to be set apart peculiarly for his service, not that there is any intrinsick holiness in the buildings, they are only relatively holy, so far as they are made use of for God's worship. It is not the walls that constitute the church, however beautiful the structure, however highly ornamented, and richly deco∣rated. The church, according to our 19th article, is defined to be a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God is preached, and the sa∣craments duly administered according to <HI>Christ</HI>'s ordi∣nance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same, and in our communion service, the blessed company of all faithful people, every member incorpo∣rate in the mystical body of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> heirs through hope of God's everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion of his dear Son, are considered in holy fellowship.</P>
<P>LASTLY, as we are this day met, and solemnly to o∣pen, by the word of God and prayer, this Chapel, for the worship and service of our great Creator,—O that he may make it such a place as he has chosen, may it be sanctified by his divine presence, whenever two or three, or a larger number, are gathered together here in his name, there may he be in the midst of them. O that it may never want a company of faithful people to assemble therein, and a faithful Minister to lead and as∣sist
<PB N="18" REF="012034_0017_0F8971B402B50228"/>
in their devotions; that God's pure word may be preached with abundant success; that sinners may be converted, the weak lambs of <HI>Christ</HI>'s flock strengthen∣ed and refreshed, and the strong edified and built up in the word and doctrine, that they may adorn the gospel of God their Saviour in all things. May the holy sa∣craments be duly administered in this place according to <HI>Christ</HI>'s ordinance, that all who are partakers thereof may receive, with the outward visible signs, the inward and spiritual grace, which may be to them certain sure witnesses of effectual signs of God's good-will towards them, and may work invisibly in them, and not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm their faith in him, that they, persevering and enduring to the end, may be saved with an eternal and everlasting salvation.</P>
<P>TO conclude,—let us one and all work while it is day, while the day of life lasts, for the night, the night of death cometh, when no man can work.</P>
<P>O SIRS, make it your chief study, your constant care and only aim, to seek the Lord while he is to be found, and call upon him while he is near; he is to be found now, to-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation. He is near to you in his ordinances, and if you call in earnest upon him, he will hear you, and give an answer of peace. Take heed that you do not despise his calls and neglect his invitations, lest he should swear in his wrath concerning you, they shall not enter into my rest. Remember, Sirs, time is short, death is certain, the hour of your departure very uncertain; an eternity of happiness or misery depends upon your improving or misimproving the few days al∣lotted you. There is no repentance in the grave, to which we are all hastening. As the tree falleth, so it must lie; as the day of death leaves you, the day of
<PB N="19" REF="012034_0018_0F8971B4B6CBAA08"/>
judgment will find you, and if you live and die in a state of sin, without repentance, there will be no escaping—everlasting punishment will be your just doom; tor∣ments, the most excruciating torments, will be your portion, without intermission, without end. O that I could persuade you to repent, and forsake your sins, that so your iniquities may not be your ruin, and return to the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> who is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and forgiveness of sins.—This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> came into the world to save sinners, the chief of sinners; if they will but truly repent them of their former sins, and stedfastly purpose, through the assistance of divine grace, to lead a new life, and have a lively faith in God's mercy through <HI>Christ,</HI> they shall be saved, saved from sin, from its guilt and dominion, saved from death and hell, saved with an everlasting sal∣vation.</P>
<P>O SIRS, be not faithless, but believing; may it be given you to believe on the only begotten Son of God, and believing, may you have life through his name.—As to you, who have obtained that precious gift of faith, through the righteousness of God and our Saviour <HI>Je∣sus Christ,</HI> and have received those exceeding great and precious promises, whereby you have been made parta∣kers of the divine nature, having escaped the corrup∣tion that is in the world through lust, give all diligence, and add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance pati∣ence, and to patience godliness, and to godliness bro∣therly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity;—for, if these things be in you and abound, they will make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Likewise, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for, if you do these things, you shall never fall; and so
<PB N="20" REF="012034_0019_0F8971B5740886B0"/>
an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> By thus acting, you will evidently demonstrate to the world that there is more in real religion than they are apt to imagine, and will clearly shew, in particular, that that grand and leading doctrine of justification by faith alone is not destructive of morality; but, that those who are born again from above are also created a∣new in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> unto good works, which God before ordained that men should walk in them, and though your whole dependance for justification in the sight of God is by faith in the death and sufferings, the life and obedience of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> yet you will be careful to main∣tain and practise <HI>all good works,</HI> every return and labour of love both to God and man, thereby justifying your faith, proving to the world, that it is true and genuine—hereby you will let your light shine before men, and they will see your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven: And by thus ordering your life and conversation aright, God will not only shew you, but make you happy partakers of his salvation.</P>

<P>O ETERNAL and Almighty God, we desire to praise and glorify thy holy name for this oppor∣tunity thou hast given us of assembling ourselves together in this place to dedicate and set it apart for thy worship and service, to hear thy word, and to offer up our prayers and praises unto thee, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our great Mediator. O that they may be heard and an∣swered,
<PB N="21" REF="012034_0020_0F8971B6FA9377D8"/>
and thy word, which I have now delivered, may be made effectual by thine almighty power of ac∣complishing thy divine will. Bless thy servant, but our Sovereign the King, and this his province: Bless all that bear rule and are in authority under him in it: Bless the Governor, his Council, the Assembly, the Magistrates and Ministers thereof, of every denomina∣tion; make them faithful instruments of promoting thy glory and the publick good: Bless this house and fami∣ly; grant, if it be thy will, that the pious intention of the Founder may be yet compleated, though thou hast seen fit to remove him hence before he had brought it to perfection: Bless all that are engaged in carrying it on, enable them to persevere and to be successful in all their undertakings: Bless the children, and all the instructi∣ons that from time to time are given them, impress them on their tender minds, and grant, gracious God, that they may not only be made useful members of the com∣munity, but may learn many profitable lessons of piety and virtue; that they may remember thee their Creator in the days of their youth, and that, being trained up in the way they should go, now while they are young, when they are old they may not depart from it: Bless, we beseech thee, all and each of us with what we stand in need of, either for this or a better world; let not this our meeting this day be altogether in vain; grant that we may not depart without thy heavenly benediction, and enable us to live the residue of our lives in thy fear and to thy honour and glory, that, when we depart hence, we may be translated into thy eternal and ever∣lasting kingdom.</P>

<P>MONDAY last being the Anniversary of laying the foundation of the Orphan-House, the new and very decent Chapel lately erected there was opened. On this solemnity his Excellency the Gover∣nor, many of the Gentlemen of the Council, and a very great number of the principal Inhabitants of the pro∣vince, were present. The company being seated in the Chapel, and the Orphan Children having sung a short hymn, the following Address was, with great propriety, and to the universal satisfaction of the audience, deli∣vered by PETER EDWARDS, one of the Orphans:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Excellency, Reverend Gentlemen, Gentlemen and Ladies,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to the commands of my superiors, and relying also on the candour, and benevolence of your Excellency and this polite and respectable company, I beg leave, with all humility, to make this publick ad∣dress.—It may not be improper to mention, that on this day, 32 years ago, the foundation of this house was laid by the Reverend Founder, whose death <HI>we Orphans in particular</HI> cannot sufficiently lament; that also on this day, two years past, your Excellency honoured this place with your presence, and condescended to lay the foundation of the two wings, superadded to the Or∣phan-House, for the accommodation of young Gentle∣men intended to be educated in Academical Learning, to enable them to move in a superior sphere of life; and
<PB N="23" REF="012034_0022_0F8971B874140BE8"/>
we are now met to open and solemnly dedicate this new and convenient Chapel to the service of our God and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>—The many and great advantages accruing from the establishment of publick schools in every government is obvious, and, in a young province as this is, it must be of the highest importance to its fu∣ture prosperity and welfare, which is the professed de∣sign of this charitable institution; an institution evident∣ly calculated to promote the happiness of society, by providing for, and instructing such poor children, as would otherwise, in all appearance, be brought up in ignorance, and become of little use and value to man∣kind.—They are <HI>here</HI> early taught their duty to God, their Country, and the respect they owe to those in au∣thority over them. God has various, and to us un∣thought of ways, which we poor short-sighted beings cannot fathom, to effect his purposes; but I hope I may be allowed to say, that, in all human probability, great might have been the blessing to this noble undertaking, had it pleased divine providence to have prolonged the valuable life of the deceased Founder—but he is now no more.—We have, however, no doubt of the great Fa∣ther of the fatherless supplying his loss; and that your Excellency, and all well-disposed persons, especially the good people of this province, will espouse our cause, and promote our welfare.—Agreeable to the plan of our deceased Benefactor, an Academy is now <HI>begun</HI> to be superadded to the Orphan-House, and Gentlemen of this province will have an opportunity of educating their sons under their immediate inspection, and will not be under the necessity of sending them at a great distance for that purpose, and be constantly labouring under the painful anxiety of knowing of their health and welfare, besides being probably at a greater and more uncertain expence.</P>
<P>THE utility of this, it's humbly presumed, wants no
<PB N="24" REF="012034_0023_0F8971B9342FB208"/>
recommendation; it is natural to love the place where we received our education, and passed our first years.—If parents would therefore have the pleasure of seing the daily progress their children make in knowledge; if they desire they should love and revere them, and have a peculiar regard for the place of their nativity; if they would preserve them from the improper liberties, they may take, when removed from their authority; it surely must be most eligible to let them spend their early years under the shadow of their wings, and within the reach of their parental admonitions.</P>

<P>I HAVE now in charge to return your Excellency, with all deference and humility, our most grateful acknow∣ledgments for your kind patronage and countenance, and to assure your Excellency, that we do, and will constantly pray for your happiness, wherever providence may please to place you, unfeignedly wishing, that your Excellency may continually experience that heart-felt satisfaction which can only dwell in the breast of the hu∣mane and benevolent, and we are persuaded, when you return to your native country, our cause will not be for∣got by your Excellency.</P>

<P>WE cannot, we must not, Sir, omit to give our pub∣lick testimony of your unwearied diligence and attenti∣on to cultivate and improve our minds in solid learning and useful knowledge, and, Gentlemen, it would be unjust, if we did not make the same acknowledgment for your constant care to make our situation in regard to our bodies easy, comfortable, and every way conveni∣ent, and as we have nothing to repay you, but our pray∣ers for your welfare, both in time and eternity, and our best thanks, we hope you will kindly accept this tribute of our grateful hearts.</P>

<P>YOU are happy in having parents, who have both in∣clination and means to pay for your education.—I have none.—But to you, Gentlemen, I must own my obli∣gation for having the opportunity of an education I could not, from my situation, have expected, had not your parents enabled our worthy Executor to employ so able a Tutor, as we now have, to instruct us, and I hope we shall shew, that his assiduity, care and pains, will have the desired effect.</P>

<P>WHAT shall I say to excite your gratitude?—I hope the memory of our late Benefactor, who has laboured incessantly for me, for you, and many others, who have partook of the benefit of this institution, since its first foundation, will be deeply engraven in our hearts, and
<PB N="26" REF="012034_0025_0F8971BAB445CE30"/>
remembered with the greatest reverence and gratitude.—This is all we have in our power, in return for such unmerited favours, and if this, our small tribute, should be wanting, we must, we shall be justly deemed the most ungrateful to our deceased Benefactor, who encountered innumerable, uncommon, and unknown difficulties, in carrying on this institution, notwithstanding he was maligned, traduced, and persecuted, with unrelenting virulence, as a cheat, an impostor, a publick robber, who, under the specious pretence of promoting a cha∣ritable design, was amassing great wealth to himself, all which he bore with an uncommon degree of pati∣ence.—Let me add, that God has been graciously pleas∣ed to provide for you, for me, beyond many, very ma∣ny in our circumstances.—We are <HI>here</HI> daily taught the great and fundamental truths of the gospel of the Son of God, have plenty of the necessaries of life, and are carefully educated to qualify us to get a comfortable subsistence, and make us useful members of society.—Let us therefore make a proper improvement of these mercies, and let us, my dear fellow Orphans, be thank∣ful to God, the Father of all, for them, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to his service, and by walking before him in holiness and righ∣teousness all our days, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord.</P>

the young Gentlemen of the Academy repeated se∣veral passages taken from some of the most approved English authors in such a manner as appeared agreeably to engage the attention and to meet with the entire ap∣probation of the company. Then Mr. <HI>Edward Lang∣worthy,</HI> their Tutor, addressed the company as follows:</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Excellency, Gentlemen and Ladies,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING observed the attention of your Excellency to the exercises of this morning, and the marks of plea∣sure and approbation so visible in all the Gentlemen and Ladies now present, I think it my duty, with the warm∣est gratitude, to acknowledge the honour your Excel∣lency and this respectable audience have conferred on this institution.—The young Gentlemen that just now spoke before your Excellency have not been long under my tuition; they are <HI>indeed young</HI>—and scarce initiated in the first principles of Literature; however, I flatter myself that these feeble attempts will be favourably re∣ceived, and that hereafter they will be enabled to exhi∣bit something more worthy of your attention and ap∣probation.</P>
<P>IT affords me the highest satisfaction, when I reflect, that divine providence hath honoured me with the care and direction of them, and I cannot but make a tender of my sincere and best respects to you, our worthy Ex∣ecutor, and to their worthy parents and friends, for the great confidence reposed in me.—Duly sensible of the important trust committed to every preceptor, I shall, in the fear of God, do my utmost to form their tender minds, and to impress on them such principles as may tend to advance their happiness in private, as well as in publick life: And I hope, from their proficiency, the Gentlemen of this province will be induced to promote
<PB N="28" REF="012034_0027_0F8971BC36C49970"/>
with all their influence the growth and prosperity of our present undertaking.</P>
<P>THE strict and virtuous education of youth is a point of great consequence in every country, and those that are employed therein do certainly merit the attention and encouragement of the publick in proportion to their faithfulness; for my part, I do most chearfully dedicate my whole time to this laborious work, and am deter∣mined to pursue it with the greatest assiduity and dili∣gence, being convinced that I can in no other way do more good to the true interest of my fellow beings, or do more service to the province.</P>
<P>IT is undoubtedly the indispensible obligation of e∣very one entrusted with the business of education to sa∣tisfy the publick with respect to their abilities and inten∣tions, and therefore I hope to convince you that no pains will be spared, no time lost, that whatever is use∣ful in the sciences, or ornamental in life, will <HI>here</HI> be inculcated both by precept and example.—Authors in the several branches of knowledge will be regularly read, and the sacred scriptures constantly explained:—These can bestow understanding upon all men; they are the universal logick, since none can read them without ei∣ther acquiring a greater exactness of thought, or being invited to contract a greater rectitude of manners.</P>
<P>OUR time being so far elapsed, permit me, in the be∣half of these poor Orphans, and in the name of every member concerned in this Seminary, most heartily to thank your Excellency, and all the Gentlemen and La∣dies now before me, for their kind attendance on this solemnity. With sentiments of the most unfeigned gra∣titude we would express our sense of it, and hope for the continuance of their esteem and friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="012034_0028_0F8971BCF5D15030"/>
AND I should be greatly wanting in respect and duty to you, Reverend Sir, and indeed justly incur the dis∣pleasure of all concerned in the management of this in∣stitution, if I did not now embrace the opportunity of returning you their and my humblest thanks for your kind and friendly assistance.</P>
<P>MAY what you and others have done on this Anni∣versary terminate in the glory of the great Head of the Church, who is God over all blessed for evermore.</P>

<P>A COPY of the late Reverend Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD's WILL having been pu∣blished in <HI>London</HI> by the Executors there, with the following Introduction, and its coming to Hand before the foregoing Sheets were fully com∣pleated, it is thought not improper to add it, with a Copy of the Will, as a further APPENDIX.</P>

<P><HI>AS we make no doubt the numerous friends of the late Re∣verend Mr.</HI> George Whitefield <HI>will be glad to see a ge∣nuine Copy of his Last-Will and Testament, his Executors have favoured us with a Copy of the same, transmitted to them from</HI> Georgia, <HI>and which they have proved in the Prerogative Court of</HI> Canterbury. <HI>And as it was Mr.</HI> Whitefield'<HI>s constant declaration he never meant to raise either a Purse or a Party, it is to be remarked, that almost the whole money he died possessed of came to him within two or three years of his death in the following manner,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Mrs.</HI> Thomson <HI>of</HI> Towerhill <HI>bequeathed him</HI> 500l. <HI>By the death of his Wife, including a bond of</HI> 300l. <HI>he got</HI> 700l. <HI>Mr.</HI> Whitemore <HI>bequeathed him</HI> 100l. <HI>and Mr.</HI> Winder 100l. <HI>And it is highly probable that, had he lived to reach</HI> Georgia <HI>from his late Nor∣thern tour, he would have much lessened the above sums, by disposing of them in the same noble and disinterested manner that all the publick or private sums he has been intrusted with have been.</HI></P>
