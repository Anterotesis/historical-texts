</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Jewish captivity in Babylon, and their return from it, is frequently mentioned in the sacred writings: the prophets who lived before this memorable event, had a single eye to it in their prophesies, fore-telling it as the just and righteous punishment of Jerusalem's idolatry, vile ingratitude, &amp; incorrigible wicked∣ness. But the three last of the prophets lived and prophesied, after the return from Babylonish captivity. <Q>Haggai, and Zachariah, appeared much about the same time: and it was some time after the return from captivity, when the building of the temple was both retarded by <HI>its enemies,</HI> and neglected by its friends.</Q> Then the prophets, Haggai the
<PB N="4" REF="012464_0003_0F89C9D70C688380"/>
prophet, and Zachariah the son of Iddo, prophe∣sied unto the Jews that were in Jerusalem, in the <HI>name of the God of Israel:</HI> to reprove them for their coldness and indifferency, respecting the worship of God, and for their carelesness, and remisness, in letting the house of God lie waste: and to encourage, and animate, and quicken them to revive the good work of build∣ing the temple, which had now been neglected for some considerable time, and to go on with it with vigour and resolution, notwithstanding any opposition, they had or should meet with in this noble and important undertaking. And among other things that the prophet Haggai mentions, by God's direction, to encourage and animate the people to go on, with the laudable work of building the second temple, this is one mention∣ed in the text, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>that the glory of this latter house should be greater than of the former.</Q> The house here referred to, is the second temple at Jerusalem, whose glory should excel that of the first temple. The first temple was built by king Solomon, by the express direction of God himself, for the honour of his adorable name, for his worship and service, near five hundred years before this second: and it was, no doubt, the most curious structure, the most magnificent, rich and costly building, the sun had ever shined upon. Which temple, after it was compleated, was by king Solomon piously dedicated to God, for sacred use, in religious worship and service, an account of which solemn dedication, is re∣corded
<PB N="5" REF="012464_0004_0F89C9D85A299220"/>
in the first book of Kings, chapter viii, which temple, for the sins of the people, the prevalence of their idolatry, their notorious in∣gratitude and awful rebellion against God, was ruined by fire. Jerusalem was destroyed, the walls broken down, and the temple burnt, by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, about four hundred years after it was built, and Zedekiah their wicked king, with his chiefs, and subjects in general, were carried captives to Babylon,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the account 2 Kings, xxv chapter.</NOTE> where they were enslaved and cruelly treated, and, where those that hated them, bare rule over them. Now after they had endured the miseries of captivity, for the space of seventy years for their sins, God who is merciful and invariably true to his word, remembered his covenant, and raised Cyrus to the throne, according to his word; who, as soon as he was master of the kingdom of Babylon, releases all God's visible people from captivity, issues a royal and gracious proclamation, granting them full liberty to re∣turn to their own land, with orders and assistance to build the house of God in Jerusalem. See Ezra first chapter. At this proclamation mul∣titudes of the captivated Jews return to their own land, who soon engaged in the laudable work of building the house of God. But alas! their hearts soon grew faint, through the oppo∣sition they met with, which was strong, and the work ceased for some time, through the crafty opposition of their enemies, and through the
<PB N="6" REF="012464_0005_0F89C9D905A8CE88"/>
coldness of some, and through the cowardice and covetousness of others among the Jews. Hag∣gai was the first prophet, that appeared in the name of the Lord of hosts, to arouse this people to a sense of their duty, to reprove them for their remisness and ingratitude, in letting the house of God lie waste, and to exhort and en∣courage Zerubbabel the governor, and Joshua the high-priest, and the rest of the people, to re∣store the worship, and rebuild the temple of God, which had been long neglected. Now God in zeal for his own glory, and in mercy to his people, sent his servant Haggai to awaken and quicken them to their duty, i. e. to build the temple and restore the pure worship of God. The neglect of which was their sin and their shame, and the procuring cause of these calami∣ties which they laboured under: they sowed much but gathered but little, they eat, but had not enough, they drank, but were not filled, they cloathed themselves, but were not warm. The reason of this is assigned, 'tis because the house of God lay waste. But the inspired pro∣phet does implicitly let them know, that upon their going about this work, God would prosper them and bless them with great plenty. The people hearken to this moving message, and soon go to work on the Lord's house, and they are abundantly succeeded in their labour. After the foundation of the second temple was laid, and the house began to appear in view, some of the younger people who had never seen the former
<PB N="7" REF="012464_0006_0F89C9D9D74DD5E8"/>
temple were joyful: but the old men who had seen the first temple in its glory were sorrow∣ful, and even wept. The extraordinary things with which the first temple was honoured, and which were wanting in the second, no doubt was some cause of their grief, as well as that the structure was not so magnificent and noble. The things wanting, were such as these, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the ark of the covenant, the mercy-seat upon it, the shecinah, the urim and thummim, and the holy fire upon the altar. And moreover, this latter temple was not so large, so stately and magnifi∣cent, as that which Solomon built. And the antient men who were grieved, could remember the first temple, and the glory and splendor there∣of, and were sensible of the great disparity be∣tween this and that. They could remember the gold with which it was adorn'd and beauti∣fied, the stones with which it was embellished and decorated, and the magnificence of the porch and of the pillars. But though this house would not be so magnificent as the former, nor any ways equal it in visible splendor &amp; grandeur, yet God by the mouth of his prophet, encourages the people to go on cheerfully in the building of it—&amp; lets them know that the real glory of the latter house, should be greater than that of the former. He gives them to understand that they need not be solicitously concerned, that this house had not so much silver and gold about it as So∣lomon's temple had, for says the great Lord of the universe, <Q>the gold is mine and the silver is
<PB N="8" REF="012464_0007_0F89C9DA7AB1C1C0"/>
mine,</Q> context verse 8th. He comforts them with this, that although the outward ornaments of this house would not equal those of the for∣mer, yet still its real glory should be greater. "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former." This was not so in respect of outward glory, magnificence and splendor. This latter house was indeed beautiful, and we find one of the disciples of our Lord admiring the stones, and building of the temple, Mark xiii, 1. But it was nothing in comparison with the tem∣ple which king Solomon built, for visible splen∣dor, magnificence and ornaments. It what then did the glory of this latter temple excel that of the former? What made its glory greater?—Why it was the personal presence of Christ there, in the days of his humanity. Into this temple, the son of God when he became incarnate, was ear∣ly brought and presented to the Lord—here he attended at twelve years old, here he at that age, attentively heard the doctors, and asked them the most interesting and important questi∣ons, insomuch that all who heard him were a∣stonished at his understanding and answers. See Luke, ii chapter. Here also afterwards, he preached the glorious gospel, &amp; here he wrought miracles, which were a confirmation of his mis∣sion from the Father. In the latter temple, the Lord Jesus Christ made his personal appear∣ance in the days of his humanity. In the tem∣ple Jesus Christ was daily preached, and it was this made its glory greater than that of the for∣mer.
<PB N="9" REF="012464_0008_0F89C9DCEBEECBB0"/>
God by his prophet, encourages the peo∣ple to go on in the building of the temple, for says the high and holy <HI>One</HI> who inhabits the prai∣ses of Israel, I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the desire of all nations shall come: &amp; I will fill <HI>this</HI> house with glory. This is a plain prediction of the coming of Christ, who in the fulness of time, personally appeared in the house, and in reference to this, we are to understand the text. In which sense 'tis really true, the glory of the second temple was greater than the glory of the first. The former excelled in out∣ward glory and magnificence, but Christ him∣self was the glory of the latter. There the Son of God the Saviour of the world, was early presented, there he was acknowledged as God's anointed, as the light of the Gentiles, as the glory of Israel, by good old Simeon, who took him in his arms, and blessed God that his eyes had seen his salvation, and was then ready to depart in peace. Where Christ is, there is glory indeed. His presence renders a house of worship more glorious, than any outward orna∣ments and adornings whatever. From the text thus explained, we may raise this general</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION. To enjoy the presence of Christ in his house of wor∣ship, is truly its greatest glory, and this is what a people ought most earnestly to desire and seek after.</HEAD>
<P>In illustrating this general observation, I shall pursue the following method, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012464_0009_0F89C9DEAAA2F678"/>
I. I shall attempt to shew when a people may be said to enjoy the presence of Christ in his house of worship.</P>
<P>II. What a people must do, in order to enjoy the presence of Christ in his house.</P>
<P>III. Why a people ought most earnestly to desire, and seek after the presence of Christ in his house of worship.</P>
<P>IV. That the presence of Christ in his house of worship, is truly its greatest glory.</P>
<P>I. My business, according to the method pro∣posed, is to shew when a people may be said, to have the presence of Christ with them, in his house of worship.</P>
<P>We are not now to expect the personal pre∣sence of the Son of God, in our worshipping as∣semblies, as it was enjoyed in the days of his incarnation, and while he abode here on earth. It is his spiritual presence only, that we are to expect to enjoy: this is what we are to seek and pray for, as what is most desirable. And there is no doubt at all, but that Christ is fre∣quently present in his worshiping assemblies here on earth, by the kind influences and teachings of his spirit, making the institutions of his wor∣ship, means of awakening sinners, of edifying the children of God, and thus owning and bles∣sing his people. And in general, a people may be said to have the presence of Christ with them, in his house of worship, when he owns the pub∣lic ordinances, and makes them means of spi∣ritual good, to precious and immortal souls. But to be particular.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="012464_0010_0F89C9DF33D8BC50"/>
1. When a people have a spirit of prayer and supplication, in Christ's house of prayer, then they may be said to enjoy his presence. A real spirit of prayer, is from the great author and fi∣nisher of faith, when a people have a right sense of their dependance upon God, for all mercies, spiritual and temporal, and come to God in prayer, believing that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, when they approach to God, sensible of their own nothingness, and place their dependance, on the merits and in∣tercession of the Lord Jesus Christ, for audience with the Father, and make mention of his righ∣teousness, and his only, when they sincerely la∣ment their sins before God, judging and con∣demning themselves, as guilty, unworthy crea∣tures, who have sinned against God, and have forfeited all title to his favour, when they sin∣cerely implore the pardon, and forgiveness of their sins, for the great Mediator's sake, when they offer up their sincere desires to God, in the name of Christ, they may be said to have the spi∣rit of prayer, and the Lord Jesus Christ is spiritu∣ally present with them, present with them by his spirit, who is then helping their infirmities, with groans which cannot <HI>be uttered,</HI> as the apostle expresses it. Rom. viii, 26. Likewise the spirit also, helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the spirit itself, maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. 'Tis not so much the florid expressions, 'tis not so much
<PB N="12" REF="012464_0011_0F89C9E1AC079B40"/>
the rhetorick and eloquence of our prayers, as the faith, sincerity and fervency of them, that the spirit as intercessor and helper works in us. 'Tis likewise said, Zach. xii, 10. <Q>And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of supplication, and they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in biterness for him, as one that is in bitterness, for his first born.</Q> Thus when Christ pours out a spirit of prayer and of supplication upon a people, it may be said, he is spiritually present with them, he is then with them by his spirit, and all the teachings, and all the influences of the divine spirit, come to us, as the fruits of the Redeemers purchase.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Jesus Christ is spiritually pre∣sent with his people in his house of worship, when a preached gospel is there made truly pro∣fitable to the souls of men; when 'tis made a means of convincing and converting sinners. The preaching of the gospel is a mean of grace, which Christ has instituted, for the spiritual good and benefit of precious and immortal souls. Ministers of the gospel of Jesus, are his ambas∣sadors, sent forth in his name to persuade, and beseech them to be reconciled unto God. And the plain persuasive preaching of the glorious gospel, is a mean of grace, which the spirit of God often makes use of, for the conviction of sinners, for the awakening of them, and of rous∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="012464_0012_0F89C9E2044BBF28"/>
them, out of their carnal ease and securi∣ty, a means of bringing them to serious consi∣deration, and to inquire in earnest, what they shall do to be saved: like Peter's hearers, who were pricked in their hearts, and solicitously in∣quire what they shall do. Acts ii, 37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? So the preaching of the gospel, is often made a means of the sinners conversion. 1 Cor. i, 21. For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world∣by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that be∣lieve. But true it is, that preaching will never be to any saving purpose, unless the spirit of Christ accompanies it to the hearts of men, and makes it a mean of their spiritual good. Paul may plant, and Appollos water, but it is God that gives the increase.</P>
<P><Q>If ministers had the tongues of angels, they could not of themselves prevail with sin∣ners, to believe and obey the gospel; 'tis the office of the spirit, to awaken the conscience, and∣to dispose the several faculties of the soul, to a chearful compliance, with their best in∣terests.</Q></P>
<P>When a preached gospel is set home with power, upon the hearts of sinners, by the agency of the divine spirit, and made a mean of their awakening, and of their solicitously inquiring what they shall do to be saved, when tis made a
<PB N="14" REF="012464_0013_0F89C9E450880288"/>
mean of their effectual turning, from the love and practice of sin, to the love and practice of holiness, in short, when men and women are new born in the house of God, as we are told it should be said of Zion. Psalm lxxxvii, 5.—And of Zion it shall be said, this and that man was born in her: when this is the case, it may well be said, the people enjoy the presence of Christ there, for certain it is, without his graci∣ous presence, no such mighty effects will ever take place. So when the children of God are edified by means of a preached gospel, when their graces are increased, their love inflamed, their faith strengthened, their zeal enlivened, and their principle of new obedience invigorat∣ed, then they enjoy the presence of Christ. These salutary effects, are owing to the spirits power∣fully impressing gospel truths upon their souls. And 'tis by means of the sincere milk of the word, that christians often grow in grace, in purity and holiness, it is hereby, that the saints are of∣ten edified and comforted. In the xcii Psalm towards the close, is clearly set forth, the great advantages arising to the godly, from their de∣vout and diligent attendance, upon the ordi∣nances of public and social worship, in such lan∣guage as this, <Q>The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age: they shall be fat and flourishing.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="012464_0014_0F89C9E51DCED048"/>
3. The Lord Jesus Christ is spiritually pre∣sent with his people in his house of worship, when his special ordinances administred there, are re∣ally beneficial to the souls of men. It is the divine blessing and teaching accompanying these, that renders them savingly beneficial to immor∣tal souls. Though baptism is to be administer∣ed but once, to one and the same person, yet when one who has been baptized himself, be∣holds this ordinance administered to others, it may be beneficial to him. And this it is, when it puts him in mind that he himself was once baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, whereby he was made a nominal christian, initiated into the vi∣sible church, and laid under a most solemn obli∣gation to be the Lord's disciple. It is benefici∣al when it is a mean of awakening people, to a heart-affecting sense of their defilement, and corruption by nature, and of engaging them to apply to the purifying blood of Jesus, for par∣don and for cleansing. It is beneficial, when it is a mean of quickening them to cry earnest∣ly unto God, to pour out his spirit upon them, to purge them from sin, and to cleanse and pu∣rify them. It is beneficial, when it is a mean of engaging those, who have had the Name of the Lord called upon them, afresh to give up selves to God the Father, as their God and fa∣ther, to the Son of God as their divine Redeem∣er, and almighty Saviour, and to the Holy Spi∣rit as their divine teacher, leader and sanctifier.
<PB N="16" REF="012464_0015_0F89C9E5CCFCEBB0"/>
And thus you see, we are not to be idle specta∣tors, when we behold the ordinance of baptism administered to others, we are to make a religi∣ous improvement of it, we are to look to God to make it profitable to our own souls. And when it is made a mean of spiritual good to precious and immortal souls, when many are thus quick∣ened, and benefited by it as we have heard, then the people may be said to enjoy the presence of Christ; when this ordinance publickly adminis∣tered in the sanctuary, has, through the blessing of heaven, such salutary effects as these upon the people, then the Son of God is spiritually present with them in his house of worship. So when the Lord's supper administered in his house, is a mean of promoting the spiritual good of those that partake of it, then they may be said to enjoy the presence of Christ with them in his house of worship. This ordinance is to be kept up in the church of Christ, and will be until his second coming. The design of this ordinance is to keep up in our souls, a lively, heart-affecting and soul profiting remembrance of the dying love of Jesus. 'Tis designed to be a public testimony, of our communion with the great head of the church. 1 Cor. 10, 16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the com∣munion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 'Tis designed to excite our love and gratitude to Jesus the prince of peace, who lov∣ed us, and gave his life a ransom for us. 'Tis
<PB N="17" REF="012464_0016_0F89C9E68132DAB0"/>
designed to excite our love and gratitude to Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who loved us, and gave his life a ransom for us. 'Tis designed as an indication of our communion with fellow Saints, and of our love and charity towards them. 'Tis designed to increase our faith, to enkindle our repentance, and to quicken and animate us, to new and holy obedience. And when 'tis a mean of promoting these gracious purposes, then do his people enjoy the presence of the glorious Redeemer with them. Yes, professing christians, when the Son of God meets you at his table, and there vouchsafes to admit you to communion with him, and when your souls are refreshed, quicken'd and edified, at his table, and your grace enliven'd, it may well be said, you enjoy the presence of Christ. The spiri∣tual presence of the Son of God at his table, is all that we are to expect or seek after: And we may not imagine, as the Papists do, that the bread and wine after they are consecrated, are changed into the real body and blood of Christ. His presence at his supper, has respect to our faith. He is not pre∣sent to them that do not behold him by faith, but only to them who fiducially behold his suf∣fering, through the elements, and such, and such only, have communion with him. And thus Christ is spiritually present with his people at his table, when the holy ordinance is thus made beneficial to the souls of men. And thus we see what it is to enjoy the spiritual presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, in his house of wor∣ship.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012464_0017_0F89C9E750A732E8"/>
II. <HI>I shall now attempt to shew, what a people must do, in order to enjoy the spiritual presence of Christ, in his house of worship.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, they can do nothing to merit this inestimable favour. But yet some duties are incumbent on them, the performance of which is the most probable way to have Christ, of his abundant grace and mercy, meet with them in his house, and own, and bless them there, and manifest himself unto them. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. In order to enjoy the spiritual presence of Jesus Christ in his house, the worshippers should see to it that they have love and charity for one another. If you come to the house of God with your hearts full of allowed mali<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> envy and hatred towards any of your fellow worship∣pers, you have no reason to think you shall en∣joy the presence of Christ; such disturbing pas∣sions of the soul, do mightily unfit for the so∣lemn service of the sanctuary, and especially that part of it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> public prayer, <HI>If you for∣give not men their trespasses,</HI> how can you expect <HI>your heavenly father will forgive you your trespasses?</HI> Not that barely our forgiving our fellow men any injuries they have done to us, entitles us to the forgiveness of the sins we have commit∣ted against God, but such is the constitution of the gospel, that while we are destitute of a forgiving temper towards our fellow men, it leaves us no grounds to expect forgiveness from God. No religious duty is acceptable to God
<PB N="19" REF="012464_0018_0F89C9E803DEB130"/>
without charity, God will not hear the prayers of those who cultivate in their hearts hatred, envy, ill-will and malice towards their fellow∣men. Mat. vi. 15. <HI>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither</HI> will <HI>your father forgive your trespasses. If thou remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee,</HI> faith our blessed Lord, <HI>leave thy gift before the altar—first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</HI> <Q>No endowments and qualifications of nature, no pretended zeal for the doctrines of religion, will attone for the want of charity and love.</Q> <HI>If we could speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, we are but like a sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal. Though we have the gift of prophesy, and understand all myste∣ry and all knowledge; and though we have faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not charity, we are nothing.</HI> Nay, <HI>tho' we bestow all our goods to feed the poor, and give our bodies to be burned, and have not charity, we are nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Would a people enjoy the presence of Christ in his house of worship, they must come up to worship in his temple with right views &amp; aims, &amp; those are, that they may truly glorify God, and receive spiritual peace and benefit to their own souls. God is infinitely the greatest, and infinitely the best of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gs and infinitely worthy of the highest praises of men and angels, it is therefore highly reasonable, that our high∣est aim should be his glory. Not that we worms of the dust can add any thing to the essential
<PB N="20" REF="012464_0019_0F89C9E8C2E47698"/>
glory of God, who is an all-perfect being, and the same yesterday, to day and forever. But by public worship, we acknowledge his glorious excellencies, we hereby own his being, his per∣fection, his glory and excellency, and do some∣thing to spread abroad, the glory and honour of his name—we hereby signify our belief, of our dependence upon God for all blessings spiritual and temporal. We hereby own our obligati∣ons to love and serve, and obey the great and eternal God. And God is pleased to account himself honoured, by the social worship of his people in the temple, when 'tis performed in spirit and truth. As the glory of God should be the chief view of our coming up to the house of the Lord for social worship, so our own spiritual good, may lawfully be our subordinate view. We should come up to the house of the Lord with fervent desires, that the Lord Jesus Christ would meet with us and bless us: that he would bless the provision of his house, to our spiritual good. God declared of old, that in all places where he should record his name, he would come unto them and bless them. The institutions of public worship, are designed for the good of souls, and no doubt, thousands and thousands have found saving benefit by them, and God is still able to make them beneficial to souls, for his hand is not shortned that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear. So that we may rightly have a subordinate view, to our own spiritual good, by coming up to the house of the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="012464_0020_0F89C9E9C01C7528"/>
3. Would a people enjoy the spiritual pre∣sence of Christ in his house, they must sincerely implore and ardently plead for it. All should in secret on the Lord's day, previous to their going up to the house of the Lord, ardently im∣plore the gracious presence of Jesus, that they and his worshiping assembly may be favoured with it that day. They should earnestly pray that Christ would meet with them▪ own and bless them. And his people in his house of prayer, should unitedly implore his gracious presence: the house of God, where his people meet together for solemn worship, is called the house of prayer. Mat. xxi, 13. This is the course a people must pursue, would they hopefully en∣joy the glorious presence of Christ with them, in his house of worship, would they have him meet them there and own and bless them.</P>
<P>III. <HI>I would in a few words attempt to shew, why a people ought most earnestly to desire the spiritu∣al presence of Christ in his house of worship. And the reasons I shall offer are two.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Without the presence of Christ in his house, he is not truly honored there. The Lord of glory is no further honoured, by our coming up to his house for worship, than his presence is enjoyed there. We have heard what it is to enjoy the presence of Christ in the so∣lemn assembly, and this is enjoyed, when he owns the public ordinances, and makes them means of good to precious souls. When sin∣ners are convinced, when they are converted,
<PB N="22" REF="012464_0021_0F89C9EC325A55C8"/>
when saints are edified, when they have com∣munion with God and Christ. Now 'tis evi∣dent that the Lord Jesus is not honoured, when his presence in neither of these respects is en∣joyed, and 'tis but a dull, lifeless formal service at best, that is paid to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Without the presence of Christ in his house, our own souls are not truly profited, and we make no advance at all towards the heavenly world. If we enjoy nothing of the presence of Christ, we make no advance at all in religion: if the presence of Christ is not his house, no part of instituted worship will be of any saving good, to any soul. The preacher in this view, preaches in vain, no good will follow without the divine blessing. No good fruit will follow. Without the presence of Christ, sinners will not be really and truly convinced of their sin and danger, sinners will not be converted, neither will the children of God be edified and comfort∣ed, nor will immortal souls be savingly profited, and therefore you see a people ought most ear∣nestly to desire, and seek after the spiritual pre∣sence of Christ in his house of worship. Because without this, the Lord of glory is not truly ho∣noured, and because without this gracious pre∣sence of Christ, our own souls are not truly be∣nefited.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>The presence of Christ in his house of worship is truly its greatest glory.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, that the first temple, in itself con∣sidered, was much more splendid and magnifi∣cent
<PB N="23" REF="012464_0022_0F89C9ECF7B250E8"/>
than the second, it was adorned and beauti∣fied with gold, so as the latter was not. Yet the inspired writer tells us, the glory of the latter house should be the greatest; and why? Because the Son of God, the Prince of Peace, that glori∣ous and divine person, in the days of his huma∣nity, should make his appearance there. Con∣text vi vii verses. For thus, saith the Lord of hosts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land: and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, faith the Lord of hosts. The enemies of the Jews, no doubt, de∣rided them, reproached them, and cast contempt upon them, and upon the house they were build∣ing. But the prophet by God's direction, com∣forts them with these considerations, that the Lord would fill the house with glory, and that although this house had not so much silver and gold upon it as Solomon's temple had, yet still its glory should be greater. And why? Because the presence of Christ the glorious Redeemer, the Prince of Peace should be enjoyed there. What are outward ornaments, compared with the spiritual presence of the Redeemer? They are surely nothing in worth and excellency. What are large and spacious buildings? What is ele∣gant architecture? What are whited walls? What are paintings and carvings? Are the glo∣ry of these any thing, compared to the enjoy∣ment of the presence of the Son of God, the con∣solation
<PB N="24" REF="012464_0023_0F89C9EEEE69F158"/>
of Israel in his house? No, they are by no means to be compared with it for real worth and glory. The whole congregation may be stupid, unedified, unprofited, let the house itself be never so elegant and grand, outward orna∣ments add no power to divine institutions. But where the presence of Christ is enjoyed, some good is done to precious souls, they are con∣vinced, converted or edified, light and truth is enjoyed, and souls are help'd forward towards the new Jerusalem. So that 'tis plain this is greater, infinitely greater glory, than any exter∣nal glory of the house: I don't mean so much as to intimate, that people should not be solicit∣ous what kind of houses they build for public worship, these ought to be decent and elegant, and at least more magnificent than our common dwelling-houses. And when people are ambi∣tious in building such houses, ambitious accord∣ing to their abilities, to have them stately, mag∣nificent and ornamental, 'tis truly a laudale tem∣per. But it remains true still, that the presence of Christ in his house of worship, is really its greatest glory. The external glory of this house is vastly greater than the external glory of that which we have now left, and are probably no more publickly to worship in. Yet if less of the presence of Christ is enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be in a sense true, that the glory of that house is the greatest. But if more of the presence of Christ is ever enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be emphatically true,
<PB N="25" REF="012464_0024_0F89C9EF76C98728"/>
that the glory of this latter house is greater than that of the former. Nothing is so ornamental to the soul as grace is. The graces of the spirit implanted there, are its greatest beauty, inconceivably greater than natural endowments. So the greatest glory of the house appro∣priated to public worship, is the spiritual pre∣sence of Jesus there, his speaking peace there to his people. 'Tis this makes it a nursery for heaven.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to illustrate the general observation. What now remains is by way of</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. We may hence be led to admire the grace of Christ, that he will afford his presence to worshipping assemblies here below. It was ex∣ceeding great grace and condescention in the eternal Son of God, to take our nature upon him, and in this nature to visit this sinful and fallen world—to obey the law, and to submit to the ignominious death of the cross, that he might open a way for our return to God, of our enjoying peace with him, and of our being fi∣nally happy in his presence, in whose presence is fullness of joy. And 'tis grace in the Son of God, now he is ascended up on high, now he is exalted at the right hand of the Father, now he receives the praises of saints and angels in the heavenly world, to vouchsafe his spi∣ritual presence to worshipping assemblies in this
<PB N="26" REF="012464_0025_0F89C9F1689EAA98"/>
world. But though he is ascended on high, yet still he cares for the church on earth, he keeps it and waters it every moment. He of∣ten draws near to his people, when they essay to draw near to him in the solemn assembly, and owns them there, and meets them with a divine blessing, comes in and sups with them, and they with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. We hence see how cautious all should be, lest they do any thing that shall provoke the Son of God to deny his presence in his house of worship. We should beware we don't do this, by introducing any thing into his worship that he don't require, or that is contrary to his will. We are to adhere to the things which Christ has instituted. We should take heed that we don't provoke Christ to deny his presence, by coldness, indifferency and formality in his wor∣ship. We should take heed that we don't, by neglecting to implore, and earnestly seek his presence. We should beware we don't, by an uncharitable, unforgiving temper and disposi∣tion towards our fellow-worshippers. Let all take heed that they do nothing to provoke the Lord of glory to deny his spiritual presence in his house of worship. Remember without his presence, Christ is not truly honor'd, and your own souls are not truly bettered.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence see how ungrateful they are to Christ, and careless of their own souls, who neglect public worship. The worshipping as∣semblies
<PB N="27" REF="012464_0026_0F89C9F218768ED8"/>
are sadly negled by multitudes at this day. An evidence this, of the sad decay of godliness. Had persons a due sense of the im∣portance of this duty, had they but a right concern for their souls, had they but a right sense of the worth of them; they could not live in the neglect of this important duty, but would be swift to hear the gospel preached—'Tis owing to the singular blessing of heaven, that the gospel is put into our hands, which acquaints us with the great things of our peace, a blessing denied to multitudes, who are now perishing for lack of vision. 'Tis an illustri∣ous display of grace in the Prince of Peace, that he is sending his ambassadors, to beseech and persuade us to be reconciled unto God, and that we have a free and undisturbed access to the house of God. A preached gospel is de∣signed to do good to souls, and no doubt but thousands and thousands have been really and savingly benefited by it. Faith comes by hear∣ing, and hearing, by the word of God. How ungrateful then, are such to Christ, and care∣less of their own souls, who carelessly neglect the public worship of God? They pour con∣tempt upon Christ's own institution, and pro∣voke the Holy One, who is well acquainted with all their ways, to say concerning them, <HI>my spirit shall not strive with them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We may at this time reflect with grati∣tude, that the people in this land have been so spirited to build houses to worship God in, and
<PB N="28" REF="012464_0027_0F89C9F2774BF1E0"/>
that they have enjoyed so much of the presence of Christ. As the professed design of our fore∣fathers, in coming into this land, then a howl∣ing wilderness, was the more free enjoyment of religion, according to the dictates of their own consciences; so the form of religion has all along been kept up, and no doubt much of the presence of Christ has been enjoyed, much of the power of religion has been visible, and God has all along, from generation to generation, had a number that were a people for his praise. In this land, the gospel has been preached in the purity of it. The people from generation to generation, have been spirited to build de∣cent houses for public worship, spirited to sup∣port the gospel, and to keep up the worship of God.—This has been the case in ge∣neral, and especially in these New-England colonies.—And God has smiled upon worshipping assemblies from time to time, and no doubt bless'd the provision of his house, to thousands who are now rejoicing in glory; and bless'd it to the saving benefit of thousands who are now his obedient servants on earth, and are meetning and preparing for eternal glory.—These things call for a grateful remembrance. These things call for sincere and ardent gratitude to the great Father of Lights, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift. And in this view of the case, we may well say, <HI>The lines are fallen to us in a pleasant place.</HI></P>
<P>I would particularly address myself, in the
<PB N="29" REF="012464_0028_0F89C9F335D04A78"/>
next place, to the people of this church and con∣gregation.</P>
<P><HI>Dearly Beloved,</HI></P>
<P>It is both a joyful and solemn occasion we are this day met upon; no less than to dedicate and consecrate this house, erected for the pur∣pose of public worship, to the use and service of the great and eternal God, and likewise ar∣dently to implore his gracious acceptance of it, as a place where he will record his name, and where he will give peace. O! that every knee may bow in subjection to God, and every heart be devoutly engaged in a free surrender up of this house, to the use and service of the mighty God. And let every heart be engaged, in devout ejaculations to God, that he would gra∣ciously accept our offering, and that he would record his name here, and that in this place he would give peace.</P>
<P>You have reason, great reason to be thank∣ful to the great Father of Mercies, that you have deen prospered in your undertaking, and that your eyes this day behold such a stately building, now decently finished, and so well formed for the pious use to which it is designed. Let every heart be filled with gratitude to God, from whom all our temporal, as well as spiritu∣al blessings flow. And while you essay to dedi∣cate this house to God, remember of his own you offer. When pious David and his princes had offer'd vast sums for the service of the house of God, they freely acknowledge of his own
<PB N="30" REF="012464_0029_0F89C9F3F3C34FF0"/>
they had given him. 1 Chron. xxix. 14—16. <Q>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly, after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name, cometh of thine hand &amp; is all thine own.</Q> So∣lomon when he had finished the temple, made a free surrender of it up to God, and God testified his acceptance of it by a cloud's filling the house of the Lord. He approves of the building and finishing of the temple, as a service done to his great and glorious name, and to his kingdom among men. He also testified his acceptance of it, as a place where he would record his name, and where he would meet with his people and own and bless them, by the fire which came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt of∣fering and the sacrifices. Yea, God expresly tells king Solomon, he had heard his prayer, and that he had hallowed the house which he had built, to put his name there. And as you would have the mighty God accept of this house as his, as you would have him record his name here, as you would have him give peace in this place, then, from your hearts, make a free and cordial surrender up of this house to God, im∣plore his presence here, implore his acceptance of it, as a place where he will record his name. And having dedicated the house to God, beware you don't provoke him to forsake it, by forsak∣ing
<PB N="31" REF="012464_0030_0F89C9F4FAB53878"/>
of it yourselves. Beware you don't, by your coldness and indifferency, in the duties of the sanctuary when you do attend. Beware you don't, by trifling with the solemn means of grace. Beware you don't by censoriousness, by unchari∣tableness, and an unforgiving temper towards one another. You are sensible what long con∣tests and debates you have formerly had, about the place where to erect the house, and no doubt, as you have been of very opposite and different sentiments, so you have had hard thoughts of one-another, uncharitableness and censoriousness towards one-another, and no doubt, this differ∣ence in sentiments, has given rise to a sad decay of that brotherly love, which ought to subsist between members of the same society. Now, my advice to all is, to put away all bitterness, and wrath, and evil-speaking, and to put on bowels of love and charity towards one-another, and study to live in love and peace, that your prayers be not hindred. Don't pollute the wor∣ship here, by harbouring any envy or ill-will, towards any that you think have been too for∣ward, and too engaged to get the house erected where it now stands. On the other hand, don't pollute the worship here, by harbouring any un∣charitable disposition, towards those who you imagine have unreasonably opposed the erecting of the house in this place. And let all put on that charity which is the bond of perfectness, that charity which hopeth all things, which put∣teth the most favourable construction, upon the
<PB N="32" REF="012464_0031_0F89C9F5962D0C38"/>
words and actions of men. Here meet as bre∣thren who profess the same religion. Here meet as brethren who profess to worship the God of peace and order. Here meet as bre∣thren who profess to be seeking the same hea∣venly inheritance. Here strive together in prayer according to God's direction. Here unite in songs of praise, to him who inhabits the praises of Israel. You have been at much cost to erect and finish this house, and as you would now en∣joy the spiritual presence of Christ here, which is the greatest glory of the temple, which is the greatest glory of the inner temple, the soul of man, then let this be a house of prayer, and a house of praise. Here be swift to hear the word, and ready to receive instruction. Here attend with steadiness, with sincerity and devotion.—Keep your feet when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sa∣crifice of fools. Would you have God meet you here, and own and bless you? Then here seek his presence with earnestness and sincerity. Would you have the provision of the house bless'd to spiritual purposes? Then humbly and sincerely look to God for it. Be strict to adhere to the institutions of divine worship. The sanctity and purity of the church, and its strict adherence to divine institutions, is much more its glory and ornament, than external pomp and splendor. It is truly desirable to have the presence of Christ in this house of worship, to have him own and bless, to spiritual purposes, the provision of
<PB N="33" REF="012464_0032_0F89C9F769EA1E28"/>
his house, to have him pour out his spirit here, for the conviction and conversion of sinners, and for the edification and comfort of saints. Surely this is what we ought all of us to desire, this is what we ought earnestly to seek after, this more than any external pomp and splendor, is the true glory of the house. And notwithstanding this house vastly excels that which we have now left, (which has long been a house of wor∣ship) in outward splendor and magnificence, yet if more of the presence of Jesus is ever enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be emphatically true, that the glory of this latter house is the greatest. As sinners would be awakned and converted, and made partakers of a spiritual life, as saints would be edified and comforted, as they would increase in purity and holiness, then let them take heed, that they dont forsake the as∣sembling themselves together, for the purpose of social worship, as the manner of some is, but wait at wisdom's gates, and watch at the posts of her doors. In a word, <Q>would you grow in knowledge and grace? Would you be pre∣pared to worship with an innumerable com∣pany of angels, and in the general assembly of the first born above, than which no∣thing is more desirable? then with frequency and delight, repair to the tabernacle of God, the congregations of his people here on earth, for these are nurseries for heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>a few words of exhortation to the whole auditory conclude the present discourse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="012464_0033_0F89C9F7AF950F90"/>
You have heard how the presence of Christ adorns the temple, and this is the greatest orna∣ment the soul can have. The lovely graces of spirit, love, joy, peace, gentleness, meekness and temperance, do mightily embellish, and adorn the soul of man. 'Tis your highest interest and glory, to be like Christ in purity and holiness, and to be imitators of him, in meekness and lowliness of heart. It nearly concerns you to have interest in him, who saves his people from the second death, and to stand related to him as a Saviour and Redeemer, and as his loyal subjects and Servants. He is the way, the truth and the life: neither is there salvation in any other: our glory and happiness arises from our relation to Christ, our likeness to him, interest in him, and communion with him. The soul in which the Son of God has set up his kingdom, the soul in which he dwells by his spirit, the soul which he has adorn'd with the lovely train of christian graces, is more beautiful and glorious than ever Solomon's temple was, and will be so through the never ending ages of eternity. Let all then see to it, that they cordially receive Christ as their Lord and Saviour, that they bow the knee in subjection to him who is King in Zion, that they be his obedient subjects and servants, and that they worship the Lord with sincerity and pure devotion, in his temples here below, that so they may be prepared to worship in the temple above, which endures for ever and ever, than which nothing is more desirable.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="012464_0034_0F89C9F925E09820"/>
Now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great She∣pard of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you, that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever,</P>
