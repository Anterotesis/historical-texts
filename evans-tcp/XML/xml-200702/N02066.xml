<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE Way &amp; End of the Wicked. After the Execution of the Pirates. 29 d. V. m. 1723</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB XXII. 15.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Hast thou marked the Old Way, which Wicked Men have trodden?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT seems, there has in all Ages been such a <HI>Way.</HI> And the <HI>Way</HI> is in <HI>Ours</HI> as much <HI>trodden</HI> as ever. Yea, we have newly seen a formidable Exhibition of the <HI>Way,</HI> and of the End which the <HI>Way</HI> will bring unto. But there are things to be <HI>Mark∣ed</HI> in the <HI>Way.</HI> There are many <HI>Remarkables</HI> in the <HI>Way.</HI> It may be a thing of <HI>Good Conse∣quence,</HI> yea, tis a thing of the <HI>Last Importance,</HI> for us to take notice of them. We will this day <HI>Mark the Way that Wicked Men have trod∣den.</HI> And indeed; this will be one proof that we do not <HI>take</HI> the <HI>Way.</HI> To <HI>Mark</HI> the way which <HI>Wicked Men do take,</HI> is a <HI>Step</HI> which <HI>Wicked</HI> Men do not use to <HI>take.</HI> Tis a <HI>Step</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002451_0003_0FDB54BE6B938C50"/>
that would have a Tendency to bring them and keep them out of that <HI>way</HI> This made <HI>Eliphaz</HI> afraid that <HI>Job</HI> had fail'd in this point. He Feared, That <HI>Job</HI> had been tainted with this Impiety, To <HI>Forget</HI> that the Most High God, whose Throne is in the Heavens did <HI>mark the Ways</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> or take any cognisance of what they did in the world. This produced a Fear in him, That <HI>Job</HI> did not <HI>Mark the Ways of Wicked Men.</HI> For this <HI>Forgetfulness</HI> is one <HI>art</HI> and <HI>Cause</HI> of their <HI>wicked Ways</HI></P>
<P>But the DOCTRINE which I have now before me is this.</P>
<P>If we Mark the Ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men, which is indeed, an old Way, we shall find in it some things that are truly Remarkable.</P>
<P>It seems orderly &amp; requisite for u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in the first place to Satisfy a more <HI>General Enquiry;</HI> The <HI>Subject</HI> which our Discouse is anon more <HI>Particularly</HI> to insist upon, is first in a more <HI>General way</HI> to be Enquired after. <HI>What it the way of Wicked Men?</HI> I answer, you may be sure Tis a <HI>way of Wickedness;</HI> Tis a <HI>Wicked Way.</HI> Tis the <HI>Way that is not good.</HI> We read, Psal 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. 24. <HI>See if there be any wicked Way in me.</HI> We read, Prov 8. 13. <HI>I hate the Evil way.</HI> We read, Psal. 1. 6. <HI>The way of the ungodly shall perish.</HI> This is the <HI>Way trodden by wicked Men.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002451_0004_0FDB54C3349161D8"/>
But you have not yet a Sufficient Answer. The Question, <HI>what is the Way which Wicked Men have trodden?</HI> Will not be answered without some Account of the more <HI>Distin∣guishing Steps,</HI> which they take in their <HI>Way.</HI> Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w then. The <HI>Way of Wicked Men,</HI> lies both in <HI>Wicked Opinions</HI> &amp; in <HI>Wicked Practices.</HI> There are those <HI>Opinions,</HI> which are called, 2 Pet. 3. 17. <HI>The Error of the Wicked.</HI> False <HI>Opinions;</HI> Those <HI>Wrong Thoughts,</HI> which will hinder men from the <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of God, which He has made necessary for us. There are those <HI>Practices,</HI> which are called, 2 Pet 2. 2 <HI>Pernicious Ways.</HI> Vile <HI>Practices.</HI> The <HI>Ungod∣liness &amp; worldly Lusts,</HI> which are inconsistent with a <HI>Godly,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sober,</HI> &amp; <HI>Righteous</HI> Life in the World. Yet more particularly. The <HI>Way of Wicked Men,</HI> is to Forget <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>End</HI> for which God creates them and preserves them; the <HI>Errand</HI> which God sends them to appear among Mankind upon. Their <HI>Way</HI> is to feel no <HI>Want</HI> of, to see no worth in an admirable <HI>Saviour;</HI> to feel no Distress about an Interest in Him; to be careless whether they be ever Saved from their Sins, or no. Their <HI>Way</HI> is, to Propound an <HI>Happiness</HI> in the Enjoyment of <HI>this World,</HI> and be very Earnest, Vehement, Violent in Seeking after worldly possessions: Regardless of any <HI>Higher Portion.</HI> Their <HI>Way</HI> is, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>make Light of Sin;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="002451_0005_0FDB54C5DFB2AF60"/>
to Entertain <HI>Temptations</HI> to Sin with Easy Compliances; and to have but a short and small Regrett for it, when they have Sinned. I will give you a true <HI>Survey and Report of the Road;</HI> The <HI>Way</HI> which Wicked Men have trodden, is thus described; Eph. 2 2. 3. <HI>Ye walked according to the course of this World, ac∣cording to the prince of the power of the Air, in the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts of the Flesh, fulfilling the Desires of the Flesh and of the Mind.</HI> Finally, There is no need of my Travelling a great way from my Text, that I may point out unto you, <HI>the Way that Wicked Men have trodden.</HI> Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k back no more than Two Verses, and you will see; Their <HI>Way</HI> is this: <HI>Thou say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, How doth God know!</HI> Tis to be insensible, that they have the <HI>Eye of God</HI> upon them in their <HI>Way.</HI> Tis to be unmindful, that <HI>God is acquainted with all their Ways;</HI> knows every <HI>Word</HI> uttered by their Tongues; knows their very <HI>Thoughts</HI> afar off Tis to act, as not Expecting that God will ever call them to any <HI>Account</HI> of what they have done in their Lives. This is their <HI>Way</HI> And, <HI>My Friend,</HI> If this be thy <HI>Way,</HI> then thou art in the <HI>Way that Wicked Men have trodden. Wo</HI> to thee, Thou art one of them. Of every one who makes this his <HI>Way,</HI> I must faithfully tell you, in such Terms as those; Job 34 8 <HI>He goeth in company with the workers of Iniquity, he walketh with wicked men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002451_0006_0FDB54C771F85008"/>
We are now ready to proceed upon our more <HI>Special Enquiries.</HI> And these will be no more than <HI>Two.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What</HI> is there to be <HI>Marked</HI> in the <HI>Way that Wicked Men have trodden;</HI> or, what shall we find <HI>Remarkable</HI> in the <HI>Way of wicked Men!</HI> Many <HI>Remarks</HI> are to be made upon it. I will Single out a few, that will be as Useful, as they are Obvious.</P>
<P>First. We may <HI>Mark</HI> this in the <HI>Way that Wicked Men have trodden;</HI> Tis an <HI>old Way.</HI> It is a just observation, which a famous &amp; an accute <HI>Scotch</HI> Expositor has upon my Text; That <HI>Sin is a very Old Trade in the World.</HI> We read, Joh. 8. 44 It was <HI>from the Beginning.</HI> Sin was committed in the very <HI>Beginning</HI> of the World. The World had not been begun long before the <HI>Way of Sin</HI> was taken up. Tis true, the <HI>Way of Sin</HI> is not so old, as the <HI>Way of Truth</HI> Our Excellent <HI>Caryl</HI> has well Ex∣pressed it; <Q>Tho' man <HI>quickly</HI> went <HI>out of the Way,</HI> surely, his <HI>First step</HI> was not <HI>out of the Way.</HI> He <HI>went Right</HI> before he <HI>went Wrong;</HI> he <HI>stood</HI> before he <HI>fell.</HI></Q> But then, the way of Sin is very <HI>old.</HI> In the <HI>Sinful ways</HI> of men, to seek after a Felicity in things under the Sun, here tis that it has been said, <HI>There is no New Thing under the Sun.</HI> Tis no <HI>New Thing</HI> for men to Sin against God. And tho' men are <HI>Inventers of Evil Things,</HI> yet there is rarely
<PB N="6" REF="002451_0007_0FDB54CB9998BFE8"/>
any sort of Sin committed in <HI>our days,</HI> but what was committed in the <HI>Days of old.</HI> In∣deed, we read, Jer. 6. 16 <HI>Ask for the old pathes, where is the Good way, and walk therein.</HI> There is a <HI>Good old Way.</HI> And it is the <HI>oldest Way.</HI> The <HI>Greatest Antiquity</HI> is to be pleaded for that <HI>Way.</HI> But then, there is an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll way,</HI> that is also an <HI>old Way.</HI> The <HI>Way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin,</HI> is a very <HI>beaten Way</HI> It was <HI>trodden,</HI> as here we find in the <HI>Old World,</HI> and long before the <HI>Flood.</HI> It was that <HI>Way,</HI> that the <HI>Flood</HI> rushed in upon the world. One gives this Paraphrase on my Text. <HI>Hast thou marked the Way of the old World?</HI> An <HI>Old Way;</HI> Very near, very near, as old as the World. The very <HI>first man,</HI> that was born into the World, proved a <HI>wicked man.</HI> Of Wicked men in our Days, We read, Jud. 11. <HI>They have gone in the way of Cain.</HI> The <HI>Nature</HI> of Man was <HI>betimes</HI> depraved with corruption. Ah, Mankind, How <HI>Early didst thou rise, &amp; corrupt all thy Doings?</HI> Men have <HI>naturally</HI> taken the way of Sin, ever since our <HI>First Fall</HI> from God. And, how <HI>Quickly</HI> did we fall! <HI>Man in Honour, How few Nights didst thou continue so?</HI> The <HI>Way of Sin</HI> is more than five Thousand and seven Hundred Years old. It is no Apology <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or an <HI>Evil thing;</HI> Tis <HI>no more than what others have done before me.</HI> The <HI>via trita,</HI> is not always <HI>via tuta.</HI> It may be an <HI>old Way,</HI> and yet not a <HI>safe Way.</HI> It may be
<PB N="7" REF="002451_0008_0FDB54CE43316200"/>
an <HI>old Way,</HI> and yet be the <HI>Way that Wicked men have trodden. Sinners,</HI> what undesireable Company, will you find there, if by <HI>Wandring from the way of understanding,</HI> you go down to the <HI>Congregation of the Dead.</HI> You are going in the <HI>Old Way,</HI> &amp; the Sinners who trod that way in <HI>old Time,</HI> will be your Companions, in the <HI>End</HI> of the way. You will have your Souls gathered with <HI>Cain,</HI> and the Monsters of the <HI>old World;</HI> with the <HI>Sodomites,</HI> &amp; with <HI>Achithophel,</HI> and with <HI>Judas,</HI> and with the Wretches that a <HI>Great while ago,</HI> walked in that way of Sin that you have chosen. Oh! poor Comfort, in having such <HI>Fellow-Suf∣ferers!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. We may <HI>Mark</HI> this, in the <HI>Way that wicked men have trodden;</HI> Tis an <HI>Hard Way;</HI> a way full of <HI>Trouble.</HI> We read, Prov. 13 15. <HI>The way of Transgressors is hard.</HI> Tho' it be a <HI>Broad Way,</HI> yet it is a <HI>Rough</HI> One. A Very Troublesome way. The way lies all thro' the <HI>Valley of Achor</HI> What we render, <HI>A way of wickedness,</HI> is in the Hebrew Original, A <HI>way of Grief</HI> Tis a <HI>Grievous Way.</HI> A Wic∣ked man, <HI>His way is always Grievous.</HI> Of them that walk in this way, We read. Rom. 3. 17. <HI>The way of peace they have not known.</HI> In the <HI>way of Piety,</HI> there is a Glorious <HI>Peace</HI> to be Enjoy'd. <HI>Great peace have they that Love that Way;</HI> and if they were always in it, there
<PB N="8" REF="002451_0009_0FDB54CFAD69D2F0"/>
would be <HI>nothing to offend</HI> them: nothing but what they might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from it. There is a <HI>Peace</HI> belonging to them, who <HI>walk according</HI> to the <HI>Rule</HI> that lays out the way of God, &amp; of Holiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Mind, in a <HI>Faith</HI> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> &amp; Faithfulness, &amp; in an <HI>Assurance</HI> of the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Favour; A <HI>Calm</HI> within, whatever <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm</HI> there may be abroad. But, alas, <HI>There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Peace, saith my God unto the wicked.</HI> You may <HI>Mark</HI> this, Wicked men find their <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts</HI> perpetually Enslaving of them; their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> throwing them into perpetual Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rders; their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Justice of God, made their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; so there are <HI>many</HI> Sorrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>to the wicked.</HI> And you may <HI>Mark</HI> this, Wicked men carry about also a <HI>Guilty Conscience</HI> with them▪ a <HI>Conscience</HI> that keeps them in a continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siness; a <HI>Conscience</HI> continually Scourging of them, &amp; roaring in their Ears, <HI>The Great God will one day dreadfully Punish thee for these Miscarriages.</HI> Oh! Tis a <HI>Sad</HI> thing to walk in the <HI>way that wicked men have trodden. Mark</HI> it, Sirs; Tis a <HI>Walk</HI> in the <HI>Valley of the shadow of Death!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. We may <HI>Mark</HI> this in the <HI>way</HI> that <HI>wicked men have trodden,</HI> They are at more Pains in <HI>their</HI> way to <HI>Damn</HI> themselves, than G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly men are, in a <HI>better</HI> way to <HI>Save</HI> them∣selves. Wicked men take a great deal of <HI>Pains</HI> in their way; they find it a <HI>Laboriotes</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002451_0010_0FDB54D7641526F0"/>
Way. The very term for <HI>wickedness,</HI> in the Greek Language of the New Testament, im∣plies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in it. A Labour to hasten on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> With less <HI>Labour</HI> has many a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, laid h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld on Eternal Life. Of a wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we read, Psal. 7 14 <HI>Behold, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> iniquity.</HI> Ah, Silly Soul; With less <HI>Travail,</HI> &amp; less Anguish, many an one has been <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again,</HI> &amp; had the Image of a Glorious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in him. Indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is no get∣ting to Heaven with u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a taking of <HI>Pains</HI> for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. We are to <HI>Strive,</HI> that we may <HI>Enter the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;</HI> It requires <HI>Agonies</HI> to be an <HI>Over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> &amp; make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re of Heaven. But you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this: That many a Sinner is at more <HI>Pains,</HI> to plunge himself into the lowest <HI>Hell,</HI> than many a Saint is to secure a share in the Good Things of the <HI>Heavenly Places.</HI> He <HI>runs</HI> down to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mbers of Death,</HI> more eagerly, than any Christian <HI>runs</HI> in the <HI>Race which</HI> ends in the Heavenly Mansions. A wicked man does more to <HI>Please</HI> the <HI>Flesh,</HI> &amp; the <HI>World,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Devil,</HI> than a godly man does to <HI>Please God</HI> He serves the <HI>Destroyer</HI> with more In∣dustry, than one who yet finds Acceptance with Him, uses in serving the only <HI>Saviour.</HI> He is more Industrious to get himself put off with a <HI>Portion in this Life,</HI> than one who yet attains unto it, is to attain unto a <HI>better and lasting Substance in Heaven.</HI> He will waste his
<PB N="10" REF="002451_0011_0FDB54D8B6AAA4E8"/>
<HI>Estate,</HI> he will ruine his <HI>Health,</HI> he will ven∣ture his <HI>Life,</HI> &amp; all that he may be the sooner &amp; the deeper <HI>drowned</HI> in an horrible <HI>Perdition.</HI> Many an one, who never did so much for it, yet arrives unto the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> Of wicked men, we read, Jer. 9 5 <HI>They weary them∣selves to commit iniquity.</HI> You may <HI>Mark</HI> this; Many an one with a <HI>Patient continuance in</HI> well∣<HI>doing,</HI> arrives <HI>less-tired</HI> unto the Glory of Hea∣ven, than a wicked man arrives to a Lodging in the place of Dragons, which he has been all his Days working for. Oh! the <HI>Fully,</HI> Oh! the <HI>Madness,</HI> of wicked men! When they are in the <HI>Place of Torments,</HI> with what corroding Indignation will they look back upon it!</P>
<P>Fourthly. There is this to be <HI>Marked</HI> in the <HI>way that wicked men have trodden;</HI> Men are <HI>Deceived</HI> all the way; it is a very <HI>Deceitful</HI> way We read, Prov. 11. 18. <HI>The wicked worketh a deceitful work.</HI> A wicked man is drawn into his <HI>way,</HI> with many <HI>Promises</HI> which the <HI>Temp∣ters</HI> make unto him. The <HI>Promises deceive</HI> him; his Temptations have <HI>imposed</HI> upon him; he meets with <HI>Disappointments</HI> of all his Expecta∣tions. He <HI>Promised</HI> unto himself, such <HI>Satis∣factions</HI> as he never meets withal. He is <HI>Pro∣mised,</HI> that he shall find Contentment in his <HI>way;</HI> but his <HI>way</HI> never, never brings him to it. It is <HI>Promised</HI> unto him, That when he has acquired such &amp; such Good Things, they will
<PB N="11" REF="002451_0012_0FDB54DA22B96F50"/>
<HI>Stay</HI> with him; <HI>His mountain shall be strong.</HI> Lo, These things <HI>make to themselves wings, &amp; flee away,</HI> and leave him destitute; leave him distracted. It is <HI>Promised</HI> unto him, that he shall have a <HI>Long time</HI> yet in his way; <HI>Goods laid up for many Years.</HI> Lo, <HI>This Night thy Soul is required of thee!</HI> When a man takes the way of Sin, it may be said of him, as Isa. 44. 20. <HI>A deceived Heart hath turned him aside.</HI></P>
<P>And you may <HI>Mark</HI> this one <HI>Deceit</HI> more, than which there is hardly any more fre∣quent, in the Way of a wicked man, He is <HI>deceived</HI> about the <HI>Nature,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Period</HI> of his Way. He is not apprehensive, <HI>what</HI> he is a doing, &amp; <HI>where</HI> he is a going. He apprehends no other, but that he may take this Way, &amp; yet not miss of Everlasting Blessedness. It is as we read, Prov. 14. 12. <HI>A way that seems right to a man, but the end the way of death.</HI> Poor Sinner; Thou art a <HI>Self-deceiver!</HI> The man <HI>dreams,</HI> that he is in the <HI>way to the City of God;</HI> and that a Merciful God, will easily forgive all the <HI>False steps</HI> he has taken in his way, up∣on his bare saying, <HI>Lord, Have Mercy upon</HI> me! The <HI>Dream</HI> is anon found, a most fearful De∣lusion, The Chains of Darkness anon laid up∣on him, <HI>Undeceive</HI> him. O dreadful Way of being <HI>Undeceived!</HI> Oh! how dreadful, to be so late <HI>Undeceived!</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. There is this to be <HI>Marked</HI> in the
<PB N="12" REF="002451_0013_0FDB54DB9F632030"/>
<HI>way that wicked men have trodden;</HI> The Way grows more <HI>Dirty;</HI> Men grow <HI>worse &amp; worse,</HI> the longer they go on in the <HI>way.</HI> We read, 2 Tim 3. 13. <HI>Wicked men will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay worse and worse.</HI> Men rarely keep at a <HI>Stand</HI> in the way of Sin.

We read, Heb. 3 13 <HI>To Day,—l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin.</HI> You ought with a trem∣bling Soul, to <HI>Mark</HI> this thing; The <HI>Longer</HI> any one does continue in Sin, they grow the more <HI>Hardened</HI> in it; The Hearts which to Day were <HI>Hard</HI> enough, grow <HI>Harder</HI> by to Morrow.

O You that are in the <HI>Way of wicked men;</HI> Little do you foresee, what <HI>Wickedness</HI> you will be left unto.</P>
<P>Sixthly. There is this to be <HI>Marked</HI> in the <HI>Way that wicked men have trodden;</HI> Men often begin to <HI>Repent</HI> of the Way, &amp; yet they <HI>hold

on their way.</HI> In the <HI>way of Wickedness,</HI> there often occurs, this wretched Conduct, Psal. 78. 34, 36. <HI>They returned and enquired Early after God;—But they lied unto Him.</HI> A Gracious God often Checks the Sinner in his way; A <HI>Flaming Sward</HI> gives a Check to him, in his <HI>way that is perverse</HI> before God Perhaps, the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> within him, gives unusual Blazes and Scorches: Compels him to be bit∣terly sensible of his Condition. He falls it may be into some <HI>unusual Miscarriage,</HI> &amp; his wounded Soul falls a bleeding upon it. Some <HI>Uncommon Dispensation</HI> of God, it may be, a∣wakens him to Consider his Ways, <HI>dwakening things</HI> fall out, upon him, or before him. Now, he begins to wish, O! <HI>That I might lead a better Life!</HI> He Bewails his <HI>former Follies.</HI> He Cries out of them as <HI>Cursed Follies.</HI> He Resolves that he will no more abandon himself to such <HI>Follies.</HI> He makes his <HI>Vows</HI> to God, &amp; says, <HI>I will no more Transgress!</HI> He begins a <HI>Reforma∣tion;</HI> begins a Course of Religious Duties. His best Friends hoped, Surely we shall now see a Glorious <HI>Conversion</HI> to God! But what comes of all this? All wears off in a little while. His <HI>Vows</HI> do signify no more than the <HI>Green Wyths,</HI> or the <HI>New Cords</HI> upon <HI>Sampson.</HI> It may be said, as in 2 Pet 2. 22 <HI>The Dog is turned to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own Vomit again; &amp; the Sow that was wash∣ed unto her wallowing in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire.</HI> The <HI>Good

Yea The <HI>Evil Spirit returns</HI> with <HI>Seven worse</HI> than what was before. O Case that calls for bleeding Lamentations! <HI>Mark</HI> this; The <HI>Way of wicked men,</HI> has now and then some <HI>Interruptions</HI> in it: There are some feeble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards <HI>Repentance</HI> in it. But still, after all, they <HI>go on still in their Trespasses.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly. In the <HI>Way that wicked men have trodden,</HI> there is this Thing that calls for a <HI>Mark</HI> upon it, When men in their Way grow <HI>Wicked Overmuch,</HI> oftentimes they <HI>Quickly Perish</HI> from their <HI>Way.</HI> We read, Eccl 7. 17. <HI>Be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever much wicked; why shouldest thou die before thy time?</HI> Some there are that are <HI>wick∣ed Overmuch:</HI> They are so far <HI>gone in Wicked∣ness,</HI> that they have Out-sinned the Day of <HI>Divine Patience.</HI> The <HI>Long-suffering</HI> God will now bear no longer with them. The wicked ones bid intolerable <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fiances to Heaven</HI> in their Blasphemies <HI>Monstrous Undutifulness</HI> to their Superiors is expressed by them. They <HI>Mark</HI> the Ministers and Messengers of God, with outragious Insolenci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. They grow so dangerous to <HI>Humane Society,</HI> that there is no Enduring of them They fall to hatching such <HI>Mischief,</HI> that the Children of God are
<PB N="16" REF="002451_0017_0FDB54E8605E1A30"/>
compelled to Complain unto their Father of them. The Wretches are now probably near the <HI>End</HI> of their Way. There is a dire∣ful Symptom of wicked and wretched Ones, hastening to their End; in Prov 29. 1. <HI>He that being often Reproved, hardeneth his Neck, shall suddenly be destroyed and without Remedy.</HI> Oh! That some <HI>Ungodly</HI> Ones would lay to Heart, these Thunders of God!</P>
<P>Eighthly. In the <HI>Way that wicked men have trodden,</HI> there is this Thing that calls for a <HI>Mark</HI> upon it, God by <HI>Wonderful Ways</HI> does bring out, the most <HI>Secret Wickedness</HI> in their Way. In the <HI>Way of wicked men,</HI> there are many things done, for which they flatter themselves with an Eternal <HI>Secrecy;</HI> for, as we read, Eph. 5 17. <HI>They are things that are done of them in Secret</HI> But the Crimes of wicked Ones are not Concealed from God; <HI>Can any hide himself in Secret Places, that I shall not see him, saith the Lord?</HI> Let never such <HI>Arts of Concealment</HI> be used for the <HI>Covering</HI> of their Crimes, <HI>I, even I, Know them; and am a Witness of them, saith the Lord</HI> And the Glo∣rious God has astonishing Ways to bring out the <HI>Secret Wickedness</HI> in which wicked Men do indulge themselves. God fulfils that word upon them, Numb 32. 33. <HI>Be sure your Sin shall find you out.</HI> He makes the <HI>Accomplices</HI> of Wicked ones, to bring out one another.
<PB N="17" REF="002451_0018_0FDB54EC6901D938"/>
God leaves Wicked Ones to <HI>fresh Villanies,</HI> which bring out all their <HI>former</HI> ones. God so <HI>Terrifies</HI> them, as to make them bring out themselves; their <HI>own Tongues to fall upon them∣selves.</HI> Odd Circumstances fall out, that no one could have thought of; and these bring them out. Yea, <HI>A Bird of the Air shall carry the Voice</HI> &amp; <HI>that which has wings will tell the mat∣ter:</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the <HI>Invisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le World</HI> will be Concerned in it. Oh! Let the <HI>Sinners in Zion be afraid,</HI> and let the <HI>Hypocrites thereof be sur∣prised with Fearfulness,</HI> that what they have done, will not always be kept <HI>Secret</HI> Repent Seriously, Repent Sincerely; That is the only way for the <HI>Covering</HI> of Iniquity.</P>
<P>Ninthly. In the <HI>Way that wicked men have trodden,</HI> there is vet One thing more to be <HI>Marked;</HI> That is, The <HI>End</HI> of the <HI>Way.</HI> Tis a <HI>Way</HI> that will be terribly Punished in the <HI>End;</HI> It will be <HI>Bitterness in the Latter End.</HI> We are called upon, Psal. 37. 37. <HI>Mark the per∣fect man, and behold the upright, for the End of that man is peace.</HI> But we are now to be thus called upon. <HI>Mark</HI> the <HI>Wicked man, &amp; behold the Evil one, &amp; his Evil Way; for the End of his Way, is to ly down in desperate &amp; eternal Sorrow.</HI> Sinners, You are warned of God; Prov 13 21 <HI>Evil pursueth Sinners.</HI> The <HI>Warning</HI> that God has given you, is, <HI>The wicked shall not go Un∣punished.</HI> Nay, <HI>There is a strange Punishment
<PB N="18" REF="002451_0019_0FDB54EF203F3408"/>
reserved for the Workers of Iniquity. O Mark</HI> the <HI>Way,</HI> which the Righteous God has <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken with wicked men,</HI> and Mark the <HI>Destruction</HI> which their <HI>Way</HI> does bring upon them.</P>
<P>Wicked men have been Punished in all A∣ges. They were so when their <HI>Foundation was Overthrown with a Flood.</HI> They shall be so, when God shall make this World of theirs, &amp; for them, a <HI>Fiery Oven, in the Day of His Anger.</HI> In every Generation a multitude of Wicked ones, are most <HI>Remarkably Punished</HI> by God. Yea, their Punishments are such as carry in them <HI>Remarkable Signatures</HI> of a <HI>Judgment</HI> from God. <HI>At Last,</HI> it comes to that; Mat. 25 46 <HI>The Wicked shall go away into everlasting Punish∣ment</HI> O amazing <HI>Punishment!</HI> O tremendous <HI>Punishment! Mark</HI> this, O all you that <HI>Forget</HI> God. You will find it a fearful <HI>Thing</HI> to dy the <HI>Second Death;</HI> to <HI>fall into the Hands of the Living God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. And now, methinks, there should be another Enquiry; In <HI>what Manner,</HI> To <HI>what Purpose,</HI> are we to <HI>Mark the Way that Wicked Men have trodden? How</HI> are we to Observe what is to be <HI>Mark'd in the Way of wicked men?</HI> But I may now surely leave it unto <HI>You,</HI> my Hearers, to answer this Enquiry You are not at a Loss how to answer it.</P>
<P>First; Have you <HI>Marked the way that wicked men have trodden?</HI> Certainly you will <HI>Shun</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002451_0020_0FDB54F0A10CFFA0"/>
that Way The Bias of your Souls, Oh, how can it now be any other than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Psal. 119 128 <HI>I hate every false way</HI> The <HI>Choice</HI> &amp; the <HI>Voice</HI> of your Souls will now be that; <Q>O m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dear Saviour, Do thou rescue me from every <HI>Wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> from all the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Destroyer S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Way, Teach me thy Pathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> O my Good <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reduce my Soul, &amp; Conduct me in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Righteous∣ness for thy Names sake.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Secondly; <HI>Have you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Way that Wicked men have trodden?</HI> Certainly You will do what you can, to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from that way.</HI> Ah, how can you bear to see your <HI>Friends,</HI> go∣ing on in a Way, that will carry them <HI>down unto the Dead?</HI> Think on that Word Jam. 5 20 <HI>He that Converts a Sinner from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his way, shall save a Soul from Death.</HI> Especially, Your <HI>Children,</HI>—to them you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>we this Com∣passion. <HI>No greater Joy,</HI> than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see them <HI>Walking in the</HI> Truth No greater Vexation, or Abasement, than to see them take <HI>another Way</HI> Oh! Teach them Oh! Charge them! Oh! Cry to God for them! Do all you can to Reclaim them, and Preserve them from every <HI>Evil Way</HI> Lay the strongest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon them, to <HI>Keep the way of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly; I have one thing more to move, Tis this; My Friends, <HI>Mark</HI> Your <HI>Own Way. Mark the way</HI> which you are <HI>Your selves</HI> tread∣ing

Or, Am I in the Way of Good men?</HI></Q> Unquestionably Happy, Happy might be the Fruits of this <HI>Question</HI> well thought upon!</P>
<P>¶ But that which at this <HI>time</HI> I principally aim at, is; To Confirm the <HI>Observations</HI> that has been offered, and Quicken the <HI>Dispositions</HI> that have been advised, with some Solemn <HI>Remarks</HI> upon as tremendous a Spectacle, as ever our sorrowful Eyes have look'd upon. <HI>The Way that Wicked Men have trodden,</HI> has newly terminated in a Tragical Execution of <HI>Death,</HI> on such a Number of Criminals, as our sorrowful Eyes have never before seen toge∣ther, <HI>with hands clapped at them, hissed out of their Place.</HI> The Glorious GOD Expects, that we do the best we can, to make this a <HI>Profitable</HI> &amp; a <HI>Serviceable</HI> Spectacle; and that our Fool∣hardy Sinners, <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord,</HI> may be <HI>Disswaded</HI> from <HI>going on still in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trespasses</HI> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as a thing once imagined con∣cerning some surviving Impenitents, <HI>If One went unto them from the Dead, they will Repent.</HI> O Impenitents, that in the <HI>Way</HI> which <HI>Wicked

If you will not hear the Warnings of your Faithful <HI>Pastors,</HI> hear the Roarings of Twenty Six <HI>ter∣rible Preachers,</HI> that in a Ghastly Apparition, are now <HI>from the Dead,</HI> calling upon you to <HI>Turn</HI> &amp; <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD.</P>
<P>It was the Hand of the Glorious GOD, which brought these Criminals, to Dy in a Place, where His Faithful Servants took un∣common Pains, for their <HI>Instruction</HI> &amp; <HI>Conver∣sion;</HI> And it may be, [<HI>Who can tell?</HI>] there were some <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lect</HI> of GOD among them, who may have <HI>their Salvation</HI> in this astonishing way accomplished But how much will it add unto the Displays of Sovereign &amp; Myste∣rious <HI>Grace,</HI> if You that have had their <HI>Dying</HI> Words &amp; Groans &amp; Pains before you, may find the Means of <HI>Your Salvation</HI> in them!</P>
<P>Oh! Take a due Notice of what you have seen in the <HI>Way</HI> which these <HI>Wicked men have trodden,</HI> &amp; in the <HI>fearful End</HI> which their <HI>Way</HI> has brought them to! and let it not be said of you, <HI>Go tell this People, you see indeed, but perceive no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> &amp; very little Regard what you see.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>HAving a great desire to leave these few advices behind me, to all Young Peo∣ple, or Others: God Grant they may be of that Use, &amp; Warning to you, as I could Wish! Remember, they are the Words, of a Dying person, Seal'd with his Life, &amp; ought to make a great Impression in your Hearts. Think, it is one, who not many Months ago, as little thought as any of you, of coming to this Ignominious Death, that in this manner Speaks to you. God's Will be done, I Hum∣bly resign my self to it, well Knowing it is Sin and the Neglect of the Service of God, that has occasioned it. And O that it may Please the Great &amp; Glorious God of Heaven &amp; Earth! To give every one of you Grace, to Avoid the Snares I have fallen into.</P>
<P><HI>Youths,</HI> Early Fear God, and Honour &amp; Obey your Parents; They know better what is for your Good &amp; Interest, than you your selves. Let not the Vain Notion of Rambling contrary to their Will, take any Root in your Heart and Mind. This was the first Unhappy Step, which hindered the Perfecting of a Work, the Foundation whereof was so laid, as might have Plac'd me in a Station of Life, nothing Inferior to
<PB N="32" REF="002451_0033_0FDB551221AD8948"/>
some of the most Desireable. Think not, when you come to Act on the Stage of the World for your Self, that it is enough you lead, (as some term it) a Moral Life, that it is enough if you deal upon the Square with your Neighbour, Give Alms and do good Offices. Alas too many sit down Content∣edly there. But add to this Religious and Vertuous, and your Account will end fair. Whatever you do, Neglect not the Publick &amp; Private Worship of God, &amp; your Under∣takings will always Prosper. Always Choose good Company. And if you can, rather your Superiors in all things than Inferiors, such as Live in the Fear of GOD. By them you may Learn good Things, and greatly Advantage thereby. Live Soberly, and let not yourselves be overcome with Strong Drink. Fly all Temptations, all Opportu∣nities &amp; Importunities, tending that way. Alas it's a Sad thing, a too reigning Vice among Men, the Inlet of Numberless Sins &amp; Evils, the Ruin of a great many Families, And what is it it has not been the Cause of? Then you ly open to the Snares &amp; Temp∣tations of the bitter Enemy of the Souls of Men. Beware of the Abominable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Uncleanness, if you Value the Love of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and your Reputation in the World.

Road, tho'tless, where it may at last hurry them. Laugh at it and think it no Crime. Suffer not, Suffer not the least Spark of that Infernal Fire of Lust, to hover about your Heart and Mind, much more to settle there. For it will too soon Kindle, and too soon be your Master. Take care against Spending your time Idly on the Sabbath Day, in stay∣ing a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Home, or Walking, or any other Di∣versions, though they may seen to you, of no great Moment, Repent of this in Time, &amp; Diligently Frequent your Proper Places of Divine Worship, Respect your Fastors &amp; Teachers, &amp; Remember whose Servants they be, and pay the just Deference due to the Rulers, set over you by God. If you fall into any Difference with your Friends or Relations, God Almighty Prevent you from rashly leaving them. Stay in your Place &amp; Station Contentedly, &amp; be Thank∣ful to God for all things that happen to you. And whoever shall Read these Lines, &amp; finds any thing therein Affecting his Conscience, shun them as with alacrity, as you would an Eminent Danger before your Eyes: Think on them as the Cause, of what the Unhappy Author, through the Just Judgment of God, is brought to by them.

<P>Another had these following things written from his Mouth,</P>
<Q><P>I Do stand here a sad Spectacle unto you all this Day. I pray God it may be a Warning unto you. The first Counsel which I offer unto you (especially unto Youths) is, Seek the Lord Early, while He may be found; spend not your blooming Years in such things as gratify the sinful Flesh: Let God be your first Monitor, lest the Adversary of our Souls Intercept be∣tween God &amp; us: Oh that this sad Example &amp; dismal Execution which you see upon us poor condemned &amp; dying Sinners this Day, may be sanctified unto you all; especially in the first Place, that you mavn't resist the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; motions of God's Holy Spirit, whilst the Day of Grace lasts. Secondly, Do not Prophane the Holy Name of your God, by Cursing &amp; bad Imprecations against your holy Maker and Redeemer. Thirdly, Do not Prophane his holy Sabbaths, by spend∣ing the Day in Illness, or other lascivious Courses, which Youths are prone unto: It
<PB N="36" REF="002451_0037_0FDB551C217C3848"/>
is pleasing unto the Flesh, but desstructive to the Soul in the sight of God. Fourthly, Let not loose the Reins of your Lusts to gratify the Flesh, which is a heinous &amp; cry∣ing Sin in the sight of God. If any of you have been guilty hereof, or of any Thing herein included, I would pray you to Re∣pent of each of them instantly, before God's indignation be poured out upon you, and that you be left unto your selves: Oh then your Case will be miserable. Fifthly, I be∣seech you and each of you, to mind the Ad∣monitions &amp; sweet Instructions of your na∣tural Parents, lest you grieve their Hearts, &amp; their Sighs go up to Heaven as Witnesses against you. Sixthly, Covet not any thing appertaining or belonging to your Neigh∣bour; so as to have a lustful Concupiscence after their Lives, Goods or Estates. Oh, these are the Things which ly burthensome and heavy upon me a poor dying Sinner, I have liv'd lasciviously, &amp; spent the chief of my Time wantonly and foolishly, as if there had been no God to call me to Question for all my Miscarriages, or Misimprovements of Time; these lye heavy &amp; burthen some up∣on my Soul; were it not for the Blood of Christ, What would become of such poor, miserable, dying Sinners as we? But our Comfort is, that the Fountain which was
<PB N="37" REF="002451_0038_0FDB55210521FAE8"/>
open to Judah &amp; Jerusalem, is still sufficient to cleanse from all unrighteousness; Oh that we all may be washed and cleansed in this Fountain, so as that we may appear spot∣less &amp; blameless before the great Bar of God, so as to receive that Blessed Sentence of, <HI>Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before the Foundation of the World.</HI> The chief thing that induced me to make my Escape, was the frailty of the Flesh, being afraid to Dy. But now I desire to submit unto the Hand of Providence, Forgiving all my Adversaries, Persecutors, and Slanderers, as I expect Forgiveness at the Hand of God, into whose Hands I com∣mit my Spirit.</P></Q>
<P>Another of these Criminals, gave these fol∣lowing Admonitions for the Benefit of Survivors:</P>
<Q><P>I Do earnestly warn all the People of this Land, the Young People especially, &amp; in particular, the Young People of <HI>Rhode∣Island,</HI>—against all Wickedness in general, and particularly against Sabbath-breaking, which I take to have been my First Crying Sin: Against Drunkenness, which I think, was the Second great Sin I fell into: Against Uncleanness, Unchastity, and running after Lewd Women: Against Cursing &amp; Swear∣ing,
<PB N="38" REF="002451_0039_0FDB55221F264610"/>
and mispending precious Time And as for Sea faring Men, my earnest desire is, That they may be kept from falling into the Hand of the Pirates; &amp; if they be taken by them, that they mayn't Turn to them, &amp; if they be so Wicked as to Turn to them, I Warn them against increasing their Wic∣kedness by abusing any whom they shall Take, as I have done. As for my self, in respect of what is to come, I hope to find Mercy at the Hands of God, for the sake of His own dear Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</P></Q>
<P>On the Day before they were Executed, Letters were Wrote for divers of them, to some or other of their Relations, in which they desired such Passages as here follow, might be inserted:</P>
<P>ONE of them in a Letter to his Brother, says, <HI>I earnestly intreat you, Dear Brother, to bring up your Children in the Fear of Almighty GOD:</HI> And having desired him to write to his Wife, &amp; Children, having four of them, he adds, <HI>I pray God to be a Husband to my dear Wife, and a Father to my dear Children; &amp; that she may bring them up in the Fear of GOD; and that she &amp; they together may be for ever happy in Heaven, I advise your Children (Dear Brother) &amp; Charge, my own dear Children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to go astray from God or lead a wicked Life, at many have done, &amp; I my self.</HI></P>

Another in a Letter to his Brother says, <HI>I intreat you &amp; all other Young People, to avoid all bad Courses, especially neglecting Prayer to God, Prophane Swearing &amp; Cursing, Hard-Drinking, &amp; Sabbath-Breaking. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not without Hopes, that after all I shall enter into a happy State at Death for the sake of Christ. Don't you however delay from Time to Time, to turn to God and get fit to Dye.</HI></P>
<P>A Third in a Letter to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> says, <HI>I earnestly desire you to bring up your Children in the Fear of God, that they mayn't go astray from Him as I have done: I pray God that my Dear Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther</HI> (meaning his Sister's Husband) <HI>who goes to Sea, may be Preserved from falling into the Hands of the Pirates; and that if he does fall into their Hands, he may have Grace, to over∣come all their Temptations to be one of their Num∣ber, be they never so great. I must thank my self for it, that I am brought to this untimely dismal End. I beg that it may be a Warning to all Young People to keep themselves from all Bad Courses especially from Sabbath-Breaking, Drinking to Excess, and Blaspheming the Name of God. And I beseech all that are Servants, to keep with, and be faithful to their Masters; for if I had been Dutiful to mine, 'tis likely, I had not been brought to the untimely End, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> am now come to.</HI></P>
<P>A Letter of another to his Father has these Passages in it: <HI>Please to remember my Love to
<PB N="40" REF="002451_0041_0FDB55282ADD05C0"/>
my Brother &amp; Sisters, and let my Brother know, that I earnestly desire, he will bring up hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Children in the Fear of God. And I would have my Un∣cles &amp; Aunts Warn their Children, against all Sin, especially the Sin of Sabbath-Breaking, lest it bring them to Ruin as it has done me.</HI></P>
<P>Another in a Letter to his Mother, Ad∣dresses her thus: <HI>The News of my being under a Sentence of Death, I believe is very sinking &amp; dreadful to you. I pray that God will support you under your Sorrows &amp; sanctify them to you. I hope I shall receive from GOD the Pardon of all my Sins, for the sake of His dear SON and the only SAVIOUR of Sinners. I pray GOD to help me to believe in Christ, Repent of all my Sins &amp; fit for Death. I am sorry to think, that I was so circumstanced while among the Pirates, as to want the Opportunities which I had before, of Be∣nefitting my Soul, &amp; fitting for Eternity.</HI> And in a Letter to his Brother, He thus bespeaks him, <HI>I earnestly beseech you to seek the Lord for your self &amp; yours, while He may be found. Don't regl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct to bring your Children up in the Fear of God. I hope you will as far as you can, &amp; may, keep them from going to Sea. Let them take Warning by me not to go astray from God while Young. Let my Death stir you up to make your Peace with God, &amp; fit for your own Death with∣out Delay. I hope you will take the best Care you can, of our Aged Mother while she is Living, and at her Death.</HI></P>

<P>I Desire you all in General to take Warn∣ing by me; for you see what a Greedy Eye brings a Young Man to. Beware how you Disobey your Friends. Beware of Drunkenness, for it is the Inlet of all other Sins. I must Confess that I was not Guilty of Murder, nor of Striking Men as others were: But of all other Sins I was Guilty, of which I ask God Pardon. I have been guilty of Offending &amp; Denying Thee the God that is above, in Profaning thy Holy Name &amp; Sabbath, &amp; Polluting of thy Ordinances, &amp; also committing all the Injuries we were capable of, upon our Neighbours Bodies or Goods in a manner. I Desire you all to O∣bey your Parents, give a good Ear to the Preachers of God, this Slighted have I; Shun Theft, Drunkenness Swearing, Evil∣Speaking, Lying, and all Evil Frays. So I leave you to GOD &amp; the World: And I hope I am Provided for a better World, &amp; a Glorious Heavenly Kingdom.</P>

<P>Another Desired, That Masters would not be Harsh &amp; Severe to their Servants, &amp; that Servants would be Dutiful to their Masters, and Diligent in their Business. Another Desired, That Parents, would be Careful, To

bring up their Children well, &amp; that Children would not Grieve, nor Sinfully leave their Pa∣rents. Divers of them lamented their Diso∣bedience to their Parents, &amp; their Prophana∣tion of the Name, Day and Word of God &amp; their ungodly company Keeping; &amp; warned Young People, To Keep clear from those Crimes. The most of them could Acknow∣ledge, That they had Lived some Part of their Time, under the Means of Grace: And they did not Accept the Offers of Christ, And God left them to Leave Him, and get Abroad into the wild World, and then they Quickly got into the High Road to Wicked∣ness and Misery, and were guilty of Grievous and Various Violations of all the Holy Com∣mandments of God, They Ran as far as they could from God, and strove as far as they could, To Keep all Thoughts of God out of their Minds: They cast off Fear &amp; Restrained Prayer before God: They Blasphemed His Name and Prophaned His Day; so that some of them scarce new when it was the Lords∣Day, (while they were one the Seas:) They Ran away, some of them, from their Parents. They gave up themselves, To Drunkenness, Uncleanness, Dishonesty, Evil Speaking and Covetousness. And the most seemed to have no Thought of Returning from their wicked Courses.</P>

Thus Far had they gone from God! But when they were brought into Prison, They Quickly seemed Thankful to God, for His Mercy in bringing them thither. And they set and kept up something of Daily Religion, for the most Part, among them and seemed Serious and Reverent, while Reading and Hearing their Prayers, and the Holy Scrip∣tures, &amp; the most Awakening Books of Piety, and Singing Psalms; And were Thankful for the counsels that were offered, and very De∣sirous of the continuance of all Advantages, that could be Afforded, as long as they could be continued. And wished that they had spent their Past and Lost Time, as they had spent some of their last Days, And wished for more Time, and Feared that they should not have Enough Time, To secure the welfare of their Souls. But seemed willing, to submit into the Divine Will, Trying to Hope in the Mercy of God, &amp; Resign their Souls into the Merciful Hands of the Almighty Saviour. So it was with several of them, tho' all of them did not seem always alike Affected and Concerned. Never was there a more Dole∣ful Sight, in all this Land, than while they were standing on the Stage, waiting for the stopping of their Breath, and the Flying of their Souls into the Eternal World; And Oh! How Awful the Noise of their Dying
