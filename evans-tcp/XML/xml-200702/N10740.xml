<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF THE PEOPLE's NATURAL RIGHT TO A SHARE in the LEGISLATURE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AN accurate and critical knowledge of law (such as can only be acquired by much reading and long experience in the profes∣sion) is indeed a necessary qualification for those persons who undertake to deliver their opinions con∣cerning the nicer and more difficult questions of jurisprudence, but when the Natural Rights of any of our fellow subjects are apparently at stake, every man has a right to judge for himself, and to declare his sentiments, as far as plain conclusions of reason and common sense will fairly warrant; and such only are referred to in the following <HI>Declaration of the Natural Right of popular Representation in the Legislature.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Amongst all the rights and privileges appertaining unto us,</Q> said that truly noble lawyer Lord Som∣mers<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Judgment of whole Kingdoms, &amp;c. P. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>, <Q>that of having a share in the legislation,
<PB N="4" REF="013613_0003_0F905BD7DA9AD250"/>
and being to be governed by such laws as we our∣selves shall chuse, is the most fundamental and essential, as well as the most advantageous and be∣neficial,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And as all British subjects, whether in Great Bri∣tain, Ireland, or the Colonies, are equally free by the Law of Nature, they certainly are equally en∣titled to the same Natural Rights that are essential for their own preservation, because this privilege of "having a share in the legislation" is not merely a British Right, peculiar to this island, but it is also a Natural Right, which cannot, without the most flagrant and stimulating injustice, be withdrawn from any part of the British empire by any worldly authority whatsoever, because, <Q>by the Natural Law, whereunto he [Almighty God] hath made all sub∣ject,</Q> says the learned Hooker<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, lib. 1, § 10, p. 87.</NOTE>, <Q>the lawful power of making laws, to command whole politic societies of men, belongeth so properly unto the same entire societies, that for any Prince or Po∣tentate, of what kind soever upon earth, to ex∣ercise the same of himself, [or themselves,] and not either by express commission immediately and personally received from God, or else by authority derived at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws, it is no better than mere tyranny! Laws they are not, therefore, which public approbation hath not made so.</Q> Agree∣able to the same just principles of natural equity is that maxim of the English constitution, that "LAW, TO BIND ALL, MUST BE ASSENTED TO BY ALL," (Principia Leg. et Equit. p. 56.) and there can be no legal appearance of ASSENT without some degree of REPRESENTATION.</P>

It must indeed be acknowledged, that the Re∣presentation of the people of England is not so per∣fect as equity may seem to require, since very many individuals have no vote in elections and consequent∣ly cannot be said expressly to give their assent to the laws by which they are governed. Nevertheless, the whole country which they inhabit, and in which they earn their bread, and even the very houses in which they live (whether they are housekeepers or lodgers) are represented<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">I must beg leave to refer the reader also to some excellent observations on this head, in a pamphlet published since the above was written, entitled <HI>An Argument in Defence of the Co∣lonies,</HI> p. 76, 77, and 78.</NOTE> by the votes of the re∣spective proprietors, since every Freeholder has a right to vote; so that, in this one respect, the re∣presentation is general; and, though far from equal, would still be a sufficient check against arbitrary power; and afford sufficient security for the lives and property of those persons who have no vote, if the laws against parliamentary corruption (and especially that act of 7 and 8 Wil. III. c. 4.) were duly en∣forced; and also if all persons, who are entrusted with the disposal of public money, were required to render a strict account of it, and to be severely pu∣nished whenever convicted of exerting the influence of the public treasury against public liberty, which is the most baneful treachery and dishonesty that men in office (who are the servants of the public as well as of the King) can possibly commit. But, notwith∣standing the inequality of the English representa∣tion, and the various means practised to corrupt it, yet it has been the principal instrument of preserving amongst us those remains of natural Liberty which we still enjoy in a greater proportion than most other kingdoms, and has occasioned more examples of just retribution on <HI>Tyrants, Traitors,</HI> and <HI>Court

Favourites,</HI> in the English annals, than the history of any other nation affords; so that Mr. Rapin is thereby led to conclude his account of K. Richard II. (that notorious corrupter of parliaments, and enemy to the privileges of London and other corporations) with the following reflection: <Q>That, in a government such as that of England, all the efforts that the Sovereign makes to usurp an absolute authority, are so many steps which lead him towards the precipice.</Q><NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><Q>C'est que dans un Gouvernement tel que celui d' Ang∣leterre, tous les efforts que le Souverain fait pour usurper un pouvoir absolu sont autant de pas qui le conduisent vers le precipice.</Q> <BIBL>Tom. iii. liv. x. p. 329.</BIBL></NOTE> It is manifest, therefore, that the constitutional government of England, even with all its defects, is infinitely better than any other form of government whereby the people are de∣prived of their just share in the legislature;<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">The celebrated Chancellor Fortescue asserts, that a li∣mited or politic government (like that of England) is infinitely more eligible, for the interest and satisfaction even of the Prince himself, than an absolute regal power:—<Q>Non jugum sed libertas est politicè regere populum; securitas quoque maxi∣ma nedum plebi, sed et ipsi regi; allevatio etiam non mini∣ma solicitudinis suae:</Q>—<ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> <Q>That to rule the people by government politic is no yoke, but liberty, and great secu∣rity, not only to the subjects, but also to the King himself; and further, no small lightening or easement to his charge.</Q> (De Laud. Leg. Angl. cap. 34, p. 78.) So that those politi∣cians, who plead the necessity of securing, at any rate, a ma∣jority in parliament, to vote implicitly for whatever the minis∣ter proposes, do miserably betray the true interest and peace of their Sovereign! for this fixes upon the King and his ministers (as in arbitrary governments) the blame and ignominy of every determination that happens to be wrong, which would otherwise either have been overruled by the free council of the nation, or else must have been equally imputed to the people themselves; and yet this wretched policy has alternately been adopted by all parties, notwithstanding that it is founded (like many of Machiavel's doctrines) on that abominable antichristian prin∣ciple of mere worldly minded men,—"Let us do evil that good may come;"—"whose damnation (says the apostle to the Ro∣mans) is just." Rom. iii. 8.

that the inequality of Representation in this island, affords no just argument for setting aside the Repre∣sentation of the people in other parts of the British empire, because experience teaches us, that even a defective Representation is better than none at all; and therefore it is highly unreasonable, and contrary to natural equity, to pretend that our brethren and fellow subjects in the more distant parts of the British empire ought to be deprived entirely of their natural Rights and Liberties, merely because our own liberties are not entirely perfect! or because our own representation in the legislature appears, in some few respects, to be defective! and it would be quite as unreasonable to alledge, that the prin∣ciple or reason of the maxim before quoted (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that law, to bind all, must be assented to by all) is unjust and inconclusive, merely because it would be very difficult to accomplish it literally by the express assent of every individual! but it is clearly sufficient that the maxim be construed to signify that delegated assent of the people by a majority of their legal representatives, which is constitutionally necessary to make all laws binding;<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nedum principis voluntate, sed et totius regni assensu, ipsa (i. e.

In every point of view, the making laws for the subjects of any part of the British Empire, without their participation and assent, in iniquitous, and therefore unlawful; for though the purport of any law, so made, be in itself perfectly just and equit∣able, yet it becomes otherwise<NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Qui aliquid statuerit parte inaudita altera, aequum licet dixerit, haud aequum fecerit.</Q><BIBL> Princip.

The free representation of the people in the legis∣lature is, therefore, to be esteemed, of all our rights, the most essential, (as Lord Sommers has declared) to maintain that excellent equilibrium of power, or mixt government, limited by law, which our ancestors have always most zealously asserted, and transmitted to us, as our best birthright and inheritance<NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Major haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a jure et legibus quam a parentibus.</Q><BIBL> 2 Inst. 56.</BIBL></NOTE>; so that every attempt to set the same aside in any degree, or in any part of the em∣pire,

If, therefore, King William, in the eye of the Law, be our King, we must in conscience pay obedience to to him as such. I take this (says he) for a certain truth, that as the law makes the King, so the same law extends, or limits, or transfers, our obedience and allegiance; and all oaths, imposed by law, oblige the conscience no farther than the law meant they should oblige. Only this is always to be remembered, that whatever obedience the laws of the land require of us, it is to be understood with this proviso, that it be not contradictory to the laws of God.

<P>But more particularly the Parliament has no power to give up the ancient and established right of the people to be represented in the legislature, because an act for so base a purpose would entirely subvert the principles and constitution on which the very existence of the legislature itself, which ordain∣ed it, is formed! so that such an unnatural act of the state would be parallel to the crime of felo de se in a private person; and, being thus contrary to <Q>the nature of things, can never be rendered valid by any authority whatsoever</Q><NOTE N="(18)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Quae rerum naturâ prohibentur nulla lege confirma∣ta sunt.</Q><BIBL> Finch, 74.</BIBL> And <Q>Nihil quod est contra rati∣onem est licitum.</Q><BIBL> Co.

For as it so clearly
<PB N="13" REF="013613_0012_0F905BE05E1051D0"/>
appears, from what has been said, that natural equity does not permit even the inferior property of lands, goods, chattels, or money, to be alienated without the consent or fault of the proprietors, much less can it permit the alienation, annulling, or changing, of our most valuable inheritance, the law, without the due assent and consent of the he∣ritors themselves, the people at large, or their law∣ful Representatives in their respective assemblies or parliaments<NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nam non potest rex Angliae, ad libitum suum, leges mutare regni sui. Principatu namque nedum regali, sed et politico, ipse suo populo dominatur.</Q> And again: <Q>Quia nec leges, ipse [rex] fine subditorum assensu mutare po∣terit, nec subjectum populum renitentem onerare inposi∣tionibus peregrinis; quare populus ejus libere fruetur bonis suis, legibus, quas cupit, regulatus, nec per regem suum, aut quemvis alium depilatur,</Q> &amp;c. <BIBL>Chancel.

This is a necessary conclusion of reason and common sense, drawn from the effect and force of natural equity, even in cases of much less consequence (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> respecting goods and common pecuniary property;) so that the distinction, which some great and able politicians have lately made, between Taxation and Legislation (in the late dis∣putes about taxing the Colonies) was certainly er∣roneous, though well intended; since it plainly ap∣pears, that the right of legislation is not less inse∣parable, by natural equity, from the people of every part of the British empire than the right of granting or with-holding taxes; for, otherwise, the free subjects of one part of the empire would be liable to be most materially injured in their greatest and most valuable inheritance, the law, by the hasty decisions of men on the other side of the empire, with whom probably they would be totally unac∣quainted, and whose interest might perhaps be as

<P>The true constitutional mode of connecting Bri∣rish dominions, that are otherwise separated by na∣ture, is demonstrated by the established example of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, which, by long experience, has proved to be sufficiently effec∣tual. It must be acknowledged, indeed, that an act of Parliament was made in the 6th of George 1. chap. 5. wherein it is laid down, that <Q>the King and Parliament of Great-Britain may make laws to bind Ireland.</Q><NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot"><P>If the preceding arguments are not sufficient to prove in what light the said Act is to be considered, yet the present distinct and separate jurisdiction of the Irish Parliament, the continuation of their ancient and constitutional privileges, notwithstanding the doctrine asserted in the said Act, and their annual transactions, both in taxation and legislation, are facts which prove (better than arguments) that the people of Ire∣land have an inherent right to enact laws independant of the British Parliament; otherwise the King's assent would not be sufficient to render the said laws valid and binding without the especial approbation and consent also of the British Parliament, which indeed is never required; so far is it from being necessary! And, farther, the inhabitants of Great-Britain would think it extremely unreasonable and unjust, if the Parliament of Ire∣land should claim a right of making laws, with the King's assent, to bind any part of this island! The argument is re∣ciprocal; so that, if we should really detest such a measure against ourselves, the law of laws forbids us to claim the like power over any of our fellow subjects, without their free con∣sent. "Non facias alteri quod tibi non vis fieri." This is laid down as one of the most common precepts of the law of reason, (Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 7.) and such is the immutability of the law of reason, that against it there can be no prescription, statute, or custom; and if any are made contrary thereto, they are not to be esteemed statutes or customs, but corruptelae, i. e. corruptions or depravities.—<Q>Non sunt statuta five consuetu∣dines, sed corruptelae.</Q><BIBL> Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 5. </BIBL>To the same effect is that command of Christ himself (recorded in Matt. vii. 12.) which our Lord declared to be <Q>the Law and the Prophets;</Q> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets;</Q> so that it may justly be entituled, the Law of Laws; and a statute, therefore, which is contrary thereto, is doubly unlawful.</P>
<P>The separate interests of the two kingdoms are sufficiently restrained, with respect to each other, by our excellent consti∣tution of state, which requires the assent of the people (that is of those which are concerned respectively) to render any law valid and binding upon either nation; which the foregoing ar∣guments demonstrate; and I hope the ingenious and sensible author of the <HI>Argument in Defence of the Colonies</HI> (lately published) will acknowledge, that he has allowed too much, when he admits, in page 114, that <Q>the whole kingdom of Ireland is bound by the acts of the supreme legislature,</Q> &amp;c. which doctrine leads him afterwards to make a distinction between Taxation and Legislation.</P>
<P>And again, the two kingdoms are so firmly united by the bands of allegiance, to one head (or monarchy) of limited power, that their interests in all material external exigencies are thereby rendered mutual, as well as their internal interest, in the maintenance of natural and constitutional liberty, in each kingdom respectively, because one of them cannot be deprived of this (as they are governed by the same head) without hast∣ening the destruction of the other. And this intimate con∣nexion of mutual interest in the constitution of state, and in the reciprocal enjoyment of the same reasonable common law, whereby each kingdom enjoys an equality of privilege and natural freedom, renders the union of the two kingdoms more just and equitable, and, consequently, more safe and durable than it could possibly have been made by any other means; and the inhabitants of both islands (though sprung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by these means, acquired a certain mutual consideration for each other, as fellow subjects, which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defensive leagues; nor, perhaps, by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which divine providence has effected it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the English con∣stitution; this has firmly united the strength of the two islands; whereby reciprocal succour, in time of need, is insured to both.</P></NOTE> But as it does not appear
<PB N="15" REF="013613_0014_0F905BE2517FBC80"/>
that the Parliament of Ireland ever acknowledged or gave any formal assent to the said act, the same

And yet, howsoever distinct these several parts or provinces may seem, in point of situation, as well as in the exercise of a separate legislative power for each, (which constitutional right they have en∣joyed beyond the memory of man) they are never∣theless firmly united by the circle of the British diadem, so as to form one vast empire, which will never be divided, if the safe and honest policy be adopted of maintaining the British constitution inviolate, in all parts of the empire; for it is a sys∣tem so natural, so beneficial, and so engaging, to the generality of mankind, that by the same means we might hold the empire of the world, were the laws of natural equity, justice, and liberty, to be strictly observed, and the abomination of domestic<NOTE N="(25)" PLACE="foot"><HI>The toleration of domestic slavery in the Colo∣nies greatly weakens the claim or natural right of our American brethren to liberty.
