<BIBL>Ist. Epistle C O R. 6th Chap. 9, 10, 11, verses.</BIBL>
<Q>Know ye not that the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves with Man∣kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God.—And such were some of you: But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle Paul was, through the blessing of God, instrumental of do∣ing great things at Corinth. It a∣bounded in wealth, and this furnished the means for all kinds of luxury; and most heinous and detestable vices were very prevalent among them. The Apostle, who was zealously set for the promoting the cause of his beloved Lord and Master, came to this city, being encouraged by a vision he had, assuring him that God <HI>had much people in that city,</HI> Acts 18. 9, 10. When he came, as infamous as they were for vice, yet it is likely, that he met with good accep∣tance among them, and accordingly he made a con∣siderable tarry <HI>a year and six months teaching the word of God among them,</HI> as in the verse following.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011707_0004_0F881EB09EBA6CB0"/>
By his great pains and labours, he was instrumen∣tal of founding a church of Christ in that wicked place, and bringing about a great reformation in it. Indeed, notwithstanding all he did, there were yet many things amiss among them, for which he takes occasion in the run of this epistle to reprove them.</P>
<P>In the chapter in which is our text, as well as the preceeding, he warns them against divers heinous sins—<HI>hypocrisy, fornication, idolatry, covetousness, railery, drunkenness, extortion, prosecuting others needlesly and vexatiously in the law..</HI> With respect to some among them, these vices were still indulged, notwithstanding they were directly opposite to the spirit of christianity, which he had been preaching among them, and inculcating upon them. To en∣force the warning he had given against these vices, he adds as in the words I at first read.—<HI>Know ye not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the king∣dom of God?</HI> And then he immediately enumer∣ates divers great and most heinous iniquities, the in∣dulgence of which would effectually exclude them the kingdom of God.—The heavenly kingdom, or the kingdom of glory, which God has prepared for the righteous, and into which their gracious spirits ascend in the day of death, and into which Jesus Christ will publickly invite them in their whole man, at the last day, saying unto them—<HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</HI> Matt. 25. 34—This is the kingdom that the apostle intends, when he tells the Corinthians, that <HI>the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</HI> By the caveat, the apostle enters here, it looks as though there were some among them, at least, who imagined, that not∣withstanding
<PB N="7" REF="011707_0005_0F881EB15ECB9B20"/>
their indulging to such iniquities, yet that on the whole they should inherit that kingdom. But, says he, <HI>be not deceived,</HI> do not flatter yourselves in this matter, do not entertain a thought of going to the kingdom of heaven, if you live in unrighte∣ousness, or in any of these instances of unrighteous∣ness, <HI>fornication, idolatry, adultery,</HI> &amp;c. It is the grandest delusion and self-deception that can be, to entertain the least thought or expectation of being admitted to so glorious a happiness, at the close of an unrighteous, ungodly life. Before I proceed any further, I would remark here—That it is no un∣common thing, for unrighteous persons to deceive themselves, that they shall on the whole inherit the kingdom of God; though they indulge themselves in the most heinous and detestable abominations, such as are enumerated in our text, they flatter them∣selves, that they shall be happy at last. With re∣spect to some indeed, God is not in all their tho'ts; and the same may be said, with respect to a state of future rewards and punishments. These great re∣alities are banished far away from their minds.</P>
<P>But others may at times have some thoughts of God, and of heaven and hell. And yet notwith∣standing by their heinous vices, they are <HI>treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath,</HI> posting head∣long to destruction. Yet such is their amazing stupidity, that they entertain a hope, that it shall be well with them upon the whole, that they shall go to that heavenly kingdom which God has prepared and promised to the righteous. And wherefore is it, that they entertain such a hope? Why, it is partly owing to this, that they imagine that God takes no notice of their conduct and behaviour, or that
<PB N="8" REF="011707_0006_0F881EB21EC87288"/>
he connives at it, so making him altogether such an one as themselves. And partly, because they ima∣gine that God is made up wholly of mercy, and that therefore, he will not at last find it in his heart to punish them; that he will set aside his justice, and dispense with the threatnings which he has de∣nounced against the wicked, especially as there is an alsufficient Saviour of his own providing, and a sufficiency of merit in his blood to pardon and save them; and considering also, that he is rea∣dy to pardon sinners, and that many great and high-handed sinners have been the subjects of his pardoning mercy. The self-deception of sinners, chargeable oftentimes with most heinous and atro∣cious crimes, is no doubt, in a great many instances, grounded upon such imaginations as these.</P>
<P>But that these are vain imaginations, is obvious at the very first glance.—I might show at large, would the time admit of it, that God is absolutely and ne∣cessarily omniscient, and consequently that every being and every thing, throughout the whole uni∣verse, is naked and open to his view; and particu∣larly, that he has a most exact and critical know∣ledge, without the least mistake, or indeed possibility of it, of men and all their thoughts, words and actions. You may, at your leisure, see in confir∣mation of what I have now said, the 139th Psalm, at the beginning.—I might show also that God be∣ing infinitely and immutably holy, cannot possibly connive at sin, the least sin, for this would be to connive at that which directly strikes at his glorious crown and dignity, that pours contempt upon his authority and law, and upon all his adorable attri∣butes. Sin is directly opposite to his nature, law
<PB N="9" REF="011707_0007_0F881EB2DEB8FD80"/>
and government. And what sort of idea must we entertain of God, if we should suppose that he in the least connived at it, or was indifferent about it? Verily that is a clear dictate of reason as well as of the Bible that <HI>he is of purer eyes than to behold ini∣quity.</HI>—And further, although it is true, that God is infinite in mercy, and has given the most glorious proofs and evidences hereof to mankind, yet it is true also, that he is infinite in his justice, and that this stands upon the rights of his throne, and for the maintenance of his righteous authority and his holy law, inviolate. This is abundantly evident, in the whole of that great affair <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>In the death and sacrifice of that glorious person, we have a most striking proof of the strict regard God had for the honor of his justice, and this at the same time that his mercy had the most shining, il∣lustrious display; mercy for ever to be admir'd and ador'd by saints and angels. Mercy rejoic'd against judgment in providing such a glorious Saviour, as the Lord Jesus Christ is, and so putting sinners in a capacity of being saved; yet it is a vain imagination for any sinners to think, that God will set aside his justice, and suffer the glory of this perfection to be eclipsed, so as that they shall be the subjects of his mercy either here or hereafter, they continuing in their unrighteousness, counteracting his law and go∣vernment, by their vicious practices. And so I may say further, that Christ is a mighty redeemer, able to save to the uttermost, yet <HI>he gave himself,</HI> or offered himself in sacrifice, that he might redeem sinners <HI>from</HI> their sins, from the power, pollution and guilt of sin, as well as from the penal effects of it.
<PB N="10" REF="011707_0008_0F881EB39EB6BF48"/>
Consequently then, they can have no benefit by his death and sacrifice, if they are not redeemed from iniquity, in the manner now said. And certainly, they are not thus redeemed, if they live in the practice of iniquity. Nothing can be more plain than this.—And I will only add in a word here—That sinners that have obtained mercy from God, and looked for his mercy unto eternal life, have ob∣tained it, not as hardned sinners, bent upon their ungodly practices, but as qualified subjects of it, receiving the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, and the sanctification of the holy Spirit. So that with∣out further enlarging here—It is with good reason, that the apostle declares in our text, that <HI>the unrigh∣teous shall not inherit the kingdom of God,</HI> and ac∣cordingly enters a caution to all unrighteous ones, and especially those he here enumerates, against self-deception: <HI>Be not deceived,</HI> for no unrighteous per∣son shall inherit the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now here let me ask, what it is that gives a title to the kingdom of God? Verily, not any thing in the creature; for in himself he is utterly unworthy. The most improved christian, has no title to heaven, and the blessedness of it, upon the foundation of his own personal righteousness. If he attains to ever so high degrees in holiness and righteousness, yet after all he is an unprofitable servant. Let him be as eminent a christian as was the apostle Paul, yet he has no claim upon God, and may not pretend to any title to heavenly happiness. Considering the imper∣fection of personal righteousness in the very best, it is impossible, according to the constitution of God's moral government, that such a righteousness can give a title to the heavenly kingdom. The truth
<PB N="11" REF="011707_0009_0F881EB45EBFDB50"/>
is, that nothing short of the perfect righteousness of our blessed Saviour, which is imputed to the real christian, can give a title to the heavenly kingdom and glory.</P>
<P>The proof of this, I might go on abundantly to confirm, were it necessary at present. Now then, what shall we say of the unrighteous? What title can they pretend to the heavenly kingdom, when they are, not only without the imputed righteousness of Christ, but have not so much as a personal righ∣teousness to produce and plead in the case? They are without God and without Christ in the world. What title then can they have to the kingdom of heaven? And what an absurd thing must it be in such, to entertain the least expectation of finally being admitted thereinto? The impossibility of their being so, at once appears from the bare mentioning of the case. I would ask further—What it is that gives a meetness for that kingdom? God that dwelleth there is holy; angels are holy; all the inhabitants of it are holy; the exercises and employments thereof are all holy; and, as it is written, <HI>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord,</HI> Heb. 12. 14. Unholy ones are utterly un∣like the holy God: There is as much contrariety in their natures, to the nature of God, as there is between light and darkness: <HI>And what communion hath light with darkness?</HI> An unholy person, could we suppose that such an one could be admitted to heaven at last, could have no true enjoyment of the holy God. For likeness to God is essentially necessary, in order to the enjoyment of God. Being unholy, a creature could have no taste or relish for the fellowship and society of holy angels,
<PB N="12" REF="011707_0010_0F881EB51EC8C878"/>
or for their exercises and employments. Heaven, t o unholy ones, would be a confinement to them, and they would even wish they were out of it, there being such an utter unlikeness to every thing there, such an utter disrelish to every object and every exercise there. If now upon the whole here, unrighteous, unholy ones, have no meetness or fit∣ness for the heavenly kingdom, what wretched self-deception is it in such, to entertain the least thought or expectation of at last being received thereinto? And were they to consider what heaven is, the objects, the society, the employments and enjoy∣ments of it, it seems as though none of this character, and while continuing in this state, could entertain the least thought of going there at last. But they have, it is likely in many instances, carnal notions of it, as though it was nothing more than a fine splendid city, furnished with objects adapted to gratify the animal senses, having no higher ideas of it, than of a mahometan paradise. But let their imaginations be what they will▪ let their expectations of attaining to it be ever so sanguine, yet it may be depended upon, if any dependance may be placed upon what the apostle declares in our text, that <HI>such shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now something more is intended by the apostle in this declaration, than is expressed. He intends not only that they shall be excluded the kingdom of glory, but that they shall be doomed to the king∣dom of darkness. This will unavoidably be their case. Abundance of passages in the book of God might be produced were there need of it, which fully declare that the unrighteous shall at last be shut up in the prison of hell. And there they will endure
<PB N="13" REF="011707_0011_0F881EB5DEAF7800"/>
the wrath of God, yea, the exceeding fierceness of the wrath of almighty God, through a long eternity. There they will be companions with devils, who now entice them and hurry them on in wickedness, with the malicious view of bringing them to their place of torments. There they will, as do the de∣vils, blaspheme the God of heaven, and gnaw their tongues for pain, without the least respite, the least gleam of hope, or ray of light. When millions of millions of ages are rolled away, in which they have been grapling and conflicting with the exceeding fierceness of the wrath of omnipotent God, still there is a long, boundless eternity before them, and they are no nearer to an end of their torments, than the very moment they entred upon them. This will be the miserable condition at last of the unrigh∣teous. It is impossible to describe, or even to con∣ceive a ten thousandth part of their future misera∣bleness and wretchedness in the bottomless pit; and this, notwithstanding all the solemn and striking re∣presentations we have of it in the word of God.—<HI>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even accord∣ing to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</HI> It exceeds all the most fearful apprehensions, that may at any time be entertained of it. This wrath is most assuredly com∣ing upon all the children of disobedience. God will come at last to shew his wrath and make his power known, in the sight of all intelligencies, upon such vessels of wrath, as have fitted themselves for destruction. All those heinous sinners the apostle mentions in our text, <HI>fornicators, adulterers, thieves, drunkards,</HI> &amp;c. shall have their portion at last in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. Not a single one shall escape, however any may flatter themselves now that they shall do so.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011707_0012_0F881EB69EB04AF0"/>
I would just observe here—That there are many, who, though they may not stand chargeable with such gross open iniquities as the text leads us to consider, yet, properly come under the character of the unrighteous. Although their outward con∣duct may be decent before men, yea although in many instances, they may practise the forms of god∣liness, yet they are without the power of it; they have a name to live, but are dead, under the power of carnal minds that are enmity against God, false and hypocritical in all their transactions with him, have never had any real, thorough sense of sin, nor godly mourning for it. In short, their hearts are estranged from God, they are earthly and sensual in their dispositions and affections. Such as these, though they may make a goodly appearance before the world, are yet in the sight of the holy and heart-searching God, <HI>unrighteous.</HI> And with respect to these also it may be said, that they shall not inherit the kingdom of God. No unclean, unholy thing shall enter there. <HI>All unrighteousness is sin,</HI> says the apostle, 1 John 5. 17. This takes in those, that I have now mentioned. And as it is else∣where said, <HI>Sin is the transgression of the law,</HI> eternal death is the penalty annexed to this law. And this penalty will be inflicted upon all the unrighteous at last. All these things stand in close connection with each other. And accordingly, <HI>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,</HI> Rom. 1. 18. Against <HI>all</HI> unrighteousness, whether secret or open. And far be it from any to fix the charge of cruelty upon God, in inflicting his everlasting wrath upon unrigh∣teous, ungodly ones. For it will not be a mere act of power▪ but he will proceed upon the rules of strict
<PB N="15" REF="011707_0013_0F881EB75ED259B0"/>
justice. Unrighteous ones are enemies against his great and sacred majesty, they do the abominable thing which his soul hates; they counteract his au∣thority and holy law, and virtually bid him defiance. They break through the most sacred ties of grati∣tude, for his abundant goodness and grace towards them, especially in that marvellous instance of it, his sending his only-begotten son to redeem them by the blood of his cross. They rebel both against the light of nature and the light of divine revelation, and take part with the grand enemy of God, and of all righteousness.</P>
<P>What monstrous vileness now is it, to act such a part towards the adorable majesty of heaven and earth, who is so infinitely excellent, and so infinitely worthy of the highest regards of all intelligent crea∣tures, who are under the strongest obligations to live entirely devoted to his service and glory! Can it then be otherwise, but that he must behold the un∣righteous, wicked conduct of his creatures, with the highest anger and resentment? And must he not in honour to his great name, for the establishment of his throne, the magnifying his law, and for the asserting and vindicating his holiness, justice and truth, manifest his anger and resentment towards them? Must he not on the whole, punish them ac∣cording to their deserts? And considering his in∣finite majesty and dignity, must he not everlastingly punish them? It is certain that sin is an infinite evil, if we consider the object against whom it is com∣mitted, the infinite God, and it deserves an infinite punishment. And although according to the diffe∣rent aggravations of men's wickedness, there will be different degrees of punishment in hell, [<HI>with some,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="011707_0014_0F881EB81EBCBA88"/>
we read <HI>it will be more tolerable than with others,</HI> Matt. 11. 24.] yet as to the duration of it, it will be alike as to all; <HI>an everlasting destruction from God's presence, and the glory of his power.</HI> This will be inflicted at last <HI>upon all that know not God, and who have not obeyed the gospel of his son.</HI> And there will be no unrighteousness in God, but he and his throne will be pure and guiltless. And poor, miserable sinners, in the place of torment will be constrained to own the equity and righteousness of God, in inflicting his insupportable and everlasting wrath upon them.</P>
<P>I will only say in a word here, when the apostle declares in our text, that the <HI>unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God,</HI> he is to be under∣stood, as intending those that continue in their un∣righteousness to the last. Not but that there have been many unrighteous ones, who have indulged themselves in the most heinous vices, such as the apostle makes mention of, who have experienced a blessed change both of state and nature, and so from being children of wrath and heirs of hell, have be∣come the children of God, and heirs to the heavenly kingdom, and in their spirits have been put into possession of their inheritance, when they have been dismissed hence by death.</P>
<P>And this leads me now to discourse upon the latter part of our text.—<HI>And such were some of you.</HI> Such heinous transgressors as I have mention∣ed, some of you have been. The word in the ori∣ginal, is emphatical—<HI>such things</HI> were some of you, such wretched, monstrous creatures, who by the indulgence of such detestable abominations, degraded
<PB N="17" REF="011707_0015_0F881EB8DEB1E130"/>
yourselves below the beasts that perish. Notwith∣standing which ye shall inherit the kingdom of God. And why? Because <HI>ye are washed, sanctified, justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.</HI></P>
<P>I might now enter into a large field, in treating up∣on those great and inestimable blessings here spoken of. But the time will only allow me to discourse upon them in a summary way.</P>
<P>When the apostle tells the Corinthians, who had been abominably vile and ungodly,—<HI>ye are washed,</HI> he intends something more than their having been baptized into the christian name by the washing of water. He intends their having been regenerated. This, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> regeneration, is spoken of as a <HI>washing.</HI> So we read Titus 3. 4. of <HI>the washing of regeneration.</HI> And being regenerated, they were accordingly, as he goes on to speak, <HI>sanctified and justified.</HI> "Here" (as one observes) "is a rhetorical change of the natural order: Sanctification is mentioned before justifica∣tion." They are in their nature different; but considering their close connection, we need not be critical here.</P>
<P>Justification is a forensic term, or a term borrowed from courts of justice. When the apostle tells the Corinthians, <HI>they were justified,</HI> he intends in general, that they were acquitted from guilt, pardoned by God, the father of mercies, the lawgiver and judge of mankind, even as criminals and malefactors some∣times have been, by their gracious sovereign's rever∣sing the sentence of condemnation they were under for the violation of the laws, the guilt thereby contracted, and the penalty incurred. Justified persons are dis∣charged
<PB N="18" REF="011707_0016_0F881EB99EABD650"/>
from their guilt, the justice of God has no demands upon them. Their sins are blotted out. God hides his face from them, and remembers them not against them, however numerous they have been, and though of a scarlet and crimson colour. He receives them to favour, and looks upon them as <HI>righ∣teous;</HI> for so they are in a legal sense. "Gospel-justification", (as one observes) <Q>doth not barely take off the guilt of sin and reverse the sentence of condemnation by a pardon, and so restore us to a state of probation which might issue in a state of condemnation again; it likewise pronounces us righteous, and brings us into a state of present and personal acceptance with God to eternal life, whereby, according to the constitution of the gos∣pel, we have a sure, an actual and abiding claim to it. It brings us into a new and compleat title to life, beyond what man ever had before, and into greater nearness to God, and higher dignities and blessings in his favour and love, than belong∣ed to the first covenant.</Q> <HI>The free gift comes upon us to justification of life,</HI> Rom. 5. 18. <HI>And whom God justifies, them he also glorifies,</HI> chap. 8. 30.</P>
<P>Such a blessed alteration as this was made in the state of some of the Corinthians, who had been a∣bandoned to the most flagitious practices; acquitted from guilt, delivered from condemnation, made righ∣teous, restored to favour and entitled to life. And wherefore was it so? Why, as in the text, it was <HI>in the name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> or for his sake, in virtue of his atonement by the blood of the cross, by which he made peace, put away sin, and brought in an everlasting righteousness. The righteousness of Christ is every way adequate to the demands of
<PB N="19" REF="011707_0017_0F881EBA5EB76740"/>
the law and justice of God. Faith lays hold of this righteousness and it is imputed to the guilty sin∣ner for the justification of life. This is the language of the gospel. And consequently now, I would just observe—It is not owing nor can it be owing, either in whole or in part, to any works of righteousness of the sinner's own, that he is justified before God; but solely to the righteousness of our great Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But now, besides such a happy change of state in the Corinthians, as their being justified, they ex∣perienced also a happy change of nature: <HI>Ye are sanctified.</HI> This, as was hinted before, though differ∣ent from their justification, was and always is in near connection with it. Being sanctified they were brought into a conformity to the holy God, made partakers of a divine nature, all the powers of their souls renewed, and a holy, heavenly turn given to them. In the comprehensive representation of the apostle, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <HI>Being in Christ, they were new creatures, old things were passed away, and all things became new.</HI> Now they were brought to love the blessed God, to love the Lord Jesus Christ, to love the divine law, to hate sin, to mourn for it, to forsake it, and to consecrate themselves to God, to glorify him in their bodies and spirits which are his. Now they were possessed of the spirit of Christ, moulded into the genius of his gospel, and had a pre∣vailing disposition and bent of heart to live soberly, righteously and godly in the world, as the grace of God which bringeth salvation teacheth. This in brief we are to understand by their being <HI>sanctified.</HI> And what a happy and most desirable change was this! They were now conformed to the holy God,
<PB N="20" REF="011707_0018_0F881EBB1EBCD5E0"/>
and the holy Jesus, and brought into a meetness for the high and holy heavens, for the enjoyment of the holy God, for the society of holy angels, and for their holy and sublime exercises and employments.</P>
<P>But now they themselves were not the authors of this sanctification: No, <HI>ye are sanctified by the Spirit of our God.</HI> So we elsewhere read of <HI>the sanctification of the Spirit</HI>—of <HI>the renewing of the holy Ghost.</HI> The blessed Spirit of God, who is the spirit of grace and holiness, he is the author or efficient cause of the sanctification of souls. This is abundantly the language of the inspired oracles. And all christian graces and virtues, are spoken of as <HI>fruits of the spirit:</HI> Forasmuch as he by his gracious influences implants the seeds of them in the heart, causes them to take root there, to spring up and bring forth fruit to the praise and glory of God.</P>
<P>I shall only just add here, that we may with pro∣priety speak of being sanctified, not only by the influence and agency of the Spirit of our God, but of being sanctified <HI>in the name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> or in virtue of his atonement. For it is to be considered, that the Spirit in his sanctifying influences is the pur∣chase of the death of Christ. Had he not offered himself a sacrifice to God, it would have been im∣possible that sinners should ever be recovered to the image of God, or become holy, as well as brought into a state of pardon and justification. Accordingly we read of being <HI>sanctified in Christ Jesus,</HI> 1 Cor. 1. 2. And in the 30th ver. the apostle gives us a com∣prehensive view of the whole of man's redemption, present and future, the whole of it, taking its rise from the mediation of Christ. <HI>But of him, are ye
<PB N="21" REF="011707_0019_0F881EBBDEA882C0"/>
in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have in some measure gone through with the whole of the inspired passage I at first read to discourse upon, upon this sorrowful occasion.</P>
<P>And now from the things that have been spoken, I may take occasion to observe, with what a con∣spicuous and admirable light the wisdom and the grace of God, shines forth in the work of man's re∣demption. A better righteousness than his own is provided, in which he may with safety appear before the holy and righteous God, both here and hereafter: And effectual provision made for his recovery from his pollution and degeneracy and restoration to a state of true rectitude and moral purity. So that notwithstanding his guilt and vileness, he may not only escape future wrath and perdition, but have a sure title to and meetness for celestial glory and hap∣piness. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is all of God, of his contriving and effecting, and how gloriously is his wisdom and his grace displayed and illustrated herein!</P>
<P>Again,—What obligations are we under to Jesus Christ, for undertaking this work, and carrying it into effect! Glorified saints will through eternal ages adore and praise him for his loving them and wash∣ing them from their sins in his own blood, and in raising them to sit together with him in heavenly places. <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to re∣ceive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing,</HI> Rev. 5. 12.</P>
<P>Again,—What praises are due to God, from those who have been made partakers of the great redemp∣tion
<PB N="22" REF="011707_0020_0F881EBC9EA74658"/>
by Jesus Christ; who have obtained the justi∣fication of life, and the sanctification of the Spirit, and so have a sure title to and a proper meetness for the happiness and glory of heaven! Well may the high praises of God be in their mouths for his rich grace and mercy towards them. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be all the glory.</P>
<P>Nextly,—We may hence see, that redeemed ones are the most happy and blessed ones upon the earth. For their sins are blotted out, their guilt pardoned and done away. Being in Christ, no condemnation belongs to them. They have on them the image of God. And God is a Father to them, and loves them as dear children, has provided a glorious in∣heritance for them in the highest heavens, and will by and by put them into the full and everlast∣ing possession of it. What are all the pomps and splenders of the world, all its wealth, honours and pleasures, in compare with all this? Verily no more than the common pebbles to the most brilliant dia∣monds, or the lonely cottage of the beggar, to the magnificent palaces of princes and nobles.</P>
<P>Lastly,—We may hence see, that the vilest sin∣ners, may obtain the richest spiritual blessings, such as we have been speaking of, the justification of life, and the sanctification of the Spirit, and as the issue of all, eternal glorification in heaven.—</P>
<P>We have an example of this in some among the Corinthians. Notwithstanding their monstrous and most detestable vices, which exposed them to the damnation of hell, and which would have irrecover∣ably sunk them down into it, had a provoked God wholly departed from them and given them up, yet
<PB N="23" REF="011707_0021_0F881EBD5EBEDD68"/>
they were justified and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, and so brought to share in the glorious redemption by Christ both present and future. So that we may never despair of the most heinous sinners, if they are as infamous, as some of the Corinthians were that are spoken of in our text, of their being brought home to God and obtaining salvation. Nor may sinners themselves, let them have ever so afflicting, pungent a sense of their guilt, their misery and ill-deserts, despair hereof, since thus it has been with others. The merits of Christ's precious blood, and the vital influences of the blessed Spirit can as effectu∣ally reach them, as the abominable Corinthians or any other the most atrocious sinners. And in this case they will be delivered from the lowest hell, and be among the number of the redeemed of the Lord in the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P>I have chosen the subject I have been discoursing upon, mainly with a view to your instruction and benefit, <HI>poor man!</HI> who art under a sentence of con∣demnation, this day to be executed upon you. We have called this solemn assembly, that you might once more before you die, have the opportu∣nity of having public, fervent prayers offered up to God on your behalf; and receiving instruction and counsel in those things which concern your everlast∣ing well-being. While you have attended the pub∣lic worship of God, since your condemnation, very solemn and weighty have been the instructions and counsels you have received, and so they have been in a more private manner: And frequent and fervent supplications have been offered up to the God of heaven for mercy to your precious
<PB N="24" REF="011707_0022_0F881EBE1EB59A50"/>
and immortal soul. You have had a considerable space since your condemnation to prepare for this solemn day, and for the solemn hour of death just before you. And as this is the last op∣portunity you will ever have to attend to the public instructions of God's word, see that you give a dili∣gent and earnest heed to what may be now spoken to you in the name of the Lord.—</P>
<P>I would be far from upbraiding you with your wickedness: However, from the crime you have been convicted of, and for which you have been sen∣tenced to die, you must be very sensible that your character is pointed out in the black catalogue of sinners mentioned in my text. Among other atro∣cious sinners, who shall not inherit the kingdom of God, the apostle mentions <HI>thieves.</HI> And were you chargeable with no other crime than that of theft, this alone would be sufficient to exclude you the kingdom of God. For this is a direct breach of an express commandment of God. <HI>Thou shalt not steal,</HI> Exod. 20. 15. And only the violation of this com∣mandment is an argument of rebellion against the Lord, a despising his authority and his law, and there is an infinite evil in it, and it deserves an infinite punishment. You have had solemn warnings a∣gainst this vice, in the public punishments you have been brought to; but you presumed to go on not∣withstanding, hardning your self against God and his law, and the laws of man, as though you could prosper. You have disregarded God and his threat∣nings, and the judgment to come. You forsook God, and God forsook you. You would have none of God, and so he gave you up unto your own heart's lusts, and to walk in your own counsels. And what is the dismal effect of it? Why, you have
<PB N="25" REF="011707_0023_0F881EBEDEA1CFE8"/>
been brought before the tribunal of man, and have been sentenced to die before the time. And the so∣lemn day is now come—and preparation is made for your execution. The grave has opened its mouth to receive you, and you will presently be laid in it, while your spirit shall go to the world of spirits.—You are now hovering upon the brink of eternity, and will presently be in it. O what an awful situa∣tion is this! But yet though the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, and you must be sen∣sible that you are deserving of it, yet through the riches of God's grace in Christ, you may escape it, and be received to the kingdom of glory. And if you are interested in the righteousness of Christ, and renewed and sanctified by the blessed Spirit, you may die in the firm faith and hope of being so.—And let me tell you, that if you are in a justified, sanctified state, you have been awakned to see your wretched, guilty, miserable condition as a sinner, been led to see what an evil and bit∣ter thing sin is, not merely as you have exposed yourself to the sword of civil justice, and to the everlasting wrath of God; but principally, because you have acted a vile, rebellious, ungrateful part towards the glorious Majesty of heaven, who in numberless instances has been good and kind and merciful to you; and your heart is broken and contrite on account hereof: And you have been brought to see that you are without help and strength in yourself, that you have nothing to recommend you to God, and that he might justly make you a monument of his everlasting wrath, because of your heinous wickedness; but yet that there is hope for you—that there is a glorious ful∣ness
<PB N="26" REF="011707_0024_0F881EBF9EA55258"/>
in Christ.—You have been led to believe in him as an alsufficient Saviour, and to embrace him as the Lord your righteousness, and to trust your whole soul upon his infinite merits. And there∣fore have found a great and mighty change of heart; that you esteem and love the blessed God supremely and for his own incomparable excellencies as well as benefits—that Christ is precious to your soul, that you love the law of God, and that sin which is opposite to it is most hateful to you—that you heartily bow to God and have a supreme re∣gard to his glory, and fervent charity towards men, and that after all you freely acknowledge yourself an unprofitable servant, and look for eternal life as the free gift of God, of his rich and glorious grace through Jesus Christ the only mediator between God and man.</P>
<P>It is no proper season for any one to flatter you, or for you to flatter yourself. Your eternal all de∣pends upon your finding matters thus with you, as I have now said. Look critically and thoroughly and impartially into yourself, and see how it is with you. It is an awful thing for any one, especially▪ at the last, as is the cafe with you, to deceive him∣self, and think he is something, when he is nothing, from high hopes of heaven, to find himself at death, sinking down into the lowest hell. A mistake here is irreparable.</P>
<P>It is our hearts desire and prayer to God, that though you must die this day an ignominious death, yet that you may die in a state of favour with God, interested in the precious merits of the blessed Jesus, and that you may have the comfortable,
<PB N="27" REF="011707_0025_0F881EC05EACEF90"/>
substantial evidences hereof, and that your soul may go to be at rest with God, and be joined this day to the society of saints and angels in the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P>Now that you are about retiring from this place, and will have a few moments left you, prostrate yourself before the throne of God's mercy, spread your sins and distresses before him; cry to him with im∣portunity, for the exercise of his mercy towards you, that he would shine into your soul with the light of his blessed countenance, and enable you to meet death with all the solemn circumstances attending it, with a holy courage, and that in the fatal mo∣ment you may with a firm faith resign your im∣mortal spirit into the hands of the blessed Jesus, saying with Stephen, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my spirit.</HI></P>
<P>So now, on the whole, we earnestly recommend you to the grace of God and to the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, even unto eternal life.</P>
<P>And now, Brethren! We may here see the bit∣ter fruits and effects of indulged wickedness.—Overmuch wickedness tends to an immature death, sometimes by the sword of civil justice being drawn upon the committers of it, as in the instance before us, and in the instance we had in this place but a∣bout two years ago, as well as in other instances; and partly also as many vices tend by a natural causality to shorten men's days upon earth. But then this is not the worst of it, for it tends to eter∣nal death and destruction, as has been shown in the preceeding discourse. O then, how ought every one, young and old, to take warning by the exam∣ples of others, and shun the paths of vice, and of
<PB N="28" REF="011707_0026_0F881EC11EB3F858"/>
the destroyer! Let every sinner immediately repent and turn to God, and fly to Jesus who saves from sin, and delivers from the wrath to come; and henceforth live soberly, righteously and godly in the world, that so he may be happy in the favour of God here, and at last be received to the kingdom of glory. And O that all Israel may hear and fear and do no more so wickedly!</P>
<P>And in a word—May all that attend the execu∣tion of this poor man, lift up their hearts in fervent prayer for him, that God would display the riches of his grace in his everlasting salvation. And may the minds of all present here and in this place this day, solemnized upon such an affecting occasion; avoid every thing that is rude and disorderly, retire home in proper season, and take occasion to bless God for the restraints of his grace, and sensible of their weakness and liableness to temptations, seek for the guidance of his good Spirit in the way of duty, and that they may be kept from falling, and be preserved by the mighty power of God, through faith unto salvation. May it be thus with every one of us, through the riches of God's grace in Christ Jesus! to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost be all honour, power and glory, now and forevermore!</P>
