<P>THE conversion and salvation of a lost sin∣ner, may justly be reckoned among the wonderful works of God to the children of men. And sometimes such circum∣stances attend the work, which greatly serve to increase the wonder. Such an instance we have presented to view in the text before us.</P>
<P>Here is a wretched sinner come to the brink of the grave, and the eternal world; in the broad way to hell.</P>
<P>That this was his case, is evident from what St. Matthew and Mark relate of him. Matthew
<PB N="4" REF="012725_0004_0F8BC251A2CF6468"/>
says, that when the chief priests, mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, he saved others himself he cannot save: it he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also (not one only, but both) which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 27.41, 42, 43, 44.</NOTE> They join∣ed with those who mocked the Son of God in the agonies of death. Mark says, and they that were crucified with him reviled him.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark 15.32.</NOTE> And in as much as revilers shall not inherit the kingdom of God,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 6.10.</NOTE> we may safely conclude, that he was still in the way to destruction.</P>
<P>But, behold! all on a sudden, he is apprehend∣ed by sovereign and all-powerful grace! he is con∣vinced, and humbled▪ believes and repents. He prays, and in answer to his prayer, receives a gracious promise from Christ, of a sudden transi∣tion to the paradise of God!</P>
<P>With respect to this thief, the following parti∣culars are observable.</P>
<P N="1">I. His conviction and humiliation. How∣ever proof he might heretofore have been against convictions, now, at the very last period of his wretched life, the arrows of God penetrate his stoney heart; the law of God is set home up∣on his conscience; with a convincing power and light, his eyes are opened to see his sins, and the wrath of God to which his sins had rendered him obnoxious; his conscience is thoroughly a∣wakened, and he is in the utmost distress, to know, what he must do to be saved from that wrath,
<PB N="5" REF="012725_0005_0F8BC2523B815E30"/>
which he now sees just ready to fall on his guilty soul.—And his eyes are opened, not only to see the awful state that his sins had brought him into, but also, that his present sufferings, and whatever he might hereafter suffer, are but a just reward of his sins: which discovery is absolutely necessary in order to true humiliation. For unless the sin∣ner sees the justness of his punishment, he never will be humble under it.</P>
<P>And that this was the case with this malefac∣tor, is evident from what the evangelist Luke relates of him in the chapter before us. For we read, that when the other malefactor, railed against Christ, this penitent thief rebuked him, saying, dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation; and we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man (that is Christ) hath done nothing amiss.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Context▪ ver. 40, 41.</NOTE>— He fully confesses his own sin and guilt, and that the sentence of death he was now under, was just. He also asserts the innocence of the suffering Saviour of the world: which are convincing proofs that his conviction and humiliation were genuine, and that he was a sit object of divine compassion.</P>
<P N="2">II. His faith and repentance.</P>
<P>He believes him whom he now saw in the ago∣nies of a shameful death, to be the Lord of life. That he was a King, and had a kingdom: That crowns and kingdoms were at his dipose:—That he was able to save him from eternal death. To suppose the contrary, would be to make his prayer a piece of down-right idolatry, and not an act of religious worship.</P>
<P>And if we consider the state and condition that Christ was in, at that time when he believed; his
<PB N="6" REF="012725_0006_0F8BC2548CA941B8"/>
faith will appear the more wonderful. The Son of righteousness now suffered a very great eclipse, the glory of his Godhead was greatly obscur'd by his sufferings: he was in the very depth of his humiliation; he was now under an unjust sentence of death, and is numbered with transgressors, to undergo the pains of a shameful death, and was now in the very agonies of it: now it was that his Father hid his face from him, and put the bitter cup of his wrath into his hand, which he must needs drink up.</P>
<P>The sufferings of Christ at this time were such, that the faith of his disciples was greatly stagger∣ed: One had betrayed him, another had denied him; and all had forsook him, and fled.—But notwithstanding all these disadvantages, this penitent thief, by faith saw him to be the only Sa∣viour of perishing sinners, that he was able to save him in particular, and that there was no other shelter to which he could fly, and be safe from the storm of God's anger.—And by faith, he lay'd hold on him, as the only hope set before him; and through faith in the suffering Saviour, he obtain∣ed the forgivness of all his sins, and an inheritance among the saints; as is evident from Christ's gra∣cious promise to him. To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</P>
<P>And he not only believes on Christ, but also repents; his repentance was not meerly legal, but evangelical. However strongly he heretofore had been attached to sin, he now sees the infinite moral evil of it, and loathing it in his heart, turns from it to God with self abhorrence.</P>
<P N="3">III. His prayer.</P>
<P>An unconverted man <HI>may</HI> pray; but a con∣verted man <HI>will</HI> pray. Prayer is the breath of the
<PB N="7" REF="012725_0007_0F8BC2553919F738"/>
new-born soul. Soon after Saul the persecutor was converted; it was said of him, behold he prayeth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 9.11.</NOTE></P>
<P>This thief is no sooner converted, but he in∣stantly falls to prayer. Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom, q. d. When thou art enthron'd at the right-hand of thy Father; and partakest of the glory, which thou hadst with him, before the world was; when thou art in full possession of thy mediatorial kingdom, for the carrying on the work of sinful man's redemp∣tion; then remember me. Let me have a part in thy intercession with the Father in behalf of perishing sinners: let thy precious blood, be sprinkled upon my guilty and polluted soul, that thereby I may be absolved from my guilt, and thoroughly washed from my filth. That when I leave this world, which I must instantly do, and enter upon eternity, I may come to thee, and dwell forever with thee in thy kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The gracious promise which he received from Christ in answer to his prayer: To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</P>
<P>Although it is impossible that sinners should merit any thing from God by their prayers; yet, by his institution, it is a means of grace, for them to be in the use of, for the obtaining of those favors which he most freely bestows upon perishing sin∣ners.</P>
<P>This penitent sinner prayed to Christ to remem∣ber him when he came into his kingdom; and Christ makes a promise to him, of the greatest good he was capable of receiving To be forever with Christ in his kingdom, and to be glorified to∣gether with him, is the greatest honor, and the
<PB N="8" REF="012725_0008_0F8BC255FA4C2608"/>
greatest happiness our nature is capable of re∣ceiving.</P>
<P>If we would see the exceeding preciousness of the promise, made to this condemned malefactor, we must consider, (1.) The time when it was made: it was, when he was instantly to leave the world, and enter upon eternity; where his state must be fixed, and remain unalterable forever. (2.) When all the sins of his past vicious life stared him in the face, and he saw himself justly exposed to everlasting punishment. Oh! what a support and comfort must this gracious promise be to his distressed soul: the seasonableness of the promise adds to its sweetness. (3.) That it was speedily to be fulfilled; his faith, hope, and pati∣ence, were not to be long exercised in waiting for the accomplishment of it. The promise was made and fulfilled the same day: To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. A blessed change indeed, to go from earth to heaven, from the company of mortal men, to be in company with Christ, holy angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect; from the pains of death, to inherit eternal life; from the shame of an accursed death, to wear a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>The APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>And 1. A word by way of caution. Let none be encouraged from the example of this thief's finding mercy at the very last, to put off their re∣pentance, and turning to God, until they come to die. The extraordinary and miraculous conver∣sion of the thief on the cross, is not left on record, that we should make such an improvement of it. For, as we received all from God, it is highly reasonable, that all our time and strength should
<PB N="9" REF="012725_0009_0F8BC257345F16D8"/>
be employed in his service: we have no time to throw away in the service of the world, the flesh, and the devil.</P>
<P>God calls upon sinners to remember him in the days of their youth: and there is a promise, that those that seek him early shall find him. Christ enjoins it as a duty incumbent upon all, to seek first the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness thereof: and therefore it highly concerns every sinner speedily to forsake his sins, and turn to God. He that puts off his repentance for the pre∣sent, is in great danger of loosing his soul. For now is the time that God calls upon sinners to repent, and offers them his holy Spirit to assist them in the difficult work: nor have sinners any assurance that they shall ever have another offer of grace, or an opportunity to turn to God. Be∣hold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of salvation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 6.2</NOTE> To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb 3 7</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, the longer sinners continue in sin, the more hardned their hearts are through the deceit∣fulness of it. The longer the work of conversion is put off, the greater will the difficulties be that will attend it.</P>
<P>Nor let any despair of the mercy of God while they have life.</P>
<P>Although God might justly say to every sinner that puts off his repentance until he is in agonies of death, and upon the very brink of hell, and then in his distress cries for mercy: I have called, and ye have refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. I also will laugh at your ca∣lamity,
<PB N="10" REF="012725_0010_0F8BC257C15EA1B8"/>
I will mock when your fear cometh. <NOTE PLACE="foot">Pro. 1.24, 26.</NOTE>Yet such are the bowels of his compassion toward perishing sinners, who in their distress call upon him for mercy; that somtimes he bestows his mercy upon them at the very last: such an in∣stance we have in the text.—Therefore let none despair of mercy, while they have breath to call upon God for it.</P>
<P>An English expositor makes the following judi∣cious observation upon this text. Says he, "The spirit of God foreseeing what an ill use some would make of this instance, leaves <HI>one</HI> example upon record, that none might despair; and <HI>but</HI> one, that none might presume." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Burkit.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. See the sovereignty of God, in bestowing his grace upon this condemned malefactor. Whenever God shews mercy to sinners, he acts as a sovereign, but his sovereignty does more con∣spicously appear in the salvation of some, than it does in the salvation of others; and perhaps in none more than in this wretched sinner.—He had spent his whole life in rebellion against God, and is now brought to the public place of execution, to die by the hand of justice, having by his sin forfeited his life: and although he is now as it were in the very suburbs of hell; can join with those that mocked and reviled the Son of God in his dying agonies. Surely none appears less qual∣lified to receive mercy than he, or less deserving of it.—But while he is in this state, he is appre∣hended by sovereign grace, and mercy triumphs in his salvation.—And what shall we say to these things? Surely he will have mercy on whom he will.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="012725_0011_0F8BC25DA1BE8CC0"/>3. See the efficacious power of divine grace. It is not all the thunder from Mount-Sinai, or the greatest degrees of legal terror a sinner is capable of suffering, that will change his heart. All the law can do, is to convince the sinner of his sins, to awaken his conscience, alarm his fears, and shew him his need of Christ.</P>
<P>But that which the law cannot do, grace can. Oh! what a marvellous change was instantly wrought in this malefactor by the energy of grace! Perhaps the same hour in which he reviled Christ, he becomes a true penitent; freely confessing his sins, acknowledging that he suffered justly, and that Christ suffered unjustly. He now sorrows for sin with a godly sorrow; his sorrow worked re∣pentance to salvation, not to be repented of. He is now become a new creature: old things are past away; behold, all things are become new.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.17.</NOTE>— Sanctifying grace, in a gracious measure, had pu∣rified his heart from sin, and he is able to perform the acts of believing, repenting, and turning to God; which are proper to the new creature only▪ nor is it possible that such an effect should proceed from any other cause. It is grace only, that sub∣dues the corruptions of the heart, and restores the moral image of God to the souls of men. Therefore, what great reason have the sinful chil∣dren of men to be thankful to God, that he should ever condescend to bestow his grace upon any.</P>
<P N="4">4. That if sinners would be partakers of the grace of God, they must seek to him for it thro' a crucified Saviour.</P>
<P>For, although God acts most freely <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bestows his grace upon sinners; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="12" REF="012725_0012_0F8BC25E68B83D78"/>
by all that they can do, to lay him under the least obligation: yet he has appointed the means of grace for sinners to make use of, for the obtaining of grace, which he bestows most freely.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to the plan of the Gospel, and therefore sinners may not neglect the means of grace, because they cannot merit by the use of them. It is evident from the scriptures, that God ordinarily bestows his grace upon sinners when they are using the means prescribed in the gospel for the obtaining of it. Faith cometh by hearing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE></P>
<P>The thief on the cross, as soon as his eyes were opened to see his exposedness to the wrath of God, and that there was no way for him to escape but to fly to the mercy of God in Christ; he instantly betook himself to prayer: Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. It was the only means he could then make use of; the time was past with him for other duties: and he does not neglect that; he poured out his soul in strong cries to Christ, whom he believed was able to save him from eternal death; and he obtained that which he sought after; a promise of resting with Christ after he left the world.</P>
<P>I come now to address myself to the prisoner of death, who stands here before us.</P>
<P>Ah! unhappy man! You are now come al∣most to the very close of a miserable life.—Of late your time has been reckoned by weeks; and since that by days: now it is no longer days but hours: and soon, Oh! very soon, it will be no longer hours, but minutes, you'll have to live in this world; then you must die and enter upon eternity▪</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012725_0013_0F8BC25F2368F100"/>This day God requires your soul of you: You are summoned this day to make your appearance before the judgment-seat of Christ, to give an ac∣count of all the deeds done in the body. Oh therefore now consider before it is too late, what an awful thing it is to appear before the tribunal of the great God: when all the sins of your past life will be set in order before your eyes with all the aggravations that have attended them: That if you are found an impenitent sinner, destitute of faith in Christ, and repentance towards God, you must hear the dreadful sentence, Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire.</P>
<P>St. Paul durst not entertain the least thought of appearing at the bar of God, in any other righte∣ousness than the surety-ship righteousness of Christ; accordingly he expressed his most vehement de∣sire, that he might be found in him, Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righ∣teousness which is of God by faith.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 3.5.</NOTE> Nor is there any other refuge to which you can flee and be safe. And notwithstanding your sins are of a scarlet co∣lour, and of a crimson dye, his blood is sufficient to make atonement for all your sins, and to wash away your filth. God has set him forth to be a propitiatory sacrifice for sin, that through faith in his blood, the vilest sinners might have forgivness.</P>
<P>Oh! how great is the mercy of God to perish∣ing sinners, manifested in his appointing his own Son to be a Mediator between himself and them: through whom there is a new and living way of access opened to the Father▪ in which the greatest sinner (being a true penitent) may come to him for mercy; and through him God bestows his
<PB N="14" REF="012725_0014_0F8BC25FC3B60320"/>
grace on them most freely. What a wonderful declaration is that which the apostle makes,—For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> In Christ there is an infinite ful∣ness of wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. And whosoever believes on him shall partake of all his benefits.</P>
<P>Having pointed out a city of refuge to which you may flee and be safe from the storm of God's wrath: In his name I now call upon you to make your escape unto it.</P>
<P>And may I not with propriety, address you in the language of the angel to Lot,—Escape for thy life.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Not for the life of thy body; that thou mayest not do, that thou can'st not do: but for the life of thy precious soul. Although your body is under a sentence of death not to be revoked, which must be speedily executed: yet there is hope con∣cerning the life of your precious soul. If with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, you confess your sins to God, and lay hold on Christ by faith, (as many and as great as your sins are) you shall find mercy: He will absolve you from all your sins, and justify you freely, by imputing the righ∣teousness of Christ to you: He will receive you to his favor, and give you a place among the blessed. Oh therefore be persuaded instantly to cast yourself upon Christ by faith.</P>
<P>And as motives to excite and stir you up to com∣ply with the exhortation, consider (I.) That you have no time to delay: You are within a few mo¦ments of death and eternity. What is done by way of preparation, must be done quickly: your probationary state will very soon be at an end▪
<PB N="15" REF="012725_0015_0F8BC26097CC5C88"/>
For there is no wisdom nor knowledge in the grave whither thou goest: As death leaves you, the judgment will find you. (2.) The willing∣ness of Christ to receive you upon your coming to him for mercy. He says, Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 6.37.</NOTE> Therefore let your last breath be spent in calling upon him for mercy: Say with the penitent thief. Lord, re∣member me now thou art in thy kingdom; which if you do in faith, you will be intitl'd to the same promise he was. (3.) The great ability of Christ to save you: he is not only willing but able also, to save to the utmost, all that come to him. It is said of him by the prophet Isaiah, That he is mighty to save! <NOTE PLACE="foot">Isa. 68.1.</NOTE>—He has paid the full price of man's redemption. By his active and passive o∣bedience, the law of God is magnified and made honorable, his justice fully satisfied, and the honor of his moral government secured: so that God can be just in justifying the greatest sinner who believeth in Christ. Oh! the infinite efficacy of the blood of Christ! It is an all-sufficient sacrifice of atonement for sin. And there are some of the very chief of sinners, such as Manassah, Mary Magdalene, and a persecuting Saul, who now shine in the kingdom of glory: these and a great multitude besides, which no man can number, were all redeemed to God by that precious blood. Let the consideration of these things encourage you in∣stantly to make your flight to Christ by faith. (4.) Consider what an awful thing it will be for you to appear before the judgment-seat of Christ in an unprepared state. Here you stand a condemned malefactor, filled with all the horrors of a shame∣ful
<PB N="16" REF="012725_0016_0F8BC261406FF040"/>
and painful death. Oh! sad state indeed! But your present distress, however great, is nothing, compared with the horror that your poor soul will be filled with instantly after it leaves the body, if you are found in an unconverted state.—You must be born again, and become a new creature. Pray earnestly to God to give you a heart to re∣pent of all your sins, and that for Christ's sake he would forgive you; that your tongue may sing a∣loud of his righteousness: that he would circum∣cise your heart, to fear his great name, and to love him supremely: that he would give grace to en∣able you to be of a Christ-like temper and dispo∣sition towards all men. O take care you do not leave the world, cherishing enmity in your heart against any man; but forgive all men who have trespassed against you, or you cannot expect for∣givness from God. If you depart this life destitute of these qualifications, you'll fall into the hands of an angry God; who will bring you to his bar to receive the dreadful sentence, Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Oh! and can you bear the thoughts of an everlasting separation from God? To suffer the fierceness of his anger. And as there is none that can save you from the wrath to come but Christ, and he is both able and willing to do it; let me persuade you by the terror of the Lord, to accept of him upon the terms of the gospel. (5.) As a further motive to persuade you to believe, repent, and turn to God in Christ, consider that your repentance will be matter of joy to the an∣gels of God: There is joy in heaven over a re∣penting sinner: yea, Christ himself will rejoice over you. O what a glorious change will be in∣stantly made in your present unhappy condition!
<PB N="17" REF="012725_0017_0F8BC261FA847418"/>
You are now filled with shame, confusion covers you: but notwithstanding, if like the penitent thief on the cross, you betake yourself to Christ; as soon as your soul is separated from the body by death, guardian angels will take charge of it, and convey it safe to heaven; and Christ himself will bid you welcome, saying, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. A glori∣ous change indeed! To be with Christ in his kingdom, and eternally swallowed up in the rap∣tures of redeeming love! May God of his infi∣nite mercy grant that this may be your happy portion for Christ's sake.</P>
<P>I now come to address myself to this very great congregation.</P>
<P>Here is a vast number of people met to∣gether this day, and God and your own conscien∣ces know best what ends you have in view in coming; whether to satisfy your curiosity, or that you might reap some good to yourselves from the heart-affecting scene, that now is presented to your light.</P>
<P>Sure I am, that unless you are much wanting in your duty to God, and your own souls, you may learn various useful lessons from this melan∣choly providence.</P>
<P>And 1. See how much you are indebted to God for the restraints of his grace, that hitherto have been upon you, whereby you have been kept back from those outrageous acts of violence, that have brought others to an untimely death.</P>
<P>I may address you in the language of St. Paul to the Corinthians,—For who maketh thee to dif∣fer from another? And what hast thou that thou
<PB N="18" REF="012725_0018_0F8BC264489EB5F8"/>
didst not receive?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> Yea, who maketh thee to differ from this prisoner of death? Surely, it is the restraining grace of God bestowed upon you, that makes the difference. For had you been left to yourselves, to the government of your irregular passions, you would before this time, have plun∣ged yourselves into the greatest misery. What reason then have you to adore the riches of God's goodness to you, and say, Why me, Lord! Why have I been kept from ruining myself, while o∣thers have been left to do it!—And consider, that it is not sufficient in order to your eternal happi∣ness, that you have restraining grace. By re∣straint a man may be kept back from sinning: but it is sanctifying grace alone that is sufficient to sub∣due the corruptions of the heart, and to bring the sinner from under the dominion of sin. O there∣fore pray earnestly to God for regenerating grace. Say with the psalmist,—Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 19.12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Consider that it is your duty to take warn∣ing by this malefactor: In him you may see in some measure what sin is; that the wages of sin is death. O therefore flee from it, as the greatest of all evils. In particular, let me warn you against those sins which have a natural tendency to lead on the sin of murder.</P>
<P>Be ye therefore warned against the sin of drunk∣enness. Drunkenness is a sin that awfully abounds in our land at this day. This is a very heinous sin in itself, and it is the more so, as it oftentimes leads on to many other sins, and sometimes to the
<PB N="19" REF="012725_0019_0F8BC2650191BBC0"/>
sin of murder. For when men are intoxicated with strong drink, many of them are easily pro∣voked to anger, and being almost as void of reason as the brute beasts, they are easily prevailed upon by the devil, and their own corruptions, to shed innocent blood. O therefore let every drunkard who hears me this day, be persuaded to lay aside the practice of this abominable sin, lest it should bring him to an untimely end.</P>
<P>Be ye also warned against rash anger. When men indulge themselves in giving way to their passions, their anger oftentimes ariseth to an un∣due height, and then they are apt to use threat∣ning language, and from abusive language to proceed to blows, which sometimes prove fatal. Therefore guard against this sin: beg of God to give you grace to overcome all sinful anger; that you may learn of him who is meek and lowly in heart;<NOTE PLACE="foot">Mat. 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> Who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatned not but committed himself to him that judgeth righte∣ously <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.23.</NOTE></P>
<P>I would also warn you against an inordinate love of the world. When mens hearts are sinfully in love with filthy lucre, they are in great danger of being tempted to covet other men's goods; which covetous desires sometimes hurry them on to commit the horrid sins of theft, robbery, and mur∣der. And as those vices awfully prevail in the land, I would the more earnestly exhort you to guard against the snares of the devil. Let your conver∣sation be without covetousness▪ and be content with such things as ye have.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. 13.5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Once more. Let me warn you against fornica∣tion; a sin that greatly abounds among us, to the
<PB N="20" REF="012725_0020_0F8BC265C0424CA8"/>
reproach of christianity. There is a propriety in my cautioning you against this sin, upon this oc∣casion, because it sometimes leads on to the sin of murder; and there have been but too many in∣stances of it in this land; especially among the fe∣male sex: For when they have been prevailed up∣on to give up their chastity, and to commit the obscene act, and shame begins to beset them, then they lye open to the temptations of him who was the first murderer; lay aside the bowels of a mo∣ther, and lay violent hands on their tender offsp∣ring, with a view to hide their shame. Can a wo∣man forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 49.15.</NOTE> O therefore beg of God to keep you from this soul sin when you are tempt∣ed to it. Say with Joseph,—How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?</P>
<P>To conclude. Let me ask your prayers in be∣half of the poor malefactor, who must this day, before the sun sets, launch into the eternal world.</P>
<P>I hope that in this vast assembly there are many praying souls, who have an interest at the throne of grace. You can't but behold him as an ob∣ject of your pity! Nor is there any way open in which you can so effectually bestow your charity upon him, as by unitedly pouring out your souls in strong cries to God for him; that he would shew him mercy now at the very last. And the consideration of the great things which God has done, in answer to the united prayers of his peo∣ple, are sufficient motives to excite you to the performance of this duty.—May God of his in∣finite mercy, for Christ's sake, receive his depart∣ing spirit. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>AS it is expected that the Public will be desirous of knowing some particulars respecting the said <HI>SOLOMON GOODWIN'S</HI> committing the Murder, (for which he was executed on the
<DATE><HI>12</HI>th of <HI>November, 1772</HI></DATE>) the following are here annexed, as related by himself just before his execution.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the difference that ever happened between <HI>David Wilson</HI> and myself was on the 25th of <HI>May,</HI> 1772, and to the best of my judgment between eight and nine o'clock in the afternoon, but being a dark and rainy day I cannot so very well tell the exact time—In the fore-part of the day I happen'd to fall in company with said <HI>Wilson</HI> and one <HI>Stephen Goodwin,</HI> at Capt. <HI>William Swanton's</HI> in <HI>Georgetown,</HI> and we was all homeward bound; said <HI>Wilson</HI> had a canoe and I had none, I asked Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> for a passage, he told me I should be welcome if I would work for it, and then we all set out very loving together.—<HI>Wilson</HI> took the paddle to steer with, and I took the after oar.—We rowed off in the river and went on board a sloop that was bound up said river; the master of the sloop received us kindly, and gave each of us a glass of rum, which we received kindly, and we went up in the sloop three miles and an half, where the sloop came to anchor, and then we was going along, but the master of the vessel told us if we would stop till they had made up their sails, he would give us a drink of toddy; he made half a gallon, and six of us drank it, and then we set out in the canoe as loving as be∣fore, and went about a mile and an half up the river, to Mr▪ <HI>Joseph Macey's,</HI> and went on shore to get some fish, this same house was a tavern, and Mr. <HI>Macey</HI> asked if I would take a drink of flip, I told him I did not care if I did, accordingly he made a mug and five of us drank it, and then <HI>Wilson</HI> ask∣ed for a mug, and we also drank it, and then I said it was time to go home,—<HI>Stephen Goodwin</HI> said he had drank of our liquor, and he would have his mug, I told him it was not worth while, for if he had, I would drink none of it, but he got it made, and went out of the house, and I suppose they did drink it, and then we went away as loving as before, and <HI>Wilson</HI> took his paddle, and I took the after oar, and I set down on the seat facing <HI>Wilson,</HI> and which was about four feet distance from where <HI>Wilson</HI> set on the stern of the canoe, and we rowed along about a mile and an half, and had no differ∣ence at that time—then Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> asked me when I intend∣ed to get out the lumber for Capt. <HI>Swanton,</HI> I told him as soon as I had done my planting, damn it says <HI>Wilson,</HI> I will not wait for that, I told him he had no need to, he might go to work and the more he did the more he would have to re∣ceive,
<PB REF="012725_0022_0F8BC26760073800"/>
but he seemed to be mad, and made use of bad lan∣guage, and I said nothing to him about that again, but asked him to set me ashore on the sands, near to my house, no damn you he says, I wont, not till I get up to Esquire <HI>Prebble's</HI> landing. I told him I should not be able to get home, he told me I might stay at a tavern all night, I told him I had no money, damn you he said, I will lend you money to pay for your supper and lodging, and made a laugh at it, for he knew he had none, and so he kept his course towards <HI>Abegadusett</HI> river—then I asked him if he did not intend to put me on shore, no damn you, he said, I wont till I get you up to the 'squire's l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding, or up to <HI>Stephen Goodwin's,</HI> I told him I had done as much for him before now, he asked me what I ever did for him, I told him he knew well enough, he told me I told a lie he did not, and insisted my telling him, I told him in letting him have things to support his family two years ago, and I had not got my pay yet, he said that was a damn'd lie, I told him he knew it was true, he then told me I was a damn'd liar, I told him I could not bear with such abuse, he told me he would use me worse, and he offer'd to push at me with his paddle, and I offered to catch hold of it, and then <HI>Ste∣phen Goodwin</HI> took away my oar, and <HI>Wilson</HI> struck me twice with his paddle, and as he was endeavouring to strike me the third time, I catch'd hold of his paddle and pulled him off the stern of the canoe, and then <HI>Stephen Goodwin</HI> took the paddle away from us, and I dont know but that I might strike him with my hand, but am not certain, for I held one of his hands with one of mine, and he told me to let him go, I told him I would if he would be easy, which he promised, he then got on the stern of the canoe again, and asked for his paddle, which <HI>Stephen Goodwin</HI> gave him upon said <HI>Wilson</HI>'s promising to be peaceable; <HI>Stephen Goodwin</HI> likewise gave me my oar, which was about six feet and an half long; and when we had rowed about the space of twenty or thirty rods, <HI>Wil∣son</HI> began his abusive language again, and said I was a damn'd liar, and I spoke a solemn word and said, that by the name of the living GOD, if he told me so again, I would strike him with my oar if I should strike him overboard, he said you do tell a damn'd lie, and if you offer to strike me I will run my paddle through your heart, and lifted his paddle against me, and being warned, I lifted my oar, not meaning to kill, nor to strike any certain place, but the chief aim I had was to save my own life, but unhappily the oar and paddle met, and the oar came down upon his head, and was the fatal blow, tho' GOD knows I had no design of murder in my heart; with the blow and the heeling of the canoe, <HI>Wilson</HI> fell overboard, immediately I said to <HI>Stephen Goodwin, Wilson</HI> is overboard,
<PB REF="012725_0023_0F8BC26B51605958"/>
for God's sake back astern the canoe, but he was incapable of being much help, though we backed the canoe as well as we could, but all in vain, for in less than two minutes I saw <HI>Wil∣son</HI> rise on the top of the water about three rods off, and he sunk again, and we made all the search we could, but in vain, we could see no more of him—I asked <HI>Stephen Goodwin</HI> if he knew who gave the first blow, he said he could not tell.— This is as true an account as I can give, as I know I must ans∣wer it at the bar of God.—And now let me exhort all people to abstain from drinking to excess, and from giving way to violent passion, which two vices were the principal reason of the death of Mr. <HI>David Wilson,</HI> and of my ignominious death by the hands of justice.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER to his Wife, Children and Friends.</HEAD>
<P>THIS to my true and loving wife, my children and my friend, I leave you these few lines to look upon when I am dead and gone; mourn for me, not as a murderer, for as I am in the presence of God begging for mercy and hope to obtain, my conscience is clear of that sin, and I have hopes through the blood of Christ, that Almighty God will cleanse me from all other sins, who you must all apply to for salvati∣on, by earnest prayer and supplication: And I beg in Christ's name, that you will all be in earnest, lest the day of your death come unawares and finds you unprepared, and then without dispute you will be eternally miserable; and for the Lord's sake, and your immortal soul's sake, old and young of you, I beg you will keep out of wicked company, for that is what has brought me to this unhappy fate, therefore take warning by this. Dear wife, if you put out any of your children, put them to good people, and so I must leave you to God, and beg you will take care and not be ensnared by a wicked world, and pray that God will bless you with all spiritual blessings, and the good things of this life; be contented with such necessaries as God gives you, and dont think hard of any crosses you meet with in this life, but say as David says, Da∣vid said it is good for me that I have been afflicted, and beg of God to sanctify them to you for good.—So I bid adieu to the world, and the Lord have mercy upon us.—This by <HI>Solomon Goodwin,</HI> the day before his execution.—</P>

<P>I beg that you would endeavor to live in the fear of God and beg of God to keep you out of bad company, and to give you early grace, and that you may make a right im∣provement of all the time that God gives you, and be con∣stant in prayer to Almighty God through the prevailing name of Jesus Christ, that God would be your staff and stay in this life, and guide you through the dark shadow of death to eter∣nal happiness in the world to come, which is a world of spirits made perfect. This from your loving compassionate father now under sentence of death, and who has but three days longer to live, according to sentence of law. Consider the shortness of time and the lack of paper.
