<Q>"As cold Waters to a thirsty Soul; so is good News from a far Country."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are so formed by the God of na∣ture, doubtless for wise and good ends, that the uneasy sensation to which we give the name of <HI>thirst,</HI> is an inseperable attendant on the want of some proper liquid. And as this want is increased, such proportionably will be the increase of uneasiness; and the uneasiness may gradually heighten, till it throws one into a state that is truly tormenting. The application of cooling
<PB N="6" REF="010255_0004_0F7E248F45D9B610"/>
drink is fitted, by an established law of hea∣ven, not only to remove away this uneasiness, but to give pleasure in the doing of it, by its manner of acting upon the organs of taste. There is scarce a keener perception of plea∣sure, than that which is felt by one that is a∣thirst upon being satisfied with agreable drink. Hence the desire of spiritual good things, in those who have had excited in them a serious sense of God and religion, is represented, in the sacred books, by the "cravings of a thirsty man after drink." Hence the devout David, when he would express the longing of his soul to "appear before God in his sanctuary," re∣sembles it to the "panting of an hart after the water-brooks." In like manner, "cold water to a thirsty soul" is the image under which the wise man would signifie, in my text, the gratefulness of "good news." Tis re∣freshing to the soul, as cold waters to the tongue when parched with thirst: Especially is good news adapted to affect the heart with pleasure, when it comes "from a far country," and is big with important blessings, not to a few individuals only, but to communities, and numbers of them scattered over a largely ex∣tended continent.</P>
<P>SUCH is the "good news" lately brought us from the other side the great waters. No news
<PB N="7" REF="010255_0005_0F7E248FD7FA7168"/>
handed to us from Great-Britain, ever gave us a quicker sense, or higher degree, of plea∣sure. It rapidly spread through the Colonies, and, as it passed along, opened in all hearts the springs of joy. The emotion of a soul just famished with thirst, upon taking down a full draught of cold water, is but a faint emblem of the superior gladness with which we were universally filled upon this great occasion. That was the language of our mouths, signify∣ing the pleasurable state of our minds, "as cold waters to a thirsty soul; so is this good news from a far country."</P>
<P>WHAT I have in view is, to take occasion from these words to call your attention to some of the important articles contained in the good news we have heard, which so power∣fully fit it to excite a pungent sense of plea∣sure in the breasts of all that inhabit these American lands. The way will then be pre∣pared to point out to you the wisest and best use we can make of these glad-tidings "from a far country."</P>
<P>THE first article in this "good news," ob∣viously presenting itself to consideration, is the kind and righteous regard the supreme autho∣rity in England, to which we inviolably owe submission, has paid to the "commercial good"
<PB N="8" REF="010255_0006_0F7E24909C8623A8"/>
of the Nation at home, and its dependant Pro∣vinces and Islands. One of the expresly as∣signed reasons for the REPEAL of the Stamp-Act, is declared in these words, "Whereas the continuance of said act—may be product∣ive of consequences greatly detrimental to the commercial interests of these Kingdoms, may it therefore please"—. The English Colonies and Islands are certainly included in the words, "these Kingdoms;" for they are as truly parts of them as either Scotland, Ireland, or even Eng∣land itself. It was therefore with a professed view to the commercial good, not only of the Nation at home, but of the Plantations also a∣broad, that the authority of the British King and Parliament interposed to render null and void that act, which, had it been continued in force, might, in its consequences, have tended to the hurt of this grand interest, inseperably connected with the welfare of both. From what more noble source could a REPEAL of this act have proceded? Not merely the re∣peal, but that benevolent righteous regard to the public good which gave it birth, is an important ingredient in the news that has made us glad. And wherein could this "good news" have been better adapted to soften our hearts, sooth our passions, and excite in us the sensations of unmingled joy? What that is conducive to our real happiness, may we not
<PB N="9" REF="010255_0007_0F7E249156219E70"/>
expect from a King and Parliament, whose regard to "the commercial interest" of the British Kingdoms has overpowered all opposition from resentment, the display of sovereign pleasure, or whatever other cause, and influenced them to give up, even a CROWN-REVENUE for the sake of a greater national good? With what confidence may we rely upon such a supreme legislature for the redress of all grievances, especially in the article of trade, and the devising every wise and fit method to put and keep it in a flourishing state? Should any thing, in time to come, un∣happily be brought into event, detrimental in its operation to the commerce between the Mother-country, and these Colonies, through mis-repre∣sentations from "lovers of themselves more than lovers" of their King and Country, may we not encourage ourselves to hope, that the like ge∣nerous public spirit that has relieved us now, will again interpose itself on our behalf? Hap∣py are we in being under the government of a King and Parliament, who can REPEAL, as well as enact a law, upon a view of it as tending to the public happiness! How preferable is our condition to their's, who have nothing to expect but from the arbitrary will of those, to whom they are slaves, rather than subjects?</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, giving us singular pleasure, contained in this "good news" is, the total re∣moval
<PB N="10" REF="010255_0008_0F7E249213081200"/>
of a grievous burden we must have sunk under, had it been continued. Had the real state of the Colonies been as well known at home as it is here, it is not easily supposeable, any there would have thought the tax, imposed on us by the STAMP-ACT, was sutably adjusted to our circumstances and abilities. There is scarce a man in any of the Colonies, certainly there is not in the New-England ones, that would be deemed worthy of the name of a rich man in Great-Britain. There may be here and there a rare instance of one that may have ac∣quired twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty thousand pounds sterling; and this is the most that can be made of what they may be thought worth: But for the rest, they are, generally speaking, in a low condition, or, at best, not greatly rising above it; though in different degrees, variously placing them in the enjoyment of the necessaries and comforts of life. And such it might naturally be expect∣ed would be the true state of the Colonists; as the lands they possess in this NEW COUNTRY could not have been subdued and fitted for pro∣fitable use, but by labor too expensive to allow of their being, at present, much increased in wealth. This labor indeed may properly be considered as a natural tax, which, though it has made way for an astonishing increase of subjects to the British Empire, greatly adding to its dig∣nity
<PB N="11" REF="010255_0009_0F7E249311B38650"/>
and strength, has yet been the occasion of keeping us poor and low.—It ought also to be remembered, the occasions, in a NEW COUNTRY, for the grant or purchase of property, with the obligations arising therefrom, and in instances of comparatively small value, are unavoidably more numerous than in those that have been long set∣tled. The occasions also for recourse to the law are, in like manner, vastly multiplied: For which reason, the same tax by <HI>stamped-paper</HI> would take vastly more in proportion from the people here, than in England. And what would have rendered this duty the more hard and se∣vere is, that it must have been paid in addition to the Government-tax here, which was, I have good reason to think, more heavy on us in the late war, and is so still on account of the great debt then contracted, at least in this province, in proportion to our numbers and abilities, than that which, in every way, was laid on the peo∣ple either of Scotland, Ireland, or England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have been assured by a Gentleman of reputation and fortune, in this Town, that, in the late time of war, he sent one of his rate-bills to a correspon∣dent of note in London, for his judgment upon it; and had this answer in return from his friend, "that he did not believe there was a man in all England, who paid so much, in proportion, to∣wards the support of the Government." It will render the above account the more easily credible, if I inform the reader, that I have lately and pur∣posely conversed with one of the ASSESSORS of this Town, who has been annually chosen by them in∣to this office for a great number of years, for which reason he may be thought a person of integrity, and one that may be depended on; and he declares to me, that the assessment upon this Town, parti∣cularly in one of the years when the tax on account of the war was great, was as follows: On <HI>personal</HI> estate, thirteen shillings and four pence on the pound, that is to say, if a man's income from money at interest, or in any other way, was sixty pounds per annum, he was assessed sixty times thirteen shil∣lings and four pence, and in this proportion whe∣ther the sum was more or less: On <HI>real</HI> estate, the assessment was at the rate of six years income, that is to say, if a man's house or land was valued at two hundred pounds per annum income, this two hundred pounds was multiplied by six, amounting to twelve hundred pounds, and the interest of this twelve hundred pounds, that is, seventy two pounds was the sum he was obliged to pay. Besides this, the rate upon every man's pole, and the poles of all the males in his house upwards of sixteen years of age, was about nineteen shillings lawful money, which is only one quarter part short of sterling. Over and above all this, they paid their part of an excise that was laid upon Tea, Coffee, Rum and Wine, a∣mounting to a very considerable sum.</P>
<P>How it was in the other Provinces, or in the other Towns of this, I know not; but it may be relied on as fact, that this was the tax levied upon the Town of Boston. And it has been great ever since, tho' not so enormously so as at that time. Every one may now judge, whether we had not abundant rea∣son for mournful complaint, when, in addition to the vast sums (considering our numbers and abilities) we were obliged to pay, we were loaded with the STAMP-DUTY; which would, in a few years, have taken away all our money, and rendered us abso∣lutely incapable, either of supporting the Govern∣ment here, or of carrying on any sort of commerce, unless by an exchange of commodities</P></NOTE>
<PB N="12" REF="010255_0010_0F7E2493A7E90698"/>
This if mentioned cursorily, was never, that I remember enlarged upon, and set in a striking light, in any of the papers wrote in the late times, as it might easily have been done, and to good purpose—Besides all which, 'tis undoubt∣edly true, that the circulating money in all the Colonies would not have been sufficient to have
<PB N="13" REF="010255_0011_0F7E249813F010A0"/>
paid the Stamp-duty only for two years; and an effectual bar was put in the way of the intro∣duction of more, by the restraints that were laid upon our trade in those instances wherein it might, in some measure, have been procured.</P>
<P>IT was this grievance that occasioned the bit∣ter complaint all over these lands, "we are de∣nied straw, and yet the full tale of bricks is re∣quired of us!" Or, as it was otherwise uttered, We must soon be obliged "to borrow money for the King's tribute, and that upon our lands. Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: And lo! We must bring into bondage our sons and our daugh∣ters to be servants." We should have been stu∣pid, had not a spirit been excited in us to apply, in all reasonable ways, for the removal of so insupportable a burden. And such an union in
<PB N="14" REF="010255_0012_0F7E2498EE1E9C30"/>
spirit was never before seen in the Colonies: Nor was there ever such universal joy as upon the news of our deliverance from that which might have proved a yoke, the most grievous that was ever laid upon our necks. It affected in all hearts the lively perceptions of pleasure, filling our mouths with laughter. No man ap∣peared without a smile in his countenance. No one met his friend, but he bid him joy. That was our united song of praise, "Thou hast turn∣ed for us our mourning into dancing; thou hast put off our sackcloth, and girded us with glad∣ness.—Our glory [our tongue] shall sing praise to thee, and not be silent: O Lord our God! we will give thanks to thee forever."</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, in this "news," making it "good," is the hopeful prospect it gives us of being continued in the enjoyment of certain li∣berties and privileges, valued by us next to life itself. Such are those of being "tried by our equals," and of "making grants for the support of government of that which is our own, either in person, or by representatives we have chosen for the purpose." Whether the Colonists were in∣vested with a RIGHT to these liberties and pri∣vileges that ought not be wrested from them, or whether they were not, tis the truth of fact, that they really thought they were: All of them as natural heirs to it, by being born sub∣jects
<PB N="15" REF="010255_0013_0F7E2499AC4DF6F8"/>
to the British Crown; and some of them, by additional charter-grants, the legality of which, instead of being contested, have all along, from the days of our fathers, been assented to, and allowed of, by the supreme authority at home. And they imagined, whether justly, or not. I dispute not, that their RIGHT to the free and full enjoyment of these privileges was their righteous due in consequence of what they, and their fore-fathers, had done and suffered in sub∣duing and defending these American lands, not only for their own support, but to add extent, strength and glory to the British-Crown. And as it had been early and deeply impressed on their minds, that their Charter-privileges were RIGHTS that had been dearly paid for by a vast expence of blood, treasure and labor, without which this continent must have still remained in a wilderness-state, and the property of savages only; it could not but strongly put in motion their passion of grief, when they were laid un∣der a Parliamentary restraint as to the exercise of that liberty, they esteemed their greatest glory. It was eminently this that filled their minds with jealousie, and at length a settled fear, lest they should gradually be brought into a state of the most abject slavery. This it was that gave rise to the cry, which became general thoughout the Colonies, "we shall be made to serve as bond-servants.—Our lives will be bitter with hard
<PB N="16" REF="010255_0014_0F7E249A61C366F0"/>
bondage." Nor were the Jews more pleased with the royal provision in their day, which, under God, delivered them from their bondage in Egypt, than were the Colonists with the REPEAL of that act which had so greatly alarmed their fears, and troubled their hearts. It was to them as "life from the dead." They "rejoiced and were glad." And it gave strength and vigor to their joy, while they looked upon this REPEAL, not merely as taking off the grievous restraint that had been laid upon their liberties and pri∣vileges, but as containing in it an intention of continued indulgence in the free exercise of them. Tis in this view of it, that they exult as those who are "glad in heart;" esteeming themselves happy beyond almost any people now living on the face of the earth. May they ever be this happy people! And ever have "God for their Lord!"</P>
<P>THIS news is yet further welcome to us, as it has made way for the return of our love, in all its genuine exercises, towards those on the other side of the atlantic, who, in common with ourselves, profess subjection to the same most gracious Sovereign. The affectionate regard of the American inhabitants for their Mother Coun∣try, was never exceeded by any Colonists, in any part, or age of the world. We esteemed our∣selves parts of one whole, members of the same
<PB N="17" REF="010255_0015_0F7E249B146BF760"/>
collective body. What affected the people of England, affected us. We partook of their joys and sorrows; "rejoicing when they re∣joiced, and weeping when they wept." Ad∣verse things in the conduct of providence to∣wards them alarmed our fears, and gave us pain; while prosperous events dilated our hearts, and in proportion to their number and greatness. This tender sympathy with our brethren at home, it is acknowledged, began to languish from the commencement of a late Parliamentary act. There arose hereupon a general suspicion, whether they esteemed us brethren, and treated us with that kindness we might justly expect from them. This jealousie, working in our breasts, cooled the fervor of our love; and had that act been continued in force, it might have gradually brought on an alienation of heart, that would have been greatly detrimental to them, as it would also have been to ourselves.—But the REPEAL, of which we have had authentic accounts, has opened the channels for a full flow of our for∣mer affection towards our brethren in Great-Britain. Unhappy jealousies, uncomfortable surmisings and heart-burnings are now re∣moved; and we perceive the motion of an affection for the Country from whence our fore-fathers came, which would influence us
<PB N="18" REF="010255_0016_0F7E249D0F2580A0"/>
to the most vigorous exertions, as we might be called, to promote their welfare, looking upon it, in a sense, our own. We again feel with them, and for them; and are happy or unhappy, as they are either in prosperous or adverse circumstances. We can, and do, with all sincerity, "pray for the peace of Great-Britain, and that they may prosper that love her," adopting those words of the devout Psalmist, "Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For our brethren's sake we will say, peace be within thee."</P>
<P>IN fine, this news is refreshing to us "as cold waters to a thirsty soul," as it has effected an alteration in the state of things among us unspeakably to our advantage. There is no way in which we can so strikingly be made sensible of this, as by contrasting the state we were lately in, and the much worse one we should soon have been in had the Stamp-Act been enforced, with that happy one we are put into by its repeal.</P>
<P>UPON its being made certain to the Colo∣nies, that the Stamp-Act had passed both houses of Parliament, and received the King's fiat, a general spirit of uneasiness at once took place, which, gradually increasing, soon discovered
<PB N="19" REF="010255_0017_0F7E249DA1C3AD40"/>
itself, by the wiser sons of liberty, in laudable endeavors to obtain relief; though, by others, in murmurings and complaints, in anger and cla∣mour, in bitterness, wrath and strife; and by some evil-minded persons, taking occasion herefor from the general ferment of men's minds, in those violent out-rages upon the pro∣perty of others, which, by being represented in an undue light, may have reflected dishonor upon a country which has an abhorrence of such injurious conduct. The Colonies were never before in a state of such discontent, anxiety and perplexing sollicitude: Some de∣spairing of a redress, some hoping for it, and all fearing what would be the event. And had it been the determination of the King and Parliament to have carried the STAMP-ACT into effect by ships of war, and an embarkati∣on of troops, their condition, however unhappy before, would have been inconceivably more so. They must either have submited to what they thought an insupportable burden, and have parted with their property without any will of their own, or have stood upon their defence; in either of which cases, their situa∣tion must have been deplorably sad. So far as I am able to judge from that firmness of mind and resolution of spirit, which appeared among all sorts of persons, as grounded upon
<PB N="20" REF="010255_0018_0F7E249E1B57F060"/>
this principle deeply rooted in their minds, that they had a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Colonists may reasonably be excused for their mistake (if it was one) in thinking, that they were vested with this CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, as it was the opinion of Lord CAMDEN, declared in the house of Lords, and of Mr. PITT, signified in the house of Commons, that the STAMP-ACT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. This is said upon the authority of the public prints.</NOTE> to grant their own monies, and to be tried by their peers, tis more probable, they would not have submited, unless they had been obliged to it by superior power. Not that they had a thought in their hearts, as may have been re∣presented, of being an independant people. They esteemed it both their happiness and their glory to be, in common with the inhabitants of England, Scotland and Ireland, the subjects of King GEORGE the third, whom they heartily love and honor, and in defence of whose Per∣son and Crown they would chearfully expend their treasure, and lose even their blood. But it was a sentiment they had imbibed, that they should be wanting neither in loyalty to their King, or a due regard to the British-Parliament, if they should defend those rights which they imagined were unalienable, upon
<PB N="21" REF="010255_0019_0F7E249ED47DB658"/>
the foot of justice, by any power on earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great Mr. PITT would not have said, in a certain august Assembly, speaking of the Ameri∣cans, "I rejoice that they have resisted," if, in his judgment, they might not, in consistency with their duty to government, have made a stand a∣gainst the STAMP-ACT. Tis certainly true, there may be such exercise of power, and in instances of such a nature, as to render non-submission war∣rantable upon the foot of reason and righteousness: Otherwise it will be difficult, if possible, to justifie the REVOLUTION, and that ESTABLISHMENT in consequence of it, upon which his present Majesty sits upon the British throne. That non-submission would have been justifiable, had it been determined that the STAMP-ACT should be enforced, I pre∣sume not to say: Though none, I believe, who are the friends of liberty, will deny, that it would have been justifiable, should it be first supposed, that THIS ACT essentially broke in upon our CONSTI∣TUTIONAL RIGHTS as Englishmen. Whether it did, or not, is a question it would be impertinent in me to meddle with. It is the truth of fact, that the Colonists generally and really thought it did; and that it might be opposed without their incurring the guilt of disloyalty or rebellion; and they were led into this way of thinking upon what they ima∣gined were the principles which, in their operation, gave KING WILLIAM, and QUEEN MARY, of blessed memory, the Crown of England.</NOTE> And had they, upon this principle, whether ill or well founded, stood upon their defence, what must have been the effect? There would have been opened, on this American continent, a most doleful scene of outrage, violence, de∣solation, slaughter, and, in a word, all those
<PB N="22" REF="010255_0020_0F7E24A157B3BBD8"/>
terrible evils that may be expected as the at∣tendants on a state of civil war. No language can describe the distresses, in all their various kinds and degrees, which would have made us miserable. God only knows how long they might have continued, and whether they would have ended in any thing short of our total ruin. Nor would the Mother-Country, whatever some might imagine, have been untouched with what was doing in the Colonies. Those millions that were due from this continent to Great-Britain, could not have been paid;—a stop, a total stop, would have been put to the importation of those manufactures which are the support of thousands at home, often re∣peated. And would the British merchants, and manufacturers, have set easie in such a state of things? There would, it may be, have been as much clamour, wrath and strife in the very bowels of the nation, as in these distant lands: Nor could our destruction have been unconnected with consequences at home infi∣nitely to be dreaded.—.</P>
<P>But the longed for REPEAL has scattered our fears, removed our difficulties, enliven∣ed our hearts, and laid the foundation for future prosperity, equal to the adverse state we should have been in, had the Act been conti∣nued and enforced.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010255_0021_0F7E24A219657ED0"/>
WE may now be easie in our minds, con∣tented with our condition. We may be at peace and quiet among ourselves, every one minding his own business. All ground of complaint, that we are "sold for bond-men and bond-women," is removed away; and in∣stead of being slaves to those who treat us with rigor, we are indulged the full exercise of those liberties which have been transmitted to us, as the richest inheritance, from our fore∣fathers. We have now greater reason than ever to love, honor and obey our gracious King, and pay all becoming reverence and respect to his two houses of Parliament; and may with intire confidence, rely on their wis∣dom, lenity, kindness, and power, to promote our welfare. We have now, in a word, no∣thing to "make us afraid," but may "sit every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree," in the full enjoyment of the many good things we are favored with in the providence of God.</P>
<P>UPON such a change in the state of our cir∣cumstances, we should be lost to all sense of duty and gratitude, and act as though we had no understanding, if our hearts did not expand with joy. And, in truth, the danger is, lest we should exceed in the expressions of it. It may be said of these Colonies, as of the Jewish people, upon the repeal of the decree of Aha∣suerus,
<PB N="24" REF="010255_0022_0F7E24A292A6B820"/>
which devoted them to destruction, they "had light and gladness, joy and honor; and in every province, and in every city, whi∣thersoever the King's commandment and his decree came, they had joy and gladness, a feast day, and a good day;" saying within them∣selves, "the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad." May the remembrance of this MEMORABLE REPEAL be preserved, and handed down to all future generations, in every province, in every city, and in every family, so as never to be forgotten!</P>
<P>WE now proceed, the way being thus pre∣pared for it, to point out the proper use we should make of this "good news from a far country," which is grateful to us "as cold waters to a thirsty soul."</P>
<P>WE have already had our rejoicings, in the civil sense, upon the "glad-tidings" from our Mother-Country; and tis to our honor, that they were carried on so universally within the bounds of a decent warrantable regularity. There was never, among us, such a collection of all sorts of people upon any public occasion: Nor were the methods in which they signified their joy ever so beautifully varied and multi∣plied, and yet, none had reason to complain
<PB N="25" REF="010255_0023_0F7E24A35758F590"/>
of disorderly conduct. The show was seasona∣bly ended, and we had afterwards a perfectly quiet night. There has indeed been no public disturbance since the outrage at Lieut. Governor HUTCHINSON'S house. That was so detested by Town and Country, and such a spirit at once so generally stirred up, particularly among THE PEOPLE, to oppose such villainous conduct, as has preserved us ever since in a state of as great freedom from mobish actions, as has been known in the Country. Our friends at home, it should seem, have entertained fears, lest, upon the lenity and condescention of the King and Parliament, we should prove ourselves a factious turbulent people; and our enemies hope we shall. But tis not easie to conceive on what the fears of the one, or the hopes of the other, should be ground∣ed, unless they have received injurious represen∣tations of the spirit that lately prevailed in this, as well as the other Colonies; which was not a spirit to raise needless disturbances, or to commit outrages upon the persons or property of any; though some of those sons of wickedness, which are to be found in all places,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been said, and in the public prints, that there have been mobish riotous doings in London, and other parts of England, at one time and another; and that great men, at such times, men far superior to any among us in dignity and power, suffered in their <HI>persons,</HI> by insulting threatning words and actions; and in their <HI>property.</HI> by the injurious vi∣olence that destroyed their substance. Would it be just to characterise London, much more England it∣self, from the conduct of these disturbers of it's peace? it would as reasonably, as certainly, be e∣steemed a vile reproach, should they, on this account, be represented as, in general, a turbulent seditious people, disposed to throw off their subjection to go∣vernment, and bring things into a state of anarchy and confusion. If this has been the representation that has been made of the Colonists, on account of what any may have suffered in their persons, or effects, by the ungoverned disorderly behavior of some mobishly disposed persons, it is really nothing better than a base slander; and no more applicable to them, than to the people of England. The Co∣lonists in general, the inhabitants of this Province in particular, are as great enemies to all irregular turbulent procedings, and as good friends to Go∣vernment, and as peaceable loyal Subjects, as any that call King GEORGE the IIId, their rightful and lawful Sovereign.</NOTE> might take oc∣casion

from the stand that was made for liberty to commit violence with an high hand. There has not been, since the REPEAL the appearance of a spirit tending to public disorder; nor is there any danger such a spirit should be encou∣raged, or discovered, unless the people should be needlesly and unreasonably irritated by those, who, to serve themselves, might be willing we should gratifie such as are our enemies, and make those so who have been our good friends.—But to leave this digression,</P>

THOUGH our civil joy has been expressed in a decent orderly way, it would be but a poor piti∣ful thing, should we rest here, and not make our religious grateful acknowledgments to the su∣preme Ruler of the world, to whose super intend∣ing providence it is principally to be ascribed, that we have had "given us so great deliver∣ance." Whatever were the means or instru∣ments in order to this, that glorious being, whose throne is in the heavens, and whose kingdom ruleth over all, had the chief hand herein. He sat at the helm, and so governed all things re∣lative to it, as to bring it to this happy issue. It was under his alwise over-ruling influence, that a SPIRIT was raised in all the Colonies no∣bly to assert their freedom as men, and English-born subjects; a spirit, which, in the course of it's operation, was highly serviceable, not by any irregularities it might be the occasion of, [in this imperfect state, they will more or less mix themselves with every thing great and good] but by it's manly efforts, setting forth the rea∣sons they had for complaint in a fair, just, and strongly convincing light; hereby awakening the attention of Great-Britain, opening the eyes of the merchants and manufacturers there, and en∣gaging them, for their own interest as well as that of America to exert themselves in all rea∣sonable ways to help us: It was under the
<PB N="28" REF="010255_0026_0F7E24A7AEF57FE8"/>
same all governing influence, that the late mini∣stry, full of projections tending to the hurt of these Colonies, was so seasonably changed into the pre∣sent patriotic one, which is happily disposed, in all the methods of wisdom, to promote our welfare:</P>
<P>It was under the same influence still, that so many friends of eminent character were raised up, and spirited to appear advocates on our behalf, and plead our cause with irresistable force: It was under this same influence also, that the heart of our King, and the British Parliament, were so turned in favor to us as to reverse that decree, which, had it been established, would have thrown this whole continent, if not the nation itself, into a state of the utmost confusion: In short, it was ultimately owing to this influence of the God of heaven, that the thoughts, the views, the purposes, the speeches, the writings, and the whole conduct of all who were engaged in this great affair, were so over-ruled to bring into effect the desired happy event.</P>
<P>AND shall we not make all due acknowledg∣ments to the great Sovereign of the world on this joyful occasion? Let us, my brethren, take care that our hearts be sutably touched with a sense of the bonds we are under to the Lord of the universe; and let us express the joy and grati∣tude of our hearts by greatly praising him for the greatness of his goodness, in thus scattering our
<PB N="29" REF="010255_0027_0F7E24A827A82920"/>
fears, removing away our burdens, and continu∣ing us in the enjoyment of our most highly va∣lued liberties and privileges. And let us not only praise him with our lips, rendering thanks to his holy name; but let us honor him by a well ordered conversation. "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice." And "to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and mind and strength, and to love our neighbour as ourselves, is better than whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices." Acti∣ons speak much louder than words. In vain shall we pretend, that we are joyful in God, or thankful to him, if it is not our endeavor, as we have been taught by the grace of God, which has appeared to us by Jesus Christ, to "deny all un∣godliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the world." doing all things whatsoever it has pleased God to com∣mand us.</P>
<P>AND as he has particularly enjoined it on us to be "subject to the higher powers, ordained by him to be his ministers for good," we cannot, upon this occasion, more properly express our gra∣titude to him, than by approving ourselves duti∣ful and loyal to the gracious King, whom he has placed over us. Not that we can be justly tax∣ed with the want of love or subjection to the British Throne. We may have been abused by
<PB N="30" REF="010255_0028_0F7E24A8E6707FF8"/>
false and injurious representations upon this head: But King GEORGE the IIId has no subjects, not within the realm of England itself, that are more strongly attached to his person and family, that bear a more sincere and ardent affection to∣wards him, or that would exert themselves with more life and spirit in defence of his crown and dignity.—But it may notwithstanding. at this time, be seasonable to stir up your minds, by putting you in remembrance of your duty to "pray for Kings, and all that are in subordinate authority under them," and to "honor and obey them in the Lord." And, if we should take oc∣casion from the great lenity and condescending goodness of those, who are supreme in authority over us not to "despise government." not to "speak evil of dignities," not to go into any method of unseemly disorderly conduct; but to "lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty," every man moving in his own pro∣per sphere, and taking due care to "render un∣to Caesar the things that are Caesar and to God the things that are God's;"—we should honor our selves, answer the expectations of those who have dealt thus favorably with us; and, what is more, we should express a becoming regard to the governing-pleasure of almighty God.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="010255_0029_0F7E24A955E63B50"/>
It would also be a sutable return of gratitude to God, if we entertained in our minds, and were ready to express in all proper ways, a just sense of the obligations we are under to those Patrons of liberty and righteousness, who were the in∣struments employed by him and whose wise and powerful endeavors, under his blessing, were effectual to promote at once the interest of the nation at home, and of these distant Colonies. Their names will, I hope, be ever dear to us, and handed down as such to the latest posterity. That illustrious name, in special, PITT, will, I trust, be never mentioned but with honor, as the SAVIOR, under God, and the two Kings who made him their prime minister, both of the nation and these Colonies, not only from the power of France, but, from that which is much worse, a state of slavery under the appellation of English∣men. May his memory be blessed! May his great services for his King, the nation, and these Colonies, be had in everlasting remembrance!</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us be ambitious to make it evident, by the manner of our conduct, that we are good subjects and good christians: So shall we, in the best way, express the grateful sense we have of our obligations to that glorious being, to the wisdom and goodness of whose pre∣sidency over all human affairs it is principally
<PB N="32" REF="010255_0030_0F7E24AA1A8F6C58"/>
owing, that the great object of our fear, and anxious concern, has been so happily removed. And may it ever be our care, to behave towards him, so as that he may appear on our behalf in every time of danger and difficulty, guard us a∣gainst evil, and continue to us all our enjoyments both civil and religious! And may they be trans∣mited from us to our children, and to children's children, as long as the sun and the moon shall endure.</P>
