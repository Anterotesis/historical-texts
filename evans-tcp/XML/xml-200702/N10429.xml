<HEAD>THE AMERICAN QUERIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHETHER <HI>Americans</HI> have not a right to speak their sentiments on subjects of government; and whether all attempts to check and discourage freedom of speech, any farther than to prevent the licentious abuses of it, are not to be consi∣dered as unwarrantable usurpations, tending to introduce and establish a bondage of the worst kind?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether <HI>Americans</HI> have not an equal right to express their sentiments, when they happen to differ from, as when they happen to correspond with, the <HI>popular</HI> opinion?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether I differ more from another, than he differs from me; and, consequently, whether he has a better right to abuse me for a difference of sentiment, than I have to abuse him?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="4" REF="013222_0003_0F904621C4900F70"/>
4. Whether bigotry be not naturally pro∣ductive of intolerance, and whether higotry and intolerance in <HI>politics</HI> be not as absurd in reason, as mean in their nature, and as destructive to society, as bigotry and intole∣rance in matters of religion?</P>
<P N="5">5. Whether there can be a greater proof of bigotry, either in religion or politics, than an obstinate resolution to hear or see nothing that is offered on the subject in ques∣tion, by persons who are supposed to be of different sentiments?</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether such a resolution be not also a proof, that a man in <HI>conscious</HI> of the <HI>weak∣ness</HI> of his cause, and <HI>afraid</HI> of the force of those arguments which may be offered against him?</P>
<P N="7">7. With regard to the present disputes be∣tween the <HI>British American</HI> colonies and their mother country, whether there be not many of the colonists, who, by refusing to hear or see what is offered on the side of govern∣ment,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said that many persons, and some who hold places of trust under government, have put a stop to their <HI>News-papers,</HI> not because the advocates for the colonies are not allowed fair play by the <HI>printer,</HI> but because those who are dis∣posed to think more favourably of the administration than some of their neighbours, are allowed to speak.</NOTE> betray the abovementioned consci∣ousness and fear?</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="5" REF="013222_0004_0F90462399F14410"/>
8. Whether political bodies do not resem∣ble animal bodies in many respects; and whether, when they are disordered, the same regimen and management which are needful for one, may not be proper for the other, in similar cases?</P>
<P N="9">9. Whether the <HI>American</HI> colonies do not consider themselves as composing one dis∣tinct political body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"They form one political body, of which each colony is a member."</NOTE>; and whether this body does not appear at this time to be deeply disordered?</P>
<P N="10">10. Whether the disorder of the colo∣nies, to speak in language taken from ani∣mal bodies, be not of the <HI>feverish</HI> kind, as it is attended with an irregular, high pulse, and discovers, in some parts, a dangerous swelling and inflammation; and whether it has not been occasioned, in a great mea∣sure, by their own <HI>imprudence</HI> and <HI>intem∣perance?</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Whether <HI>heating doses</HI> do not, in all cases, tend to increase a fever; and whe∣ther inflammatory publications and ha∣rangues
<PB N="6" REF="013222_0005_0F904624601EAFD0"/>
be not so many heating doses, with regard to political bodies?</P>
<P N="12">12. Whether, in investigating the na∣ture and cause of disorders, and in fixing upon a method of cure, we ought not to have recourse to plain facts, and to gene∣ral and established principles, instead of be∣ing governed by the advice, and relying upon the opinions of notorious quacks and empiricks, who have an interest in deceiving us?</P>
<P N="13">13. Whether some degree of respect be not always due from inferiors to superiors, and especially from children to parents; and whether the refusal of this on any occa∣sion, be not a violation of the general laws of society, to say nothing here of the obli∣gations of religion and morality?</P>
<P N="14">14. Whether what constitutes right con∣duct among men, does not constitute right conduct among societies, or bodies of men, with regard to one another; and whether the latter can be less criminal, or their conduct less disgusting and shocking to the genuine feelings of the <HI>moral sense,</HI> when they transgress the common rule of duty, than the former?</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="7" REF="013222_0006_0F90462C10BEED20"/>
15. Whether <HI>Great-Britain</HI> bears not a relation to these colonies, similar to that of a parent to children; and whether any parent can put up with such disrespectful and abusive treatment from children, as <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has lately received from her colonies?</P>
<P N="16">16. Whether all true friends to the co∣lonies, with whatever zeal they may think themselves bound to assert and support their claim, ought not, from a regard both to duty and safety, on every proper occasion, to express their disapprobation of a beha∣viour, which is indecent and shameful in it∣self, and which has brought upon the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> the indignation of a power, which the proudest nation in <HI>Europe</HI> reveres, and under whose resentments the strongest would tremble?</P>
<P N="17">17. Whether it be a mark either of wis∣dom or candour to believe, declare, or in∣sinuate, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has acted alto∣gether from wrong motives, and the colo∣nies altogether from right ones?</P>
<P N="18">18. Whether there can be any medium between being subjects and not subjects; and whether, if the <HI>Americans</HI> be not <HI>British</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="013222_0007_0F90462C10BEED20"/>
subjects, they are not, with regard to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> aliens and foreigners?</P>
<P N="19">19. Whether, if the colonies be a part of the great <HI>British</HI> community, they are not necessarily subject in all cases, to the juris∣diction of that legislative power which re∣presents this community, or, in other words, to the <HI>British</HI> parliament?</P>
<P N="20">20. Whether the supreme legislative au∣thority of every nation does not necessarily extend to all the dominions of that nation; and whether any place, to which this au∣thority does not extend, can justly be said to be a part of its dominions?</P>
<P N="21">21. Whether, in consequence of a general grant, particular claims, founded upon par∣tial constructions and remote inferences, which are contrary to the apparent interest and design of the granter, can be valid, either in law or in equity?</P>
<P N="22">22. Whether any <HI>direct</HI> evidence has hi∣therto appeared in favour of the exemption for which the colonies contend; and whe∣ther it does not concern the managers of their cause, previously to any other steps, to produce <HI>such</HI> evidence in support of their claim?</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="9" REF="013222_0008_0F90462C337D2AE8"/>
23. Whether there be any proof or pro∣bability, that, when the first grants of land in <HI>America</HI> were made by the <HI>British</HI> crown to <HI>British</HI> subjects, it was intended by the former, or understood by the latter, that they were to be no longer subject to the su∣preme legislative authority of the <HI>British</HI> nation?</P>
<P N="24">24. Whether, supposing this to have been really intended, it was in the power of the crown to alienate any part of its dominions, without the adivce and consent of parlia∣ment?</P>
<P N="25">25. Whether the above supposition does not imply, that the executive power is able at pleasure, to annul, alter, or restrain the legislative power, which is the greatest ab∣surdity?</P>
<P N="26">26. Whether the exemption contended for be not inconsistent with the nature of dependent colonies, and compatible only with the idea of independent states?</P>
<P N="27">27. Whether a right in the colonies to choose which laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> they will obey, and which they will disobey, would leave any obligation to obedience at all?</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="10" REF="013222_0009_0F90462D04FFC900"/>
28. Whether, in such a case, the <HI>Ameri∣cans,</HI> being not <HI>English</HI> subjects, can claim the protection of the English laws, or talk of their rights <HI>as Englishmen,</HI> with any pro∣priety?</P>
<P N="29">29. Whether there has ever been a time, since the settlement of the colonies, in which the nation appears to have thought, that it had not a full and compleat right of juris∣diction over them, notwithstanding the pri∣vileges granted them by charter?</P>
<P N="30">30. Whether there has ever been a time, in which the colonies appear to have thought, that the nation had not a full and compleat right of jurisdiction over them, till about the year 1764?</P>
<P N="31">31. Whether more was expressly granted or meant to be granted, by charter to any of the colonies, than authority for regulating respectively their own <HI>police;</HI> and whether such an authority, granted for the purpose of internal regulation and government, can be fairly construed to exempt any society, or incorporated body whatever, from the supreme legislative power of that nation, to which it belongs?</P>
<P N="32">32. Whether, on the contrary, obedience
<PB N="11" REF="013222_0010_0F90462DB829B6A0"/>
to the laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> without any restriction or exception, was not clearly ob∣served in all the charters granted to the co∣lonies; and particularly, whether the <HI>right of parliament to lay taxes,</HI> was not expressly and literally observed in the charter of <HI>Pennsylvania?</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. Whether therefore the <HI>Pennsylvani∣ans</HI> ought not now to be out of the question, as they can have no plausible pretence for urging a claim, from which they have been precluded by their own former stipulation?</P>
<P N="34">34. Whether the first charter which was granted, for the purpose of <HI>colonization,</HI> by the crown of <HI>England</HI> in 1606, and the se∣cond, which was granted three years after∣wards, did not subject the two <HI>Virginia</HI> com∣panies to laws made by a council of the pro∣prietors residing in <HI>England,</HI> first nominated by the crown, and afterwards to be elected by the proprietors residing in <HI>England;</HI> and whether the same charters did not pro∣vide, that even the King might tax all the inhabitants within the grant, by his sole pre∣rogative, without consulting his parliament, and appropriate the monies, thus raised by taxes, for the use and benefit of the crown only?</P>
<P N="35"><PB N="12" REF="013222_0011_0F90462E7A3CF750"/>
35. Whether the territory granted upon these terms did not extend from latitude 34 to latitute 45, and include all the country lying between <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and consequently the present <HI>New-England</HI> colonies; the inhabitants of which originally settled under the very charters above-men∣tioned, after having purchased from one of those companies?</P>
<P N="36">36. Whether the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> company had authority, under their first charter, to assess or tax the inhabitants for any purposes whatever; and whether their <HI>having levied money of the inhabitants</HI> was not alledged in the writ of <HI>scire facias</HI> issued against their charter, in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the second, as an act of notorious delinquency, upon which, judgment was given against them in the court of King's-Bench, and the charter vacated?</P>
<P N="37">37. Whether, in the new charter, which was granted them by <HI>William and Mary,</HI> and under which they have been governed to the present year, the power of levying taxes is not restrained altogether to provincial and local purposes, and allowed to be exercised over such only as are <HI>inhabitants</HI> and <HI>propri∣etors</HI> in the province, so that the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="013222_0012_0F90462F39352440"/>
traders and their goods, which may happen to be in any of the ports of the province, are entirely exempted from this authority?</P>
<P N="38">38. Whether the whole tenor of this charter does not operate against the claim that is made by the people of the <HI>Massa∣chusetts-Bay,</HI> evidencing the limitation of <HI>their</HI> legislative authority, instead of re∣straining the power of the British parlia∣ment?</P>
<P N="39">39. Whether the charter granted to Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> in 1632, did not express∣ly provide, that the inhabitants of <HI>Mary∣land,</HI> for the suture, should be separated from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and not dependent upon the government of that, or any other colony; BUT, that they should be <HI>subject immediately to the</HI> CROWN <HI>of</HI> England, <HI>as depending thereof forever?</HI></P>
<P N="40">40. Whether the charters granted by Charles the Second, to the inhabitants of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> are more than bare charters of incorporation, erecting them respectively into corporate bodies, and empowering them to perform corpo∣rate acts, in the same manner, say the char∣ters, <Q>as <HI>other</HI> our liege people of <HI>this our realm of</HI> England, or any other corpora∣tion,
<PB N="14" REF="013222_0013_0F90463003C35D18"/>
or body politic, within the same;</Q> necessarily implying, that they were thought to be within the realm of <HI>England,</HI> and subject in all cases, to the supreme authori∣ty of the realm?</P>
<P N="41">41. Whether the charter of <HI>Carolina,</HI> granted in the same reign, did not fully de∣clare the like dependency of the inhabi∣tants, in the following words: <Q>Our will and pleasure is, that they be subject im∣mediately to our crown of <HI>England,</HI> as depending thereof forever; and that the inhabitants shall not, at any time, be liable to answer to any matter out of our said province, other than in our realm of <HI>England,</HI> and dominion of <HI>Wales?</HI></Q></P>
<P N="42">42. Whether subjection to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>England</HI> ever meant, in public instruments, subjection only to him, who held the crown of <HI>England,</HI> in his <HI>private</HI> or <HI>personal</HI> capa∣city; and whether the laws do not always mean, by the authority of the crown, the supreme authority of the nation, represented by the crown?</P>
<P N="43">43. Whether the use of the great seal of <HI>England,</HI> in ratifying the grants above∣mentioned, does not prove that, in each
<PB N="15" REF="013222_0014_0F90463167CA91B8"/>
instance, the whole affair, on one side, was a public transaction, and in behalf of the nation, and that the subjection, or depen∣dency expressly reserved, was to be of the same extent with the authority that required it?</P>
<P N="44">44. Whether it does not appear from acts that have been made in evey reign, since the founding of the colonies, that it was the sense of Parliament, that its authority over the <HI>American</HI> plantations was as full and un∣limited, as over any other part of his Ma∣jesty's dominions?</P>
<P N="45">45. Whether the preamble to an act of the parliament, in 1650, although the act it∣self was unconstitutional and invalid, did not express the opinion of the wisest men in the nation, and even of the <HI>sons of liberty,</HI> at that time, with regard to the point in ques∣tion, when it declared, concerning the colonies, and plantations in <HI>America,</HI> that they had <Q>ever since the planting there∣of, been, and ought to be, subject to such laws, orders and regulations, as are or shall be made by the parliament of <HI>England?</HI></Q></P>
<P N="46">46. Whether the following acts <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> of the 12th, 15th, and 25th of <HI>Charles</HI> II.—
<PB N="16" REF="013222_0015_0F9046318DB2F1B8"/>
of the 7th and 8th of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and more particularly and act passed the same year, entitled, <Q>An act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses in the plan∣tations,</Q> and an act of the 11th, of the "same reign," for the trial of pirates in <HI>America,</HI> an act of the 9th of <HI>Queen Ann,</HI> for establishing the post-office in order that <Q>her Majesty may be <HI>supplied,</HI> and the <HI>re∣venue</HI> arising by the said office better <HI>im∣proved, settled and secured to her Majesty, her heirs and successors</HI></Q>—and the several acts made in the late reign, relating to the manufacturing of hats, the naturalization of foreigners, and rendering lands in <HI>Ameri∣ca</HI> assets, &amp;c. I say, whether such a succes∣sion of such acts does not afford compleat evidence, that the parliament has always claimed, and exercised, an unlimited juris∣diction over the colonies, whenever the oc∣casion was thought to require it?</P>
<P N="47">47. Whether in the late reign, when the assembly of <HI>Jamaica</HI> withheld the usual grants for the support of government in that island, and the ministry desired the opinion of those two eminent lawyers, Sir, <HI>Clement Wearg,</HI> and Sir <HI>Philip York,</HI> then attorney and solicitor general, on this point, whether the King, or his privy
<PB N="17" REF="013222_0016_0F9046323A9F81E0"/>
council, had not a right to levy upon the inhabitants the taxes that were wanted; they did not reply in the following words: <Q>That if <HI>Jamaica</HI> was still to be consider∣ed as a <HI>conquered</HI> island, the King had such a right; but if it was considered in the same light with the <HI>other colonies,</HI> no tax could be imposed on the inhabi∣tants, but by the assembly of the island, or <HI>by act of parliament.?</HI></Q></P>
<P N="48">48. Whether the right of parliament to impose taxes upon the colonies, which ap∣pears to have never been questioned in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> was not generally admitted in the co∣lonies, and the exercise of it thought ex∣pedient and necessary so very lately as in 1755?</P>
<P N="49">49. Whether the congress at <HI>Albany</HI> in that year, consisting of gentlemen of the first character from most of the colonies, did not approve of, and agree to, the pro∣posal of general <HI>Shirley,</HI> that <Q>application should be made to <HI>parliament, to empow∣er the committees</HI> of the several colonies to <HI>tax</HI> them, in proportion to their re∣spective abilities, in order to raise a ge∣neral fund for the common defence?</Q></P>
<P N="50"><PB N="18" REF="013222_0017_0F904633015A8AD8"/>
50. Whether, when Mr. <HI>Shirley's</HI> plan, including this proposal, was laid before the assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> it was not resolved by that house, after a proper discussion of all the particulars, <Q>That the scheme pro∣posed by governor <HI>Shirley,</HI> for the de∣fence of the <HI>British</HI> colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> is well concerted, and that this colony joins therein?</Q></P>
<P N="51">51. Whether it could have been the opi∣nion of general <HI>Shirley,</HI> or of the gentlemen at the congress, or of the house of assem∣bly in <HI>New-York,</HI> that the parliament could delegate a power to others, with which they were not vested themselves?</P>
<P N="52">52. Whether it has not been a standing maxim with our judges and lawyers, how∣ever some of them may have departed from it lately, that the original settlers of the colonies brought over with them the laws of <HI>England</HI> that were then in force, from which they were not released by any sub∣sequent charters; and that all acts of par∣liament that have passed since that period, in which the design of extending them to the colonies is expressed, have, and ought to have, the force and obligation of laws upon the colonies in general?</P>
<P N="53"><PB N="19" REF="013222_0018_0F904634A53E39B8"/>
53. Whether the utmost claim of the co∣lonies, at the time of the late <HI>stamp-act,</HI> was more than an exemptior from the autho∣rity of parliament, as far as it related to <HI>internal taxation, for the purpose of a re∣venue?</HI></P>
<P N="54">54. Whether it was not then allowed by the public advocates for <HI>American</HI> liber∣ty, that the parliament had a right to re∣gulate the trade of the colonies, and to lay duties both on their imports and ex∣ports<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The very respectable author of a leading pamphlet in those times, entitled, <HI>Considerations on the propriety of im∣posing taxes,</HI> &amp;c. declares his opinion in the following words. <Q>The subordination of the colonies, and the au∣thority of the parliament to preserve it, have been fully acknowledged. Not only the welfare, but perhaps the existence of the mother country, as an independent king∣dom, may depend upon her trade and navigation, and these (may depend) so far upon her intercourse with the colonies, that, if it should be neglected, there would soon be an end to that commerce, whence her greatest wealth is derived, and upon which her maritime power is principally founded. From these considera∣tions, the right of the <HI>British</HI> parliament, to regulate the trade of the colonies, may be justly deduced; a de∣nial of it would contradict the admission of the subordi∣nation, and of the authority to preserve it; resulting from the nature of the relation between the mother-country and her colonies. It is a common, and frequently <HI>the most proper method to regulate trade by duties on imports and exports.</HI> The authority of the mother-country to regu∣late the trade of the colonies being unquestionable, what regulations are most proper, are to be of course sub∣mitted to the determination of the parliament; and if an <HI>incidental revenue</HI> should be produced by such regu∣lations, these are not therefore unwarrantable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A right to impose an internal tax on the colonies, without their coment, <HI>for the single purpose of a revenue,</HI> is denied; a right to regulate their trade. <HI>without their consent,</HI> is admitted. The imposition of a duty may, in some instances, be the <HI>proper</HI> regulation. If the claims of the mother-country and the colonies should seem on such an occasion to interfere, and the point of right to be doubtful (which I take to be otherwise) it is easy to guess that the determination will be on the side of pow∣er, and that the inferior will be constrained to submit.</Q></P>
<P>The worthy author of the <HI>Pennsylvania Farmer's Letters.</HI> says, <Q>The parliament unquestionably possest a <HI>legal au∣thority</HI> to regulate the trade of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>all her colonies:</HI> Such an authority is essential to the relation be∣tween a mother-country and her colonies, and necessary for the common good of all. He who considers these provinces, as <HI>states distinct from the British empire,</HI> has very slender notions of justice, or of their interests: We are but <HI>parts of a whole,</HI> and therefore <HI>there must exist a power somewhere to preside and preserve the connection in due order; this power is lodged in the</HI> PARLIAMENT.</Q></P></NOTE>?</P>
<P N="55"><PB N="20" REF="013222_0019_0F90463565155110"/>
55. Whether the parliament, receding from, but not meaning to give up, the right of taxation, did not then meet the colonies upon their own ground, exercising no more than the right that had been ad∣mitted, of regulating their trade, and im∣posing duties upon a few of their own ex∣ports to the colonies?</P>
<P N="56"><PB N="21" REF="013222_0020_0F904639C6645A0"/>
56. Whether a regard to decency and consistency ought not to have produced in the <HI>Americans</HI> a quiet and peacable sub∣mission to an act, which was framed on the very principles that had been so lately established, in behalf of the colonies?—But,</P>
<P N="57">57. Whether the colonies did not then in∣troduce a new distinction, to take off the force of their former concessions, contend∣ing that duties laid upon the <HI>necessaries</HI> of life, such as paper, glass and paint (which, by the way, can be called necessaries only by a violent <HI>hyperbole</HI>) were <HI>equivalent</HI> to an internal tax, and therefore inadmis∣sible?</P>
<P N="58">58. Whether the parliament, in farther compliance with this distinction, did not then withdraw the duties they had laid upon <HI>such</HI> necessaries, reserving only as a mark of their authority to impose taxes, a small duty of three pence per pound, upon an article of sheer luxury, which can never be materially useful to any of the colonies, and which has been very hurtful to all of them, occasioning such an expensive man∣ner of living as the inhabitants in general are unable to afford?</P>
<P N="59"><PB N="22" REF="013222_0021_0F90463D18EA99E0"/>
59. Whether the opposition now made to this trifling duty, upon a hurtful luxury, is not as general, as vigorous, as clamor∣ous, and as injurious to private property, and the alarm of danger to our constituti∣onal rights, sounded with as much vehe∣mence and vociferation, as in the time of the stamp-act?</P>
<P N="60">60. Whether the facts here alluded to, following one another in so close a succes∣sion, do not amount to a clear proof, that every indulgence or concession granted to the colonies operates against the authority of parliament, as for every inch given from a principle of generosity, an ell is demand∣ed as matter of right; and whether the inference be not natural, that nothing less will satisfy the colonies, than an absolute renunciation of all claim of authority or ju∣risdiction, in the <HI>British</HI> parliament?</P>
<P N="61">61. Whether the maxim, that <HI>English∣men</HI> are bound by no laws but such as they consent to, either personally or by their re∣presentatives, has not been grossly misun∣derstood by our <HI>American</HI> patriots, and ve∣ry absurd inferences been drawn from it?</P>
<P N="62"><PB N="23" REF="013222_0022_0F90463D8AE5258"/>
62. Whether the <HI>English</HI> constitution does not make the king and parliament the representatives of all the people withing the kingdom, whether they be actual elec∣tors or non-electors?</P>
<P N="63">63. Whether a great part of the people in <HI>England</HI> can be said to give their consent to the laws that are made, by any other repre∣sentatives than these?</P>
<P N="64">64. Whether persons who have a right to vote in the election for members of par∣liament, are not often bound by laws, to which they consent in no shape, except as above-mentioned; they not approving of the laws; and even the members for the coun∣ty or borough in which they voted, oppos∣ing and protesting against the laws at the time of making them?</P>
<P N="65">65. Whether, for instance, a duty has not been laid upon hops, and an excise up∣on cyder, when the hop-growers, and the makers of cyder, and their friends in par∣liament, have used their utmost influence to prevent the passing of the law?</P>
<P N="66">66. Whether, therefore, the consent given by them to the law, was not a consent without their approbation or liking;
<PB N="24" REF="013222_0023_0F90463E4D56EAC0"/>
and whether such a consent, which is the only one given by many <HI>Englishmen,</HI> be the privilege for which the colonies contend?</P>
<P N="67">67. Whether therefore the maxim, that <HI>Englishmen</HI> are bound only by laws to which they consent, can be true, otherwise than of the nation <HI>collectively,</HI> or the body of the people, while great numbers of them are forced to submit to many laws with re∣luctance?</P>
<P N="68">68. Whether, if it were allowed to the colonies to send members to parliament of their own choosing, they would accept of the offer?</P>
<P N="69">69. Whether, while they would refuse to send members to parliament, they have any right to exclaim against acts of parlia∣ment, on account of their having no mem∣bers in parliament to represent them dis∣tinctly?</P>
<P N="70">70. Whether the privileges enjoyed by virtue of the <HI>English</HI> constitution of govern∣ment are not <HI>political</HI> privileges; and whe∣ther the <HI>natural</HI> right of the <HI>Americans</HI> can entitle them to the political privileges of

<HI>Englishmen,</HI> and more than to the political privileges of <HI>Dutchmen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This query is occasioned by the <HI>resolves</HI> of some of our former assemblies, and of some of our late county-commit∣tees, and by an <HI>English</HI> pamphlet, lately re-printed in <HI>New-York,</HI> entitled, <HI>Considerations on the measures carrying on with respect to the</HI> British <HI>colonies in</HI> America. The author of the pamphlet, who writes altogether <HI>ad populum,</HI> founds the claim of the <HI>Americans,</HI> first, upon the <HI>natural rights</HI> of mankind; secondly, upon the <HI>English</HI> constitution; and, thirdly, upon the provincial charters. He offers not much in support of the <HI>first</HI> of these points, because the position would not admit of much to be said in its favour; he says but very little in support of the <HI>second,</HI> because he has <HI>more respect</HI> for those able persons who have handled the subject before him, <HI>than to go over it again so much to its disadvan∣tage;</HI> and he says nothing at all upon the <HI>third,</HI> because he very judiciously thinks it best, to <HI>leave the particulars of this subject to themselves</HI> (the <HI>Americans</HI>) <HI>who are best ac∣quainted with them.</HI></NOTE>?</P>
<P N="71">71. Whether upon a review of the ar∣guments that have been used in favour of the colonies, it be reasonable to expect that the <HI>British</HI> parliament will be convinced by them; or that, without conviction, af∣ter their right to govern, and regulate the trade of the colonies; has been so inde∣cently questioned and denied, they will not assert it in such a way, as shall be thought most expedient and effectual.</P>
<P N="72">72. Whether an effectual support of the authority of parliament, after such a de∣nial of it, can be supposed to have so light
<PB N="26" REF="013222_0025_0F90463FD752B400"/>
an effect upon the property of <HI>Americans,</HI> as the small duty upon tea, if quietly sub∣mitted to, necessarily would have?</P>
<P N="73">73. Whether therefore those patriotic gentlemen, and patriotic <HI>labourers</HI> and <HI>me∣chanicks,</HI> who have urged on a greater evil, in order to avoid a less, are in reality, what∣ever they may have intended, friends to their country?</P>
<P N="74">74. Whether interested, designing men,—or men who court popularity as the great <HI>Sultana</HI> of their affections—or igno∣rant men, bred to the lowest occupations, who have no knowledge of the general prin∣ciples upon which civil society should be always established—are any of them qua∣lified for the direction of political affairs, or ought to be trusted with it?</P>
<P N="75">75. Whether the old rule, <HI>Ne futor ul∣tar crepidam,</HI> be not a good rule and pro∣per for this day?</P>
<P N="76">76. Whether the colonies, in a great mea∣sure, have not, for ten years past, been under an iniquitous and tyranical government, namely, the government of unprincipled <HI>mobs;</HI> and whether experience has not yet convinced us, that this made of governing a country is most detestable?</P>
<P N="77"><PB N="27" REF="013222_0026_0F9046408E305EB8"/>
77. Whether the <HI>sons of liberty</HI> have ever <HI>willingly</HI> allowed to others the liberty of thinking and acting for themselves; and whether any other liberty than that of doing as <HI>they</HI> shall direct, is to be expected during their administration?</P>
<P N="78">78. Whether it would not be safer, both to our liberty and property, to be under the authority of the <HI>British</HI> parliament, and sub∣ject to all those duties and taxes which they might think fit to impose, than to be under the government of the <HI>American sons of Liberty,</HI> without paying any duties or taxes at all?</P>
<P N="79">79. Whether the unavailing opposition that has been made to parliament, has not, since the commencement of the present year, been a greater expence to the <HI>Americans,</HI> if we allow for the neglect of business, and ex∣traordinary tavern expences, than all the duties with which the parliament would pro∣bably charge us, would amount to in fifty years?</P>
<P N="80">80. Whether if the <HI>British</HI> parliament should only leave us to ourselves, as some wise persons have seriously advised; or if we were able to compel them to submit to our own terms, which no wise person can imagine that we are; either event would not be as great a
<PB N="28" REF="013222_0027_0F90464160759DB8"/>
calamity to the colonies, in its natural conse∣quences, as the pestilence or a famine?</P>
<P N="81">81. Whether, without the superintending authority of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to restrain them, the colonies would not probably be soon at war among themselves; and whether with∣out the same authority to protect them, they would not probably soon become a prey to some foreign power.</P>
<P N="82">82. Whether, if the connexion of the co∣lonies with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> were dissolved, they must not immediately put themselves under the protection of some maritime power, less able to defend them, and less disposed to indulge their froward and petulant humour?</P>
<P N="83">83. Whether, in such a case, they would not be obliged to pay dearly for the protec∣tion afforded to their ships abroad, or to their sea-ports at home; and whether this would not be a much heavier burden, than that of the duties that have been demaned by the <HI>British</HI> parliament?</P>
<P N="84">84. Whether there can be any prospect of peace or safety to the colonies, while they are under the displeasure, and exposed to resentment of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI></P>
<P N="85">85. Whether therefore the reconciliation
<PB N="29" REF="013222_0028_0F90464217C3BD80"/>
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to her colonies be not a matter of capital and supreme importance, to promote which, every <HI>American</HI> is bound, in duty to his country; and as he values <HI>the peace of Jerusalem,</HI> to contribute his best wishes, prayers and endeavours?</P>
<P N="86">86. Whether every thing that tends to obstruct so desirable an event, ought not to be conscienciously avoided, and treated with abhorrence?</P>
<P N="87">87. Whether <HI>Great-Britain</HI> can be sup∣posed at present to be in such a condition, or of such a temper, as patiently to put up with our bullying and abusive language, to submit to our reproaches, or to be intimi∣dated with our threatenings?</P>
<P N="88">88. Whether on the other hand, the con∣tinuance of such provocations will not ne∣cessarily increase the indignation of a power that is irresistable by us, and render an ac∣commodation impracticable, but upon terms the most humiliating to the colonies?</P>
<P N="89">89. Whether the several colonies, by having chosen delegates to represent them at the congress, have not taken the matter in dispute out of the hands of the peo∣ple; and whether those, who, notwithstand∣ing, still endeavour farther to inflame the

<P N="90">90. Whether what is farther to be offered on the subject in dispute, should not be ad∣dressed to the gentlemen of the <HI>Congress,</HI> who are entrusted with, and answerable, in no small degree, both in this world and the next, for THE FATE OF THE COLONIES; and whether, in that case, if we mean not to affront them, cool and impartial represen∣tations and reasonings ought not to charac∣terise our future political productions?</P>
<P N="91">91. Whether full confidence ought not

<P N="92">92. Whether it be not time for our far∣mers and mechanicks, and labourers, to re∣turn to their business, and the care of their families; and all scrious Christians, to a sense of their duty?</P>
<P N="93">93. Whether it does not become us to employ the present interval of reflexion, in examining, how far the principles that have been propagated amongst us are conformable to reason, and productive of good or evil to society; and whether, in reality, they de∣serve to be countenanced or discouraged?</P>
<P N="94">94. Whether it would be amiss, at the same time, to consider, how far the Supreme Governor of the world, from whose juris∣diction no resolves of town-meetings can exempt us, may be supposed, from the de∣clarations he has made, to approve of our conduct?</P>
<P N="95">95. Whether the prosperity of states, and of all public societies, does not depend upon his blessing; and whether his blessing is to be otherwise expected, than in the way of conformity to his precepts?</P>
