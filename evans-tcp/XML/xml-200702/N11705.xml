<P>THE following discourse, honoured with your approbation, and brought into light by your request, has a natural right to your protection and countenance.</P>
<P>To reconcile seeming contradictions; to make self evident truths (flowing from the attributes of God, and loudly proclaimed by nature) agree with some plain declarations of scripture; to remove bigotry; to effect unanimity; and to serve the cause of truth and justice, was the occasion of its being written.

<BIBL>ROMANS XIII. 1. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>THE POWERS, THAT BE, <HI>are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT man is a peculiar object of supreme re∣gard, that his happiness and comfort have employed the attention of the almighty creator and preserver of the universe, is a truth so evident to all who will look round, attentively, that nothing but the blackest ingratitude and most un∣pardonable negligence can prevent their beholding and acknowledging. This, the whole face of na∣ture proclaims. Scarcely a visible object but man derives from it some use or convenience. Light and air, indeed, he enjoys in common with other animals; but numberless are the blessings which are peculiar to man: Even those very animals, which partake the common benefits, are subject to his controul and devoted to his use by their creator.</P>
<P>The dispensations of God likewise, all, declare his love: Even the corrections are proofs of his regard; for <HI>He chasteneth whom he loveth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</HI> The proofs of God's regard for man are, in short, so many, and so glaring in nature and the declarations of his
<PB N="06" REF="014793_0005_0F94A90B575FCB90"/>
word, that, a grateful mind, will readily acknow∣ledge whence all his happiness and blessings come.</P>
<P>Liberal minds have been, ever, studious to <HI>"vindicate the ways of God to man."</HI> They have been constant in asserting, that God, in his provi∣dence, is, uniformly, pursuing the one grand ob∣ject, <HI>the happiness of mankind.</HI> It is, likewise, an opinion which should readily obtain our belief, that he interests himself in every thing that concerns that happiness; and that his providence interposes whenever it is endangered. Nay, it is highly im∣pious, 'tis blasphemous, to suppose that every in∣terposition of God's providence is not from a bene∣volent motive, and with a view to general good.</P>
<P>It is a truth, fully confirmed by daily experi∣ence, that the happiness of mankind depends, in a great measure, on the well ordering of society; on a right administration of justice, and a due submission to wise and equitable laws. Since this is evident, beyond contradiction, it cannot be deemed an absurd supposition that the providence of God interposes in events of such importance as the political regulations and government of society; it is argument arising from the infinite goodness of God, and is confirmed to us by numerous proofs, of divine testimony; all which, clearly, evince the will and intentions of the deity; <HI>that man's welfare is the grand object of his dispensations; that, with this view, he constituted laws for them, and that, for this end, he appointed rulers over them.</HI> This reflection must occur to every one who will read the scriptures with becoming attention: But lest it may have escaped the observation of some who hear me, I shall lay before you a few remarkable
<PB N="07" REF="014793_0006_0F94A90C190CA4B8"/>
instances; from all which it will be evident, that <HI>the intentions of God, in the appointment of temporal rulers, was the advancement of general happiness: That the elevation and aggrandisement of those who were distinguished by him, proceeded from no partial attachment, but that they were chosen merely for their virtue and piety, and consequently, were better quali∣fied to answer the benevolent designs of the Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>One of the first instances (Genesis xli. ch.) of God's interposition, in the appointment of a tem∣poral ruler, is that of Joseph over the country of Egypt. It was, evidently, his discretion and wis∣dom that caused Pharaoh to promote him to that honour, who rightly judged, that none could be so wise and discreet as him, who had given the strongest proof of his possessing the spirit of God. It is beyond a doubt, that Joseph's exaltation was by divine appointment, and to answer the gracious purpose of rescuing from death not only Jacob and his house (with whom he had entered into cove∣nant) but to preserve Pharaoh and his people from the distresses of a severe famine.</P>
<P>The command given to Moses (Deuter. xvi. 18, 19, 20) when he was ordered to appoint judges and officers over the children of Israel, was, "<HI>Judges and officers shalt thou make thee, and they shall judge the people with</HI> JUST JUDGMENT. <HI>Thou shalt not wrest judgment, thou shalt not respect persons; that which is altogether just shalt thou follow.</HI>"</P>
<P>Among other commands which Moses received, respecting the king which God foresaw would be set up among the Israelites, he received this also (Deuter. xvii. 18 to the end) "<HI>And it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he
<PB N="08" REF="014793_0007_0F94A90CD53002E0"/>
shall write him a copy of this law in a book; and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God; to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; that his heart be not lifted up above his bre∣thren; and that he turn not aside from the command∣ment, to the right hand or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom.</HI>" These were the terms upon which favour and protection from Heaven were to be continued to rulers, even of DIVINE APPOINTMENT.</P>
<P>God's dealings with Saul, the first person ap∣pointed king over Israel, were exactly after these conditions. Success and victory were the fruits of his labours, whilst he turned not aside from the <HI>holy commandment delivered.</HI> But the prophet Samuel tells us (1 Samuel, xv. ch.) <HI>when he turned back from following the Lord, the Lord also rejected him from being king.</HI> His successour, David, by a more faithful administration, continued to enjoy the kingdom to a good old age, and procured a con∣ditional promise of it to his posterity. This great and good man, far from being elated at the dis∣tinction shewn him by God, saw, clearly, the true reason of his promotion and the purpose of God in appointing him: This he confessed when he was anointed king in Hebron, and repeats among the last words which he spoke. The pro∣phet Samuel tells us (2 Samuel, v. 12) <HI>"David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom</HI> FOR HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL'S SAKE." In his dying hour he declared (2 Samuel, xxiii. 3) <HI>"He that ruleth over men must be just; ruling in the fear of God."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="09" REF="014793_0008_0F94A90D98408EA0"/>
The queen of Sheba blessed God, <HI>who delighted to set Solomon on his throne. "Because,"</HI> said she, <HI>"thy God loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice."</HI> (2 Chron. ix. 8)</P>
<P>With these scriptures, the spirit which runs through the whole of the evangelical writings, coincides to prove that the blessings derived to mankind by the Christian dispensation, proceeded from the same divine principle of love. <HI>"Herein is love,"</HI> says the apostle John (1 John iv. 10) <HI>"not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins."</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the love of God to man is so loudly proclaimed by the voice of nature, and the benevolence of his intentions so clearly revealed in his word, and declared in all his dispensations; yet there are not wanting in the world, those, who though they cannot but assent to the general truths, here asserted, yet deny them in effect. By asserting that contrary opinions are more agreeable to the word and will of God, and more favourable to the happiness of mankind, they deny, in substance, what is demonstrably proved to be true. They insist that, though rulers are bound to govern according to the immutable laws of equity, yet an obligation lies on Christians to pay an exact obedience to <HI>all their commands:</HI> That no abuse of power will justify disobedience; and, however contrary their laws may be to the benevolent de∣signs of the creator, that Christians are bound to observe them with the most strict conformity.</P>
<P>They agree that God's care and attention is em∣ployed for the welfare of his creatures. They
<PB N="10" REF="014793_0009_0F94A90E54209298"/>
admit that social regulations and the preservation of order are necessary; and that the administration of justice is essential to peace and security. They agree with us as to the end, but differ concerning the mode; while the mode they contend for, is, as we humbly conceive, destructive of that very end which all good men desire, and for which government was, at first, established.</P>
<P>The advocates for despotism and an implicit obedience contend, that the licentious and refrac∣tory disposition of man requires a restraint which only an uncontroulable power can lay upon him: That a sense of honour, of religious obligations, and regard for his fellow creatures, are motives too weak to influence him when his own desires and interest interfere: And that no power, but one independent and uncontroulable, would make laws sufficiently rigorous to secure the peace of society. They insist that popular governments are insufficient for this end; as popular and other un∣worthy motives, too often induce men to propose laws that are destructive, from their lenity. That it is necessary an implicit obedience should be paid to every law of their imposing, in order to pre∣serve the authority of the legislature; without which, say they, order must cease, peace be destroyed, and justice interrupted.</P>
<P>To give farther weight to these opinions, they add, that the all-wise God, foreseeing the best method of conducting human affairs, has declared, in his revealed will, <HI>it shall be so;</HI> and, among other proofs, they bring in support of their doctrine the words of my text; which, they say, amount to a full proof, that God commands and expects
<PB N="11" REF="014793_0010_0F94A910A26E1258"/>
us to follow, implicity and blindly, every dictate of our superiours.</P>
<P>That God requires obedience from his people, to all laws that are equitable: That he expects them to be obedient to magistrates and rulers, when <HI>their commands</HI> do not contradict <HI>his own,</HI> is, undoubtedly, true, and abundantly confirmed by his word: But I hope to be excused when I can∣not agree with them, that mankind are to follow every dictate of their superiours, without doubting or murmuring. It is a principle so slavish, that no man who considers himself in his true light, as descended from the common parent of his species, can assent to. It is a doctrine so full of danger tending to destroy every distinction between right and wrong, and to make justice or injustice depend upon passion and caprice: It is a principle so de∣structive in itself; tending so greatly, to debase the human mind, and to extinguish every virtuous effort, that if deserves to be rejected by every friend of truth and mankind: And I doubt not to prove, from the example of St. Paul's conduct, that he never meant, by the declaration in my text, to give sanction to the crimes of wicked and despotick men.</P>
<P>But it may be said, <HI>you would, then, have those to be judges of right and wrong, from whom nothing is required but obedience; you would have those, to govern, whom the laws were intended to restrain: How will such a mode answer the important point you contend for; the preservation of order and justice? A system of this kind, gives an opening for the most flagitious and licentious practices; which, instead of securing,
<PB N="12" REF="014793_0011_0F94A912943AA278"/>
must destroy that peace and harmony you recommend.</HI> I would wish to have it believed, that I am, by no means, an advocate for anarchy. I am, very fully, convinced of the necessity of subordination in society, in order to its happiness: But I must, still, think, that this happiness is not best promoted by a scheme of despotism. Was infallibility con∣veyed to man with the powers of government, I would instantly subscribe to the doctrine. But, unhappily for human nature, we see the old Latin proverb <HI>(humanum est errare)</HI> verified daily; and if any conclusions may be drawn from the practice and policy of courts and princes, through all ages of the world, we may venture to affirm that, abundantly more determinations have proceeded from selfishness and ambition, than from disinte∣rested and benevolent motives.</P>
<P>Ignorance, darkness and superstition, have, ever, had their source in oppression and injustice; while truth and science have been the constant attendants upon liberty. The spirit of freedom will, indeed, sometimes, if accompanied with imprudent con∣duct in rulers, be attended with disagreeable con∣sequences: But, few instances can be shewn where these consequences have followed, when the publick good alone has influenced the councils of princes. Mankind can, in general, distinguish between right and wrong; between justice and oppression; where they see their rulers actuated by principles of benevolence and a love of justice, there needs little else, than this confidence, to se∣cure their obedience: And how happy have those periods been, where sentiments, of mutual obli∣gation and duty, have subsisted between rulers
<PB N="13" REF="014793_0012_0F94A91346342668"/>
and their subjects. But how miserable the state of that people, whose prince, disdaming the ties of humanity and justice, trampling on their most sacred rights, and sporting with their wretched∣ness, impiously conceits himself the anointed of God, and dares to presume on the authority of Heaven to sanctify his crimes.</P>
<P>From the proneness of man's heart to selfishness and ambition, little pains need be taken to per∣suade him to the belief of opinions that are favour∣able to his views and inclinations; the many mis∣chiefs which have arisen in the would from the successful arts of sycophants are too notorious to be denied: Much happier would it be for mankind, were princes and rulers, taught, faithfully, to be∣lieve these truths, <HI>that no character, however digni∣fied, can give sanction to inhumanity and oppression; that justice and benevolence are principles of universal obligation; that a mutual obligation subsists between the governed and their rulers; that the happiness of mankind is the end of their appointment; and that the uprightness of their conduct will be their best security for the favour of Heaven and the obedience of their sub∣jects.</HI> Where princes are not deeply impressed with a sense of these truths, we may expect nei∣ther peace nor happiness where they rule.</P>
<P>If we recur to experience, for satisfaction con∣cerning this doctrine, what will that teach us? Will it prove that truth and justice have prevailed, more, in free countries? Or, that ignorance and errour have been the insepa∣rable attendants on freedom? Will it not, on the contrary, be evident, that in kingdoms where these principles have been established, the most
<PB N="14" REF="014793_0013_0F94A91395CD11E8"/>
insolent tyranny, and most violent oppressions, have been exercised upon the wretched subject by his lordly ruler? This is a truth, with which the world is, but too well, acquainted. How great a part of mankind are, at this day, smarting un∣der the iron rod of power, and all the calamities which oppression can devise, or tyranny inflict, no one can be ignorant of who is, in the least ac∣quainted with the affairs of the world.</P>
<P>And can we suppose, that God is displeased with those unhappy nations who, when stimulated to complaints by the bitter lash of oppression, utter their disquietude before him? Did he reprove that distinguished people the Israelites, for complaining of the severe treatment of Pharaoh, who <HI>made their lives bitter with hard bondage?</HI> Did he expect that they should pay a blind obedience to all his ordi∣nances? Did he rebuke their murmurs, or refuse to hear their complaints? Surely neither: <HI>"I have seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,</HI> says God to Moses (Exodus iii. ch.) <HI>and have heard their cry, by reason of their task-masters: For I know their sorrows, and am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians."</HI> What a deliverance he wrought for those murmurers and complainers; and what judgment was exercised on their oppres∣sors, the sacred book of God declares.</P>
<P>Upon a review of the subject; and from consi∣dering the many arguments that convince us of God's gracious disposition towards man: From considering him as impartial and dispassionate; that he has, manifestly, in his revealed will, de∣clared his intentions in appointing temporal rulers, and, clearly, pointed out for them a line of con∣duct,
<PB N="15" REF="014793_0014_0F94A9145418C298"/>
from which they may not deviate without incurring his displeasure; I cannot be induced to believe, that God will be angry with his creatures for disregarding the injunctions of those who have departed from that rule of rectitude laid down by him, and who would force them into measures, which, they are convinced, are neither for the advancement of his glory nor their own happiness.</P>
<P>Nor can I, upon a candid inquiry, admit that St. Paul meant, by the words of my text, to enjoin Christians the practice of this doctrine. In order to understand him rightly, let us compare the doctrine with his own practices. It would hardly be supposed, of Paul, that he would prac∣tise any thing that was contrary to the truths he was preaching: That an apostle of Jesus Christ, who was desiring others to walk <HI>as they had him for an example,</HI> would, by the pattern of his life, lead mankind into fatal errours. Yet, we find it re∣corded, in the Acts of the Apostles, that this very man, when apprehended and punished wrongfully and contrary to the laws and usages of the Romans, to which nation he was subject, and entitled to all the privileges of one of their free citizens, did not, tacitly and submissively, endure it, but com∣plained aloud of their injustice; and appealed to the laws and constitution of his country. We are told (Acts xxii. ch.) that the chief captain of the Roman garrison, in order to satisfy the Jews, was about to examine Paul by scourging, and had ordered him to be bound with throngs for that purpose; but we do not find that the apostle sub∣mitted to his authority, implicitly and without complaining: No; he condemned this conduct,
<PB N="16" REF="014793_0015_0F94A9151ED81E40"/>
as unjust and tyrannical, and appealed to the Ro∣man constitution for that justice which he was not like to meet with from the officer. "<HI>Is it law∣ful for you,</HI> says he to the centurion, <HI>to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</HI> This re∣monstrance had the expected effect; for we are told, <HI>the chief captain was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound him;</HI> and, the next day, he was loosed from his bands.</P>
<P>When the high priest commanded Paul to be smitten on the mouth, for asserting that, he had lived in all good conscience, before God, until that day; he replied, "<HI>God shall smite thee, thou whited wall, for sittest thou to judge me</HI> AFTER THE LAW, <HI>and condemnest thou me</HI> CONTRARY TO THE LAW?" By which saying he has, clearly marked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the line of conduct for those in power; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> time, left the most bitter and morti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> reproof to those who have not exercised their authority agreeable to this rule.</P>
<P>In the sixteenth chapter of the Acts, we are told <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when the magistrates of Philippi, sent to dismiss Paul and Silas privately, after they had beaten them openly and uncondemned, who were Romans: they, absolutely refused to obey the command: <HI>Nay verily,</HI> says St. Paul, <HI>but let them come, themselves, and fetch us out:</HI> Nor did they go till the magistrates <HI>came and besought them, and brought them out; and desired them to depart out of the city.</HI> Here is, beyond contradiction, an instance where this very Paul, who is said to have recom∣mended passive obedience to Christians, absolutely refused to obey the command of magistrates. The reason, why he did, is obvious; he meant to re∣prove
<PB N="17" REF="014793_0016_0F94A915F9778C40"/>
prove them for the unjust punishment, inflicted on him and Silas; and for exercising their autho∣rity in a tyrannical manner.</P>
<P>Again, when Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, would have sent Paul up to Jerusalem, to be tried there, he loudly exclaimed against it; well knowing, how little justice he might hope for in that city. <HI>I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, said he</HI> (Acts xxv. ch.) <HI>where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou, very well, knowest: For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing, worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me,</HI> NO MAN MAY DELIVER ME UNTO THEM: <HI>I appeal unto Caesar.</HI> Here he, positively, denied Festus's right to do what the Jews required; and appeals, for justice, to the laws of his country; well knowing that, by them, no man could be delivered to death, <HI>before that he which is accused have the accusers</HI> FACE TO FACE, <HI>and have license to</HI> ANSWER FOR HIMSELF, <HI>concerning the crime laid against him.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the practice of that Paul, of whom it is asserted that he taught the doctrine of passive obedience. That he, ever, paid the most scrupu∣lous obedience to the established and just laws of the various nations he travelled through, is reason∣able to suppose. But that he endeavoured to im∣press Christians with the belief that, they were to obey, implicitly, every dictate of power, however unjust and oppressive, and however contrary to the divine will and intentions, is hardly to be imagined; because it is, as we have instanced,
<PB N="18" REF="014793_0017_0F94A9169377C3C0"/>
inconsistent with his own conduct at Caesarea, at Philippi and at Jerusalem.</P>
<P>St. Peter beseeches us to submit ourselves, <HI>to every ordinance of man.</HI> But are we, hence, to in∣fer that this is without any exception whatever; or that Christians are to pay no regard to the rec∣titude of those laws, of human authority, to which they pay obedience? This, certainly, never could have been St. Peter's meaning: for we find (Acts iv. ch.) that when he and John were forbid preaching, by the high priest and rulers, they actually refused to comply. <HI>"Whether it be right,</HI> IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, say they, <HI>to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."</HI> But it may be said, these men were acting by immediate com∣mand from their saviour; and where his com∣mand is positive, man's is not to be regarded. To which it may be answered: whenever oppres∣sion and injustice are exercised by the ruling pow∣ers, the commands of God are broken: That God expects no obedience of his people to those who live in daily violation of his commands; who de∣stroy, by their acts of power, the cause of truth and the happiness of mankind; and pervert, by their nefarious systems, the very design of social regulations. If we would understand St. Peter, rightly, let us consider the whole of what he says, upon this subject, together (1 Peter ii. ch.) <HI>"Sub∣mit yourselves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the king, as supreme, or unto governours, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well."</HI> The divine intention in the appoint∣ment of temporal rulers, is, here, evidently, de∣clared
<PB N="19" REF="014793_0018_0F94A91A430A9850"/>
to be for the happiness of society, to restrain vice and cherish virtue: And while they act conformably to the divine will, 'tis, doubtless, the duty of every Christian a be obedient to their authority. But when they mistake their commis∣sion, when evil doers get rewards instead of pu∣nishment, and the good meet persecution instead of praise; when, not justice, but power and self aggrandisement are the objects of their pursuit; when ambition prompts, not humanity and bene∣volence; when passion rules unrestrained, and the voice of reason is drowned by the clamours of sense, will any body, under such circumstances, say that it is the duty of Christians to pay an entire obedi∣ence to their superiours, or to consent to, and be aiding in the execution of their wicked purposes? If the example of apostles should have any influ∣ence over us, doubtless no obedience is due, from Christians, to the impious and unlawful commands of their superiours.</P>
<P>To apply this doctrine to our own case, and the circumstances of the present times, it will be ne∣cessary to consider it in another light. Hitherto, I have considered it as it respects nations where princes are allowed an absolute domination; where the power of legislation is vested, solely, in the chief magistrate. And if in countries, so circum∣stanced, resistance, or a disregard to laws, in cer∣tain cases, is not only justifiable, but a necessary duty; how much more justifiable is resistance in a limited monarchy, where the people have an equal share of <HI>the powers that be;</HI> that power which is ordained of God; the power of legislation? The
<PB N="20" REF="014793_0019_0F94A91A5F9017E8"/>
free exercise of which is the only security that can be found against oppression and injustice.</P>
<P>As St. Paul has asserted, in my text, that <HI>the powers which be are ordained of God;</HI> it will be ne∣cessary, in order to ascertain the line of obedience, to know in what hands power is lodged by the constitution of our country. The nature of this constitution having been frequently and fully ex∣plained of late, by able pens; and the privileges of the subject clearly pointed out; I shall spend no time in expatiating on its excellencies and the blessings which flow from it to mankind. It is sufficient, for my present purpose, to say, that by the constitution of England, the lives, liberty and property of every individual are secured: That the commons, or the body of the people, make one branch of the legislature; and have a share of power: That they have not only the power of keeping and enjoying securely, peaceably, and at their discretion the fruits of their honest industry, but also the power of making laws by their repre∣sentatives, <HI>by themselves chosen;</HI> and that they are accountable to no laws but such as they in this manner assent to. It is a fact, agreed to on all hands, that the subject of England is vested with a share of power and legislation; and that, whilst he chooses to keep it, no earthly power can, law∣fully, deprive him of this privilege. Allowing St. Paul's assertion to be true, then, in the most lite∣ral and confined sense that any despot would choose to affix to it, it does not appear that, in the present contest between Great Britain and her colonies, the colonists are resisting a power ordain∣ed of God, a power to whom they owe obedience,
<PB N="21" REF="014793_0020_0F94A91B1B0D3B60"/>
an authority they are subjected to by the constitu∣tion of their country. The dispute, as I conceive, is, <HI>whether the king's subjects in America, their lives and property, are at the</HI> ABSOLUTE DISPOSAL <HI>of the king and his subjects in England? Whether the legislature of Great Britain has a right to make laws, binding of America,</HI> IN ALL CASFS WHATSOEVER? The colonists think that, if this be the case, their situation is truly slavish, and are justly alarmed for the consequences. They contend that their fellow subjects in Britain are but their equals: That the power ordained of God; that share of power which exists in the people, is, equally, the privilege of every individual subject: They insist that a Bri∣ton cannot boast a single blessing from the constitu∣tion, but what an American is, equally, entitled to: They say the claim of the commons of Britain is an innovation; that it is unnatural, unjust and oppressive; and destructive of that equal justice and liberty which, by the constitution, was meant to be secured to all. While, therefore, the colo∣nists are contending with their equals, only; with those who are ordained to have no greater share of power than themselves: While they refuse obedience to those who have no right to exact it; and assert their rights when it would be highly criminal to resign them: those rights which God has appointed them and the laws confirmed; I cannot be of opinion that they may be charged, justly, with a breach of God's ordinances.</P>
<P>Were the people of the colonies labouring to subvert the constitution; to abolish monarchy, or even to diminish the just prerogative of the crown, they might, truly, be said to be resisting the or∣dinances
<PB N="22" REF="014793_0021_0F94A91BD426A548"/>
of God. But, upon an impartial exami∣nation, it does not appear to be the case: For whatever may be the wish of individuals, the bo∣dy of the people are firm in their attachment to the constitution; and all the great representative bodies have warmly declared their loyalty, and an utter aversion to a change of government. In all their petitions and remonstrances, to the King and legislature of Britain, they say their only wish is to have their former privileges and liberties con∣firmed. While, therefore, an opposition is carried on upon the principle of self-defence. While they contend for the preservation of that power which alone can render them secure and happy: While they do not aim at innovation, or to infringe the rights of others, the colonists cannot, with the least degree of justice, be charged with resisting the ordinances of God. The colonists, as St. Paul was, are not free by purchase but by birth: Though not born in Britain, are as much entitled to the privileges of Englishmen, as St. Paul was to those of a Roman citizen, though born at Tarsus. Like him, too, they have asserted their claim and appealed to the constitution of their country for relief from the arbitrary will of man. But alas, their plea is rejected; it, therefore, rests with the infallible judge to decide the controversy <HI>as to him seemeth good.</HI></P>
<P>I am aware of the objection which the enemies of American freedom are constantly urging in fa∣vour of their pretensions. In my opinion, the doctrine of transubstantiation is not a greater ab∣surdity than the notion of America's being repre∣sented in the British parliament. To attempt a
<PB N="23" REF="014793_0022_0F94A91C96496608"/>
refutation of this incomprehensible doctrine would be vain: The voice of reason and of justice are too feeble to be heard amidst the clamours of am∣bition and interest. Many members of the British senate have, of late, interested themselves greatly to procure relief from subscription to the articles of our church; and for this reason, principally, that the doctrines they contain are incomprehensible and absurd: Yet those very members, who wish to be excused from acknowledging, publickly, truths which they cannot comprehend, would compel the colonists to subscribe doctrines, which, they are convinced, are neither just nor true. Conscience <HI>may</HI> prompt the one, but the <HI>impartial</HI> world can be at no loss to determine what in∣fluences the other resolution. So blind is human nature to its own failings; so deaf to the cries of honour and justice, when self interferes, that what is just one day is most unjust the next; what, at one time, is truth, is at another time errour.</P>
<P>Upon the principle of self, alone, can the conduct of the enemies of America be reconciled. The voice of God, of truth, of justice, of humanity, are, totally, against it.</P>
<P>Sophistry may guild over the fashionable doctrine of expediency, which is, now, become a substi∣tute for truth and justice: We may be told of the <HI>"dignity, safety and welfare of the British empire."</HI> But can the most flagrant injustice add dignity to a state? Is the safety of a nation increased by a diminution of affection and confidence among the subjects? Or will the decrease of commerce add any thing to its welfare? And will any body say that Christians are obliged to submit, tacitly, to
<PB N="24" REF="014793_0023_0F94A91E4EB18150"/>
measures so inconsistent and destructive; to obey, passively, schemes of expediency and human policy which contradict the laws of justice and humanity? If the laws of God are more to be revered than those of man's invention, surely the Christian is to be justified in rejecting whatever is contrary to divine precept.</P>
<P>There, never, was a time when it was more necessary to consider the truth of the doctrine laid before you than the present. It has, long, per∣plexed the minds of many pious and well disposed persons, who have been fluctuating between duty to God and to themselves; and so long as they have acted from conscientious motives, and have endeavoured to make the laws of God the rule of their actions, their conduct is highly commend∣able. But it is high time that the mists of errour should be removed from the eyes of every Ame∣rican, from every friend to truth and justice; that while selfish and unworthy motives actuate some, others may not be prevented, by bigotry, from uniting in the most important cause that ever en∣gaged their concern.</P>
<P>I would not be thought to stand here, <HI>"a mo∣ver of sedition"</HI> or an advocate for licentiousness. It would ill become this sacred place, and the character of a minister of the gospel of Christ, to inspirit rebellion and foment disorder and confusion: But it becomes us, highly, to remove every im∣pediment from the progress of truth and justice to espouse the cause of humanity and the common rights of mankind. In a particular manner, it becomes us to vindicate that holy religion we pro∣fess; which does not seem altogether free from
<PB N="25" REF="014793_0024_0F94A91F4866FC58"/>
danger since some late regulations in Britain. The temporal concerns of mankind claim the last regard of a Christian: Things which end with this life, they should regard with the <HI>indifference of a guest that tarrieth but a day:</HI> But the cause of truth, immutable and eternal, should engage their warm∣est and unremitted attention. The cause of an innocent and helpless posterity; of millions, yet unborn, plead strongly for the utmost exertion of our care and vigilance, in defence of their rights: And gratitude to the memory of our ancestors, should inspire an awful reverence for that noble cause they have so often stood forth to defend, and which, through their glorious efforts (under God) has been, to this day, preserved.</P>
<P>To look towards futurity and contemplate pos∣sible events, is, at this day, painful: The most consolatory reflection we now have, is, that the cause of truth and justice is the cause of God, and that his almighty arm is irresistible. From the example of past times we may, likewise, draw consolation; the history of which proves, that zeal and unanimity, in a righteous cause, have often been an overmatch for numbers and power. Next to divine protection, let us place our hopes in, and exert all our faculties to effect this most desirable object. Let no man strive, but who shall, best, serve the cause of truth and his coun∣try. Let distinctions and prejudices cease; and let the flame of patriotism, alone, blaze out to an excess. O that it may rise to such height and power in the bosom of every American, as to con∣sume
<PB N="26" REF="014793_0025_0F94A92001B0B188"/>
every engine and render uneffectual every effort of injustice, tyranny and oppression.</P>
<P>May that great and gracious being, whose friend∣ly aid and interposition are essential to the happiness of his creatures, benignly smile upon the cause of the injured and oppressed, the bless all our virtu∣ous endeavours. May civil discord cease: And may peace, with all its usual blessings, be again restored; never to be interrupted by an unfriendly and unnatural contest between Great Britain and her colonies.</P>
<P>For the sake of Jesus Christ. AMEN.</P>
