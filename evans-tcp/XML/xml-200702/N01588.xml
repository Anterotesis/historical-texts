<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>New-English</HI> BRIDGWATER has been a Town favoured of GOD; yea, some Favours of Heaven unto it, have indeed been distinguishing.</P>
<P>It was <HI>planted a Noble Vine.</HI>— And may no more of the Text from whence this Phrase is borrowed, ever be applied unto it! The <HI>First Planters</HI> of it, were a sett of People, who made RELIGION their main <HI>Interest</HI>; and it be∣came their <HI>Glory.</HI> There was a Time▪ when it stood in a <HI>Land of unwalled Vill<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages,</HI> with fierce Armies of Bloody <HI>Indians</HI> destroying round about them; And the Dispensations of GOD our SAVIOUR towards it at <HI>this time,</HI> were so won∣derful, that the short Report thereof given in, <HI>The Church-History of New-England,</HI> is not un∣worthy to be here transcribed and repeated.</P>
<Q><P>Remarkable was the Fate of <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> a most <HI>Praying,</HI> and a most <HI>Pious</HI> Town, seated in the very <HI>midst</HI> of the Dangers of the <HI>War;</HI> that altho' they were often assaulted by formidable
<PB N="ii" REF="001888_0003_0FB9C6C33971FA78"/>
Numbers of the Enemies, yet in all their sharp Assaults, they <HI>never lost one</HI> of their Inhabi∣tants, Young or Old. They were sollicited strong∣ly to desert their Dwellings: but they resolved, that they would keep their <HI>Stations.</HI> And now on <HI>May 8. 1676.</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> began to Fire the Town; but the Inhabitants with notable Courage, issued forth from their Garrisons, to fight the Enemy; and <HI>GOD from Heaven</HI> at the same time fought for them, with a Storm of <HI>Lightning, Thunder, and Rain,</HI> whereby a considerable part of their Houses were preserved. Thou, Church of <HI>Bridgwater,</HI></P>
<P><HI>O niminus dilecta Deo, cui militat aether.</HI> One that was no <HI>Christian,</HI> so sang the Favours of Heaven to the Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI>; and so might the <HI>Pagan</HI> Foe now sing of thy Salvations!</P></Q>
<P>Ever since that memorable Day, the Town has been proceeding, with the Smile of GOD upon them, and upon the Intentions of His Gospel among them, until they are <HI>now become Two Bands.</HI> They are Lovingly and Peaceably swarmed into a <HI>New Assembly,</HI> and began to meet in their <HI>New Edifice</HI> on a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> (as 'tis the manner of <HI>New-England,</HI>) when the Two SERMONS were Preached, which the affected Hearers have here Published. GOD grant, that from the Tokens of His Gracious Presence with them, the Place may claim the Name of, <HI>Mahanaim</HI>▪ And may there be still found among them such a Number of Lively, Watch∣ful,
<PB N="iii" REF="001888_0004_0FB9C6C6AAF43740"/>
<HI>Fruitful Christians,</HI> Exemplarily <HI>Living to GOD,</HI> and <HI>by the Faith of the Son of GOD</HI>; May a <HI>value</HI> for the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR, be so preserved in Vigour with them, and the <HI>Success</HI> thereof appear in all <HI>Real and Vital Godliness</HI> quickened among the <HI>Young</HI> as well as the <HI>Old</HI> among them; And may their <HI>Brother∣ly-Love continue</HI> at such a rate, that it may be plainly seen, GOD is yet among them. <HI>Wo to them, if I depart from them, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It has been a singular Felicity unto this Good People, that from the very Infancy of their Plan∣tation, they have satt under the Ministry of a Gra∣cious, Faithful, Humble Servant of GOD, who <HI>continues with them to this Day.</HI> He has been a Precious <HI>Gift</HI> of our <HI>Ascended</HI> LORD un∣to them; and they have hitherto <HI>Rejoyced in his Light;</HI> and <HI>We</HI> Rejoyce with them, that after Fifty Four Years, his <HI>Light</HI> yet shines with such Brightness among them.</P>
<P>We can make no Doubt, but that, as they have grown into such Good Circumstances under his painful and patient conduct, they will study in all the Methods if Goodness, to render his <HI>Old Age</HI> comfortable to him, and so multiply all the Offices and Expressions of a <HI>Grateful People</HI> towards him, with an Affection and Reverence, like what the Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI> paid unto their Aged <HI>Po∣lycarp,</HI> that he may anon Die, Blessing of them,
<PB N="iv" REF="001888_0005_0FB9C6C86DBEE060"/>
and Blessing of GOD for them. They will cer∣tainly find their Account in doing so!</P>
<P>The Savoury SERMON, which is here Extor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> for the Publick from him, as well as that of his Reverend Neighbour, who has also for many Years been a Rich Blessing to the Churches in his Neigh∣hood; we recommend unto the Blessing of GOD that so the <HI>Ends of Piety,</HI> which the Good People have proposed in thus Exhibiting a lasting <HI>Memo∣rial</HI> of what GOD has done for them, and a con¦stant <HI>Remembrancer</HI> of their Duty, may be answered.</P>

<HEAD>A Case of <HI>Prayer,</HI> handled on a Day of <HI>Prayer.</HI> By <HI>JAMES KEITH. BRIDGWATER,</HI>
August 14. 1717.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EZEKIEL XXXVI.37.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of, by the House of Is∣rael, to do it for them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Shall not insist upon the Division of this Chapter, into the several parts of it; Only we may consider for an In∣troduction to the Text, that from the four and twentieth verse to the close of the Chapter, we have a Number of <HI>exceeding great and precious Promises</HI> made to <HI>Israel</HI>; Promises both of Spiritual and Temporal Blessings. In the first place, there are Promises made to
<PB N="2" REF="001888_0007_0FB9C6CB8D6BAF28"/>
them of a <HI>new Heart</HI> and a <HI>right Spirit,</HI> pro∣mises of <HI>Pardoning Mercy,</HI> and promises of Con∣verting and Sanctifying Grace; and there∣unto we have an addition of Promises re∣specting <HI>Temporal Blessings,</HI> the blessings of <HI>In∣crease,</HI> the Increase of Men, the blessings of <HI>Peace,</HI> of quietness and safety in their Dwel∣lings; the Blessings of plentiful Provision in the increase of the Field, and the fruit of the Trees. After a long Enumeration of Divine Blessings, the Lord shews them in our Text, <HI>what is to be done</HI> on their part in order to the obtaining of the great Blessings he doth pro∣mise to bestow upon them.</P>
<P>We may consider the Text, as it contains a solemn Declaration; and therein we have,</P>
<P>First: The <HI>Author</HI> of it, and that is <HI>the Lord.</HI> That which we have in the Text was publish∣ed and declared in a ministerial way, by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> by divine Inspiration and di∣vine Authority; so the Text expresseth, <HI>Thus saith the Lord God</HI>; It was from the Great and Glorious <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Self-Existing, the In∣finite and Eternal Being, the Fountain of all being and blessedness.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have the <HI>Object,</HI> unto whom this Declaration is directed, and that is <HI>The House of Israel,</HI> the Family, the Posterity of <HI>Israel</HI>; who were separated from the rest of the Nations, and taken into special Covenant
<PB N="3" REF="001888_0008_0FB9C6CDA2661F30"/>
Relation unto God. As this is firstly and more immediately directed to the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> so it is of concernment unto <HI>all the Is∣rael of God,</HI> unto all the Churches and People of God thorow all Generations.</P>
<P>Thirdly. We have the <HI>way</HI> and <HI>means</HI> to be attended in order to the Enjoyment of the good which God hath promised to bestow; and therein we have</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Duty</HI> enjoyned. <HI>I will yet be en∣quired of by the House of Israel</HI>: That Enquiry must be made by <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication</HI> to God, not in a slight superficial way, but with great <HI>earnestness</HI> and so with <HI>perseverance</HI> in <HI>Prayer; Prayer</HI> notwithstanding delays as to the Accomplishment of Promises: <HI>I will yet be enquired of by the House of Israel</HI>; It must be a careful and diligent Enquiry as Criticks observe from the Hebrew Word <HI>Daresh.</HI> Such must the Enquiry be, of those that would pre∣vail with God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have the <HI>Good</HI> to be sought for from the Lord; <HI>For this I will be enquired of that I may do it for them,</HI> i. e. that I may per∣form my Word to them, that the <HI>Promises</HI> of Mercy and Blessing I have made to them may have their Accomplishment. That which is to be sought for is here expressed in the <HI>Sin∣gular Number.</HI> We find in Scripture phrase, the Singular Number put for the <HI>Plural,</HI> as em∣phatical
<PB N="4" REF="001888_0009_0FB9C6CE705E37A8"/>
and more comprehensive; and so [<HI>This</HI>] may be taken as comprehending not only that particular promise immediately pre∣ceeding the Text, but all the foregoing Pro∣mises; But whether we take the Word [This] in a large or strict sense, the Text will afford this plain genuine <HI>Doctrine,</HI></P>
<P><TEXT>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>That as the Lord hath made Promises of great Blessings to his People, so he will be enquired of by them; he will be sought to in the way of Prayer and Supplication in order to the perfor∣mance of that which he hath promised, that he may do it for them.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>This is that which God expects from his People, this is that he hath obliged them to, as to all the Good which he hath promised to bestow upon them; This is the great <HI>Means</HI> which God hath instituted, which must be at∣tended with the greatest serioussness and dili∣gence, This is that the Lord insists upon in all Cases; <HI>He will be enquired of,</HI> He will have <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication</HI> to be made to him in order to the Dispensation of all Covenant Blessings.</P>
<P>We may find the Doctrine confirmed by abundant Testimony of the <HI>Holy Scripture.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001888_0010_0FB9C6D34F6AAF90"/>
Among many Scriptures which might be cited I would refer particularly and peculiarly unto that▪ Jer. 29.11, 12, 13, 14. <HI>For I know the thoughts which I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an ex∣pected End; Then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart! and I will be found of you saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>For the opening of the Doctrine we are to consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath a <HI>People</HI> in the World, unto whom he hath made <HI>Promises</HI> of great Blessings. All the People in the World, the whole Posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> successively from Ge∣neration to Generation, considered in their natural Apostatic State, have <HI>forfeited</HI> the Blessing, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> separated from God, separated from his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and from Communion with God, and as Sinners, as Transgressors of the Law of God, are all justly exposed to the <HI>curse of the Law,</HI> Gal. 3.10. Notwithstanding God hath in infinite Mercy singled out a <HI>cer∣tain Number</HI> of the lost Race of <HI>Adam</HI> to inhe∣rit the <HI>Blessing.</HI> After that Man had broken the <HI>First Covenant of Works,</HI> it pleased God to make a <HI>New Covenant</HI> with a <HI>Select Number</HI> of the Children of Men, a <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and Mercy, which is established in the hand of
<PB N="6" REF="001888_0011_0FB9C6D82AB21590"/>
Jesus Christ, our Glorious <HI>Mediator,</HI> by whom all the Good of the Covenant is purchased and conveyed; According to that Covenant God doth prepare and <HI>form a People for himself in the World, to be to the praise of his Glory.</HI> Isai. 43.21. <HI>This People have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my Praise.</HI> Such a People the Lord had under the <HI>Old Testament</HI> dispen∣sation; It was the great privilege of <HI>Israel</HI> that they were set apart to be a <HI>peculiar People unto God,</HI> Exod. 19.5. Such a People the Lord hath raised up and multiplied and will yet multiply more and more, both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> under the <HI>New-Testament</HI> dispen∣sation, whom he will preserve through all Ge∣nerations unto the Worlds End. The Grace and Mercy of the <HI>New-Covenant</HI> is displayed in the visible Dispensation of it in <HI>visible Church Relation</HI> to God, in the outward Pri∣vileges of the Covenant, the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, &amp;c. But more especi∣ally in the saving Dispensation of it unto his Elect and Chosen, unto all <HI>true Believers,</HI> to his called, his justifyed and sanctifyed Ones. Such a Number the Lord hath among Men who are for a <HI>peculiar People</HI> to him. We have their Characters in the Word of Truth, where∣by they are distinguishing from all others in the World, as in, Psal. 15. They <HI>are such as walk uprightly, and work righteousness and speak
<PB N="7" REF="001888_0012_0FB9C6D9A8B60AF8"/>
the truth in their hearts.</HI> Again in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 24.3, 4. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. at the beginning; and frequent∣ly elsewhere. It is to such that all the <HI>Pro∣mises of Covenant Blessings</HI> are made and con∣firmed in Christ Jesus; However they be des∣pised by the Men of the World, yet they are the <HI>Blessed of the Lord</HI>; On them the Lord will bestow the Blessings both of the <HI>upper and nether Springs,</HI> the Blessings of Time and of Eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2. That such as live in the neglect of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication</HI> to God, have no right to the <HI>Promises</HI> of God, they can lay no claim to any <HI>Covenant Blessings.</HI> Such a number there is in the World, that have no regard to <HI>Prayer,</HI> and they are by far the greatest Number among Men. It is so universally with the Race of <HI>Adam</HI> by nature. Psal. 14.2, 3. <HI>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand and seek God, they are all gone aside.</HI> So, Rom. 3, 11. <HI>There is none that seek after God:</HI> This is the black Character of all that are <HI>Ungodly,</HI> They <HI>call not upon the Lord,</HI> Psal. 14.4. Such is their State, that they do not seek the Lord, they <HI>will not seek after God,</HI> Psal. 10.4. In that respect they have <HI>no Right</HI> to any Cove∣nant Blessing. Indeed such may be favoured according to the <HI>Sovereign Will</HI> of God in the way of his <HI>Common Providence</HI> with many tem∣poral
<PB N="8" REF="001888_0013_0FB9C6DB53B2FBE8"/>
Mercies, with the blessings of Peace and Plenty, yea of all outward <HI>Prosperity</HI>; they may be favoured with the outward visible privileges of the Covenant▪ but they can have nothing from God in a way of <HI>special Favour and Covenant Mercy</HI>; instead of a <HI>Blessing</HI> they are exposed to the <HI>Curse,</HI> the Curse of the Lord. Such is the case of all <HI>Prayerless</HI> Na∣tions, and <HI>Prayerless</HI> Families, of every <HI>Prayer∣less</HI> Society, or every individual Person in the World, that doth not <HI>seek after God.</HI> Psal. 79.6. Jer. 10.25.</P>
<P N="3">3. As it is a <HI>moral Duty</HI> incumbent upon all Men to seek the Lord by <HI>Prayer</HI>; so it is eminently the Duty of the <HI>People of God</HI> to <HI>Pray,</HI> to present their Supplications to the Lord. I say, it is the Duty of <HI>all,</HI> of all Ranks, Orders and Degrees of Men to Pray. As the Divine Existence, the Eternal Being of <HI>God</HI> is manifest by the <HI>Light of Nature</HI>: So the Light and the Law of Nature doth oblige all to <HI>Pray to God.</HI> It is an Homage due to God as the Glorious Creator and Preserver of Men, as the Great <HI>Benefactor</HI> on whom all have their Dependance. It is a part of that <HI>natural Wor∣ship</HI> due to God which is required in the <HI>First Commandment,</HI> Exod. 20.3. There are indeed no Promises from God, that he will hear the <HI>Prayers</HI> of the <HI>Ungodly</HI>; they have no <HI>Faith</HI> and therefore he can take no pleasure in their
<PB N="9" REF="001888_0014_0FB9C6E1B4ACA268"/>
<HI>Prayers.</HI> Heb. 11.6. <HI>Without faith it is im∣possible to please him.</HI> Nevertheless such is the Goodness and Mercy of God, that his Ear is open to the cries of <HI>such</HI> in the Times of Trou∣ble, Psal. 107.19. <HI>They cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, he saveth them out of their Distresses.</HI> Many such Instances there are in the way of his Providence.</P>
<P>But we are further to consider, That it is e∣minently the Duty of the <HI>People of God</HI> to <HI>Pray</HI>; It is commended unto them, not only as a part of <HI>natural Worship,</HI> but as a special part of <HI>instituted Worship</HI>; and they are under <HI>peculiar Obligations</HI> thereunto above all others in the World. This the Lord expects from the <HI>House of Israel</HI>; so the Text. As to all the Good that God hath promised to his People, He will be <HI>enquired of,</HI> he will be sought unto, that he may do it for them.</P>
<P>For the further Explication of this Head, there are divers things to be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath given a <HI>Directory for Prayer.</HI> We have in the Holy Scriptures a compleat <HI>Directory</HI> with respect to all the parts of Religious <HI>Worship</HI> and particularly of <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot give you a better Definition of Prayer than that you have in the <HI>Assemblies Catechism</HI> wherein you have been instructed, as it is drawn from the Word of God.</P>
<P>All Prayer must be directed to <HI>God,</HI> as the
<PB N="10" REF="001888_0015_0FB9C6E36CFC5B80"/>
One only Object of all Religious Worship, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.10. It is the Glory of the Lord to be the <HI>Hearer of Prayer,</HI> and his <HI>Glory he will not give to another,</HI> Psal. 65.1.2.</P>
<P>As Prayer must be made to the One True and Living <HI>God,</HI> so in the <HI>Name</HI> of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in His Name alone, as he is the One only <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and Man. 1 Tim. 2.5. in whose <HI>Name</HI> alone we are commanded and encouraged to ask. Joh. 14.13. <HI>Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that I will do.</HI> Heb. 4.14, 15, 16. <HI>Having such a Great High Priest, who is passed into the Heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, Let us come to the Throne of Grace with boldness.</HI> In that respect <HI>Prayer</HI> must be carryed on, not in our own Strength, but by the help of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God. Rom. 8.26. <HI>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The Petitions we present to God must be for things <HI>agreeable to his Will,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.14.</P>
<P>Again, Our Prayers to God must be with penitential <HI>Confessions of our Sins,</HI> Psal. 32.5. Psal 51.3, 4. with a Soul humbling sense of our <HI>Unworthiness</HI> of the least of all the Mercies we ask of God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. and so with due Ac∣knowledgment of the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, of all his benefits. Phil. 4.6. <HI>In every thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thanksgiving, Let your re∣quests be made known to God.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="001888_0016_0FB9C6E4F3B6D888"/>2. All that belong to God, have the <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> given unto them to rest upon them, by whose powerful and gracious influences they are enabled to <HI>Pray.</HI> In that respect the <HI>pre∣venting Mercy</HI> of God is displayed towards his <HI>Elect</HI> and Chosen Ones who <HI>seek him not,</HI> who have not called upon his Name. Isai. 65.1. <HI>I am sought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that sought me not.</HI> When God is about to accomplish his Eternal Purpose in the Con∣version of his Elect, he pours upon them the <HI>Spirit of Prayer,</HI> Zech. 12.10. In that respect we have a great Instance of the Grace of God in <HI>Paul</HI> upon his Conversion. Act. 9.11. <HI>Be∣hold he prayeth. Prayer</HI> is the Voice of the <HI>New Creature,</HI> of <HI>new born Babes,</HI> of all that are born of God by Regeneration; it is their pe∣culiar property to be disposed unto <HI>Prayer,</HI> and it is a sure evidence of their Relation to God as his <HI>Children,</HI> Gal. 4.6. <HI>Because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</HI> This is the Duty and peculiar Privilege of the Saints of the Lord. Psal. 32.6. <HI>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee, in a Time when thou mayst be found.</HI> There are <HI>common Gifts</HI> of the Spirit, great <HI>Gifts of Prayer</HI> bestowed upon many, who have no saving Relation to God; But all true Converts have the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God resting upon them as a <HI>Spirit of Grace and of Supplication,</HI> tho'
<PB N="12" REF="001888_0017_0FB9C6E74A9434C8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the same measure and degree. Hence it is, that none who are born of God can live without <HI>Prayer.</HI> There are indeed Times of <HI>Temptation</HI> and Restraint that pass upon the Saints of the Lord, Times wherein they are <HI>so troubled that they cannot speak,</HI> Psal. 77.4. But whatever the <HI>withdrawings</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> may be for a season from any of the Children of God, He will return to them, he will open their <HI>Hearts</HI> and open their <HI>Lips,</HI> so that they shall have Freedom and Liberty to pour out their Hearts before Him.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is the Duty of the People of God to wait on the Lord, both in the way of <HI>Or∣dinary</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary Prayer</HI>: and so it must be considered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is an <HI>Ordinary Course of Prayer</HI> to be attended by all that would approve them∣selves to God. <HI>Prayer</HI> must be the <HI>constant Exercise</HI> of the Saints and People of God; and so Prayer is to be considered both as <HI>mental</HI> and <HI>vocal. Mental Prayer</HI> consists in the in∣ward desires and breathings of the <HI>Soul</HI> after God. Psal. 25.1 <HI>Unto thee, O Lord do I lift up my Soul.</HI> With <HI>mental Prayer, vocal Prayer,</HI> Prayer with the Voice, must be joyned by those on whom God hath bestowed the Or∣gans of Speech. Psal. 5.3. <HI>My Voice shalt thou hear in the Morning, O Lord.</HI> The <HI>Voice</HI> is to be improved in <HI>Prayer</HI> in such a way and man∣ner
<PB N="13" REF="001888_0018_0FB9C6ECF5475010"/>
and to such a degree, as may be most sub∣servient to the Honour and Glory of God, our personal Relief, the Comfort and Edification of others.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Ordinary Prayer,</HI> it is further to be con∣sidered, that there are divers ways of Prayer to be attended. There is the Duty of <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> of Praying singly and apart, of perso∣nal and particular Application to God, which ought to be and will be the <HI>daily Exercise</HI> of all that belong to God. Mat. 6.6. <HI>When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and pray to thy Father which is in secret.</HI> The Children of God have many <HI>secret Cases</HI> of Prayer, many <HI>secret</HI> wants and necessities both Temporal and Spiritual, to present to him, such as the World doth not know and such as are not meet for the World to know. The <HI>Life of Religion</HI> depends much upon that way of Converse with God by <HI>Se∣cret Prayer.</HI> Again, There is the Duty of <HI>Family Prayer</HI> to be attended by Heads of <HI>Fa∣milies</HI> with those that appertain to them: There are many Obligations upon the Servants of God to attend that Duty, to present to God a <HI>Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer</HI>; and there are such <HI>Examples</HI> of Devotion left on Sacred Record, which may convince all that will consult the Oracles of God, that <HI>Family Prayer</HI> is an essential part of practical Godli∣ness; as that of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18.19. Also
<PB N="14" REF="001888_0019_0FB9C6EF5DBDA5C0"/>
see Josh. 24.25. Job. 1.5. All <HI>Heads of Fa∣milies</HI> that would approve themselves to God, must <HI>walk within their Houses with a perfect Heart,</HI> according to that great Example, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.2. There can be no Evidence of Since∣rity with such as live in the habitual Neglect of <HI>Family Prayer</HI>; however such may <HI>think themselves something, they are nothing,</HI> their <HI>Reli∣gion is vain.</HI></P>
<P>Again, With respect to <HI>Ordinary Prayer,</HI> there must be <HI>Publick Prayers</HI> made to God in Church Assembles. <HI>Acts▪</HI> 2.42. <HI>Prayer</HI> is a special part of that <HI>Publick Worship</HI> which is to be performed to God on the Sabbath; All other Ordinances must be attended with <HI>Prayer,</HI> as the Ministerial Dispensation of the <HI>Word,</HI> the Administration of the Holy <HI>Sacraments,</HI> the Seals of the <HI>Covenant</HI>; all must be accompa∣nied with Prayers and Supplications unto God.</P>
<P N="2">2 It is to be considered, that there are <HI>Ex∣traordinary Prayers</HI> to be made to God by his People; as they are liable to <HI>Extraordinary Dispensations</HI> of Providence, so they are to seek God by <HI>Extraordinary Prayer</HI> as the great means of their relief in all Cases of distress. So God is to be sought by <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> by a particular and personal Application to him; for this we have many Examples presented to us, as that of <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 32.24, 25. Hos. 12.4. <HI>He wept
<PB N="15" REF="001888_0020_0FB9C6F040D8A8D8"/>
and made Supplication</HI>; of <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 35.13. <HI>I humbled my Soul with Fasting and my Prayer re∣turned into mine own bosom</HI>; of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. 6.10. Above all we have the Example of our Lord Christ, Luk. 6.12. Luk. 22.44. <HI>Be∣ing in an agony, he prayed the more earnestly.</HI></P>
<P>And as <HI>Extraordinary Prayer</HI> is to be made in <HI>Secret</HI> singly and apart; so also by <HI>Families,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.5. There are many <HI>Family Cases</HI> which call for such Prayer.</P>
<P>Withal, there are <HI>Extraordinary Prayers</HI> to be made to God by his People in their <HI>Publick Assemblies.</HI> Times and Cases of <HI>Extraordinary dispensation</HI> call for such Prayer. For this we have plain Commands and great Examples, which stand for our instruction and imitation, as 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20. <HI>Joel</HI> 2.15, 16. <HI>Act.</HI> 12.5. Such Prayer is necessary for the preventing and removing of special Plagues and Judg∣ments, and in order to the obtaining special Mercies, positive, <HI>Extraordinary Blessings,</HI> both Temporal and Spiritual. As there are times of <HI>extraordinary distress</HI> that pass upon the Peo∣ple of God, wherein they are to Pray in an <HI>extraordinary way</HI>; so there are <HI>extraordinary Communications</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> in such times of distress, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. Thus God doth dispense to his People, as he is gracious and merciful, abundant in goodness and truth; when God doth so dispense, it is an evident
<PB N="16" REF="001888_0021_0FB9C6F21094B870"/>
<HI>Token for Good</HI>; when his People follow him with a strong current of Prayer, it is an <HI>hope∣ful Sign</HI> of some great work to be done, some great Salvation from the Lord near to be re∣vealed. The greatest Mercies are obtained in that way of Prayer; so we may find from, Jer. 31.18, 19, 20. <HI>I have heard Ephraim be∣moaning himself, turn thou me and I shall be turn∣ed</HI>; Upon that earnest cry of <HI>Ephraim</HI> we have that return from the Lord, <HI>I will surely have mercy upon him.</HI> So Jer. 50.45. <HI>In those days and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping, they shall go and seek the Lord their God, They shall ask the way to Sion, with their faces thitherward.</HI> The Answer to those Prayers we have in that which follows, ver. 18, 19, 20. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel, Behold I will punish the King of Ba∣bylon and his Land, as I have punished the King of Assyria and I will bring Israel again to his habi∣tation—In that time, saith the Lord, the ini∣quity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none, and the sins of Judah and they shall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That God hath laid himself under <HI>En∣gagements</HI> to his People who <HI>Enquire</HI> after him and Pray unto him, that he will <HI>hear their Prayers.</HI> As the Lord hath laid many <HI>Com∣mands</HI> upon his People to make their Suppli∣cations
<PB N="17" REF="001888_0022_0FB9C6F3A0E66CA0"/>
to him, so he hath annexed unto those Commands many gracious <HI>Promises</HI> that he will hear their desires. <HI>Psal.</HI> 10.17. <HI>Psal.</HI> 145.19. Such is the <HI>Condescention</HI> of God that he hath thus engaged and obliged himself to his People that call upon him, to all that call up∣on him in truth. As he will be <HI>enquired of by the House of Israel,</HI> so he hath given abundant Testimony that their Labour in the way of Prayer shall not be <HI>lost Labour.</HI> Isai. 45.19. <HI>I said not to the seed of Jacob seek ye me in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5ly, &amp; lastly. That God will <HI>certainly</HI> bestow all that Good which he hath <HI>promised</HI> to those that seek him in sincerity. That which he hath <HI>promised</HI> to bestow, he is <HI>able</HI> to bestow, and as he is <HI>faithful,</HI> he will not fail to bestow. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.21. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.23. There have been great instances of the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of God in the <HI>Answers of Prayer.</HI> 1 Kin. 8.56. <HI>There hath not failed one word of all his good promise.</HI> There is a Concurrence of all the Glorious Divine <HI>Per∣fections</HI> unto the Accomplishment of the <HI>Pro∣mises</HI> he hath made to his People. This is that we ought to remember in all the <HI>Prayers</HI> we present to God, that he is <HI>able</HI> to do and <HI>will</HI> do according to that which he hath pro∣mised. Such is the Greatness and Glory of the Lord, that he is able <HI>to do exceeding abundant∣ly above all that we can ask or think,</HI> Eph. 3.20.
<PB N="18" REF="001888_0023_0FB9C6F6675F1618"/>
This is the peculiar privilege of the sincere seekers of God, that he will fulfil all their Pe∣titions: He will <HI>withold</HI> no <HI>good from them,</HI> Psal. 84.11. Psal. 85.12. Whatsoever they ask of God according to his Will they <HI>shall re∣ceive,</HI> he <HI>will do it</HI> for them, they shall have it in the <HI>best Time,</HI> in the most proper season. There is no <HI>meritorious Vertue</HI> nor any <HI>causal Influence</HI> in the best Prayers that can be made by the most Eminent Servants of God, to pro∣cure the <HI>Blessings</HI> which he hath promised; but as Prayer is a <HI>Condition</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> as the Prayers of the Saints are the Breathings of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, and as they are presented to God by our Glorious <HI>High-Priest</HI> Jesus Christ, the righteous, our Advocate with the Father, so they prevail with God; In that respect all the Answers that are given to the Prayers of the People of God, are from the <HI>Free Grace</HI> of God in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> would afford divers profitable USES, were there Time to insist: But the Improvement I intend, is only by way of <HI>Ex∣hortation,</HI> and so with particular Application to this <HI>Precinct,</HI> unto this <HI>New Society,</HI> for whose sake and at whose desire, the present Service and Solemnity in the Worship of God is at∣tended. As you are concerned to set up a <HI>New Society</HI> for the Worship of God, according to
<PB N="19" REF="001888_0024_0FB9C6FADE25BA48"/>
the <HI>Order of the Gospel,</HI> you have set apart this Day of <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> in order <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> obtaining Divine <HI>Direction</HI> and a special di∣vine <HI>Blessing</HI> upon your Undertaking. This is that you have proposed for the Ground of your present Application to God in this so∣lemn way; See then that this Day be ob∣served to the Lord, that it be such a <HI>Fast as the Lord hath chosen,</HI> not a Day of <HI>Provocation</HI> but a Day of <HI>Atonement</HI> and Reconciliation to God, wherein you may have power to prevail with God for that you are enquiring after. It is a great thing you have to ask of God in your present Address to him. Let all your Hearts therefore be lifted up to God by the most fer∣vent Prayers and Supplications to him that he may do it for you. I would urge this Ex∣hortation upon by two or three Motives.</P>
<P>Consider, 1. That the <HI>Eyes of the Lord are upon you.</HI> You are not only exposed to the Observation of <HI>Men</HI> in that which you have undertaken, but more especially to the Obser∣vance of the Great <HI>God,</HI> the Judge of all, whose <HI>Eyes are as a Flame of Fire,</HI> Rev. 1.14. who <HI>pondereth the Paths</HI> and <HI>weigheth the Spirits</HI> of all the Children of Men. This is a Truth of great Importance for you all to meditate upon. Our Lord Christ will have all the <HI>Churches to know that He it is who searcheth the
<PB N="20" REF="001888_0025_0FB9C6FCEA4F5C20"/>
Reins▪ and the Heart,</HI> Rev. 2.23. He who <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jerusalem with Candles,</HI> Zeph. 1.12. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake a strict and thorough search into every House, into every Heart among you; He will search out your <HI>Ends</HI> in the Charge and Expence you have been at to Build this House, wherein you are now Assembled, whether your design be for <HI>God</HI> or for <HI>your selves</HI>? Whether that you have undertaken be for any <HI>carnal worldly Interest</HI> of Honour and Esteem among Men; for <HI>high Seats</HI> and high Places, or whether it be indeed for the Advancement of <HI>Religion,</HI> that the Lord may be exalted among you?</P>
<P>Consider, 2. There are <HI>Difficulties</HI> before you, and such wherein you will need Help, special Help from God, Counsels, Supports and Assistances from the Lord, that you may be able to uphold and carry on that which you have begun: This is that you ought all to be sensible of. You know how it was with the Jews upon their return from <HI>Babylon,</HI> in rebuilding the Wall and Temple of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the great opposition that Work met with: you must not think it strange, if you be tryed in like manner; you must reckon upon Trou∣ble in <HI>Temple Work</HI> and arm your selves against it, and therefore you must have your recourse to God by <HI>Prayer,</HI> both Ordinary and Extra-Ordinary Prayer; you must follow that Exam∣ple
<PB N="21" REF="001888_0026_0FB9C6FE6C69CBF8"/>
you have, Ezra 8.21. <HI>Then I proclaimed a Fast there at the River Ahava, that we might afflict our selves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for our substance.</HI> There may be Difficulties before you, with a Number among you, in <HI>outward respects,</HI> to carry on and to uphold; you may expect Obstructions to be given by <HI>Satan</HI> and his Instruments; there may be strong Temp∣tations unto <HI>Rents</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> among your selves; and there are great <HI>Mountains of Sin</HI> to be removed, to be pardoned and subdued. In all such difficulties that may be before you, you must go to God who is able to break the <HI>Gates of brass,</HI> and the <HI>Bars of iron,</HI> unto him who can make the <HI>crooked places straight</HI> and <HI>every mountain a plain,</HI> according to that in, Isai. 40.4. Zech. 4.6, 7. <HI>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts; who art thou, O great Mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the head stone with shouting, cry∣ing Grace, Grace unto it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. According as you <HI>Enquire</HI> of God, so it will <HI>fare</HI> with you. I would therefore com∣mend unto your serious consideration and improvement that Scripture, 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is with you, while you are with him: if ye seek him he will be found of you, but if ye for∣sake him, he will forsake you.</HI> If your Hearts
<PB N="22" REF="001888_0027_0FB9C70168A63448"/>
be not right with God in your present Ad∣dresses to him, if you will forsake the Lord in setting up the Interests of <HI>the World</HI> above the great Interest of <HI>Religion</HI> he will <HI>forsake</HI> you; and if you be forsaken of God, then your Condition will be most miserable. Hos. 9.12. <HI>Wo to them when I depart from them.</HI> Whatever you may enjoy of <HI>outward Prosperity</HI> or of <HI>outward Ordinances,</HI> all will be <HI>penal</HI> and judicial; you can have nothing of a <HI>special Blessing</HI> with them. On the other hand, if your Hearts be set aright for God, if you be sincerely devoted to his Service to follow him and to cleave to him in all those ways which he hath instituted and prescribed; He will be <HI>your God</HI> and acknowledge you to be <HI>His People,</HI> according to that great Promise, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.39. He will set up his <HI>Tabernacle</HI> among you, he will bless you with all the Blessings of his <HI>Sanctuary</HI>; and to all those Spiritual Blessings he hath promised to bestow, he will add the outward Blessings of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> in your Dwellings, of <HI>Health</HI> in your Habitations, He will <HI>bless all the Work and Labour of your Hands.</HI> Whatever <HI>Afflictions</HI> you may meet with in the way of your Obedience to God, all shall be <HI>Sanctifyed</HI> to you, the Lord will be for a sure and strong support to you in all times of Trouble, he will <HI>never leave you nor forsake you,</HI> he will <HI>perfect all that doth con∣cern</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="001888_0028_0FB9C702E55FBBD8"/>
you, even because his <HI>Mercy endureth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>For your <HI>Direction</HI> in this great Concern.</P>
<P N="1">1. You must consult <HI>the Law and the Testi∣mony</HI> in all that you have to ask of God. Thi∣ther you are directed, Isai. 8.20. Mat. 28.20. <HI>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded.</HI> This is that which must be attended in all that doth refer to your estab∣lishment in the <HI>Order of the Gospel</HI>; you must <HI>Enquire of the Lord from his Word</HI> how it may be done so as may be unto his Honour and Glory, to the progress of the work of Con∣version, unto your Edification and Consolation and so to the Salvation of your Souls. Tho' your Establishment in <HI>Church State</HI> under the full Administration of Gospel Ordinances, be not directly the present Subject of your <HI>En∣quiry</HI>; this is that which ought to be and must be enquired after <HI>in due time</HI>; and there∣fore it may not be unseasonable at <HI>this time</HI> to warn you of the Danger of following the <HI>Counsels of your own hearts</HI>: if there be a re∣solve for your <HI>own Counsels</HI> the Lord will re∣ject your <HI>Prayers.</HI> Psal. 66.18. <HI>If I regard Iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</HI> What can be expected but that he will answer you according to your Idols? Ezek. 14.3, 4· <HI>These men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their

face, should I be enquired after all by them? I the Lord will answer him that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eth according to the multitude of his Idols.</HI> If you would be Blessed with a Sound Sanctified <HI>Ministry,</HI> if you ex∣pect a <HI>Pastor</HI> from God <HI>according to his own Heart,</HI> Jer. 3.14. If you would obtain that great Gift of our Glorified Saviour Jesus Christ, as the fruit of his Ascension and Mediation, you must consult those Rules, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. where you have the qualifications of the <HI>Gospel Ministry.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let your Prayers and Supplications be attended with deep <HI>Humiliation for Sin</HI>; for all your past Transgressions, and all those Sins which still remain among you unrepented of, whether open or secret Sins, First Table Sins or Second Table Sins: This the Lord always insists upon with his People; in order to the obtaining those great Mercies he hath pro∣mised to bestow upon them. <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.40, 41, 42. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 7.14. There must be <HI>Convicti∣on</HI> of Sin, ingenuous <HI>Confession</HI> of Sin, <HI>Contrition</HI> of heart for Sin; deep penitent <HI>Reflections</HI> up∣on contempt of the Glorious <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ, profanation of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> neglect of <HI>Family Order</HI> and <HI>Family Worship, Contentions, Intempe∣rance, Lasciviousness, Fraud, Deceit, Unrighteous∣ness</HI> and all other Evils you may find upon Self-Examination; whatever there hath been of <HI>precipitancy</HI> or <HI>preposterousness,</HI> of rashness or sud∣denness
<PB N="25" REF="001888_0030_0FB9C70956399340"/>
in any of your Motions and Manage∣ments with respect to your Publick Concerns, must be recollected and repented of, if you expect a Blessing from the Lord.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let your <HI>Enquiries</HI> and Askings of the Lord be for <HI>Spiritual Blessings,</HI> as the <HI>main and principal things.</HI> Such is the Goodness of God, that he is tender of his People in all that doth refer to their <HI>Temporal Welfare:</HI> he is so as he stands ingaged in those indearing Relations of a <HI>Master,</HI> of a <HI>Father,</HI> of an <HI>Husband</HI>: in this respect he hath promised to bestow upon them Blessings in their <HI>Houses,</HI> in their <HI>Fields,</HI> the Blessings of <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> of Protection, Provision of all <HI>outward Supplies,</HI> whatsoever may be needful for them: These things God allows you to ask of him in <HI>Subordination</HI> and <HI>Subservency</HI> to the highest and greatest things, Mat. 6.11. <HI>Give us this day our daily Bread.</HI> But above all that doth concern your temporal state, you are to ask for the saving <HI>Blessings of the New Covenant,</HI> for <HI>Spiritual Blessings in Hea∣venly things</HI> in Christ, the <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin, the <HI>Favour</HI> of God. Hos. 4.2, 3. <HI>Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously.</HI> Psal. 4.6. <HI>Lord lift up the light of thy Countenance upon us.</HI> Con∣verting and Sanctifying Grace for yourselves and your Offspring. Jer. 31.18. <HI>Turn thou me and I shall be turned.</HI> Psal. 90.16, 17. <HI>Let thy work appear unto thy Servants, and thy glory unto
<PB N="26" REF="001888_0031_0FB9C70B476BE700"/>
their Children. Let the Beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our Hands.</HI> These are things of the greatest Va∣lue, which ought to have the highest esteem in your Hearts and are to be sought after with the greatest earnestness.</P>
<P N="4">4. Your <HI>Enquiries</HI> of God and Supplications unto God must be with <HI>Union,</HI> with a due ac∣cord and agreement among your selves. As you must come to an <HI>Agreement</HI> with God, so also <HI>one with another.</HI> Amos 3.3. <HI>Can two walk together, except they be agreed? Union</HI> with one another in the Lord is necessary in all the parts of Religious Worship and particularly in <HI>Prayer.</HI> This is the condition Christ hath laid before you in order to the acceptance of your Prayers with God. Mat. 18.19. <HI>I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on Earth, as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father, which is in Heaven.</HI> There are solemn Commands laid upon all Christians to <HI>seek peace</HI> and to <HI>pursue it,</HI> to <HI>walk in love one towards another</HI>; to labour for the most per∣fect Union that is attainable both in <HI>Judg∣ment</HI> and <HI>Affection:</HI> Such Commands are ite∣rated and reiterated, they are earnestly incul∣cated, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.1, 2. and fre∣quently elsewhere. We find it among the great <HI>Peomises</HI> God hath made to his People, that he will give them <HI>one heart to fear him and
<PB N="27" REF="001888_0032_0FB9C70CB04869A0"/>
to serve him,</HI> Ezek. 11.19. It will be your Strength, your Crown and Glory, to be <HI>of one Heart,</HI> to live in <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> one to∣wards onother. I beseech you therefore by the Mercies of God that you lay aside all <HI>Grudges</HI> one against another, that you <HI>study to be quiet. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory,</HI> Gal. 5.26. Phil 2.4, 5. Let there be no <HI>strivings</HI> among you for Places of Honour and Dignity in <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State,</HI> in Civil or Military respects. Let not this House which you have Erected for the Name of the Lord, be a <HI>Meribah,</HI> a place of strife; not a <HI>Beth-Aven</HI> but a <HI>Bethel</HI> and so a <HI>House of Prayer,</HI> and a <HI>House of Peace,</HI> that the <HI>God of Peace &amp; Love</HI> may be with you, that here the Lord may <HI>Command the Blessing, even Life for ever more,</HI> Psal. 133.5. You must ask in <HI>Faith,</HI> by a firm reliance upon God, relatively considered, in and through our Glorious <HI>Mediator,</HI> Jesus Christ. This is indispensably necessary. It is the great thing the Lord requires in all your Prayers. Jam. 1.6. <HI>Let him ask in Faith</HI>: and eminently in the Prayers you present to him at this day. 2 Chron. 20.20. <HI>Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established.</HI> You have that for your Encouragement, Mat. 21.22. <HI>All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing ye shall receive.</HI> There must be a de∣pendance of <HI>Faith</HI> upon the Wisdom of God,
<PB N="28" REF="001888_0033_0FB9C70E2634AB90"/>
the Power of God, the Goodness and Mercy, the Truth and Faithfulness of God, upon all his Glorious Attributes, upon the Merits of Christ by whom all Covenant Blessings are purchased, upon his Mediation, by the vertue whereof all the Good of the Promise is actu∣ally dispensed and applyed. As to all you may be called to do or to suffer in that which you have undertaken, your <HI>Dependance</HI> must be upon the Lord. There must be Faith for the <HI>Pardon of Sin</HI> and Faith for the <HI>Subduing all your Iniquities,</HI> Faith to strengthen you a∣gainst all <HI>Temptations,</HI> to <HI>direct</HI> and to <HI>uphold</HI> you in all the duty incumbent in your respective Places and Capacities. You who are yet Strangers to the work of <HI>Faith</HI> must plead hard with God that you may be enabled to <HI>believe.</HI> Mar. 9.24. that you may obtain the great <HI>Gift of Faith,</HI> Eph. 2.3. You that have obtained the <HI>precious Faith of God's Elect,</HI> must stir up your Souls to a lively exercise of <HI>Faith.</HI> I hope there is a Number among you who <HI>through Grace have believed.</HI> Let such be ex∣cited to improve your Interest in God with the greatest Vigour, that you may encounter all the <HI>Difficulties</HI> which are before you unto perfect Victory, that the Lord may own the Work which you have begun, that it may be carryed on with Power, that His Hands may finish it.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="29" REF="001888_0034_0FB9C70FA54628F8"/>6. Let your Supplications to God, be fol∣lowed with <HI>Reformation</HI>: This it that the Lord calls for and expects from you. Jer. 7.3. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, amend your ways and your doings and I will cause you to dwell in this place.</HI> Consider therefore the need, the great need there is of <HI>Reforma∣tion.</HI> See that there be a <HI>Reformation</HI> with respect to the Publick Worship of God, Pub∣lick Ordinances, a more tender regard to the Sanctifying of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> a greater Zeal for the <HI>House of God,</HI> that as you are now fa∣voured with greater Conveniencies than be∣fore to attend upon Publick Worship, so your Zeal may flourish in waiting upon the Lord. As to <HI>Family Reformation,</HI> Let there not be one <HI>Prayerless Family</HI> found among you. You that are Heads of Families, Parents and Masters, see to it, that <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> Reading the Scriptures, Catechizing, Conference about the things of God be upheld in your Houses. Let <HI>Parents</HI> remember that solemn Charge which is laid upon them, Deut. 6.6, 7. <HI>The words that I command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently to thy Children.</HI> Let the <HI>Young</HI> Generation of this Society be perswaded to lay a <HI>sure Foundation</HI> of sound Conversion in the Morning of their day, Eccl. 12.1. For that end be subject to <HI>Fami∣ly Rule</HI> and Government, avoid all unseaso∣nable

Night Walks as they are the <HI>Works of Darkness</HI>; hearken to the faithful Counsels and Pious Instructions of <HI>Parents,</HI> give your selves to <HI>Prayer,</HI> labour so to walk that you may be counted to the Lord for a Generation. Further as to Reformation respecting <HI>Immora∣lities</HI> against the Second Table, besides other Evils which might be mentioned, I would re∣fer particularly to that of <HI>Intemperance,</HI> the excessive and prodigious expence upon Strong Drink, above all that of RUM, I say the scandalous and horrible abuse of RUM, which threatens Ruine unto this Land and to this Place, a Ruine to all our dearest Interests both Civil and Religious. If there be any such Houses among you, as I fear there are, that Vend that Strong Drink contrary to the Law of God and the Wholesome Law of the Pro∣vince, let such of you who are vested with Civil Power, and stand obliged under the Oath of God see that such grievous Profanations be suppressed, least that Iniquity, <HI>The Abuse of Rum,</HI> be our Ruine.</P>
<P N="7">7. Finally. You must wait on the Lord with <HI>quiet Expectation</HI> for the performance of all the Great things he hath promised to do for his People. Thus we are to wait for a more full Accomplishment of this Promise in our Text, as it refers to <HI>Israel,</HI> to the Conversion of the <HI>Jews</HI>; and so far as the Promise of God in
<PB N="31" REF="001888_0036_0FB9C71798D8A820"/>
this Chapter, together with many other Pro∣mises in the Holy Prophets refer to the Enlarge∣ment of the Kingdom of Christ among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> we must <HI>wait</HI> for the performance of them. Tho' there have been many and great Disappointments as to <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Seasons,</HI> with respect to the Destruction of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> the Conversion of <HI>Israel,</HI> the Gathering of the Gen∣tile Nations; all these things shall be done in the <HI>appointed Time,</HI> the Testimony of the Lord is sure, the <HI>Vision will speak at the end and not lie</HI>; Times of Accomplishment are in the Lord's Hand, and as he <HI>is a God of Judgment, blessed are all they that wait for him,</HI> Isai. 30.18.</P>
<P>As to that which refers to this <HI>New Society,</HI> who are designed for the Worship and Service of God, you must continue <HI>instant in Prayer</HI> to God, he will yet be enquired of, that you may be established in the <HI>Order of the Gospel,</HI> that you may be built up to be an <HI>Habitation of God through the Spirit:</HI> you must avoid haste and hurries; <HI>He that believeth shall not make haste,</HI> Isai. 28.16. Wait on the Lord and keep his way, that it may be well with you. Be perswaded to suffer this Word of Exhortation which is given you from the Lord by your Aged Pastor, who hath served you in the Gospel now full <HI>Fifty Four Years,</HI> and I hope by the Grace of God in some measure of Sincerity, tho' attended with much Weakness, great Infirmi∣ties
<PB N="32" REF="001888_0037_0FB9C719860F0298"/>
and manifold Temptations. Let these Counsels of the Lord be acceptable to you, labour to have them engraven upon the <HI>Tables</HI> of your hearts; and see that all your deport∣ments and improvements be such, that the Lord may take pleasure in your Prosperity accor∣ding to the Riches of his Grace in Christ Jesus, that true Religion, <HI>pure and undefiled Religion</HI> in the power, beauty and glory of it may live with you and with your Children after you unto all Posterity. In order thereunto I shall conclude with that solemn Prayer of the Apostle on your behalf, Heb. 13.20, 21. <HI>Now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that Great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</HI> Amen.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Psalm describes (as is supposed) the disposition and behaviour of the Godly among the Jews in <HI>Babylon,</HI> when their Seventy Years Capti∣vity was near its Expiration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Their Condition</HI> in that Captiv'd state was extreamly distressed and calamitous, and is in this Psalm spread before God in Prayer;
<PB N="2" REF="001888_0039_0FB9C71C717BF800"/>
therefore is the Psalm Entituled, <HI>A Prayer of the Afflicted when overwhelm'd</HI> (with sorrow) <HI>he poureth out <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Complaint before the Lord.</HI> Their days in that Captivity were <HI>consumed like smoke,</HI> ver. 3. in which is nothing solid, neither strength, beauty nor delight. Their <HI>Bones were burnt as an Hearth</HI>; The continual Grief on their Spirits dryed up <HI>their Bones,</HI> Prov. 17.22. So that it's said of the Church in Baby∣lon, <HI>Shall these dry Bones live?</HI> Ezek. 37.2, 3, 4. They were like <HI>withered grass pulled up by the Roots,</HI> which therefore must needs dye, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. The Church was then like a <HI>Pelican of the Wil∣derness,</HI> ver. 6. forsaken of all Friends, and loving solitude and solitariness, <HI>like a Sparrow alone on an house top,</HI> ver. 7. When her Con∣dition call'd most for pity, her Enemies added more Affliction to her by their <HI>Reproaches,</HI> ver. 8. The Church to her own apprehension was in a decaying, wasting, declining state, <HI>like the shade of the Sun</HI> that is going down, which va∣ries every moment 'till it end in total darkness, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. In this Prison of <HI>Babylon</HI> the Church lay groaning, like a Son of Death, like a Per∣son Sentenced to Death, of whose Life was no hope as to an eye of sense or reason.</P>
<P>Thus was the Jewish Church <HI>weaken'd</HI> when they were in the heighth of their Strength and Splendor, in the midst of their Prosperity, <HI>ver.</HI> 21, 24. <HI>Cast down</HI> and depressed from the height

of Dignity, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. deprived of their Country, of Church Privileges and Ordinances, and sent among barbarous Enemies; to learn the worth of such Blessings by the want of them: and were cast down with such violence as to break them in pieces as the <HI>breaking of a Pot∣ters Vessel,</HI> Isai. 30.14. The Church was then like a Widow and Orphans, <HI>destitute</HI> of any Head, Parent or Guide to take care of them, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. Their case was desperate as to Se∣cond Causes, being destitute of any help from Man.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their disposition</HI> and behaviour in that afflicted state.</P>
<P N="1">1. They were <HI>sensible of God's Hand</HI> inflicting and of <HI>their own Sins</HI> procuring these Trou∣bles, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. It is <HI>because of thy indignation and Wrath.</HI> Hypocrites bear Afflictions with im∣patience, murmuring against God as if he were unjust or cruel. Godly Men are sen∣sible that God doth <HI>not willingly grieve nor afflict</HI> the Children of Men, that God acts not rash∣ly but for just causes and holy ends; that their Sins kindle God's Anger against them, and bring Punishments upon them. This grief for their Sins works in them, <HI>Repentance unto Salvation. Thou hast cast me down,</HI> ver. 10. <HI>thou hast weakned my strength and shortned my days,</HI> ver. 23. They take notice of an Hand of <HI>God</HI> in all Calamities; that there is <HI>no Evil in the City, but God hath done it.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="001888_0041_0FB9C724DF816248"/>2. The <HI>Support</HI> of their Pious Souls under this distress was from and by the lively Exer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of <HI>Faith in Prayer</HI>; that God would in his due time Restore them from that state of Captivity, to the enjoyment of State-Privi∣leges and Church-Privileges in their own Land. They stir up themselves to <HI>believe</HI> that God would <HI>hear their Prayers,</HI> tho' he had delayed to give Returns to their Prayers hi∣therto, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. yet he would no longer hide his Face or turn away his Ear from them; He would no longer neglect them but speedi∣ly make it appear that he heard them. They fix the eye of their Faith on God's <HI>Eternity and Immutability,</HI> ver. 12. not meerly considered <HI>essentially</HI> but <HI>relatively,</HI> as it is revealed in the Word of <HI>Promise</HI> that he will take care of his Church in the midst of greatest Calamities, which Promise cannot fail, as the Nature of God is immutable. There is no Generation past or to come but therein God remembers to be faithful to his Promise of taking care of his Church. No changes or injuries of Time can stop the course of God's <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to his own People. <HI>God will arise,</HI> ver. 13. He will make it appear that he is not asleep, that he is not a meer Spectator of things done on Earth: but is <HI>the Keeper of Israel who neither slumbers nor sleeps</HI>; he is always intent upon the taking care of the safety and welfare of his

Church, to restore Peace to them and to take Vengeance on their Enemies. <HI>God will have mercy upon Zion</HI>; that is, the Church, which is called the Daughter of <HI>Sion</HI>; by <HI>pardoning the Sins</HI> of his People upon their Repentance, <HI>accepting them into Favour</HI> with God, bringing them back to their own Land, and restoring their Civil Polity, and especially the Worship of God and the Privileges of his House, unto them; and that in the appointed Time, the <HI>Messiah</HI> should come in the Flesh, who should restore all things. For <HI>the set time to favour Sion is come,</HI> ver. 13. the time prefixt by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> chap. 29.10. Their <HI>Seventy Years</HI> of Captivity was now almost expired. Also God's People <HI>took pleasure in the stones and favoured the dust of Sion,</HI> ver. 14. They had excited in them an inflamed love to their Country, their Religion and the instituted Worship of God; their want of them had taught them highly to prize and value them as their precious things, more precious then Dust of Gold, or the richest Pearls: and they believed that out of the <HI>Stones and Dust of Sion,</HI> tho' now confused, should spring forth, by Divine Power, a New Temple, and that there should be a Glorious Resurrection and Re∣stauration of Religion; for they believed that God himself would <HI>appear gloriously,</HI> and make it evident that it is his <HI>own Work</HI> peculiarly,
<PB N="6" REF="001888_0043_0FB9C727D1AEA450"/>
to <HI>build up Sion,</HI> ver. 17. to gather the Jews from their dispersions and to set up their civil Po∣lity, with the Temple and Divine Worship: which Work of God should be famous, like the making of dry and dead Bones to live, or like the raising of dead Bodies out of their Graves. When this work is accomplished, it will be apparent that God has done it and not Man; that <HI>God himself hath looked down from the heighth of his Sanctuary in Heaven</HI> and be∣held the Earth; that he hath set at Liberty the <HI>Prisoners appointed to Death,</HI> ver. 20. that they may proclaim God's Name in Sion and his Praise in Jerusalem, in their own Land. This Work of God shall be a new Creation Work, the making <HI>of a new Heavens and a new Earth,</HI> ver. 25. creating and <HI>forming a people to Praise the Lord,</HI> ver. 18. That Text in Isai. 43.21. <HI>This People have I formed for my self, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shew forth my praise,</HI> points at this very time of the Restoration of the Church after the <HI>Baby∣lonian</HI> Captivity.</P>
<P>And this should be a Work done for the good of succeeding and future Generations, for their <HI>Children</HI> should be established in the Enjoyment of these Church Privileges, <HI>before God</HI> or most certainly, <HI>ver.</HI> 28.</P>
<P>Again, This should be such a Glorious Work of God as should be famous among the very Heathen Nations round about them, and
<PB N="7" REF="001888_0044_0FB9C72C5D1509B0"/>
the <HI>Kings of the Earth</HI> shall hear of it to the impressing some fear and dread of God upon them, <HI>ver.</HI> 15. Yea the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that were Strangers to <HI>Israel</HI> and Enemies to them, by the Beauty and Comeliness of the Lord put upon <HI>Israel,</HI> should be moved to joyn with them in Praising God, <HI>ver.</HI> 22. and the Cal∣ling of the Gentiles into the Church is sup∣posed to be predicted in this Psalm.</P>
<P>During the Seventy Years Captivity of the <HI>Jews</HI> there was little of Religion, little of the Remembrance of God's Name and Worship left in the World; but Pious Souls did com∣fort themselves, that the time drew near when not only the Temple should be restored, but the Church should be enlarged by the calling of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> This Prophecy was especially fulfilled in the times of the <HI>Messiah</HI>; to <HI>him shall the Gathering of the Nations be,</HI> Gen. 49.10.</P>

<P>The Building up of Sion, or the Revival and Progress of Religion, is a work accomplished by God himself, in answer to the Prayers of his People, when they are deeply humbled for their Sins, and sensible that they are destitute of all Help for the promoting of this work, except the help of God alone.</P>

<P><PB N="8" REF="001888_0045_0FB9C72EA6BF1140"/>To Explain the Words of the Text and Doctrine,</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider, That <HI>Sion</HI> was a Mountain in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> on the Top whereof was a Tower, and was called the <HI>City of David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5.7, 9. <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.6. And some extend the Name so far as to take in Mount <HI>Moriah</HI>; on which Moun∣tain the <HI>Temple</HI> was built. The <HI>Church of the Jews</HI> was called <HI>Sion,</HI> because that was the Place where they assembled. Afterwards this Title of <HI>Sion</HI> was given to the Church both of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> because they agree in one and the same Faith and Religion, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.22.</P>
<P>In several respects the Church might be re∣sembled unto <HI>Sion</HI>; namely, As <HI>Sion</HI> was a Fort of the <HI>Jebusites,</HI> who were Strangers to God and the true Religion, so the Church consists of such who are <HI>Strangers to God</HI> before their Conversion; such as were Spiritually <HI>halt</HI> and <HI>blind</HI> by nature. <HI>Mich.</HI> 4.6, 7. in al∣lusion to 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5.6, 7. And as those <HI>Jebu∣sites</HI> were subdued by <HI>David,</HI> and their Fort turned to a Religious use: so Sinners are subdued by Christ (the Antitype of <HI>David,</HI>) and built up into an <HI>Holy Temple to the Lord,</HI> Col. 2.7. 2 Cor. 6.16. Again, as <HI>David</HI> made Mount <HI>Sion</HI> the Place of his Royal Re∣sidence: so the Church and every true Mem∣ber of it is the <HI>Sion</HI> that God dwells in by his
<PB N="9" REF="001888_0046_0FB9C731304E4988"/>
<HI>Spirit,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.19. and by <HI>Faith</HI> wrought in the heart, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Sion</HI> was called the <HI>City of God,</HI> the <HI>Mountain of His Holiness,</HI> Psal. 48.1, 2, 8. &amp; 50.2. because his Oracles and Ordi∣nances, which are the signs and tokens of his Presence, were upheld therein: and was there∣fore styled the Place which God had chosen and desired to dwell in; so the <HI>Church</HI> is the Society which God loves above all the World, and he gives Christ to none but the Church; in this <HI>Sion</HI> (his Church) he lays the <HI>chief cor∣ner stone Elect and precious,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.6. and there∣in are preserved the Divine Oracles and Or∣dinances of Worship. Also the height of <HI>Sion</HI> may be conceived to point at the elevation of the affection of the Saints to things above. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.1. and their <HI>Conversation in Heaven</HI> while they are upon Earth, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.21. And the strength and firmness of <HI>Sion</HI> may put us in mind of the stability and unmoveableness of the Church, <HI>Psal.</HI> 126.1. <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.18. But what is said may suffice to shew the agreea∣bleness and suitableness of the Title of <HI>Sion,</HI> to be given unto the <HI>Church.</HI> It's plain that in Scripture the Church under the Gospel is called <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> Heb. 12.22. and <HI>Jerusalem, Gal.</HI> 4.26. whereof the <HI>Mount Sion</HI> in the Earthly <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was a Type, <HI>Psal.</HI> 14.7. and 15.20 and there the <HI>Gospel</HI> was first pro∣claimed without that terror with which the
<PB N="10" REF="001888_0047_0FB9C732E9149230"/>
<HI>Law</HI> was delivered on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> Isai. 2.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider, The <HI>Church</HI> of God is either <HI>Invisible</HI> or <HI>Visible,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) The <HI>Invisible Church</HI> of the Elect. True Believers are <HI>God's House, built by Christ,</HI> Heb. 3.3. 2 Cor. 6.16. The <HI>Temple of the Living God.</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9. <HI>Ye are God's Building.</HI> The Building up of the <HI>Elect</HI> to be a <HI>Temple</HI> for God is the peculiar secret work of God's Spirit, even from the first hewing and polishing of them to be Stones fit and meet for the Build∣ing, unto the perfecting of the whole Work of Grace in them.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The <HI>Visible Church.</HI> This is visible <HI>Zion.</HI> The building up of visible <HI>Zion</HI> is by the En∣largement of the <HI>visible Church,</HI> by addition of Nations and Plantations thereunto, which were before ungospellized, and by the Propaga∣tion of the visible profession of Religion unto the Posterity of succeeding Generations of the Church. The Planting of the Gospel where it was not Planted before; and the upholding and preserving of Religion where it was before Planted; the enlargement and growth of Churches and the <HI>Increase of them</HI> in Number may be called a <HI>Building up of Sion. Building</HI> up is opposite to <HI>pulling down</HI>; It notes the prosperous and flourishing state of the Church which is opposite to the decaying state thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001888_0048_0FB9C734AF123B60"/>These Considerations being premised, let us Explain the parts of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>PROP. I. The <HI>Building up of Sion</HI> is <HI>God's peculiar Work,</HI> in the carrying on of which work the Glory of God doth eminently ap∣pear, and is displayed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Invisible work of <HI>Grace</HI> in the Souls of the Elect is the <HI>peculiar Work of God</HI> by his Holy Spirit; in the beginning and progress of this work of Grace, the Lord doth <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> unto each of their Souls. The cal∣ling and gathering of them out of the World (which <HI>lyes in wickedness</HI>) unto himself by an holy and effectual calling unto their real and thorough <HI>Conversion,</HI> is a glorious <HI>Creation-work</HI> of God: so is also the <HI>preserving</HI> of Grace a∣live in them and maintaining it in exercise and causing it to grow in strength and to higher degrees of Perfection, notwithstanding all the force and fraud used by Satan and the car∣nal World to weaken and extinguish Grace in them, were it possible. The Beauty and Glo∣ry of the <HI>Grace, Wisdom, Power,</HI> and of the other Attributes of God shining forth in the begin∣ning, upholding, increasing and perfecting the work of Grace in the Souls of his Elect shall at the last day be <HI>admired in all those that be∣lieve,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.10. Indeed God condescends to make use of the Preaching of the Word, and of the outward means of Grace, in car∣rying
<PB N="12" REF="001888_0049_0FB9C73A66EB1E98"/>
on this Work; but until Men do hear the voice of God speaking to their hearts as well as the voice of Men speaking to their ears they will not be Converted; until they feel the power of <HI>God's Spirit,</HI> which goes beyond any humane power in the efficacy of it, their <HI>hard Hearts</HI> will not be broken for and from Sin, nor their <HI>blind Minds</HI> be savingly enligh∣tened in the knowledge of Christ so as to be∣lieve in him for Salvation, nor will their <HI>love to Sin</HI> be turned to an hatred thereof, nor will they accept of <HI>Christ</HI> and submit to him in all his Offices and Ordinances and upon his own Terms on which he is offered in the Gospl.</P>
<P>And after Men are Converted the same Divine creating power doth <HI>appear in its Glory</HI> to preserve Grace alive in their Souls. We need the <HI>fresh Anointings</HI> of the Spirit to give new supplies of strength and nourishment un∣to Faith and every other Grace in us: we need to have our <HI>Souls watered</HI> every moment from above to preserve Grace in a thriving and flourishing state in our Souls: we need the help of God to recover us from decays in Grace, to quicken and revive Grace in us, to strengthen us with might in <HI>the inner man by the Glorious Power</HI> of his Holy Spi∣rit, to enable us to get a victory over <HI>Sin</HI> dwelling in us, and over <HI>Satan</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> without us, which are the Enemies that fight
<PB N="13" REF="001888_0050_0FB9C73D5C733FB8"/>
against our Souls, and to enable us to conflict with and conquer that <HI>last Enemy Death,</HI> that we may enter into Heaven, triumphing over our Spiritual Enemies, after the end of our present Militant estate on Earth.</P>
<P>This internal <HI>Building up of Zion</HI> in the hearts of the Elect, is that peculiar work of God which he chiefly aims at and intends to see accomplished in this World; and there∣fore is <HI>the World</HI> itself preserved in its being 'till all the Elect of God are born into an Ex∣istence in the World and New-born unto Christ by their Regeneration: All other the works of <HI>Divine Providence</HI> are put in subser∣viency unto this great work of the calling home of the Elect unto Christ, even as <HI>many as were fore-ordained unto Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Building up of Sion Visibly,</HI> or the upholding and enlarging the Visible Church is the <HI>peculiar work</HI> of God, in effecting where∣of he doth <HI>appear in his Glory.</HI> For, God is wont to carry on his <HI>invisible work</HI> in the Hearts of his Elect, by the <HI>outward means</HI> of Grace, by the Word Preached and by Ordi∣nances administred; therefore for the Elects sake God will uphold and preserve a <HI>Visible Sion</HI> or Church state upon Earth, until all his Elect are gathered in unto Christ.</P>
<P>And God has promised that Christ shall <HI>see his Seed,</HI> that is, shall have a <HI>Visible Seed</HI> upon
<PB N="14" REF="001888_0051_0FB9C73E25C86CA0"/>
Earth in all Generations, <HI>Isai.</HI> 53.9. Also it is for the declarative or manifestative <HI>Glory</HI> of God in the World, that a <HI>Visible Church</HI> should be preserved therein. The forming or plan∣ting of <HI>Churches,</HI> the new forming or giving forth new Editions of the Church, the Refor∣mations of it in the several ages of the World; the defending of it against its Enemies, are such displays of the Wisdom, Power, Faith∣fulness and Grace of God, yea of all his At∣tributes, that it may be justly said, that the Lord doth <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> here on Earth, when this good work is going forward.</P>
<P>God the <HI>Father</HI> hath therefore in his Eter∣nal Counsels resolved that Christ shall have a <HI>Visible Kingdom</HI> upon Earth, and the contrary <HI>works of the Devil</HI> shall be destroyed; by means whereof the Lord Jesus Christ shall be glori∣fied upon Earth. <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.22, 27, 30, 31.</P>
<P>Take some Instances of the <HI>Glorious Appea∣rances</HI> of God in building up his Visible Church and Kingdom upon Earth.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) There was a <HI>Visible Church</HI> erected or formed in <HI>Adam's</HI> Family, after his Fall: The foundation on which it was built, was the <HI>promised Seed,</HI> the <HI>Messiah</HI> that <HI>Seed of the Woman who was to break the Serpents head,</HI> who was to come into the World to <HI>destroy the works of the Devil.</HI> In that Church, the Worship of God by <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> was upheld, and there was <HI>Church
<PB N="15" REF="001888_0052_0FB9C73FA6D1BE80"/>
Discipline</HI> exercised therein, as when <HI>Cain</HI> was rejected from the enjoyment of the presence of God in his House and Ordinances. In <HI>A∣dam's Family</HI> was formed the first <HI>Visible Gospel Church</HI> that ever was in the World.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Lord did <HI>appear in His Glory</HI> to build up his Church Visible in the days of <HI>Noah:</HI> with him was the Covenant of Grace renewed; by him who was a <HI>Preacher of Righ∣teousness</HI> was Christ preached; and by the <HI>Ark</HI> a Type of Christ, Men were taught that in Christ only Mankind could be saved from the deluge of Eternal Wrath: also <HI>Laws</HI> of Wor∣ship were given to <HI>Noah</HI>; and the apostatized World of Men, were swept out of the World by that universal Flood, that they might no longer obstruct the thriving and flourishing of the true Religion upon Earth, seeing they were become incorrigible in their Sins. Thus we see that God was content to part with a <HI>whole World</HI> of sinful Men, rather than <HI>Religion</HI> should not be upheld in the World; rather than Sinners by their numerousness and mul∣titude should obstruct the work of <HI>Reformation</HI> and the Progress of <HI>Religion</HI> upon Earth.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Another remarkable Period, wherein the Lord did appear in his Glory for the <HI>Build∣ing of Sion,</HI> was at the time of the <HI>Dispersion</HI> of Mankind by the confusion of their Languages at <HI>Babel.</HI> For hereby vast number of <HI>Hypo∣crites</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001888_0053_0FB9C7425CE9EE88"/>
were separated from the true Church and purged out from fellowship with the Church; while <HI>Religion</HI> (and probably the <HI>Original Language</HI> also) was preserved in the House of <HI>Shem,</HI> the Father of <HI>Heber,</HI> Gen. 10.21. who would not (as is conceived) joyn with the rest in building the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>And this <HI>Confusion of Languages</HI> proved a Bar to hinder the rest of the World from hold∣ing Communion with the true Church, nor was this Bar or <HI>Partition Wall</HI> remov'd 'till <HI>Christ made Peace by the Blood of the Cross</HI> and obtained the <HI>Gift of Tongues</HI> in order to the publishing of the Gospel among all Nations, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Another remarkable Period, wherein God appeared in his Glory for the <HI>Building up of Sion,</HI> was when God renewed his Co∣venant with <HI>Abraham.</HI> For, tho' during those Ten Generations from the Confusion of Lan∣guages at <HI>Babel</HI> until the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Church enjoyed a Ministry by excellent Tea∣chers, for <HI>Noah</HI> lived <HI>Three Hundred &amp; Forty Years</HI> after the Flood, and served in the Church as a great Prophet, as also <HI>Shem</HI> was preserved in life 'till <HI>Abrahams</HI> time, and <HI>Melchizedeck,</HI> who was a <HI>Priest</HI> to offer Sacrifices and to ex∣plain the meaning of them, as well as a <HI>King</HI> to do Justice. Yet <HI>Religion</HI> was before the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Abraham</HI> almost extinct in the World,
<PB N="17" REF="001888_0054_0FB9C748CB51A0F8"/>
being miserably decayed and corrupted: The Lord therefore thought it high time to <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> for the preservation and restoration of it: by calling <HI>Abraham</HI> to separate himself even from his Fathers House and his Native Land, and by revealing himself unto <HI>Abraham</HI> and Covenanting with him to be a <HI>God to him and to his Seed</HI>; and made him the <HI>Father</HI> in respect of this Covenant renewed with him, not only of his own natural Seed but of his <HI>adopted Seed in all Nations,</HI> namely, of all that should have the like Faith in the <HI>Messiah</HI> which was wrought in <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 12.1. and he became <HI>Heir of the World</HI> or of the Church in the World, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11, 12, 13. and thus in <HI>Abrahams Family</HI> God preserved a <HI>Seed to serve him,</HI> distinguisht from the rest of the Apostate World.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Another Period of time wherein there was a very <HI>Glorious Appearance</HI> of God for the Building up of the Church, was in the time of <HI>Moses.</HI> For <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> were become very ignorant, and being kept like Slaves and Drudges under their Taskmasters, laboured under woful disadvantages for the upholding of Religion and the Worship of God. The Lord, rather than <HI>Religion</HI> should be wholly lost upon Earth, was pleased by remarkable works of Providence to revive it out of the ashes. He raised up <HI>Moses,</HI> reveal'd himself
<PB N="18" REF="001888_0055_0FB9C74A30780138"/>
to him from Heaven, taught <HI>Israel</HI> the Ten Commandments from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> appointed Ordinances of Worship and the Rules of a <HI>Church State</HI> as well as of a well ordered Civil Polity: which Laws and Ordinances Cere∣monial and Judicial were of force for the space of <HI>Fifteen Hundred Years,</HI> namely 'till the coming of Christ.</P>
<P>Yet in this interval between <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> the Church fell under woful Degene∣racies and Apostacy into Vice and Idolatry; so that God was provoked to send them into <HI>Babylon</HI> for Seventy Years. But at the end of that term it pleased God to proceed to a <HI>New Forming</HI> of his Church that he might have a People set apart <HI>for himself to shew forth his Praise</HI> visibly on Earth, <HI>Isai.</HI> 43.21. and the <HI>Temple</HI> was rebuilt and the Ordinances of Divine Worship again set up: This our Text seems to refer unto.</P>
<P>But at length the Jews fell to idolizing the very Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> expecting <HI>Justification</HI> by the literal observance of it; which was a great dishonour to Christ the true <HI>Mediator,</HI> that the <HI>Shadow</HI> should be preferr'd before the <HI>Substance</HI>; yet thus they did, for under an Opinion of being steady <HI>Disciples of Moses,</HI> they refused to become <HI>Disciples of Christ</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Hence at this time and age of the World, there was as much need of <HI>making all things</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001888_0056_0FB9C74BD92A4A90"/>
new, or of new forming the Church as there was at the time of <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood, when the <HI>whole World had corrupted their ways</HI>; and as there was in any other of the aforementioned Periods.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) Hereupon, <HI>Christ</HI> himself, the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> appeared in the World, as the greatest of Prophets and the chief Builder to carry on this work of <HI>Building up the Church</HI> and to ren∣der the state of it still more glorious. He so ordered, that the <HI>Temple</HI> and its Worship, which the Jews idolized, should be destroyed, that the <HI>Law of Ceremonies</HI> should be abrogated; and as being <HI>Lord of his House</HI> did appoint the Laws of it, and instituted the Ordinances of <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lords-Supper</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> need∣ful to be observed in the Church in these days of the Gospel. He pulled down the <HI>Wall of Partition</HI> betwixt the <HI>Jews</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> enlarged the Curtains of the <HI>Tabernacle of David</HI> (Isai. 54.2. Amos 9.11.) takes the <HI>Gentiles</HI> within the Covenant and within the pale of the <HI>Church,</HI> engrafting them into that <HI>Vine</HI> from which the Jews for their impeniten∣cy and for their rejecting of Christ, were cut off. He bestowed <HI>miraculous Gifts</HI> on the A∣postles to furnish them for the carrying on of this work, the propagation of <HI>Religion</HI> in the World, and there were remarkable effusions of the Spirit in the days of the Apostles, by
<PB N="20" REF="001888_0057_0FB9C74D253B0D38"/>
which God did <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> for the <HI>build∣ing up of Sion.</HI></P>
<P>These are some instances of the glorious Appearances of God in the World for the carrying on his work, which deserve to be enlarged upon by a better Hand. But these Hints may be of present use unto us. Also much might be added concerning the won∣derful appearance of God in carrying on the work of <HI>Reformation</HI> from <HI>Popery</HI> in latter Ages; how the Grace, Faithfulness, Power and Wisdom of God have been displayed in many signal Steps thereof.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us proceed to consider, that the Lord doth also <HI>glorify</HI> his Name in building up his Church, in the more <HI>ordinary Course</HI> and Methods of his Providence, for the preserving of <HI>Religion</HI> where it is set up and propogating of it to succeeding Generations. Take some instances of God's Wisdom and Grace appear∣ing therein.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) God hath taken care and made provi∣sion that the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Christian Parents</HI> should be esteemed to belong to his <HI>Church</HI> and Visi∣ble Kingdom; and hath commanded their Parents to bring them up for God and doth set the Mark of <HI>Baptism</HI> upon them to distin∣guish them from the unbelieving World, and they are brought under Obligations Sealed at their <HI>Baptism,</HI> to be the Covenant People of
<PB N="21" REF="001888_0058_0FB9C751C816E858"/>
God. If God had not made this Provision, there would have been great <HI>Chasms</HI> and <HI>Va∣cancies</HI> in the dispensation of the <HI>Visible Cove∣nant</HI>; for then the Children of Believers would not have been Children of the <HI>Church,</HI> nor under the care of the Church any more than <HI>Pagans</HI> and Infidels, and being left to them∣selves to chuse their Religion, would be ex∣posed to sore Temptations to Apostacy, which would tend to dissolve the Church soon after it is planted.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Christ as Head of the Church, doth in every Age bestow <HI>Ministerial Gifts</HI> upon some to qualify them to teach and lead his Church upon Earth, namely <HI>Wisdom, Know∣lege,</HI> and <HI>Utterance,</HI> to know how to <HI>speak a Word in Season</HI> for the instruction and edifica∣tion of the Church, <HI>Isai.</HI> 50.4. These Gifts are to qualify some to be <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Levites</HI> to the Lord in Gospel times, <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.21. Called <HI>Prophecyings,</HI> 1 Thes. 5.20. 1 Cor. 14.22.</P>
<P>These <HI>Ministerial Gifts</HI> are ordinarily con∣veyed to and conferred on Persons since the Apostles days, by a <HI>Ministerial Education</HI> in the <HI>Schools of the Prophets.</HI> As there is the <HI>Seed of the Church</HI> in Visible Professors Educated from their Infancy under the Christian care of their Parents and under the watch of the Church; so there is the <HI>Seed of the Prophets</HI> preserved in the Sons of the Prophets whom
<PB N="22" REF="001888_0059_0FB9C753502D1918"/>
Christ raises up for his peculiar Service, and the Spirit of Prophecy (or of Ministerial Gifts) and Christs Word shall <HI>not depart out of their Mouths for ever,</HI> Isai. 59.20. But Christ will take care that there shall be a <HI>Succession</HI> of Per∣sons thus educated and qualifyed for Publick Service in his Churches in all succeeding A∣ges, 'till the end of the World. This was the way God took for the continuance of the <HI>Spi∣rit of Prophets</HI> in the Old Testament; for tho' there was a more immediate effusion of the Spirit on the <HI>Seventy Elders,</HI> Numb 11.25. yet it was afterwards continued in the <HI>School of the Prophets</HI> wherein some ancient experien∣ced Prophet was a <HI>Spiritual Father</HI> and the <HI>Scholars</HI> were called his <HI>Sons: Samuel, Elijah, Elisha</HI> were <HI>Fathers</HI> in that School, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.20. 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> 2.5, 7, 15. <HI>Amos</HI> 7.14. Yea, af∣ter this manner Christ himself laid the Foun∣dation of the <HI>New Testament Church,</HI> he took twelve Men into his School and was Tutor and Master unto them himself. Joh. 13.13. <HI>Ye call me Master and ye say well, for so I am.</HI> Agreeably did the <HI>Apostles</HI> practice; they associated to themselves some <HI>Assistants</HI> in the Ministry who were under the Apostles In∣structions as their <HI>Sons</HI>; as <HI>Timothy, Titus, So∣thens, Gaius▪ M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cus, Aristarchus,</HI> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 2.1. and <HI>Paul</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Timothy</HI> in, 2 Tim. 2.2. to <HI>commit the things which he had heard of him unto
<PB N="23" REF="001888_0060_0FB9C754B29510F0"/>
faithful Men, who should be able to teach others also.</HI> The conferring of Ministeral Gifts and Grace is a Token of Christ's special Love to his Churches and of his <HI>Presence</HI> with them; One of the <HI>Witnesses</HI> to evidence that Christ is come in the Flesh is, <HI>The Spirit on Earth,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.8. namely, the Gifts of the <HI>Spirit</HI> for the building up of the Church. This <HI>Spirit of Prophecy,</HI> or Gifts of the Spirit to the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Churches, is the <HI>Testimony of Jesus,</HI> Rev. 19.10. namely, that <HI>Jesus Christ is Head of the Church</HI> and still lives in Heaven and takes care of it. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7. Happy are they who hear what this <HI>Spirit saith to the Churches.</HI> By this <HI>Spirit</HI> is <HI>Life</HI> preserved in the Church in evil times. When this <HI>Salt</HI> hath not <HI>lost its savour</HI> then it goes well with the Churches.</P>
<P>PROP. II. The <HI>Building up of Sion,</HI> tho' it be <HI>God's peculiar work</HI> yet he carries it on in the World, as a <HI>Return &amp; Answer to the Prayers of his People,</HI> who are deeply humbled for their Sins and sensible that they can do nothing of themselves for the promoting this Work, to effect, without God's Help, Blessing and Pre∣sence with them.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>internal Temple-work</HI> carryed on in the hearts of God's Elect, it cannot be pre∣served or promoted by <HI>outward Means</HI> alone, without the powerful influences and operati∣ons
<PB N="24" REF="001888_0061_0FB9C7619E614860"/>
of God by his <HI>Spirit. Paul may plant, A∣pollo may water,</HI> but <HI>God only giveth the increase,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>Extraordinary Revivals of Reli∣gion</HI> and New Formations or Recoveries of the Church after great Apostacies, in several Ages of the Church: they have been accom∣plished by remarkable Dispensations of Pro∣vidence and more than ordinary effusions of the <HI>Spirit</HI> whereby it is evident <HI>God</HI> hath effected them and not <HI>Men</HI>; tho' God has been pleased to make use of <HI>Men</HI> in that work. And the Lord hath done this work in <HI>Answer to the Prayers</HI> of his People when they were deeply humbled before him and destitute of help in themselves; like <HI>Israel</HI> when the Sea was before them and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> behind them, and Mountains on each side of them, having no way left for their Relief but to <HI>look up∣wards</HI> towards Heaven, by Faith and Peniten∣tial Prayers. Tho' the carnal World despise the Church, as a <HI>feeble Folk,</HI> as weakness itself, yet the <HI>Strong God</HI> appears to be on their side, to take their part, and they are <HI>Strong in the Lord and in the Power of his Might.</HI> God indites the <HI>Prayers</HI> of his People for them by his Spirit, so that they Pray for such things as are agreeable to God's Will and tend to his Glory; He fills their hearts with holy desires after the <HI>Revival of Religion</HI> and Enlarge∣ment
<PB N="25" REF="001888_0062_0FB9C763C1436510"/>
of the Church; and having accepted their <HI>Persons</HI> for Christ's sake, doth also accept of their <HI>Prayers</HI> and works wonderfully in answer to their Prayers, even <HI>beyond what they could ask or think</HI>; and they will not cease Praying, 'till they have obtained of God the Destruction of <HI>Antichrist</HI> and of the Kingdom of Satan. God's People will <HI>give him no rest day or night</HI> 'till he have Mercy upon <HI>Sion</HI> and build up the Walls of his <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and until the Enemies of the Church are trodden down un∣der her feet.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to the more <HI>ordinary way</HI> of the <HI>Conti∣nuance</HI> and <HI>Propagation</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> from one Generation to another successively, all the steps taken therein prove not successful unless a <HI>Blessing</HI> attends them in answer to the <HI>Prayers</HI> of God's People. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) We are to plead earnestly with God in <HI>Prayer,</HI> that he would <HI>pour out his Spirit on the Seed and his blessing on the Offspring</HI> of the Church. <HI>Isai.</HI> 44.3. and polish them to be fit <HI>Stones</HI> to lay in the building of <HI>Sion,</HI> the Church; that so Religion may be continued and <HI>estab∣lished</HI> among the Children and <HI>Seed</HI> of God's Servants, <HI>Psal.</HI> 102.28. that the Education of the <HI>Lambs</HI> of the Flocks of Christ under Pa∣rental and Ministerial Instructions may be attended with God's Blessing, for their Con∣version; and that they may not be left to
<PB N="26" REF="001888_0063_0FB9C76525806338"/>
forsake the God of their Fathers, as they grow up; nor to neglect to set up <HI>Family Worship</HI> in their Houses, nor to <HI>forsake the Publick Assem∣blies</HI> of God's People, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.25.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) We are by <HI>Prayer</HI> to obtain from Hea∣ven this great Blessing of God, that the Churches may be supplied successively with <HI>Officers</HI> qualifyed with those <HI>Gifts of the Spirit</HI> as well as with Grace, whereby they may be capable to become <HI>Pastors after God's own heart,</HI> to feed and lead the Flocks of Christ with <HI>Knowlege and Understanding</HI>; that God would be pleased plentifully to bestow Mini∣sterial Abilities on such as he improves in his Churches. Even <HI>Paul</HI> himself writes in, 1 Thes. 5.25. <HI>Brethren, pray for us.</HI> and 2 Thes. 3.1.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) We ought in a way of earnest <HI>Prayer</HI> to endeavour the <HI>Planting of the Gospel</HI> in the <HI>dark Corners</HI> of our Land: and that God would <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> for the succeeding our En∣deavours for that end. It's God's work to make a People willing to embrace the Gospel; to open their <HI>Eyes</HI> to see that <HI>where Vision fail∣eth</HI> a People are like to <HI>perish,</HI> and to open their <HI>hearts</HI> to bid welcome to such as bring to them the <HI>glad Tydings of Salvation.</HI> When the Gospel in the Ministry and Ordinances there∣of is offer'd to a People, its a better and greater Offer, than if we could proffer them all the Riches of the <HI>Indies</HI>; yet such an offer will be
<PB N="27" REF="001888_0064_0FB9C766A4E46D70"/>
slighted unless the Lord enlighten a People to see the worth and value of it. Let us not be discouraged, but <HI>persevere in Prayer</HI> for this great Blessing to be bestowed by God on those whose <HI>Souls</HI> are precious and immortal as well as <HI>ours</HI>; and whose Salvation we should de∣sire and endeavour as well as the Salvation of our own Souls.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why will God have this Work, the Building up of Sion carryed on in Answer to the Prayers of a penitent and humble People?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Because those who are brought into a penitent <HI>humble prayerful frame,</HI> are in some measure <HI>prepared</HI> to give unto the Lord the <HI>Glory due unto his Name</HI> for the progress of this work of Religion. They see their own <HI>sinfulness</HI> and vileness, that they are unworthy of such a favour from God; they see their own <HI>inability</HI> and insufficiency to do any thing that shall subserve to the building up of <HI>Sion</HI>; therefore when any thing of that nature and tendency is effected, they will say, <HI>Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to thy Name be the Glory.</HI> The less of <HI>Man</HI> is seen, the more of <HI>God</HI> ap∣pears in this Work. We shall not duly ac∣knowledge the glorious <HI>Efficiency</HI> of God in carrying on this Work, 'till we see our own <HI>No∣thingness.</HI> We are indeed to acknowledge the
<PB N="28" REF="001888_0065_0FB9C76F115B7B40"/>
<HI>Instruments</HI> whom God makes use of (as they did, Luk 5.7. <HI>He hath loved our Nation and built us a Synagogue</HI>) but in such a way as not to derogate from the Glory of <HI>God,</HI> but to bless God for enabling such to be instrumen∣tal in promoving his Work. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. The more <HI>humble, penitent and prayerful</HI> we are, before such favours are bestowed up∣on us, the more ground there is to hope that our spiritual and saving <HI>good</HI> will be furthered by them. An impeninent and unhumbled heart is not fit to improve a Mercy to his own spiritual good and advantage.</P>
<P N="3">3. When God moves the <HI>Wheels of Provi∣dence</HI> by his <HI>Spirit in the Wheels</HI> (Ezek. 1.12.) He is wont at such a time to move the <HI>Wheels of Grace</HI> in the hearts of his People, filling them with longing desires after the accom∣plishment of that Work which God hath in hand, for his Glory. The <HI>building up of Sion</HI> externally is attended with the <HI>building up of Grace</HI> in the hearts of true Believers: for at such a time there will be a fresh and renewed exercise of <HI>Love</HI> to God, <HI>Fear</HI> of God, <HI>Faith</HI> and Trust in God: yea every <HI>Grace</HI> of God's Spirit will take its turn to be in Exercise at such a time.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="29" REF="001888_0066_0FB9C77152FE4630"/>4. That <HI>Mercy</HI> hath a <HI>double sweetness</HI> in it, unto a Soul truly Pious, which comes from Heaven in answer to <HI>penitential and fervent Prayer</HI>: when a Soul can say, <HI>This is that very Mercy which I wrestled with God for; and he hath heard my Prayer and Supplication.</HI> How sweet is that Mercy!</P>
<P N="5">5. Because, We <HI>continually need</HI> the directing, supporting and comforting <HI>Presence</HI> of God with us and his co-operating <HI>Providence,</HI> both as to the beginning and as to the progress of any Work of God which we engage in.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) We need God to <HI>direct</HI> us by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> in every step we take in his Service: that we may do his work <HI>after the right Order,</HI> so as may please him: for <HI>God is not the Au∣thor of Confusion but of Peace,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.33. and he made a breach upon <HI>Uzzah</HI> when he acted indiscreetly and inconsiderately in God's Work and not <HI>after the due Order,</HI> 1 Chron. 15.13. Its matter of Joy to Good Men to <HI>behold the Order of the Saints</HI> in their proceedings in any good Work. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.5. and that there may not be the <HI>noise of Hammers,</HI> &amp;c. in the building of their <HI>Temple,</HI> 1 Kin. 6.7. that all clamour and disturbances may be avoided, and that peace and calmness may attend us in our Un∣dertakings; we had need to pray earnestly to God to restrain and mortify our prid
<PB N="30" REF="001888_0067_0FB9C772AD50D868"/>
passions, envy, self-seeking, and all other <HI>cor∣rupt Inclinations</HI> that will be springing up in us when we are about God's Work.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) We need the <HI>assisting</HI> and <HI>comforting</HI> presence of God with us, when we set about any good Work; should therefore pray to him to <HI>strengthen us with might in the inner Man,</HI> Eph. 3.16. and that we <HI>may not faint and be weary in well doing</HI>▪ Gal. 6.9. that God would encourage our hearts and strengthen our hands in his work; and that his Work may not be marred and spoyled and prove abortive by passing through our defiled hands.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) We have need to pray for the <HI>co-ope∣rating Providence</HI> and efficiency of God with our endeavours to build up <HI>Sion:</HI> that he would cause a <HI>Coincidence</HI> of all things to the accomplishing his Work; that he would pre∣vent, or give us Wisdom and Grace to over∣come, the multitude of <HI>Obstructions</HI> which Sa∣tan from time to time endeavours to lay in the way, to stop the progress of God's Work: and that it may appear that <HI>God himself doth work with us,</HI> for us and by us.—And that God would be pleased to supply our wants and afford us such means and such a measure of outward <HI>Wealth</HI> as he sees is needful for the carrying on his Work and supporting of his Worship.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="31" REF="001888_0068_0FB9C77424C738E0"/>6. Because we are always beholden or obliged to the <HI>Free Grace of God</HI> to <HI>accept</HI> of our Persons and to accept of those mean Ser∣vices which we do for his Name and Glory. Such <HI>Acceptance</HI> we can't expect unless we be <HI>Prayerful and Penitent</HI>: and how sad a thing will it be, if all we do should be rejected of God, and our Persons rejected also, for want of true Faith and Repentance in us, <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.11, —15. Let us then offer up our selves and our poor Services unto God in and by Christ, that they may prove an <HI>acceptable offering, of a sweet smelling savour unto God.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. God builds up <HI>Sion</HI> in answer to Prayer conjoyned with Humiliation and Repentance, because he will put that honour and respect upon the duty of <HI>Prayer</HI> with Fasting and Hu∣miliation of Soul for our Sins; which is a Duty of his <HI>Appointment</HI> and Institution. Therefore God will so order things in his Pro∣vidence, that Christians shall find by Experi∣ence, that all Good Works which they en∣gage in do succeed the better when carryed on by <HI>Prayer</HI>; and that the neglect of that duty and the neglect of exercising those Gra∣ces required unto the acceptable performance of that Duty is one cause why <HI>Religion</HI> thrives and flourishes no more, and makes no greater progress in the World. When a <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="001888_0069_0FB9C77A4908A710"/>
and Supplication is poured out upon a People, then God's Work prospers and goes forward; When <HI>Moses hands</HI> were lifted up, then <HI>Israel</HI> prevailed. When our <HI>hands hang down</HI> (i. e. when we omit and neglect <HI>Prayer</HI>) then the work of Christ in our hands goes on heavily and slowly.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE.</HEAD>
<P>Hence we infer, that we are this Day in the way of our <HI>duty,</HI> while we set apart this Day to humble our Souls before God and to Sup∣plicate at the Throne of Grace for Mercy, in reference to the present state of the Work of God in this Place.</P>
<P>This <HI>New Building</HI> wherein we are now met for the exercise of Sacred Worship, may serve to put us in mind of the <HI>Building up of Sion,</HI> spoken of in our Text, which is the pe∣culiar work which God is concern'd for in the this World. And the design of Erecting <HI>this House,</HI> being for the more convenient Assem∣bling of God's People who inhabit in this part of your Town, with an aim at the preserva∣tion and propagation of Religion to your Posterity; It is therefore very needful that Prayer and Humiliation should be attended, in your progress in this work.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="001888_0070_0FB9C77C653CDA28"/>But having been too large and tedious al∣ready, I shall close the Discourse with a few Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us <HI>search our Hearts,</HI> our <HI>Houses</HI> and our <HI>Conversations</HI> that we may find out the <HI>Sins</HI> which we should this day mourn for and con∣fess and beg Pardon of; which if they are impenitently persisted in will obstruct God's presence with us and his blessing upon us. No∣thing can hurt us but <HI>Sin</HI>; Sin provokes the Lord to withdraw himself from particular Persons, who indulge themselves therein. <HI>Fa∣mily Sins</HI> unreformed provoke the Lord to hide himself from such Families; and the pre∣vailing <HI>Sins of the Place</HI> and People where we live, bring down the Judgments of Heaven upon the Publick Society and procure the Frowns and Rebukes of God upon us: and bring a blast on Mens endeavours, tho' the work be materially Good which they set a∣bout. Let each of us labour to find out his own iniquity; and lament it before the Lord. Is there any Sin, which we have not yet re∣pented of and reformed? Let us do it <HI>now,</HI> for in this work we are engaging in, the God with whom we have to do is an <HI>Holy God,</HI> of <HI>purer Eyes than to behold iniquity</HI> with any ap∣probation thereof.</P>
<P>Let us lament the <HI>pride</HI> of our hearts, the <HI>vanity</HI> and <HI>carnality</HI> of our minds, our confor∣mity
<PB N="34" REF="001888_0071_0FB9C77DE4C81B70"/>
to the sinful courses of the <HI>carnal World,</HI> the <HI>coldness</HI> and lukewarmness of our Affecti∣ons towards God and Religion, our back∣wardness and indisposedness to that which is Good, our want of <HI>Zeal</HI> against Vice, and that we have mourned and grieved so little for the Sins prevailing in the Time and Place where we have lived, and that we have neg∣lected to use our utmost influence and interest for the reforming of them. Let us mourn for our <HI>Barrenness</HI> under the means of Grace, and that so many of us are not yet laid as polished <HI>Stones in God's Building,</HI> namely <HI>The Church.</HI> That we have lived in Omission of <HI>Family Prayer</HI> and of the Holy <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Divine Institution: that we have been too negligent in giving good Counsel, Exhortations and Reproofs unto others, especially to our own Children and Inferiours. And whatever o∣ther Sin our Consciences cannot but charge us with, upon serious Self-Examination; Let us mourn for it before the Lord this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us betake our selves by <HI>Faith</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Lamb of God who taketh away the Sins of the World.</HI> Wash in the <HI>Fountain</HI> of the Blood of Christ which is <HI>o∣pened</HI> unto us in the Gospel. Put forth the renewed lively actings of <HI>Faith in prayer,</HI> to lay hold on a Crucifyed Saviour for the ob∣taining
<PB N="35" REF="001888_0072_0FB9C783CED46EB8"/>
the Remission of all our Sins, that we may be cleansed from the Guilt and Filth of them; that through Christ our <HI>Peace</HI> may be renewed with God, all matter of Controversy between God and us removed; and that we may ob∣tain well-grounded hopes, that God will <HI>not hide</HI> himself from us or withdraw his gracious presence from us. We are cloath'd with <HI>fil∣thy Garments</HI> (as <HI>Joshua</HI> was after the return from <HI>Babylon</HI>) and <HI>Satan is ready to resist us</HI>; objecting that such contemptible Persons as we are, are utterly unfit to be improved in God's Service. Let us look up to God by Faith that these our <HI>filthy Garments</HI> may be taken from us, and that the <HI>Robe of Christ's Righteous∣ness</HI> may be put upon us. <HI>Zech.</HI> 3.3, 4. and that we may be cleansed from the guilt and filth and power of our Sins, and may be pre∣pared by the Sanctifying virtue of the Holy Spirit <HI>unto every good work,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.21.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us fix and exercise our <HI>Faith,</HI> upon the gracious <HI>Promises</HI> and Declarations of God's Will in his Word, referring to the <HI>Building up of Sion,</HI> the preservation and pro∣pogation of Religion. Labour firmly to be∣lieve that God will be faithful to his <HI>Promises</HI>; He will <HI>endure for ever and his Remembrance to all Generations,</HI> ver. 12. He will <HI>yet arise and have mercy upon Sion.</HI> He is the <HI>same God</HI> still,
<PB N="36" REF="001888_0073_0FB9C785684EB5D8"/>
<HI>ver.</HI> 27. He hath the <HI>same care</HI> of his Church which he ever had. He is ready to hear us when we cry to him and call upon him for the revival of Religion, and in order there∣unto for the pouring forth of his Spirit on his People, and on their Offspring, and for all things needful for the advancement of his Kingdom. He hath stored up Mercy in his Covenant for the <HI>Generations to come and for the People that are yet to be created,</HI> ver. 18. for the <HI>Children of his Servants and for their Seed,</HI> ver. 28.</P>
<P>It is not in vain to Supplicate to the Lord for these Favours; that the rising Generation and those who succeed them may be privi∣ledged with a standing and being planted within the pale of the Visible Church and un∣der the initiatory Seal of <HI>Baptism</HI>; that their Parents may be moved from the Love they bear to their Children, to bring them near unto God and to offer and dedicate them un∣to the Lord in their <HI>Baptism</HI>; that they may enjoy the priviledge of <HI>Parental Christian Nur∣ture</HI> in the knowlege and fear of God, and an Education under an Orthodox and Learned and Pious Ministry from their Youth until their riper Years, whereby they may be form∣ed to be a Generation whom the Lord shall take pleasure in; of whom the Lord shall say, <HI>This People have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my Praise.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="001888_0074_0FB9C786F6C773E8"/>Let us this day lift up our Hearts unto God to fit us for and be with us in those Trans∣actions that are preparatory to the Forming a <HI>Particular Church</HI> in this part of your Town; that there may be the renewed exercise of Faith and Repentance in such as shall be lead∣ing in that work of Erecting a <HI>Visible Three of Christ</HI> on Earth, and in all who shall become constituent parts of such a Christian Society, that they may become an <HI>Holy Temple to the Lord</HI>; and that they may be accepted of God in such a Work.</P>
<P>Let us Pray that the <HI>Multiplication of Churches</HI> in this Town (as well as in others) may not prove occasions of <HI>Distance,</HI> Differences or A∣nimosities among Christian Friends, Neigh∣bours or Brethren; but that all the Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Land, may <HI>walk together in Love,</HI> as so many particular Companies in One Great Army under One and the same Head and Lord, that on account of their Communion and amicable▪ Walking together they may be terrible as an Army with Banners.</P>
<P>Let us Pray that your Aged, Faithful and Reverend <HI>Pastor,</HI> whose Labours and Conduct hitherto hath been very successful for the up∣holding and furtherance of Christ's Kingdom
<PB N="38" REF="001888_0075_0FB9C788A586FAB8"/>
in this Town, and whose Life and Abilities God hath in mercy continued; so that by his Pious Counsel and Fervent Prayers you have been refreshed and directed and blessed in this Day of your first Assembling in your new Building; may still have occasion to re∣joyce in beholding not only the <HI>Form</HI> but the <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> upheld in all parts of this Town, and that the finishing parts of his Time may be filled up with delight and com∣fort, which he may take in the sweet savour of the Graces of God's Spirit maintain'd in a flourishing state in the Hearts and Lives of God's People over whom he hath for many Years been an Overseer.</P>
<P>Let us Pray, That the Person on whom your Eyes are placed, to fix in this <HI>Candlestick</HI> (if it please God to give you leave to bring your designs to an Accomplishment) may be made a singular Blessing in his Station and Generation, for the upholding and propoga∣ting of Religion, Peace and Order.</P>
<P>Let us close with that Petition, <HI>Let thy work, O Lord, appear to thy Servants and thy Glo∣ry to our Offspring. Let the Beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and the work of our hands establish thou it,</HI> Psal. 90.17.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="39" REF="001888_0076_0FB9C78F730CAA20"/>4. Let not our Prayers be limited to our <HI>selves</HI>; but on such Occasions, when <HI>Sion</HI> is building up in any particular place, our Thoughts, Desires and Petitions should be en∣larged and extended to <HI>other parts</HI> of the World. That there may be a further Accom∣plishment of that prediction, in ver. 15. <HI>The Heathen shall fear the Name of the Lord and all Kings of the Earth thy Glory.</HI> And in ver. 22. <HI>The People shall be gathered together and the king∣doms to serve the Lord. Antichrist</HI> shall be de∣stroyed, the <HI>Jews</HI> Converted and the fulness of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall come in unto Christ: and that Prophecy shall yet have a further Ac∣complishment, Mal. 1.10. <HI>From the rising of the Sun even to the going down of the same, my Name shall be Great among the Gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering: for my Name shall be Great among the Heathen, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI></P>
