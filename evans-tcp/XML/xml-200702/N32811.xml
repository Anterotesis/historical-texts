<P>And it shall come to pass after that I have plucked them out, I will return, and have Compassion on them, and will bring them again, every Man to his Heritage, and every Man to his Land.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WAS it then reserved for a Stranger to your Persons, and your Altars, to address you on this happy Restoration of your public Worship? This solemn Re establishment of your Religious Assemblies? Was it to have been the good Fortune of One, to whom you were un∣known, but by your Sufferings, to be among the first of the Ministers of God, to bring the Comfort and Con∣solation of his Word to an afflicted and persecuted People? To tell them, that he has not forgotten <HI>his loving Kindnessess of old,</HI>—that however he seemed re∣solved to <HI>chasten them in his Displeasure; to cast off his Altar and abhor his Sanctuary; to cause the solemn Feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten, and, in the Indignation of his Wrath, to reject the King and the Priest</HI>—that how∣ever he suffers <HI>their City to be left desolate and broken down, and every House shut up, so that no Man may come in:</HI> yet that he will <HI>return again in his Mercy, in his appointed Time, to have Compassion upon his afflicted, to comfort his oppressed,</HI> and to <HI>bring them again every Man to his Heritage, and every Man to his Land; to say to the Prisoners, Go forth, and to them that are in Darkness, Shew yourselves; to restore their Princes as at the First, and their Counsellors as at the Beginning, and again to give them Priests according to his Heart?</HI> Let it be my first Care to bless his holy Name for having per∣mitted
<PB N="6" REF="043111_0003_101CCC3585FA4DD0"/>
me to join with your returning Clergy in the Discharge of this pleasing Office. They also will add their Praises to mine.—You, my Brethren, will not be wanting in Gratitude and Thankfulness to the God of your Redemption, and the united Voice of <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>People</HI> will be—<HI>It is good that a Man should both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</HI>▪ His Ways are inscrutable, but his Goodness certain and without Bounds.</P>
<P>WHO that was Witness of the cruel and disastrous Deed of the Night before last, could promise himself, that you should be assembled this Day in the House of God, to praise him for your wonderful Deliverance? Who could have hoped that this Temple would remain a Monument of the returning Favour of Heaven, amidst the Horror of the Ruins through which you must have passed to approach it? Which of you could have said to himself, that he should see these Doors opened once more for the Reception of the Faithful, <HI>tho' as yet but as the Shaking of an Olive Tree, and the Gleaning Grapes when the Vintage is done?</HI> Or hear these Walls, so long silent and unfrequented, filled again with the Praises of him, to whose Name you had raised them? Is not this the Lord's Doing? Is not this our God for <HI>whom we have waited? We have waited for him, he hath saved us, and we will be glad and rejoice in his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>SUFFER me, however, to check for a Moment, the Ferment which these different Sensations of Joy and Grief, so rapidly succeeding each other within these few Days past, must naturally have raised in your Breasts. When the Heart, long oppressed, and closed in Affliction, is suddenly opened to the Impressions of Joy, only to be overwhelmed as suddenly with an ad∣ditional Weight of Sorrow and Dismay, the Tumult within must be too violent to leave much Room for calm and useful Reflections. It shall therefore be my Business
<PB N="7" REF="043111_0004_101CCC03DCC82A00"/>
to endeavour to suggest such Thoughts as appear suitable to this extraordinory Occasion, and to regu∣late your present Affections, in a Manner that best becomes the Disciples of Christ.—This has never been, and I am confident never will be, the Pulpit of Contention or Strife. No <HI>Prophets, prophesying Lies in the Name of the Lord who sent them not,</HI> shall ever turn it into a Stage for Sedition. The Words of Truth and Life will never be perverted here in promoting Violence and Bloodshed, under Pretence of consulting the Interests of the God of Peace; to cause the Reli∣gion of the lowly, mild and meek Jesus to speak the Language of Ambition, Slaughter and Revenge; or to consecrate and deliver out in his Name, the Sword that is to be plunged by his Followers into each others Breasts. Thanks be to the Lord, <HI>we have not so learned Christ.</HI> We will neither abuse his Mercy, and long Forbearance ourselves, by thus daring to prostitute his awful Name; nor shall we presume to deal out the Bolts of his Vengeance against others, whom his Justice may arraign as guilty of such Profanation.—I there∣fore repeat it again, our only Business will be to suggest such Reflections as should engage the Minds of Christ∣ians on this Occasion, to exhort you to turn your Thoughts to yourselves; to consider the Redemption that has been wrought in your Favour, and the Dispo∣sitions with which you should receive these Instances of the Divine Mercies.</P>
<P>THE first Consideration that arises from the Subject, is the grateful Sense you should entertain of the Good∣ness of God.</P>
<P>THE immediate Impressions of Gratitude for present Benefits are strong, lively and affecting. We feel them with Warmth; we express them with Rapture—But it happens too frequently that we enjoy them with In∣difference, and by Degrees totally forget the gracious Hand that conferred them. While we are in Danger,
<PB N="8" REF="043111_0005_101CCC370E09F2C8"/>
and Fear is upon us, we <HI>call upon the Name of the Lord</HI>: Our Sins and Transgressions affect us in their Conse∣quences; and our future Obedience, Fidelity, and Gratitude, are fervently pledged in the Hopes of imme∣diate Protection and Relief. But when the first Sense of our Delivery is past, when our Enemies are sup∣pressed, and the Danger removed, we are too apt to forget the Resolutions we formed in the Hour of Di∣stress; our former Passions and evil Habits too fre∣quently return with our former Security. The God of our Salvation is forgotten, and repayed with Ingrati∣tude, Neglect and Disobedience.</P>
<P>THE Conduct of Individuals is, generally speaking, the Conduct of the Community. Ingratitude for Fa∣vours, tho' a Disgrace to our Nature, is but too com∣mon in the private Intercourses of Life; nor are In∣stances less frequent of the ungrateful Returns which Nations have made for public Benefits confered upon them. The odious Vice, in either Case, receives its Aggravation in Proportion to the Mercies we have experienced, the Favours we have been blessed with, and the Character of our Benefactor: But should it extend to that Benificent Power, in whom we move, and have our being, and rob him of the return he challenges from his Creatures for his boundless Mercy and Love, it then assumes its most deformed Shape: It then receives its utmost Weight and Accumulation of Guilt.</P>
<P>ALL that is sacred or dear upon Earth—your Re∣ligion, your civil Rights and Liberties, the Enjoyment of your Property, the Freedom of your Persons, the Worship of your God, the Comfort of the Sacraments, the Presence and Exhortation of your Ministers—all that you possessed, and gloried in as British Subjects and as Christians, wrested from you by Violence and Oppression, while <HI>the Shepherds were smitten and the Sheep of the Flock scattered abroad</HI>—all these Blessings,
<PB N="9" REF="043111_0006_101CCC0565E92788"/>
valuable surely, if there be any so on this Side the Grave, and the dearer to you now for having been so cruelly deprived of them, hath your God begun to restore to you in this your Day; and with his stretched-out Arm, in a Manner visible to every Eye, brought you back to a Prospect of happier Days, and placed you again under the protecting Care of the ancient Guardians of your Religion and Liberty. And can it be possible that you should ever suffer the Remem∣brance of the divine Mercies, thus extended to you, to be blotted out from your Minds? It were doing wrong to those who have suffered with the Fortitude and Perseverance, the Loyalty and Attachment to their Sovereign, which have distinguished the Friends of Government in this Colony, even to suppose it. And I should hope that they who have endured so long and painful a Trial, rather than renounce their Loyalty, or the religious Principles on which that Loyalty is chiefly founded, will never hereafter be guilty of any Action, or pursue any Conduct, that can disgrace them as good Subjects, or as virtuous Christians.</P>
<P>BUT while I thus exhort you to persevere in your grateful Acknowledgments to the God of your Re∣demption, let me not neglect a Point of equal Import∣ance to you, equally acceptable to him. The Use, which in his gracious Providence he designs we should make of the Misconduct of others, or of the Punish∣ments which our Sins may have brought on ourselves, is frequently pointed out in the Scriptures. His Visitations he sets up as Marks to caution us against the Rocks and Shelves on which Folly and Vice have already caused so many to be wrecked; and wilfully to run upon them is to slight the divine Mercy—is an Aggravation of all our former Guilt, and justly exposes us to still more severe Ef∣fects of the Wrath of Heaven. The Psalmist, enume∣rating the various Calamities inflicted on the Israelites for their Incredulity and Disobedience, mentions, as a Source of additional Miseries to this stiff-necked Peo∣ple,
<PB N="10" REF="043111_0007_101CCC3896987068"/>
that they neglected to profit by their own fatal Ex∣perience, or the dreadful Examples they daily saw before their Eyes, of the Lord's Indignation. They refused to humble themselves beneath the divine Chastisement, but continued to provoke their Deliverer by fresh Proofs of Ingratitude. <HI>The Wrath of God came upon them, and smote down the chosen Men of Israel; for all this they sinned still—therefore their Days did he consume in Vanity, and their Years in Troubles.</HI> Entering into these Views, my Brethren, consider with me the Steps that have led your Country into its present Calamities—you will be the better enabled to check them in future, at least to decline and avoid them yourselves.—The Excesses of others will teach you a Lesson of Prudence and Mo∣deration to regulate your own Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>MY Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and med∣dle not with them that are given to change</HI>—was the excellent Rule laid down by the wisest of Men. Against those who transgress it, he denounces a sudden and inevitable Destruction. Whatever they may pro∣mise themselves,—However they may seem to prosper for a Time, Ruin, infallible Ruin, awaits them when least they expect it; nor is it possible to foresee the Miseries they may entail on themselves and their Descendants—"<HI>their Calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the Ruin of them both?</HI> The Words are remarkable, but they are dictated by Wisdom, and supported by Experience. It has happened from your former prosperous State, and the present Calamities of this Province, from which <HI>you</HI> happily begin to respire, that no Nation upon Earth can form a better Judgment upon this important Question than your∣selves; and I have before me, in this Assembly, a living Example to which alone I need refer.</P>
<P>CALL then to Mind the happy and prosperous Days this Colony enjoyed, when Loyalty to your Sove∣reign, Affection for the Constitution of your parent
<PB N="11" REF="043111_0008_101CCC08306DA4E0"/>
State, and Obedience to the Laws you enjoyed under its Protection, distinguished it above all the other Pro∣vinces of America. Your Condition was then an Object of Envy to Nations corrupted by the Refine∣ments of Luxury. Peace was in your Dwellings, Plenty in your Streets—Industry diffused her Blessings through your Fields with an increasing Profusion, giving Life to all the useful Arts, and nurturing them daily into Maturity and Perfection. The Produce of your Country flowed from your Port in a constant uninterrupted Stream, and you received in Return the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life, and all the Ele∣gancies which a free and extensive Commerce can bestow on a prudent and contented People. A friendly, hos∣pitable, and social Intercourse united you together as the Members of one Family, to the Admiration and Delight of Strangers who resided among you—you were blessed beyond the usual Lot of Men—Happy, completely so, did you but know how to value your Happiness, and to preserve it!</P>
<P>HOW different the Scene to which I must call off your Attention! what a Change of Prospect will the Reverse exhibit! where shall we seek for that Trea∣sure of Happiness which you could boast, when every Man sat under his own Vine, and eat his Bread with Chearfulness? Alas! Is it not wasted all, and con∣sumed in visionary Schemes, empty and fanciful as the Dreams of the Morning! Is it not squandered away in lawless and ungrateful Attempts, repugnant to every Principle divine and human? In Pursuits which plain Sense and Reason condemn, and at which even the Impulses of Nature must recoil? Peace, frightened from the Seats where once she loved to dwell, long since took her Flight from among you. Dissentions, party Rage, public Enmities, and private Animosities, usurped her Place, and brought with them a horrid Train of mutual Fears, Distrusts, and endless Jea∣lousies. By these were the Confidence and Harmony
<PB N="12" REF="043111_0009_101CCC3A218EF528"/>
of all social Intercourse destroyed; by these were the Bands of Love and Friendship torn asunder; by these were even the Ties of Consanguinity and Nature dis∣solved. Self-interest, Self-preservation, the Welfare of Posterity, Principles ingrafted in the human Mind by the benificent Creator, were all confounded and lost in this dark and dismal Night of Confusion, Anar∣chy, and Licentiousness. See Industry perverted from its useful Purposes, and employed in improving the Arts of Destruction. Your <HI>Plough-Shears</HI> it turned into <HI>Swords,</HI> and your <HI>Pruning-Hocks</HI> into <HI>Spears,</HI> the Re∣verse of the Blessing pronounced by <HI>Isaiah.</HI> See your Fields once cultivated, the Gardens of America, laid waste and turned into licentious Encampments and the desolating Scenes of War;—see your Commerce, your envied Commerce, destroyed, your Property seized and dissipated in Support of the Cause you abhored—your Liberties despised and trodden under Foot▪ and an arm∣ed Multitude insulting over your Miseries, turned loose upon your Possessions, and rioting in your Substance. In vain you looked up to Justice for Support—her Seats were overthrown, and trampled in the Dust; her Ru∣lers dispersed, and the People abandoned to every wild Impulse of Humour and Passion, without Laws, with∣out Magistrates, without Form of Government. In short, too well might we apply to you the Words of Jeremiah—<HI>If you went forth into the Fields, behold the Slain with the Sword; if you entered into the City, behold she that was full of Inhabitants, and Princess among the Provinces, sitting solitary, and become as a disconsolate,</HI> childless <HI>Widow.—Both the Prophet and the Priest went about in a Land they knew not—your Friends dealt treach∣erously with you, and became your Enemies, while you were gone into Captivity, because of Affliction, and because of great Servitude.</HI></P>
<P>To what Causes are we to attribute this deplorable Change? Whence is it that you can say to yourselves, Such was the Happiness we once could boast; such the melancholy Reverse we have experienced! I have
<PB N="13" REF="043111_0010_101CCC0AD5C86A80"/>
heard some attribute it to the Imperfection of human Nature, incapable of enjoying a durable State of Pros∣perity, and oftentimes most discontented, when blessed with the greatest Cause of Content. But I shall search for it among the Sources of the Decay and Fall of Na∣tions, which the Scriptures of God point out to me. Warranted by these, I shall not hesitate to assert, that if this Province had continued <HI>to fear the Lord, and the King, and had not meddled with those who are given to change</HI>; the Tempest would have spent its Rage at a Distance from you, and Peace, Industry, and Happi∣ness would still have blessed your Dwellings, as they did of old. You, indeed, my Friends, seem to have been well convinced of this Truth. The Struggle you maintained was vigorous, and for some Time successful —But all were not animated with your Spirit. The Love of Novelty—or whatever other Causes the Pow∣ers of Darkness best can tell—for it is impossible to ac∣count for such Folly and Madness on any known Prin∣ciples—seduced too many from their Allegiance to their Sovereign, and their former happy Attachment to the British Constitution; and these ancient Barriers be∣ing once removed, all the Disorders that have well nigh overthrown your Country, broke in upon you, and the Depression of your Religion, for the Time, follow∣ed of Course. So true it is, that when Restlessness and Discontent once possess the Mind, it is impossible to foresee to what Extremes a Rage for Innovation, and a Passion for Change, will transport their Votaries. They are like the <HI>unclean Spirit</HI> mentioned in the Gos∣pel, always on the Wing, <HI>seeking</HI> a Place of <HI>Rest,</HI> but <HI>never finding it.</HI> Excesses, at which Men would have shuddered at their first setting out, <HI>swept clean,</HI> and placed in a delusive Point of View by Faction and Party, lose their Deformity, and daily make Way for other Excesses still more criminal, still more enormous. These dissatisfied <HI>Spirits take to themselves other Spirits more wicked than themselves, and the last State of these Men becomes worse than the first.</HI> I need not make the Ap∣plication
<PB N="14" REF="043111_0011_101CCC3D29ED3EF0"/>
—It is but too manifest—you have already done it for me.</P>
<P>I HAVE said that when too many of this Pro∣vince suffered themselves to be seduced from their Allegiance to their Sovereign, and their former happy Attachment to the British Constitution, the Depression of your Religion followed of Course—Let me not be misunderstood—I mean not to engage in an invidious Point of Controversy, which has often been carried to such fatal Lengths. Religious Disputes obtrude them∣selves too frequently into Subjects of mere political Concern, and serve no other End than to widen Divi∣sions, and encrease Animosities, which the Holy System, the Interests of which they would seem to support, would wish to allay forever. Warmed with Zeal for their parti∣cular Tenets, however unessentially differing from each other, the Passions of the Disputants work themselves into the Controversy, and we are apt to ascribe their rash and intemperate Dictates to that System, the De∣fence of which they have embraced. There is also another Prejudice, which is apt to lead us astray in this important Matter. As in the different Forms of Government, at present established throughout the Christian World, Religion is fundamentally connected with their civil and political Institutes; we generally consider them as going Hand in Hand, and charge the Creed of each particular Sect with the political Errors and Disorders of its Professors. A Church there is, indeed, whose Principles have been proved by fatal Ex∣perience to be so essentially inconsistent with every No∣tion of free and rational Government, so infallibly in∣troductive of a double Slavery, forging Chains both for the Body and Mind, that it has been deservedly branded with this foul Imputation, and justly abhorred by Na∣tions jealous of their Liberties. But that among Pro∣testant Churches, such a Charge should be urged and retorted by each other, with so much Virulence and Animosity, hath long been a Cause of Grief to every
<PB N="15" REF="043111_0012_101CCC0D8CBF9C60"/>
Well-wisher of the Reformed Religion, and a great Subject of Triumph to their common Enemies, both at home and abroad. Let me not attempt to enlarge the Breach, or be guilty of an Error, which I condemn in others. I shall only observe, that in every Age, in every State, there are Men of depraved Hearts, who put on Religion as a Cloak to cover their sinister Views; or use it as a political Tool to work upon the Minds of the Weak, and uninstructed, and all, whose Zeal without Knowledge renders them an easy Prey to the Arts of Seducers. These, like the Lame and Impo∣tent at the Pool of Bethesda, watch the Troubling of the Waters, that they may be the first to take Ad∣vantage of the public Commotions, and on the Ruins of the Peace and Happiness of their Country, pave the Way to their own Advancement: Men, who declaim against every Power, but that which they have them∣selves usurped; to whom the Pretence of the public Good, and the Interests of their Country, is as easy as that of Religion; and who assume both in com∣mon with every restless Malecontent, who in every Age, under every Government, has destroyed the Peace of the Christian World.</P>
<P>FROM what Causes <HI>your</HI> Sufferings may have origi∣nated, this is not the Time, nor the Place to consider. Too certain it is, that they have now risen to such a Height of Aggravation, as needs no Words to repre∣sent to you—You feel it beyond the Energy of Words. The smart of recent Wrongs, and former Injuries, speaks a Language which those who sympathize with you in your Sufferings, can never adopt. Whatever the Principles of your Persecutors may be, their unre∣lenting Malice is but too notorious; and they have ad∣ded to all their former Excesses, a Deed of Atrocious∣ness which must open the Eyes of the most infatuated— must totally alienate even the small Numbers, who may have hitherto been deluded into some favourable Opinion of their Cause. To what a Scene were you
<PB N="16" REF="043111_0013_101CCC4015759B48"/>
Witnesses the Night before last! When just escaped from the Storm, and imagining yourselves arrived at a Port of Rest; labouring to collect together the small Remains of your Fortune that had escaped the general Wreck; meeting once more and embracing, after so long and painful a Separation, the Objects of your tenderest Affection, or solacing yourselves with the Hopes of being speedily re-united to those who were yet detained in Bondage from you; congratulating your Friends on your mutual Deliverance, and the Prospect that was opening to you of returning Peace, Quiet and Security—In this Dawn of your Hopes and Expecta∣tions, to awake at the Midnight Hour and find your City in Flames; to see your All perishing before your Eyes, and to know that your Destroyers were secretly among you, spreading the Ruin, and exulting in the Success of their infernal Scheme!</P>
<P>THIS was not the sudden Act of a vanquished and flying Enemy, perpetrated in the peevish Moment of Disappointment and Defeat, or contrived to favour their Escape. No,—several Days had elapsed since their Flight, and Quiet seemed to have revisited you under the Banner of your Deliverers. Even the base Incendiaries returned among you, wearing the Mask of Peace. We hoped that they had repented of their Excesses—had been convinced of their Folly and Mad∣ness, and meant to embrace the profered Clemency of their Sovereign, who was willing to forget the un∣grateful Revolt against his Authority, their Contempt of his Crown and Government, and the Insults of∣fered to his Person. But they cried, <HI>Peace, Peace, when there was no Peace.</HI> The Blow they were medi∣tating was the more dangerous from its being thus con∣cealed—they gloried in striking it home, and no∣thing, under Heaven, but the Activity of your En∣glish Friends, could have prevented the whole City's falling a Victim to their determined Malice. Yes, my Friends, ye were Witnesses of it.—Ye saw the treach∣erous Adherents of these pretended Guardians of your
<PB N="17" REF="043111_0014_101CCC104E7D0F88"/>
Rights and Possessions, who came to rescue you from Tyranny and Oppression, armed with Firebrands, and un∣der Cover of the Darkness wrapping your City in Flames —Ye saw the brave and generous Servants of your King, —that King, whom you have so often heard repre∣sented as a Tyrant, who sends forth his Fleets and Ar∣mies to enslave, ravage, destroy,—flying to the Assist∣ance of their fellow Subjects, in the Midst of the Flames, at the Hazard of their Lives, exerting every Nerve to preserve your Dwellings and Possessions, and tearing from the Hands of the dark Incendiaries the In∣struments they had prepared for your Destruction. Had it pleased Heaven, that the Success could have answered their Zeal, so many Families once blessed with Comfort and Affluence, would not have been turned out on the World, naked, helpless, and stripped of their All.— The Seminary of indigent Merit, where Poverty found a Resource against Ignorance, and where Charity re∣claimed Thousands from Idleness and Dissipation to Virtue and Industry, would yet have stood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Fire of Saturday, Sept. 21, a Thousand Houses, nearly One Fourth of the City, were laid in Ashes. Trinity Church, the public Charity School, the Rector's House, and a Lutheran Chapel, were among the Buildings that were consumed.—The Loss sustained in Houses, &amp;c. by the Corporation of Trinity Church, amounts, at a moderate Computation, to THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS, New-York Currency.</NOTE> The Mansion of your worthy and reverend Minister, whose Absence you still regret, and the Possessions appropri∣ated for the Support of your Clergy, would not have perished, and added to the Distresses they have already suffered on your Account and their own.—But <HI>ye smitten and afflicted,</HI> who beheld your <HI>Destruction coming</HI> on you <HI>like a Whirlwind,</HI> and saw the Work of Ages, the Fruits of your own Industry, and the Labour of your Ancestors, swept off in the Space of a Moment, whither could ye have fled from the Rage of your Ene∣mies? Not even the Temples of the Lord were sacred from their Fury—his Altars could afford you no Sanctu∣ary. The Mother of your Churches, the Ornament of your Worship, the first Edifice which the Piety of your
<PB N="18" REF="043111_0015_101CCC4530E77090"/>
Ancestors had raised to the God of their Fathers, in Gratitude for his Mercies in a strange Land, was mark∣ed out for certain Destruction. Some Child of Per∣dition claimed to himself the Merit of this daring Sa∣crilege, and involved the ancient and venerable Pile in the same Ruin with which they designed to extirpate all the Monuments of your Religion, every Vestige of your ancient Splendor and Glory.</P>
<P>IN this Scene of universal Danger and Distress, to what can the Ministers of God exhort you? Ill should we know <HI>what Manner of Spirit we were of,</HI> if we suffered any Expressions, that may have fallen from us, to be interpreted into a Breach of Charity, the Crown of Christian Virtues; or into a Design of sharpening the Virulence of Party, or encreasing Animosities that have already too fatally destroyed <HI>the Peace</HI> of your <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> To minister some Consolation in your Sufferings, as becometh the Teachers of the Gospel, who must be unworthy indeed of the Character they bear, not to feel for the Afflictions of their Brethren, who look to them for Comfort and Instruction; to set before you <HI>the loving Kindnesses of the Lord,</HI> and the Redemption he hath wrought in your Favour, and to exhort you to make every becoming Return for his Mercies and Love; to point out to you, and warn you against the Abuses that have brought Ruin upon your Country—this has been our only Aim.—If we have succeeded, all our Wishes are satisfied, and we shall have the Consolation to think that you will sanctify this Day, as becometh Christians—by Prayer and Thanks∣giving; by Repentance for past Sins, and Resolutions of an Amendment of Life; by practising the <HI>Duties</HI> of that Religion, for the <HI>Interests</HI> of which you have mani∣fested such Zeal and Attachment; by laying aside all Malice, Hatred, and Desire of Revenge; by commit∣ting your Cause to the Justice of God, and waiting with Resignation for the further Accomplishment of his gracious Designs. He who can <HI>still the raging of the
<PB N="19" REF="043111_0016_101CCC1462E9BE80"/>
Seas,</HI> knows best how to restore Peace and Tranquility to your distracted Country. May he correct the Hearts, and enlighten the Understandings of your infatuated Brethren, who still refuse to contribute their Endeavours towards healing these unhappy Disputes. And while their Example proves a Warning to you,—while, in their Conduct, you consider the Excesses to which those may be transported, who once pass the ancient Bounds of lawful and settled Government, may God give you Grace to attach yourselves the more firmly to our happy Constitution both in Church and State.</P>
<P>HUMBLY, and with all due prostration of Heart, I shall venture to affirm that your Cause is his own. It is the Cause of Peace, Loyalty, and sound Reason, exposed to the Attempts of misguided Men, whom he seems to have given over to a Blindness of Heart that hurries them into all the Violence and Artifice of Sedi∣tion, Frenzy and Rebellion. Fear not then, my Friends, but in his own Time <HI>his Wisdom will order all Things sweetly.</HI> In the mean Time, learn to resign yourselves to whatever Means he may be pleased to employ for that End, and humble yourselves beneath his chastising, but fatherly Hand. Would to God I could say that the Danger were past! But Treachery perhaps, still lurketh amongst you. Let every Man, therefore, be careful and vigilant. Nature requires, and Religion approves, that we should make Use of the Means, which Providence hath put into our Power for our Protection and Safety. But let this be your chief Dependance, that he <HI>who is with you, is</HI> greater <HI>than they</HI> who are against you.—He from whom alone your Safety can come, <HI>neither slumbers nor sleeps.</HI> Tho' your Enemies may hope <HI>that the Darkness shall cover them, the Darkness is no darkness with Him.</HI> He will not let them <HI>have their Desire,</HI> nor their <HI>mischievous Ima∣gination prosper.</HI> Let the Sense of the common Danger to which you are exposed, and the Fellowship of your past Sufferings, strengthen the Ties of Charity
