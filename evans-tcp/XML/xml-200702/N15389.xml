<P>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee: —</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOLEMN and deeply affecting to the feeling mind is the present scene!—We here behold a truly pitiable object, one of our guilty race, who, left to the guidance of an uninstructed mind; or rather to the uncontrouled in∣fluence of the direful passions, malice and revenge, has per∣petrated a crime which freezes the mind with horror.— She has been summoned before the Civil Tribunal; and, after a fair and impartial trial, was convicted of the crime for which she is this day to suffer.</P>
<P>The cry of innocent blood hath <HI>entered into the ears of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Sabaoth</HI>; but this day will silence its claims. — YES; in a few hours, will be executed the fatal, the tremen∣dous sentence which puts a period to the life of one, who had never learned to live.—In the beginning of life, a <HI>murderer,</HI> Justice forbids that she should live out half her days: for—
<PB N="6" REF="019547_0004_0FABF95A35C872A8"/>
<HI>Whose sheddeth Man's blood, by Man shall his blood be shed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 9.6.</NOTE> This is the voice of Justice and of the GOD of Justice: There∣fore "<HI>a man that doth violence to the blood of any person, shall flee to the pit—let no man stay him.</HI>"<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prov. 28.17.</NOTE></P>
<P>The present season is all-important:—How shall I answer its claims?—On the one hand, the poor prisoner loudly claims every moment as her own: for that her last sands are now falling, and that in a few hours she must launch into that world whence there is no return.—On the other hand, are the interests of this numerous assembly of fellow-men, who are also soon, very soon to close this mortal life; and the eternal state of each be determined according to his present improvement of divine instruction.—And, how big with important in∣struction is the melancholy event, of which we are this day to be witnesses!—Principally then to my Auditory let the present opportunity be devoted.</P>
<P>To this I the more readily consent, from a conviction of the impracticability of adapting a Discourse, upon this occasion▪ to the improvement of one who, until within a few weeks, was ignorant of the first principles of Religion; having been left to heathenish darkness in a Christian land. Yes; my brethren, this poor prisoner, when committed to gaol, ap∣peared to have no higher principle than the pleasure of gratifying her ungoverned passions.—And so far from having the fear of GOD before her eyes—<HI>O tell it not in Gath!</HI> —she hath repeatedly declared to me, that she did not know that there was a GOD, before she was told it after her imprisonment.</P>
<P>Are there any in this assembly whose consciences reproach them with the same cruel inattention to <HI>their</HI> Children and Servants? Such are this day called to their duty in language which must pierce a Parent's heart. May every spectator of this day's painful scene, learn the importance of faithfulness in the relations of Parent and Master.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019547_0005_0FABF95B36D5AC88"/>The melancholy event, which we are now called to con∣template, speaks to us in thunder from the Mercy-Seat.— Though wrath is kindled against us; yet HEAVEN addresses us as he did his chosen people: <HI>Be thou instructed, O Jerusa∣lem, lest my soul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>I may not enlarge in shewing the occasion of this passage: —<HI>For this I say, brethren, the time is short.—What thou doest, do quickly.</HI>—In a word therefore: this passage was delivered by the Prophet in the name of the LORD, at a time when Judah had almost filled up the mea∣sure of her iniquities, and exhausted the patience of her GOD. In the verse preceding our text we have her charac∣ter. <HI>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds.</HI> Then follows our text: in which we behold the mercy and compassion of her GOD. Though he had <HI>sent unto them all his servants the Prophets, saying, Obey my voice and I will be your GOD, and ye shall be my people. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and imaginations of their evil heart.</HI> GOD, at length wearied with their incorrigibleness, is about to <HI>pour cut upon them the fury of his just indignation.</HI>—Yet, <HI>how shall I give thee up Ephraim!</HI>—Mercy interposeth and tenderly persuades. <HI>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart,</HI> or as the original more strongly expresses it, <HI>be disjointed from thee.</HI> We hasten to apply this passage to the present occasion: in doing which, let us</P>
<P N="1">I. Attend particularly to the instruction which GOD, in righteous judgment, is this day calling us to receive.</P>
<P N="2">II. Consider the argument by which attention to this in∣struction is here enforced.—<HI>Lest my soul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST. We are to attend particularly to the instruction which GOD, in righteous judgment, is <HI>this day</HI> calling us to receive.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019547_0006_0FABF95BB40E7E08"/>Various are the ways in which the MOST HIGH instructs his people.—His works lie as an open volume to be read by all. <HI>The invisible things of GOD from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,</HI> even <HI>his eternal power and Godhead.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. 1.20.</NOTE>—His Word speaks in plainer language; and <HI>is profitable to direct,</HI> to make <HI>the man of GOD perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3.17.</NOTE></P>
<P>But these means of instruction, without the special influen∣ces of divine grace, are of no avail:—For, the heart of the children of men being <HI>fully set in them to do evil▪ they hear∣ken not, nor incline their ear. We have loved</HI> pleasures, <HI>and after them will we go.</HI></P>
<P>But, when GOD speaks in the thunders of <HI>Judgment; the people,</HI> if not left to a judicial blindness and hardness of heart, <HI>hear and fear and do no more such wickedness. By thy Judg∣ments,</HI> said David, <HI>is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</HI> The adverse events of Provi∣dence, frequently, affect those whom nothing else could affect. —Sensible objects gain attention, where an address to the understanding will not be heard. The Senses are an avenue by which there is an easy access to the heart. When this is brought to espouse the cause of virtue, the understanding is easily convinced.</P>
<P>The melancholy event, of which we are this day to be witnesses, considered with all its attendant circumstances, addresses every tender feeling, and cannot fail to reach the heart.—Struck with horror at the bloody deed—Amazed at such an instance of <HI>cruelty</HI> and <HI>revenge</HI> in one so young.— And every tender emotion of the soul awakened at beholding this early victim sacrificed to Justice:—Will not every one present, with earnestness enquire—Wherefore has our land been thus stained with a crime, which, with all its painful circumstances, it has never known before? Wherefore are we called to this scene of woe?—<HI>What doth the LORD require of us?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019547_0007_0FABF95CAFB43050"/>I answer, <HI>in the name of the LORD,</HI> that ye resolve with his Servant of old—<HI>I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: I will walk</HI> WITHIN MY HOUSE <HI>with a perfect heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 101.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Shameful and unpardonable, my brethren, is the almost universal neglect of family Instruction and Government. One of the truly unhappy consequences of this neglect, we behold in the ignominious end of this poor girl who is now to pay the forfeit of life into the hands of justice. <HI>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>When I reflect on the nature of the duties in which GOD is now instructing us, to which therefore we are now to at∣tend; I could wish that the speaker had been such an one as "Paul the <HI>Aged,</HI>" rather than the Youth whom the request of the prisoner has called to address you upon this occa∣sion. But since this may not be, permit me, with that respect which is due to my auditory, in the warmth of love to my Country and the Souls of men, and with that fidelity which I owe to our great Master and LORD, to point out some of those duties; to the discharge of which you are obli∣gated as <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI>; and to the neglect of which the melancholy scene of this day is in a great measure to be charged.</P>
<P N="1">I. Family Devotion, though a very unfashionable, is, however, a very important part of the duty of the Head of a family, if he would <HI>walk in his house with a perfect heart.</HI> —"Every house should be a Bethel, and every master of a family, in his house, a priest of the MOST HIGH GOD." A daily <HI>reverential</HI> attendance upon this duty, early impresses the young mind with a sense of the divine omnipresence, and teacheth the fear of that GOD whose <HI>eyes are in every place.</HI> Shall the heathen, my brethren, guided by the dim light of Nature, bow down at their family altars; and shall the fa∣milies, in which the Sun of Righteousness shines with the clear light of divine Revelation, pay no worship to the true
<PB N="10" REF="019547_0008_0FABF96E2C2C6D08"/>
GOD?—Are there no family wants to be supplied? No family blessings to be acknowledged?—Or are we like Israel of old, "who sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play?" —"She did not know, saith GOD by his Prophet, that I gave her corn and wine and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal: Therefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof; and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hosea 2.8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Children and Servants should be early taught to read. This is an advantage which the children in a family generally enjoy. But are not our servants, my brethren, too often for∣gotten? How few have the means of instruction? Most of those who have, instead of being spurred to that applica∣tion, without which there can be no proficiency, are constantly interrupted by our many calls. At length ambition flags, and, being discouraged, they trifle away the little time allotted them. Their consequent little progress is now imputed to a want of genius peculiar to their complexion.—Now, distinguished from his brethren, and highly favoured will be that servant, who is not left, either to heathenish darkness in a <HI>Christian land,</HI> or to spell out unassisted the principles of Religion, and every truth which respects his eternal salvation. Hard is their lot!—Humanity drop a tear.—I would here anticipate an objection which may perhaps be made to the idea of <HI>duty</HI> in the relation of Masters to Servants.</P>
<P>Objection. Servants bought with our money are our abso∣lute property: and may we not do as we will with our own?</P>
<P>While he, who is not steeled to the feelings of a generous mind, blushes at this objection; I am not careful to answer in this matter. But, in a word;—they are not your own: for they <HI>are bought with a price.</HI> If you alienate them from his service who hath <HI>bought them even with his own blood,</HI> the debt contracted on your part will, I fear, render you in∣solvent,
<PB N="11" REF="019547_0009_0FABF96E76A201F8"/>
and consign you to that prison whence there is no discharge <HI>'till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</HI>—The blood of souls will be charged to your account.—Think well, —How will you discharge it?—I hasten to another part of the duty under consideration.</P>
<P N="3">3. Early instil the great principles of Religion and Vir∣tue. —Those under our care should be taught that great first principle of Religion—<HI>There is a GOD.</HI>—As the young mind enlarges, it should be made acquainted with the glori∣ous Perfections of GOD. This will lead to explain and en∣force our obligations to him as our Creator, Preserver and Redeemer. Did the Redeemer when on earth take little children into his arms and bless them? Can <HI>Christians</HI> then forget to devote theirs to him who thus loved them?— Point them to their Saviour on the cross, and let his agoni∣zing death teach them the evil of sin, and its dreadful punish∣ment. The beauties of holiness and its glorious rewards, are also to be set before them in language adapted to their capacities, and calculated to reach the heart.</P>
<P>The beginning of our days is an important part of hu∣man life.</P>
<P>"Just as the twig is bent the Tree is inclin'd."</P>
<P>The subsequent periods of life will take their stamp from that of childhood. Happy is it when the first impressions are in savour of virtue. To effect this there must <HI>be line upon line, and precept upon precept.</HI> The first openings of the mind are to be carefully watched; and every opportunity of in∣stilling that which is good, faithfully improved.</P>
<P>Here, I am aware, will start up that frightful spectre, <HI>pre∣judice of education</HI>; with which some men appear panic-struck. To deliver themselves from this, they exert themselves to the utmost: 'till at length, having effected their purpose, their lives shew that to be delivered from, what they call, the prejudice of education is, in other terms, to be divested of every virtuous and religious principle. Far be it, however, from any one to suppose that we should have no higher sup∣port
<PB N="12" REF="019547_0010_0FABF970722F6598"/>
for our principles in religion and virtue, than education. —A slender support indeed!—No; my brethren, the mind properly cultivated will, when matured by age, know its own importance, and search <HI>whether those things are so</HI> which it had received as true.</P>
<P>That the mind of man, in the first buddings of reason, discovers an ardent thirst for knowledge, and, incapable of determining the quality of what is offered, drinks in with avidity what is first presented is a truth which will not be disputed.—Since then the mind cannot be kept a blank until brought to maturity: Those, who do not chuse to give vir∣tuous principles the first possession, must, unavoidably give this advantage to those which are vicious. That Society may long be secured against the influence of minds thus early formed to the service of the enemy of all Righteousness, will be the prayer of every friend to virtue and his country.— But to pursue our subject:</P>
<P>With the knowledge of GOD is connected that of our duty to Him, our Neighbour and ourselves. Every duty should be clearly explained and the discharge of it strictly enjoined. Thus did the Father of the faithful approve him∣self faithful in all his house:—GOD himself bearing witness for him. <HI>I know Abraham,</HI> said he, <HI>that he will command his children, and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 18.19.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. To private instruction is to be added the public in∣structions of the House of GOD. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. 87.2.</NOTE> Here those committed to our care behold the worship and order of the Gospel, with its Ordinances and Instructions:—hear the word of salvation at the mouth of the <HI>Messenger of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts</HI>:—and learn that <HI>fear of the LORD which is the beginning of wisdom, and that knowledge of the holy which is understanding.</HI> For this purpose was the direction given, Deut. 31.12, 13.
<Q>Gather the people together, men and women and CHILDREN, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and
<PB N="13" REF="019547_0011_0FABF979B4CB32A0"/>
fear the LORD your GOD, and observe to do all the words of this Law;—and that their CHILDREN, which have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your GOD.</Q></P>
<P>When we attend with our children upon the public instruc∣tion, the great object in view should be to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD.—This, however, will not be the weightier matter of the law where the Pulpit is prostituted to serve the interests of a party—But, the faithful Minister of that Religion which breathes Charity and good-will to man, will not distinguish himself in the sacred desk, by uttering severe invectives or artful insinuations a∣gainst the Ministers and Churches of other denominations.— When this takes place, one says, <HI>I am of Paul</HI>; another, <HI>I am of Apollos.</HI>—But my brethren, let it be your concern that you and your children <HI>may be of CHRIST.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. The beginnings of an amiable disposition are to be cultivated. This supposes that we study the dispositions of those under our care: that we may be able to distinguish the good from the bad. The tempers of mankind are vari∣ous, and require as different modes of cultivation as the various soils under the hand of the discerning husbandman. The tender benevolent disposition is already fitted for the seed. Hasten therefore to scatter the good seed, and 'ere long it shall <HI>yield a joyful crop.</HI></P>
<P>The first dawnings of that which is amiable and praise∣worthy should be encouraged.—Particularly: that ingenuous sincerity which gives the impress of gold to every other virtue:—an unshaken attachment to truth:—a modest and respectful deportment towards Superiors: an obliging atten∣tion to Equals: an easy condescention to Inferiors: and that compassion for those in distress which leads to imitate him who <HI>went about doing good.</HI> A mind, thus liberally endowed, should not be left unguarded against that by which <HI>many strong men have been slain.</HI> Therefore those under our care should be early inspired with sentiments which will raise them superior to irregular desires, and <HI>fleshly lusts which war against
<PB N="14" REF="019547_0012_0FABF97B56E8F998"/>
the soul.</HI> These too often like a strong man armed take cap∣tive the unguarded Youth, and lead him to the <HI>strange wo∣man, whose house is the way to hell, going down to the cham∣bers of death.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. 7.27.</NOTE>—This leads to observe,</P>
<P N="6">6. The beginnings of a vicious disposition should receive an early and effectual check. Vices are like those weeds which, having once taken root, are with the utmost diffi∣culty destroyed. A bad natural disposition if not early sub∣dued will, 'ere long, bring forth nothing but briars and thorns, to pierce a parent's heart with many sorrows. To prevent this too often unhappy case: the command of a parent should enforce the motives to virtue. Thus did David com∣mand Solomon, when instructing him in the way of wisdom. <HI>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the GOD of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for∣ever.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 28.9.</NOTE> But the language of parental <HI>authority</HI> in all cases should be the last resource. When the yearnings of parental tenderness in the mild and gentle language of persuasion prove ineffectual, then the decisive tone of authority becomes necessa∣ry. <HI>Withold not correction from the child,</HI> saith Solomon, <HI>for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die.—Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. 23.13, 14.</NOTE> Here, however, excessive severity becomes equally prejudicial with an excess of indulgence: for "human nature is like the spring of an engine, which, being forcibly pressed, upon the first liberty returns back with so much the greater violence." Happy is he who knows the golden mean; who can temper the severity of reproof with the tenderness of a parent.</P>
<P>A due proportion should ever be observed between the crime and the punishment. While lighter offences are passed with a gentle rebuke; more heinous crimes call for greater severity. A light reproof in the latter case would countenance rather than correct the offence: and, let me add, the parent or master would not be guiltless. Heavy is the charge brought
<PB N="15" REF="019547_0013_0FABF97C072D3820"/>
by Heaven against Eli, for his indulgence to his sons, when they made themselves vile, and wounded Religion by their impiety. For their aggravated wickedness they receive this gentle rebuke from their father:—<HI>Why do ye such things: for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people; Nay, my sons: for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people to transgress.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 2.23, 24.</NOTE> This is construed into a neglect on the part of the father; for which the rod of the Almighty came upon him and his house. <HI>For I have told him,</HI> said the LORD to Samuel, <HI>that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 3.13.</NOTE> We may not here point out very particularly where paren∣tal restraint is necessary. Every thing that savours of impiety or a contempt of GOD and his service should not be so much as named among children. <HI>But above all things,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>James 5.12.</HI> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, &amp;c.</NOTE> restrain them from that prophane abuse of the sacred name of GOD, with which the virtuous ear is, at this day, so often wounded. To effect this it may be sufficient, having before taught them the fear of the LORD, to shew them how pitiable in the sight of observers, is the character of that man who, without even the shadow of honour, pleasure or profit in return, can wan∣tonly trifle with his Maker, and thus <HI>sell his soul for nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Further, parental restraint should extend to every thing which is opposed to that <HI>good name which is better than pre∣cious ointment.</HI>—Here I cannot but particularly mention those servile vices, falshood and dishonesty. These discover a meanness of soul incompatible with the manly virtues.</P>
<Q><L>"A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod;</L>
<L>"An <HI>honest man's</HI> the noblest work of GOD."</L></Q>
<P>To be just to ourselves, our neighbour and our GOD, is the sum of moral virtue: for <HI>he hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy GOD?</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Micah 6.8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="019547_0014_0FABF97CB071DB00"/>The smallest deviation from the path of righteousness will, even in early life, give a wound to reputation which will not be easily healed. To the consideration I might add that of the numerous unhappy instances, in which the little <HI>pilferings</HI> of childhood passing unpunished have arisen to that height of wickedness which is to be punished by the Judges; and thus the end is public infamy, or an ignominious death. Therefore it is of the last importance that children should learn to conform every action to the golden rule of equity.— <HI>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.</HI> This great law of benevolence and justice cannot be too early inculcated or too deeply impressed on the mind while tender.—But I have already been more particular than I intended.—</P>
<P>Yet with the striking instance before us of the truly melan∣choly consequences of furious and ungoverned passions, I may not pass on without urging the absolute necessity of a very early restraint upon these. When Anger, Malice and direful <HI>Revenge</HI> get possession of the heart of man; he be∣comes a monster, an enemy to Society and fit only to her<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with his fellow-monsters of the desert. <HI>Cursed be that anger which is fierce, and that wrath which is cruel!</HI>—Where is contention? Where is <HI>murder</HI> and every evil work? In the heart of the furious and <HI>revengeful</HI> man.—<HI>O my soul, come not thou into his secret; unto his assembly, mine honour, be not thou united.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Enforce your instruction by your own <HI>example.</HI> It is a common though very just observation, that example goes before precept. Those heads of families who indulge them∣selves in furious passions,—intemperance,—falshood,— dishonesty,—prophane swearing—or an impious contempt of God and Religion will be found, with respect to those under their care, <HI>blind leaders of the blind.</HI> To these the words of the apostle, apply.—<HI>Thou therefore who teachest ano∣ther, teachest thou not thyself?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 2.21.</NOTE></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="17" REF="019547_0015_0FABF97D71B0A078"/>8. Finally, Brethren, <HI>pray</HI> for your families. <HI>Except the LORD keep the City the watchman waketh but in vain.</HI>— Without the blessing of the kind Parent of the Universe; the anxious concern, faithful instruction and prudent govern∣ment of an affectionate parent will end in disappointment and sorrow. To the Father of mercies, therefore, who <HI>like as a father pitieth his children; pitieth them that fear him:</HI> apply earnestly and with unceasing supplication for the bles∣sing of an affectionate and dutiful family.—Whether this be a blessing worth <HI>wrestling</HI> for with the GOD of Jacob: ye who are parents best can tell.</P>
<P>I must now hasten, remembering that <HI>the time is short</HI> and with brevity,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. Consider the argument by which attention to divine instruction is enforced in the text.—<HI>Lest my soul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>By this is to be understood, the withdrawing from a Na∣tion, a Family or an Individual the gracious presence of that GOD, <HI>in whose hand it is to make great,</HI> and by whom <HI>the haughtiness of man is bowed down.</HI></P>
<P>Thus when a people favoured of the LORD will not hearken nor incline their ear to his instruction; their national bles∣sings are accursed from Heaven, and their pleasures will be bitterness in the latter end. Though for a season they may be prospered, and riot in the bounties of Providence; yet let them not flatter themselves with security, while that hand can reach them, which plucked down from the height of national dignity the peculiar people of the Most High. <HI>They are waxen fat,</HI> said GOD by his Prophet, <HI>they shine: yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the Cause, the Cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper: and the right of the needy do they not judge.

<P><PB N="18" REF="019547_0016_0FABF97E5F509DE8"/>But the present occasion leads me to consider the argument in the text, more particularly as it respects divine instruction addressed to families. The argument in this view implies, that, when Heads of families are instructed in their duty, if they refuse and will not hear, the LORD will withdraw his presence from them and write their dearest blessings accursed. For such GOD hath his quiver full of arrows which will pierce them to the heart.</P>
<P>Dutiful and obedient children are an <HI>heritage of the LORD.</HI> Isaac was the obedient son of the father of the faithful: at whose command he yielded himself as a lamb to the slaughter. Faithful Eliezer of Damascus was the servant of Abraham who was faithful in all his house. These are among the bles∣sings of that man who is instructed out of the Law of the LORD. <HI>Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that de∣lighteth greatly in his commandments. His seed shall be mighty upon the earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth forever.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. 112.1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>But those, who, though they acknowledge the fear of the LORD, will not regard his instruction; being found unfaithful in their houses; will realize the withdrawing of the divine pre∣sence in the fate of an unfaithful Eli: to whom was fulfilled the following message from the LORD. <HI>Them that honour me I will honour: and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. Behold, the days come that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house; that there shall not be an old man in thine house. And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 2.31, 33.</NOTE> These evils, I might add, are the natural consequences of too great parental indulgence. Ap∣petites and passions unrestrained in childhood, become furious in youth; and ensure <HI>dishonour, disease</HI> and an <HI>untimely</HI> death. So true it is that <HI>a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. 25.15.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>May I now be permitted to apply the subject in particular addresses—<HI>First,</HI>—to HEADS OF FAMILIES.</P>
<P><HI>Fathers and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Permit one to address you upon this occasion, who acknow∣ledges that he knows not the joys or sorrows of a <HI>Parent</HI>'s breast: yet, GOD forbid that he should be a stranger to that respect and warmth of affection which becomes a <HI>Son:</HI> for <HI>he was his father's son, tender and beloved in the sight of his mother.</HI> Suffer me then: while with fidelity as in the sight of GOD, yet affectionately and with all respect I <HI>intreat an elder as a father and the elder women as mothers.</HI></P>
<P>I do now beseech you, in Christ's stead, that you attend to the solemn admonitions of Heaven this day. <HI>Be thou instruc∣ted, O Jerusalem!</HI> Let this instance of aggravated wicked∣ness in one so young, alarm your fears for the little ones committed to your care, and engage you to be just to your∣selves, to your <HI>Children,</HI> to Society and to your GOD. <HI>The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 3.33.</NOTE></P>
<P>The happiness of an affectionate parent depends much upon the conduct of his children. For the truth of this, fathers, I might appeal to yourselves: And doubt not, but that with feelings known only to a <HI>parent</HI> you would declare, with So∣lomon, <HI>a wise son maketh a glad father; but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</HI></P>
<P>But if the happiness of parents thus depends upon their children, may we not expect that that happiness which is real and permanent will be preferred? What then can we think of those, who rise up early and sit up late and eat the bread of carefulness that they may leave an inheritance to their chil∣dren: while the provision for their minds is scarcely thought

of? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make to themselves wings; they fly away</HI>; but a good education is a durable portion. <HI>Wisdom is the prin∣cipal thing, therefore get wisdom; and with all thy getting, get understanding.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. 4.7.</NOTE> <HI>Surely every man walketh in a vain shew, surely they are disquieted in vain; for he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. 39.6.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is indeed a part of parental duty to attend to the wants of a family and "provide things honest in the sight of all men.".—<HI>If any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</HI> This is the declaration of an inspired Apostle.— But what do ye more than an infidel, if, in providing for your children and servants, your care be confined to their bodies while their <HI>Souls</HI> are left to starve?—If your children ask bread will you thus give them a stone? Suffer, fathers, this boldness of speech:—if you condemn it I must appeal to a HIGHER TRIBUNAL.</P>
<P>Do you love your children? O then, as you regard your own happiness and theirs, guard them as the apple of your eye. While their minds are tender and open to every im∣pression, leave them not unguarded to receive their first im∣pressions from a corrupt heart and a degenerate world. Be assured, if you leave them uncontrouled to the government of their passions, and the almost irresistible influence of ill exam∣ple,—<HI>I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say,</HI>—they will soon come forth well versed in all the mysteries of iniqui∣ty. Then will they repay your fond indulgence, or rather cruel neglect, into your own bosoms. Will they render you the returns of filial obedience and sincere affection?—To obey is a lesson they were never taught. And as you never gave them any proofs of the affection of a parent; but on the contrary, "<HI>cruel like the Ostriches in the wilderness,</HI>" left them exposed to be trampled under foot by every passenger: you cannot expect that they will regard you with the warm affec∣tion of a son.—O ye parents, why will you thus wring out to yourselves the full cup of wormwood and gall?—Who
<PB N="21" REF="019547_0019_0FABF981D407CEC0"/>
hath bitterness?—Who hath woe?—Is it not he who hath a son that <HI>hearkeneth not to his father's instruction</HI> and <HI>despiseth his mother when she is old?</HI>—Is it not he who hath a son that being <HI>left to himself bringeth his mother to shame?</HI></P>
<P>But if you are not yet alarmed for your helpless offspring; and are yet to be convinced of the dangers attending child∣hood and youth; go into our streets and, if your hearts can endure, be witnesses for yourselves.—Behold on every side children unrestrained practising iniquity <HI>with greediness.</HI> Not only those vices which frequently attend meanness of birth and education, such as theft and lying; but also those, which arise from a total neglect of family government, mark the present rising generation. Your own observation must determine the justice of this remark. It is indeed painful to observe child∣ren through a want of early education, possessing nothing amiable or praise-worthy; but on the contrary, devoted to guilty passions, and chusing <HI>the way which leadeth to death.</HI> —They are malicious and revengeful and love contention. —But do they stop here?—Gladly for the honour of human nature and my Country would I now draw the veil. —But fidelity forbids.—Be astonished, O ye heavens, and give ear O earth! <HI>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in our land: and there are those who love to have it so.</HI> Children that have but just learned to speak are heard lisping forth horrid oaths and impious curses. They probably would not have known that there is a GOD; had they not been taught to trifle with his Name, that Name which is <HI>great and terrible, for it is holy.</HI> And equally ignorant would they have been with respect to a future world; had they not learned to curse their companions and, with impious boldness,
<Q>damn their souls to hell.</Q>
—But I tread on un∣hallowed ground.—I cannot proceed.— My soul shudders at the recollection of the horrid expressions of cursing and blasphemy, with which the virtuous ear is so often pained.—I dare not repeat them.—Should I attempt it, it would but renew your pain: and I fear, lest, like the "<HI>fretting leprosy,</HI>" its touch should leave me unclean. —</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="019547_0020_0FABF98857D184D8"/>Now, ye virtuous Parents, suffer me, while you are behold∣ing these scenes of wickedness, to bring before you your little families, helpless and exposed to this torrent of vice and im∣piety: They are looking to you alone for guidance and pro∣tection. Are you sure that you can protect them? Are there not numerous painful instances of — But why should I add to fears already insupportable?—Difficult indeed is a parent's duty. But can the difficulty so far dis∣courage you that you can relinquish your charge and leave them to certain infamy and ruin? <HI>Can a woman forget her sucking child?</HI> The more difficult the duty, the greater are the exertions necessary to discharge it with fidelity and success. But amidst all your exertions forget not that <HI>except the LORD keep your little city, you watch but in vain.</HI> Therefore, with humble importunity, wrestle with the GOD of Jacob, and let him not go until he bless you in your families.</P>
<P>And now, fathers and brethren, while you are instilling the principles of wisdom and virtue, and endeavouring to make your children such as will honour you in life and be blessings to Society, do not forget, I beseech you; that <HI>the FEAR of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and to depart from evil is understanding.</HI>—O teach them to fear that name which Angels adore, and at which devils tremble.—Tell them,—O tell them, and write it upon the palms of their hands, that they may never forget: THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS THAT TAKETH HIS NAME IN VAIN, Exodus 20.7.</P>
<P>But how long shall it be that the saying of the Prophet shall apply to us! <HI>Because of swearing the land mourneth.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. 23.10.</NOTE> O ye Guardians of our publick peace! Shall an insult of∣fered to an inferior magistrate not pass with impunity: and shall the barriers of virtue be broken down and the Throne of the KING OF KINGS be openly insulted; and they who are not to <HI>bear the sword in vain,</HI> be silent? Forbid it Virtue! Forbid it O MY COUNTRY!</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="019547_0021_0FABF989C3EEBAA8"/>But recollecting that <HI>the time is short,</HI> I close this address with but one consideration further.—<HI>It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the Judgment:</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Heb. 9.27.</NOTE> <HI>For the LORD himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of GOD.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. 4.16.</NOTE> Heaven, earth and hell are moved at his presence, and the sleeping dead awake to sleep no more.—Then, fathers, you with the children and servants committed to your care shall be summoned before the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST.— Solemn Tribunal!—All-important day!—If in this decisive trial you can make your appeal to HEAVEN:—Lo! Here am I and the children which thou hast given me: of those which thou gavest, none have perished through my in∣dulgence, or forgetfulness of thee;—unutterable will be your joy and great your reward.—<HI>Well done, thou good and faithful servant: enter thou into the joy of thy LORD.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>I would now with the warmest affection, address myself to the Younger part of the assembly.</P>
<P>My Young Friends,</P>
<P>To you the present scene speaks in striking language, teaching you the value of a parent's tender care.—Think not that crimes are peculiar to the <HI>complexion</HI> of the prisoner, and that ours is pure from these stains. Surely an idea so illibe∣ral and contracted cannot find a place in the breast of a gene∣rous youth.—Know, my brothers, that <HI>that</HI> casket, not∣withstanding its colour, contains an immortal soul, a Jewel of inestimable value; which, polished by divine grace, would shine in yonder world with a glorious lustre: while the Jewel in a brighter casket, being left in its natural state, would be <HI>blackness and darkness forever.</HI></P>
<P>There behold, my young brethren, the fate of one, who, with a mind not below the common level, has been left un∣restrained
<PB N="24" REF="019547_0022_0FABF98A39D05E88"/>
to the guidance of guilty passions and a corrupt heart.—Have you virtuous and affectionate parents who, with anxious concern, endeavour to instruct you in those principles which are necessary to secure you from in∣famy like this? Can you refuse them an unreserved obe∣dience and the returns of grateful affection?—Can you wish to add one pang to those which a parent's heart has already felt on your account?—Think, O heart-rending thought! think what would be their feelings, if they whom their souls love should for their over-much wickedness be made, as this unhappy criminal, a public spectacle of infamy and guilt!—Could there be any sorrow like unto this sorrow?—Spare, O spare a parent's aching heart and let there be no cause to look forward to a scene which cannot be borne even in thought.</P>
<P><HI>Hear,</HI> my brother, <HI>the instruction of thy father, and for∣sake not the law of thy mother: for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away: for they sleep not except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> Early chuse this path of wisdom, and your own experience will prove that the <HI>ways of wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and that all her paths are peace.</HI> Great indeed will be your peace when a dying Parent shall pronounce you an obedient and affectionate child; and those lips which had not instructed you in vain, shall close with commending you in the quivering accents of death, to that Being in whom <HI>the fatherless findeth mercy.</HI> May he hear and be well pleased with this last effort of parental love: and repay your respectful obedience and sincere affection into your own bosoms. And may GOD in his infinite goodness, grant, that when you shall take the places of your fathers, you may never have cause to feel the unutterable pangs of
<PB N="25" REF="019547_0023_0FABF98AF17266C8"/>
that parent's heart, who has a <HI>son that is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</HI></P>
<P>I would now turn my address to the whole Assembly.</P>
<P>Men and Brethren,</P>
<P>I beseech you, in the name of the LORD, to consider seri∣ously the things of which you are this day witnesses. We have here a striking evidence of the depravity of human nature; that we are indeed <HI>transgressors from the womb.</HI> We here see the natural productions of a heart uncultivated and left to itself; that indeed, it <HI>is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.</HI> At one view we now behold the consequences of the first apostacy, and the issue of actual trans∣gression. Surely <HI>the way of transgressors is hard:</HI> for <HI>he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.</HI> Let us there∣fore hear and fear and do no more wickedly. <HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. If thou do that which is evil be afraid</HI>; for ye see brethren <HI>that they bear not the sword in vain; for they are the Ministers of GOD, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</HI></P>
<P>Let us learn from what we now behold, that <HI>it is an evil and bitter thing to forsake the LORD our GOD.</HI> Doubtless the pity of every one present, is excited towards this criminal, thus in the beginning of life condemned to death, and now surrounded by the officers of justice, for execution. Indeed, that heart must be past feeling which can unmoved, be a witness to a scene like this. But, while we indulge a generous pity for a fellow-creature in distress, let us fear lest we fall into a worse condemnation, as criminals before the Tribunal of Heaven. For thus saith the faithful and true Witness; <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 3.18.</NOTE> Is this prisoner then condemned? So is the unbeliever.—Is she held in bonds
<PB N="26" REF="019547_0024_0FABF98BAF8AF5A0"/>
unto the time of execution? So is the unbeliever fast bound in the chains of sin and fettered by his guilty passions unto the final, dreadful day of execution: that day in which <HI>he that made him will not have mercy on him, and he that formed him will shew him no favour,</HI> Let us therefore brethren, <HI>take heed lest there be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living GOD. And when CHRIST who is</HI> the believer's <HI>life shall appear, then may we also appear with him in glory.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>After having devoted to the service of my Auditory so many of these, to the prisoner, <HI>all-important moments,</HI> I must now be indulged in addressing myself to her, in a few words with great plainness of speech.</P>
<P>To the Prisoner.</P>
<P><HI>Hannah,</HI> the time for you to die is come.—Yes; poor girl!—in about two hours, your eyes will be shut by death and you will not see the light of this sun again forever.— This is the last time that you will ever hear my voice from this place: for you are now going where I cannot see you; instruct you; or even pray for you.—You are going where you will find that those things which I have told you are true. —Yes, you will soon see that there is a great GOD who loveth goodness and good people; but <HI>is angry with the wicked every day,</HI> and will punish forever those whose sins are not pardoned before they die.—You will soon see that Saviour who came into this world to save sinners. You will one day stand before his Judgment-Seat, and if you do not, this day, truly repent of your wickedness and trust in him alone for mercy; he will pronounce against you a sentence infinitely more dreadful than that which has already been pronounced.—</P>
<P>You are now going to be hanged until you are dead: after that you will know, better than I can tell you, either the joys of Heaven, or the miseries—the miseries—O my soul!—the miseries of hell. Oh <HI>Hannah!</HI> repent of your
<PB N="27" REF="019547_0025_0FABF98E8EAF3760"/>
wickedness: this is the only time.—Be ashamed before GOD of your crimes.—Think how cruel you was, in not sparing the little girl, when she cried to you for mercy.— Don't you wish for mercy from GOD?—You have told me that you do.—If he is not more merciful than you, your soul cannot be saved. Remember, if he has mercy upon you, it will be from his own goodness; not from any good thing which he sees in you:—He sees nothing in you but wick∣edness,—a poor wicked creature covered with the innocent blood of a helpless child crying to you for mercy and you would shew no mercy.—<HI>Repent</HI> and <HI>believe</HI> in CHRIST, he is the only Saviour: if you are saved it will be for his sake alone. Pray earnestly to GOD that he would pity your ignorance and have mercy upon you for CHRIST's sake.— Think, <HI>Hannah,</HI> of what you have to do—hasten, or it will be too late—your time is short,—poor girl,—how much is to be done and how little time have you to do it in? —Your day is already far spent, and, O dreadful thought! the night of death is close at hand.—The guard, the officers of justice with all the dreadful attendants of your death, are now around you waiting for me to stop.—I must say no more.—Poor girl!—farewell.—May GOD in his abundant goodness give you repentance unto life, and have mercy on your soul. AMEN AND AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Public may wish to be informed more particularly respecting the criminal, <HI>Hannah Ocuish,</HI> than they have yet been: we have collected the following particulars, which it may not be improper to annex as an appendix to the preceding discourse.</P>
<P>She was born at <HI>Groton.</HI>—Early in life she discovered the malicious∣ness and cruelty of her disposition: as appears from the following fact, which was represented in evidence before the grand-jury. When about six years old, she with a brother about two years older than herself, meet∣ing a little girl at a distance from the neighbourhood, they endeavoured to get away her clothes and a gold necklace which she had on.—After beating the child until they had almost killed her, they stripped her, and disputing about the division of the clothes the child recovered, and getting away came home, covered with blood. This affair was immediately ex∣amined into, and the select-men of the town concluded to bind them both out.</P>
<P>Their mother, who is one of the <HI>Pequot</HI> tribe of indians, is an aban∣doned creature, much addicted to the vice of drunkenness.—She, it seems, not liking to have the girl bound out; brought her away and left her at a house, about three miles from the city of <HI>New-London,</HI> promising to return in a few days and take her away again. But she did not return 'till after several months, when urging the family to keep her longer they at length consented.—She continued in this family until she was appre∣hended for the crime, for which she was executed.</P>
<P>Her conduct, as appeared in evidence before the honorable Superior Court was marked with almost every thing bad. Theft and lying were her common vices. To these were added a maliciousness of disposition which made the children in the neighbourhood much afraid of her. She had a degree of artful cunning and sagacity beyond many of her years. —In short, her mind wanted to be properly instructed, and her disposition to be corrected.</P>
<P>We now come to the particulars of the horrid crime for which she suf∣fered.</P>
<P>On the 21st of July, 1786, at about 10 o'clock in the morning, the body of the murdered child was found in the public road leading from <HI>New-London</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="019547_0027_0FABF98F9366F6F8"/>
to <HI>Norwich,</HI> lying on its face near to a wall. Its head was covered with stones, and a number lay upon its back and arms. Upon examining the body the skull appeared to be fractured; the arms and face much bruis∣ed, and the prints of finger-nails were very deep on the throat.—The neighbourhood were immediately engaged in making search and enquiry for the murderer. The criminal made use of her usual art, to prevent suspicion.—She said that she saw four boys in her mistress's garden near where the child was found: that she called to them for being in the gar∣den and soon after heard the wall fall down. After searching and enquir∣ing for these boys to no effect, suspicions became strong that she was the guilty person. On the 22d, she was closely questioned, but repeatedly denied that she was guilty. She was then carried to the house where the body lay, and, being again charged with the crime, burst into tears and confessed that she killed her; saying if she could be forgiven she would never do so again. The particulars which she then gave, and which ap∣peared in the course of the trial were as follow.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 21st, she went to a brook which is near her mistress's house, to get a pail of water:—when at the brook, she saw the little girl come into the road, going to school. She immediately hastened home with the water, and setting it down at the door, ran across the gar∣den to overtake the child:—when near her, the criminal jumped over the wall and called to her: offering her a piece of calicoe which she then held in her hand. The child coming to her, she struck her on the head with a stone which she had taken up for the purpose, and repeating the blows the child cried out, <Q>Oh, if you keep beating me so I shall die.</Q> She continued the blows until the child lay still. But after a few moments, seeing that she stirred; she took her by the throat and choaked her 'till she was dead. Being asked why she laid stones upon the child. She said; it was to make people think that the wall fell upon her and killed her.— Upon being asked why she killed her: she said that she had intended giv∣ing her a whipping because she had complained of her in strawberry time (about five weeks before) for taking away her strawberries.</P>
<P>Such an instance of deliberate revenge and cruelty in one so young, has scarcely a parallel in any civilized country.</P>
<P>When the criminal was first committed to prison she appeared uneasy with her situation; but after a little time seemed to be quite contented and happy.—She would divert herself with the children that went to see her, and frequently would make very shrewd turns upon those persons who made severe remarks upon her.</P>
<P>When arraigned at the bar, she, at the direction of her council, plead "not guilty." During her trial she appeared entirely unconcerned.— After the verdict was brought in, and she was carried back to the prison; a person visited her and told her what must now be her punishment; and that she must prepare for death, and for another world: she seemed greatly affected, and continued in tears most of the day.—After this she seemed as unconcerned as before, and was very backward in conversing with the person who had thus alarmed her fears. It appeared that some persons had been there afterwards and encouraged her with telling her that she would not be hung.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="019547_0028_0FABF99089A02838"/>When she was brought to the bar to receive sentence of death, her stu∣pidity and unconcern astonished every one. While that benevolent ten∣derness which distinguishes his honor the Chief Justice, almost prevented utterance, and the spectators could not refrain from tears; the prisoner alone appeared scarcely to attend.</P>
<P>About a fortnight before her execution she appeared to realize her dan∣ger, and was more concerned for herself. She continued nearly in the same state until the Monday night before her execution: when she appeared greatly affected; saying, that she was distressed for her soul. She conti∣nued in tears most of Tuesday, and Wednesday which was the day of exe∣cution. At the place of execution she said very little—appeared greatly afraid, and seemed to want somebody to help her.—After a prayer a∣dapted to her unhappy situation, was offered to HEAVEN, she thanked the sheriff for his kindness to her, and then passed into that state which <HI>never</HI> ends.</P>
