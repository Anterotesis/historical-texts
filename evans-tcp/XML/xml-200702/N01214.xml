<P>IN Testimony of my humble Submission, due Reverence &amp; Gratitude to your Selves, I have transcribed this Sermon, Preached at the Execution of <HI>Josias</HI> and <HI>Joseph, Indians;</HI> On <HI>Octob.</HI> 12. 1709. It is matter of deep Sor∣row and Humiliation, that they should bring themselves to such an untimely Death. The Lord grant that both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> may be duely affected therewith, so as to labour after an exact Watchfulness against the Sin of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> which

They be∣haved themselves with a Solid and Grave Deportment, both in the Pub∣lick Assembly, and at the Place of Execution. <HI>Josias</HI> expressed him∣self to be willing to dye, and that he was not without some Hopes that God would Pardon him, and Save

<HEAD>The Woful Effects OF Drunkenness.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ISAIAH XXVIII. 1.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Wo to the crown of Pride, to the Drunkards of Ephraim, whose glo∣rious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the sat valleys of them that are overcome with Wine.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a Solemn Occasion, which we now meet together upon▪ Two Persons stand here be∣fore us, who are Condemn∣ed to suffer Death for that horrid Crime of Murder, which they have been Convicted of. The Lord
<PB N="2" REF="001452_0007_0FB2F2B636551690"/>
will have Execution done on Mur∣derers, <HI>Lev.</HI> 24. 17. No Satisfaction is to be taken for the Life of a Mur∣derer; He is guilty of Death; He shall surely be put to death: For the Land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the Blood of him that shed it, <HI>Numb.</HI> 35. 31, 33, 34. Now in order to the Retaining the gracious Presence of our holy God among us, the Land which we inhabit, ought to be clean∣sed from that defilement, which the Voluntary and Unjust taking away the Lives of men doth bring upon it.</P>
<P>The Honourable Judges of Her Majesties Superiour Court of Judi∣cature, have seen cause to direct me to Preach against the Sin of Drun∣kenness on this Occasion; because both the Murderers, and the Persons by them Murdered, were overtaken with Drink, when the acts of Mur∣der were perpetrated. The effect
<PB N="3" REF="001452_0008_0FB2F2B7C6BD5B68"/>
leads us to reflect upon the immedi∣ate cause and occasion thereof: and did we carefully avoid the leading occasions unto the Commission of Sin; there would not be such A∣bounding of gross Iniquities in the Land, as there is.</P>
<P>That it is no new thing for the Sin of Drunkenness to be followed with Murder; or at least with the Ruin and Destruction of the Drun∣kards themselves, and of others also by their means, may be plainly in∣ferred from the Text we have read unto you: Wherein we have an oc∣coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by way of Prediction and De∣nunciation, of the Ruin of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> (the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes) procured by the Abounding of this Sin of Drunkenness among them. That the Kingdom of <HI>Israel,</HI> as well as <HI>Judah,</HI> were addicted to this Vice of Drunkenness, is evident from such Scriptures which charge them with

it▪ As Hos. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 5. <HI>In the day of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Princes have made him sick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tties of Wine; He stretched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his hand with Scorners.</HI> Amos 6. 6. <HI>They drink wine in Bowls.</HI> And in this Chapter, Isa. 28. 7. <HI>But they also have erred through Wine, &amp; through strong Drink are out of the way,</HI> &amp;c. They befotted themselves with strong Drink, and thereby fell into many Errors and Miscarriages, both in things Civil and Religious. Igno∣rance, Errors &amp; Stupidity were the Companions and Consequents of that Sin. When a People are given up to Drunkenness, they become liable and prone to imbrace Super∣stition, Idolatry &amp; Errors. A false Religion will serve a Drunkards turn best; especially such a Profession, wherein he hopes he shall not be made uneasy, while he is wallowing in this Sin; by sharp Reproofs, se∣vere Discipline, or by the frowns of
<PB N="5" REF="001452_0010_0FB2F2BC383FC3D8"/>
those who are his Mates &amp; Fellows in the same Profession.</P>
<P>Now the Verse read, with the two following Verses, declare that the Ruin of that Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, was partly and very conside∣rably occasioned by the Prevailing of this Vice of Intemperance in Drinking among that People: This procured, that <HI>the glorious Beauty &amp; Greatness</HI> of this Crown (or King∣dom) of Pride, <HI>should be a fading flower:</HI> That is, should suddenly wither &amp; perish. These Drunkards who dwelt in <HI>Samaria</HI> (the Head-City of that Kingdom) as they suf∣fered themselves to be <HI>overcome, bro∣ken, over-thrown and knock down</HI> with Wine: So God prepared a mighty strong one, the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> which as a Tempest of Hail, and as a de∣stroying Storm, and as an over flow∣ing Flood of mighty Waters, should cast down and tread under foot, that glorious State &amp; Kingdom.</P>

<P>The Abounding of the Vice of Drunken∣ness among any People (especially among such a People as are the visi∣ble People of God, and do profess the true Religion) doth bring down from Heaven, dreadful Woes, and desolating Judgments upon them, as a Nation or Body of People, as well as Signal Punishment on Some par∣ticular Drunkards among them.</P>

<P>Here is in the Text, and Verses following, not only a Wo denounced against the Drunkards of <HI>Ephraim,</HI>

as a particular <HI>Rank and Sect of Sin∣ners</HI> in <HI>Ephraim,</HI> that were appointed to destruction; but also for their sakes, and on their account a Wo is denounced against the <HI>Crown;</HI> that is, the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ephraim;</HI> and against <HI>the Head;</HI> that is, the Metropolis of the Kingdom, in the Ruin whereof all other lesser Towns &amp; Villages circumjacent must needs suffer. The Vice of Drunkenness when it prevails and spreads among a People, brings down a destroying Tempest, a Storm, a mighty over∣flowing Flood of Divine Wrath and Vengeance, on a Professing People.</P>
<P>The Sixth Commandment, <HI>Thou shalt not Kill;</HI> Or, Thou shalt do no Murder; not only forbids the gross act of Murder, that is, The taking away our Own or our Neighbours Life unjustly, but also forbids what∣soever tendeth thereunto: There∣fore Drunkenness may properly be
<PB N="8" REF="001452_0013_0FB2F2C277B6FC38"/>
reckoned among the Sins forbidden in and by the Sixth Commandment; for it is a Transgression of that Com∣mand, in that it tends to the Taking away both of our <HI>present Welfare,</HI> Outward and Inward; and to the depriving us of happiness in a <HI>Future State;</HI> and that both <HI>Morally,</HI> as by the Sinfulness of it God is provoked to inflict punishment upon us, and <HI>Naturally and Physically</HI> also; as may be briefly hinted at in a few parti∣culars.</P>

Men may be ascribed to Intempe∣rance of Body, and the inordinate Passions of the Mind, which are Con∣comitants &amp; Consequents of Intem∣perance. How many Diseases do Drunkards bring upon themselves! How soon do they come to have their Natural force and strength a∣bated? to have a Pale, Lean and un∣healthy Countenance? Some of them to be constantly attended with a Cough; others with gouty Pains about them; or else with a constant gnawing at their Stomachs, which nothing can remove but Strong Drink! Some in a few years do so Extinguish the Natural Heat of their Blood, by adding an adventitious Heat thereto, that unless they often take down a Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, they can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t keep themselves Warm, but labour under such a Chillyness and Coldness, as unfits them for all business, and ren∣ders them dull and unactive. Some

loose the use of their Hands and Limbs, and come to be beholding to others to lift the Cup to their Mouths for them, having procured a penal Weakness upon themselves, for their Sinful &amp; Inordinate putting the Cup to their own Mouths.

a second drowning in the Water. Nor are these the first (who now stand in the midst of this great As∣sembly) who have committed Mur∣der, when overcome with Drink, and have been Executed for it.</P>

doleful and dismal: Then the Hus∣band is Exposed to Murder the Wife of his Bosom; and the Neighbour left to rise up and kill his Friend or Neighbour in the Field: So it was as to the cases of these Persons now condemned to dy. These Effects of following after strong Drink were spoken of by <HI>Solomon,</HI> in <HI>Proverbs</HI> 23. 29.—35. which you may read at your leisure.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By giving themselves over to Excessive Drinking multitudes do waste their Estates, &amp; bring wants, streights, and distressing Poverty on themselves, and their Families.</HI> Those who live in this Sinful course of Life, can't expect to be blessed in their Stores, in their labours, and in that which they set their hands unto; and with∣out Gods blessing we may not expect to be rich, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3. 16.

<P>Moreover, <HI>Drunkenness hath a Na∣tural tendency to Poverty.</HI> Those that follow after Strong Drink, <HI>have not the Art of getting or keeping Estates lawfully.</HI> They cannot be diligent in their Callings, nor careful to im∣prove all fitting Opportunities of providing for themselves, and for their Families: Nor are they pru∣dent in Saving what Estates they have in their Possession; they keep not their Expences within the bounds of their Income, but run themselves into debt, to satisfy their innordinate Appetites: thus their Idleness and Prodigality bring them to a Morsel of

Bread, &amp; do cloath them with Rags. Such are indisposed for the Exercise of diligence or discretion in ma∣naging their affayrs, being inclined to slothfulness, and all manner of Imprudencies.</P>
<P>Let me add, <HI>Such Persons do not properly enjoy what they have in their Possession:</HI> in that, they take not such Contentment (as they might) in their Outward Comforts: They are Envyous at the Prosperity of Others; the little which they have is not at∣tended with that blessing, of a satis∣fyed and contented Mind. Also <HI>such Persons</HI> having given over the lawful Methods of gaining Estates, and maintaining themselves, &amp; their Families, by industry &amp; prudence, <HI>are tempted to use shifting, sharking, frau∣dulent ways of dealing,</HI> by which dis∣honest courses they bring a further Guilt on themselves, &amp; ripen them∣selves for Ruin, and mean time be∣come
<PB N="16" REF="001452_0021_0FB2F2DA38DC55E0"/>
odious, distastful, burdensome, vexatious and troublesome to their Neighbours. This consideration leads us to another particular:</P>
<P>Namely,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Drunkenness deprives Men of all Honour and Esteem among good Men;</HI> Whereby they might become accep∣table and useful to others in their Generation.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Internal Welfare of Men; the Health and Prosperity of their Souls is obstructed, and in Multitudes

out the comfort which otherwise they might find in their Outward comforts. For want of Inward Peace, they have nothing to support them under the Afflictions of this Life, nor have they rational grounds to expect a better condition here∣after.

<HI>Isa.</HI> 28. 7. They cannot find out nor walk in the narrow path which leads to Glory. This Sin lays men open, &amp; inclines them to all manner of other Sins, whereby they quickly fill up the measure of their Sins, and ripen themselves for eternal Damna∣tion. This Sin disposes men to much ungodliness, &amp; ushers in much wickedness. It inclines men to fil∣thy Lusts, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23. 33. To perverse and unclean discourse, and to become Scorners of all Goodness, and good Men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 69. 12. <HI>Hos.</HI> 7. 12. Men are hereby let loose to all those Sins to which they are either by Nature or Custom inclined; or to which Temptations and Opportunities for their Commission, do lead them. Drunkards are threatned expressly with Exclusion out of the Kingdom of Heaven, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 9. And they ought to be excluded out of the So∣cieties of the Godly, from the Com∣munion
<PB N="23" REF="001452_0028_0FB2F2EC49767858"/>
of Saints on Earth, (which is the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth) 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3 11. As a Token of their Exclusion out of the Church Triumphant; unless they repent and reform. But alas, how rare a thing is it for any to be recovered from this Sin, when once they have been accustomed and enslaved there-un∣to. And Oh! what inexpressible Stings will they have at last, who for their indulging themselves in this Vice are banish'd from the gracious presence of God for ever, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23. 32.</P>
<P>Nextly, We should proceed to <HI>Consider the Woes and Ruin brought upon Societies of Men, upon Towns, Churches, States and Kingdoms, by the prevailing of Drunkenness among them.</HI> GOD <HI>sends many s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Judgments</HI> on a People that addict themselves to Intemperance in Drinking. God is provoked hereby sometimes to send
<PB N="24" REF="001452_0029_0FB2F2EFF2E32150"/>
a <HI>Famine</HI> on a Land, and to cut short the fruits of the Earth, <HI>Joel</HI> 1. 5. Sometimes God sends <HI>War</HI> on a People, to punish them for this Sin. The King of <HI>Assyria</HI> was sent of God to destroy the Crown (or King∣dom of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> because this Vice reigned among them; as appears from our Text, and the following Verses. Sinful &amp; Excessive Drink∣ing seems to have been One of the prevailing Sins of the Old World, which brought <HI>a Deluge of Waters</HI> on the whole World, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. 38, 39. <HI>They were eating and drinking, until the flood came and took them all away.</HI></P>
<P>When Church-Members and Pro∣fessors of Religion indulge them∣selves in this Vice, it brings a Woful Blemish not only upon themselves, but upon the Christian Society whereto they belong; it proves a stumbling-block to others; an ob∣struction to the Propagation of Re∣ligion;
<PB N="25" REF="001452_0030_0FB2F2F16F273E48"/>
and keeps many from a Love and likeing of the Christian Religi∣on, and of Church Order and Ordi∣nances.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Drunkenness hath a natu∣ral Tendency to bring Confusion and Disorder into all Societies that are infected with it. Little or no∣thing of Religion or good Order is, or can be upheld in the Families of Drunkards. The Morning and E∣vening Sacrifice of Family-Prayer is miserably neglected in such Fami∣lies: and where the Heads of Fami∣lies are Intemperate, Disorderly and Bruitish; there the Children and Servants are brought up in Igno∣rance and Impudence; in Idleness, Lewdness and Profaneness. When Drunkenness becomes a prevailing Sin in a Land, it will soon Extinguish Religion and Order. When the Drinking party is so potent as to prevail over the small Number of
<PB N="26" REF="001452_0031_0FB2F2F3139DD5D8"/>
Sober Men, that are the Remnant of Gods People in the Land, then none shall be improved in Offices of trust but such as Wink at, favour and countenance this Vice; and then the common interest of a People will soon be incommoded &amp; ruined. Nothing doth more unqualify Per∣sons for Offices of Trust, than this Vice of Drunkenness; no Vice makes men betray their trust more than this doth. And when such are put upon Service and Employment of any considerable concern and mo∣ment, they quickly disgrace them∣selves therein, and spoil the work they take in hand; and so disgrace the Offices they bear, that those Of∣fices become contemptible and de∣spicable, because such men have sus∣tained them; which are justly e∣steem'd Stations of Honour &amp; Digni∣ty, when Sober Men discharge them.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> The Martial Spirits of a
<PB N="27" REF="001452_0032_0FB2F2F53B0F1460"/>
Nation or People are abated and e∣nervated by the prevalency of Drun∣kenness; so that Courage, Magna∣mity &amp; Conduct, Vivacity of Mind, and Activity of Body, and Ability to encounter Hardships▪ are wanting when they have most occasion for them; which incourages their Ene∣mies to assault them as a weak and naked People. Yea, we read of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> that when he heard the <HI>Persians</HI> were great Drinkers, he would not make War upon them: Saying, That alone would Ruin them.</P>

by <HI>themselves;</HI> they neglect the duties which every Man owes to himself; they are justly styled their own worst Enemies; and they soon fall into dishonest and unjust deal∣ings with others.

<P>Indeed it seems almost in vain to undertake to convince those of the great Evil they are guilty of, in be∣ing instrumental to the Drunkenness of others, by supplying them with the Fuel whereby the flame of their craving Appetites is not quenched, but increased: who are ready to re∣pel the force of all Arguments used for their conviction, with that an∣swer, <HI>By this craft we gain our Wealth.</HI> But whether men will hear or not, we must be faithful in bearing a Testimony against them; who con∣trary to the wholesome Laws of this Province, for the sake of a little gain, supply the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> the Abori∣ginal Natives of this Land, with such

quantities of Strong Liquors, where∣by they are often intoxicated, and thereby exposed to many dangers and mischiefs; even to the wound∣ing, bruising, killing and destroying one of the other.

We are not ignorant of their natural extraordi∣nary craving Appetite after Strong Drink: We are not ignorant that most of them are very unmeet judges to determine when they have drank enough.

Child is no competent judge of what is best, and most convenient for it self: by the same reason we should watch over grown Persons, and be as helpful as we can, to prevent them from harming themselves with Strong Drink; when we know by our observation of them from time to time, that their Reason hath not the Command of their Appetites. Let's consider, these <HI>Indians</HI> are of the same Race of Mankind with our selves; they are our Brethren by <HI>Adam</HI> our common Father; and by <HI>Noah,</HI> the Father of the Postdiluvian World: yea, they are our Friends and Fellow-Subjects under the same Crown.
