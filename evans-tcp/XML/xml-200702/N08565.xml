</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE preceeding part of the chapter gives us the narration of the con∣demnation and crucifixion of our blessed Saviour.—This was a glori∣ous event to an apostate world; herein an effectual foundation was laid for the recovery of apostate man to the image and favour of God, and the bliss and immortality for which he was at first design'd; howbeit his cru∣cifiers meant not so. I shall omit taking notice of the many circumstances here made mention of, that relate to our Lord's crucifixion, save only what is necessary in order to place the words of our text in their proper point of light.</P>
<P>It appears then, from the Evangelist's account, that, agreable to what was spoken in prophesy by Isaiah, chapter 53. last verse—he was in his death "numbered with the transgressors": For two malefactors, who were under sentence of death, adjudg'd to the painful and ignominious death of
<PB N="6" REF="010952_0004_0F85305090938BA8"/>
the cross, the same death that our Saviour was ad∣judg'd to, were led away with him to the place of execution, and all three to be nailed to the cross and die together. "And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they cru∣cified him, and the malefactors; one on the right hand, and the other on the left".</P>
<P>What a dreadful, distress'd situation was our blessed Lord in at this time! But were there any relentings towards him in the men that stood a∣bout him? Any pity and compassion shewn to him? No, He was mocked and derided and insult∣ed in the most cruel and shameful manner, by the people and the rulers at the head of them—as you may see ver. 35. and onwards. Notice is taken in the 40th ver. that one of the malefactors railed on him, in like manner, as others had done. But in Matthew and Mark, it is expresly said, that <HI>both</HI> of them did so.—"The theives also which were cru∣cified with him cast the same in his teeth", says <HI>Matthew,</HI> chap. 27.44. referring to what the scribes and elders had insolently demanded of him, that he would come down from the cross, &amp;c. In <HI>Mark</HI> it is, "<HI>They</HI> that were crucified with him, reviled him".</P>
<P>It is plain from what both these Evangelists de∣clare, that both these malefactors treated our Lord in the same manner, at the time of his crucifixion. The reason why the Evangelist Luke mentions only one of them, railing on him, was doubtless because one of them ceased railing at him, before he ex∣pired, a sudden and extraordinary change having
<PB N="7" REF="010952_0005_0F8530510E287B30"/>
passed upon him, so that he had other apprehen∣sions of Christ from what he had when he came to the place and was first fastned to the cross, and was very differently affected towards him. None of the other Evangelists relate what Luke does respecting these things. One of the malefactors kept on rail∣ing to the last: But the other, who had just before joined with him, by a wonderful, divine influence upon his heart, suddenly chang'd his note, thinks and speaks in a very different strain.</P>
<P><Q>Here were so many evidences given in a short time of a blessed change wrought in him, as that more could not have been given in so little a compass.</Q>
He that had just before railed at Jesus, now administers a serious and pungent re∣proof to his fellow—"Dost not thou fear God, see∣ing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiss".— What must this rebuke be owing to, but the sud∣den and extraordinary change that passed over him? It seems very plain from the Evangelist's account, that <HI>He,</HI> equally with his companion, was a sinner when he came to the place of execution. Both of them had lived in abominable practices, particu∣larly in a course of theft, so that they had forfeited their lives into the hands of public justice, and for the public safety were condemned to die, to be drove out of the world, as not fit to live any longer in it, such pests and nusances had they been to the community. And the day of execution comes, and both go to it, hardned and impenitent, having no fear of God in their hearts and before their eyes, pre∣judic'd
<PB N="8" REF="010952_0006_0F8530576B5FAB10"/>
against Christ, who was to be crucified with them, and reviling and reproaching him. But one of them at the eleventh hour was wrought upon by the power of divine grace—as appears from what he said to his companion in iniquity and in suffer∣ing: And so also from the prayer he addressed to our Saviour in our text. "And he said unto Jesus, Lord remember me", &amp;c. And from the answer, that Jesus immediately gave to him, "Ve∣rily I say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with me in paradise".</P>
<P><Q>This (as one notes) is the prayer of a dying sinner to a dying Saviour.—Perhaps he never prayed before, and yet now was heard and saved at the last gasp. While there is life, there is hope; and while there is hope, there is room for prayer.</Q></P>
<P>There are several things worthy our considera∣tion, from this dying prayer of this malefactor, and our Saviour's answer to it. These I shall but briefly speak to, that I may leave more room for that which is the more especial design of our being assembled at this time, in this house of worship, up∣on so very melancholy and affecting an occasion.</P>
<P>Here then, we may, in the first place, consider, wherefore it was that this dying criminal, who came to the place of execution in a state of sin and im∣penitence, did, before he expired, address this pray∣er to Christ, "Lord remember me", &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now it must needs be, that by his thus praying to Christ, he was brought truly to believe in him,
<PB N="9" REF="010952_0007_0F8530581F9FA848"/>
as the Son of God and the Saviour of sinners, and as able to save such a sinner as he was, though he had gone on even to the last, impenitent and at enmity with him. How can it be otherwise, than that he who had just before been a railer, and became all at once a humble suppliant, paying an act of re∣ligious homage to Christ, and in a matter so interest∣ing to himself; how, I say, can it be otherwise, but that he should have such a faith as this, and in a lively exercise too? Had it not been for this, is it not likely that he would have gone on railing with his companion to the last, instead of rebuking him? It must needs be that he had a very different view and apprehension of Christ from what he just be∣fore had, and was differently affected towards him. It had been insolently and tauntingly demanded of him, by the chief priests, rulers, elders and people, that if he were the Son of God, he would come down from the cross, save himself from the death they were now putting him to, and save the two thieves also, and so give proof of such his relation to God. They treated his claim to this relation with contempt, upbraiding him, that he was not able to come down from the cross, to deliver himself, or the thieves; and so that it was a meer pretence that he was the Son of God, and the true Messiah, and "the thieves", both of them, "cast the same in his teeth". But he who offered the prayer to him in our text, was at the last brought to believe, that though he did not come down from the cross, as it had been demanded of him, but submitted to the death of it, yet he was indeed what he had declared himself to be, the Son of God and the anointed Sa∣viour; to see and believe the necessity of his dying
<PB N="10" REF="010952_0008_0F853059A441D858"/>
this death, that so he might to all intents and pur∣poses become the Saviour of sinners.</P>
<P>The death of Christ upon the cross is a main and principal article in the gospel-scheme of redemption. This is spoken of, especially in the writings of the new-testament, as a sacrifice; a sacrifice of atone∣ment. Divers things spoken by our Saviour him∣self express this, as might be particularly shown; and the epistles of the Apostles are abundant in ex∣pressing the same thing, especially the epistle to the Hebrews. The blood of Christ is represented as "precious blood", incomparably more so, than such "corruptible things as silver and gold", as that "through which we have redemption, even the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of God's grace". "It cleanseth from all sin". By the application of this blood, the most heinous and aggravated sins, those that have been of a scarlet and crimson colour, may be washed away, and the guilty sinner become as white as the snow and as the wool. And what is it now that renders the blood of Christ so efficacious? I answer, because it is the blood of him, who though he took upon him the human nature, and in that nature died the death of the cross, yet was truly the Son of God; a higher character than his being the son of man; denoting a sameness of nature with the Father.</P>
<P>Jesus, whom the Jews with wicked hands cruci∣fied and slew, was the "Lord of glory"; a cha∣racter entirely incompatible with any finite nature whatever, though of the highest rank and dignity. Now the divine character of Christ, his being the
<PB N="11" REF="010952_0009_0F85305A251F6330"/>
Son of God, in a higher and more exalted sense, than saints and angels, who are sometimes so called; this is that, which derives an infinite virtue and efficacy into his blood which he shed upon the cross. So that it is justly said of him, that he is "mighty to save", "able to save to the utter∣most", &amp;c.</P>
<P>So that the faith of the dying thief, respected Christ, (as was said before) as the Son of God and the anointed Saviour; and so that the death he was now dying, was a sacrifice to put away sin, to make a compleat satisfaction to the justice of God for it; that he himself, notwithstanding his heinous wicked∣ness, and abusive treatment of the suffering Saviour, even until that time, might, through the virtue there∣of, be pardoned, justified and saved; and his trust and dependance was firmly placed in him according∣ly. And now sin, which he had been so deeply guilty of before God, appears to him in its vileness and malignity. He is not exempted from the capital punishment he is adjudg'd to; the sentence of death passed upon him could not legally be reversed: But this is not the main thing with him, he is more affected with his wickedness which had brought him to this capital punishment; the vileness of which, principally as against God, is what he is now led to grieve and mourn for after a godly sort. He was doubtless now in the exercise of a true repen∣tance towards God, as well as faith unfeigned to∣wards the Lord Jesus Christ. And so from a vile, hardned sinner, he suddenly became a justified and sanctified man; and could with a humble confi∣dence make the prayer to Christ that he did, that
<PB N="12" REF="010952_0010_0F85305AD3788328"/>
he would "remember him, when he came into his kingdom".</P>
<P>This sudden and happy change in him, just be∣fore he expir'd, contrary to all his inward enmity, hardness and prejudice against Christ, was (as was hinted before) effected in him by the gracious and powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ, which is the Spirit of the living God, to whom nothing is impossible; who has an immediate access to the souls of men, and contrary to all improbabilities, can in his adorable sovereignty work in them to will and to do of his own good pleasure. This poor, dy∣ing criminal, becoming at last a true penitent and a sound believer, thereupon entertains a lively hope, that he should be happy in that invisible state into which he was now passing, and accordingly he makes the prayer of faith to Jesus—"Lord remember me", &amp;c.</P>
<P>And so I go on in the next place, to consider the import of the prayer itself.</P>
<P>It is plain from this prayer, that he believ'd that though Jesus was condemned and crucified as a malefactor, yet that he was the "Holy One of God", owned and accepted of his Father, and that when he expir'd he would ascend to the heavenly king∣dom. And he now fervently prays to him, that when he came there he would remember him, that he would admit him to be with him in that king∣dom, admit him in his spirit thereinto, when it should leave his body, as presently it would do; much such a prayer as that of the excellent martyr Stephen to the exalted Jesus, whom he had an ami∣able and happy vision of, through the opened hea∣vens—"Lord
<PB N="13" REF="010952_0011_0F85305B99F3A188"/>
Jesus receive my spirit", Acts 7.59. He was fully convinc'd that his soul would live after his body was dead, and that it would at once enter upon an invisible state. And the general purport of his prayer is—Lord, may my soul be happy in that state, may it be admitted to the glories of thy kingdom, "remember me and prepare a place for me" when thou comest into it. He does not go into any particulars, he sums up all in this, "Lord remember me", sensible that if he did so, it would be enough, that he should then be as happy as he could desire. But without enlarging here, I go on,</P>
<P>In the next place, to consider the gracious ans∣wer of Jesus to this dying prayer of this poor criminal, "Verily I say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with me in paradise".</P>
<P>He speaks here of heaven under the name of "paradise", and it is divers times thus spoken of in the new-testament, in allusion to the antient gar∣den of God, that seat of innocence, joy and felicity to our first parents.</P>
<P>Our Lord had himself an undoubted prospect of his human soul's ascending immediately to the hea∣venly paradise, so soon as it should leave his body.
<Q>That (as one notes) was the beginning of the joy that was set before him:</Q>
And hence, "He en∣dur'd the cross, despising the shame of it". The malefactor believed this of him: And accordingly he prays, Lord when thou arrivest at paradise, re∣member me.—The answer he gave was kind and gracious. He did not upbraid him with his past heinous wickedness, and particularly with his abuse
<PB N="14" REF="010952_0012_0F85305C84C509F0"/>
of himself in reviling him, as he had just before done; did not tell him, no—I will reject you, as you deserve; you shall have no lot or portion in that blessed place, where I am going—you shall be a monument of my everlasting wrath in the hell of the damned; but knowing his faith was genuine, and his repentance sincere, though late; he gives him a most comfortable and reviving answer, "to day shalt thou be with me in paradise". He speaks peremptorily in the case, as that which he might certainly depend upon, "<HI>Verily,</HI> I say unto thee", &amp;c. "I the Amen, the faithful witness, say unto thee", &amp;c. "I say Amen to this prayer, put my <HI>fiat</HI> to it". It is observable here, that though our Lord was now dying the death of the cross "thro' weakness", yet he speaks to this malefactor, as one having authority—I have power to grant your re∣quest, and you may depend upon it, that I will do so. Your departing spirit shall immediately, even this day, be with me, where I am my self going, even in the paradise of God above. And so this poor dying criminal, who had run a sad race, ventur'd upon the very borders of eternal destructi∣on, yet being at the last cast, visited with the gra∣cious and powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ, as was observed before, had, from this answer to his prayer, even as his suffering Saviour had, "a joy set before him", a certain prospect of go∣ing immediately to a state of compleat blessedness in the heaven of heavens. And this we may well suppose, made him, as it were, insensible to the ex∣cruciating pains and tortures of his body, which was fastned to the ignominious, accursed tree, nor can he find it in his heart to ask or wish to be taken
<PB N="15" REF="010952_0013_0F85305D192A1BB0"/>
down from it and discharged; but his soul must rather earnestly aspire after and passionately wish to go to the possession of that glorious, exalted happi∣ness, his Saviour had now promised him, and that immediately, even that very day. This was infi∣nitely more desirable than to be discharged from the cross, return to the world, be in a state of ease, credit and reputation among men, yea than to be put into the possession of all the splendor and magnificence it can afford. To have the promise of Christ fulfilled to him, of going to be with him in paradise, this was by far the best of all. Nothing further is re∣corded of him; but we may be well assured, that this great and precious promise of Christ was verified to him—that that very day, he had a joyful, blessed meeting with his Saviour in the heavenly paradise, that he met with a hearty welcome by him there∣into, that he was congratulated upon his arrival by all the shining ranks of angels and archangels, and filled with the highest praises and adorations for the rich and abundant grace of the crucified Jesus, in snatching him as a brand out of the burning, and raising him to so high honour, dignity and felici∣ty, as to receive him to be with him and to fix him in those heavenly mansions, when he might have justly left him in his impenitence and unbe∣lief, and to sink irrecoverably into the regions of eternal death and despair, as was the case with his poor wicked companion, who, it is probable, kept on to the last gasp, railing and reviling.</P>
<P>Thus I have, with all convenient brevity, con∣sidered the most material things in the dying prayer of the malefactor in our text, and our Lord's
<PB N="16" REF="010952_0014_0F85305DD96C3978"/>
answer to it.—I shall now offer a few remarks briefly upon what has been said.</P>
<P>First, We may hence see, what it is that the heavenly happiness, into which the souls of the faith∣ful do immediately pass at death, eminently consists in, viz.—their going to be with Christ.</P>
<P>This we may gather from his answer to the dying prayer of the criminal—"This day thou shalt be with me", &amp;c. You shall be ad∣mitted to the heavenly paradise, to be with me there—that shall be your happiness, and that will be sufficient. So it was in the estimation of that eminent servant of Christ, the apostle Paul, "I desire to depart and be with Christ". Phil. 1.23.— Being with Christ is comprehensive of every thing great and good—a total freedom from all sin, sor∣row, temptation; a being fixed in a state of un∣disturbed rest and tranquility, raised to a perfecti∣on of holiness and rejoicing with joy unspeakable and full of glory, in the clear shinings of his countenance, and in the divinest tokens and manifestations of the love of this transcendant∣ly amiable and excellent person: And all this to last through a boundless eternity. O what a sublime and glorious happiness is it for souls at death to go to be with the Lord Jesus Christ! When they are absent from the body, to go to be present with the Lord! Verily, in this case, the day of death, let it come in what shape or form it will, is better than the day of their birth, for it proves a sure passage to the highest possible feli∣city, as that of being with the blessed Jesus is.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010952_0015_0F85305E8F94B560"/>Secondly, From the prayer of this criminal, and the answer of Christ to it, we may be led to re∣mark, the divinity of his person.</P>
<P>The criminal had a further view of him, than the <HI>man</HI> Christ Jesus, bleeding and suffering upon the cross; a view of him as the glorious Son of God—accordingly addresses a servent and most in∣teresting prayer to him, pays him divine homage.— The dying Saviour does not rebuke him for this, as offering such homage to a meer creature; but attends to it with satisfaction and pleasure, gives a reviving answer, and lets him fully know and be assured of it, that he had full power to grant him his petition and request. But this would not have been, had he not a higher and more excellent na∣ture, than meerly the human.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This instance of the dying criminal, his believing and repenting at the last, and being there∣upon admitted to be with Christ in the heavenly paradise, is far from affording sufficient grounds to sinners, to persist in a course of wickedness, pre∣suming upon it that at last they shall truly repent, obtain an interest in the redemption by Christ, and on the whole, eternal salvation in heaven.</P>
<P>It is certain, that those who go on thoughtless and impenitent in wickedness, are daily provoking the divine majesty—treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath: The wrath of God is swiftly pursuing them, and they are daily in danger of its overtaking them, and then they are irrecoverably lost and miserable. But if God should continue them in life even to old age, as they are daily affront∣ing and dishonouring him, so he may be provoked
<PB N="18" REF="010952_0016_0F85305F5682C970"/>
wholly to take his Holy Spirit from them, to give them up to hardness and blindness, to their own heart's lusts, and to walk in their own counsels; and the event of all will be their "everlasting de∣struction from God's presence, and the glory of his power". For in this case, it is impossible, that they should ever be brought to true repentance towards God, and faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ, and so finally obtain salvation. So that if any take encouragement from this example of the dying malefactor, whose case we have been considering, to go on impenitent in sin, yea habitually allowing themselves in any one known sin, presuming upon it, that all will be well with them at last, they run a desperate venture, they are in the most iminent danger of perishing eternally. Let all who have hitherto gone on impenitent in wickedness, seriously think of these things in time, and no longer harden themselves against God. Let them attend to the call of God, to day while it is called to day, to re∣pent and turn to him, that they may live and not die; let them fly to the Lord Jesus Christ, that they may be cleansed and purified, and made par∣takers of his purchased redemption.</P>
<P>Fourthly, From what we have heard of the case of the dying malefactor in our text, we may learn, that it is a thing at least possible, that impenitent sinners who have gone on such to the last, may be effectually brought home to God and Christ, and obtain eternal salvation.</P>
<P>Upon various accounts, the thing is very impro∣bable, and what may not be presumed upon by any, as was just said. However we see, from the example
<PB N="19" REF="010952_0017_0F8530600F0FB680"/>
we have been considering, that this has in fact been the case: And what has been, may be again. For there is nothing impossible with God, that does not imply in it, a repugnancy to his nature and ador∣able perfections. Here we see a very signal display of the riches of divine grace to a poor hardned sin∣ner, that had gone on in enmity against God and Christ, even to his dying hours. So that, though the circumstances of this dying malefactor were different from those of gospel-impenitents now, as I might show, would the time allow, yet, from what happened to him, thus much may be gathered, that impenitent sinners, even at the last, are not wholly excluded from hope. By the powerful and graci∣ous influences of the Spirit of Christ, they may be brought, even at the last, to look to Jesus the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world; to look to him with an eye of faith, as the all-sufficient Saviour, whose precious blood has virtue sufficient in it to cleanse from all sin; to look to him and mourn, and be in bitterness of soul, and to commit the poor, perishing and departing soul into his hands, persuaded that he will keep what is com∣mitted to him. Such may be the case, I say. So that none, even in the near views of death and eter∣nity, may totally despair of being saved.
<Q>The dying thief upon the cross (as one speaks) for∣bids thee to despair utterly, though thou hast run a terrible risque, and ventured on the borders of destruction; and if thou art saved at last, it is so as by fire, it is like a brand pluck'd out of the burning, or as a man escaping naked out of the flames, and passing on the very brink of hell into everlasting life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010952_0018_0F8530610F50E218"/>This that I have now said, is especially applicable to you, poor <HI>Arthur!</HI> a prisoner of death, and this very day to be cut off by the sword of civil justice! O what a gloomy, melancholy day is this, to see you in this unhappy situation! cut short in the prime of life! oblig'd to flee to the pit, and no man to stay you! The sentence of death passed upon you cannot be recall'd!—The fatal tree is erected!—The officers of justice surround you! and all things are made ready to carry the sentence into execution! and before the sun closes upon us this evening you will launch into an awful eternity, and go to appear at the tremendous bar of God, to give up an account of your conduct in the body. And your eternal state will this very day be fix'd and unalterable! At these things doth not your heart tremble, and is it not moved out of its place? Death is an awful change at any time, and in any form, though to righteous ones a blessed day, their glorious birth-day into immortal life; but a dreadful day to the wicked and ungodly: For they enter at once upon a state of endless mi∣series and torments with the devil and his angels.— Methinks, it is impossible that you should meet death, especially in such an ignominious form, with carelessness and indifference, but that your soul must be filled with anxiety and distress at the near pros∣pect of it, and at what will follow. But as terrible as the death before you may seem to be, yet it is nothing to the second, the eternal death that will follow to the wicked and ungodly.—But now, this temporal death that you must in a few hours die, may prove gain to you, and will do so, if you are, as was the poor malefactor who suffered with our
<PB N="21" REF="010952_0019_0F8530619C154CF0"/>
Saviour, a true believer in him, a sincere penitent. In this case your departing soul shall, as his did, im∣mediately upon its leaving the body, go to be with Christ in the paradise above.</P>
<P>Since now, there is a necessity of your dying this day, O of what infinite importance is it to you, that you die in a state of favour with God, interested in the merits of the all-sufficient Redeemer, and possessed of that holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord! And is it so, that you are in∣deed in such a happy state as this? If so, you need not be afraid of dying, though a shameful death. You may meet it with courage, because it will prove a sure passage to the glorious presence of Christ in paradise.</P>
<P>What I now say, is not with a design to flatter you, as though your state God-ward was certainly good, and so that you might be sure of salvation. I only propose this matter to your own heart and conscience, whether that tells you, that the case stands thus with you, or the contrary? See now, what answers your conscience makes to the questions I shall propose to you.—</P>
<P>Have you been led to see what an infinite evil sin is, not meerly because of the punishment temporal or eternal that follows upon it, but principally as it is against God? A vile dishonour and affront offer∣ed to his glorious majesty, whom all reasonable be∣ings in all worlds ought to honour and obey? And as it is most base and shameful ingratitude to him who made you, who has upheld you in life, and bestowed so many mercies upon you, and who has given his dearly beloved Son to redeem you by his

precious blood? For in this consists the great evil of sin, viz. <HI>that it is against God.</HI> And have you a hearty grief and sorrow for it, mainly on this ac∣count, penitently acknowledging to God with David, "against <HI>Thee, Thee</HI> only have I sinned"? Psal. 51.4. Does sin appear vile and odious to you for its own sake? And what your soul desires above every thing to be freed from? Have you such a thorough sense of the vileness of it, as that if you could be set at liberty, and escape the capital punishment you are sentenc'd to, you could never find it in your heart any more to indulge yourself in any one known sin? Have you good reason to think that you should no more return to foolishness; but that it would be the main business of your life to serve and honour God? Attend carefully to the answers, your own conscience gives to these questions.—</P>
<P>Again, Do you justify man in the punishment you are sentenced to? Have you no risings of heart, no ill-will to the honourable Court or the Jury, before whom you were tried, convicted and condemned? And as to the person that accused you, that you do not harbour any malice towards her? And even supposing you think you was un∣fairly and injuriously treated in the matter, yet do you find a disposition freely and heartily to forgive her?—Such a disposition as this, however con∣trary to corrupt nature, the gospel of Christ makes absolutely necessary, even in cases of the greatest in∣juries, as persons would hope to obtain forgiveness of God themselves.</P>
<P>Again, I would ask you, what sense you have of your deserts at the hands of God? Have you such
<PB N="23" REF="010952_0021_0F8530630DD219E8"/>
a sense of your guilt, as to see, that you have for∣feited all mercy from him, that he might justly cast you off, and make you a monument of his eternal wrath, and this, though you could shed an ocean of tears, sensible, that this would make no atonement to his justice for the least of your sins? And are you truly sensible, that if you are saved, it will be contrary to your deserts, that it will be owing solely to the free, rich, and sovereign mercy of God through Jesus Christ?—Therefore do you see your need of Christ, that mercy can't be extended to you, but only for his sake, who by shedding his blood up∣on the cross, has made a full satisfaction to the justice of God on the behalf of sinners, and opened an effec∣tual way for their obtaining an acquittal from guilt, a free and full pardon at the hands of God, a recep∣tion to his favour now, and to eternal life hereafter? Do you truly believe the record that God has given in his word, with respect to the blood of Christ, the incomparable preciousness of it, that it can cleanse from all sin, and particularly your sins however nu∣merous and heinous? and do you heartily trust in it accordingly? Is the blood of Christ, the main, principal ground of your hope? Are you yourself nothing, and is Christ all?</P>
<P>These are very solemn and important questions.— O how happy must it be, if you can answer them to the satisfaction of your own heart, and can at the same time appeal, with a humble holy confidence, to that God, who is greater than the heart and know∣eth all things!</P>
<P>But now, on the other hand, what a sad thing is it, if you have not such a sense of things, and such
<PB N="24" REF="010952_0022_0F853063DA33AFF8"/>
a disposition as has now been said! O sad and de∣plorable case, if, now that you are brought to the very borders of the eternal world, you have not truly repented and believed in Christ, and made your peace with God! But a few sands more in your glass, and a solemn account soon to be given up! Must you die impenitent and unbelieving, and suffer the second death, which is eternal? Are you under a fatal necessity of all this? Blessed be God, no!— While there is life there is hope. And behold! even now at last, I bring you glad tidings of good things.—You may yet be a subject of the pardoning mercy of God, and be cleansed from your guilt and defilement in the precious blood of Christ. Behold! a poor criminal upon the cross with our Saviour, in his dying moments, effectually brought home!— His heart touched by the gracious and powerful hand of the Spirit of Christ! He believes and repents, and has a blessed, reviving promise of be∣ing with him, that very day in paradise, though he had been a heinous sinner, and continued such to the last!</P>
<P>This, <HI>poor dying man!</HI> is left upon record for you, that you may not totally despair, if you re∣main, even until this very hour in a sinful guilty state! The blessed Spirit can effectually reach your heart also, and bring you now at the eleventh hour, into the same happy circumstances. O that it would please God to come mightily upon you, and enable you heartily to embrace the offers of mercy, that are still made to you, and to fly to the blood of the all-sufficient Redeemer, which still stands as a foun∣tain opened for your purification and cleansing!— For this, we shall not cease looking to God for you,
<PB N="25" REF="010952_0023_0F8530649FEDDBD0"/>
while you are a subject of prayer. And do you also yourself, spend the few remaining moments you have, in crying mightily to God for mercy. And so we leave you with him, humbly and earnestly hoping, that that blessed promise of Christ, which he made to the poor, penitent thief upon the cross, will be verified to you.—"This day shalt thou be with me in paradise".</P>
<P>I shall close the discourse in a few words, briefly, to this numerous audience, come together upon this sad and affecting occasion.</P>
<P>My Brethren! What a sad and sorrowful specta∣cle have we before us! One of our fellow-creatures, whose soul is as precious as ours, to be made an example of public justice this day! Don't you pity, and compassionate his unhappy case? And don't you find it in your hearts, to lift up your fer∣vent cries to God, that he would have mercy upon his immortal soul that will presently be required of him? Methinks there is none of you, but what must find your bowels yearning towards him. That there are none here present, or in the great mul∣titude assembled in this place, this day, that can find it in their hearts, upon such a melancholy oc∣casion, to give into any merriment and jollity. How very unsuitable, yea, how shameful and scan∣dalous would this be! unworthy their character as men, and especially as christians! Instead of this, every one should be concerned to make a wise and good improvement of this dispensation. Every one should take occasion to thank God that he has not been left to such heinous transgressions, as would have
<PB N="26" REF="010952_0024_0F85306561D59F00"/>
exposed him to be cut off by the sword of civil justice, as this poor prisoner is to be.</P>
<P>Those that have habitually indulged themselves in sin and wickedness, should take warning by this example, that they do not go on any longer in it; lest they be left to such high-handed commissions, as to expose themselves in like manner. They should be put upon earnestly repenting and reforming, and devoting themselves to God, through Christ, that so they may be in favour with God and man.</P>
<P>Those that have the charge of youth, should be put upon the greatest care, to train them up in the ways of God—frowning upon their vices, exercising proper discipline towards them, when they give into any, restraining them as far as possible, setting vir∣tuous, religious examples before them; by which means abundance of mischief may, by the blessing of God, be prevented, and much good promoted.</P>
<P>None should presume too much upon their own strength—"Let him that standeth, take heed lest he fall". All of us should live a life of humble depen∣dance upon God, looking to him daily for his grace, which alone is sufficient for us, to keep us back from presumptuous sins and from secret faults—we should "watch and pray, lest we enter into tempta∣tion".</P>
<P>The saints and people of God should praise him for his grace, by which they are what they are; pardoned, justified, sanctified, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ to the heavenly inheritance. Let them live by faith in the Son of God, be strong in the grace that is in him, abound in every good word and work—continue faithful to the death, and with
<PB N="27" REF="010952_0025_0F8530660FA20B70"/>
joy and pleasure and patience wait for their glorious advancement to the presence and enjoyment of Christ in the heavenly paradise.</P>
<P>Lastly, Though the death of this poor criminal this day, is a violent, unnatural death, yet it should, however, put us all in mind of the great change of death that will pass upon us all, and it may be, as to some, sooner, than they may be aware of. If then we are found ready, blessed and happy are we, for a glorious life &amp; immortality will succeed. But if this great change should overtake us, in an impenitent, unpardoned, guilty, sinful state, it will be awful to us indeed, though the circumstances of our death should not be with the ignominy of this day. Persons may descend into everlasting burnings, though they should expire upon a bed of down, and every thing about them, be nice and delicate. In short, it is no matter where we die, or when, or after what manner, if our souls at death go to be with Christ in the heavenly paradise. — O let this be the main thing with us all, that when we quit this mortal life, as we must all do; that our souls, our nobler and better part, may be convoyed by the angels of God, to the presence of our exalted Redeemer in the paradise above. Our vile bodies, he will take care of, where ever deposited, and whatever changes may pass upon them, and re∣compact them, and raise them up, beautiful and glo∣rious, like to his own body, in the morning of the great day. And in our whole man he will invite us to the heavenly paradise to eat of the tree of life in the midst of it; rendring us eternally healthful, vi∣gorous and active. God of his infinite mercy grant, that this may be the case with us all, and that it
<PB N="28" REF="010952_0026_0F853066DEEA1BB8"/>
may be your case, poor <HI>Arthur!</HI> among the rest, for the sake of Jesus Christ to whom be glory, for∣ever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>The following Speech was deliver'd at the Place of Execution, in the Name and at the Desire of the Criminal.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Arthur,</HI> being just leaving the world, sincerely, as I hope, die in charity with all mankind. I desire to die, penitently acknowledging my wick∣edness before God and man, which has brought me to this untimely end. I humbly hope for mercy from God, solely through the merits of Jesus Christ. And as a dying man, just ready to step into the eternal world, I would give solemn warning to this great concourse, especially to young people, that they avoid all vices and immoralities, especially, the sins of <HI>stealing, lying, uncleanness, prophaneness,</HI> and <HI>drunkenness,</HI> by the indulgence of which, I have provoked God—fallen into the hands of civil justice, and must now die before the time.— I beseech all young people to fear and serve God in their youth, and that all who have the care and charge of them, would do all that lies in their power to restrain them from every vice, and to encourage them in the practice of every thing vir∣tuous and religious.—I now commend my de∣parting soul into the hands of the all-sufficient Redeemer; beseeching you all to lift up your hearts in fervent prayer to God, that he would receive me to his everlasting mercy.</P>
