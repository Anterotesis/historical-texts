<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH War be in its Nature and Tendency, a sore Calamity, and natural Fruit of Man's primitive Rebellion against his glorious Creator; and the just and holy So∣vereign of the Universe, be in this Way bearing Testimony against the crying Sins and Abomina∣tions of this Land, and shewing his just Dis∣pleasure against an ungrateful and rebellious Peo∣ple: Yet, adored he his great Goodness, he is intermixing much Mercy with his Judgments; in that he still continues to send his Messengers to invite us to Repentance; that so, in this Way, our final Ruin may be prevented.—Particularly—</P>
<P>It must be looked upon as a real Smile and signal Favour of Heaven upon our military En∣terprises, that divine Providence calls and dis∣poses, one and another of his faithful Servants in the Ministry, to go forth with, and become Teachers of our Army: Such a one I look upon the Author of the following suitable and affect∣ing Discourse to be; through which he breathes forth Love to his glorious Master, and his dearest Interest; as well as a Heart disposed to comply with the Call of Providence, and follow the Lamb wheresoever he leads, as one entirely re∣signed to his Lord's Will.—May Almighty GOD fasten deep these parting Counsels, on the Hearts of his dear People; keep them, feed
<PB N="ii" REF="007695_0003_102D9AFBDF66E8F0"/>
them, and watch over them in the Absence of their subordinate Steward and Watch-Man; be with the Author and his reverend Brethren, gone forth with him, on the same pious and important Design; make them fervent in Spi∣rit, faithful in reproving, and successful in dis∣pensing the Word of the Kingdom; that through their Labours the Camp may become the Birth∣place of many Sons to GOD, and our whole Army be made truly Christian-Soldiers, under the great Captain of our Salvation.—That he and his Brethren may be preserved amidst all Dan∣gers; and after our Army, under the divine Conduct, has obtained a glorious Victory, and removed the unjust Encroachments of our perfi∣dious Foes, be returned in Safety, and made, for a great While yet to come, rich Blessings to their respective Flocks.—That this and all the painful Labours of his dear Servant, may be blessed, for the spiritual and eternal Good of Souls, to the Praise of his own most glorious <HI>GRACE,</HI> is the earnest Prayer of his Fellow Labourer,—</P>

<P>And they all wept sore, and fell upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s Neck, and kissed him: Sorrowing most of all for the Words which he spake, that they should see his Face no more. And they accompanied him to the Ship.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SUCH is the State of this World wherein we dwell, and such the Nature of Things here, that we can find nothing certain or permanent, but all Things in a constant Fluctuation, and we are presented with a Scene of uninterrupted Change. —What Being then, endued with rational Powers, and acting like itself, can chuse his Portion here, or vainly expect Happiness in the Fruition of such changing and uncertain Trifles, as all the Creatures of Time, and Objects of Sense are?—As we find a constant Vicissitude, every Good in the Creature must necessarily be uncertain; so that what we call our Property To-day, may be in the Possession of another To-morrow; and what we have raised Expectations of enjoying, may never be ours. The Events of the pre∣sent Moment we see, but who can tell what will happen the next? All before us is dark and unknown, ex∣cept what is discovered by divine Revelation, or de∣pends upon the Promise of eternal Truth.—No
<PB N="2" REF="007695_0005_102D9AFFF46E5530"/>
Wonder then, that such as discard Revelation, not only become Sceptics, but fully commence a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om∣plish'd Atheists, in the Issue.—We may look back and view those changing Scenes of an all-wise Pro∣vidence, that we have pass'd through; Peace and War, Sickness and Health, Adversity and Prospe∣rity, and set the one over against the other: But if we look forward to a Space of Futurity, equal to that of our past Lives, who can say what shall hap∣pen? Shall not most, or all of us, be in the eternal World, where we shall see no more Changes? Blessed surely, and happy is he, that watcheth and keepeth his Garments.—</P>
<P>Friendship is one of the strictest Bonds, and sweet∣est Enjoyments of human Nature; yet by Reason of the changeable State of Things, this also is Vanity, and a Preparatory to Sorrow; for dearest Friends must part, and the strongest Ties of Nature be dis∣solved; the most kind and generous Benefactor, the most pleasant, obliging and agreeable Companion, the most sure and faithful Friend, must be removed; <HI>Lover and Friend will be put far from us, and our Ac∣quaintance into Darkness,</HI> Psal. 88, 18.</P>
<P>It is a most amiable, as well as essential Property of the Christian Religion, that it disposes to Love and Kindness. Benevolence truly so called, and brotherly Love are peculiar to the real Disciples of <HI>Jesus-Christ.</HI> Though from Constitution, or what is called, natural Temper, some may appear to be more amicable, kind and obliging, than others; yet that gracious Disposition, which the Gospel calls brotherly Love, has something truly divine, in its Nature; and is specifically different from any Thing that meer Nature does, or can produce, in fallen and depraved Humanity; there is something from Heaven rendered visible in the Object, which suitably influences the Subject: The divine Image, or Resemblance of God's
<PB N="3" REF="007695_0006_102D9B0323711308"/>
moral Perfections in the Former, and an agreeable Temper, or Relish for moral Beauty in the Latter, whence Love arises in the Subject towards its Objects, from proper and genuine Motives.—</P>
<P>The Felicity of the heavenly State consists in per∣fect Love, Freedom from Sin, and the full immediate Fruition of the ever-blessed God, who is the Sum and Comprehension, of all Glory, Excellency, Per∣fection and Blessedness; and just so far as we are dis∣posed to love God here, and one another, upon the same Grounds, and from the same Motives, as the blessed, and perfectly holy Inhabitants of the World of Glory, love God and one another; just so far are we real Christians, and no farther. Such a divine Temper as this, such a Relish for moral Excellency, in the real undissembled Disciples of our blessed Em∣manuel, was the Source of all that Grief which pos∣sessed their Hearts, and Spring of those Rivers of Tears, which flowed from their Eyes, at the De∣parture of Paul, their spiritual Father, the great Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI>—</P>
<P>In the Words of our Text, the <HI>Holy-Ghost</HI> inti∣mates, that it was not meerly the Apostle's Depar∣ture for a Season, that so deeply affected their Hearts, but it was this Expression of his, <HI>That they should see his Face no more,</HI> which pierced them to the very Center of their Souls.—The blessed Apostle went up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> expecting Persecution, and his Expec∣tation met with no Disappointment; hence the Dis∣ciples greatly fear'd, or rather reasonably concluded, that they should see his Face no more. Now the dark and gloomy Moment was come, wherein they must be, in all Probability, for ever deprived of so eminent an Instrument of their Comfort and Edifica∣tion; but especially, that by his Departure, they should lose such a bright Resemblance of God's moral Perfections, and shining Example of every Christian Grace and Virtue, which had in it the Force and
<PB N="4" REF="007695_0007_102D9B04D5E3D220"/>
Power of all other Motives, to excite them to Imita∣tion: This, ah! This, was what did rend their Hearts with Grief, and filled their Eyes with Tears.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, these Words teach us the en∣dearing mutual Love of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Disciples, one to∣wards another; and especially to their spiritual Guides and Teachers: Yet that there is no Relation, in Life, so near and dear, but must be dissolved, and a dark de∣parting Hour must come; and such is the imperfect State of the most sanctify'd Christian in this Life, that it would be next Door to impossible to ex∣clude every Degree of unsuitable Dependence on Ministers, or inordinate Affections towards them; and no Doubt at Paul's Departure, there was some Excess, in the Disciples Mourning.—</P>
<P>From the Words, in this View of them, we may infer these three Propositions, as the Subject of the following Discourse.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That there is a very peculiar Love and Affection that subsists between the true Disciples of Jesus Christ▪</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That the dearest Christian Friends should so live to∣gether and conduct towards one another, as that when they are called to a Seperation, they may depart in Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That God's People are liable to have too great a Dependence upon such as faithfully labour for their spi∣ritual and eternal Benefit.</HI>—</P>
<P N="1">I. Prop. <HI>That there is a very peculiar Love and en∣dearing Affection subsisting between the true Disciples of</HI> JESUS-CHRIST.</P>
<P>Love so much enters into both the Character and Temper of the true Christian, that the divine Author of this holy Religion makes it the Criterion of Sin∣cerity, and discriminating Badge of his guileless Fol∣lowers. It is the only convincing visible Evidence of Discipleship; <HI>John</HI> 13, 35. <HI>By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another:</HI> And it is a satisfying internal Evidence to every Believer's own Heart, i. <HI>John</HI> 3, 14. <HI>We know that we have passed
<PB N="5" REF="007695_0008_102D9B07565F6AC0"/>
from Death unto Life, because we love the Brethren.</HI> Love is an essential Branch of the Religion <HI>Christ</HI> taught, and a most important Duty which he has, both by his indisputable Authority and bright Exam∣ple, enjoin'd. How often does he repeat it! How pressingly insist upon it! And with what powerful Motives does he inculcate it upon the Minds of his Disciples! <HI>John</HI> xiii, 12.xv, 34.—And how full are the Apostolick Writings of the most cogent Ar∣guments and Incentives to this God-like Principle! 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.9. <HI>But as touching brotherly Love, ye need not that I write unto you, for ye yourselves are taught of GOD, to love one another.—Let brotherly Love continue—above all Things have fervent Charity.—If we have not Charity, we are Nothing.</HI>—</P>
<P>One great Design of the Gospel, is, to train Men up, meeten, and qualify them for the Fruitions and Employments of the heavenly State; to beget in them a Relish for, and a Temper suited to that Kind of Felicity, that Heaven consists in; which is perfect Love, eternal Peace, and universal Harmony. No contrary Interests, no jarring Lusts, no unruly Pas∣sions, or inordinate Affections, shall ever enter or subsist there; but perfect Love will for ever reign.—</P>
<P>This divine Propensity is the first Principle of all holy living, the very Root of all Conformity to the preceptive Will of God. Our blessed Saviour, who <HI>spake as never Man spake;</HI> and <HI>taught as One having Au∣thority,</HI> plainly declares, that Love to God and our Neighbour, are the two grand Topicks, or impor∣tant Commands, in which all, both the Law and the Prophets, are comprehended: And the Apostle makes Love, as it were, the Comprehension of all Reli∣gion; when he says, <HI>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</HI> Nor is there any Thing, wherein the Christian can more resemble the blessed God, than in This. Hence he says, <HI>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, for God is Love.</HI> Love, therefore, is that divine Principle which sovereign Grace implants in the Soul. The Face
<PB N="6" REF="007695_0009_102D7254E5CC8380"/>
of Things veil'd with any Degree of Darkness, may be brightened and illustrated by their Opposites, and judged by their Contraries: So here,—If we find a malevolent Temper, or Ill-Will towards our Bre∣thren and Fellow-Men, especially if it arises from those very Motives on which we ought to love them; it is a sad Sign that we are destitute of a gracious Princi∣ple at Heart.—All Malice, Strife, Envy and Ha∣tred, are diametrically opposite to the true Temper of a real Christian. It is the peculiar Property of the Christian, to have <HI>the same Mind,</HI> Temper or Disposi∣tion, <HI>in him, which was in</HI> Jesus-Christ. <HI>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit,</HI> like minded with <HI>Christ; that is,</HI> he loves what <HI>Christ</HI> loves, and hates what <HI>Christ</HI> hates; upon the same Motives. He that is begotten of GOD, and so is made truly gracious; so far as he is renewed and sanctified, resembles his heavenly Father; and in nothing more than in Love. All <HI>Christ</HI>'s Disciples are in Love with, and bear a Resemblance of the same infinitely amiable Object; therefore it is the Image of God, which the Saint sees in his Brother; which is the Ground of his brotherly Love and Christian Charity. <HI>He that loveth Him who begets, loveth Him also, who is begotten of Him</HI>; and that, on the Account of these amiable Qualities, wherein he sees him to resemble his hea∣venly Father: The divine Image discern'd in Chri∣stians, must, and cannot but attract every Heart that loves GOD supremely. The same Reasons hold for our Love to the Brethren, as for our Love to GOD; though not in the same Degree: GOD is in∣finitely, and absolutely amiable in himself; and the Saint is derivatively amiable, and therefore to be loved; not for himself, but for his Father's Sake, and in Proportion to that Degree of Likeness he bears to him.—by the Way—</P>
<P>Hence we may see, how much it concerns such as would be esteemed as Saints, and held in Charity; to act out and exhibit a divine Temper in all their Con∣duct.
<PB N="7" REF="007695_0010_102D9B0BEF5E5F90"/>
Your Brother cannot see your Heart, other∣wise than as your Life, Conduct and Conversation must be taken as an Index of the inward Frame and Temper of your Mind.—In vain therefore, do loose, frothy, carnal, careless Professors claim the Charity of the People of GOD.—In a Word,</P>
<P>How can it be but that such an endearing tender Love, should subsist among all <HI>Christ</HI>'s Disciples, one towards another; seeing they are Children of the same Father, Branches of the same Family, Mem∣bers of the same Body, fighting under the same glo∣rious Captain, all engaged in the same Interest, fed at the same Table, led by the same Spirit, initiated into the same Priviledges, travelling in the same Way, running the same Race, and Heirs of the same Inheritance; nay enrolled Citizens of the same new <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where they all hope, ere long, to meet in one great and general Assembly, to take Possession, each for himself, of a Crown and King∣dom, dwell for ever together in Fulness of Joy, bow before the Throne, and with all their Hearts and Tongues join in one eternal Song of Praise: Ascrib∣ing Glory and Honour, Thanksgiving, and Blessing to God, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.—</P>
<P N="2">II. Prop. <HI>It concerns christian Friends and Brethren so to live and conduct towards one another, that when they are called to a Separation, they may part in Peace.</HI>—</P>
<P>Here I shall, agreeable to the present moving and affecting Occasion, consider briefly, two Things.</P>
<P N="1">i. That <HI>such is the present State of Things in this Life, that the dearest Friends must part.</HI></P>
<P N="2">ii. Show <HI>how they ought to conduct, one towards another, while together; so as their Parting may be comfortable and peaceful.</HI>—I am to shew,</P>
<P N="1">i. That <HI>such is the State of Things in this Life, that the dearest Friends must Part.</HI>—Here let it be con∣sidered,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="007695_0011_102D9B0E0D24D288"/>1. That divine Providence may call Them to part, tho' they be continued in Life, and so in a State of Probation. This is so much our own present Case, that no other Instance need be introduced for Illustra∣tion. I am by an all-disposing Providence, called, so far as I am capable of judging in the Case, to part with my reverend and greatly esteemed Brethren, my beloved People and dear Family; and were it not that I fear lest I should be found to counteract infi∣nite Wisdom in it's providential Conduct; my strong Affections to Those I leave behind, in the various Re∣lations of Life, must have preponderated all other Reasons, determined my Continuance, and so pre∣vented my present Design. The Scene, which is just now opening to me, and the Province I am ready to enter upon, I can most freely say is what I never have either coveted or sought after; and as I have not, my dear People, look'd upon your generous and self-denying Consent to my leaving you, in Or∣der to serve the publick Interest, as any Argument at all of your Want of suitable Affections to your Minister; but as the genuine Fruit of a truly gene∣rous and publick Spirit; so I hope you will not en∣tertain my Departure (with your own manifest Con∣sent) as arising from any Want of Love to you, or of real and tender Regard for your Good; for it is the common Cause that I am still going to plead, and (as far as I shall thro' Grace be enabled) to pro∣mote.—As I do not entertain the least Doubt of your Affections towards me, even far beyond my Deserv∣ing; so I am very conscious of my own tender Re∣gard to you, and hearty Concern for your Prosperity and Welfare in all your Interests. Yet how closely soever we may be knit together in Affection; we must part, at least for a Season.—None can so well tell, how dear a People are to a faithful Minister of <HI>Christ</HI> as he himself; nor indeed can he so well judge of this, as when he is called to part with them: But be the
<PB N="9" REF="007695_0012_102D9B101960BC10"/>
Ties ever so strict, the Love ever so great, even tho' it should exceed that between <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and so our Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould recoil with greatest Reluc∣tance; yet he who has this Name upon his Vesture and upon his Thigh, <HI>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</HI> has an undeniable Right to separate us, at Pleasure; and deny us the Comfort of Co-habitation, Converse or Communion together, for just so long a Season as his infinite Wisdom sees fit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Death will most surely part us.—This relent∣less Tyrant, who has levelled all preceeding Genera∣tions with the Dust, spares neither for Age, or Sex, Relation or Character on Earth. He strikes as bold∣ly at the Palace of the King, as at the Cottage of the Beggar; regardless of Royalty, unmoved by all the struggling Reluctances of dying Nature, and wholly unaffected with all the Groans and Tears of the Af∣flicted, he strikes his Dart through the Liver, gives the mortal Blow, causes human Beauty at once to de∣cay as a Moth, and sends our earthly Tabernacles to inhabit the dark and solitary Mansions of all his Sub∣jects, that House prepared for all Living: Where we must abide till the Heavens are no more. We must ere long, as well as All that have gone before us, take our Turn in the dark and doleful Valley of the Shadow of Death, bid an everlasting adieu to Time and Sense, with all their Objects and Fruitions, and become Strangers to all the Living; and how soon this will be the Case, or what One of us will be the next Trophy of that grand Conqueror of human Nature, who can tell? I am now going into the Midst of Deaths, where his Darts fly thick, mak∣ing an awful Carnage, by spreading Slaughter and Bloodshed, and which of them may have Commis∣sion to smite my Heart, and dislodge my Soul, no One besides the great Author of Life knows: But should I escape, what may I expect to hear, but the bitter heart-rending Groans of the Wounded and Ex∣piring,
<PB N="10" REF="007695_0013_102D9B123559FD50"/>
and view the affecting crimson Scene, of Garments roll'd in Blood! What can my Mind for∣bode, but to see my Fellow-Mortals, on all Hands, falling by the prepared Instruments of Death and Devastation; and to hear Many, whilst their guilty Souls are passing away by the gaping Wound, or sallying forth in a Flood of reeking Gore, cry out in dying Agonies for the Saviour, they have all their Life-time slighted and lived Strangers unto, whilst with the most affecting Accents of bitterest Grief, too late, alas! too late, they lament the Sins and Follies of a mis-spent Life, and feel the now remedi∣less Misery of a Christless State.—Most awful Scene! Most rueful Spectacle!</P>
<P>Nor am I insensible, that I cannot abide, by Rea∣son of Death: The Prophets do not live for ever!— When ever as an Hireling I have fulfilled my Day, and arrived at the Bounds over which I cannot pass, I must go the Way whence I shall not return, whe∣ther it be at Home or Abroad, in the Field or on the Bed, amongst Friends or Enemies, in a natural or violent Manner, in the full Vigour of Life or un∣der the Decline of old Age; in that Way which in∣finite Wisdom pleases, I know God will bring me to Death, and to the House prepared for all Living: And should the Kindness and Indulgence of Heaven make my frail Life it's Care, preserve amidst the In∣struments of Death, guard my Constitution from the Power of those Diseases, that are the usual and al∣most inseperable Attendants of the Camp, and restore me to you again; I never—never expect to find you all alive. You are I know deeply concern'd for my Safety and Preservation, and afraid I shall not live to return; but has Death nothing to do but in the Field? May not you be smitten by the Pestilence that walketh in Darkness, as suddenly as I may fall by the Arrow that flyeth at Noon-Day? What therefore I would say both to myself and to you all
<PB N="11" REF="007695_0014_102D9B13CFF35020"/>
is this, <HI>Prepare for Death.</HI> Live, Oh! Live in a constant Readiness for that solemn, that trying Mo∣ment of your great and last Change.—So many Things must be hinted, in the Space of a few Mo∣ments, that I must hasten to say,—</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How Brethren ought to live and walk together in Order to part in Peace.</HI> Now in Order to a comfort∣able and peaceful Parting, you must live and walk just so as you will wish you had when you come to dye, or so as to have no Self-Condemnation, or the Sting of a reproaching Conscience when you come to part. Every personal and relative Duty must be re∣ligiously attended and faithfully performed; all the Rules of Christianity, relating either to Heart or Life, must be practised; good Examples must be set; every Opportunity and Advantage must be wisely improved, to promote the Good of our Fel∣low-Men in all their Interests; their Characters ten∣derly used and defended, their outward Estates pro∣moted, and their Prosperity rejoiced in, their Ad∣versity, to our Power, prevented, and grieved for; the spiritual Interest of their precious Souls sought and promoted, as far as ever the Influence of a pious Ex∣ample, wholesome Counsels and faithful Reproofs can reach.—Now my dear Brethren we are coming to the Trial, and may have Occasion to review our past Conduct towards one another. And now, just so far as you have thus conducted towards your Mini∣ster; so far as you have been tender of my Character, befriended my Interest and Influences, and promoted my Usefulness in my sacred Office, I heartily thank you for it; and you will now experience the Comfort of it,—upon our Parting; even tho' it should prove a final Parting as to Time. So far as I have in any Respects fail'd towards you, I intreat your Forgive∣ness, and earnestly implore divine Pardon from a heavenly Father, thro' his beloved Son, the great Mediator. I am sensible of various and great Imper∣fections,
<PB N="12" REF="007695_0015_102D9B196CDD7940"/>
and my Subjection to like Passions and In∣firmities with others; yet I am conscious of a pain∣ful Desire, and honest Endeavour to procure and pro∣mote the eternal Welfare of precious Souls; and in every Respect to answer the great Design of my sacred Office. The little Fruit I have brought forth, and the small Success I have had in winning Souls to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> pains my very Heart: Not that I mean to re∣proach you, my dear Hearers, but to mourn over you, in Imitation of my compassionate Lord and Master. O <HI>Jerusalem, Jerusalem!</HI> &amp;c.—<HI>How often would I have gathered thy Children!</HI> &amp;c. How often have I had Reason to complain, with the unsuccess∣ful Prophet, <HI>Lord who hath believed our Report, and to whom has the Arm of the Lord been revealed!</HI> Yet fruit∣less as my Labours have been, I must leave you; and what will be the Consequence with Regard to you, God only knows; but into his merciful Hands I commit, and to his compassionate Care I leave you, with myself and my dear Family.—And proceed to the</P>
<P N="3">III. Prop. <HI>People are disposed to have too great a Dependence upon the faithful Ministers of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Men are exceeding prone to trust in Means, or rely upon Instruments, that have done good to them; and I am the more afraid that this is the Case with you, while I see such large Expressions of over bear∣ing Grief now I am going to leave you. O <HI>what mean you,</HI> my People, <HI>thus to weep and to break my Heart!</HI> I feel a Desire to comply with the Call of Providence, whatever befal me. Remember I am but a frail Instrument, and have this Treasure in an earthen Vessel: I can give no Efficacy to the Truths I deliver. <HI>Paul may Plant and Apollos Water. It is God, who giveth the Increase.</HI> O! then, <HI>weep not for me, but weep for Yourselves and your Children.</HI> Beware of Extreams, neither despise Means, nor idolize them. To trust in Means is to set them in the
<PB N="13" REF="007695_0016_102D9B1B0C4FFA40"/>
Room of <HI>Christ,</HI> which is very dishonouring to the divine Redeemer, and therefore extreamly provoking to an holy and jealous God.—Means are indeed very precious Blessings, but it is only by the Influence of the blessed Spirit of all Grace, that Means are of saving Benefit. They will not awaken one stupid secure Sinner, or so much as restrain from the Prac∣tice of one Sin; far less will they change the Heart of Stone into an Heart of Flesh, or alter the moral Temper and Disposition of the Soul, without a di∣vine Blessing, or the immediate and powerful Agency of the Holy Ghost. Doubtless the Christians of <HI>Mi∣letus</HI> and <HI>Ephesus</HI> had too great a Dependence on <HI>Paul,</HI> when drowned in Floods of Tears, they fell on his Neck, with Expressions of uncommon Grief at his Departure. But our whole Reliance should be on God alone, in the Use of Means: This is the Way for a Blessing.—</P>
<P>What now remains is to make some <HI>Improvement</HI> of what has been observed.</P>
<P>I am now to take my Leave of you, <HI>the Flock of my Charge</HI>; you may easily believe my sorrowful Heart is greatly born down with a Sense of those Things that have now been spoken.—I remember well my Ordination Vow, and know I must give an Account in the Capacity of a <HI>Watchman,</HI> and as One, who has been charged in particular <HI>to Watch for your Souls.</HI> The Occasion that calls me away is melan∣choly, my Departure is attended with Sorrow, and the State, wherein I leave this dear Flock of the Lord, grieves me sorely. I must leave Many awfully asleep in carnal Security, some just born into <HI>Christ</HI>'s spiritual Kingdom, <HI>who need Milk and not strong Meat</HI>; whilst damnable Errors abound, ravening Wolves seeking to devour the Sheep, little Foxes spoiling the tender Vines. My Vineyard appears to me in a de∣plorably dangerous State; the Hedge broken down, the Watchman call'd away, Enemies on every Side, fashionable deistical Heresy just in the Bud, <HI>Mora∣vian</HI>

Inconsistency and Jargon, with all the wheed∣ling and delusive Insinuations of Flattery, and false Pretences to Love, Meekness, and Humility, ready to scatter Snares and Darkness in your Paths, by which it is a Thousand to One but Some will be caught, and eternally undone.—I most earnestly beseech you, from the very Bottom of my Heart, in the Bowels of the compassionate <HI>Jesus,</HI> that you do not take the Opportunity of my Absence to destroy Yourselves.— If you dread eternal Damnation, and desire ever∣lasting Happiness, take the Counsels that have been given you, and live in the Religion I have taught you, and be on your Guard.—<HI>Watch and Pray that ye enter not into Temptation.</HI>—</P>
<P>The more Love and Friendship there is among us, the more grievous is our Parting; but if our Love be of the right Sort, and well grounded, we love God above all, and one another in Him.—Tho' I must leave you, yet I hope and trust the blessed God will never leave nor forsake you; but the great Shepherd will himself <HI>feed the Sheep and Lambs of his own Flock, which he hath purchased with his own Blood,</HI> and <HI>watch over you for Good, Day and Night.</HI> I thank you for all your Kindness towards me, and pray God forgive such as have merited a different Character.—How∣ever trying it be to me to part with You and my Fa∣mily (which I leave with You, and for whom I now bespeak your tender Care and Kindness in my Ab∣sence) yet I have this to support me, even the Tes∣timony of my own Conscience, <HI>that I have not shunned to declare the whole Counsel of God unto you</HI>; and I doubt not but I have a Testimony in your own Breasts, that I have not trifled with you, or only complimented you with dry fashionable Harangues, or pleased your carnal Taste, and fed your natural Pride with polite Declamations, in Praise of heathenish Morality: Nor have I studied to please Men, but God who put me in Trust with the Ministry of his dear Son. Ye are my Witnesses, my Brethren, that a crucified

<HI>Christ</HI> has been the great and delightful Theme of my publick Performances, and how I have ever in∣sisted on the great and essential Doctrines of Faith, Repentance and Regeneration.—You have not this to say, in your own Excuse, that you <HI>have never heard that there is a Holy Ghost,</HI> never heard the Way of Life, and Gospel-Terms of Peace with God: Or never had the Nature of Conversion open'd and ex∣plain'd to you, and the absolute Necessity of it warmly urged upon your Consciences. I have never taught you that the Law is abated in Proportion as we have lost our Power; nor have I ever endea∣voured to gain you over to that God-contemning deistical Conceit, that the great God has made the Creature his last End, and regards not the Honour and Glory of his adorable Perfections, by far so much as he does the Creature's Happiness; or that no Afflictions or Sufferings are of a penal Nature, but merely correc∣tive and purgatorial; and that Such as are obstinate, and will not be reclaimed here, shall, when they die, commence a new State of Probation under more se∣vere Discipline, until they are brought to a right Temper of Mind, and so in the final Result all rati∣onal Nature shall be happy; and herein the ultimate End of the great Creator be fully attained.—All such Stuff, I now take an Opportunity, to bear publick Testimony against as damnable, and there∣fore most dangerous Heresy. God must be esteemed the wisest as well as best of Beings, and therefore must accordingly esteem Beings, and the Happiness and Honour, of each One of them according to their true Worth and Excellency.—<HI>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. For it is the Power of God to every One</HI> of every Nation, <HI>that believes</HI>; and it pleases God <HI>by the Foolishness of it to save Those that believe,</HI> that in this Way <HI>he may confound the Wisdom of the Wise,</HI> or crafty Disputers, of this World. I am cheerfully willing to venture my own eternal Interest upon the Truth of that Religion, I have taught you

—I hope I am far from making a vain glorious Boasting: But the Occasion, with all its attending Circumstances and Prospects, will justify me in every candid and unprejudiced Mind, when I say, I have never <HI>daub'd with untemper'd Mortar,</HI> nor <HI>sew'd Pillows under your Arm-holes</HI>; but have laboured to search the Wound to the Bottom, and to beat you off from all Trust in your own Strength and Righteousness, and lead you to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for compleat Salvation; and still I love you, and long for your Salvation; and <HI>my Hearts Desire and Prayer to God for you,</HI> Night and Day whilst in this World, shall be <HI>that you all may be saved.</HI>—I have been careful to leave you under as good Circumstances as I possibly can, and am willing farther <HI>to spend and be spent for you</HI>; and hope, <HI>thro' the good Hand of my God upon me,</HI> yet to labour a∣mongst You.—But <HI>the Will of the Lord be done.</HI>—</P>
<P>Have I not repeatedly called upon you, that are Parents, to order your Families according to your Covenant-Vows, by governing your Housholds in the Fear of the Lord, instilling good Principles into Youth, training them up for God, in the Way they should go, whilst their Minds are tender and easily impressed; and by setting before them an Example of all virtuous and holy Living? How frequently have I urged upon you that are young, Obedience and Duty to Parents, and to remember your Creator in the Days of your Youth, to forsake the Foolish and live, and walk in the Way of Understanding? But what Effect my Counsels and Warnings have generally had upon Old and Young, I know not; and now perhaps this may be the Case, that <HI>Ye shall see my Face no more:</HI> Let me therefore, fill up our parting Interview with what a beloved Peo∣ple may justly expect from a faithful Steward in the House of God.—Suffer me then, briefly to hint to you the Sins that are most prevalent amongst us, and call loudly for Repentance and Reformation: And finish with my best Counsel and Advice to you.—

Time will not allow me either to make a methodical Arrangement of common Vices, or open up their Nature and Aggravations; but are not these provok∣ing Evils found amongst us? Great Contempt of Gos∣pel-Grace; Profanation of the Lord's Day; mispense of precious Time; awful Security in Sin, and under Judgments; Neglect of Worship, Instructions and Government in Families; as well as great and mani∣fest Carele<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ess respecting publick Worship and Ordi∣nances; a great Want of brotherly Love, whence arise Backbitings, Slanderings, letigious Law-Suits, and unchristian Contentions of divers Kinds; Intem∣perance, Chambering and Wantonness, Rioting and Drunkenness, Pride and Covetousness; with sundry more that might be named.—My parting Advice therefore, to Old and Young, is to reform and repent of all these Abominations; and O! Be con∣cern'd, yea even dread a Continuance in a carnal, Christless and unrenewed Estate.—Bend your Minds to the Things of another World, and labour to keep this World under your Feet.—Get into <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and make thorough Work of Religion; earnestly cry to the Father of Lights to give you a saving Ac∣quaintance with his dear Son, and an Heart to love Him supremely, and one another fervently.—Be constant and importunate in secret Devotions; give Way to no Temptations; bear hard against every Sin.— Maintain religious Conferences, and Seasons of Prayer▪ search the Scriptures daily; study the Things that make for Peace, and whereby you may edify one another.—I earnestly bespeak your servent Prayers to God for me, that I may be faithful to the Trust reposed in me, preserved amidst all Dangers, and by the Will of God have a safe and joyful Re∣turn unto you.—If this is my final Remove,—Let me beseech you; beware of every One who would bring you <HI>another Gospel than you have received</HI>; even tho' <HI>it were an Angel from Heaven</HI> receive him not, hear him not, neither bid him <HI>Godspeed:</HI> But if you

have any Regard to the Interest of <HI>Christ,</HI> any Love to your own Souls, and the Souls of your dear Posteri∣ty, seek One to succeed me, who gives all proper Evidence both in Conduct and Preaching, that he has saving Acquaintance with <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the great Subject of Gospel-Preaching, and the Life of God in his own Soul. Never, ah! never, my dear Bre∣thren, knowingly commit the Guidance of your Souls, and the Souls of Your's to the Blind. I had much rather, you should spend the Lord's Day in Prayer, in Reading and Hearing sound practical and experimental Discourses, that have been published by godly Divines, than in a cold, formal Round of fashionable Declamations from this Desk.—O may a merciful God forbid, this should ever be your sad Case. And should You and I never meet any more, till we meet in the eternal World, let this last Advice of a departed Friend abide upon your Minds.— <HI>Finally Brethren I commend you to God and to the Word of his Grace.—Beware lest after my Departure grievous Wolves enter in among you, not sparing, but rending and devouring the Flock. And lest even from among Yourselves Men should arise speaking perverse Things to draw away Disciples after them.</HI>—Be perfect, be of <HI>one Mind; live in Love and Peace. And may the God of Peace dwell with you.</HI> To the Youth, ye dear Lambs of this Fold! as I have often heretofore, so I now, once more, and perhaps once for all, beseech you to <HI>flee all youthful Lusts</HI>; betake Yourselves to a serious and religious Life; learn to pray and live to God. If your Parents are faithful you will hear many good Counsels, and improving Instructions, as well as be under the daily Influence of pious Examples, besure hearken to the One, and imitate the Other, and herein comply with the Advice you have repeatedly had from this Desk; and if I should see your Faces no more in this World, let me find none of you, among that wretched Crew on <HI>Christ</HI>'s left Hand at the last Day, lest all the Pains taken with you, and

Priviledges enjoy'd by you, enhance your Guilt, and then aggravate your Misery; and I, who am now your compassionate Counsellor, be then a swift Witness against you. But pursue Repentance to∣wards God, and Faith in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>▪ that ye may be found in Him, and we may rejoice together; that when I shall be called for, I may with Pleasure an∣swer, <HI>Lord here am I and the Children which thou hast given me.</HI>—Which God of his infinite Mercy grant, thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> to whom be Honour and Glory for ever.
