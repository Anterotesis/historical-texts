<P>'TIS usual with those who write any thing for the public, to have a dedication of a prefatory discourse. As for me, I have no Maecenas, to whom I shall dedicate my little tract. And if my dis∣courses do not recommend themselves, by any in∣trinsic worth, I shall not be so vain and futile as to pretend to recommend them in a preface.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 SAMUEL, VIII.22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the Lord said to <HI>Samuel,</HI> Hearken unto their voice, and make them a King. And <HI>Samuel</HI> said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN good Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, who had long judged Israel well, was grown old, and by reason of the in∣firmities of age was rendered very inca∣pable of the important trust, and could no longer judge and govern the people, he made his sons Joel and Abiah judges over Israel. But Israel soon growing uneasy under the government and presidency of his sons, by reason of their evil govern∣ment and male-administration, for they walked not in the steps of Samuel their father, it occasioned great mutinies and contentions: till finally, the uneasiness of the people grew so great, and they were so highly disgusted at the administrations of his sons, all the elders of Israel ga∣thered themselves together, and came unto Samuel, to Ramah, and told him, what he was well sensible of, of
<PB N="4" REF="014036_0004_0F92ACC51C592420"/>
his own incapacity to judge and govern them as he had done, and complained to him aloud of the ill-manage∣ment of his sons—that they had left the right way of go∣verning which he had so happily pursued, and rendered themselves extremely odious on that account, and even intolerable to the people. And now they manifest their desire of a King, one who should rule according to right and equity; and pray his assistance to constitute and set one over them, to judge, rule and govern them, as was customary in all other nations.</P>
<P>SAMUEL intimates his displeasure at their request of a King; fearing they did not pay that respect to Jehovah which they ought; and from the Lord he shews them the manner of the King who should reign over them; how he would conduct with them, their families and inheri∣tances, and what would be the maxims of that govern∣ment which he would exercise over the people, in the course of his reign. Notwithstanding all this, the peo∣ple persisted in their request of a King, and still continu∣ed their petition. And though perhaps the circumstances attending Israel's request at this time, and their obstina∣cy in it, after the prophets remonstrances against it, were not to be commended, the Lord so far overlooked this, that he commanded Samuel to hearken to, and gratify the people, by accomplishing their desire in constituting a King to rule and govern them.</P>
<P>THEN Samuel says to the men of Israel, be contented and easy in your minds, go every man unto his city, and patiently wait until I shall be instructed further concern∣ing a King, and the method of his being constituted over you, and placed in his royal dignity and government.</P>
<P>FROM the words now read unto you, and thus intro∣duced, I shall propose the following things to be discours∣ed upon, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and constitute a King supreme, and all subordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and safety.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="014036_0005_0F92ACC89DB32E10"/>II. I SHALL undertake to shew what are the duties and obligations of a King thus erected by the people, and of all subordinate rulers and civil officers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. WHAT are the duties and obligations of the peo∣ple in civil state, to their civil rulers, both supreme and subordinate, whilst they fulfil their trust, and answer their obligations to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. I SHALL endeavour to prove that the people have right and authority to dethrone their King, and put down all other civil officers and rulers of subordinate degree, whenever they shall counteract their obli∣gations, and cease to answer the ends of their consti∣tution and appointment to places of civil trust and power.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I SHALL not undertake very scrupulously to enquire whether all these propositions have a real foundation, and in being in the words of my text, and may be clearly de∣ducted from them, or not; it shall suffice for me, if they are true, and capable of substantial proof and vindication, which I shall endeavour to shew them to be. I begin with the first, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and constitute a King supreme, and all subor∣dinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and safety.</P>
<P>HOWEVER true, and capable of clear proof from reason and the nature of things, this proposition may appear to unprejudiced and thinking men, yet it is denied by some, whose minds are full of prejudiced notions, and who are less capable of reasoning closely and judging right.</P>
<P>SOME of the greatest men that ever wrote on politics, have asserted and maintained that all civil powers and authority originates from the people: with whom I hear∣tily agree. Others whose learning and judgment in other things ought not to be impeached, have asserted and en∣deavoured to maintain that King's derive their power and authority to reign over the people from God only: with whom I cannot agree.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, not regarding so much what any men have
<PB N="6" REF="014036_0006_0F92ACC8D6EF75C0"/>
said or wrote, for or against the present proposition, my business is to prove and vindicate its truth; which I shall endeavour to do in the subsequent propositions, reason∣ings and conclusions.</P>
<P>EVERY single man in a state of nature, and before any thing is given up by him, to a civil State, or Com∣munity, for the general good, utility and happiness of such State or Community, by voluntary and solemn league, covenant and compact, hath a principle of in∣dividuation; <HI>i. e.</HI> he hath such natural and undoubted right to, and property in some things, as no other man upon earth has: He has something he may justly call his own, and may appropriate it to himself, in such a sense as no other man may call it his, or appropriate it to himself.</P>
<P><HI>A,</HI> HATH a right to, and property in, his hand, in such a sense as <HI>B</HI> hath not, nor can have; he may with great justice call his hand his own, and he hath an indi∣vidual and entire right to, and property in his hand, which <HI>B</HI> cannot have. And it would be a manifest and intolerable invasion of <HI>A</HI>'s right and property, if <HI>B</HI> should pretend to lay claim to his hand, or presume to use it as though it were his own, and as though he had a just right to, and property in it. This pretence, and this conduct in <HI>B,</HI> would be downright injustice, a pre∣tence and action plainly contradictory to truth, which is always unjust. If <HI>A</HI> hath such right to, and property in his hand, as he is now said to have, it follows, that he hath a right to make use of his hand, for his own ends and purposes, and according as he shall please: and <HI>B</HI> can have no right or authority to rise up and forbid <HI>A</HI> the use of his hand, or to dispute with him his liberty and authority to use it according to his own pleasure. For such conduct would evidently declare that <HI>B</HI> has some right to <HI>A</HI>'s hand, evidently contrary to truth, for he has none: for if <HI>B</HI> has no right to <HI>A</HI>'s hand, according to the supposition, then certainly he can have no just right or authority to forbid <HI>A</HI> that use of it he shall please to put it to: For all authority and dominion are founded in right and property.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014036_0007_0F92ACC9F815A2B0"/>LET <HI>A</HI> then use his hand as he pleases, he is not, in so doing, abusing any property, or invading any right of <HI>B</HI>; therefore <HI>B</HI> has no just cause to complain, or any authority to command or direct <HI>A,</HI> concerning the use of his hand, use it as he will.</P>
<P>NOW, if <HI>A</HI> hath such an individual, uncontroulable right to his hand, to one hand, he hath, to all intents and purposes, the same right also to the other; and if he hath such right to, and property in his hands, he hath also in his feet; and if so, then he hath the same, or an individual right, to his head and heart, and his whole body: for it would puzzle any one to ascertain what property <HI>A</HI> hath to any one part of his body, that he hath not to any other part of it, or to shew that he hath not the same property in one part as in an o∣ther, for all his own purposes and designs. <HI>A</HI> hath then an individual right to his whole body. <HI>A</HI> hath such a right to, and property in his whole body as <HI>B</HI> hath not, nor can pretend to have, without great and intolerable injury and injustice: So that <HI>A</HI> hath an individual and undisputable right to himself.</P>
<P>NOW, <HI>A</HI> having such right to, and property in him∣self, to all the limbs, powers and faculties of his body, may use himself, and these powers and faculties of his, as he shall judge it convenient, and for his own interest, and purposes of life.</P>
<P>Accordingly, <HI>A</HI> labours with his hands, uses them in various secular employments, and is industrious in his business, for his support and maintenance. We will suppose for the sake of clearness and conviction, that <HI>A</HI> takes a piece of unoccupied land, which is claimed by no inhabitant of the earth; upon this ground he settles and builds, brings on cattle, so soon as prepared for them, and other living creatures, for his support and conveniency. Here he lives a number of years, manages his business alone, and seperate from all near society with any other rational beings, and gains a considerable estate. Now <HI>A</HI> while he dwells here alone, hath an in∣dividual
<PB N="8" REF="014036_0008_0F92ACCC144986F8"/>
right to his land, and all that he hath brought upon it, and the effects of his own labour and toil upon it; to the Land he hath the right of prime occupancy, a very just and good right; and to all the fruits and ef∣fects of his labours, he hath just as good a right, as he hath to his hands, with which he laboured. But he meets with many difficulties and inconveniencies in his lonely situation; till at length, the difficulties of his dwelling a∣lone, and the great and many hardships he endures in this state, so seperate and solitary, convince him ef∣fectually of the truth of what the God of nature long since observed, that
<Q>it is not good that men should be alone.</Q>
He now finds an inclination to society, and communion with some of his fellow rational crea∣tures. Therefore he comes forth of his long seclusion and confinement from society, and gets among mankind. He cultivates an acquaintance with a lady, whom he, in proper time, takes to wife and with this very agreeable companion, he returns to his former habitation and im∣provements; where they each labour with a joint design, and for a joint interest. Not to be tedious here, he has by Heaven's kind indulgence and blessing, a family which he educates and brings up as well as his circum∣stances will admit.</P>
<P>NOW, this man and his family, when considered with reference to mankind, have an absolute and individual right to, and property in all they have earned by their labours, industry and frugality: Such right and pro∣perty as no others can pretend to have, without great wrong and injustice. They may call their estate their own, and have full power and authority to use it as their own; <HI>i. e.</HI> as they shall judge best, to answer their own designs and intentions.</P>
<P>No man, or number of men have a right to disturb <HI>A</HI> in the enjoyment of his family and estate, or property: For to suppose them to have such right, would be to suppose them to have some property in <HI>A</HI>'s family and estate; for if they have no such property, the supposi∣tion that they have right to molest or disturb <HI>A</HI> in the en∣joyment
<PB N="9" REF="014036_0009_0F92ACCCB9687110"/>
of his family, and the possession of his estate, is impossible: for if one man has no property in the pos∣sessions of another, he certainly can have no right to give any molestation to this other man in the enjoyment of them: which is a very plain case to every one, who thinks ever so little. If <HI>B</HI> has no right to begin to give mo∣lestation to <HI>A,</HI> who is quietly and peaceably enjoying his own estate, then neither has <HI>C, D</HI> or <HI>E,</HI> or any other; for <HI>E</HI> has as much right to <HI>A</HI>'s estate as <HI>B</HI> has, that is, none at all; and so it is with <HI>C, D,</HI> and all the rest. For what any one man hath as just a right to, as any other, e∣very man in the world, or all men, have as just a right to; but what every man hath a just right to, one as much as any other, none of them all has any just right to; for in such case, an equal right among all man∣kind, cannot be accounted any right at all. So that no man upon earth hath any just right to begin to disturb <HI>A</HI> in the enjoyment of his family and estate.</P>
<P>BUT yet, tho' <HI>B</HI> has no just right to give disturbance or molestation to <HI>A,</HI> who is quiet in the enjoyment of his estate, or to begin to make him unhappy, <HI>A</HI> hath an undoubted right to resist and repel every attempt of <HI>B</HI> to invade his property, and to make him unquiet: Else, we must inevitably deny <HI>A</HI>'s property in his estate, which we have above proved him to have. For he that hath no right to defend his property, hath no property at all: for to defend any thing from invasions, and to secure to one's self, the enjoyment of it, are the same thing with using it as our own; but in any thing, which we have not a right to use as our own, we can never be said to have the sole property: therefore, if we have not a right to defend our estates, and to secure the enjoyment of them to ourselves, we have not the sole property in them: If <HI>A</HI> has not a right to defend his estate, and to secure the enjoyment of it to himself, against all the invasions of <HI>B, C, D, E,</HI> &amp;c. he hath not the sole property in it: but that <HI>A</HI> hath an individual and independent right and property in his estate, is according to the supposi∣tion,
<PB N="10" REF="014036_0010_0F92ACCD670808F0"/>
therefore <HI>A</HI> hath an undoubted right to defend his estate from all invasions of <HI>B,</HI> or any other, and to secure to himself the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>THUS we must conclude, that <HI>A,</HI> or any man, hath an undoubted right, in a state of nature, which is all along the supposition, to defend his estate, yea, and most certainly his person too, from all unjust attempts upon them, or invasions of them from any quarter whatsoever. No man will dispute any one's right to defend and se∣cure his person from all assaults and injuries, if he al∣lows him to have right to defend and secure his estate; for he had a property in his person which no other man could pretend to, without great injustice and violation of truth, before he acquired his estate: And it was done by the labours he himself bestowed, and the use of his own limbs, that he gained his estate. <HI>A</HI> then hath an indisputable right to defend his person and property from all attempts, come whence, or from whom they may, and to secure the enjoyment of them to himself.</P>
<P>THIS reasoning may be carried yet farther, for if this be the case, if <HI>A</HI> hath such an indisputed right to defend his person and property from all injuries and assaults whatsoever, and to secure to himself the quiet enjoy∣ment of them, then he hath most certainly a right to make reprisals in case his person be injured, and his pro∣perty be taken out of his possession and enjoyment, upon that man who shall be so intolerably unjust, and have so little regard to truth, as to commit such injury upon his person, and make such invasion of his property. For if <HI>A</HI> hath an indisputable and individual right to his person and property, and to defend them from all as∣saults, and secure to himself the enjoyment of them, then, if his person chance to be injured, and his pro∣perty seized and used by another, he hath just as good a right to an equivalent to the injury done his person, and to the estate which was seized and taken from him, as he has to his person and estate, or property. For to say a man has an indisputable and individual right to his
<PB N="11" REF="014036_0011_0F92ACCE273965A8"/>
person and property, and to defend and secure to him∣self the enjoyment of them, against all invasions and as∣saults that may be made upon them, and yet, that he hath not a right, if his person be injuriously treated, and his property seized and used by another, without his consent, to an equivalent for the injury done to his person and property in the assault and seizure, is a flat contradiction. For to have an individual right to any thing, and a right to an equivalent to that thing, if the thing be taken away, and he who had the individual right, be now deprived of the enjoyment of the thing, are the same. He therefore who hath an individual right to his person and property, and to defend and secure to himself the enjoyment of them against all assaults and invasions whatsoever, hath a right to an equivalent to any injury that shall be done his person, or seizure of his property; <HI>i. e.</HI> he hath a right to make reprisals up∣on any man who shall injure his person, or invade his property, whensoever opportunity shall present for this purpose.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE conclude, that every man in a state of nature, or where no civil government is yet erected, hath an individual and most just right to an equivalent to any injury that shall be done his person, or any in∣vasion and seizure of his property; and that whereso∣ever he shall find it, in the possession of him who did the wrong, and whensoever he shall have an opportunity, to take it to himself. And all the mischief and blood∣shed, if there should be any, while the injured man de∣fends his person, or is taking to himself his equivalent for the seizure of his estate or property, must forever lye at the door of him who did the injury.</P>
<P>BUT who is not apprised of the terrible contests, the horrid and spreading mischiefs, the bloodshed and the death, which will inevitably follow and take place, if every man must defend and secure his own person and property against the assaults and ravages of all others, who shall from time to time injure his person, or invade his property: If he must also, as he hath an undoubted
<PB N="12" REF="014036_0012_0F92ACD032A7CDD0"/>
right to do, in reason and conscience, make reprisals whensoever his person is injured, or his property invaded and seized? He that is so unjust, and pays so little re∣gard to truth, as to injure another person, or invade and seize his property, when he hath a convenient opportu∣nity for such black designs, will certainly, if he be pur∣sued by the injured man, and pressed upon by him who is engaged to obtain his right, or an equivalent, de∣fend himself at all adventures; even though he should be the death of him whom he hath so villainously injured already: For he who shall prove the strongest and most powerful in this sorry contest will get the victory, tho' he should hazard the other's life and fortune all toge∣ther.</P>
<P>BUT if we suppose that several, or ever so large a number of families, have settled in the neighbourhood of <HI>A,</HI> whom we have supposed hitherto to be alone, with only his own family; still the same truths may be asserted of them all. Every individual of ever so large a society, whilst they remain in a state of nature, has an individual right to his person and property, and very just authority to defend them from all assaults and inva∣sions whatsoever, and to secure the enjoyment of them to himself.</P>
<P>YET in such a degenerate, unjust and disingenuous world as we live in, 'tis very possible that many may league, associate, and combine together to give dis∣turbance to some one man in the enjoyment of his per∣son and property: they may agree to injure and abuse his person, and to seize upon his property and estate, and to take and use them as their own, contrary to his will, and without any consent of his.</P>
<P>THUS injury and rapine may be committed upon the person and property of any individual; and he, tho' he has a natural, inherent and indisputable right to his person and property, and to defend and secure them, what can he do in such case? how shall he go about to assert his right, and defend his person and es∣tate from the injury, rapine and ravages of this lawless
<PB N="13" REF="014036_0013_0F92ACD06D4FC310"/>
and unnatural combination? how shall he now secure to himself the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of his per∣son and property? To pretend to rise up in opposition to this riotous, injurious and rapacious rout alone, and to en∣deavour to assert &amp; defend his right against them, will most certainly prove an insignificant attempt; and will serve no other purpose than to convince him of the impossibi∣lity of it. But shall the man suffer any injuries upon his person, and seizure of his property, which this a∣bandoned crew shall please, and be quiet? O Heavens! does not every spark of humanity and pity catch fire, and quick enkindle in every generous breast at the ve∣ry thought of such cruelty and injustice! certainly this is most disagreeable to all principles of natural justice, righteousness and equity, if there be any such thing ex∣isting any where. But how can the man prevent his suf∣fering in such sort? to pretend a redress, or to make re∣prisals alone, we see will not be significant of any thing but folly and madness. And if he should by a pathetic exposition of his case to others, by prayers and tears, and the most powerful persuasions and entreaties he can use, gain some assistance from his neighbours; if this should prove insufficient and unavailable, he will certainly be left in as bad, likely a worse situation than he was in be∣fore: Perhaps he will so enrage the injurious and des∣perate multitude, as will excite them to commit still greater injuries and mischiefs. If he should gain a num∣ber sufficient to resist and repel all the assaults and in∣vasions of these unjust wretches, or to make just reprisals for the injuries and rapines already commited, who does not see that this will presently issue in the total destruction and extirpation of all the people?</P>
<P>I NEED to say no more, one would think, to convince every intelligent and considerate man of this great truth, a people cannot live in society without civil govern∣ment of some kind and form or other. It is not at all to the present purpose, to enquire what kind or form of civil government, whether Aristocratical, Democratical, Mo∣narchial, Republican, or any other particular kind,
<PB N="14" REF="014036_0014_0F92ACD11CF1CA40"/>
be best, or even good to be erected among a people, Some kind or form of civil government there must be, or no man will be quiet and secure in the enjoyment of ei∣ther his person or his property.</P>
<P>AND in a civil state, 'tis evident to every one, there must be some appointed to make laws, others to execute them; and for this end and others, there must be a sub∣ordination of rulers, both in legislative and executive trust; some superior, and others inferior: And if there be one supreme, one who shall hold the balance of pow∣er, for 'tis evident it must be held somewhere, and if this be agreed upon, this is perhaps the best. Power to make and execute laws for the general utility and e∣molument of the state, must be put in the hands of some men, of rulers and officers in subordination as above, For 'tis for the good of the state and people, that every one and the whole community, may enjoy their per∣sons and properties free of all molestations, invasions, rapines and invasions whatsoever, that civil government is erected; and these great ends must be kept in sight and direct.</P>
<P>THE great enquiry here is, who shall set up this ci∣vil government? who shall make rulers supreme and sub∣ordinate? and invest them with power and authority to make and execute laws for the good of the people? Our proposition asserts that a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and constitute a king supreme and all subordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and safety. And this is my reply, the people have right to set up a civil government, the people have right to make rulers supreme and subordinate, and the people have right to invest them with power and authority to make and execute laws, such as shall be promotive of their good, liberty, protection, peace, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IF the preliminary observations which have been made above be true and just, and be now adverted to, and carefully considered, every one may see the proof of this proposition to be very plain and easy, almost at first view.
<PB N="15" REF="014036_0015_0F92ACD1E3D9BFE8"/>
But that I may not be wanting in the full and complete proof of this point; let us suppose A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. a large number of men, yet in a state of nature▪ and without any civil government. Now 'tis very plain to every one, from what hath been said already, that each of these, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. has an inherent, in∣dividual right to his own person and personal properties, and to all his estate and acquisitions, and to defend and secure to himself the enjoyment of them, free from all molestations and disquiet. It hath just been proved that this cannot be done without civil government. Here it would be very vain and futile to plead, that the power and authority which God and nature have given to pa∣rents and masters will answer all the ends of civil go∣vernment, or serve to secure each individual in the quiet enjoyment of his own person and property. Just as fu∣tile would it be to mention the Adamic, Noachal, patri∣archal, Abrahamic, &amp;c. powers and authorities, whate∣ver they were, or over whom, or after what manner soever they were exercised, which I shall not here spend time to ascertain—I say, just as futile would it be to mention these as any argument to prove that the whole society in gene∣ral, or that each individual in particular, has not an in∣dividual right to his person and property, and so a right to defend them, and secure to himself the enjoyment of them, and consequently a right to be active in erecting a civil government, as I shall immediately shew that he has.</P>
<P>NOW, if these things be so, if every individual, in a state of nature, has an individual right to his person and property, and to defend and secure to himself the enjoy∣ment of them, as hath been abundantly proved; then B has no right to A's person or property; and then he has no right to command or controul him in the use of his person or property; then surely he has no right to set up himself for a judge or ruler over A; or to place himself in any the least authority over him. For if it could be supposed that B has a right to place himself in authority over A, and to command and controul him in the use of his person and property, and to make laws by which A
<PB N="16" REF="014036_0016_0F92ACD2ABCE85F8"/>
shall be governed in the enjoyment of his own person and property, this would be to give B a right to A's per∣son and property: for to exercise authority and dominion, to make and execute laws for the government of others, supposeth him who doth this, to have a very great right, both to the persons and properties of those for whom he doth it. For all right of dominion and authority is founded in property; this is an eternal verity. But to suppose B to have any right to A's person or property is directly contrary to our prime supposition, and to what hath been sufficiently proved already. B has then no right to command or controul A in the use of his person and property, or to exercise any, the least authority over him imaginable, or to put himself into any place of power or government with respect to A. And what is true of B, is so of C, D, or any other; none of them have any right to the person or property of A, or A of any of them; con∣sequently neither of them has any right to exercise any power or authority over, or to command or controul ano∣ther, in the use of his person or property.</P>
<P>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. can neither of them be in civil trust, power and authority over any other, in the whole series, of natural society: They must eter∣nally remain in a state of nature, each one <HI>sui juris</HI> un∣less by mutual consent, covenant and compact, they raise some of their number, into places of public trust, power and authority, and so make them rulers supreme and subordinate. No man, or number of men under Heaven, has right to dispute the power of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. to make them rulers, and set up a civil government, if they please, how they please, and when they please; or their power to invest their rulers with such authorities legislative and executive as they please. For this would be to give this man or number of men a right to the persons of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. and to their properties too; contrary to our supposition and the truth.</P>
<P>THE people then, in every natural society, and they only, have right natural and inherent, to set up a civil
<PB N="17" REF="014036_0017_0F92ACD4D24CDC38"/>
Government. And this is the inherent and natural right of every tribe nation and people under heaven; they, the people only, can make a civil government, set up rulers supreme and subordinate, determine what laws they will be governed by, and what mode of go∣vernment shall take place, even that which upon tryal proves the best; to promise the most liberty, protec∣tion, peace and safety to the people. If there be any people or nation upon this globe, (and I shall not dis∣pute but there is) that have not and do not exercise such right as this, this is evidently preternatural, and mere∣ly accidental, or rather tyrannic and despotic, contrary to reason and justice, and abhorent from all principles of natural righteousness and equity, dreadful and into∣lerable to any people, who are awake and sensible of those natural rights which God hath given to all people, without any exception.</P>
<P>THESE rights of the people have been espoused, as∣serted and vindicated in all ages of the world, as might be abundantly shewn from history, both sacred and pro∣fane, and the contrary principles as warmly denied and disproved.</P>
<P>THE Hebrew government, as ordained of God, seems to have consisted of three parts or branches. For all Is∣rael were very antiently divided into tribes, and each tribe had its own civil, as well as military officers; for there were heads of families, princes, rulers, elders and courts within each tribe. There was also a number of chosen men, of chief wisdom and integrity, consisting of about seventy persons. And lastly, there was a su∣preme magistrate, in both civil and military affairs, only subordinate to Jehovah, who was called judge, captain, &amp;c. such we find were Joshua, Gideon, Sampson, Jeph∣tha, &amp;c. Now these officers, heads of families, elders, &amp;c. together with the whole assembly or congregation of all Israel, ever chose and raised to power and authority their chief ruler, judge or Captain; never was one elected without the consent of all the people.</P>
<P>WE must note by the way, that no judge, ruler or
<PB N="18" REF="014036_0018_0F92ACD50D7C1278"/>
king, nor all the congregation of Israel, had a proper power or authority of legislation, or making of laws, or of annulling any already made; this was a power en∣tirely in the hands of Jehovah, who was Israel's supreme King and Legislator.</P>
<P>BUT even Jehovah himself, the sovereign Lord of all worlds, the great proprietor of universal nature, did not see it fit to assume to himself the regency and su∣preme civil government of Israel without their consent and election of him. An everlasting convincing evidence of the truth of what I have above observed, concerning the rights of the people. Exod. xix. 3,—9. And Mo∣ses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel, ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar trea∣sure unto me above all people: For all the earth is mine. And ye shall be unto me a KINGDOM of priests, and an holy NATION. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. Thus Jehovah himself, when he was about to make a kingdom of Is∣rael, and assume the regency over it, in his own infinite person, propounds to them the form of the kingdom, and what they should swear to be, and perform, as his loyal subjects, upon their choice of him for their poli∣tic head and sovereign.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, Moses came and called for all the elders of Israel, and laid before their faces all these words which Jehovah commanded him. Here Moses summonses a parliament of all Israel, calls all the princ∣es of the tribes, head of families, and captains, or mi∣litary officers, and the whole representative body of the Hebrew nation, and lays before them the oath of allegi∣ance; and here all Israel thus represented, swore fealty to Jehovah, as their lawful sovereign; as it follows in the next words:
<Q>And all the people answered toge∣ther
<PB N="19" REF="014036_0019_0F92ACD62D15CF20"/>
and said, all that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto Jehovah.</Q></P>
<P>IN the government of Athens there was an assembly very like this of the Hebrews, which was usually called Ecclesia; in which all matters of importance concerning the state, were proposed for their consideration and ap∣probation or disapprobation, when they were lawfully summoned, as were the Hebrews here by Moses. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Est autem conscio populi conventus legitime advocatus, rei alicujus publicoe causa, suffragio suo, aut jubendae, aut ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andoe. Sigonicus de Rep. Athen▪ as I find him quoted.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Lacedemonians also had a like assembly or con∣gregation, for like purposes, and called by the same name, Ecclesia; in distinction from a lesser congregati∣on, consisting of those whose habitations was in the city of Sparta, (called Mikra Ecclesia.)</P>
<P>SUCH were also the rights and privileges of the peo∣ple in congregation, in Africa; particularly in the con∣gregation of the people who went from Tyre and settled in Carthage. We may therefore very reasonably con∣jecture that the government of the ancient Carthageni∣ans was after the Tyrian modle.</P>
<P>ALL these governments of antient Greece, Italy, Africa, and Asia too, may very much assist us to gain a right and true notion of these Hebrew assemblies or con∣gregations; which we find had existence in the old state of that nation, as it was modled by Moses, at the com∣mand of Jehovah.</P>
<P>WHEN Joshua was to be appointed to succeed Moses, God commanded Moses to take Joshua and set him be∣fore the people, before Eleazer the priest, and the whole congregation, the whole representative of the Hebrew nation, for their approbation and election. Num. xxviii, 18. And after Moses had thus proposed the matter to a legitimate assembly of all Israel, they give their consent that Joshua should be their Judge or Captain; and when they beheld that he was possessed of a like spirit with Moses, and therefore that he was a fit and proper per∣son
<PB N="20" REF="014036_0020_0F92ACD690011B60"/>
to take upon him the government of Israel, in sub∣ordination to Jehovah their supreme Magistrate, and in the stead of Moses. Deut. xxxiv.9. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of Wisdom: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.</P>
<P>SOME great men have supposed, and perhaps not without good reason, that Saul the first King of Israel was chosen by a ballot. But be that as it may, 'tis plain to every one, that Saul was made King at the free e∣lection of the people. For when Samuel set him before the people, and said, see ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, they all shouted aloud and said, God save the King. I. Sam. x.24. When some of the people ex∣pressed a little uneasiness at Saul's election, and said, how shall this man save us? Samuel warns an assembly of all Israel, to be holden at Gilgal, to see if the people could not be eased. And the people met ac∣cording to warning at Gilgal, and there they made Saul King before the Lord. I. Sam. x.27.xi.14, 15.</P>
<P>SOLOMON was anointed King by Zadoch the priest, and Nathan the prophet, at Gihon by the order of Da∣vid his father. Yet notwithstanding this, Solomon must be chosen and proclaimed King by the people, and therefore he is proposed to them:
<Q>And they made So∣lomon the son of David King the second time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief Governor: And so Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as King instead of David his father, and prospered, and all Is∣rael obeyed him: And all the princes and the mighty men, and all the sons also of King David submitted themselves unto Solomon the King. I. Chron. xxix.22, 23, 24.</Q></P>
<P>HOW directly contrary to truth and fact, do these men talk, who say, that Kings derive their authority from God only! I assert, there never was one King upon this Globe, that derived his authority from God only. Let those who assert that Kings derive their authority from God only, be so ingenious as to prove
<PB N="21" REF="014036_0021_0F92ACD7411E50E0"/>
that there ever was any one upon earth that did so: Let them tell us who he was, and where he reigned. When this shall be done, I will ingeniously retract what I have said; but I must beg leave to maintain my integrity until that time.</P>
<P>TIS true, Saul and David were nominated to the kingdom, and Joshua successor to Moses, to be Judge over Israel by God: But Joshua as we have shown, was chosen by the people. And we have not the least rea∣son to think that either Saul or David would have reign∣ed over Israel, had they not been elected by the peo∣ple. For tho' Saul had been nominated by Jehovah, to be King, and anointed by Samuel to be Captain over God's inheritance, the people of Israel; yet he must be acknowledged to be king, and proclaimed by the peo∣ple; and was so at Mizpeh. But still, as there seemed to be some little uneasiness among some of the people, Saul could not be settled upon the throne of Israel until this uneasiness subsided, and all the people were made quiet. Samuel therefore, who well understood the rights of the people, must have all Israel together at Gilgal, that there might be a mutual and universal consent a∣mong the people, and a perfect acquiescence in Saul as King.</P>
<P>AND all the people made Saul King themselves, and they and he came to a mutual agreement, that he should be their King, and they his Subjects; and they re∣joiced heartily together. Had it not been for this mu∣tual agreement between Saul and the people, Saul might have fed his fathers asses to the day of his death, for any thing we know to the contrary.</P>
<P>And David tho' he was anointed to be King by Sa∣muel at God's command, at Bethlehem, must be a∣nointed again, and acknowledged to be King by the people. There must be a covenant made between Da∣vid and the people, before he could mount the throne. So all the Elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron; and King David made a league with them in Hebron
<PB N="22" REF="014036_0022_0F92ACD7E1632268"/>
before the Lord. And they anointed David King over Israel. II. Sam. v.3.</P>
<P>THUS, there have been some Kings of Israel made so both by God and the people, yet never one by God only. And in all the nations of the earth, Kings have ever been made so by the people only. Nor does God ever make a King over any people, any other ways than he does all things that are done in the universe. Just so far from truth is it to say that Kings derive their au∣thority from God only, as to assert a thing to have cer∣tainly been, which certainly never had existence.</P>
<P>THAT all nations have ever looked upon themselves to have a natural and undoubted right to make their own Kings, is evident from these two things, that they have ever asserted and claimed such right; and because they always groaned and uttered bitter complaints when they could not enjoy and exercise such right.</P>
<P>CICERO de Offic. l. 2. as I find, is thus translated by Sir Roger L'Estrange, p. 101, 102. Heroclotus tells us, that the Medians chose their Kings originally for the probity of their manners, and in hopes of enjoying the benefits of common justice.</P>
<P>IN the kingdom of Persia, after the junction of the kingdoms of Media and Persia, which was as much of a monarchy as any almost in those times, the Nobility and Governors of provinces, the representative body of that nation, supposed themselves to have right to make their Kings, change successions, raise up whom they would to royal dignity, &amp;c. &amp;c. did actually exercise such powers when the succession to the throne did not please them, or was not for the good and happi∣ness of the kingdom. This is evident from many in∣stances in the history of that kingdom. To cite but one at this time. After the death of Artaxerxes, the Nobi∣lity and Governors of provinces, who were disgusted exceedingly with the cruelty and wretched management of Sogdianus, revolted from him, and went over to Ochus, and having put the royal liara upon his head,
<PB N="23" REF="014036_0023_0F92ACD89C3947E0"/>
declared him King. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prid. Connect. Vol. II. <HI>580.</HI> to this effect.</NOTE> This did the Nobility and Go∣vernors of Provinces, for the good of the kingdom of Persia.</P>
<P>THERE was a general council gathered in all the states and free cities of Greece, in which was lodged a power of choosing their own Kings, as well as command∣ers in war, as any one may find if he will. This is evi∣dent from what Alexander did after the death of his fa∣ther Philip, for he summoned this very council, and pro∣cured to be chosen by them, the successor to his father in the same command.</P>
<P>EVERY one that knows ever so little about their his∣tory, knows that all the civil and military officers, both supreme and subordinate, in the Roman state, were cho∣sen by the suffrages of the senate and people of Rome, and the army.</P>
<P>CAESAR and Tacitus describe the antient Britons to have been a fierce people; zealous of liberty: a free people; not like the Gauls, governed by laws made by great men; but by the people. In Caesar's time they chose Capivallaunces, and afterwards Carastacus, Arvira∣gus, Galgacus, and others, to command them in their wars, but they retained the government in themselves.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lord Sommers, <HI>45.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>IN the beginning of the 5th century, when the empe∣ror Honorius reigned, the Romans withdrew from the island of Britain, and left it, carrying away with them all the forces, and leaving the kingdom open to the invasions and ravages of the Picts and Scots; upon which the Bri∣tons elected several Kings one after another, who were deposed almost as soon as chosen; till finally they chose Vortigern, who reigned a long time. Such was their zeal for liberty, and so tenacious were the worthy ances∣tors of the present Britons of their darling rights and pri∣vileges, that when the Saxons who had been invited over by them, found means to quarrel with them, and made an entire conquest of the whole kingdom, except Wales and Cornwall, they fled thither for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ty, and would not
<PB N="24" REF="014036_0024_0F92ACD95863F520"/>
be subjected, as to the main part of them, to tyrannic and despotic power.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR Meveray, as I find him quoted, gives this account of the manners and powers of the ancient Ger∣mans. There were, if I mistake not, three sorts of go∣vernment among the Germans. In some places the peo∣ple had the principal authority, and yet they often elected a Prince or a King; sometimes a General whom we call Duke, from the Latin word <HI>Dux.</HI> But the power of these chiefs descended entirely on the community, or people; so that it was always a mixed democracy. In other parts, among the Gothones, the King's reigned with more power; yet not to the detriment of liberty; their royalty was limited by laws and the reason of things. As for li∣berty, no people were ever so jealous of it, or ever defend∣ed it so long, and so successfully as the Germans,</P>
<P>IT may indeed be said, that liberty, being driven out of the best part of the world by the Roman arms, took refuge on the further side of the Rhine; where she had for her companions and guards, poverty, innocence, fru∣gality and modesty; and where, in the fastnesses of woods and morasses, sometimes on the defensive, and sometimes making couragious sallies, she combatted five hundred years together, against tyranny and all her train; I mean ambition, luxury, voluptuousness, flattery, corruption and divisions; the instruments which that cruel enemy of the human race employs to forge manacles and fetters.</P>
<P>THUS in ancient Palestine, Media, Persia, Tyre, Afri∣ca, Greece, Rome, Briton and Germany, the people con∣sidered themselves as possessed of the rights and privileges of choosing their own rulers and officers supreme and sub∣ordinate, civil and military. These great and inestima∣ble rights they viewed as the free donation of God and nature, and used them in the general: and when they were not prevented by tyrannic and despotic powers, by invasions and conquests, which they could not avoid, and under which they suffered and mourned so long as they lasted. And thus we find that history both sacred and profane establishes this truth, that those principles have
<PB N="25" REF="014036_0025_0F92ACDA191CD540"/>
generally been wrought into practice in the kingdoms and nations of the earth, which nature and her God have so deeply laid, and on which the darling rights and privi∣leges of the people depend, and by which they are sup∣ported.</P>
<P>'TIS very true, Jehovah is the intelligent and glorious author of nature, and the natural governor of the universe, and none can dispute his authority to deal with kingdoms and their Kings as he shall please; he may set up one, and pull down on other at his will; he may raise to re∣gal dignity and honour the men whom he chuses, and dethrone others at his supreme good pleasure. But 'tis as true, that he never yet saw fit, in his infinite wisdom and counsels, to use this his undoubted power: he never hath, in all the ages and generations of men upon the earth, set up one King over any people or nation of his own entire authority, and without the voluntary election of that people or nation. He hath, both in his word and his providence, always allowed the people a voice in all elections of their civil and military officers and rulers. This liberty he allowed to that people whom he chose in a peculiar sense, to be their God, and also their Saviour and Deliverer. Nor would he himself assume the regen∣cy and government of that favoured people, without their consent and free election. For when he was about to take upon himself the kingly office, and to preside over Israel as their politic head and legislator he gave com∣mandment to Moses to lay the matter before the people, and to acquaint them with his design; to shew them the terms of the covenant, or political league which they were to make, for their future government under his supreme authority. Israel in full parliament assembled solemnly declare their consent to these terms, and swear allegiance to Jehovah as their King, and thus he became seated upon the throne of Israel. And this same Jehovah who was thus chosen himself, and seated upon the throne of Israel by the people, hath ordered it so in his pro∣vidence, that people and nations have generally enjoyed their natural rights in this respect, that they have made
<PB N="26" REF="014036_0026_0F92ACDB1300D288"/>
their own Kings, tho' he hath sometimes for wise and holy ends, permitted tyranny and oppression to rivet their hateful and galling chains upon the necks of the people, to the detriment of these natural rights and privileges.</P>
<P>THOSE men who can plead that Kings derive their authority and right to reign over the people from God on∣ly, are either grossly ignorant, and so ought not to say any thing about this matter; or they can plead for any thing, just as it shall coincide with their particular hu∣mours, or their despotic principles; and so are not worthy to be heard, tho' they say ever so much, by any man who has a sacred regard to truth and righteousness, natural justice and equity.</P>
<P>WE may, I humbly think, conclude that our propo∣sition is true, and that a people have a natural and inhe∣rent right to appoint and constitute a King supreme, and all subordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and safety.</P>
<P>THUS having shewn the people's powers and privi∣leges in entering into civil state, in constituting a King a supreme ruler, and all in subordination to him in civil trust and power: I pass,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO SHEW what are the duties and obligations of a King erected by the people, as he ought to be, and of all subordinate civil rulers and officers.</P>
<P>KINGS and people, rulers and ruled, are co-relatives, and the relation subsisting between them, necessarily in∣fers, or supposes several duties mutually incumbent up∣on them: Duties incumbent upon Kings and rulers to∣wards the people, and those over whom and for whom they rule; and likewise duties incumbent upon the peo∣ple, those who are ruled, towards their Kings, and all who rule over them. My immediate business is, to shew what are the several duties incumbent upon the Kings and all civil rulers towards the people, and those over whom and for whom they rule. And here I shall not presume to mention all the duties and obligations lying upon Kings and all civil rulers towards the people, but
<PB N="27" REF="014036_0027_0F92ACDF5C248760"/>
shall content myself with mentioning some of the more important and obvious of them.</P>
<P>THESE more important and obvious duties and obli∣gations lying upon Kings and all civil rulers and officers, you have in the following propositions and reasonings.</P>
<P N="1">I. KINGS and all civil rulers and officers are obliged and bound to use their utmost endeavours in the due ex∣ertion of that power, and the fulfilment of that trust reposited with them, to defend and secure to the people the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their persons and properties.</P>
<P>BY properties of the people I mean, all those worldly goods, estates and chattles which they have gotten by their honest labour, industry and frugality; together with all those just privileges and advantages they have to acquire more by labour, industry, trade, com∣merce, manufactures, &amp;c. Now, that Kings and all ci∣vil rulers and officers are obliged and bound to defend and secure to the people the quiet and unmolested en∣joyment of their persons, and these properties is a plain truth, and very easily made evident to every one.</P>
<P>THIS is a plain truth, because this is the very end and design, or at lead one very principal end and design, of their being, as civil rulers. The people really design∣ed when they raised them to places of public trust and authority, that they should exert all that power and au∣thority they gave them, to defend and secure to them the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their persons and properties; <HI>i. e.</HI> of their persons and all their worldly goods, estates and chattles, which they had gotten by fatigue, labour and industry; and also of all those pri∣vileges and advantages which they justly had to get more worldly goods, and greater estates; such as labour, in∣dustry, trade, commerce, &amp;c. This I say was one ve∣ry principal design the people had in view, when they raised some men to places of public trust and authority, and entered into civil estate, and civil, mutual covenants, compacts and associations. 'Tis very plain in reason, and even in common sense, that this must be one main
<PB N="28" REF="014036_0028_0F92ACE15931AD30"/>
end, one principal design at least, (for I shall presently shew they must have had others) which the people had a view to, when they entered into civil state, and made them civil rulers, and gave them the civil sword, with proper power and authority to wield it. And this may appear most evidently thus. Suppose A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. a large number of people in neighbourhood together, in some part of this globe; and to have acquired by honest labour, industry, frugality and com∣merce with one another, very considerable estates; and to be under very good advantages to get more estate and worldly goods, if they could live quietly and peaceably in the enjoyment of their persons and present acquisiti∣ons, and of those advantages they are now under to ac∣quire more. But the injury and violence offered their persons, and the continual ravages and depredations made upon their estates, by neighbouring nations and people dwelling upon the continent, and even beyond the seas, prevent them both from the enjoyment of their persons in peace and quiet, and what acquisitions they have already made, and also from those future ac∣quisitions which an unmolested enjoyment of their ad∣vantages would assist them to make.</P>
<P>They find themselves under fatal necessity of suffering the like injuries and depredations for the future, in the circumstances they are now in, being in a state of nature, and having no one, or more, of superior power and au∣thority among them, to counsel and advise to measures proper to be taken by them, and to lead forth their united force, by his or their command, to oppose and suppress such troublers of their peace and quiet, and injurers of their persons and properties; to prevent their making such ravages, and committing such injuries for the future or to make reprisals for those already committed. And thus they become very sensible of the impossibility of their living together in such a situation with any tolerably de∣gree of quiet, safety or security, either to their persons or properties; and of the necessity of making an essenti∣al alteration in their mode of living. They are now per∣suaded
<PB N="29" REF="014036_0029_0F92ACE365634DE8"/>
that they must choose some persons from among their numbers, and raise them to places of superior trust and authority, and invest them with powers, such as shall tend to their benefit, to the effectual security, de∣fence and protection of their persons and properties, from all such injuries, foreign invasions, and depredations, as they have too sensibly suffered.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. meet to∣gether in a general assembly, confer upon their present great unhappiness in such a situation; and the probabi∣lity that it will still continue or grow greater, if they should remain thus. They finally unanimously agree to an alteration of their present manner of living, and to the election of a civil state and government, and the mak∣ing civil compacts and leagues, and effectually entering into a politic society; and these for their civil good, li∣berty, protection, peace and safety, in the enjoyment of their persons and properties without injury and ruptures. To effect which salutary purposes and designs, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. take out of their number, by general votes, or suffrages, L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. such as they judge to be eminently possessed of wisdom, equity, pro∣bity, and public spirit, qualifying them for the impor∣tant and interesting business of legislation and execution, and all the great and weighty affairs of civil govern∣ment. Of these men they make rulers and officers of supreme and subordinate authority, and to these they de∣legate a power to make and execute, from time to time, all such laws, orders and statutes, as shall be, in their best judgment, and upon proper experiment of them, the most proper and fit to promote the general good and utility; and to settle and maintain them in the quiet and just en∣joyment of their persons and properties. Always pro∣vided they retain a right and power to choose a sufficient number from among themselves, to be a representative body of the whole people, to sit in council with those they now elect into places of public trust and authority; and to have a voice in the making all such laws, as above,
<PB N="30" REF="014036_0030_0F92ACE483078B10"/>
and in the management of all the most weighty concerns of the state.</P>
<P>MANY and powerful reasons might easily be given, if it were required in this place, why any people have right and why it is a point of consummate wisdom and pru∣dence for them, always to have such a representative bo∣dy from among the commons, to sit in council with their rulers, and to have a voice in legislation. But as it is not required in this place, and is not itself a matter of the greatest contest or difference, I shall not make use of this time to give the reasons for it, but shall willingly pass it in silence.</P>
<P>Now I ask, are not L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. thus elected by the people, and raised by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. to places of public trust and power, solemnly bound and obliged, on supposition they accept of these places and this civil trust and authority, to defend and secure A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. and every individual member of this society, now a body politic, in the enjoyment of their persons and properties in peace and quiet? are they not obliged to defend and secure the people in the unmolest∣ed enjoyment of their rights, privileges, advantages and emoluments which God and nature have given them? I freely appeal to reason and the nature of things; I ap∣peal to common sense; I appeal most heartily to every one who is capable to read and understand what I write, whether this be not so.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY every man must be considered as under obligations to do what he most voluntarily covenants and engages to do; but every King, every civil ruler, when they consent to be such, in consequence of the free elec∣tion and suffrage of the people, do, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> engage and covenant to use their superior power and authority to pro∣mote the people's good, peace and happiness, and to do their utmost to secure and defend their persons and properties.</P>
<P>'Tis a well known practice, in all countries, and among all nations, where King's are elective, to use some solemn form of inauguration, in which the King swears to rule
<PB N="31" REF="014036_0031_0F92ACE4B9A63590"/>
the people by wholesome laws; and to abide by the sta∣tute laws, and the Magna Charta of the kingdom, in all those laws to which he shall give his royal assent. I have no objection to make against this. But I really suppose that a King, when he accepts of the regency, upon his election to it by the people, does, by this very acceptance, lay himself under solemn obligations to rule the people by wholesome laws, and to do all in his power to make them happy. For he knows that their happi∣ness is the design they have in view, in electing him into place of royal dignity and authority. How gross and detestable would be his hypocrisy, if he should accept of regal power and place, upon the voluntary election of the people, and yet not sincerely design to promote their good and happiness, in such exalted stations of life and actions! every King is bound to make the people's good his Magna Charta, in all his administrations.</P>
<P N="2">2. KINGS, and all civil rulers, are under obligations to defend and secure the people in the worship of the Deity, and the due observation of religion in publick; and even to exert their power and authority to oblige the people to attend upon the public worship of God.</P>
<P>I am writing and speaking in a land where the true God is known and revered, and the religion of Christ Jesus the Messias is generally acknowledged.</P>
<P>L, M, N, O P, &amp;c. are not only under obligations to defend and secure the people in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their persons and properties, i. e. their per∣sons and wordly goods and estates, &amp;c. together with all their just advantages and opportunies of getting more worldly goods, estates, &amp;c. by labour, industry, trade, manufactures, &amp;c. but they are also under obligations to protect and secure the people in the worship of the Deity; and even to exert their power and authority to oblige the people to attend upon the public worship of God with constancy and all becoming decency.</P>
<P>CIVIL magistrates ought to consider that the people have souls as well as bodies, immortal as well as tempo∣ral interests: and that they expect that those men whom
<PB N="32" REF="014036_0032_0F92ACE55AB96288"/>
they elevate into places of distinction, trust and dignity, should have some regard to their superior interest as well as to their inferior, to their eternal as well as temporal concerns. They most justly expect that their rulers fa∣vour, cherish, protect and defend them, at least whilst they worship the divinity, and attend upon religion in such manner, as is no wise detrimental, but greatly be∣neficial to the civil state; and certainly for the promoti∣on of their everlasting account with God.</P>
<P>I do not mean that the civil magistrate, as such, or purely because he is elevated above the people in his civil capacity, should therefore exert himself in the church, or have a chief care in managing the affairs of Christ's house: by no means does this belong to his character as a civil magistrate. The superior character and authority of a civil magistrate, in the politic state, give him no su∣perior power or authority in the ecclesiastical state. But I do really mean that the civil magistrate, as a man, as one bound for immortality, and even as a man elevated, and in honor and dignity, and one who is truely concern∣ed for the eternal welfare of the people, is under very great obligations to promote, nourish, defend and secure all reverential worship of God, and decent observation of religion, both natural and revealed. Thus much I sup∣pose the civil magistrate is obliged to do, in order to pro∣mote the worship of the Deity, &amp; for the due encourage∣ment of religion in general. But I say further, the civil magistrate, as such, or purely because he is in the magis∣stracy is under obligations to exert his power and autho∣ty to oblige the people to a due and regular and constant attendance upon the public worship of the church.</P>
<P>If the civil magistrate be under obligations to defend and secure to the people the enjoyment of their persons and properties, in peace and quietness, which every one will readily grant, then he is under obligations to do those things which have a direct &amp; natural tendency to promote this their enjoyment; and indeed these are very nearly the same thing. For to bring any thing into effect, and to do those things which have a natural and direct tenden∣cy
<PB N="33" REF="014036_0033_0F92ACE6398AD1D8"/>
to such effect, are very nearly the same thing: cer∣tainly there is as much relation between them, as be∣tween the means and the end effected by those means. And it may be the case, that civil magistrates may be in∣capable to do any more, than to use the best and most likely means to make the state flourish, and the peo∣ple happy. But surely, in all christian countries, a con∣stant, due and regular attendance upon the worship in public assemblies, where the great fundamental princi∣ples truths and duties of natural religion are skilfully taught and inculcated upon the people, and where the re∣ligion of Messias, in its genuine purity and simplicity, is preached, and its vast importance clearly and wisely shewn, I say, a constant and regular attendance upon this worship and service is for the civil good of the people, and an unspeakable advantage to every politic state. For in the church the people are taught their duty to God and the king, and there the most powerful arguments and motives are presented to their minds, to prevail with and persuade them to a suitable conduct towards both. More powerful and weighty arguments and motives may people receive from the desk than from the bench or the bar, the prison or the gallows, to persuade them to ren∣der all becoming obedience to civil magistrates. Per∣haps one orthodox or faithful preacher of religion may do more real service, even to the civil state, than two faithful justices of the peace, in each particular society or parish. For if the arguments fetched from the unseen state, if the eternal joys and everlasting torments of an heaven and a hell, when prudently handled, and scriptu∣rally represented to the people, will not prevail with them to render due honours and worship to the great God, and his eternal son, or to pay proper obedience and meet sub∣jection to kings and civil magistrates; 'tis very improba∣ble that any thing which they can do will be effectual to persuade them to behave well in the civil state. If all preachers of religion should be discountenanced, and all public assemblies for the worship of the Deity cease, in any christian country, there would be no such thing as
<PB N="34" REF="014036_0034_0F92ACE6D58CC4F8"/>
holding the people together in civil society, and all civil government would presently be dissolved; and anarchy and confusion, atheism and barbarity, and a dismal train of evils would soon make inroads upon the people, to their certain ruin.</P>
<P>MAGISTRATES are therefore obliged on politic princi∣ples, to defend &amp; maintain the public worship of the Deity, and a constant and regular observation of religion in public. Yea, the very same arguments that may be used to prove that civil magistrates are bound to defend and secure to the people the enjoyment of their persons and properties, as one great design and end of their being, as civil magistrates may be also used to prove that they are obliged and bound to defend and maintain the public worship of the Deity, and a due observation of religion among the people. Therefore, if any one ask me, whe∣ther I would have the magistrate make use of the civil sword, in order to oblige the people to attend constantly and regularly upon public worship, if nothing else will do this? I readily answer, I would, by all means. I really look upon the civil magistrate to be under as great obligations to use the civil sword, or to exert his authori∣ty, to oblige the people to pay a constant attendance upon public worship, as he is to use the civil sword, or to exert his authority, to oblige the people to do any thing else, that can possibly be named, of equal advantage to the civil state.</P>
<P>THUS 'tis proved that civil magistrates are under obli∣gations to defend and secure the people in the worship of the Deity; and even to use the civil sword, or exert their authority, to maintain a public observation of religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. KINGS, and all civil magistrates are most solemnly and forever bound to make all their laws agreeing with truth and reason, the laws of God and the nature of things.</P>
<P>THOUGH L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. are ever so solemnly bound and obliged to defend and secure A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. in the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their persons and properties, and all their natural and just
<PB N="35" REF="014036_0035_0F92ACE79E7AB048"/>
rights and privileges; and also to maintain the worship of the Deity, and the public observation of religion a∣mong them: yet they cannot be supposed obliged to make or execute any one law, for these or any other pur∣poses of the state, which contradicts truth, or counteracts any of the maxims and laws of reason and the nature of things, which are the laws of God. For 'tis absolutely impossible that any such laws can be binding upon the people, if made. And A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. when they entered into civil state, and choose some of their number to be their civil rulers, did not oblige those whom they thus elected into places of trust and autho∣rity, to make or execute any laws which did not tend to promote, or had a tendency to obstruct the enjoyment of their persons and properties and religion; nor did those consequently, who consented to be civil magistrates upon the election of the people, oblige themselves to any such thing. For to suppose either of these would be the grossest absurdity and contradiction. But it is now, ever hath been, and will continue to be a t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th, to the con∣summation of all things, that for civil magistrates to make or execute any laws repugnant to truth and rea∣son, to the laws of God and the nature of things, will not only be no furtherence but the greatest detriment to all civil states whatsoever. It cannot be otherwise therefore, than that all civil magistrates are solemnly and forever obliged and bound to make and execute such laws only as are agreeable with their trust and reason, the laws of God and the nature of things; for such only will tend to the peace and happiness of all civil states.</P>
<P>WHEN I say that civil magistrates are obliged to make and execute laws agreeing with the laws of God, I do not mean to maintain or even to suggest, that they are scrupulously to abide by the declarations of the bible, in all the laws they make; nor do I suppose that the bible was designed by God for a code of civil laws, or to be the magna charta of any nation under heaven. 'Tis true the civil laws of the Jewish nation are principally con∣tained in the writings of Moses, and in the old testament.
<PB N="36" REF="014036_0036_0F92ACE88C275018"/>
But it must be observed that even these did not continue to bind the Hebrews, any longer than while Jehovah was their politic head and sovereign; and that they do not, nor ever did, bind any other nation, any further than the reason of them is founded in nature, and so renders them of eternal obligation to all mankind who are acquainted with them. But what I mean is, that no laws are to be made, or enforced, which are contradictory to laws, insti∣tutions, and plain declarations of the bible which are of natural and eternal obligation.</P>
<P>Ex. Gr. laws to endemnify murderers, banditti, thieves, traitors, sacriligious persons, &amp;c. such laws would be contradictory to truth, which requires that every person &amp; thing be treated according to what it really is. Disa∣greeing with reason, which ever coincides with truth, and even impolitic, as tending to the speedy eversion and ruin of all civil government and authority whatsoever. Repugnant to God's laws in his bible, to those of them which are of natural, and so consequently of eternal obli∣gation. And contrary to the nature of the thing's taking place in every civil state, as well as in the great world of nature and providence; which requires that civil punish∣ments should be inflicted on transgressors against the civil state, bearing proportion to their crimes; and that no delinquent, ever escape unpunished.</P>
<P>THUS civil magistrates who would consult and pro∣mote the peace and happiness of the state are solemnly and forever bound to make truth and reason, the laws of God and the nature of things, their standards in making civil laws, and very scrupulously to abide by them.</P>
<P>These now mentioned are some of those many and great obligations and duties which are incumbent upon kings and all civil magistrates of supreme and subordinate rank.</P>
<P N="3">III. I SHALL now pass to shew what are the duties and obligations of the people in this civil state, to their civil rulers both supreme and subordinate, whilst they fulfil their trust, and answer their obligations to them.</P>
<P>WHILST L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. fulfil the trust re∣posited
<PB N="37" REF="014036_0037_0F92ACEC510CC2E8"/>
in them by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c▪ and exert their superior power and authority, wisdom and public spirit, to defend and secure them in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their persons and properties, natural and acquired rights, priviledges and advan∣tages; and whilst they do all that in them lies, to promote and encourage the worship of the Deity, and to maintain the public observation of religion; and make all their laws for the support of the civil state, a∣greeing with truth and reason, the laws of God, and the nature of things; I say, while civil rulers conduct themselves, and the affairs of the state thus agreeably to the great ends and purposes of their being elected and instated in their several offices and places of power and trust, there are many obligations and duties incum∣bent upon the people towards them.</P>
<P>WHILST kings, and civil rulers of all degrees of power and importance, fulfil their trust, and act a∣greeable to their obligations to the people, there are ma∣ny obligations and duties lying upon the people, which they are solemnly bound to observe and fulfil, with all care and fidelity to their rulers.</P>
<P>WHAT some of the more important of these duties and obligations of the people in civil state are, towards their civil rulers, whilst they fulfil their trust and answer their obligations to them, you may take in the following propositions and conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE people are bound in duty and interest to yield all due obedience to their civil rulers, both supreme and subordinate, whilst they are endeavouring to promote their good.</P>
<P>IT was the very design of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. in entering into civil state, and making them ci∣vil rulers, in choosing men from their number, who were famed for wisdom, probity and public spirit, to promote, defend and secure the public peace, tranqui∣lity and happiness, by the exercise of their superior wis∣dom, power and authority. Their wisdom to contrive, and their power and authority to put in execution, all
<PB N="38" REF="014036_0038_0F92ACEE524A9A18"/>
their noise, and judicious projections and plans for these noble and generous purposes and designs. But civil rulers may rack their inventions, and exercise their wis∣dom ever so much, and lay the happiest projects and schemes for the general utility, peace and prosperity of the people; yet if the people will not assist their rulers and legislators in the execution of these projects and schemes, by yielding a ready and chearful obedience to their directions and commands, the ends and designs of the people and the rulers in these projections, cannot be accomplished. The general good, peace and happiness of the people, intended by them and their rulers too, can never be attained. For it is by the assistance of the people that civil rulers bring into effect their wise plans of government; and so, if they be virtuous, wise and good rulers, as is the present supposition, effectuate the designs and purposes of the people in entering into civil state and combination, even the general emolument, liberty and se∣curity. Therefore if the people will not assist their rul∣ers and legislators, by yielding a ready and chearful o∣bedience to their commands and requirements, in order that government may be maintained, by bringing into execution those plans and projections which proceeded from the superior wisdom, integrity and public spirit of the magistrates and law-givers, and which tend to effect the public tranquility, and to promote the liberty, peace and happiness of the state; they certainly counteract their own purposes and designs, and hinder those things from taking effect, which they determined with them∣selves should take effect, when they entered into civil state, and constituted civil rulers and officers in it. So that it is very plain, that duty and interest both oblige the people to yield a ready and chearful obedience to all the wise and wholesome laws directions and commands of their civil rulers and officers.</P>
<P>CIVIL officers and executors of the laws of the ma∣gistracy, are solemnly bound to exert themselves to the utmost within their several spheres of action, to put all such laws as are calculated for the general good and hap∣piness
<PB N="39" REF="014036_0039_0F92ACEE8DB92F00"/>
of the state, into execution. They should see to it with care, that they fulfil this trust, and do what in them is, what really belongs to their several depart∣ments, to promote the general utility, peace and li∣berty of the whole. And the people are also obliged to give their assistance to the executors of laws, and to forward them in bringing into execution the laws and orders of the magistrates and legislators for the univer∣sal interest of the civil state.</P>
<P>THUS, if legislators and magistrates make wise and wholesome laws, which tend to the general good and happiness; and if the officers and executors of these laws fulfil, with great care and fidelity, their trust, by endeavouring to bring these laws into execution; and finally, if the people chearfully give their assistance, to these officers and executors of laws, and thus yield a ready obedience to their civil rulers; the state will certainly flourish; peace, tranquility and happiness will ensue, e∣very one will, most likely, enjoy his person, property and religion in undisturbed quiet; and a universal joy and gladness will reign throughout the whole community, and all will experience the salutary effects of civil soci∣ety and combination. But if otherwise, an obstruction of the progess of justice and righteousness will follow, to the inevitable ruin of the state.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE people are bound to pay a suitable respect to their civil rulers, and to maintain their honour, dignity and reputation in the state, and among all their subjects.</P>
<P>EVERY one may easily imagine that honour, dignity and reputation will have a mighty influence upon the people, whose civil rulers share largely in them. No people will very much regard those rulers who have little or no reputation among them, but are had in very low esteem. Love and respect for civil rulers will do more to gain them obedience from the people, than the power of the sword can possibly do. The sword and the power civil rulers have to wield it may destroy, maim, and take away the lives of subjects; but they will never gain the love and cordial affections of the people, like honour and
<PB N="40" REF="014036_0040_0F92ABC7976AB488"/>
esteem, and consequently not their ready and chearful obedience. The former may, and undoubtedly do, make a great many political hypocrites, but few cordial and loyal subjects. It will be hard work, and a forbidding task, for civil rulers to press their way through, and gain obedience to their laws and mandates, from a people whose hearts and hands are no further with them, than mere force and constraint, the power of the sword, and the awful dread of the whip, the prison and the gallows compel them. But love, esteem, and veneration for ci∣vil rulers will sweetly constrain the people to yield a dutiful compliance with all those laws and injunctions of the magistrates, which are calculated for the general benefit of the state.</P>
<P>IT must then be the incumbent duty of all the people, to endeavour that the honour and reputation of civil rulers and magistrates be maintained among the subjects. For we have observed before, that it is for the general good, peace, safety, liberty and happiness of the community, that civil government is ever set up among a people, and civil leagues, compacts and combinations entered into by them. But these things can never be effected, the good, peace, safety, &amp;c. of the community will never be brought about, unless there be a free and impartial exer∣cise of justice and righteousness among the people. And this cannot be; a free and impartial exercise of justice and righteousness can never take place, unless good and wholesome laws for this purpose can be brought into ex∣ecution among the people. Nor can this be done; laws, though ever so wisely calculated for the universal good, peace, &amp;c. of the community, can never be put in due execution, unless the people in general have their hearts and hands with the magistrates, and will join with them in putting their laws in execution. But neither will this be unless the people honour and revere the magistrates, and have them in suitable esteem and veneration. That magistrates and civil rulers, both supreme and subordi∣nate, be honourable and reputable among the people, must be concluded to be for the general utility and pros∣perity
<PB N="41" REF="014036_0041_0F92ABCBA3D7F2F8"/>
of the state; if they are wise, prudent and faithful men. Every lover of his county, and of it's liberty, peace and prosperity, will do his endeavour to maintain the honour and reputation of all good civil rulers and magistrates.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE people are under obligations to give their ru∣lers and civil magistrates a valuable reward for the ser∣vice and work which they do for the state.</P>
<P>THE reason and nature of things, the universal custom and practice of all nations, and the word of God, most plainly shew it to be just that tribute should be paid to Caesar: that King's, and all civil rulers and magistrates should have a reasonable reward for their faithful service for the people. For when a people enter into civil state, and make choice of some of their number qualified to rule, and put them into places of public trust and au∣thority, give them power to make and execute laws for their good and advantage, for their security, peace and protection in the enjoyment of their persons and proper∣ties and religion; they very justly expect that these men, whom they have made their rulers and legislators, guar∣dians and protectors, should spend a considerable pro∣portion of their time to consult the interest of the state, to make and execute laws, to concert and prosecute the wisest and best methods and plans of government, to send and receive embassies, to determine concerning peace and war with other powers and states, to settle and re∣gulate trade and commerce, &amp;c. The people, I say, do expect and really look upon it as necessary, that their rulers should spend a great part of their time, and exer∣cise their wisdom and skill, in these services for the state for them.</P>
<P>NOW, if rulers and legislators are faithful to the peo∣ple, their constituents, and improve their time and abi∣lities for the good of the state; it is certainly highly rea∣sonable they should have a valuable consideration for it, made them by the people for whom they serve. The people are continually receiving benefits, and reaping innumerable profits and emoluments, whilst their rulers
<PB N="42" REF="014036_0042_0F92ABCDA76C3190"/>
and magistrates are diligently and faithfully employing their time and talents to protect, defend and make them happy, in the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their persons and properties, their liberties and privileges both natural and acquired. Surely they will not think it hard and unreasonable, that their rulers and magistrates should reap some of these profits, and taste some of these sweets of society with them! yea, it would be directly contrary to truth, to reason and justice, if they should de∣ny them a handsome maintenance and support for their services.</P>
<P>'TIS impossible any men should be made civil rulers and magistrates without their own consent and agree∣ment: and it is altogether improbable that any number of men should consent to improve their time and talents for the advantage and in the service of others, for no con∣siderable reward at all: and if they should, it is very manifestly unreasonable, that the people should receive their services and labours, and reap unknown advantages and benefits by them, and in return, make them no va∣luable consideration.</P>
<P>For one man to use the time and talents of another as his own, or in his own service, and for his own purposes and designs, when they are not his own would be a plain and palpable contradiction to truth. For his actions would most evidently declare that the time and talents of another man were his own, when indeed they were not: a gross violation of sacred truth! so that it is a plain and open contradiction of truth, for any people to elect men into places of public trust and authority, and use them as rulers, legislators and executors, except they give them a valuable consideration for their services. This would contradict truth also another way; for it would be a pub∣lic declaration that the time and talents of those men, whom they should elect, &amp;c. were not their own, when they really are, in nature and reason.</P>
<P>AND if any number of men should consent that their time, talents and abilities should be improved for the service of the state, it is a plain case to every one, that it
<PB N="43" REF="014036_0043_0F92ABCEB84BE550"/>
would be unreasonable in the state to employ them for nothing. For every man, by the laws of nature and reason, is justly entitled to the use and improvement of his own: if therefore he use his own powers and abilities, time and talents in the service, and for the advantage of others, it must be reasonable that he have a reward, of those men for whom he uses them. 'Tis therefore the duty of the people, and what they are under obligations to do, to give their kings and all supreme and subordinate civil rulers, a valuable reward for their services to the state.</P>
<P>IF any one should ask me, how much a king, or any other civil magistrate, ought to have of the people? I would tell him, that I shall be under better advantages to answer him, when he shall tell me, who is the man, he would have made a king, what are his talents of mind, what his natural and acquired abilities, what are his wis∣dom and skill in the affairs of government, of what in∣tegrity, faithfulness, probity and public spirit he is pos∣sess'd of, and what are all the circumstances of his person and family, and all those of the whole kingdom, over which he is to rule, and what are their expectations from him, &amp;c. Until all this, and perhaps much more, be done, I shall freely tell such an enquirer, I am incapable to solve his question: nor can I give him much encouragement that I shall be able to answer him, when he shall have taken pains to give me all this information.</P>
<P>IT is evident to any man, who thinks ever so little of the matter, that a great number of particulars must be taken into consideration, in order to determine how large a king's, or magistrates salary ought to be. If he be a man of a capacious mind, of surprising natural and ac∣quired abilities, of great skill and wisdom in the laws of nature and nations, if he be possessed of eminent piety and virtue, of great integrity, faithfulness, probity and be∣nevolence, it is apparently reasonable, that this man, if he would be persuaded to undertake the important and interesting trust of governing, and to exercise his abili∣ties, to use his time and talents for the good and benefit of the public, ought to receive a very valuable consider∣ation
<PB N="44" REF="014036_0044_0F92ABCF35266A30"/>
of the people. Because there is the greatest rea∣son to expect he will govern well, and make the com∣munity easy and quiet, peaceable and happy, in the en∣joyment of their persons, properties and religion, and all their natural rights, privileges and endowments. Where∣as a man of less abilities, emoluments and qualificati∣ons, for government, may very reasonably be contented with a less salary of the people: because there is not the like probability that he will equally promote the interest of the civil community, by his service.</P>
<P>BUT I shall very willingly let this matter rest here, without any positive decision of mine, it being a little foreign from my present design; and proceed in what is more agreeable to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'TIS a duty incumbent upon the people to pray for their civil rulers, that the great ruler and governor of universal existence, would be pleased to bless them with piety and virtue, wisdom and benevolence; and crown all their labours for the public utility with abundant success; and they ought to bless God for good rulers.</P>
<P>ANY people who consult their own best interest, and desire that the civil state may flourish and be happy; and who pay any religious regard to Jehovah, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and of whose king∣dom there is no end, and who ruleth over all with right∣ful and uncontroulable empire; will direct their warm and pathetic addresses to him, that he would look with favouring and propitious eye upon their rulers, and their state. That he would grant to those, whom they have dignified by electing them into places of public trust and authority and devolving upon them the chief management of the most important affairs of the state, abundant measures of piety and virtue, wisdom and skill to rule, possess them with great probity, benevo∣lence and public spirit, with a becoming zeal for his glory, and for the best civil and sacred interests of the community: And that he would bless and favour all their endeavours to promote the peace, happiness, li∣berty and tranquility of the civil state.</P>
<P>MOST surely such religious addresses as these to the
<PB N="45" REF="014036_0045_0F92ABCFF7B59CA8"/>
Divinity, the great eternal and glorious author of nature, and the natural governor of the world, are not unbecom∣ing any people, who believe his being and attributes, and look upon his blessing as necessary to the prosperity and happiness of any community.</P>
<P>IF any people therefore wish for the prosperity of the civil state, and desire that the ease and pains, la∣bours and services, of the civil rulers, may be suc∣cessful for this purpose, let them see to it, that they sincerely and faithfully perform their duty to their rulers, and pray with all becoming decency, reverence and fer∣vour, for Jehovah's blessing upon them.</P>
<P>THIS is not only a duty of natural light and religion, which is enough to induce an obligation for the per∣formance of it, upon every serious and virtuous man: But christians must consider, that it is an express com∣mand of inspiration, and found in the law of Messias, that they pray for Kings, and all in authority, that, under their wise and faithful administrations, they may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and ho∣nesty. Christians are then under double obligations to perform this duty to civil magistrates; obligations aris∣ing from the law and light of nature and reason, and receiving additional force and authority from sacred re∣velation. One would be apt to think it an easy matter to persuade a christian people of this great obligation ly∣ing upon them, to pray for Kings and all in authority.</P>
<P>BUT a people ought also to bless God for all good ci∣vil rulers, such as consult his glory, and their best good and happiness, and endeavour by all reasonable and righteous methods of administration, to promote the ci∣vil felicity.</P>
<P>I DO not mean that a people are obligated to bless God for good rulers, as tho' they were appointed to preside over them, and instated in their offices and digni∣ties by his sole authority: for I do not believe there ever was, yea, I know there never was, any one King, or civil ruler, appointed and instated in civil power, over any people under heaven, by God's sole authority. And I most firmly believe it to be contrary to reason
<PB N="46" REF="014036_0046_0F92ABD0A28D1F90"/>
and the nature of things, I know it to be contrary to the law of nature and nations, to sacred and profane his∣tory, to believe or hold any such opinion, that Kings derive their authority to reign over the people from God only. I shall not therefore direct any people to offer praise and thanksgiving to God, under any such con∣sideration as this. But as God's providence directs the affairs of universal existence, concerns itself for the good and happiness of kingdoms and states, as it superintends all the greater and meaner events that take place in the whole system of beings, so that not so insignificant a thing as a sparrow, or even an hair of our heads, falls to the ground, without his knowledge and inspection; when he, in his good and superintending providence, permits and directs to the election of wise and good Kings and civil rulers, it very highly becomes the peo∣ple suitably to acknowledge his hand, and to pay pro∣per respect to the power that rules above, and governs in this lower world, that he hath directed them to the choice of good and faithful kings, of wise and righteous magistrates. Thus much I can heartily and patheti∣cally recommend to all civil communities of people, who are thus favoured in God's holy and good provi∣dence, in this interesting regard.</P>
<P>I WOULD therefore, with all due engagedness, ear∣nestness and fervour, recommend it to all people who have wise and faithful rulers, that they devoutly pay to the great ruler of the world, suitable acknowledg∣ments, for his care of, and goodness to them: and that they pray to this great being, for his blessing upon them, that they may be possessed of real piety and vir∣tue, wisdom and probity, and every magisterial qua∣lification: and that he would crown all their labours and endeavours for the public weal with abundant suc∣cess: that so, they may be a rich and lasting blessing to the people over whom they rule; and the state be happy, enjoying the sweets of civil combination, and relishing the benefits of Heaven's indulgence. Having now fi∣nished three of those things at first propounded to be discussed, I shall directly pass to the consideration of the fourth and last proposition, viz.</P>

TO PROVE that the people have right and au∣thority to dethrone their king, and put down all other civil officers and rulers, of subordinate degree, when∣ever they shall counteract their obligations, and cease to answer the ends of their constitution and appoint∣ment to places of civil trust and power.</P>
<P>THIS is a proposition, the truth of which is very ea∣sily proved and made evident, and which, it seems, eve∣ry man who is capable, and does seriously and impar∣tially weigh the natural rights and privileges of man∣kind, the truth, justice and reason of things, would rea∣dily acknowledge.</P>
<P>BUT as this is a matter of very great importance, which labours in the minds of some of the less thinking part of men, and is denied to be truth by others, tho' as I think, in the very face of reason, and at the ex∣pence of truth, justice, natural righteousness and equity; I shall endeavour to set the truth of our proposition in a most clear and evident point of light, before the minds of all who are disposed to receive truth, and impartially to attend to evidence.</P>
<P>AS another leading truth, and what may help us in the clear proof of our present proposition, we may en∣quire in this place, what that is which a people give up, or how much (if any thing) of their natural rights and privileges they part with, when they enter into civil state, and make them rulers and officers, of supreme and sub∣ordinate degree and authority.</P>
<P>HERE I shall first shew negatively, what a people do not give up, or part with, for the sake of civil society and government. 2dly I shall shew what they do really part with, of their natural rights and privileges, when they enter into civil state, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND here let it be observed, that a people do not give up, or part with their rights to the enjoyment of their persons and properties, free of all molestations, in∣juries, invasions and seizures whatever: no such right do the people part with, when they enter into civil state and combination, and make them rulers supreme and subordinate for its well being.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="014036_0048_0F92ABD21D5765F8"/>FOR, that they may enjoy their persons and properties thus free and unmolested, is one principal end of their entering into civil state; and they never can be suppos∣ed to give up and relinquish their right and title to the enjoyment of those things, when they enter into civil state, for the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of which things, as one main end in view, they entered into a civil state. For this would be to suppose a people to enter in∣to civil state and combination, for the enjoyment of cer∣tain things in peace and quiet, the enjoyment of which things, they give up all claim and title to, when they enter into civil state and combination. Which would evidently be again, to suppose a people to have a certain main end in view, in entering into civil state and socie∣ty, which main end they have no reference to at all, in entering into a civil state and society. A most grossly contradictious and absurd supposition!</P>
<P>WE have already sufficiently proved, if it really want∣ed any proof, that one principal end and design A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. had in mind, when they entered into civil state, was that they might enjoy their persons and properties free from all injuries and invasions; we must not therefore now suppose them to have given up, or re∣linquished, their right to the enjoyment of their persons and properties, free of all injuries and invasions; least we fall upon gross and shameful absurdities, and the most palpable contradictions.</P>
<P>A people then, do always retain their right and title to the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their persons and properties, though they have entered into civil state and combination,</P>
<P>AGAIN, a people do not give up their right to have a voice in all public decisions concerning peace and war with other states; making alliances with other powers; sending and receiving embassies; entering into national leagues and compacts; settling and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not pretend to determine how a people ought to have a voice in all these matters▪ whe∣ther personally, or by a representation; though perhaps it is no hard matter to determine.—But a voice they
<PB N="49" REF="014036_0049_0F92ABD2EA629218"/>
must have. And that every people have a natural and unalienable right to a voice in such decisions, wants no proof: and therefore that they cannot be suppo∣sed to give up, or even to be capable to give up, such right, when they enter into civil state, is equally certain. When kingdoms levy war, or make peace with other states; when they make alliances with foreign powers; send and receive embassies; enter into national leagues and compacts; settle and regulate trade and commerce, &amp;c. who is not very sensible, that all these things have respect to the people, and tend exceedingly, either to make them easy and quiet, or uneasy and dis∣quiet in the enjoyment of their persons and properties, their natural and unalienable rights and priviledges? Pride and avarice many times may excite kings to levy war with foreign states, and carry them on, tho' ex∣ceeding prejudicial to the people; draining them of money and men, and many other things necessary to carry on the war. And so on the other hand, timidity and an unseasonable fearfulness, self-interest, &amp;c. may prevail with them to make peace with other states, great∣ly to their dishonour and detriment of their own. Kings may enter into alliances with other powers, such as are very unsafe and dangerous to the people. They may send and receive embassies most unhappy for their sub∣jects, and themselves too; as has often been the case. Such national leagues and compacts may be made by princes, as will expose their own kingdoms to ravages and depredations, in an unlucky time. They may set∣tle and regulate trade and commerce with their own or other countries, upon such bottoms, and in such man∣ner, as may be very pernicious to the people.</P>
<P>Now as all these things so evidently respect the people, and tend so directly to their good or ill, to their enjoyment, or non-enjoyment of their persons and properties in peace and quiet; we must never conclude that the people do, or can, give up their natural right to a voice in public decisions about all such matters, when they enter into civil state, with a design to promote their best interest: Unless we mean
<PB N="50" REF="014036_0050_0F92ABD39B5A51C0"/>
to go into the former gross absurdity; and to maintain, that people have a great regard to the quiet and peace∣able enjoyment of their persons and properties, in en∣tering into civil state; and yet that they have no regard to these at all, but set this matter entirely aside, when they enter in civil state!</P>
<P>WAR can never be levied, peace never made, with foreign states, without the voice of the people: Alli∣ances can never be settled, nor embassies sent and re∣ceived, national leagues and compacts cannot be de∣termined, trade and commerce never founded and regu∣lated, but with the consenting voice and suffrage of the people personally, or by representation. Let this be ano∣ther settled point, that a people do not give up their right to have a voice in all public decisions concerning peace &amp; war with other states; making alliances with foreign powers; entering into leagues and compacts; sending and receiving embassies; settling and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. when they enter into civil state, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and safety.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, the people do not give up their right of judging and determining in matters of religion; or their right to protection in the public worship of the Deity, in such manner as they please, or shall judge best, not injurious to the civil state.</P>
<P>WE have proved, that the people have a special re∣gard to their protection and security in the public wor∣ship of God, when they enter into civil state, and make them rulers supreme and subordinate: and consequent∣ly, that it is a main part of the trust which is reposited with them, to defend and protect the people, while they pay public honours to the divinity, in any manner not prejudicial to the civil state. Now, if the people do not give up their right of protection and defence, in the pub∣lic worship of God, in what manner they please, not de∣trimental to the civil state, then certainly they still hold this natural right to determine and judge in religious matters for themselves, and in what manner they will worship God in public; if so be they do not prejudice
<PB N="51" REF="014036_0051_0F92ABD490C67AB8"/>
the state: i. e. if they perform public worship with de∣cency, propriety and regularity, according to reason and sacred revelation.</P>
<P>EVERY man has an unalienable right of private judg∣ment in all matters of a religious nature. Nor is it in his power to give up this right into the hands of any man, or number of men upon earth. For if one man should constitute another his judge in matters of reli∣gion, and should put the decision of all his articles of religious creed into his hands; this would be the same thing, as tho' he should delegate a power to another man to go to Heaven for him, and be happy for him, in the favour and enjoyment of God. For the religion of na∣ture, and of her God too, requires the judgment of e∣very individual man, as well as his love and affections▪ Unless therefore, one man can delegate to another, a power to love and serve God, with all fidelity and con∣science for him, and so to be happy for him, he cannot give him a power to judge for him in matters of a reli∣gious nature. But whoever tries the experiment, to find whether he can be happy in the happiness of another, when the instruments of misery, and the engines of tor∣ment and death are perpetually playing upon him, will be effectually convinced of his error and folly, by a sensible argument very undesirable and painful. Just as absurd and impossible is it then, for one man to give up his right of judgment in religious matters to another, as it is for him to make himself happy in the happiness of another, or to go to Heaven upon anothers merits.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine is better calculated to suit a Roman climate and constitution, than an American: Tho' it will one great day be found not to have been agreeable to either, when every man will be rewarded or punished for his own judgment, faith and practice, and not for those of another. Men do no not therefore give up their right to judge for themselves in the great affairs of religion, to civil magistrates; nor have civil ma∣gistrates any power or authority given them by God or men, to judge for the people in these matters. But as every man must be happy or miserable for himself, in
<PB N="52" REF="014036_0052_0F92ABD526F822A0"/>
another world, so every man must judge, and believe, and practice for himself in this world.</P>
<P>IF men have a right and it is their indispensable duty, to judge for themselves in matters of religion, as hath now been proved; then certainly they have a right to practice agreeable to their judgments, and conscientious sentiments, both in public and private; always provided they do not prejudice the civil state. I do not say that men are infallible, or that they cannot judge amiss, and practise wrong: or that their faith and practice may not be such as will expose them to the censure of Christ, in his church. This is very possible. But what I say is, that their faith and practice cannot expose them to the censure of the civil law, unless they are detrimental to the civil state. The laws and power of a civil magistate are forever limited and determined by the civil peace and welfare of the people, or the safety and happiness of the civil state. Whenever any man's faith and practice in religious matters, are detrimental to the civil state, they properly fall under the cognizance of the civil magis∣trate: when they are not, let them be what they may, or ever so wrong in other respects, they are not cogniza∣ble by the civil magistrate. Tho' it may be accounted a certain maxim, that when any man's faith and prac∣tice, in religious matters, are disadvantageous to the civil state, they are wrong in theory, wrong in reason and revelation both. For it is inconceivable that any religious sentiments or practices, which are founded up∣on reason and sacred revelation, should be unfavourable to the civil interests and well-being of any people.</P>
<P>BUT lest some should suspect that I here contradict what I have said elsewhere, viz. that civil magistrates are bound to defend and protect and maintain the public worship of God, and even to use the civil sword, if no∣thing else will do, to maintain it. Let them observe that in the very place where I said this, I proved, that the public worship of God, and observation of religion, were very greatly advantageous to the civil state. This is nothing contradictory to what I now say, but exactly coincident with it. For I do not say that civil magis∣trates
<PB N="53" REF="014036_0053_0F92ABD72EA8F240"/>
are under any obligations to nourish and cherish such worship of the Deity, and practice of religion, as is not founded in reason, and sacred revelation; or to main∣tain such as is detrimental to the civil state.</P>
<P>SO LONG as men believe and practice no doctrines in∣consistent with the peace and felicity of the state, they must be protected by the state.</P>
<P>THIS then may be another determined point, that a people do not give up their right of private judgment, in matters of religion, or their consciences, when they enter into civil state; nor their right to actual protecti∣on in the public worship of the Deity, in such manner as is not prejudicial to the civil state.</P>
<P>BUT thus much may suffice to have said upon the ne∣gative side of this question: though it may be that I have not mentioned every thing that the people do not give up for the sake of a civil state, and perhaps some may think I have mentioned too many.</P>
<P>I would say positively, a people do give up their per∣sonal right to defend and secure their persons and Pro∣perties, in all ordinary cases.</P>
<P>IN a state of nature, each individual man hath a just right to defend his own person against all assaults, and to repel force with force, and to secure his person from any injury that may be offered to it. But a civil state being entered into, and civil rulers chosen, and invested with power and authority to make and execute laws for the defence and security of every man's person who belongs to the state; each indivdual man has no longer a right inherent and personal, to defend his own person, and to resist force with force, when he shall be assaulted and vio∣lence offered to his person. This right to defend his own person, which he before had, while he lived in a na∣tural state, he hath given up to the civil state, and it is now the duty and business of the state to de∣fend and protect the person of each individual in in it. Yea, it would be directly to counteract the design, as one principal design, of entering into a civil state, if each individual in it should still retain and exercise a right to defend his own person. This would be to take the business, which properly belongs to the civil state,
<PB N="54" REF="014036_0054_0F92ABD76BDAEDC0"/>
out of their hands and to put it back again into the hands of individuals, in whose hands it truly was in the natural state; and so it would be to evert the very foun∣dation of the civil state. So that it is most apparent, that each individual in a civil state, has not a right in or∣dinary cases, (for I shall immediately shew that individu∣als may have a right, in some cases, to defend their own persons, themselves) to defend his own person from inju∣ries, and that he hath given up this right into the hands of the civil state.</P>
<P>NOW let me say, that in some exempt cases, it may be the duty of individuals to defend and secure their own per∣sons, even in a civil state. For, though it be the duty and business of a civil state, to defend and protect the per∣sons of individuals; yet civil rulers and officers cannot be every where, and in all places, at the same time, for they are not supposed to be omni-present; and therefore they cannot always prevent injuries being offered to in∣dividuals. And it may happen that individuals may be assaulted by ruffians, robbers, banditti and lawless wretches, and their lives endangered; when no assistance or relief can be had from civil authority: in such case, individuals have a right to defend themselves, and to prevent, if possible, injuries being committed upon them. And they must be considered to be in some sense, in a state of nature, whilst they do thus. To defend them∣selves in such a case, would be a duty owing to their own persons, by the great laws of nature and self-pre∣servation.</P>
<P>SO also with regard to individuals having a right to defend their properties: in all ordinary cases, they may not defend and secure their properties, by their own per∣sonal exertions, and without any directions so to do from civil authority; but must refer the defence and security of them to the civil state. Yet in some extraordinary cases it may be very warrantable and just for individuals to defend and secure their properties, as well as their persons, themselves.</P>
<P>IT is so also with respect to the protection of individu∣als in the public worship of the Deity. Every man, in a
<PB N="55" REF="014036_0055_0F92ABD81A67E728"/>
state of nature, has a right to protect himself, in all his observation of religion and worship of God: but in a civil state he has not. He hath given up his personal right to protect himself in the worship of God, into the hands of the civil magistrate; and it is now become the duty of the state, and what every one expects of them, to see to it that all individuals are protected and secured, when they worship God, in any way, not prejudicial to the civil good and welfare.</P>
<P>A people also give up so much of their private pro∣perty, or estate, as is necessary to support their civil ma∣gistrates and the state with honour and dignity, and to de∣fray all the charges and expences of the common wealth.</P>
<P>I have shewn that the people are under obligations to give their civil rulers an honourable reward for their services to the state.</P>
<P>THE people must also bear the charges of war, when that is necessary; the expences of ambassadors, &amp;c. in∣deed they must give up so much of their properties and estates, as is required for the good and well being of the civil state: that so they may enjoy themselves and the rest of their properties in peace and prosperity.</P>
<P>I think I have now finished what I intended, before I should enter upon the direct proof of the proposition now under consideration: which asserts, that the people have right and authority to dethrone their King, and put down all other inferior officers, when they shall counteract their obligations to them, and cease to answer the ends of their appointment, and constitution in places of public trust &amp; authority,</P>
<P>HERE we must make some recollections, and lay mat∣ters together in a true and clear point of light, that so we may be under better circumstances to form a good judg∣ment to reason right, and come at the truth of the case.</P>
<P>IT hath been clearly shewn under the first proposition, that the people, and they only, have right to erect a civil state, to appoint and constitute a king supreme, and sub∣ordinate civil rulers and officers. As to the ends and de∣signs of the people entering into civil state it hath been shewn under the second proposition, that they were these▪ viz.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="014036_0056_0F92ABD9C91F6748"/>THAT they (the people) might enjoy their persons and properties free of all molestations and injuries, in peace and safety: that they might be protected and secured in the worship of the Deity, and public observation of reli∣gion; and that such public observation of religion might be maintained and kept up among all the people. In∣deed, the people really designed to be protected and se∣cured in the enjoyment of their persons and properties, their natural and acquired rights, their privileges and advantages of a temporal and eternal nature, pertaining to the present and an everlasting state of being.</P>
<P>THE people enter into civil state, the people make kings, and all other civil rulers, and these now menti∣oned are some of the principal ends and designs they had in view, when they made them.</P>
<P>NOW, if kings and civil rulers, in all their several places and spheres of action, will not exert themselves to defend and secure the people in the quiet and unmolest∣ed enjoyment of their persons and properties; i. e. their persons and all their worldly goods, estates and chattles which they have gotten by their honest labour, toil, in∣dustry and frugality; together with all those just privi∣leges and advantages they have to gain more worldly goods, estates and chattles, such as labour, industry, fru∣gality, trade, commerce, manufactures, &amp;c. If kings and rulers will not defend the persons and these proper∣ties of the people: if they will not defend and protect the peole while they attend, with decency and regulari∣ty, upon the public observation of religion, and main∣tain among them the public worship of God, in such manner as the people choose, not injurious to the state: if they do not make truth and righteousness, the laws of God, and the reason and nature of things, their standards in making civil laws: but if, instead of behaving thus, so agreeable to their obligations both to God and the people, they should deprive the people of their just rights and privileges; deny them a voice in all public deci∣sions concerning peace and war with other states; ma∣king alliances with foreign powers; sending and receiv∣ing embassies; entering into leagues and compacts; set∣tling
<PB N="57" REF="014036_0057_0F92ABDAF68FED10"/>
and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. If they establish by laws such modes and forms of religion and public worship, as are very pernicious to the state, as well as contrary to reason and the laws of God: I say, if kings and civil rulers thus concern not themselves for the temporal nor eternal interests of the people; but being possessed of tyrannic and despotic principles, obstinately proceed according to their own minds and views of kings, and persist to prosecute such measures of administration, to make and execute such laws as are detrimental to the state, and destructive of the liberties, peace, happiness and tranquility of the people, and tending directly and naturally to the total ruin of the whole body politic; and if they will not, by all the gentle and humane mea∣sures that the people can use with them, be reclaimed from their despotic and destructive proceedure; the peo∣ple have just right and authority to exert themselves more vigorously, and dethrone their king, and take all such corrupt rulers out of those places of power and trust, in which they had fixed them, for quite other purposes.</P>
<P>IF the reasonings and conclusions under the first pro∣position be true and good, then this is an evident and undeniable truth. Yea, it seems to be a most plain and evident truth, barely from this fair representation of the case. But let us see in one view, how undeniable this truth appears, from what was proved under the first pro∣position. If men, in a state of nature, have each an in∣dividual right to his own person and property, and to defend and secure to himself the enjoyment of them, free from all injuries and invasions whatsoever; and a right also to an equivalent to any injury done his person, or in∣vasion made of his property, or to make reprisals: if such natural society have right to enter into civil state, and to appoint and constitute Kings and civil rulers; to deter∣mine what mode of government shall take place, and what laws they will be governed by, for their civil good, protection, liberty, peace and safety: I say, if a society in a state of nature have such rights, then most certainly and justly they do retain so much of their natural rights, even after civil combination and compact, that, if their
<PB N="58" REF="014036_0058_0F92ABDB322CAA60"/>
King and civil rulers will not give them liberty, pro∣tection, &amp;c. in the enjoyment of their persons and pro∣perties and religion, but grossly and shamefully counter∣act their most solemn obligations to them, and cease to answer their ends in making them civil rulers, and invest∣ing them with civil power and authority, they may de∣throne their King, and take all inferior officers and rulers out of their places of public trust and authority; and re∣vert to a state of nature.</P>
<P>IF a people have not a right to dethrone their King, in case he proves a tyrant, and ceases to consult their good and happiness, and to secure to them their precious rights and natural privileges and properties, which the great King of Kings hath indulged them with; 'tis an inevitable and undeniable consequence, that they have not a right to their persons and properties, nor any au∣thority to secure them from injuries and seizures: i. e. they have not a just right to consult their own temporal and eternal interest, nor to promote them: and this is to say flatly and plainly, that they have no interest at all, neither temporal nor eternal. For not to have a right to defend and secure one's interest, is not to have right to use it as one's own; but not to have a right to use a thing as one's own, is not to have any right to the use of that thing; and this is, not to have any right to that thing at all: for to say that any one has a right to a thing, &amp; not a right to use that thing is a palpable contradiction! For a peo∣ple to dethrone a tyrant, a King who does not consult nor pro∣mote the good &amp; happiness of their people, but the contrary, is for the people to consult their own good &amp; happiness. That people then, who have not a right to dethrone a cor∣rupt &amp; tyrannic King, one who does not answer the end for which he was made king, have not a right to consult, promote, defend and secure their own liberties, peace &amp; happiness; but that people who have not a right to con∣sult, promote, defend &amp; secure their own liberties, peace &amp; happiness, have no such things as liberties, peace and happiness predicable of them▪ according to the foregoing reasoning. Unless then we mean flatly to deny that there are any such things as rights and properties, in persons
<PB N="59" REF="014036_0059_0F92ABDBDED923F8"/>
and estates, &amp;c. which may justly be said to belong to any people, we must never deny that people have a right to dethrone their king, when he proves to be a tyrant, and will not concern himself about them, nor endea∣vour to protect them in the enjoyment of their persons and properties, and religion, but wholly disserves the great purposes for which he was seated upon the throne. If any thing in nature is capable of proof, these rights of the people in this respect, are capable to be proved, and of being set in a most convincing and clear point of light before all reasonable and impartial minds.</P>
<P>NAY, it is as capable of demonstration, as any pro∣position in Euclid, that a king, when he will not ful∣fil his obligations to the people, but ceases to answer their ends and designs in raising him to royal dignity and trust, or counteracts these purposes by his tyrannic and dethrones conduct, does, ipso facto, cease to be king, and dethrones himself: He is no longer king, nor to be reputed such. What in the name of common sense is a king made for? or what does the name king signify? is it an important and sacred thing, or a mere trifle? is it a rattle, a bauble from the toyshops to please chil∣dren with? or is there an important and weighty charge and trust reposited with the man who wears the name of king; which if he fulfil, he is to be honoured and re∣vered by all the people; but if he does not, he is no longer king▪ or worthy that name? I am serious: I ask whe∣ther a king is made such for himself, for his own ease and pleasure, that he may spend his days in luxury, wanton∣ness and debauchery? or is he made such for his wisdom, probity and benevolence, to be active, and to exert himself to the utmost to maintain the invaluable rights, properties and priviledges of the people, and to secure to them all the advantages and emoluments which God and nature have conferred upon them, both of a temporal and eternal significancy? If he be not made king purely for himself, and if the people really de∣signed when they raised him to royal dignity, and put the royal tiara upon his head, that he should consult and promote their good, and make them happy in the
<PB N="60" REF="014036_0060_0F92ABDCBAA51790"/>
quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of their persons and properties and religion; then, if he does not consult and promote their good, nor endeavour to make them quiet and happy in the enjoyment of their persons, proper∣ties and religion; but shamefully and notoriously coun∣teracts these obligations to the people, pray tell me, is he any longer king over that people, or rather hath he not by such egregious violations of his sacred trust, for∣feited all title to the crown? must the people still revere him, and are they yet bound to yield obedience to him, as to their rightful sovereign! tho' he is doing all that in him is, to deprive them of those rights and priviledges, which they justly account dear to them as their very lives. Tho' his principles are ever so tyrannic and despotic, and he continually brings them forth into practice, to the ruin and destruction of the people: must the people yet be his liege subjects, must they worship, honour and o∣bey him as their king! must that nonsensical, inju∣rious and accursed doctrine of passive obedience be still preached up, whilst the people are most cruelly deprived of those rights which the great God of nature hath in∣dulged them with, and made dupes and slaves to the tyrant and his parasites! must the people suffer in their persons, their properties and their religion, and yet vary tamely truckle to the yoke, and quietly suffer the chains of oppression and vassalage to be rivited upon their necks, and the necks of their posterity yet unborn, whilst they meanly and basely crouch down their heads for this hellish purpose! must the people receive and be very obsequious to all the commands, orders, statutes and laws, which have the royal signet tacked to them, tho' they tend most naturally and directly to snatch from them the dearest priviledges and most darling rights they have, appertaining to this, or another life! mu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there be no such thing as resistance heard of among the people, tho' tyranny and despotism, wantonness and ve∣nality, debauchery and voluptuousness, are continually forging manacles and fetters for them▪ Let the man who dare to say such things as these, plead that man∣kind have any such things as properties, rights, pri∣vileges,
<PB N="61" REF="014036_0061_0F92ABDD8854ACD8"/>
security, peace or happiness predicable of, and naturally belonging to them if he has so much ef∣frontery. This doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance had better be sent back again to hell, where it was certainly hatched, than to be preached up in this day of light and knowledge and superior discernment: when the rights of mankind, of kings and people, are better understood, and more ably defended, than when this doctrine was first sent up from the infernal regions into Great-Britain.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance, 'tis true, was sounded from many pulpits in Great-Bri∣tain, by the court-clergy, presently after the glorious reformation began to gain ground in England; tho' it be so very similar to some doctrines of that apostate church; I mean the Romish church. In the time of Elizabeth, that illustrious princess; but especially in the time of the first Stuart, was this doctrine first preach∣ed up. This is evident in many, or all, the histories of his reign. It may be seen by any one who has an in∣clination, by looking upon the cannons of kingly pow∣power, in Nalson's abstract of them. A part of the first canon I shall take liberty to recite in this place. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal's History of the Puritans, quarto Ed. l. <HI>632.</HI></NOTE>
<Q>That the most high and sacred order of kings is of divine right, being the ordinance of God himself, founded in the prime laws of nature and revelation, by which the supreme power over all persons civil and ecclesiastical is given to them.</Q>

<P>BUT these doctrines of absolute, unlimited obedience to Kings, and non resistance have long since been explod∣ed almost universally, as most unreasonable and nonsensi∣cal, destructive of all the natural rights and properties of the people, and disonant to all just principles of self-preservation. Yet, though the most learned divines, and ablest politicians have many years since, disavowed and refuted them, upon the soundest maxims of reason and revelation, some will still cherish and endeavour to main∣tain them; tho' they are forced in order to do this, as I think, to shipwreck reason, and commit an horrid rape upon sacred revelation. In this the old proverb is veri∣fied, that no brat is so ugly, having had a mother, as to die for want of a nurse. For if any brat was ugly enough to be disowned after its birth, and exposed to struglings and death, it should really seem as tho' the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance was: but alas! this very doctrine is so lucky as to find some, who are willing to cherish and foster it yet!</P>
<P>WE see, in the conon above cited, St. Paul introduced as a voucher for the doctrine! But if I was perfectly un∣acquainted with St. Paul's abilities and doctrines, and had only heard that he was inspired, and had received sufficient evidence to induce me to believe it; I should immediately declare that he was pressed into the service, and shamefully misinterpreted: for 'tis impossible that an inspired man should be a volunteer in such drudgery as this.</P>
<P>BUT it seems necessary that I here spend a few thoughts upon that text of St. Paul. For if he was a preacher of the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance, I am grossly mistaken, and have hitherto scandalously mis∣understood the true meaning of that inspired man, and must certainly read my bible with more care and attenti∣on for the future. The text referred to in the canon is in
<PB N="63" REF="014036_0063_0F92ABDF42769998"/>
St. Paul's epistle to the Romans xiii.1.8. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be, are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</P>
<P>FOR rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: For he is the minister of God; a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For, for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are Gods ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</P>
<P>I HAVE set down this scripture at large; and I shall now enquire for its true meaning, and whether doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance are really preach∣ed in it, or not.</P>
<P>I WOULD have this scripture well understood: and therefore desire that several things may be very carefully considered, which will be assisting to us in gaining its true interpretation.</P>
<P>WE must distinguish critically between the power of Kings and civil rulers, civil power, or civil government, in general; the way and means by which any men come to be possessed of such power; and the use and improve∣ment they make of their power. These things are very diverse, and easily distinguished by every one.</P>
<P>CIVIL power, or civil government, simply considered, is undoubtedly ordained of God. No one will pretend to dispute this. Civil government, when considered as abstracted from the ways and means by which men come to be vested with it, may truly be said to be of divine ori∣ginal. 'Tis very plain that God designed that a race of
<PB N="64" REF="014036_0064_0F92ABDFE4AAFA68"/>
men should be continued upon earth, until the general judgment, or the consummation of all things, at the se∣cond coming of his divine and glorious son. But it is as plain, that a race of men could not be continued thus long upon the earth, and Gods great designs and pur∣poses, in his universal plan of things, have been effected, without civil government taking place among them. The unavoidable consequence is, that God designed that civil government should be set up among men, and that this was one link in the infinite chain, one event amongst innumerable others, which God designed should have existence, when he formed the amazing projection of a universe. Thus 'tis demonstrable from reason, and the very nature of those things which God hath consti∣tuted, and permitted to take place in his world, that civil government is by divine appointment.</P>
<P>GOOD David seems thus to understand the matter. ps. lxv.6, 7. For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: He putteth down one and setteth up ano∣ther. Of this same opinion was Daniel, chap. 11, 21, 37. And he changeth the times, and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings.—Thou, O king! art a king of kings: and the God of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. Thus civil or kingly power, considered as sejoined from the way and means by which men come to be possessed of such power is from God.</P>
<P>BUT unless we consider civil power, or royal power, as thus separated from the way and means by which men arrive at such power, we shall unavoidably run into gross errors; as many have done, in explaining the text we are now upon. Civil power is of God. But who dare to say that all the ways and means by which men have ever become vested with civil power are of God, in the same sense as the power itself is! 'Tis certain, God has sometimes disapproved of Kings, and plainly de∣clared they were none of his. Hose, viii.4. They have set up kings but not by me: They have made princes
<PB N="65" REF="014036_0065_0F92ABE450B15C78"/>
and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols; that they may be cut off. What was it God was so displeased with, concerning these kings? was it with the regal power itself? or was it not rather with the people's corrupt and idolatrous ways and means by which they raised them to, and maintained them in their regal power and dignity?</P>
<P>KINGS have many times mounted thrones, and as∣sumed royal power and authority, in most unjust and unnatural ways. Many by mere conquest and invasions, by murdering in a cruel and barbarous manner, the reign∣ing princes, and the royal families, have got themselves proclaimed and seated upon their thrones. Every one, who is ever so little acquainted with civil history, knows all this to be true, and much more of the like kind. But who will say that all these ways and methods of acquiring civil and royal power are from God, as the power itself is! Does Heaven approve of unjust invasi∣ons, cruel murders and bloodshed, and all the innume∣rable ways in which inhuman tyrants have slaughtered innocent kings and their families, and mounted their thrones!</P>
<P>AGAIN, we must consider the use and improvement which men make of civil power, as a distinct thing from the power itself. The power itself, we may say again, is of God. But I presume no man will say, that God hath ordained all the uses that have been made of civil power, by all the wicked, tyrannic and despotic princes, that have reigned since Nimrod built Nineveh and reigned there; in the same sense, in which he hath or∣dained civil power, or the power which those wretches and pests of mankind were invested with, when simply considered! If any one is inclined to think so, let him cast his eyes upon his bible, and read I. Kings xi.31, 35, 37. And he said unto Jeroboam, take thee ten princes: for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, be∣hold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solo∣mon, and will give ten tribes to thee.—But I will take the kingdom out of his sons hand, and will give it unto
<PB N="66" REF="014036_0066_0F92ABE4D739E088"/>
thee, even ten tribes.—And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE was it that Jehovah was thus displeased with Solomon, even so as to snatch from him ten princes, or tribes, and to give so large a part of the kingdom, as ten twelfths at least, to his servant Jeroboam? was it because Solomon sat on the throne of Israel, swayed a sceptre, and had civil power and government reposited with him? If we look back a little to v.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. we shall find what the cause of God's resentment was, and wherefore he took the kingdom from Solomon, or his son.</P>
<P><HI>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Am∣monites. And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem; and for Molah the abomination of the children of Ammon. And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burned incense and sacrificed unto their strange gods. Thus Solomon was guilty of gross and shameful idolatry; and for this cause God expressly told him that he would take the kingdom from him. v.xi. of the same chapter. Therefore the Lord said unto Solomon, forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant, and my statutes, which I commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY one who understands the constitution of the Hebrew civil government, knows that idolatry was, cri∣men lesae majestatis, or high treason against Jehovah, who was the politic head, and supreme civil ruler in the Jewish nation; as it was setting up another god in the stead of Jehovah, their only God and King. Idolatry was also high treason against the civil state itself of the Hebrews, it was a notorious and direct subversion of the constitution, an open breach of the magna charta of that nation. When therefore Solomon built high places for
<PB N="67" REF="014036_0067_0F92ABE6DB051570"/>
Ashtoreth, Milcom, Chemosh and Molech, he set up those idols for gods, in affront to Jehovah the true God and rightful sovereign of Israel, than which, no crime that he was capable to commit, tended more directly and naturally to subvert the very foundation of the constitution of the Jewish civil polity, and to counteract the magna charta of the Hebrews, and to expose the whole nation to Jehovah's wrath, and so to total ruin.</P>
<P>FOR this corrupt use or abuse of his royal power, in king Solomon, Jehovah was displeased. We plainly see these three things to be very distinct; civil power, or civil go∣vernment, simply considered; the ways and methods by which men become vested with civil power; and the use and improvement they make of it.</P>
<P>Now, we are ready perhaps to ascertain the genuine meaning of the text of St Paul. When St. Paul says, that there is no power but of God, he means that no civil power, by what ways and means soever obtained, is without God's permission; and that civil power, or civil government, simply considered, is according to God's eternal purpose and design: and when he says, that the powers that be, are ordained of God; he means that civil government, regal and imperial power and authority, abstracted from the ways and means by which men unjustly obtain such power, are really the ordinance and appointment of God. When he says, whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; he means, that whosoever resisteth, or opposeth civil pow∣er, as such, or civil government as such, resisteth or opposeth God's ordinance. And very well may such a one be said to merit damnation. Or such as thus resist and oppose God's ordinance or appointment, shall re∣ceive to themselves, and that justly, detriment or judg∣ment <HI>heautois krima leepsontai.</HI> The Apostle never dreampt of teaching the Romans, or any other people under Hea∣ven, that all the ways and methods, by which every emperor and prince, obtained imperial and royal power, and all the uses they ever made of such powers, were from God, and ordained by him, in the same sense, in which the powers themselves, or civil government, sim∣ply considered, was from God, and ordained by him!
<PB N="68" REF="014036_0068_0F92ABE7F6B543A8"/>
St. Paul knew, and every other man that knows any thing, knows, that God sometimes permits men to ob∣tain civil power by unnatural, cruel and very unrighte∣ous means; and to use such power when they have got it, for very corrupt and diabolical purposes, to the ruin and destruction of the people, the wretched subjects. And indeed it cannot otherwise be, so long as God per∣mits things to proceed, in the physical and moral worlds, according to their nature. So long as the great intel∣ligent author, and powerful upholder of the world, shall permit physical and moral causes to operate, and their effects to be produced according to their nature, there will unavoidably be great injuries, corruptions and wrongs in the moral and civil world. But this, by no means proves, that God is well pleased with, or ap∣proves of, these moral and civil wrongs. But when these things do happen in the world, when men either come thus to civil power and trust, or use it for such hor∣rid purposes, God disapproves; nor did St. Paul mean to make it the duty of any people, who can do other∣wise, tamely to submit to these powers, and without any the least resistance, to pay obedience to those laws and orders which tend naturally and directly to bring ruin, misery and death upon them and their children yet unborn! And it should really seem as tho' those men do wilfully misinterpret the inspired man, who would bear us in hand that he means any such thing. The Apostle expressly says, giving us an account of the qualificati∣ons of the civil power, or ruler, to whom christians ought to be subject and obedient, that rulers are not a terror to GOOD works, but to the EVIL. That he is the minister of God for GOOD. That he is an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth EVIL. And that we must be subject to civil rulers, not only for wrath, or be∣cause they have power to punish men, but for CONSCI∣ENCE sake. And that they are such men to whom tri∣bute, custom, fear and honour are due. Are tyrants, are traitors against the civil state, (for I suppose that a king is as capable of committing high treason as any of his subjects are; and that, to counteract the foundation laws, and constitutional principles of the state, is crimen lesae
<PB N="69" REF="014036_0069_0F92ABE899CC9188"/>
magnae chartae; equal to crimen lesae majestatis regiae) are those things and civil rulers who are a terror to good works, and an encouragement to evil, who execute wrath upon those that do well, and to whom no man can be subject for conscience sake, but for wrath only, are these the men, these the civil rulers to whom tribute, custom, fear and honour are due, and to whom christians, or any other people, are bound to pay passive obedience without the least resistance, on pain of damnation! such expressions in the sacred text, as above cited, would be apt to lead an honest enquirer after truth and the right of the case, to believe that St. Paul meant to exhort the Romans and all men, chearfully to obey their civil rulers who used their power and authority well, for Gods glory and the good of the people. And such a man would be very hardly persuaded to suspect that the apostle meant to teach, that men ought to yield an absolute and unlimited obedience, without any resistance, to civil rulers, let them be, or do, what they will, or what their tyrannic, despotic and corrupt principles would naturally lead them to do!</P>
<P>SUCH an interpretation of St. Paul as some have given, and still continue to give, might easily be shewn to be re∣plete with the foulest absurdities, and to be contrary to truth, natural justice and righteousness; which would prove those men, who are the authors of such interpreta∣tion, to have bad hearts, or weak heads, or both.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear, having been too prolix already upon this text, &amp; chearfully submit my interpretation to the test of truth and reason and the word of God, little doubting but it will be well approved by them all.</P>
<P>I WELL know that there are several objections made, some against the truth of the doctrine of this 4th proposi∣tion; others against such doctrine's being practiced upon: and there are also a few texts of holy scriptures, that are alledged against the doctrine, besides that we have so largely treated upon. This doctrine, every one knows, hath been practiced in the British nation, as well as in many others. I pray to God, that Great-Britain may ne∣ver again see the day, when it shall become necessary for the people to exert themselves, as hath been proved to be right they should, to dethrone a British King! But this
<PB N="70" REF="014036_0070_0F92ABE99B056778"/>
rueful time may come. I did not design, when I first un∣dertook to study and write upon this subject, to do any more than barely to prove the truth of the doctrines I ad∣vanced: whether I have done so much, or not, I freely submit. For several reasons that might be given, were it necessary, I shall not be very officious in answering ob∣jections.</P>
<P>YET I will say a few words, in answer to two or three objections against the impleaded doctrine.</P>
<P>ONE objection, which seems to be pointed against the truth of the doctrine of the first proposition, as well as against the doctrine of the 4th being put in practice, is, that it will deprive Kings of a legal trial, by their Peers, which is a privilege granted, in the best regulated states, to all the subjects.</P>
<P>EVERY one may see, by adverting to the first proposi∣tion, that this objection is directly against its truth. For if the people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and constitute a King supreme, and all subordinate civil officers and rulers over them, &amp;c. then the people are the original of civil power: and if civil pow∣er originates from the people, the plain and undeniable consequence is, that the people are the proper judges whether the power they invest their king with be used well or ill: and if so, the people are the peers, before whose tribunal the king must be judged; they are the persons, call them what you please, before whom the king must stand or fall.</P>
<P>IN a mixed monarchy, if the people have been pleased to constitute such, when the king is corrupted, and is en∣clined to be too absolute, and will not give the royal as∣sent to bills which have passed the states, or parliament, but is resolutely engaged to be a tyrannic and despotic sovereign, and not to rule the kingdom by wholesome laws; then the states or parliament have the power of ex∣ecution, as well as of legislation, devolved upon them; and have right and authority, with the voice of the people, to dethrone the tyrannic king. But if the states of par∣liament are also corrupted, and have drank so deep, with the king, of the spirit of absoluteness and despotism, that the people are deprived of their natural rights and
<PB N="71" REF="014036_0071_0F92ABEA1BC1F118"/>
privileges, so that they can no longer endure; then both the legislative and executive powers are reverted to the people, and they have a right in the sight of God, the king of kings and lord over all, to convict, judge and condemn the king and the states of parliament, by their constitution, and the magna charta of the kingdom. All this is true if the proposition be true; therefore the ob∣jection is of no force, so long as the truth of our first pro∣position remains unrefuted. 'Tis the business therefore of the objector to disprove the truth of that proposition. When he shall do this, I will grant to him, that the king is not accountable to the people for any uses or abuses of his royal power, and will immediately commence a preacher of the doctrines of passive obedience and non-re∣sistance. Another objection against the practice upon the 4th proposition, is, that it will introduce anarchy and confusion, club-laws, &amp;c. to the inevitable destruction of the liberties, peace and happiness of the whole civil com∣munity.</P>
<P>TO this objection I would say, it is possible that the dethroning a King, and the removal of civil rulers out of their places of power and trust, may have some bad tendencies, unless great care, wisdom and prudence be exercised. But if the important and interesting affair be managed wisely and prudently, it is not supposable, that greater mischiefs and miseries will ensue, upon the de∣throning a King, who is a tyrannic and wicked ruler, &amp;c. than must be endured by the people, so long as a tyrant is on the throne, and his corrupt creatures and parasites kept in places of power and trust about him. England was never more happy before, nor much more since, than after the head of the first Stuart was severed from his body, and while it was under the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell. 'Tis true, there were confusions in the in∣teregnum, after the death of that friend and lover of his country and the liberties of mankind. But who caus∣ed them? They were such men as will unavoidably give disturbances to any people either in a natural or civil state, or in a state that is neither, if they be allowed. Men that have an unbounded desire, and an insatiable thirst for empire, as Fleetwood, Desborough, Lambert, Sir
<PB N="72" REF="014036_0072_0F92ABEAD93C6360"/>
Hen. Vane, and some others, undoubtedly had, if they are not promoted, will make any state or people on earth uneasy, and give them trouble and difficulty.</P>
<P>THESE were the men who were the fomenters of all the divisions and confusions of 1659.</P>
<P>AGAIN 'tis said, that a king must have respect to his own honour, dignity and happiness, as well as to the safe∣ty and tranquility of the state and people, in all his ad∣ministrations.</P>
<P>I ALLOW this objection to be a good one, and am rea∣dy to confess that a king must endeavour his own honour, dignity and happiness in his government; but then I suppose that a king cannot take a more direct and effec∣tual method to advance and promote his own honour; dignity and happiness, than to rule his kingdom by good and wholesome laws; such as are well calculated to pro∣tect and defend the people, in the quiet enjoyment of their persons, properties and religion, and to give peace and tranquility to the whole state. Such laws, and such form of government and administration, as is most aptly calculated to promote the people's good, and to give uni∣versal ease, protection and security to the whole civil com∣munity, tends most naturally and directly to advance the honour and reputation, dignity and happiness of the prince who is on the throne. No king can be honourable or happy, whose kingdom is dishonourable, uneasy, oppres∣sed and unhappy. Every king, who desires to be honor∣able and happy, will endeavour to render his kingdon free and quiet, happy and powerful.</P>
<P>THIS is all I shall say upon the objections against the doctrines of this short tract, which I may call mine; tho' the rights of the people have been viewed by many others, much in the same point of light, in which I have held them up to view, yet I have not taken so much as one sentence from any author, but what I have given him credit for, in the bottom of the page, as every one will undoubtedly judge, who will give themselves the trouble to peruse these pages.</P>
<P>I HAVE said little or nothing about the method in which the people ought to proceed, in treating with civil magistrates, who do not use their power and authority for
<PB N="73" REF="014036_0073_0F92ABEB975E19F8"/>
the good and interest of the people, but violate their trust and obligations to them, in such manner as they cannot endure; nor do I suppose this business belongs to me. However, I leave this matter to the politicians and statesmen, not professing myself to be a politician: tho' I do profess myself to be a true friend to the rights and li∣berties of mankind, and an advocate for natural justice, righteousness and equity, as well as a liege subject to my rightful sovereign.</P>
<P>AS to any texts of sacred scriptures, which speak of the duties and obligations of the people to Kings and civil rulers, to honour, revere and obey them: I suppose that no text of scripture obliges any people tamely to submit to tyranny, oppression and slavery's hateful chains; but that many texts teach it to be the duty of a people to yield ready and chearful obedience to all civil rulers, who rule for God's glory and their best interest by making and executing wise and wholesome laws.</P>
<P>I AM not so vain as to imagine that what I have written upon this subject, will be very entertaining or profitable to my inteligent readers, if I should have any such, who have perused large volumes, studied much and are thoroughly acquainted with the laws of nature and nati∣ons. Nor was I persuaded to make these discourses pub∣lic for the benefit of such; but for the advantage of the people, to whose natural and justly acquired rights and privileges, I am firmly &amp; inviolably attached. For these I am willing to plead in my family, my closet, my pulpit and in public. And if I might be so happy, as to raise in the minds of the people, a just sense of those rights and privileges which nature and her God have indulged them with, and a manly and becoming resolution to as∣sert and defend them, in all wise, prudent and likely ways; I shall obtain my main design, in this short tractate; and shall heartily rejoice, in that I have been an instrument of doing some little good to my fellow men, in this early stage of my life and action, and think myself well repaid.</P>
