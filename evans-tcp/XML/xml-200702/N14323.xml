<HEAD>LETTER I. To CHARLES RIVERS, <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>NOW help me to rail, to curse that seducing libertine sex, who have for so many years been the subject of your satire.—Yes, Charles, I have for some time past been a convert to your opinion, my hopeful rib has followed the example of her eldest sister, but in iniquity she far out does her: your wise was comparatively a Diana, after being de∣tected in a faux pas she had the grace to bury herself and her shame in obscurity,—she has ever since been dead to the world,—her prudent retreat in some mea∣sure, aton'd for her fault;—your honor received only a slight scratch, compared to that which mine has suf∣fered; the broad shame comes staring in my face, and boys—pride forbids me to finish the horrid sentence—she is gone—we are separated for ever; I shall not take the trouble to sue for a divorce; why should I? since not even the charms of a Venus, with Pallas's mind, could tempt me again to play the fool and marry. I have thus got rid of one plague, but another still re∣mains. Can I sleep in peace.—Can I enjoy that ease, of which your indolent friend, as you often call me, is so fond, while it is still in the power of a female to plunge me deeper in dishonor—marry your daughter
<PB N="4" REF="018142_0003_0FA56292CD04DED8"/>
says somebody, I forget who, least she marry herself,—but an imprudent marriage in these our degenerate days, is not the worst a parent has to fear.</P>
<P>The girl already, young as she is, discovers so much of her mother's disposition, that I have the most dread∣ful forebodings of her future fate—who would have the courage to marry, did they but seriously weigh the con∣sequence.—This was not my case,—caught by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> face, and sprightly wit, without giving myself time to reflect, I rush'd into the fatal snare.—But all this you knew before; let me rather ask your opinion in regard to Bell.—What am I to do with her? she is now out of her teens, and has for some yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been under the tuition of a French governess, one of her mother's hope∣ful confidants, as I have discovered upon our late rup∣ture,—a sweet tutoress for a young girl to be sure!—Too late I repent my indolent inattention to her education. I saw she had a graceful ease in her manner, that she danced with elegance—sung agreeably and spoke French with fluency. Satisfied that she was mistress of these superficial accomplishments, I gave myself no farther trouble: Her mind,—ah! I fear it is irreparably per∣verted; had it been left in a state of nature, I might have had some hopes, but her native levity has gained new force, by the precepts of an intriguing governess; and the example of a mother lost to virtue.</P>
<P>Both these perverters, these poisoners of her youthful heart, are dismissed with the infamy they deserve; but 'tis too late—the mischief is done:—What my next step must be, heaven knows: The girl's continuing to live with me, is out of the question; I have neither talents nor inclination to commence her preceptor; I have no maiden sisters to undertake the important charge;—would to heaven I could find some place of safety to send her to, till I can fix on a fit husband for her.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="018142_0004_0FA56292F39CEFB8"/>
Her beauty; (for Bell has all her mother's charms, and I fear all her imperfections into the bargain) her beauty I say, and large fortune, will easily procure her a suitable match in this prudent age:—Do Charles, help me by your sage advice out of this dilemma; do you know any old dowager to whom I could commit her?—it must be in the country remember; for our old har∣ridans in town, are only more practised in the ways of vice than their grand-daughters; but an ancient castle in the country, moted round, with a starched virgin, neglected from her youth upwards, by the other sex; whom nature has fenced round on every side, and ef∣fectually secured from all attempts; who never heard the sepucing whispers of flattery; who never excited a tender sigh, or amorous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—could we find an un∣fortunate damsel like this? compelled to chastity, from dire necessity; this was a fit, a watchful dragon to guard the tempting fruit.</P>
<P>Adieu—I have a thousand engagements on my hands, and a thousand plagues in my head; but no si∣tuation in life, shall ever diminish the regard with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. Mr. RIVERS to Sir HENRY RICHMOND.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a married man in England, but who sooner, or later, will be compelled to subscribe to my creed.—I need not tell you what that creed is, since you have a thousand times, while an infidel, heard
<PB N="6" REF="018142_0005_0FA56293AAB428D0"/>
me repeat it.—Poor Harry;—well, <Q>your condition (our condition I should say) is not to be scorned,</Q> since the first men in the nation, "are now-a-days hor∣ned."</P>
<P>A pretty task you would have me engage in,—to go in quest of virginity,—of an old maid;—an old un∣married woman is, I trow, easily found; but for a maid,—you must first provide me with a few of those dogs mentioned in the Spectator,—my scent is not good enough to discover them.</P>
<P>I question if in all London such a phoenix is to be found out of leading-strings; and you want, not a youth∣ful, but an antient Duena.—The scheme you propose is chimerical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the best advice I can give you, is, that you send Bell to keep her cousin company.—My girl has been in a convent ever since her mother's fine pranks were discovered;—and there she shall remain, till I have a husband ready at the foot of the alter to receive her hand, and to take the wayward charge out of mine.</P>
<P>I do not recommend a nunnery as a school of mo∣rality; on the contrary, I think with Rousseau, that it is a nursery of coquettes; but since Mungo's receipt is found ineffectual (for we have lost the art of which the En∣glish once boasted padlocking the minds of our females, by a generous confidence and reasonable freedom;) since this will no longer restrain them, or rather since they no longer think it worth their while to deceive us, by an outward appearance of virtue, but sin with a high hand, and in the face of day;—since this, I say, is the case, the Spanish padlock must be substituted in lieu of the English.</P>
<P>I have placed bolts and bars, as guards upon my daughter; marriage alone shall release her from her pri∣son—she then becomes the property of her husband—if after that she commences the modern fine lady—his
<PB N="7" REF="018142_0006_0FA56294751A1DC0"/>
honor receives the principal wound—the disgrace glan∣ces only obliquely on me—her name, her condition is changed; from me he receives her pure—'tis his busi∣ness to keep her so—if not, he must take the conse∣quence. Ridiculous:—Unjust however, is that preju∣dice, which makes us confound the innocent with the guilty—but 'tis no longer the case—******* is now an honorable name—no longer the prerogative to city-husbands, but the high court fashion—a title of distinc∣tion. A woman of quality thinks it now a-days abso∣lutely necessary to be divorced, in order to establish the reputation of her beauty (that is, the only reputation of which she is ambitious!) The age of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hival<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is past—fighting is no longer in vogue—gallants are substitu∣ted in the room of knight-errants—no longer do we de∣fend and contend for our mistress's charms, by the force of arms, but we give a still more daring proof of their power—we marry the woman who has given us the strongest instance of weakness:—We take as our wives, the wantons whom our neighbours cast off—who have been publicly branded with infamy.—What folly!—What astonishing infatuation!—Our ancestors would have blushed at the bare mention of such depravity of morals; but we, their more polished sons, glory in our shame.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Harry; you know there is no stopping either my pen or tongue, when I stumble on this sub∣ject; but for once I will check myself—'tis hackneyed—all the world rail—but nobody looks at home, and begins the reformation so much wish'd for.</P>
<P>Let us return to the girls:—If you chuse to carry your's abroad, I'll accompany you.—I do not think, if she is the lively hussy you describe, she ought to be trusted with any other escort but yourself.—Yet why should I say, if she is this, or that; vice is not confined
<PB N="8" REF="018142_0007_0FA562952B9F6390"/>
to any particular temper or age. Who could have a more seducing appearance, a more promising disposition than my torment.—Mild as the gentle breeze of May—timid—blushingly modest—full of tender sensibility—her sentiments delicate and refined.—Often have I, in the days of foolish love and rapture, read to her Mil∣ton's fine description of Eve, and swore she sat for the amiable picture—
not obvious, not obstrusive—but retired.—</P>
<P>Such seemed to be her nature. Alass! too soon she threw off the mask. Do you know, Harry? No, you do not: Let me then spare myself the shame of confes∣sing my weakness. Harriot is the exact image of her mother: As a daughter, she acts with the greatest pro∣priety. No one can be more dutiful, more submissive, more affectionate; never has she uttered a single com∣plaint at her confinement,—but she is of a grave turn—vastly sentimental, forsooth;—in short, the very cha∣racter I have drawn above. But as I must from fatal experience, exclaim with the poet, "Frailty, thy name is <HI>Woman.</HI>"</P>
<P>So do I not place any manner of confidence in these favorable appearances; the foundation of my security is good substantial iron bars. Let me know, whether or no you choose to follow my example. Harriot is not much older than your daughter: her gravity and pru∣dence, however, will give her a sort of authority over your giddy girl, and may be a means of moderating her too great vivacity. If you determine to place her at the convent of B—, I will as I before said, accompa∣ny you in your expedition, and there we will leave from safe under lock and key, till we can find fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. Miss RIVERS to Miss ELIZA DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>OF how much happiness am I deprived by the loss of my sweet friend and companion. Dreary now appears this malancholy enclosure—so the world calls it; but never till my Eliza's departure did it wear a gloomy aspect to her Harriot; happy in your society, guarded by pious precepts from the love of a tumul∣tuous world, of which I know nothing, but from the description of those whose interest it now is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dwell only on the dark side of the picture.</P>
<P>I was perfectly content with my tranquil retreat: With what chearful alacrity did you and I enter in∣to our innocent amusements; not a moment of our time hung heavy on our hands;—but, since separa∣ted from you, I feel an aching void in my heart; our little recreations have, to me, lost their charms; I still see round me the same serene, contented coun∣tenances, but I see none to whom I can, with unli∣mited▪ freedom, unbosom myself: I like and esteem them; but 'tis a cool sentiment, compar'd to what I experienced for you. My judgment approves, but my affections are unengaged: Let me not however dam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="10" REF="018142_0009_0FA56296A7697E28"/>
your joy, at being again received into the arms of a ten∣der mother, by my complaints; rather let me congra∣tulate you on your felicity: A mother! O my friend! the very mention of that endearing name, fills my eyes with tears. Long, long, have I been deprived of mine: But, young as I was, when I enjoyed that ines∣timable blessing, strongly is it impressed on my me∣mory; I love to recollect her tenderness on these occa∣sions. I seem still to feel her kisses on my cheek, and fancy my self pressed to her maternal bosom. She is no more! Yet let me not repine, I have still a parent left: But it seems natural to our sex to be more fondly attached to the mother, than the father. I reverence the latter, but my affection is mixed with awe; a hasty word from him agitates my whole frame; while his smiles excite only a sort of doubtful joy: A joy, alloyed by the fear of inadvertently doing, or saying something that may dispel the sunshine of his counte∣nance, and substitute a cloud in its place. Whereas, had I a mother, I feel that my heart would expand itself in her presence; I would presume to make her the con∣fidant of all my little secrets: Her feminine softness would encourage me; on the contrary, my father's manly dignity, adds to my natural timidity; perhaps I should be more at ease in his presence, were I of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner ad∣mitted to it; but though he frequently takes a trip to Paris. I enjoy at the grate but little of his company: My first emotions at the sight of him, are always of the most agreeable nature; but he no sooner beholds me, than his native vivacity is exchanged for a melancholy pensive air; for some moments he continues lost in thought▪ his visits are short, and he seems to leave me without regret.</P>
<P>Perhaps, my dear, I have before now troubled you with the above remarks. Pardon me,—what led me to
<PB N="11" REF="018142_0010_0FA5629768460F00"/>
the subject, was a note, which I receiv'd from him this morning, informing me that he, my uncle (Sir Harry Richmond) and my cousin Isabella, will be here to∣morrow; the latter is, I fancy, coming to add to the number of our boarders; I never saw her, nor have I the least knowledge of her character; but as the daugh∣ter of my mother's sister, I am prepared to love her, and expect her arrival with that female impatience and curiosity, so natural to us. Lady Richmond I have seen, she favored me last winter with a visit, accom∣panied by my uncle; she is I think, without exception, the finest woman I ever saw, and as lively as she is hand∣some:—Sir Harry is no less distinguished for the charms of his person, so that I expect to behold in my little cousin, a perfect Venus; you know my dear, how fond I am of beauty—in others I mean. You will, perhaps, archly smiling, hint, that you could not suspect, I could mean in myself, since you know of none I have to be fond of; this some would say, therefore to save your friend from the imputation of vanity, I saved them the trouble: Do not call this affected humility: I will say no more on the subject.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. The SAME to the SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THEY are come my dear:—About eleven o'clock this morning I was summoned into the parlour, the outward parlour I mean, where we receive com∣pany, the lady abbess, and some of the sisterhood were
<PB N="12" REF="018142_0011_0FA5629913CCE0D0"/>
ready at the other side of the grate, to receive their new charge; my father entered, leading Isabella, followed by Sir Harry; I was struck with the uncommon beau∣ty of her person; she is very tall of her age, her air is graceful and animated; her travelling dress was ini∣mitably becoming; she changed colour at the sight of the nuns, and as it appeared to her, their gloomy en∣closure—ah! those iron bars!—cried she, with a faint smile, pointing to the grate, the very sight of them makes a free born English spirit revolt. I doubt not my dear cousin, said I, embracing her, but time will effectually reconcile you to our serene and tranquil joys. Serene and tranquil, repeated she, a pretty description, and admirably suited to the gravity of the no less pretty speaker: In saying this, she obligingly returned my caresses.—All the English boarders dressed to the best advantage, now by order of the abbess, made their ap∣pearance; this had before been requested by my uncle, who knew some of their parents: Here, said he, turn∣ing with a smile to my father, one might, I fancy, find that phoenix you despaired to meet with. 'Tis possi∣ble, returned the other in the same tone,—thanks to the strength of their impregnable garrison; but how long will they remain so when they get into the world? Sir Harry shook his head—pity they should ever come there, said he, to lose that engaging timidity, that sedu∣cing air of innocence, which is so charming! did wo∣men know their own interest would they wish effectually to enslave us; they would relinquish the <HI>bon ton</HI> for the antient simplicity of manners, and again become retired, which renders them the more to be desired. While her father spoke, Isabella remained buried in thought; the abbess several times addressed to her some po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te compliments, to which she answered only by a slight inclination of her head; at last starting from her
<PB N="13" REF="018142_0012_0FA56299DAB91C38"/>
reverie, she whispered me,—tell me, for heaven sake, Harriot, how do you make shift to kill your time amidst those set of inanimates?—ah! Lord,—they had better not admit me into their dreary prison, for I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a most unmerciful delight in plaguing them, poor dear souls. What a collection of winter-faced virgins are the nuns! It seems to me, that their vows were quite needless.</P>
<P>Some of them (the weather being extremely warm) had raised their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which gave her an opportunity to make this remark. After chatting about half an hour longer, Sir Harry said, that he wanted to have a little private conversation with the lady abbess, recom∣mending his daughter to my friendship, and promised to call again next morning.</P>
<P>On this my fair co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin and I paid our respects, she gave me her hand—I tremble, whispered she—the en∣trance into our prison is easy, but ah! how shall we get out again?—Her father over-heard her, and, in a half whisper, kissing her cheek, said, I will 'ere long, send you a knight errant, who shall set you at liberty; only to make me more effectually resign it—returned she archly, however send him—the sooner the better; <Q>for it is liberty, dear liberty alone, that gives fresh beauty to the sun:</Q> In warbling this air, she entered with me the pious dwelling.</P>
<P>What an ease, what a vivacity is there in the manner of this charming girl! how little is she restrained by the presence of her father, to what I am by mine! but this is easily accounted for, not only by the difference of our tempers, but by the difference of theirs: Sir Harry is gallant, polite, and gay;—my father is well b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, but it is mixed with a little haughtiness; he is sen∣sible, animated, and is, I fancy, naturally as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ively as the other; but he has met with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> life.—
<PB N="14" REF="018142_0013_0FA5629A8D8FCD40"/>
what I know not;—I only judge to by his manner, wherein one may discover a sort of affected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>;—affected I say,—for his native good humor fre∣quently breaks out in spice of himself, but he laughs as if he scorned himself for laughing.—You my dear have heard him expatiate on the conduct of our sex;—on this subject he is unmercifully satirical; the unfavora∣ble opinion he entertains of us, excites in me a laudable ambition, if possible, by my conduct, to make him do us more justice.</P>
<P>Amidst the crouds of a populous city, there are no doubt, many exceptionable characters, both male and female; but surely Eliza, our nature is not so depraved as some gloomy moralists pretend. Virtue at least is the very characteristic of our sex; those that forfeit that, forfeit the name of woman.</P>
<P>Adieu. Let you and I, my dear, ever study to de∣serve that amiable name, by modesty, delicacy, and gen∣tle timidity; which are all so many parts of our nature: For my share. I glory in being what I am; nor would all the prerogatives of which the lordly sex make their boast, tempt me to exchange the soft, the feminine wo∣man, for the bold, the less feeling man. However, were I even to undergo this unfavorable metamorphose my attachment to you would remain; as a female you excite my warmest friendship;—and were I a male, that friendship would be exchanged for love: This change would be so much more flattering to your vanity, that I fear I shall sink in value as what I am, when you consider what I might have been. But I forget,—I talk to you as if still in the convent, where lovers are so scarce; on the contrary, you are in the beaux monde, where every heart endued with sensibility, pays you that tender homage so justly your due.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. Miss RICHMOND to Lady BAB WILMOT.</HEAD>
<P>MY father talked of sending me to a convent. You laughed at my fears:—Impossible.—Your papa, my dear, too much admires a woman of spirit, to send his daughter abroad on any such gloomy er∣rand.—No child, he will rather encourage, than damp your charming vivacity; you have already all the modish airs and graces, which cost some of us (even women of fashion) so much trouble to acquire. Do you recollect who said all this to comfort her friend? Ah! lady Bab;—how much did flattering hope de∣ceive us? Look at the place from whence I date this woe-begone epistle, the convent of R—. You doubt your senses. Borrow your Aunt's specks, child;—look again;—alas! 'tis even so;—but do not be too much affected: not long will Bell Rich∣mond be confined. By what pretty method do you think I am to be released?—By marriage!—Delightful state of freedom, as our modern wives manage the af∣fair.</P>
<P>The poet makes Calista talk of the husband's impe∣rious reign, "proud with opinion of superior wisdom," but our modern dames have taught them better man∣ners. The tables are turned. 'Tis our reign now, not theirs, which then commences.—An unmarried woman is a mere cypher;—but when once the connu∣bial knot is tied, then pleasures golden reign begins:—then for gallants, intrigues, the dear Coterie, and to crown all, a divorce.—What charming methods have the ladies of this polished age discovered, to render marriage easy, Oh time! hasten that I may become

a wife; no matter to whom—I mean as to sense and figure; and indeed, for rank and fortune, we may trust our prudent parents, while we amuse ourselves with forming plans of future gaiety and expence. You know Bab, I am absolutely wild to enter the joyou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> state, I flatter myself I have talents to make some figure in it, and thanks to those who superintend my educa∣tion; I shall have none of those qualms of conscience to struggle with, which those often have who have been cooped up in a nursery till their hanging sleeves were taken off, and, from one extreme, are suddenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rown into another. Young as I am, I know the world; early was I introduced into scenes of gaiety; often have I stood at the elbow of my mamma, while she has lost a cool hundred at Brag!—By the by, Lady Bab, brag is one of the most delightful games in na∣ture—something in it so spirited—so fit for a woman of quality; I dare say I should soon become mistress of it. Ah! would I were now at the dear Coterie—learning the enchanting lesson; instead of which, behold me, in a melancholy cell, with a death's head and a weeping Magdalene placed on my toilet, in the room of patch-box and cosmetics. The poor unfortunate ***** of a penitent was depicted with a countenance so horribly rueful, that there was no standing it, if she had not, by her sister saints, been so effectually plaistered up against the wall, I should have taken the liberty to remove her; but since this (without tearing to atoms the sacred relict) could not be done, I have only with my pencil made a little reform in her face, and now she appears with dishevelled hair beating her breast, while her mouth is upon the broad grin: I never thought my drawing would have been of so much service to me.</P>
<P>I was so diverted at the odd appearance of the pic∣ture, when I had thus touched it up, that I determined
<PB N="17" REF="018142_0016_0FA562A1277D0A10"/>
to exercise my skill on some more of the <HI>memento mori's;</HI> accordingly, while the honest virgins were in the chapel, yawning over their beads I stole to their cells, and set their whole collection of saints a laughing; scarce a pic∣ture in the house, but what, with a few of my touches, I put into good humor, though before they were re∣penting in sackcloth and ashes. This is the least hu∣morous piece of mischief I have amused myself with since I came here, and, to say truth, hardly worth rela∣ting; but the Magdalene being facing me as I write, brought it to my remembrance: and whatever whim seizes me, whether in thought word or deed, you know I never check myself, so that if I am inclined to talk, or write nonsense, out it comes; it is a talent in which I excel: I know not how it may be relished by my own sex; but often have I by the most trifling prattle imagi∣nable, drawn off the attention of a circle of beaux, from plain sensible women, who were left to entertain each o∣ther, while they hung enraptured on the pretty follies that flowed from my ruby lips. Oh! Bab, when will those happy days of dear flirtation return?—Now I talk of wise women, I must tell you that I have met with a female cousin of mine, one of the demurest little toads you ever beheld; so sentimental,—delicate,—so timid,—so feminine,—so much the antediluvian—Ah I Lord, there is no bearing her: and yet it must be own∣ed, the girl has some agreeable talents, if she did but know how to make use of them: she has seen no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing of life; what share of polish she has, is entirely the gift of nature: there is something of a native grace about her, which one would not expect from a poor thing, shut up from infancy, in such a dreary mansion.

coquettes, amongst whom I have been accustomed to flourish: What I here mean by inanimate, is the want of that modish air of freedom, so conspicuous in the town bred belles; the loud laugh, the confident stare, which sets all rustic bashfulness at defiance. This kind of animation, is easily acquired; a couple of winters spent amongst people of fashion, will do the business; it has nothing to do with expression of countenance, or I should have no reason to tax my cousin with the want of it, for her features undisciplined by art, betray every sentiment of her heart: in her eyes, which are large, black, and languishing, one may see the sparkle of joy; the tear of pity, and the gentle beams of friendly sensi∣bility by turns: in short, they are such a pair of tell∣tale eyes, that I know not what she will do with them, when she comes to figure in the beau monde: her hair is dark, her complexion delicate, rather inclined to pale; she has good teeth, and a pretty mouth; yet will all this, is far from being a striking beauty; her's is of that kind, which will not please the generality of men; but those she does affect will be deeply so. See here a proof how void I am of envy; but my vanity is too strong to admit that humble vice.</P>
<P>I do not think Harriot is at all to be feared as a rival; she is in every thing so very opposite to your humble servant, that we shall never interfere with each other's conquests.—Conquests!

I am, for my part, asto∣nished, how your plain souls make shift to support their insipid existence?

<HEAD>LETTER VI. Mr. RIVERS to Sir HENRY RICHMOND.</HEAD>
<P>YOU curse your wife for obliging you, by her shameless conduct; to quit a place, so much to your taste, as this gay city: I on the contrary, hate it so heartily, that I could curse you, as I do with less scruple, the Count D—, for not suffering me more expeditiously to settle your business, that I may quit it: There is no prevailing on these laughing, fluttering trifling, giddy-brained mortals, to act like rational beings: I cannot get the Count to dispatch the affair, though it is so much his interest to bring it to a conclusion: How ridiculous! And yet, these are the people with whose manners you are so much enamoured: to me they are the most insignificant coxcombs in the creation, nothing can reconcile me to their fantastic follies: you will, I know, tell me, that if they can sing and dance through life, and set every care at defiance, they are a thousand

times happier than the snarling philosopher whose wisdom only serves to shew him the defects of his fellow crea∣ture, and how inadequate the joys of this world, are to communicate pleasure, to one who has refined his taste, even to wretchedness. Which of these two, you will ask, is the man timely wise? That wisdom which serves to render us miserable, deserves the name of folly; and so <HI>vice versa,</HI> that folly which serves to promote our fe∣licity, deserves the name of wisdom. This is your fa∣vorite doctrine: but a thousand such like arguments, would not make me a convert to your opinion; you may as well prefer madness to reason, or an agreeable dream to less pleasing realities. According to your system, the man who is, constantly intoxicated, is both wiser and happier than him that is sober: but are these sons of laughter really the happy beings you and they pretend? Impossible! I should think, void as they are of sensibility, fashion governs them in every thing; nature has given them no peculiar bias;—they make love—take snuff—fight—dress—run to public places—and profess friendship with the same indiffe∣rence.—I have no patience—I am sick of seeing perpe∣tually, in all I meet, the same insipid gaiety of counte∣nance; the laugh without a joke,—and of hearing a jingle of words without meaning.—Why, since you are so fond of them, did you leave them? Why is your honor so much easier wounded, than that of the people whose manners you so much admire? You was in no danger of being either despised or ridiculed for your wife's gallantries; they would rather congra∣tulate you on being united to one, who is so much mis∣tress of <HI>la bon ton:</HI> sure never any thing equalled the assurance of that woman! Far from being checked by my presence, she seems to watch for opportunities to throw herself in my way: Not often do I go to
<PB N="21" REF="018142_0020_0FA562A4286B59E0"/>
public places—but when I do, I am sure to meet her. The other night at the opera she made her ap∣pearance, blazing with jewels; I happened unfortu∣nately to place myself in the next box,—she had the impudence to curtesy to me; I was compelled to re∣turn the compliment: With this I could have put up, but fate had determined further to torment me. In coming out it was some time before my carriage could draw up; while I stood waiting for it, behold her again close at my elbow.—"Your servant Mr. Rivers," cryed she, <Q>long have I wished to have a little conversation with you;</Q>—"with me ma∣dam!" and I darted at her a look of ineffable con∣tempt.—<Q>Unparalleled assurance! why you far out∣strip your elder sister; she was a vestal when compar∣ed to you!—or to almost any other of her sex;—</Q> interrupted she, <Q>treat me as you please: but for hea∣ven's sake,—for your own sake—be more just to your injured wife;—upon my life Rivers she is in∣nocent.</Q>—I hurried into my chariot without deign∣ing to answer. She called to me, "stay one moment,—I have something of consequence!" I heard no more, I was glad to make my escape.</P>
<P>The subject in which she strove to engage me, is that, which of all others, is most trying to my natu∣rally impetuous temper. There is a foolish weakness hangs about my heart, which neither my reason or pride can conquer: I should have spent a horrid night: past scenes had taken strong possession of me; when my servant fortunately roused me from my disagreea∣ble reverie, by delivering a letter, the contents of which diverted my thoughts to another channel; it was from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate ward, Lord Oss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry: he tells me, that he has since his return from abroad, been constantly engaged in settling his houshold, and affairs relating
<PB N="22" REF="018142_0021_0FA562A5102FD068"/>
to his estate; that he is much pleased with his seat at—, and intends principally to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there; for which purpose, he has formed an extensive plan of im∣provements in the house and its in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irons which are going on with the utmost expedition, under the in∣spection of Monsieur La Fare, who has a most ele∣gant taste in these affairs. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remember right, you was present when my Lord related to me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> le∣man's unfortunate history; happy may he esteem himself in having met with so noble minded, so gene∣rous'a patron: infinite are the obligations he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his young protector; indeed I do not believe all England can produce a more amiable nobleman than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

I have often cautioned him against a too precipitate choice: but what avails our caution, when those against whom we would be upon our guard, are such adepts in hypocrisy and deceit, that they may bid defiance to the deepest pene∣tration? I lately wrote to him on this subject,—a report prevailing that he was on the point of taking this im∣portant, and, in general, as it proves, fatal step. I shall transcribe that part of his letter which is an answer to mine: But first let me own to you, that I cannot help forming a wish, since he is determined to play the fool and marry, that my girl might have the good fortune to please him; she is, I think, without partiality, as unexceptionable, in every respect, as most of her sex; nay, I know none who comes so near the description of her on whom he seems inclined to confer that ho∣nor:—read what follows, and I dare say you will be of my opinion. However, reason, as you and I have ex∣perienced, has very little to do in these affairs, while at

<P>YOU fear that my charming cousin, as you justly call her, will supplant in my affections, my absent friend—Are you really, Eliza, visited with such humble groundless apprehensions?—Ought I to pardon a sus∣picion so injurious to us both?—Yes, since in spite of self-love, you could be so unjust to yourself, I may cer∣tainly forgive your being so to me.—No, my dear, I do not think it possible, a friendship like your's and mine, can ever know decrease.—They say, people can love but once:—And I am tempted to think, that one can also but once in one's life, contract a sincere and genu∣ine friendship.—This singular way of thinking, seems to argue in me, a narrow and contracted heart: I hope it has not that fault; yet I own I cannot, like most young girls, form a variety of intimacies, and solicit the friendship of almost every new and agreeable face I meet with; I have one friend whom I love with an ar∣dor—a zeal which is not to be expressed.—I have also a few intimates, whose company gives me pleasure: but there are a hundred others, amongst the number of my acquaintance, who at the very first glance brought me, as my sprightly cousin calls it, to the freezing point; and with regard to them, it is in my heart winter all the

Without joking, this cousin of mine is constant∣ly engaged in some roguish prank or other: she has brought with her a whole collection of novels, and those of the most passionate side; one of these she contrived to place open upon the table of each of the nuns in their cells, in the room of their prayer-book, so that when they went to their devotions, instead of a prayer,—behold a <HI>bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>let doux.</HI>—It would fill a quire of paper to tell you half the tricks she has played the good creatures, since she was committed to their charge; a charge of which they are already heartily weary of.</P>

Your daughter's un∣common beauty for once was a disadvantage to her, as it helped me to trace out the place of her retreat—I left my servants and carriage at some distance from the house and after a few enquiries of the landlady, softly walked up stairs—threw open the door—when behold!

We

may therefore depend on their taking every precaution to prevent any intercourse between the young people.—I gave strict orders that no one shall upbraid my niece with what had happened: a violent spirit like hers, can only be governed by gentle methods. Harriot re∣ceived her with the utmost affection, without hinting at the cause of their separation; Bell silently, and rather sullenly returned her caresses.—She no doubt expected a lecture from the abbess; but not a soul in the house took the least notice of what had happened.—Thus all things are settled upon the most amicable footing.—I foresee however, that this calm will not be of any long duration.—Bell is not of a temper to brook confine∣ment.—Get her a husband, I again repeat.—She is not the kind of fruit which will keep.—I am in great hopes that my wishes in regard to Harriot, will be accom∣plished: I have excited Lord Ossory's curiosity to see her.—He proposes a trip to Paris in a few weeks; if he likes my girl we shall return to England.

Marriage—well then, since the man is so teasing on this head, I think I must even take him.—My father is good natured, I his only daughter; he is rich, the poverty of my lo∣ver is of the less consequence: in short, if they won't provide me with a husband, I must provide one for myself—to be cooped up in this odious house, prison I should say—where one's passions are doomed to starve; shut up between four walls,—I can bear it no longer.—Death or liberty.—On the strength of these wise re∣flections I made my escape, no matter how, reached Calais with my swain, from thence proposed to proceed to England.—When behold! contrary winds forced us to remain here at this sea-port; and what was still worse, blew my uncle to the place of our retreat, when we had sung, laughed and toyed away the time—Oh, Lady Bab,—<Q>What is life without passion, sweet passion of love.</Q></P>
<P>Well, I told you my uncle came to damp our joys.—He behaved like a man of sense—in a few words, he clearly shewed me my folly, the word beg∣gary dropped from his lips; away flew Cupid with extinguished fire. I looked at I' Abbe—my eyes were opened—beggary—all his graces vanished.—How could I be such an idiot!—'Tis a little insigni∣ficant

fellow.—What a figure I should make in the <HI>beau monde</HI> with such a husband!—Without fortune,—without rank,—my father inflexible:—ah Lord! "'Tis well it's no worse."—And yet, Lady Bab, I was exceeding indiscreet—I do not mean in regard to virtue, and such stuff—but I fear,—I fear,—hang it, we were both under age. I must not tell you all. I hate to recollect the foolish adventure: I terrified the poor silly youth, by letting him know, with the lan∣guage of my fingers, accompanied by a look still more intelligible, that for the present it was necessary to put myself again into the power of my friends; that we must endeavour to have patience; that I could not, wished not, to forget.</P>
<P>—Lady Bab, dear Lady Bab, I must, I will forget it.</P>
<P>I have, since my return to prison, found means, in spite of all their vigilance, to write to his sister, who has, on my account, been, to her great joy, ex∣pelled our community: in it I inclosed one for our little Abbe, bidding him rely on my constancy, and trust to my management for our re union, of which I did not despair, knowing the great influence I had over the heart of my fond father: I charged him not to stir in the affair; continue peaceably at your studies, (I say to him in my letter) till I return to England; cruel fate shall not after that, long separate hearts, which were formed for each other. When I get into that dear land of freedom, I will endeavour to be∣guile our tedious absence, by a constant intercourse of letters. If I find my father unexpectedly inflexible, then must we patiently wait till I am of age, when I shall become an independent mistress of a large for∣tune left me by my grand-father: (a fib this, Lady Bab: many, many, I shall be obliged to tell before

I can disentangle myself;—ah! if you knew all—but—but—) Then, continued I, my arms shall be open to receive you; no longer need we wait for the consent of parents—Let us my dear friend condole ourselves with this happy prospect;—and thus, I trust, have I got rid of a troublesome lover; and thus, I trust, have I also got rid of love; I mean of the ro∣mantic kind: now will I take the first good offer I meet with; never once will I stop to consult my in∣clinations; for I hold it as an infallible maxim, that no woman can properly govern her husband, or shine as a fine lady, a modern wife I mean, if she is so fool∣ish as to bestow her heart on the man, to whom she gives her hand—no, let all the love be on his side—the more fondly he doats the better; the easier task will she find it to make him her dupe—then if she has a mind to amuse herself with <HI>la belle passion</HI>—there are in charming London, a thousand handsome idle young fellows, who have nothing else to do but to furnish her with this amusement—Thus you see how sensibly I reason on these affairs, and how much I have profited by my early introduction into the <HI>beau monde.</HI> But the wisest of us may, at some critical moments, be off our guard.—This was my case with the little Ab∣be: for two long, long tedious months I had not seen the face of a male creature, except his: romances and iron bars had disordered my imagination,—I played the fool.—It cannot be recalled—I must do the best to prevent any ill consequences from the mad headed expedition. My demure cousin does not upbraid me with my imprudence; but her eves speak, though her tongue is silent: before this adventure I regarded her with a sort of neutrality; but now I heartily hate her, because I cannot help feeling a kind of humbling in∣feriority: the time may come, when I will either bring

<HEAD>LETTER XI. CHARLES RIVERS, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to Sir HARRY RICHMOND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS daughter of yours was born to torment me: but I intend to give you a minute account of the affair, and therefore will not anticipate.—Last night arrived in Paris, the Right Honorable Lord Ossory, who will neither find his equal here, nor has he left his equal for every engaging quality, behind him. After our first congratulations were over, he ex∣pressed his impatience to see Harriot; her idea, said he, haunts me perpetually; and yet my good friend, in spite of the strong prepossessions I experience in her fa∣vor, fate may not have destined me the happiness of being allied to you; I must take the liberty to hope, that my choice is still free, and that no offence will be taken—he paused:—I easily understood his meaning, and as easily dissipated his delicate apprehensions; he took his leave, promising to attend me next morning at twelve to the important interview.</P>
<P>I wrote a note to Harriot, informing her of our in∣tentions; but in regard to Lord Ossory, I only said, I shall bring with me a young gentleman who is desirous
<PB N="37" REF="018142_0036_0FA562B5B3FB9248"/>
of being introduced to you. I own I did not wish Bell to be present, therefore forebore to mention her in my billet—the hour arrived,—and punctual to his time his Lordship arrived also elegantly dressed;—we set off; during our little ride, he was visibly agitated, I was not myself absolutely indifferent as to the issue of our visit.</P>
<P>Harriot made her appearance with a modest air and downcast eye, she gave, by her not having in the least degree altered the plain dress she wears in common, a proof that she had either very little vanity, or a great deal of pride; this at first glance appears a paradox. Rousseau has explained it in the description of his So∣phia: her dress however, is always elegant and simple, and seemingly unstudied; she looked pretty, at least in my eyes; the sentimental expression of her countenance, would, I thought, suit the taste of Lord Ossory.</P>
<P>She received me with her usual respect, then turn∣ed to his Lordship, who I presented to her; she timidly raised her eyes to his face, instantly her's was suffused with blushes; but a moment after, she grew pale: in a faltering accent she returned his compli∣ment. I never saw her so embarrassed; he on the contrary appeared perfectly at ease; he examined her with attention, but in a manner delicately cautious lest his glances should add to her already apparent confusion: not a look of either escaped my notice. I had no reason to be pleased with the serenity in his; I saw only a cool approbation: but in hers,—I wish the girl may be able to stop at that. While things were in this situation, a sister came to inform me, that my niece begged leave to pay her respects—sly gipsy, she had seen my note:—not to me, but to Lord Os∣sory did she intend the compliment—In she swam, adorned with all the charms that nature could bestow, and embelished with every ornament which a delicate
<PB N="38" REF="018142_0037_0FA562B747E3CE50"/>
female fancy could select; I never saw such a blaze of charms. Harriot, for the first time in her life. I must do her the justice to believe, felt a momentary sensa∣tion of envy; she changed colour, and involuntarily retreated a few paces to make way for her too power∣ful rival.—This motion seemed to say—I give up the unequal contest.—Bell approached the grate with all the town-bred ease of a fine lady—graceful her air, insi∣nuating her smiles. Lord Ossory was transfixed into a statute—the statute of admiration—she spoke—the harmony of her voice, her sprightly wit completed her triumph.—He gazed, he listened with rapture,—in∣voluntary praises burst from his lips.—I had seen enough—too much, so arose to take my leave:—with visible reluctance, he followed my example: his eyes quitted not the lovely object, till the envious door shut the delightful vision from his sight. I was not in a hu∣mor to hear him tell me, as I saw he was preparing to do, that my girl had not answered his expectations. I therefore pretended indispensible business, and politely paying my compliments, hurried from him. And now Sir Harry I expect to see you here That your daughter has made a conquest is past a doubt; the alli∣ance is every way desirable,—pardon me, but I must say, that it is much better than she deserves:—her late adventure, I do not mean to call her virtue in question, we must however allow that it was highly indiscreet. I check my pen on this subject, there is a late in mar∣riage—always have I remarked that to hear a batchelor, who is not in love, describe his future wife, is positive∣ly to know that when he comes to make his choice, she will be the very reverse of what he then thinks he shall approve.—O man! of what use is thy boast∣ed reason! Adieu! let me know it I may hope for your presence. My first prospect has been fruitless,
<PB N="39" REF="018142_0038_0FA562B7A551ECB0"/>
but I have another in reserve, of the success of which. I cannot doubt:—my old friend Mrs. Williams, has made overtures for her son,—the young man is neither to be much liked, or much disliked—one of the com∣mon medly mortals, that make up the throng.—It is time my girl were settled in life,—till then, I shall ne∣ver be truly at ease, nor can I till then indulge my∣self in my wish for retirement. Mr. Williams then must be the man,—instantly will I write to his mother:—my daughter has been accustomed to obey,—on her part I fear not any opposition: this is my present plan, come and see it executed.—I think we have now a fair pros∣pect of getting rid of both our plagues.—Farewel, be∣lieve me</P>

<P>I Have for the present silenced my little Abbe—have obtained his solemn promise not to stir in the affair, but to leave the management of it wholly to your hum∣ble servant.—You find then the poor soul is not totally void of understanding, since he has sense and discern∣ment enough to discover, that mine is so much superi∣or.—But let us have done with this foolish adventure, I have one of a far more agreeable nature or relate.—Harriot, the other night, received a note from her fa∣ther—she bro't it to me—it promised her the company of a beau next morning, not the least palpitation did this cause in the little demure one, not so <HI>my</HI> experien∣ced heart, it knows the full value of a new conquest:

And do you make no alteration?—And yet, checking myself ere I finish the indiscreet question, it would be needless trouble; your dress, though plain, is inimitably becoming (a fib this as you may suppose Bab, for her cap absolutely disguised her) you are too hand∣some, returned she smiling, to practice the little mean arts, of which some of our sex condescend to be guilty. I believe you speak as you think, but in general, I am sorry to say it, if one asks a female friend's opinion of these matters, one may almost be sure, she will advise you to wear what will be of the least advantage to your charms—a shrewd remark, to be made by so very good a creature; she knows more of her sex than I imagined.—A sister entered—your papa, Miss Harriot, and another very fine gentlemen wait for you: away she tripped to receive the homage of her swain, and I to my faith∣ful glass, by whose aid I hoped, ere long, to share that homage with her—I dressed, animated with the dear prospect of a new conquest: I omitted no ornament that could add to my beauty: my heart palpitated—my cheeks glowed—my eyes sparkled—and, before I left the agreeable task, every charm blazed forth with unusual lustre—down I flew unsummoned.—Well worth my pain was the conquest I have made,—Yes Bab. I have effectual done his business.—Poor soul I how eagerly he drank in the deliciously poison, that I darted from my love inspiring eves; then had you seen my crest falling cousin, with such a dolorous counte∣nance

I make no doubt of becoming his help mate, his wife we will ra∣ther say, for I know no one living thing in which I shall help him, but to spend his money.—Do you want a more particular description of his person—a true female.—But child, you forget I intend him for my husband, and in that case you know one regards not such trifles; however, I think I told you above, that he is handsome; I could wish he was less so; and yet, I hope I shall not be so weak as to love him.—To say truth, the man is not without his attractions; but if I was to entertain a slight partiality for the wretch, matrimony is an effectual remedy; besides, I am of so fickle, so inconstant a na∣ture, that I defy the finest man in England, to fix, for a week together my fluttering heart.—But a husband!—heavens!—the very sound of the word extinguishes each load desire.—Lord Ossory then is, as he ought to be sufficiently indifferent to your humble servant.—Not so my little cousin—with far different eyes does she view him.

Misled by a lively fancy, I was strongly possessed with an idea, that in her's I should find my destined heart; and to do her justice, next to her lovely cousin, she is the most amible girl I ever met with. I know not what impression she might hate made, tho' I was not immediately struck with her charms, which are of that kind, that gently, and by degrees insinuate them∣selves, and fix a lasting empire in the heart: I know not I say, but she in time might have fixed my choice, had not the transporting Isabella made her appearance, with such a superior, such a ravishing blaze of beauty, that she perfectly dazzled my senses, and rendered me blind to every other object but herself;—no longer had reason any thing to say in the affair:—astonished—over powered by her charms, I have ceased to be a free agent, and at the first became her slave.—Well is it for me, that she has merit as well as those powerful perso∣nal attractions; for I feel, let her mind have been what it would, I was irresistably doomed to love, however un∣worthy she might have been of my esteem: But thank heaven this is not the case, for she is all that mortal man could wish. Mr. Rivers seemed disappointed, but not offended at my being compelled to decline the honor of his alliance; he appears however, less pleased than I could wish, at that I am going to enter into with Sir Henry Richmond: out of regard for him, I as much as possible, restrain in his presence, the overflowings of my heart in regard to my Isabella, but when I involun∣tarily do justice to her merit, he looks dissatisfied; tells me, with a forced smile, that love is blind, that if my passion was more modera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would stand a better chance to be lasting: this kind of behaviour, however, in him, is easily accounted for: the unfortunate conduct of his wife, has given him an unfavorable opinion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but never shall the children, with me, suffer for the sins

I fear her fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is irrevocably fixed; the timid maid will never have courage to oppose the will of an arbitrary father, whom she has, from childhood, been accustomed implicitly to obey:—the prospect of her misery—for what else can be the consequence of so ill concerted an union?—damps my happiness—: ac∣cursed be that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elfish heart, which feels only for it∣self—mine is not of that number. I saw her this morning, and ever since then, in spite of the charms of Isabella, she has ingrossed a great part of my thoughts.—If I have formed a true idea of my love∣ly mistress, she would esteem me the more for inte∣resting myself in the welfare of her, who is not only a relation, but a friend.</P>
<P>I wish I could prevail on Mr. Rivers to change his purpose; but in these affairs he is unpersuadably obstinate; he has no tenderness for the sex; he is more studious of his own ease than of his daughter's happiness; disgusted with the world, he wishes to fly to retirement: but ere he can gratify his favorite whim, he thinks it necessary to put his Harriot un∣der the protection of a husband: from the fatal con∣duct of her mother he has lost all confidence in wo∣man kind; he trembles for his honor, should he trust her in the world; from infancy, he has confi∣ned her to the gloomy enclosure of a nunnery, nor dare he take her from thence, till a husband's arms are open to receive her.—Poor Harriot! I accompa∣nied him this morning, as I before said, on a visit to her, and my angel: the latter did not for some time make her appearance:—if she has any foible, it is a too great regard for dress: I have often to wait till she has finished the labors of the toilet.—How un∣necessary
<PB N="50" REF="018142_0049_0FA562C3E4EF8160"/>
are ornaments to a form like her's by na∣ture so complete. Ah! could she, if she loved like me, waste that time in trifles, which would be so much more delightfully employed in the mutual ef∣fusion of two enamoured hearts? Harriot is as indif∣ferent about that, to most female's important affair, as the other is fond of it; there is in her appearance an elegant neatness, which I hardly ever saw so happily blended in any other woman: she has, as I told you, been indisposed, therefore she came down to us in her morning dress. A spotless white muslin, sprigged by her own fair hands, and trimmed with fine point; her ruf∣fles of the same, as was her cap, made like that worn by country girls, adorned with a pale pink ribbon: it is im∣possible to give you an idea of the very pretty unstudi∣ed simple air this same cap gave her face—rendered the more dazzling fair and delicate, by her la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e illness:—a black velvet bracelet round each lovely arm; a collar of the same around her neck; on my word I never beheld such an inviting object, though I may have seen (my Richmond for example) more striking dazzling beauties: and shall this insinuating gentle maid be sacri∣ficed to a wretch like Williams?—poor Harriot! why is it not in my power to save you from such unme∣rited misery!—A modest blush on her entrance gave her additional charms; a momentary blush, for soon the rose gave place to the lilly; her father took her hand, and softened by her plaintive air, tenderly en∣quired after her health: she sighed, and a tear stole down her cheek. Change of air, continued he, will, I hope, be of service to you: are you well enough recovered, think ye, to undertake a voyage to England? do you not long to be released from your confinement, my dear? This kind speech he accompanied with a smile. Alas! Sir, returned she, sighing, what joy can that
<PB N="51" REF="018142_0050_0FA562C56DFD3568"/>
prospect give me?—Then I shall only exchange a pri∣son, which I never found irksome, for a more lasting, a dreadful bondage. O Sir! pity me; let me, if you dare not trust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the world but in a married state, still continue within this pious enclosure.—My religion forbids me to take the veil: but most cheerfully, most contentedly will I live single, a pensioner for life, since you chuse not to rely on my discretion, since you have unhappily imbibed an unfavorable opinion of our sex. Trust at least these bolts and bars—let all my motions be strictly watched—place over me a guard as vigilant as you please, never will I murmur;—only spare your child, and sacrifice her not to a man she cannot love.—And how know you that you cannot love him? cried her father sternly. O, Sir, the character I have heard:—And from whom, interrupted he, still more exaspe∣rated, from your giddy cousin? He then uttered some invectives against my Isabella, which I cannot bear to repeat, nor did I calmly hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her censured. He apo∣logized for the warmth of his temper.</P>
<P>I am interrupted, my dear La Fare.—'Tis of no consequence.—I only wished to repeat the conversa∣tion, that you might join with me in admiring Miss Rivers's just and truly refined sentiments. What a charming description did she give of what matrimony might be, were a union of hearts to be the foundation I And how effectingly did she paint the misery that must be the consequence of that with which she is threatened! But all her eloquence was lost on her inflexible father.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. Miss RIVERS to Miss ELIZA DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>CHIDE me not, my dear Eliza▪ my spirits are weak. I have been ill. I could not write. But ah! never injure me so far as to suspect I could forget my beloved, my only friend. What is the matter with my eyes? They flow incessantly. Indeed I have but too much cause to weep. O that you were here, that in your sympathizing bosom I might hide my blushes, while I reveal my weakness. I die with shame even when my heart whispers to myself the fatal secret. Why, alas, was this most amiable of men thrown in my way? A hopeless passion consumes me;—but this is not all. Patiently would I endea∣vour to submit to my own wretched fate; but to know that he is also doomed to misery, 'tis too much. Eliza, his rash choice will be his ruin. That artful dissembler, my cousin, by wearing before him the mask of hypocrisy, has shewn herself to me in her true colours. I know her utterly unworthy of his heart. Think not that I view her with the malig∣nant envious eye of a rival. Would it were so. Alas! I have convincing proofs how little she is formed to contribute to his felicity. Their taste, their disposition, opposite as light and darkness; with what anguish do I behold the sensible, amiable, unsuspecting youth, duped by her artifice! But who shall attempt to unde∣ceive him? Alas! too soon his own fatal experience will convince him of his error. How he idolizes her charms! with what fervor, yet delicate tenderness does he manifest his passion! She affects to love with equal ardor, while she cannot conceal, even from me, her
<PB N="53" REF="018142_0052_0FA562C8159B24A8"/>
triumph, at having so artfully imposed on him. In∣deed, Eliza, a heart like her's is incapable of that pas∣sion. She has not one grain of tender sensibility in her composition. If she had, no man on earth is more formed to awaken it than Lord Ossory. There is in his countenance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat winning, irresistable some∣thing, that is far more seducing than the most regu∣lar beauty. His eyes, such softness, such expression, so languishingly sweet! Fatal to your poor Harriot has been their tender glances; for tender they are even to me; he cannot divest them of it, the language of love is so natural to them. From the attentive com∣placency with which he treats me, I flatter myself that I may, in time, aspire to the honor of his friend∣ship; with that I must endeavour to be satisfied. It will also, alas, soon be criminal to view him in any other light. Every thing is now in readiness for our return to England. Soon shall I have the hap∣piness to embrace my Eliza. That pleasing hope supports my drooping spirits—well may they droop.—I have not yet told you half my misery. I can∣not bear either to think or write on the horrid sub∣ject.—Let me not dwell on it. In a few words, my father is determined to sacrifice me to a wretch. Eliza, it must not, cannot be; death will free me from his cruel power, and nothing but death can, I fear, save me from the threatened misery. My tears, my entreaties are ineffectual; he is even deaf to Lord Ossory's persuasive eloquence! that generous noble∣man has condescended to become my advocate; but, alas, all he has been able to procure for me is a few month's respire. Those months, O my friend, where do you think they are to be passed? With the happy, happy bride, at her lord's country seat. Sir Harry has a small, but pleasantly situated lodge in the neigh∣bourhood,
<PB N="54" REF="018142_0053_0FA562CA1F5126A0"/>
where my father and he propose to take up their residence, that the former may be near enough to watch over the conduct of his unfortunate girl. The odious Williams is also to be Lord Ossory's guest. Think▪ then, Eliza, what your Harriot must suffer from such a situation; a mortified witness of her rival's felicity—pestered with the addresses of the man she hates—spies placed over her—a hopeless passion to combat with, at the very time she is under the same roof with the object who inspired it;—she must see him daily—must daily converse with him, and yet cease to love.—What a task!—All that is possi∣ble I will attempt. Either I must conquer it, or it will conquer me, and lay me in the silent tomb. No matter how soon. This scene of vanity closes on me. Who would wish to be a restless inhabitant of this disorder'd world? I feel a reluctance to lay down my pen, it is a great relief to me to pour my griefs in∣to your gentle bosom. You must permit me, when we meet, to renew the melancholy theme.—This is the last letter you will receive from me, dated from the dear, the peaceful convent. I grieve to think of my parting from the amiable women with whom I have spent so many tranquil years. In a convent, as well as in the world, there is a mixture of good and bad; but in this house the good is happily predominant. Many of the nuns, from sense, sweetness of disposition, and unaffected piety, are entitled to our greatest respect. In this I am sure Eliza will agree with her</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. From the SAME to the SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AT length the important day—the day which to Lord Ossory was a day of exquisite love and rap∣ture, the day which to Isabella was a day of triumph and exul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, and the day which in your poor Har∣riot's breast excited such various emotions, is passed good, blessed as it was to some, like other days it ends in night: all the world but your unfortunate friend are retired to rest,
"Sleep lights on lids unsullied with a tear."</P>
<P>Mine are not of that number, I must not therefore expect a visit from the welcome guest, instead of it, I sit down to fulfil the promise I made—My dear Eliza, you are too virtuous, too amiable to gain the good gra∣ces of my cousin.—I know she would not like you, but I thought she would have included you in our party, that she might the better carry on the farce of friend∣ship to me, (how my disposition is changed) I am be∣come suspicious, censorious,—nay, even I fear a little en∣vious—but I cannot—do not—Ah! how should I love Lady Ossory (must I call her) Well my dear, the plea∣sure of your company, your presence which I never more stood in need of, was denied me. With what soothing gentleness did you endeavour, the night before, when I bad you a reluctant adieu, to arm my weak heart for the approaching dreadful trial. Yet in spite of all your sensible arguments I arose next morning, without hav∣ing once closed my eyes, more dead than alive, trem∣bling, agitated to such a degree, that I could hardly keep myself from fainting, while my maid put on me those ornaments, which I was obliged to wear in honor of the happy bride. When the task was finished I dis∣missed
<PB N="56" REF="018142_0055_0FA562CB384040D8"/>
her, and raising my eyes to the glass, beheld a face so pale, so pathetically moving, (if I may so express myself) that I burst into tears, which flowed the faster, for my gazing on my streaming eyes:—Thus was I indulging a sad luxury of grief, when I received a sum∣mons to breakfast. It was some time ere, by breathing on my handkerchief, I could render myself fit to make my appearance: I endeavoured to muster up a little pride. Weak, imprudent Harriot, cried I, Lord Ossory does not love you, it is true, but why will you also compel him to despise you.—This thought roused me: I hurri∣ed down least the impression of it should wear off; there I found the most amiable of men, seated by his spark∣ling, smiling Isabella, holding between both his, her passive hand; his fine eyes fixed on her's with such in∣expressible delight, transported with her charms; she engrossed every faculty of his soul. I felt at that mo∣ment emotions for which I detest myself.—I started, and put up an ejaculatory prayer, for grace to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quer the corruptions of my fallen nature: I recollected Milton's description of the d—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when be contemplated the hap∣piness of our first parents. Ah! cursed envy, never more shall you find room in my heart!—You have seen—You admire my cousin's uncommon beauty; but on this her bridal day, that beauty shone out with redoubled lustre; well it might, for—ah! how inviting, how de∣lightful were the smiling prospects which opened to her view; light were her spirits, easy her deportment, no rustic bashfulness, no timid modesty to embarrass her:—but let me resume the thread of my story.—The company whom I found assembled in the breakfast par∣lor, were, besides the bridegroom and bride, Sir Henry Richmond, Lady Bab Wilmot, and my father. This fine lady of quality is my cousin's confidant and bosom, friend, and well are their dispositions suited to each other.
<PB N="57" REF="018142_0056_0FA562CBE65FDA40"/>
I know not whether or not you recollect her, but I re∣member she was at St. James's square, the first time I embraced my Eliza after my return to England.—Bell and her retired soon after you came in, I dare say she escaped your notice: it is indeed that of the other sex which she alone wishes, and labors to attract—In this she is, thanks to her rank, tolerably success∣ful; her person is naturally passable, but she renders it ridiculous and disgusting by her unsufferable affecta∣tion; she is lively, haughty, coquette and satirical. This slight description may suffice for my sister bride∣maid, who had omitted no ornament that could supply the defects of nature. The little bustle she made in pay∣ing her compliments to me, which like other fine ladies, she always does in a high key, made Lord Ossory turn his head; he rose politely, led me to a seat; with a sort of tender pity pressed my hand;—<Q>you have not yet my sweet cousin,</Q> said he, <Q>recovered the fa∣tigue of your voyage, but I hope the fresh country air, to which we are hasting, will produce a favorable change.</Q> I forced a smile, looked my gratitude for his kind attention to my health, but durst not trust my voice. He again placed himself by his blooming Isabella, she did not however now so wholly engross his attention but that he sometimes addressed his plea∣sing discourse to me, and that always in the gentle soothing voice of friendship; Lady Bab, for want of a younger beau, flirted with my uncle, whose person is still excessively agreeable, and who has all the gal∣lantry and vivacity, requisite to the character of a fine gentleman. My father had been amusing himself with the newspapers; but soon after I came in, he beckoned to me; I followed him to a window at some distance from the rest of the company. <Q>I had always intended,</Q> said he, <Q>to let you re∣main
<PB N="58" REF="018142_0057_0FA562CCB19D6E68"/>
abroad, ▪till I had provided a husband for you; in part I have kept my resolution. This husband is provided; and had I not been teased out of my plan, you would this day have follow∣ed your cousin's example. I already begin to re∣pent my weak compliance with your caprice. A strange weight hangs on my spirits. I dread the consequence of unnecessary delay: I have yielded but to—what purpose can it answer; you must ere long, give your hand to Mr. Williams; nothing shall tempt me to violate the promise I have made both to him and his mother; I expect therefore that you will conquer your foolish prejudice, and prepare yourself to receive him as your intended husband: Lord Ossory has, at my request invited him to be present at his nuptials, in a few moments he will be here.</Q> (I started and changed colour.) "None of your female airs and graces," continued my father; <Q>I am determined not to be trifled with; your fate is determined; I called you aside in order to prepare you for his visit: this you must allow is acting with all the tenderness of a parent; do you in return, act with that submissive duty which be∣comes a child. You never saw the man, therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alk like a foolish girl when you say you cannot love him: he is young, handsome, rich, and (what is still better) a man of morals.</Q>—As he spoke this we heard a loud rap at the door: It is him, exclaimed I, with a terrified emotion, and sunk almost fainting into a chair. I was not mistaken: in a few moments, a tall▪ aukward figure entered the room, dressed with inelegant finery, tho' early in the morning—I was going, my dear Eliza, to repeat the foolish compliments he paid me; but I have not patience to dwell on the hated subject: his conversation was interlarded with scraps of plays, the
<PB N="59" REF="018142_0058_0FA562CE162DC3D0"/>
bombast of which, mixed up with his own home-spun country dialect, ▪formed a most ridiculous contrast, and might truly be called the art of sinking in poetry. Du∣ring breakfast, I contrived to make my escape to the other side of the table, leaving him next to Lady Bab, who was pleased with an opportunity of shewing her talents for wit and ridicule: she played him off most unmercifully, to the great entertainment of Sir Harry, and the great displeasure of my father, who severely chid me with his eyes for having changed my seat. Odious as this man appears to me, when viewed in the light of a husband,—yet, when I considered him un∣connected with myself, I was sorry to see him made a butt of. Want of sense is the fault of nature; not he that labors under this defect, but those who take advantage of it, are the persons who ought to excite our contempt. As Miss Richmond had insisted on being married with a special licence, we had not what she called the vulgar parade of going to church. A∣bout twelve, we retired to the drawing room, where the ceremony was performed by the bishop of Lon∣don, who is related to the family.—The bride ap∣peared perfectly at ease while repeating those vows, the solemnity of which made me tremble. I ventur∣ed to steal a glance at Lord Ossory in his amia∣ble countenance, I beheld all the marks of genuine piety,—with a composed and manly voice, he plight∣ed his faith,—it was plainly to be seen, that his heart se∣conded his lips, while he swore to live for her alone, till death should dissolve their union—A shivering seized me—ah! then, said I, from this moment I must tear the dear image from my breast,—from this moment to love thee is a crime.—Now then, Harriot kneeling at the foot of the altar, make a sacrifice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy hopel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, unfortunate passion: Lord Ossory is lost to thee for∣ever!
<PB N="60" REF="018142_0059_0FA562CE26B48DD8"/>
Assist me Heaven!—Agitated with these pain∣ful emotions, my eyes grew dim, my head grew gid∣dy, and I sunk senseless on the carpet. When I recover∣ed, I found myself on my bed; my maid stood by the side of it, and my father at some distance; I uttered a deep sigh; he approached, <Q>Harriot, child what is the matter with you; your illness has thrown a damp over the general joy; you have delayed our journey; Lord Ossory would not set out without you. Poor Mr. Williams is in despair; indeed you have greatly alarmed us all.</Q>—"I am sorry for it Sir," replied I <Q>but I beg they will no longer wait for me; I am not sufficiently recovered to make one of the happy party.</Q>—<Q>But indeed you must, my amiable cou∣sin,</Q> cried an insinuating voice, which I knew to be Lord Ossory's, <Q>this smoaky town will never agree with your delicate constitution.</Q> He advanced and took my hand as he spoke this; I blushed, and con∣scious of my weakness, too hastily withdrew it, then wept for fear I had betrayed myself.—But pardon me, Eliza, I am tiresomely minute; it would fill a quire to describe half the painful emotions—the struggles of my heart, during a day which to me appeared an age. I must lay down my pen, not able to hold it any longer; quite overpowered with fatigue, I will throw myself on the bed.—How delightful is the situation of this house, so elegant—ah! I can say no more—adieu! adieu! I am in the next apartment to Lord Ossory,—peaceful and refreshing ever be his slumbers.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. The SAME to the SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AT length I return to my favorite amusement. I have been very ill my dear Eliza. My fever was violent while it lasted. To-day, for the first time. I took a short airing, accompanied by my maid. The rest of the family are too much engaged with their plea∣sures to dedicate any of their time to a poor, low-spirit∣ed invalid: I ought however, in justice, to except the amiable Ossory. Nothing could equal his friendly anxiety for me during my illness. Every hour of the day did he call at the door of my apartment to enquire how I did. The most skilful physicians, were, by his order, sent for from town—my father also behaved with a tenderness which excites in my breast the warmest sentiments of gratitude. But it was my cousin on whom I meant justly to reflect, when I talked of being ne∣glected: neither her or her friend Lady Bab once con∣descended to honor me with a visit; both violently ap∣prehensive of fevers, it seems. Such was their excuse. Mr. Williams, honest man, never having been accus∣tomed to think or act for himself, did as he saw the rest do. When they expressed sorrow for my illness, he endeavoured to look sorrowful; when they sent up to enquire after me, he followed their lead, and joined in the ceremony. This account I had from Sally, who added, that he was very assiduous about Lady Bab Wilmot. Heaven grant she may have made a con∣quest of him. I doubt not but her Ladyship would snap at such an offer, as her rank is much superior to her fortune. I was near a fortnight confined to my room, and still find myself extremely weak and languid. My indisposition needed not to have confined me so
<PB N="62" REF="018142_0061_0FA562CFA6E11C18"/>
long, but I wished to be retired: I trembled at the thoughts of being again exposed to the too attractive graces of Lord Ossory's conversation. I spent my time in endeavouring, by the aids of religion and philosophy, to cure my heart of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s now criminal weakness. I flat∣tered myself that I had, in some measure, succeeded; and therefore entered the parlour where the company were assembled with an air of composure, placing great confidence in the strength of my laudable resolutions. Fortunately Lord Ossory had rode out to pay some morning visits, and was not yet returned. I found only Lady Ossory, Lady Bab, my uncle, Mr. Williams, and Monsieur La Fare. The latter sat by my cousin, tuning her guitar; Sir Harry was engaged at piquet with Lady Bab; and Mr. Williams was amusing him∣self with her ladyship's netting, at which he is very ex∣pert. Such was the arrangement of the little party. Lady Ossory looked like an angel; the country air had given an additional glow to her fine complexion; and her morning dress was inimitably becoming. The agreeable Frenchman seemed, by the homage he paid her with his large black eyes, to be perfectly sensible of her attractions. You must permit me to give you a slight sketch of this gentleman's history. As Lord Ossory's friend, he deserves the honor of being intro∣duced to my Eliza. I know not myself the particulars of his story, which, I am told, is uncommonly unfortu∣nate: all I have hitherto learnt is, that he is descend∣ed from a younger branch of a noble family; that in consequence of a love affair, he fought a duel, and killed his antagonist, whose rank and power being superior to his, obliged him to fly his country, where no pardon was to be hoped for; that in leaving his country he was also obliged to leave all he had, escaping only with his life.—He changed his name,
<PB N="63" REF="018142_0062_0FA562D070219820"/>
and fled to Holland, I think it was at Brussels; that fortune, weary of persecuting him, presented him with an opportunity of rendering a signal service to Lord Ossory, who was on his travels. Of what nature this service was. I have not yet been infor∣med; but from that moment the generous young Englishman took him under his protection. He ac∣companied his patron hither: as soon as they arrived here, Lord Ossory, whose favors are rendered dou∣bly valuable, by the noble delicacy with which they are conferred, made him independent, by settling on him a very considerable annuity; he lives with his bene∣factor from choice; is treated with so much respect by all the domestics, and has so much command in the family, that one can hardly tell which of the two is mas∣ter. My Lord doats on him: and indeed he is so sensi∣ble, so agreeably gay, and in every respect so accom∣plished, that one cannot wonder that he should gain such an ascendency over his worthy friend. He has, it seems, proposed himself, as a proof of his gratitude, to become tutor to Lord Ossory's son and heir, if hea∣ven should bless him with one—a task for which he ap∣pears admirably qualified. For this purpose, he is en∣gaged in abridging Rosseau's System of Education,—selecting what is practicable, and omitting what he and Lord Ossory think exceptionable. This man is tho't, by the belles of our society, uncommonly handsome: he is very well for a foreigner;—but I must own, his chief recommendation to me is, his being honored with the friendship of Lord Ossory. This subject has run away with my pen. I was going to describe the recep∣tion I met with.—Mr. Williams was the first who espi∣ed me. As I entered the room, he started up, and with ridiculous emphasis repeated,</P>
<L><PB N="64" REF="018142_0063_0FA562D1255BF318"/>
"Angels and ministers of grace defend us.</L>
<L>"Art thou, &amp;c.</L>
<P>Then advancing, led me to a chair, and swore I looked divinely.—<Q>Since you allow her to be a heavenly ghost,</Q> cried Lady Bab, laughing, <Q>your question of 'bring'st with thee blast from hell,' was needless. It must be owned,</Q> added she, <Q>you have a pretty and very uncommon style of complimenting your mistress. To have called her an angel, is what any fool might have done; but to call her a ghost was indeed a superior stretch of folly.</Q> <Q>Mr. Willi∣ams,</Q> said Sir Harry, <Q>has shews great judgment in the choice of a wife; he is a body, and if man and wife become one, he will then also have a soul.</Q> "But I fear," cried Mr. La Fare, with vivacity, <Q>that if this match should take place, the apostle's saying will be reversed, and the spirit will war against the flesh.</Q> Then turning to me, he paid me a compli∣ment, with all the easy gallantry of a Frenchman, saying, that my late illness had so refined my beauty, and ren∣dered my complexion so transparently clear, that it was no wonder Mr. Williams mistook me for one of the ce∣lestial tribe. While every one was thus displaying their wit at that poor man's expence, he was, at the expence of my Dresden ruffles, endeavouring to disengage his netting pin, which in handing me to a seat, he had aukwardly entangled in them. "I used to wish," said Lady Bab, <Q>to have our beaus about town, taught a little needle-work, or netting, to keep them out of mischief; but I find Mr. Willi∣ams has such a happy nack of doing every thing, that the very thing which I proposed as a remedy, is, in his hands, the cause of—</Q> "Spare him," inter∣rupted La Fare, laughing, <Q>for if he should unfortu∣nately
<PB N="65" REF="018142_0064_0FA562D39232B4E8"/>
tear the lady's ruffles, he can perhaps do more than your Ladyship could, that is, mend them again.</Q> The entrance of Lord Ossory and my fa∣ther, put an end to this chit chat. Oh! Eliza what became of all my boasted resolutions at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of this amiable nobleman! how superior is he to the rest of his sex! how delicate, how soothing were his compliments on my recovery! He seated himself by me, he looked at me with such tender sympathy!—I must, I will console myself with the pleasing hope, that your poor Harriot is honored with some share of his esteem. It shall be my study to deserve it. My father was visibly displeased at Mr. Williams's be∣haviour. Lady Bab engrossed his whole attention with open mouth, and round unthinking face—he sat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with wonderment at all she said.—had always a laugh and a bravo at her service.—This affair goes as I could wish.—My only fear is, that when his lady mother comes (and she is daily expected) things will take a less favorable turn;—so much does the tall boy of twenty-one stand in awe of her—Of love he is utterly incapa∣ble—but he likes lady Bab, because she is so pure and merry; and, as he said the other day, he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for such a kind of wife of all things, because she would keep him laughing from morning to night.—I fear ho∣nest friend, thought I, it would be of the wrong side of the mouth, if once you have taken her for better for worse.—As to me, I am a restraint upon him:—A pret∣ty young body, he said I was (as my cousin told me) but then so plaguy grave, that he did not know what to say to me: and, indeed, when my father contrives to have us left to a <HI>tete a tete,</HI> nothing can be more ri∣diculous.—I sink into a reverie—he talks of the wea∣ther—admires my work—offers to teach me a new method of netting.—I answer at random—then begins

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Lady OSSORY to Lady BAB WILMOT.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS monstrous provoking my dear Bab, that your mother should take it into her head to be sick, at a time so unseasonable both for yourself and your friend—I could cry for vexation: your presence here is absolutely necessary.—Williams is such an ass that there is no depending on his constancy: such a passive soul, or rather body, for he has not a spark of spirit about him, that his mother, when she comes, will, with
<PB N="67" REF="018142_0066_0FA562D75FAFD8D0"/>
half a word, be able to persuade him that he never tho't you tolerable,—and that Harriot, against whom you had taken such pains to steel his heart, is an angel. For some hours after your departure, he did not know what to do with himself, and was ready, like a great boy, to blubber for the loss of his play thing; but unfortu∣nately for you, he has at last hit upon a new method of making a netting shuttle, this entirely engrosses his tho'ts—and you, poor Lady Bab, may now bind your brow with mournful willow.—He seeks only to be diverted; and, honest man, every thing has the good fortune to produce in him this effect; a wife, a monkey, a netting shuttle, or a Lord Mayor's shew, 'tis all one to Ranger.—However, I'll do what I can for you. Luckily Mrs. Williams is obliged to deny her visit; in that time I do not despair of effecting the scheme we concerted <HI>ensem∣ble.</HI>—I have only to persuade him that he is desperately in love with you.—he will stare no doubt, and perhaps be at first a little incredulous, but I shall tell him, that I see it in his eyes—that people are often affected with that disease, without being sensible of it, and that it fre∣quently proves fatal where timely remedies are not ap∣plied. I will every day pretend to discover new symp∣toms of it, both in his face and person.—In short, let me alone to work him to our purpose,—if we can but di∣vest him of the awe he has for the old lady, he will be vastly pleased with a jaunt to Scotland, it will, to use his own stile, be rare fun. How my uncle will fret—that's a trifle,—but I am vexed to death to think, that while I am laboring to promote the interest of my friend, I am at the same time compelled to do an essen∣tial service to my foe.—Yes Bab, I must ever regard my cousin as such, her conduct is a constant reproach to mine—she loves my husband, I know she loves him to distraction.—Yet censure itself cannot find the slightest
<PB N="68" REF="018142_0067_0FA562D7F436C2A0"/>
indiscretion in her behaviour,—she struggles with her passion, even to the endangering of her life; her health is visibly impaired,—she has more sensibility than me, yet can she walk steadily in the thorny path of virtue.—I cannot bear her superiority—how I shall glory in her fall—she must—she shall be humbled—strong are the temptations that are flung in her way. Ossory (whose heart and mine were never paired above, so very diffe∣rent are the form and temper of our minds) has con∣ceived for her, what the sentimental soul calls a tender friendship.—When I, as is often the case, drive him from me by my coolness or caprice, he flies to her for conso∣lation,—in the mean time I am left at liberty to enjoy the more delightful company of my dear La Fare. There's a man for ye—so lively, so elegant, so formed to please, such a compleat master of the art of love—'tis impossible to resist him.—I may say with the old Countess Marmontel, I am virtuous hitherto—by good luck. Neither of us are troubled with very squeamish consciences—we must however be cautious. La Fare is under obligations to my husband: he has too much gallantry to scruple making free with his neighbour's wife; but he would not wish to appear openly ungrateful. I wish also to wait till Ossory sets me the example. If I can but draw him into the snare I have laid for him, I shall then think myself entitled to the privilege of a mo∣dern wife: the fear of my exposing the frailty of his dul∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, will tye his tongue.—But I fear I shall never be a∣ble to wait for the last act of their snail-moving intrigue. I long for the comme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cement of mine—heartily sick of wedlock's insipid joys, I feel no more emotion at Ossory's caresses than I should from embracing his grandfather's bust. La Fare! the dear La Fare! Can alone awaken my passion, and charm my senses.—I speak freely to you Bab, you can make allowance for the weakness of

human nature—you was from the first the confident of my new passion—You have seen the dear man at my feet—You have heard his persuasive eloquence,—and you have owned, that instead of censuring our loves, you wished yourself in my place.—How I miss you.—the presence of a third person prevented all suspicion: while you was here, I had a thousand opportunities of seeing him in private; but now, how seldom does a fa∣vorable opportunity offer.—Our enchanting country rambles are no more; a <HI>tete a tete</HI> might give room for censure, and a trio was alone supportable, with my kind Wilmot.—I am become quite peevish,—that unsuffera∣ble prude, Harriot, has such a vile pair of penetrating eyes. La Fare was this morning so indiscreet, as to put my hand to his lips, while stooping at my knee to lift my handkerchief; he imagined the eyes abovemention∣ed, fixed on a piece of embroidery, the fittest place for them, but behold on glancing mine towards them, full in my face did they dart a look of mingled surprize, pity, and contempt.—Contempt! heavens!—it is not to be borne!—In revenge for this piece of impertinent watchfulness, I gave Williams the hint, Harriot▪ said I, thinks you neglect her—fye, who could expect so fine a gentleman as you are, would give room for such a re∣proach. From that moment till the evening, when Os∣sory came home and released him from the task did he pester the girl with his nonsense. When this husband of mine had paid his respects to the rest of the company, he pranced up to me, offered to salute me, and auk∣wardly tore my apron with his spur. <Q>Oh! for hea∣ven sake,</Q> cried I, pushing him from me, <Q>none of your odious pawing; the hated familiarity which ma∣trimony admits of, is a perfect antidote to love</Q>—"'Tis I madam," said he, <Q>not the familiarity, that is odious.</Q> He retired, and with a pensive air seated

I tripped to the harpsichord, &amp; began warbling, "None but fools would marry now, &amp;c." For the rest of the evening he took not the slightest no∣tice of me. He thought, honest man, to vex me, by being uncommonly assiduous to my cousin: it was the very thing I wished for, as she wholly engrossed his at∣tention. La Fare found a thousand opportunities of ex∣pressing (at least by his eyes) the ardent passion which glows in his breast. What but his dear company could induce me, a moment longer, to stay in this odious country. He

I do not dissuade you from entering into a state, which I still believe is capable of the highest happiness, tho' I, from an imprudent choice, have failed of obtaining it:—but I advise you to beware:—let my fate be a warning to you:—trust not alone a lovely face, a gentle air:—endeavour, if possible, to penetrate the thick vale of hypocrisy, with which the female heart is enveloped; most female hearts, I should say, for I have found, alas! too late, one lovely, amiable exception: but dazzled with the gaudy blaze of mere external charms, I overlooked, I was blind to the more durable, the more enchanting graces of a heavenly mind.—My wife—my torment as I fear she will prove, has thrown aside the mask, and now stands confess'd, the coquette, the modern fine lady; while her cousin every day discovers new attractions.—Fool that I was, to be caught by outward show!—What advantage do we derive from our boasted reason, when our senses so easily mis∣lead us? Happiness and misery were set before me.—Rash, infatuated fool that I was, I chose the latter.—In Harriot I have found my kindred soul—with her I should have been supremely bless'd—she is really mistress of those elegant sentiments, which the other only affect∣ed:—And, Oh, Edward! to add to my remorse, she loves: yes, in spite of all her modest, delicate caution. I have discovered the dear, flattering, dangerous secret, which she would rather die than voluntarily reveal, and which, with such virtuous resolution, she struggles to conquer.—</P>

Her health declines.—What an affecting object!—And then to know myself the cause,—can you wonder if I feel more for her than friendship alone could inspire? My wife's caprice, her mortifying indifference is insup∣portable. Short is the reign of mere external beauty; yet she might ever have held me in her chains, had she but have taken the least pains to please; if she had felt for me a mutual passion: she made me believe she did. Artful creature! A heart like her's is incapable of love. I fear she as strongly resembles her mother in her mind as in her person—that wanton libertine, who is a dis∣grace to her sex. I shall not at present tell you my reasons for this apprehension; suffice it to say, that my domestic happiness is at an end. In what gaudy vi∣sions did I indulge my imagination! how many plans of future felicity had I formed with the woman, (the angel as she then appeared) whom I adored, and a friend who I believed so worthy of my esteem! How repeat∣edly did she talk of a country life, of calm content, and rational joys!—Infatuated wretch that I was, how could I be so easily deceived? She now laughs at my folly, in supposing that she would ever submit to be buried in obscurity,—a person who is formed to attract universal admiration. She sickens at the sight of country squires; expires at the rustic conversation of their dowdy help∣mates; a murmuring stream throws her into the va∣pours; the birds deafen her with their unmeaning notes; she cannot support the fatigue of walking over my parks and gardens; yawns when I talk to her of my intended improvements; can just make shift to kill the tedious day, by playing at piquet with La Fare; enters into none of my amusements; hates reading; never touches her harpsichord in my presence, because she knows I am passionately fond of music: but I can pardon her this, since the sweet Harriot, with far more taste, supplies her

place. This amiable girl, who sees how much I suffer from her cousin's unkind, unmerited perverseness, omits no endeavours to divert my melancholy: she plays at half a word; sings to me,—and O how ravishing are her plain∣tive notes! she rides out with me, her physicians having or∣dered her to take this exercise; visits with me the groves, the pleasing shades, which I had formed for the reception of her rival; points out a thousand beauties in nature, which would otherwise have escaped my notice.—She is particularly fond of flowers—I take care that her dres∣sing room is every day supplied with the finest that mine, or the neighbouring gardens can produce—in re∣ward for my pains, she constantly wears a nosegay se∣lected from these rural presents.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. Miss RIVERS to Miss ELIZA DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>HARDLY is your Harriot delivered from one per∣secution, when another commences; and I have reason to be much more apprehensive of the last than the first.—The simple Williams was easily governed, ea∣sily persuaded to desist from his suit: but Mr. Melvill, ah! what shall I do with Mr. Melvill?—The most ac∣complished, the most amiable man, next to Lord Osso∣ry, I ever saw; approved by my father, approved even by myself. What objections can I urge?—that I love another,—a married man. I shudder at the thought. And yet is not this the case? Unhappy guilty Harriot, Guilty! no, my passion is free from every base alloy; 'tis more tender than friendly; but no less pure. My heart harbours not a wish in regard to Ossory, but what I durst avow to all the world; and yet he has such strong possession of that too susceptible heart that I cannot govern its emotions in favor of any other. I will be virtuous, that is all I can answer for. My Eliza deserves unlimited confidence—I must tell you—do not too se∣verely condemn me. Lord Ossory has discovered the secret I so carefully strove to conceal. Think not I made a voluntary confession; O, no! I should have expired with shame ere it could have found utterance. My eyes,—some little inadvertency betrayed me.</P>

We were alone the other day in the park. What a variety of emotions does the recollection excite! I was too much agitated, too much confused at the time to know the particulars of what passed; I only remember that he was at my feet; that in the plaintive voice of woe he lamented his wretched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, in having chose my cousin;—that he now too late found I alone was for∣med to make him happy; that he had mistaken admi∣ration for love; love! Which till I inspired it, was a stranger to his heart;—that heart, added he, which heaven has united to your's by the strongest sympathy and similarity of sentiment.</P>
<P>I was ready to have fainted—he started up, and sup∣ported me in his arms:—Harriot; my beloved Harri∣ot, long have I seen your virtuous struggles. O! then, cried I, disengaging myself, and hiding my face with my hands—I am compleatly wretched. I cannot, can∣not bear that you should despise me. And yet added I, with a resolute and rather haughty air,—I will, by my future conduct, put it out of your power. You know the whole extent of my weakness; it shall go no farther. I own I have not been able to behold you with indiffer∣ence; but were you a thousand times more engaging than you are; were you in the slightest manner to pre∣sume on the discovery you have made,—did you dare to offer the least indignity; from that moment I should regard you as the most despicable of your sex;—from that moment contempt would be the only sentiment you would excite.—For your own sake then, my lord, forget that you are become master of my unfortunate se∣cret, and treat me, as you have hitherto done as a friend.</P>
<P>I will treat you as the most amiable, the most virtu∣ous of women, interrupted he,—as the friend of my heart.—And here I swear, added he, putting one knee to the ground, to restrain my passion—to respect your's▪
<PB N="81" REF="018142_0078_0FA562E550623E90"/>
to be the guardian of your honor; and forgetting my∣self, to study only your peace, your happiness and fame.</P>
<P>I am satisfied cried I, giving him my hand, so high an idea do I entertain of your integrity,—so confidently do I rely on your sincerity, that all my fears are hushed to rest, and I am even pleased that we have come to this painful but salutary explanation: a load is taken off my heart: now I shall act with less restraint, depending on your promise, on your esteem: you shall assist me to conquer my weakness.</P>
<P>The appearance of my father and another gentleman, put an end to our interesting tete a tete. The stranger hastily advanced to Lord Ossory, who uttering an ex∣clamation of joyful surprize, ran to embrace him, call∣ing out, Welcome, welcome, my dear Melvill, I rejoice to see you at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grove</P>
<P>We proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed towards the house; the two friends walked on before my father and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.—He talk∣ed to me of Mr. Melvill; made me remark the grace∣ful elegance of his person. If you could make a con∣quest here, Harriot, said he, you would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have cause to triumph; he is one of the finest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in England and would, I dare say, make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excellent husband. I shuddered at the thought, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no other answer than that it was very improbable so fine a gentleman should think of an insignificant girl like me. While I spoke, Melvill looked back;—I blushed gues∣sing from that, that I was the subject of their conversa∣tion:—This blush, I fear, proceeded from vanity:—We women are very apt to construe any little notice from the other sex as marks of admiration. I had no great reason to suppose he would at that time view my person in a favorable light:—My morning dress was not calculated to shew it to advantage;—and had he thought it tolerable, my cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n's charms, adorned with
<PB N="82" REF="018142_0079_0FA562E56A022298"/>
every becoming ornament, so lately eclipsed mine, that I could not doubt but she would efface the transient impression he might have received from your Harriot. But, alass! my friend, there is no accounting for the caprice of taste: I find I am mistaken. This engaging man has already made proposals to my father, and I every moment dread a declaration of his passion. Hi∣therto I have taken care that he should not find an opportunity. Lord Ossory is become exceedingly melancholy:—he shuns me and seeks retirement:—no doubt Melvill has made him his confident.</P>
<P>My cousin rewards us all with scrutinizing eyes:—she seems displeased at the latter's assiduity to your friend:—her vanity is hurt to see any one so blind as to give me the preference. Surely she might be satisfied with La Fare, who is her slave from morning to night; too much so, I think, considering she is the wife of his friend—or any man's wife indeed.—Stop, Harriot; ah! shall you dare to censure?—Shall you attempt to pluck the more out of your neighbour's eye, who have such a beam in thine own?—O conscience! I bow, I humble myself under thy just reproof.</P>

<PB N="83" REF="018142_0080_0FA562E640EBA820"/>
in love with that vile, little provoking Harriot.—I tremble for the success of my plots—This man has a thousand attractions, besides on overgrown estate, and a title which will devolve to him on the death of an uncle. O! if the girl should be wise enough to take him, I shall expire with vexation:—all the gaieties of life will then be in her power:—but what is still worse, shall I suffer her to escape with unsullied fame? Shall she tri∣umph over me by her superior virtue?—Shall Ossory be left in possession of the insolent authority of a hus∣band?—Shall he, guiltless himself, be by that means entitled to censure every levity in my conduct?—Shall I still be obliged to wear the mask of hypocrisy, and steal me joys? His example can alone give me the li∣berty, for which my free born soul so ardently pants.—Besides, I have vowed the ruin of my cousin: so long have I indulged the pleasing hope, that I shall enjoy no rest till it is compleated. I own too, that I envy her the addresses of this Melvill; my capacious heart can∣not be satisfied with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omage of one,—I would hold all mankind in my chains. Till he came, every thing went on as I could wish.—Ossory and Harriot were perpetually together; my spies watched all their mo∣tions:—the affair was not indeed come to the crisis I ex∣pect with so much impatience, but it could not, as they went on, be long ere it did so:—but now this Melvill has put a stop to all my schemes. Ossory is seized with the vapours, and like a despairing inamarato, has shut him∣self up in his apartment, and fancies himself ill, forsooth: Harriot is also in the dumps, while her swain racks his brain to amuse her. My uncle, that he may be near to watch over the conduct of his precious daughter, plagues me with his company from morning to night. La Fare dares hardly look at me, for fear of attracting some of their vile penetrating eyes:—'tis too much—I die with

and must I be accused as the cause of all your misery?—What can I do? How shall I, how ought I to act?—I have, since deprived of your company, strictly exa∣mined my past conduct:—thanks to my guardian angel, I have nothing criminal to reproach myself with; but is this sufficient to justify me?—Ah! no; I ought not to have beheld you with partiality: ought not? alas! do I not still?—Pure as my attachment is, 'tis faulty in being placed on an improper object: firm as my reso∣lution is, to die, rather than forfeit my virtue;—yet what reliance ought I to place on the power of human reso∣lutions, when unassisted by a power superior?—And can I, while I refuse to part with the idol of my heart, expect that assistance?—No; my duty is to conquer; I wish to do so, that I may have nothing to reproach myself with—But I, blushing, own that the struggle is almost too much for my weak frame to support:—help me then, my lord;—you promised to be the guardian of my honor:—relying on this generous promise. I must again solicit your advice.—Why should we go on to indulge a hopeless love? a love which fills me with remorse. O let us endeavour to exchange it for that less tumultuous, but no less endearing sentiment, friendship.—Let us try if we cannot bring it to that. We are discouraged from attempting it, because we believe it im∣possible; but I again repeat, let us try; and that I may be the better entitled to your esteem, help me to act as becomes a dutiful daughter, a virtuous maid, and what is still more, the woman who aspires to the friendship of Lord Ossory.</P>

The duties of a wife may divert my attention; the sa∣cred engagement may keep me more steady to my lau∣dable purpose, than I could otherwise be.</P>

<P>O MY dear! the day is fixed; urged by my fa∣ther,—importuned by the most generous of
<PB N="89" REF="018142_0086_0FA562EB76FC3BA0"/>
men, for such Mr. Melvill has proved himself: with trembling emotion I gave a reluctant consent: But ere I ventured to take this important step, I thought it my duty to make the man to whom I am going to unite my destiny, acquainted with my weakness.</P>
<P>From the moment I brought myself to regard him in the light of a husband, I thought myself bound in honor to make him my unlimited confidant. Fatal is the consequence of any secret reserve, any concealment between man and wife!—With inexpressible confusion therefore I revealed to him my unfortunate, my impru∣dent attachment to Lord Ossory. He stopped me ere I had finished the painful task, and pressing me to his breast to hide my blushes,—No more, my adorable Harriot, interrupted he, you shall not be mortified by the humbling confession of an involuntary error: the manner in which you have acted, in so critical a situ∣ation, does you more honor than if you had never been tempted. Your delicate frankness to me too in this af∣fair, proves you be the noblest of your sex. I own I wished you to come to this eclaircissement; not that you have told me any thing, of which I was not before acquainted; but it would have been inconsistent with your character to have acted otherwise. Now may I, with undoubted security, deposit my honor in your hands, and place unlimited confidence in your's. Now my esteem can know no increase; for I am now con∣vinced that you as much excel the rest of your sex in virtue, as you do in every other amiable qualifica∣tion. My only regret is, that I was denied the exqui∣site pleasure of first inspiring your gentle heart with tender sensibility, because first impressions are always the most fervent and most lasting. However, give me at present all you can, my lovely girl; your esteem and friendship: it shall be my unremitted study to deserve
<PB N="90" REF="018142_0087_0FA562EC29851EB0"/>
the rest.—I offer myself to be the guardian of your ho∣nor. Hitherto you have nobly struggled in the cause of virtue, and I doubt not of your laudable perseve∣rance. But I am ambitious of sharing with you the glorious task, and O! how amply shall I be rewarded, if, by my fond assiduity, my unbounded love, I should be able, not only to banish my rival from your breast, but to have the inexpressible delight to supply his place.</P>
<P>This flattering hope induced me to solicit your hand, though I knew the mutual attachment subsisting between you and my friend; but then I also knew the worth of that friend, and a very little acquaintance with Miss Ri∣vers convinced me that she was far superior to the com∣mon run of females;—that she was a treasure, for the purchase of whom one could not pay too high a price; deign then, adorable Harriot, to bless me with your hand; but let me not owe it merely to the authority of a parent. Were the man single whom you distin∣guish with your regard, nothing should tempt me to trouble you with my addresses. No, I would honor your choice, be he who he would; that choice alone would give him merit; then would I bury my hopeless pas∣sion at the bottom of my heart:—But Lord Ossory is married.—Your father will not suffer you to remain single—I offer myself therefore, to save you from one who might be less sensible of your worth, who might love you with a less disinterested affection.—Ambitious as I am to possess your whole undivided heart; yet well I patiently wait, without murmuring, till your can complete my happiness by that invaluable gift: mean time, I will sympathize in all your tender distress, nor claim any thing as a right, but receive every little mark of your regard as a favor:—If on these terms my charming girl will consent to be mine—He paused, and fixed his sensible eyes on my face;—I cast mine down, and sighed.</P>

Besides, it hurts my delicacy to think of taking you from such selfish motives as my own security.—You deserve—Talk not of my deserving, interrupted he,—to deserve Miss Ri∣vers is the height of my ambition. While he spoke my father joined us; his authority added to the per∣suasive eloquence of this amiable man. O Eliza! I know not what I said or did, so violent were my emo∣tions; but I know now, on recollection, that I pro∣nounced the fatal Yes—that preparations are actually begun for the important occasion—and that there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but one short fortnight more between me and—happiness or misery: for in marriage there is no medium; and alas!

Alas! soon, very soon, shall we be separated, and that forever, as I propose wholly to reside at Mr. Melvill's country seat; 'tis far distant from hence, and Lord Os∣sory is too discreet to think of visiting me there.—What a weight hangs on my spirits!</P>

La Fare al∣ways La Fare, from morning to night: 'tis rather too much, Melvill and he are the only decent beings that are to be met with in this desart.—I forget Ossory, but he poor soul's a husband; no wonder I forget him; for we have separate apartments, separate views, and separate pleasures.—Never did we experience an union of hearts;—we were tacked together by mere human ties.—At which,</P>

But who can resist the eloquence of love?—Nurse always takes care to give her, ere these interviews, a dose of La Fare's curious and wonderful efficacious cordial, then sinks into her armed chair, covers her face, and is sup∣posed neither to hear or see: not that the knows the purpose for which we intend this powder;—in obedi∣ence to my orders, simply does she administer it; she takes them for sleeping draughts, because they produce that effect;—but the shrewd old dame observes, that instead of doing her lady service, they absolutely stupify her.—So much the better; if she is so inclined to sleep, it will be no great wonder if her virtue, harrasted with being so long, so continually kept on guard, should also be tempted to slumber. I have told my antient spy, that I suspect an intrigue between my husband and cou∣sin, therefore beg she will keep a sharp look out.

<PB N="96" REF="018142_0093_0FA562F4746A6560"/>
my reputation to danger?—Only one word, my Har∣riot, interrupted he,—alas! this will be the last oppor∣tunity I shall enjoy of seeing you in private—of pouring out at your feet the anguish of my heart;—a conversa∣tion which passed to day between Melvill and your fa∣ther, is my motive for once more presuming to approach my angel, in a way which she had forbid,—oh my life, my only love, added he, sinking down by her side;—pity me;—the fatal hour approaches, in which I must behold you resign yourself to my rival's arms,—again the day is fixed by an arbitrary father. He took her hand and bath'd it with tears.</P>
<P>I suspected that the drowly draught began to operate, for she either did not make any answer to what he had said, or else did it in so low a voice, that I could not hear her. The candles stood on her toilet facing the bed,—he rose, extinguished one, and placed the other at a greater distance; this deprived me of light enough to see what passed, but for a good while after my Lord continued to talk in a low plaintive tone. Need I tell you the consequence of all this? Harriot dozed, and left her virtue to shift for itself. My Lord had long struggled against a passion that now became too strong for all his resolutions;—powerful was the temptation, the passive state to which his fair one was reduced; can one wonder,—I am sure I do not. They fell; and now my long threatened revenge is accomplished.—In due time I rushed into the room, threw open the cur∣tains,—there, looked in her lover's arms, lay the sleep∣ing Harriot.—I affected to scream, and sunk, as if faint∣ing, into a chair,—Nurse hobbled to my assistance;—Ossory started from the bed; saw me, and clasping his hands, exclaimed, wretch,—dishonorable villain that I am, what have I done?—O Harriot, my love. I have ruined thee!—he threw himself with violence on the
<PB N="97" REF="018142_0094_0FA562F52B1B9560"/>
floor. Harriot awoke with the noise,—she looked wildly round, she had, I suppose, heard some part of Ossory's exclamation.—She beheld me in a rage, and him stretched at his length on the ground;—all the hor∣ror of her situation rushed to her view; she lay half raised on her elbow, one arm extended,—distraction in her countenance, she seemed converted into a statue, the statue of despair. I declare there was something so ter∣rifying in her aspect, that she absolutely made me shud∣der;—for some moments I was as little able to speak as the two delinquents; however, I soon got the better of my terror, (I believe I might call it my remorse.) Tis well my lord, cried I, at length you appear in your true colours,—now am I able to account for your indif∣ference to me,—long have I patiently borne it;—long too have I suspected this intrigue.</P>
<P>And you vile, and detestable Harriot,—what shall I say to you? thou despicable prude, who strove to con∣ceal the libertine under the mask of virtue. Do you not shudder at the presence of an injured wife? but you are hardened in iniquity; not a blush overspreads your cheek though thus shamefully detected, odious strumpet.</P>
<P>At this word Ossory started from the ground;—Strumpet! 'tis false,—cried he,—fire flashing from his eyes,—still, in comparison of thee, or almost any other of her sex, she is an angel.—Yes, one of the fallen angels, said I, disdainfully; but you, Sir, are sunk even below my contempt. 'Tis to you I speak, turn∣ing to Harriot—ungrateful wretch, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> violater of the laws of hospitality; say, dare you deny it, are you not a strumpet?</P>
<P>She was still in the posture before described; but on my thus addressing her, she with a mild and humble air bowed her head, as much as to say, alas! I plead guilty to the charge: Then casting a glance at Ossory,
<PB N="98" REF="018142_0095_0FA562F5ED17EA30"/>
she uttered a faint scream, and sunk insensible on the bed. He advanced to support her, but stopped short, and folding his arms, gazed for some moments in si∣lence on her pale face, while deep sighs heaved his bo∣som.—At last, you madam, said he, feel an ill natur∣ed pleasure, while you contemplate our distress; you have the inhumanity to triumph in that angel's fall; because, till this fatal night, she was in virtue, in merit, so much your superior. O! Harriot, continued he, in an accent that spoke the anguish of his soul, how could thy Ossory forget the respect he owed thee? How I abhor myself! Villain that I was, to take advantage of thy weakness;—ah! shall I dare to talk of thee in a stile so debasing,—of thee, whose every thought was pure and spotless as thy form: There, my Lord, cried I, that will do; I have long enough listened to your wonderously affecting complaints: Now 'tis time to proceed to business;—others have, like me, been im∣posed upon, by the specious appearance of that vile hy∣pocrite; her intended husband in particular,—be it my task to undeceive them,—her reputation shall not out∣live her virtue,—this night was doomed to put a period to both;—yes, I will have witnesses of the injury you have done me; her father, her lover, the whole world shall be acquainted with my wrongs, and her shame. So saying, I ran to the bell, but he seized hold of me, are I could reach it: Go then, said I to nurse, summon the servants—call Mr. Melvill. Stir at your peril, cried Ossory, in a voice that made the beldam tremble: I swear, added he, that if either of you dare to attempt exposing the misfortune of that dying angel, both your worthless lives shall be sacrificed to my revenge: so saying, he went and locked the door, and put the key in his pocket.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="018142_0096_0FA562F6B09F3460"/>
My courage began to fail me, terrified at the fierce wildness of his air. The man was certainly out of his senses. I condescended to sooth him; he paid not the slightest attention to what I said: Nurse was all this time busy in administering medicines to restore her la∣dy; but with as little success as I found in attempting to quiet my Lord's violent emotions: At last, how∣ever, his spirits were quite exhausted; he turned to Harriot with a mournful air, gazed a few moments in silence, then exclaimed,—yes, she is gone forever, and to me she owes her death: The last words were hardly articulate: he clasped his hands, and uttering a deep groan, down he fell, like a tragedy hero, by the side of his dulcinea.</P>
<P>I now began to be alarmed at Harriot's long insensi∣bility, and feared that La Fare's drug was not of so in∣nocent a nature as we had imagined, for death was painted on her pale countenance. I sent for him; he assured me, there was nothing dangerous in the draught; he had made physic one branch of his study. I left him therefore to take care of the two insensibles while I went in quest of Melvill; impatient to expose the frailty of his idol. I knew the generally spent an hour in his closet ere he went to rest; it was now about the time of his retiring thither, for he is as regular as a clock.—I rushed in upon him, where, after venting my well acted rage, I told him the particulars of my late mortifying discovery.

La Fare, as the nurse says, spoke of Harriot's conduct as it seemed to deserve; my Lord took fire, called him a villain, said it was time to wipe off the stain he had cast upon his honor; your intrigues, your vile ingratitude, is no secret to me; but my mind, till now, was too much engrossed by worthier objects, to find leisure to inflict on you the punishment you merit. Much more was said, as you may suppose, but nurse's memory reached no farther: She screamed with all her force; Harriot too recovered her senses, and frantic with terror, sprung from the bed, and threw herself between the combatants. At that mo∣ment Melvill fortunately made his appearance, the scene changed, deadly weapons were cast aside, the bleeding Ossory supported the fainting Harriot. Melvill, <HI>en∣desespoir,</HI> kneeled at her feet: La Fare was carried to his own apartment by my orders; no one else troubled their head about the poor Frenchman. After a proper bustle, my Lord was also carried off the stage, insensi∣ble with loss of blood. Harriot is replaced in her bed, which, it is believed, she will never quit more; death seems to have marked her for his own, in defiance of all his rivals; the expected nuptial bed, will now be exchanged for the silent tomb. Poor girl, even from me, her, till now, implacable enemy, she extorts the

pitying tear; my enmity reaches not beyond the grave, to which she is hastening. Bab, I am vapoured to the last degree,—there is no bearing this horrid house, nothing but sighs and groans are to be heard;—I'll to dear London for consolation,—the invalids have a whole college of physicians to attend them;—why then should I stay, to die of the spleen?—</P>
<P>Melvill took upon him to break the affair to my un∣cle,—I don't believe he told him one syllable of truth, for he has so much of the Roman in him, that, had he intrusted him with the secret of his daughter's fall, no∣thing I am convinced, could have screened her from his fury. I don't know how it is, but I can't find in my heart to undeceive him;—no, here I stop, sufficient has been my revenge,—if she dies, her disasterous adventure shall, for me, remain a secret.—If on the contrary (but there is little probability of that) she should recover, then indeed, I will not answer for myself, for no two charac∣ters can be more opposite, than that of your friend when low, and your friend when high spirited.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to tell you, that nurse vanished in the midst of the bustle, and has never since been heard of▪ mounted on a broom-stick, she took her flight through the air;—the truth is, at least it does not ad∣mit a doubt with me, that Melvill has got her removed to a proper distance, least she should blab. Well, ab∣solutely he is a worthy fellow; but how does he pro∣pose to stop my tongue?—there is one method by which he might effectually make me his friend.—Ah! a letter,—from I'Abbe—how has he found me out?—who has undeceived him in regard to my death?—the epistle you wrote for me to his sister, has not then pro∣duced the desired effect. I dread to open the provoking scrawl;—that wretch was born to be my torment.—Adieu, let's see what he has to say for himself.</P>

Never did I behold an object, at once so af∣fecting, and so respectable as you are at this moment, languishing on a bed of sickness, patiently without murmering, waiting for the stroke of death, unable to survive the loss of your honor. Ah! must I then lose thee my Harriot, my wish'd for bride!—Oh! dwell not on the dark side of the prospect, loath not a world which has still a thousand joys in store for you, a world, in which you may still make a distinguished and estimable figure. The arms of your Melvill are still open to receive and guard you as their most precious treasure;—few were witness to your late disaster, some of these I have effectually bribed to secrecy, the character of the rest, will render their malice impo∣tent.

my fall.—Indeed, my amiable friend, (you permit me still to call you by that endearing name) I am not the depraved wretch my conduct seems to speak me,—I abhor, I shudder at the very thought of the crime, which yet I have committed. O! why slumbered my guardian angel, when I was fatally beset by the powers of darkness!—but I perhaps was too arrogant, placed too much confidence in my virtue, therefore was per∣mitted to fall as a punishment of my pride: how effec∣tual is that punishment!—I am humbled even to the dust! the whole black transaction appears still to my terrified imagination like a frightful, dream,—I cannot distinctly remember any thing that passed. Why do I seek to recollect it? it drives me to madness;—not much longer will my heart be able to struggle with such a weight of woe;—my end approaches, I feel a gradual decline. O! my Eliza, did you but see to what a sha∣dow I am reduced—a walking ghost, how your dove∣like eyes would stream,—indeed I am a pitiable ob∣ject.—But let me for a moment forget my sufferings, to indulge a ray of pleasure, while I contemplate your goodness, your friendship:—fallen, ruin'd as I am, the virtuous Eliza would open her hospitable doors to re∣ceive me, offers to share with me that fortune which she so well me its, and will so nobly employ; even Mel∣vill's generous proposal must yield to this.—Love ren∣dered his friendship in some degree interested; but your's, my amiable girl, has no alloy.

How beautiful is the description your lively imagination has formed of that rural retreat to which you invite me?

<P>HUMBLY on my knees, do I presume to address a father, whom I revere, and whom yet I am compelled to disobey.—O! Sir, pardon and pity your unfortunate daughter! forget that you have a child; but oh! let not a parent's curse be added, to over∣whelm her with misery. I dare not reveal the cause of my flight; I have bid an eternal adieu to the world, and all its delusive joys: my separation from you, Sir, is the only thing I regret; but alas! I am no longer worthy to appear in your presence. I am now hid in an obscure retreat; and here, unknowing and unknown, will I spend my few remaining sorrowful days—You, Sir, may regard me as already dead, for never more will you behold me. Do not hate my memory; faulty as I have been, want of love, of reverence, and duty to my parent, was not amongst the number of my crimes. From others you will, I doubt not, hear that fatal story which I dare not reveal: ill-nature may ex∣aggerate, but for your sake, Sir, I wish that they would speak of me as I am, "nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice,"—then, if they take into the account, the sincerity of my repentance, I would hope that compassion would mix with your too just resent∣ment. May that portion of happiness, which seemed to await me, had I acted so as to merit it, be added to your's; and may the years which grief has cut off from my life, be, with every blessing this world can bestow, also added to those of my beloved father; for whom, while I have a being.

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Miss RIVERS to Miss ELIZA DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I Have just finished a letter to my father, and in con∣sequence of it am almost blind with weeping: grief is much more slower in its progress than I expert∣ed—How little did I think I should have so long sur∣vived the loss of my honor; but I must not be impa∣tient, heaven's will be done:—I hope my punishment will not extend beyond the grave; and surely it cannot now be many wearisome days ere I reach that peaceful asylum; till I do I have chosen one less to my taste.—The absence of my father gave me an opportunity to execute my project: long had my mind been bent on flight; not kingdoms should have bribed me to face the world, after so fatal an adventure;—neither could I have appeared in the presence of my friends, how would my eyes have fallen under their penetrating glances!—no, I seek to hide my guilt and shame, in a retreat as gloomy as my mind;—here I may weep at leisure, and brood over my sorrows, till death shall close the me∣lancholy scene. Providence has put it in my power to procure myself the necessaries of life; a wretch like me ought not to expect or ask for more. You may remember my poor faithful Nancy Hargrave, who had been my attendant from childhood: the worthy girl was a foundling brought up by the parish: my mother—O! with what tears of anguish do I lament her loss I

had I been blessed with her protection,—but I must not impiously murmur at my fate, that is adding to my sins. Let me resume my story;—My mother, I say, took the little Hargrave into her family, and gave her an edu∣cation suitable to her humble station: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>her extreme at∣tachment to me, who was then the idol of both my pa∣rents, so gained their favour, that my father, at the re∣quest of his lady, settled on her an annuity for life:—she accompanied me to the convent; I treated her more like a friend and companion than a servant.—She had for fourteen years received her annuity, and being of a frugal turn, very little of it was expended, so that the sum she had amassed was not inconsiderable; the inte∣rest alone amounted to about sixty pounds a year. At her death (you my friend was witness to my grief on that me∣lancholy occasion) she left me her little fortune as a testi∣mony of her gratitude—Ah! little did the good girl ima∣gine, that I should ever be reduced to the necessity of appropriating it to my own use;—hitherto it has been bestowed on more worthy objects;—with regret I do rob the poor of what I had dedicated to them; but who now, alas! is poorer than your unfortunate Harriot? charity must now begin at home.—Not long, I hope, shall I be obliged to borrow from my indigent pensio∣ners▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my death it will return to them again.—I did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prudent to intrust any one with the secret of my intended flight: nay, I must even from my generous Eliza, beg leave to conceal the place of my retreat.—Little did I think, when the sweet romantic situation of my present cottage, and the neighbouring village, struck me on a late excursion, that I should, in this place, end my unfortunate life.—I arrived here early this morning; very short was the conversation which passed between me and mine hostess; her hus∣band was out at his labor: he is an honest farmer,

she an industrious, modest looking woman, who is too much employed about her own affairs, to trouble her head with those of her neighbours. By letter I had prepared them for my reception.—This house is old, large and irregular:—my apartments are at a distance from those of the rest of the family, so that I may en∣joy as much of my now beloved solitude as I desire; a rosy fac'd country-girl is my only attendant, who is very attentive and obliging in her manner; she has just removed (untasted) a neat repast, which wanted only an appetite to recommend it:—ah! how should I eat, my heart dies within me, when I look round, when I reflect—O! Eliza, my dear Eliza, there is no dis∣sembling, I shall not attempt it;—never more must I behold the cheering countenances of my friends; an out cast from the world!

to be concise:—Yesterday was Sunday; tho' the doors of the great, the happy, and the virtuous, are shut against me, not so, the courts of the Most High.—To the foot-stool of his throne, the most wretched, the most heavy loaden with their sins and woes, may freely approach, and what is still more, receive a gracious wel∣come:—I went to church; so truly edifying was the sermon, that neither my eyes or thoughts were tempted to wander; my whole attention was fixed on the re∣verend, the apostolic preacher.—A storm of thunder, lightning and rain, just as divine service was over, stopp'd us at the church door: the clergyman had a passage from the vestry to his house; he passed me in going to the former, followed by a graceful looking woman, plainly, but genteely dressed:—she stopp'd when she came to me, and with a voice, the sweetness of which penetrated my heart, politely invited me to accompany her to a warmer shelter till the storm aba∣ted: I curtisied my consent:—she took a hold of my arm with a winning familiarity, and led me into a near parlour, where the good pastor was already seated in his elbow chair.—This, said my conduct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, (who I took to be his wife) is the young gentlewoman who I told you had so much disturbed my devotion:—is there not something exceedingly engaging in her countenance?—I might, my dear Eliza, have justly returned the com∣pliment; for never did I behold one so invitingly gra∣cious, as that of the amiable speaker. I cannot describe the pleasing emotions I felt, while I gazed upon her:—the hopes of her friendship was a balm to my wounded heart. She appeared to be about thirty-six;—had the remains of uncommon beauty, and an air and manner far superior to her seeming humble station. Mr. Ste∣phens asked me how long I had been in his neighbour∣hood;—I regard my young parishioners, added he, as

Death! I shudder at the bear idea of your death! interupted my new friend,—I, my child, will be a mother to you.—She stopp'd—she looked wistfully in my face—it was all bathed in tears—she clasped me in her arms with a sort of frantic air, and raising her voice, exclaimed, tell me, tell me! who you are! the likeness is so striking, the gentle accents, the winning softness is so like my Harriot! ten years ago I saw her by stealth, but durst not reveal myself even to her. She was afterwards removed; nor by the most diligent search, could I, since then, discover the place of her retreat. I would hardly breathe, lest it should interrupt my attention to what she said. How madam! cried I, ten years ago!—Harriot, do you say?—but ah! no, added I, in a more dejected tone,—it cannot be, the blessing of a mother is not reserved for the unfortunate Harriot Rivers;—mine is dead.

The last word faultered on her tongue, her eyes closed—I caught her in my arms, and for some moments we both remained insensible, locked in each others embrace.—O!

<P>YES, Eliza, I have indeed a mother, a mother who has been less guilty, but not less unfortunate than her daughter. In her sympathizing bosom. I have da∣red to pour out my grief; I have told her all my fatal story. She bathed me with her tears.—Alas! even those pure, those precious drops, cannot wipe out the stain of my dishonor; nor can her pardon, her soothing pi∣ty, or her kind maternal care, save me from the grave, to that I now make quick advances. I am almost re∣duced to a skeleton; my consumption is passed all cure; fresh air and asses milk just keep me alive, and that is all.—Well might my amiable mother be in doubt, whether or not to claim me as her daughter; nature pleaded for me in her breast, or I am so unlike the blooming, happy, innocent creature, I was ten years ago, that none but a mother could have known me.</P>
<P>Eliza, you have almost reached the last page of my sad story; one scene more, and you may close the book forever; till that arrives, the intermediate space will be a mere blank: to fill that blank, give me leave to treat you with a melancholy tale, in which my dear mother is the principal character.</P>
<P>She is of a noble family, but her fortune was small▪ nevertheless, her personal attractions were so great, that
<PB N="114" REF="018142_0111_0FA561E06D0C64F8"/>
even from a child, she was surrounded with admirers. My grand-father had a country seat near Windsor:—When my mother was about fifteen, she, for the first time, made her public appearance at a ball in that town; several of the Eaton scholars were there; amongst the rest, Lord W—'s second son, a handsome youth: he danced with her, was struck with her beauty, and from that moment became her admirer.—He was not remarkable for interior accomplishments; but he flat∣tered agreeably, and was too gay and too assiduous, not to please a young unexperienced girl, who was hardly out of her leading strings;—they parted with mutual regret;—it was not long ere they met again. At length, in a most passionate epistle, he declared his love; and having no hopes, that either of their parents would consent to the match, proposed a jaunt to Scot∣land—The lady liked him, but her attachment was far from being so indiscreetly violent as his: she answered not his letter; he wrote again:—terrified at the tho'ts of a clandestine correspondence, against which she had received so many cautions, she prudently resolved to reveal the whole affair to her mother:—She received the praises so justly merited for a conduct so laudable. Her father instantly wrote to Lord W—. The youth was sent on his travels;—a new lover soon pre∣sented himself to supply his place—a lover every way unexceptionable. My mother was not long ere she became sensible of the wide difference between Mr. Ri∣vers and Mr. W—: She now found that she had never loved the latter, and that the former was the only man who ever had, or ever could make an impression on her heart. In short, with the consent and approba∣tion of all parties, they were married, and for more than three years, nothing could equal their felicity. My father perfectly doated on his charming wife, and she
<PB N="115" REF="018142_0112_0FA561E128A6B918"/>
almost adored her husband. About ten months after their union, your unfortunate Harriot first made her appearance in this world of wretchedness.—I became the idol of both, and the more so, as for near three years after my birth, there was no prospect of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rease to their family.</P>
<P>At this time M. W—, now Lord W—, by the death of his father and elder brother, returned to England, to take possession of his new dignity: neither time nor absence had weakened his attachment to my mother: he had indeed forborne to write, not doubt∣ing but his letters would be intercepted: now, how∣ever, he flattered himself, that every obstacle was re∣moved. What then was his cruel disappointment, when the first news he heard on his return, was her marriage with Mr. Rivers! He raved, stormed, and vowed revenge for her inconstancy; nay, rash and im∣petuous by nature, he vowed she should still be his, ei∣ther by stratagem or force! The first step he took was to cause a report to be spread, in order to excite my father's jealousy, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my mother had been compelled by the arbitrary will of her parents, to give her hand to one man, while another had possession of her heart; he was named as the latter:—Ambiguous and censori∣ous hints were dropped in regard to their private meet∣ings.</P>
<P>To corroborate these reports. Lord W—, unin∣vited, made his appearance at Rivers' Park, where he behaved to my mother in a manner so daringly indis∣creet, that my father, without much ceremony, forbad him the house: he thought sit to put up with this af∣front, the better to facilitate his horrid purpose.</P>
<P>My unsuspecting mother rejoiced that they had so easily got rid of a man, whose unexpected visit had caused her much uneasiness. From that time, how∣ever,
<PB N="116" REF="018142_0113_0FA561E2143EE838"/>
a fatal alteration was visible in my father's beha∣viour; he became watchful and suspicious:—no lon∣ger did he return his lady's tender caresses; no longer was he amused with her innocent chearfulness. The most artless of women, was now regarded as the most artful. But how was his jealousy increased, when in∣formed by one of his spies, that Lord W—had ta∣ken up his abode at a farm house in the neighbourhood, and that he every night in disguise was seen, either in the park or gardens.</P>
<P>This villain of a spy, as appears from the sequel, must have been a creature of his lordship's, though my too credulous father believed him wholly devoted to his in∣terest:—to be short, this deluded husband, one morn∣ing, rose early, on pretence of going a hunting; he took leave of my mother, and said he should not be back till evening;—she, as soon as he was gone, again composed herself to rest. But ah! my dear Eliza, to what misery did she awake!—a noise she heard at the door of her apartment made her start from her peaceful slumber; it was bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed on the inside, a precaution she had never thought of, but her enemies had done it for her, and strongly did that circumstance appear to confirm her guilt. Those without, forced it open;—she with trem∣bling emotion, drew back the curtains;—by her bed∣side, she beheld the villainous plotter, Lord W—, in his shirt, as if he had just sprung from it, and a few pa∣ces from him, her husband, his sword drawn, and in∣expressible fury in his countenance. She uttered a pierc∣ing scream and fainted: her fit must have continued a considerable time, for all was silent when she recovered, and none present but two of her female attendants, al∣most distracted with despair and grief.—She arose, in spite of the remonstrances of her women, and hurrying on a few of her cloaths, ran wildly through the house,
<PB N="117" REF="018142_0114_0FA561E50C2B0550"/>
in quest of her wretched, deluded husband.—She found him in his closet, stretched at his length on the floor.—She sprung forward, and falling on her knees by his side, exclaimed, O Rivers! my life, my husband, cast me not off, I am indeed, indeed I am innocent. She ceased, and remained, with clasped hands, streaming eyes, and dishevelled hair, a silent moving suppliant. He looked up, and with a fierce air and determined accent, said, Leave me; were an angel to descend from heaven, as a voucher for your innocence, I would not believe:—go, let me never see you more; fly and hide your shame, my dishonor nothing can hide. He re∣sumed his posture, she threw herself upon him, in speechless agony;—he spurned her from him, started up, and hastily left the room.</P>
<P>For some time she lay almost deprived of sense and motion;—at length, a burst of tears came to her re∣lief: still, however, she continued on the ground, and that for several hours; at last the door opened▪ a maid entered with the rest of her cloaths; those she placed on a chair, and retired without speaking.—O! then, cried this unfortunate wife, he has indeed abandoned me! A spark of resentment was kindled in her gentle breast, at such unmerited cruelty.—This, and conscious inno∣cence, supported her spirits: She dressed herself;—the task was hardly finished, when my father, with redou∣bled rage in his countenance, again entered the room; tossed a letter to her.—there, madam, said he, judge if I can about. Go; I will not give you the satisfaction of being divorced from the man you hate; but I do not hinder you to join your infamous paramour:—Go, since you prefer the shelter of his arms, to those of a husband who adored you: go, lead a life of infamy, since it is your choice.—O! Harriot, added he, striking his breast, while his voice was hardly articulate,—how
<PB N="118" REF="018142_0115_0FA561E671DB4A58"/>
have I deserved such treatment? Why did you deceive me? or rather, why, ah! why am I not still deceived? You appeared to be the gentlest, kindest, loveliest of your sex; a pattern of every female virtue. He pulled out his handkerchief: She kneeled and clasped his knees;—Rivers, my adored husband, listen to your injured wife; let me clear my innocence; still we may be happy.—Never, never, exclaimed he, disengaging him∣self; 'tis the last struggle of my ill placed love, and now 'tis passed:—I tear you from my heart:—Go, take your cloaths, your jewels;—fly, least rage should get the better of my reason;—fly, and never let me see you more;—read that,—pointing to the letter,—and then judge, if there is a possibility of my forgiving you.</P>
<P>He left her. She dried her eyes, raised them to hea∣ven, put up a short, but fervent prayer;—it was instantly answered;—a composed sadness succeeded the transports of grief, which had lately torn her gen∣tle bosom, and she felt a degree of fortitude that seem∣ed super-natural. She took up the paper, the con∣tents of which were as follows:—</P>

She read and wept,—wept more for her deluded hus∣band, than for herself. She took leave of me, and her tears flowed with redoubled violence;—then hurried into her chaise—looked back, as Eve did when driven from Paradise,—uttered a deep sigh,—reclined her languid head on her hand, and proceeded to London: there she sold her jewels; most of them were her own before her fatal marriage, being left her by an aunt.—She found herself, after she had disposed of these, in∣cluding her bank notes, mistress of about five thousand pounds: this she placed in the funds, resolved to stint herself to the interest of it, and on no account to receive any thing further from her husband;—nay, her deter∣mination was, never more to see any of her relations or friends, but to bury herself in some obscure retreat.

She had the satisfaction to see me well, and happily ignorant of her dishonor—having indeed been made to believe, that death had, while I was an infant, robbed me of this va∣luable parent.—She settled a correspondence with my worthy companion, which was regularly continued till the good girl's death;—then she returned to her peace∣ful asylum.</P>

only for her;—and how poignant does it render my grief, when I reflect that to me she owes her ruin.—to me, who had vowed to be her protector and friend. Melvill! my worthy Melvill! where can she have con∣cealed herself? The dear, suffering, lovely wande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er! All that I have, would I give to discover the place of her retreat. I would not for worlds—for her sake, whom I value more than a thousand worlds, I would not repeat the crime that has undone her, and forever destroyed my peace: but I wish to find her, that with the soothing voice of friendship, I might calm her grief—that I might shelter her from the storms of ad∣versity. Alas! of what use is my fortune, since I am denied the privilege of relieving her want? Poor and friendless! how much may she at this moment stand in need of assistance? Why is not that delightful task reserved for her Ossory? Dear Melvill, forgive me;—you have reason to be tired of my letters,—always filled with complaints,—always engrossed by this one sad subject;—yet to you, it is almost equally interesting as to myself.</P>
<P>But let me answer the questions in your last:—first, in regard to my torment,—my wife, must I call her! She has for this week past been shut up in her apartment, having first given strict orders to be denied to all company:—Her women, I am told, are bu∣sily employed in packing up her cloaths; she in wri∣ting. I foresee an elopement: if she knew how much I wish to get rid of her, she need not take such pre∣caution to conceal her design. She means, I suppose, to follow her worthless paramour, who, the very night you took leave of us, privately left the house, though not out of danger from his wounds. With what in∣gratitude did that villain repay the benefits I had loaded him with! and what a dupe have I been to his pre∣tended friendship!</P>

I am particularly indebted to you, for so cautiously concealing from Mr. Rivers, the unfortunate share I had in his daughter's—ruin, must I call it. But for her own affecting letter to him, her flight might have ap∣peared only a step taken in order to avoid a hated mar∣riage; but in it the noble hearted sufferer hints at her dishonor; 'tis however, one great point to keep her father from a more particular knowledge of her fatal story.—Did he know the man!—ah! why am I that man!—his wounded honor would prompt him to seek revenge: my life is at his service:—There is little me∣rit in being willing to part with what is become a bur∣then; but though I would chearfully resign it, the con∣sequence might be fatal to him; and I would sooner lose a thousand lives than draw my sword against the father of my ill fated love.—Much therefore, I again repeat, am I indebted to your prudent conduct, to your watchful care, which has saved me from so distressing a dilemma. You say, that he is now eager to put his fa∣vorite scheme in execution,—I mean his retreat from the world:—misanthrophy grows upon him—one can∣not wonder at it.—I, who am so much younger, and naturally sanguine, already see life in its true colours, and consequently am sick of it: like him, I bid adieu to its empty delusions.

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. The SAME to the SAME.</HEAD>
<P>A MOST surprising event has happened, my dear Melvill,—an event, which at first threw me into a transport of joy,—but already does that begin to subside. I dare not indulge the delightful hope, that I shall be freed from my unfortunate engagement:—and if I were, of what advantage would it be, since the amiable Harriot, for whose sake alone I wish to be restored to liberty,—since she, that idol of my heart, is lost? O! that she were now here,—but let me explain this mystery.</P>
<P>Yesterday morning I was sitting in my library, which has, you know, a view of the road;—I was reading,—often have I recourse to books,—but alas! how vain are precepts of philosophy? how ineffectual
<PB N="125" REF="018142_0122_0FA561ED2B50CE60"/>
to sooth a grief like mine?—Seneca was in my hand,—but an unhappy passion wholly ingrossed both my head and heart; my eyes were fixed on the road,—I, in imagination, traced my Harriot in her flight,—every cariage that passed, seemed to be conveying that dear suffering angel from my sight.</P>
<P>In this manner was I indulging my woe, when a chaise, which drove at a furious rate, attracted my notice: there was nothing in this, which could reasona∣bly excite in me the least emotion;—and yet I found myself uncommonly agitated: it drew nearer, and at last entered my court-yard.—I started up.—O! heaven, exclaimed I—can it be her? Not a moment was I suffered to enjoy this improbable hope.—A young man, of genteel appearance, sprung from the carriage:—the arrival of this stranger excited some cu∣riosity,—I hurried to meet him;—he was at that in∣stant enquiring of the servants, in broken English, for Lady Ossory.—They answered, agreeable to her orders, that she was not at home.—I addressed him in French;—there was something in his countenance, that, in spite of the disgust La Fare's treachery had ex∣cited in me, for his countrymen, prejudiced me in his favor—He returned my civilities with great politeness.—I led him into a parlour, for he seemed excessively fatigued:—When we were seated, to my infinite sur∣prise, he said to me, You see before you, my Lord, one of the most unfortunate of men,—a man, injured by you in the most tender point. By me!—Yes, Sir▪ but that injury was unintentional: we have both been the dupes of an artful woman; a woman, whom tho' I have reason to hate and despise, my ungovernable heart still fondly doats on. In me, my Lord, behold the dishonored, the wretched husband of her, who has, for some months past, assumed the title of Lady Ossory;
<PB N="126" REF="018142_0123_0FA561EE0AE71B70"/>
a title to which she can have no claim—since, long before she saw you, she was mine by the most sacred ties: but, preferring the splendor of your rank to my humble station, she forgot her vows,—deceived me with false hopes, till she returned to England,—then, still more fatally deceived me, by spreading the report of her death. A friend of her's, wrote to my sister on this subject, pretending that she did so, in compliance with her dying request. Confined to my studies, and strictly watched by an arbitrary father, I had no oppor∣tunity of detecting this falshood. I was inconsolable for the supposed loss of a wife whom I adored:—so vio∣lent was my grief, that my life was despaired of.—I was ordered to the Spa: there I, a few weeks ago, be∣came acquainted with an English gentleman, who was also an acquaintance of your Lordship's;—you may guess the rest. The sudden death of my father obliged me to defer my journey here for some time. I am now independent; can incontestibly prove my marriage, and have therefore a right to claim my wife: of you, my Lord, I claim her. I am well informed she is in this house, though your servants have denied her:—but from you, Sir, I expect justice.</P>
<P>I am only sorry, returned I, that this wife is so little worthy of your affections:—but believe me, Sir, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to with hold her from you; on the contrary, I am ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conduct you to her apartment: I imagine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is there, though I have not seen her for some days. The character I have heard of your Lordship, said he, convinces me, that I may firmly rely on your honor: go then, Sir, do me the favor to lead me to that fallen angel, whom, infatuated with her charms, I am com∣pelled to worship.</P>
<P>I leave you, Melvill, to judge my transports on this occasion, for I will not swell my narrative with reflec∣tions
<PB N="127" REF="018142_0124_0FA561EEA6484718"/>
or comments: he followed me; but neither in her own apartment, nor in any other apartment in the house, was the fallen angel to be found. My gentle∣man began to suspect me of a design to rob him of his right; and in consequence of that thought, assumed an air, which in any other person, or on any other occa∣sion, I might have been tempted to resent; but I felt so much compassion for the poor enamoured, injured youth, that it left no room for any other sentiment. I condescended to expostulate, and dropped some hints of the treatment I had received from the woman he so eagerly sought;—hints, that one would have thought, might have damped his ardor; or at least were suffici∣ent to have convinced him, that instead of wishing to with-hold her, I should rejoice to quit all right and title to her. My assurances, however, did not satisfy him: I therefore called up my servants, every one of whom, in his presence, underwent a strict examination: they, one and all, denied any knowledge of her flight. As length, however, intimidated at my threats, or perhaps won by my promises of reward, one of her women con∣fessed, that the instant the stranger arrived, her lady, who had seen him from her window, rang for her;—that she found her almost fainting; but after taking a few drops, she hastily cried, follow me, and bring that casket with you. She then descended the back stairs, and hurrying thro' the park, reached the neighbouring village,—when pulling out her purse, she gave it to her attendant; charged her not to betray the trust reposed in her, nor on any terms to confess, that she was witness to her flight; ordered her, as soon as she conveniently could, without being suspected, to hire a chaise, and follow her to town with her cloaths; added, that she would hear of her at Lady Bab Williams's: then procu∣red a man and horse, mounted behind him, took the
<PB N="128" REF="018142_0125_0FA561F18DB5D3A0"/>
road to London, and was soon out of sight. This intel∣ligence was sufficient for the impetuous Frenchman; he staid not to ask any more questions, only wrote Lady Bab Williams, and the place of her residence in town, in his pocket-book, bowed to me and sprang into his car∣riage, ordering the man to make all possible expedition.</P>
<P>And now Melvill, what think you of this unex∣pected adventure?—I dare not freely indulge my joy: they were both under age—no consent of pa∣rents;—Sir Harry will spare neither pains nor ex∣pence to set aside this first marriage, and to establish mine.—Faint, very faint are my hopes of a release.—Her father acted most dishonorably in concealing from me her elopement from the convent. The story is too long:—I am interrupted.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Melvill; call at Williams's; I make no doubt, but she would fly to her friend Bab for shelter. I am exceedingly anxious to know what will be the issue of this affair.</P>
<P>Your account of Mr Rivers, gave a deep impres∣sion to my peace:—you, I suppose, are intrusted with the knowledge of his retreat. May that retreat afford him the tranquility, which he has in vain sought for in the world;—Once more adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. Lord OSSORY to Mr. MELVILL.</HEAD>
<P>THE inclosed letters made me shudder! What a scene of horror do they disclose!</P>
<P>In compassion to the ill-fated Aubigny, I instantly set off for Barnet, that I might, if possible, save him from the consequences of his rashness.—I would not wish to screen a criminal from justice: But the circum∣stances of this melancholy affair, the provocation he had received, greatly extenuated his guilt, and rendered
<PB N="132" REF="018142_0129_0FA561F405289650"/>
him an object of pity. Alas! my pity came too late; ere I arrived he had finished his part, the tragedy was at an end. I was led to the apartment: the first ob∣ject that struck me, was the body of La Fare; be his crimes forgot, they ought not to outlive their punish∣ment. I heard a deep sigh, and passed on to the bed,—there, in the last agonies of death, lay the wretched Isabella, the fair cause of all this mischief: she was close∣ly pressed in the arms of her unfortunate husband,—his eyes were closed, and he was totally deprived of sense and motion;—yet, so firmly did he clasp her, that the nurse, who wanted to raise her a little, could not disengage her from him.—'Twas no matter, she was too far gone, nothing could save her life.—I guessed by the expression of her countenance, that she knew me, but she could not speak;—all she could do, was to turn her languid eyes towards Aubigny;—a tear dropp'd on his pale face;—she then raised them to me (now deprived of all their lustre) with a mournful supplicating look, as if to solicit my assistance for him: a deep groan followed that moving glance, which pier∣ced my heart, and will never be effaced from my me∣mory:—that glance was her last,—a second groan released her struggling soul from its narrow prison; and her once brilliant eyes were closed forever.</P>
<P>Our whole attention was now engrossed by Au∣bigny.—With great difficulty we unfastened his clasp∣ing hands, a surgeon bled him, a few drops only issu∣ed; but his pulse ceased to beat, all remedies were fruitless;—he no longer stood in need of our assist∣ance.</P>
<P>What we had mistaken for a swoon, was death:—grief and despair had broke his tender heart.—I have seen them decently, though very privately in∣terred;—one grave contains the ill-fated pair.—La Fare,
<PB N="133" REF="018142_0130_0FA561F4C8538010"/>
out of respect to the memory of Aubigny. I ordered to be placed at the opposite side of the church:—in death, at least, his Isabella shall be all his own.—Peace be to their ashes—She who in life, out-shone the fairest of the fair;—she who so late, triumphant in her charms, her rank and riches now lies low, her dust mixes with beggars, and not a stone marks out her humble grave.</P>
<L>Favor is deceitful,</L>
<L>And beauty is vain:</L>

<P>Adieu, my dear Melvill: the prospect of happiness, which now opens to my view, would be too much for me to support, were it not for the melancholy scenes in which I have been engaged.—I could wish how∣ever, that my joy had received a more moderate alloy.—To-morrow morning I shall proceed to London.—The rapturous subject nearest my heart, I defer till meeting: I shall then write to Mr. Rivers; he will, I hope, accompany us to the retreat of my love. I am now convinced that my Harriot and I were destined for each other. But ah! how fatal were the events, by which our union was to be accomplished.</P>
<P>Why hangs this weight upon my heart?—'Tis true, I cannot yet call her mine,—but what now is there to prevent her being so?—every obstacle is re∣moved—O! I will not admit a doubt of my approach∣ing felicity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. Miss RIVERS to Miss ELIZA DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>GRIEF was slow in its operations;—joy was forced to come to its assistance, and now indeed the blow is struck;—the transport was too violent: to find myself in a great measure cleared from a crime, which hung so heavy on my heart;—to be clasped in the arms of a reconciled father; to behold at my feet the amia∣ble man, who I have long so fondly loved; to be at last permitted to indulge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> without a crime;—the joy was too exqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;—human nature could not support it,—but I am satisfied. One moment of my life I have tasted happiness without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and now I shall die in peace. Adieu, my true, my worthy friend. Death only could dissolve that sweet sympathetic friend∣ship, which commenced almost from infancy, and has ever since encreased. Adieu!—a long adieu!—This is, I fear, the last assurance you will receive of your Harriot's love. Will you not come and close my eyes, and shed a gentle tear over the poor remains of your affectionate,</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Mr. Melvill is here. I have obtained his promise to write to you when I have breathed my last. I would wish you to know how I acquitted myself in that try∣ing moment, when the divine grace can alone support us: that grace I most fervently implore; already do I feel its efficacy; all within is at peace.—Farewel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. Mr. MELVILL to Miss DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the request of your angel friend, (every request of her's was a law to her Melvill) I intended to have given you a minute account.</P>
<P>I cannot,—my full heart swells to my eyes.—I do not blush to own my sensibility;—I have wept—I still weep—a Stoic would have been softened at the mournful scene, to which I was a sad witness—Poor Ossory!—that relief is denied him: to fall from such a height of happiness!—Need I tell you that the lovely Harriot is no more? this I might tell you; but to describe our grief, is not in the power of language!—she alone was calm and piously resigned.—O! how beautiful did she look!—her form seemed more than human,—while with placid sweetness she strove to console us,—while she kissed off a mother's tears, and besought a fa∣ther's blessing;—but when she turned to the despair∣ing Ossory,—sighs stopped the passage of her soothing voice;—she grasped his hand,—she raised her eyes to heaven;—heaven only could support her in so severe a trial.</P>
<P>Why do I attempt it?—No human pen is equal to the task.</P>
<P>He was forcibly dragged from the lifeless body. The first transports of his grief were terrible:—this morn∣ning I left him for a moment to the care of his servant, while I went to feed my woe by paying a visit to the chamber of mourning;—there dressed in the pale habi∣liments of the dead, lay the now literally angel Har∣riot,</P>
<L><PB N="136" REF="018142_0133_0FA561FA226851B0"/>
Strew'd with flowers;</L>
<L>Herself the fairest flower;</L>
<L>A drooping lily, wither'd in its prime.</L>
<P>I took my seat by her bed: I had not sat long, when in rushed my unfortunate friend. The curtains on his side were closed; he threw them open, fixed his eyes on the corpse, clasped his hands, and stood fix∣ed in silent grief, the statue of despair;—not a tear flowed—not a sigh heaved his bosom: at last his colour changed, his eyes closed, and he fell to the ground in a deep swoon. We have restored him to some degree of life; he breathes, and that is all. I beg leave to subscribe myself, with great esteem,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. Mr. RIVERS to Mr. MELVILL.</HEAD>
<P>HOW is your unhappy friend, my dear Melvill? Has the exercise of travelling and change of scenes, in any measure produced the wished effect? Is he yet recovered from that alarming stupefaction, in which I saw him depart—when he appeared a mere machine, moved at our pleasure? Continue, most va∣luable and amiable young man, your generous care of him. There are few instances of a friendship like your's, and yet in Mr. Melvill it seems nothing extraordinary. So much as the whole te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or of his life prepared us for noble and disinterested actions. Never woman could boast the conquest of two more exalted, more worthy
<PB N="137" REF="018142_0134_0FA561FC817B74A0"/>
hearts, than my poor ill-fated Harriot. In this life we must not hope for unmixed felicity. Had my love∣ly girl been spared, mine would have been perfect, and I should have descended to my grave in peace: she alone is wanting to fill up the measure of my hap∣piness; but let me be thankful for the inestimable blessings that are still left me,—a wife, whom I have ever loved, at length restored to me—pure and unsullied; all my injurious suspicions removed; the strongest, the most convincing testimonies of her inno∣cence produced: that villain Lord W—, on his death-bed, confessed to Mr. Stephens, who he purpose∣ly sent for, the accursed arts he had used to excite my jealousy; he expected a divorce would have followed, and that he should by that means become master of that amiable wife, of whom my rash credulity had ren∣dered me so unworthy. This best of women conde∣scends to be reconciled to me; she has not uttered one single reproach; with pious charity she forgives my past cruelty: she is now, if possible, more dear to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond heart than when I first received her to my arms, in all the blooming pride of youthful beauty. What a salu∣tary effect has her example, and the conversation of the worthy Stephens, produced in me? Long have I stu∣died philosophy, and from its specious precepts hoped for peace. Vain hope! Fruitless remedy for the ills of life; "their force alone religion can disarm."</P>
<P>Here then I fix, and here only can I find a firm an∣chor for my soul.</P>
<P>My wife, whose will shall now be a law to me, is fond of this retreat. I have as little inclination as her to launch again into a tumultuous world: I have, therefore, in compliance with her request, purchased a commodious, pleasantly situated house, which is not a
<PB N="138" REF="018142_0135_0FA561FDF0BC9000"/>
quarter of a mile from our present habitation. We cannot prevail on Mr. Stephens to live with us: no∣thing, he says, could bribe him to quit his humble cot∣tage, wherein he has passed so many years of content∣ment and tranquility. He will, however, be frequent∣ly our welcome guest. A more youthful one, but one no less worthy, is come to console, to wipe off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears of a disconsolate mother, and to supply to her the loss of a dear lamented daughter; the person I mean is the amiable Miss Dudley, the friend and confi∣dant of my departed Harriot; she is independent mis∣tress of a large fortune; is naturally of a grave turn; her gentle heart is formed for friendship, but seems averse to attachments of a more tender nature: the late melancholy event has added to her pensive cast of mind.</P>
<P>She had let off to pay her Harriot a visit ere she re∣ceived your letter: long before would she have given that proof of her regard, but that her friend refused till our arrival here, to reveal to her the place of her re∣treat. The moment she was informed of it, she set off, and travelled post; greatly was she fatigued;—when I handed her from her chaise, she was obliged to sup∣port herself on my arm;—yet with all her friendly haste she came too late to receive her Harriot's last adieu. She fainted on being told the fatal news;—when recovered, she gave me her hand,—Lead me to her Sir,—bursting into a flood of tears she exclaimed in broken accent,—Yes, Harriot! my sister, my friend, I will close thine eyes.—My child had just been placed in her coffin;—the serene smile of innocence rendered her lovely even in death.—The moment we entered the room, Miss Dudley hastily quitted my arm, and rushed forward; she wrung her hands in an agony of grief, while her streaming eyes were fixed on her friend?—
<PB N="139" REF="018142_0136_0FA561FE6B6EFCF0"/>
at length, uttering a deep sigh, she threw her arms round the coffin, and laid her cheek close to her's;—sobs choaked the passage of her voice; at last,—Not one tear only, my Harriot, raising her head,—O, no! my eyes shall never cease to flow!—in retirement will I bury myself, till thy grave receives me. You will not deny your Eliza a place by your side?—there will I join thee, my sweet companion,—my friend,—how benign is the air of that pale face!—so have I seen thee look, when listening to a tale of woe;—the tears with which I have bedewed thee, seem thine own.—Such were the gentle drops that pity has often caused to flow;—but where is that dimpled smile of innocent vivacity, with which you used to enliven our little parties?—Alas! long, long has mirth been a stranger to my Har∣riot's breast,—and now it is for ever banished from that of thy friend. Thy voice is stopped, my love; but I know what would have been thy last request, Comfort my mother,—supply my place. Yes, Harriot, that late-found amiable mother shall be mine;—we will mix our tears, and talk of thee for ever. And now farewel, farewel my angel friend,—daily will I visit thy grave.—not a weed shall be suffered to grow near thee; thou withered rose, untimely cropped by the rude hand of death. One kiss more. While she spoke, my discon∣solate wife entered the room; there is a solemn dignity in her grief, that is not to be dissembled.—Eliza rushed into her arms, and sobbing, exclaimed,—O Madam, let me, let me be your child; I am an orphan,—receive to your protection the friend of your Harriot.</P>
<P>Such scenes as these lose by the recital; to feel their force you should have been present; but I cannot wish you had at this; it was too affecting.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="018142_0137_0FA561FF6858B088"/>
Let us, my dear Melvill, fly to the sacred volume of inspiration for consolation,—there we shall find that so∣vereign balm which</P>
<L>Can clear the cloudy front of wrinkled care,</L>
<L>And dry the tearful sluices of despair.</L>
<P><Q>It is not just we should be without sense and feel∣ing of grief, in the afflictions and sad accidents that befal us, as if we were angels that have no sense of nature; neither is it just that we should be quite de∣jected, like heathens that have no sense of grace;—but 'tis just that we should be afflicted and com∣forted like christians.—<BIBL><HI>Pascall's Thoughts.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Melvill, success attend your friendly expedition. Believe me with the most perfect esteem,</P>
