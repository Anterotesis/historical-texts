<HEAD>The Zealous Christian.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Joh. II. 17.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The Zeal of thy House hath Eaten me up.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are at this time concerned with a people professing a <HI>Zeal for the House of God</HI> that has <HI>Eaten up</HI> a Little part of their Estates, which they have devoted unto the Building of the <HI>House,</HI> wherein We are now Assembled be∣fore Him. Our concern with them, is not only to assure them, that what the <HI>Zeal</HI> has <HI>Eaten up,</HI> will not be Lost, but also to remind them of o∣ther and further Operations, where∣in their <HI>Zeal</HI> is to be demonstrated: That so their <HI>Zeal for the House of
<PB N="4" REF="001913_0004_0FB9D5EBD5146878"/>
God,</HI> may be uniform, and be univer∣sal, &amp; be justified. <HI>Hearken, my Be∣loved Brethren.</HI> I do now some∣thing more than fetch a <HI>Red hot Stone</HI> from the <HI>Altar,</HI> for this pur∣pose, to keep alive the <HI>Flame</HI> of your <HI>Zeal:</HI> I bring the pattern of our admirable SAVIOUR, Even, <HI>our God, who is a consuming Fire.</HI> When the Psalmist, who is Renowned in all Ages for the <HI>Zeal of the House of God,</HI> which was flaming in him, gave this Account of himself, <HI>The Zeal of thy House hath Eaten me up,</HI> we may say, <HI>I pray thee, of whom spake the Psalmist this? Of himself, or of some other Man?</HI> The Answer must be, He was a Type of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> in what he <HI>Spake.</HI> It was foretold of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> That <HI>the Lord should come into His Temple, and act as a Refiner there.</HI> Our SA∣VIOUR coming into the <HI>Temple,</HI> and purging the <HI>Temple</HI> of the <HI>Mo∣ney-changers</HI> there, would have drawn the minds of the People unto the
<PB N="5" REF="001913_0005_0FB9D5EE1C7FFD70"/>
Consideration of that famous Pro∣phecy. Whether it had this Effect or no, the minds of His Disciples, were drawn to consider <HI>another</HI> Pro∣phecy; and what was to be found in the <HI>Sixty ninth Psalm</HI> concerning Him. Every <HI>Israelite</HI> was to pay <HI>half a Shekel</HI> yearly to the service of the <HI>Temple.</HI> When any Man brought a <HI>Shekel,</HI> to change for Two <HI>Half-Shekels,</HI> there was a <HI>profit</HI> Exacted by the <HI>changer:</HI> And when the <HI>Shekel</HI> was brought for Two, there was a <HI>Double</HI> profit Exacted for the change. The like <HI>unlawful gains</HI> were made by selling of Cattle for the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> there. Our SAVIOUR having His Holy Soul, inflamed with a just <HI>Zeal,</HI> against the <HI>Dishonesties</HI> and <HI>Oppressi∣ons</HI> committed by these <HI>Ecclesiastical Harpies,</HI> appears with a <HI>Scourge</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> small Cords in His Hand, threatning of them, and the guilty Thieves fled before Him: GOD in our SAVI∣OUR Struck them with such a dread, that they could not stand be∣fore Him.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001913_0006_0FB9D5F02EBFD1B8"/>
The <HI>Zeal</HI> which our SAVIOUR Exerted on this Occasion, made His Disciples, to remember the Descripti∣on which the Holy SPIRIT had a∣bove a Thousand years before given of Him; in this passage, <HI>The Zeal of thy House hath Eaten me up.</HI> I hope you observe, That they who atten∣tively Read the Word of God, will have the advantage from it; A Profitable and a Comfortable <HI>Re∣membrance</HI> of what they have Read. Agreeable passages of what they have Read, will be Occasionally <HI>Remembred</HI> with them. You also observe; That all the Characters of the promised REDEEMER, given in the <HI>Ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> are answered in our Bles∣sed JESUS. Nothing was Prophesi∣ed concerning the REDEEMER to come, which we don't find answered in our Lovely JESUS.</P>
<P>But the principal Thing to be now observed is this.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001913_0007_0FB9D5F570168FE8"/>
The Zeal of the House of GOD, will mightily possess them, who have an Heart after the Heart of GOD.</P>
<P>A <HI>David,</HI> who was a <HI>Man after the Heart of GOD,</HI> was one that could say, <HI>The Zeal of thy House hath Eaten me up.</HI> The Antitype of <HI>David,</HI> and the Man who was GOD as well as Man, and had an <HI>Heart</HI> the most <HI>after the Heart of GOD,</HI> that ever was in the World, could much more say, <HI>The Zeal of thy House ha's Eaten me up.</HI> Such a <HI>Zeal</HI> must be in every One, who would have his <HI>Heart</HI> found <HI>after the Heart of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire, first. What is meant by <HI>Zeal</HI> in General?</P>
<P>To this the Answer is; That <HI>Zeal</HI> is an Affection to the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of God in an <HI>Intense De∣gree. Zelus est Intensus Gradus affecti∣onis.</HI> Every Good Man has his <HI>Af∣fections,</HI> towards God and the Things that please Him. Now, as the
<PB N="8" REF="001913_0008_0FB9D5F779B22058"/>
Word <HI>ZELE,</HI> comes from a Theme, that Signifies, <HI>To be Boiling hot;</HI> So, When our well-placed <HI>Affections,</HI> are <HI>Boiling Hot,</HI> or, when we are, what we read, Rom. XI. 11. <HI>Fer∣vent in Spirit, Serving the Lord,</HI> then have we a <HI>Zeal of GOD.</HI> In <HI>Zeal,</HI> there is first, a <HI>Love</HI> to GOD: and a very Intense <HI>Love,</HI> But then this <HI>Love</HI> must operate in a <HI>Sorrow</HI> for, and an <HI>Anger</HI> at what is displeasing to GOD; An <HI>Indignation</HI> against Every Thing, that is a <HI>Provocation</HI> to GOD. <HI>Zeal</HI> is a Composition of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Grief,</HI> and <HI>Wrath:</HI> an Holy mixture of all these passions, belongs unto it.</P>
<P>We will Enquire; Secondly, What is meant, by being <HI>Eaten up</HI> with <HI>Zeal?</HI></P>
<P>To this the Answer is; Besure it intends, that the <HI>Zeal</HI> does <HI>mightily possess</HI> them in whom it is. Then does the <HI>Zeal</HI> of a Man <HI>Eat him up,</HI> when it makes an <HI>Entire oblation</HI> of his All unto GOD. The <HI>Fire</HI> did
<PB N="9" REF="001913_0009_0FB9D5F88B6C3D78"/>
<HI>Eat up,</HI> what was upon the <HI>Altar.</HI> An Holy Man, does that thing, Rom. XII. 1. <HI>Present your selves unto GOD.</HI> He laies his <HI>All</HI> as on the <HI>Altar</HI> before the Lord, and <HI>Zeal</HI> comes like a <HI>Fire,</HI> so to consume it all, that GOD only shall have the <HI>Re∣gards</HI> of all, the <HI>Uses</HI> of all. The <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of GOD, must Engross all our <HI>Faculties;</HI> must em∣ploy all our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> all our <HI>Time,</HI> all our <HI>Strength.</HI> We are to <HI>Love the Lord our God with all our Heart;</HI> And the Interests of GOD must <HI>Swallow up</HI> all our Interests. Then the <HI>Zeal of GOD</HI> has <HI>Eaten us up.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Our Main Enquiry is, <HI>What is the Zeal of the HOUSE of GOD, which is mightily to possess us!</HI> or, How are we to demonstrate our selves <HI>mightily possessed,</HI> with the ZEAL of the HOUSE of GOD? You shall have the Answer to this, in these Articles.</P>
<P>I. We are to be <HI>Zealously Concerned,</HI> that we may Enjoy the <HI>Church</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="001913_0010_0FB9D5FBA123A868"/>
our SAVIOUR, and have the Enjoy∣ment of all the <HI>Ordinances,</HI> which are in the Church administred unto them who wait upon Him. What is the <HI>House</HI> of GOD? We are told; 1 Tim. III. 15. <HI>The House of GOD is the Church of the Living GOD.</HI> There must be awakened in us a <HI>Zealous Con∣cern,</HI> to have the <HI>Church-State</HI> of the Gospel, Erected, Preserved, Suppor∣ted among us. The <HI>Zeal of the House of GOD</HI> is defective in us, if we delay to come into the <HI>Church-State</HI> of the Gospel, and to join unto the Societies that associate for the Worship of GOD our SAVIOUR. That such a <HI>Church-State</HI> may be car∣ried on, we should be willing to lay out what should be Necessary. It must be <HI>nourished</HI> with what we have: Else we cannot say, That the <HI>Zeal</HI> of it has <HI>Eaten us up.</HI> A Servant of GOD, was at much Expence, that so the Worship of GOD, might be maintained. It was He, who said, <HI>The Zeal of thy House hath Eaten me
<PB N="11" REF="001913_0011_0FB9D5FDD6C42BB8"/>
up.</HI> And for this cause he also said, 1 Chron. XXIX. 3. <HI>I have set my Affection to the House of my GOD.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, His <HI>Ordi∣nances</HI> are dispensed. The <HI>Zeal</HI> of that <HI>House</HI> must make us prize our <HI>Opportunities</HI> to be partakers of these <HI>Ordinances.</HI> We must be <HI>Glad,</HI> when we have <HI>Opportunities</HI> to draw near unto GOD in His <HI>House;</HI> and at∣tend upon the Exercises wherein GOD is to be there met withal. This was the <HI>Zeal</HI> of old so Express'd; Psal. CXXII. 1. <HI>I was glad, when they said unto me, Let us go into the House of the Lord.</HI> We must be <HI>Sad,</HI> when we are depriv'd of, debarr'd from, <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to meet with GOD in His <HI>House,</HI> and there have <HI>our Fel∣lowship with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.</HI> So was the <HI>Zeal</HI> Express'd of Old; Psal. CXLII. 4. <HI>When I remember these things, I pour out my Soul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the House of GOD.</HI> Such ought our
<PB N="12" REF="001913_0012_0FB9D6016EDF2D10"/>
<HI>Zeal</HI> to be for the <HI>House of</HI> GOD, that we should think much of <HI>no pains</HI> to come unto it. We should have such a Value for what is to be done, and heard, and had in the <HI>Assemblies</HI> of the Faithful, that we should begrutch no Labour, no Travel, for coming at them. A small matter should not be made our Excuse for not Coming at them. We should esteem an <HI>Hour</HI> there, to be <HI>better than a thousand elsewhere.</HI> Our Esteem for what is to be found there, should <HI>overcome</HI> all the <HI>Diffi∣culties</HI> of Coming thither. Then does the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> indeed <HI>Eat us up,</HI> when no Difficulties in the Way can stand before it. The <HI>Zeal of the House of GOD,</HI> will Ena∣ble a Man to say with him, Psal. XXVI. 8. <HI>I have Loved the Habitati∣on of thy House.</HI> It will make a man Delight in such Devotions as are performed at the <HI>House</HI> of GOD. It will give him a Delight in <HI>praying</HI> to GOD, in <HI>Hearing</HI> from GOD, in
<PB N="13" REF="001913_0013_0FB9D603478D1B00"/>
<HI>Praising</HI> of GOD, in sitting at the <HI>Holy Table,</HI> and in observing all that our Lord has required there. And a <HI>Zeal for the House</HI> of GOD, will be accompanied with a <HI>Zeal for the Day</HI> of GOD: The <HI>Lords▪ Day,</HI> which is a Day Principally set apart for these Devotions. 'Tis a welcome Day to a Man, who has the <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> of GOD <HI>Eating</HI> him up. The <HI>Sab∣bath</HI> is a Delight unto him. When the <HI>Ordinances</HI> in the <HI>House</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are more to us, than our <HI>Necessary Food,</HI> and our Souls feed up∣on them, then the Zeal of His House hath <HI>Eaten us up.</HI></P>
<P>II. We should be <HI>Zealously Con∣cerned,</HI> that the <HI>Church</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR may be purified from all <HI>Cor∣ruptions,</HI> and nothing that will <HI>Corrupt Religion</HI> may be remaining there. When was it, that our Saviour said, <HI>The Zeal of thy House hath Eaten me up:</HI> It was when He was chasing out of the <HI>Temple,</HI> the Corruptions which had crept into it. There is
<PB N="14" REF="001913_0014_0FB9D605F09A3320"/>
now in the Minds of Men, a Natural Tendency to <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Folly.</HI> The <HI>Spirit which works in the Children of Disobedience,</HI> improves the Tendency with a Cursed <HI>Efficacy.</HI> Hence it comes to pass, that Things Abomi∣nable to the Holy GOD, Speedily and Easily get into His <HI>House:</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> of GOD can't continue long undefiled; but <HI>Roots of Bitterness</HI> are continually springing up in it, where∣by <HI>many are defiled.</HI> Now, we must have in us a <HI>Zealous Concern,</HI> to see the Church rescued from the <HI>Abo∣minations</HI> which the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> or the <HI>Sin of Man, </HI> has introduced into it. The <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> of GOD, is very notably to be employ'd on that work; Dan. VIII. 14. <HI>The Sanctuary shall be cleansed. Zealous Reformers</HI> are they that have the <HI>Zeal of the House of GOD</HI> acting of them.</P>
<P>We must have a <HI>Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Re∣formation</HI> of Abuses that are got into the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD, and prosecute the <HI>Reformation</HI> with a <HI>Vigour</HI> in our
<PB N="15" REF="001913_0015_0FB9D60C0F6F4F28"/>
Application to it; with a <HI>Venture</HI> of our All for the Accomplishment of it. When the <HI>Zeal of the House of GOD,</HI> was burning in the Soul of <HI>Elijah,</HI> he could say, 1 Kings XIX. 10. <HI>I have been very Jealous for the Lord of Hosts; for the Children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant, and thrown down thine Altars.</HI> The <HI>Zeal of the House of</HI> GOD must make us Industrious to restore and preserve <HI>Sound Doctrine</HI> there. We must Vin∣dicate the <HI>Truth,</HI> and Suppress <HI>Here∣sies</HI> by using all proper Methods of Conviction upon them. Our Zeal is thus called for; Jude 3. <HI>Earnestly contend for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. Gospel Truths</HI> must be precious to us. We are to <HI>buy the Truth</HI> at any rate, but <HI>sell it</HI> at no rate in the World. We are to be <HI>Valiant for the Truth upon Earth;</HI> And strive to an Agony rather than part with it, and spend All in the Defence of it, and suffer any Death rather than <HI>Deny</HI> it. The <HI>Liberties</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001913_0016_0FB9D612126463A8"/>
of the <HI>Church</HI> are to be livelily de∣clared for, livelily adher'd to. We are to <HI>Stand fast</HI> in them. If any make unjust Invasions on them, we are to withstand the <HI>Invaders.</HI> The <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> of GOD must make us do our part, that the <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD may be there managed, only according to the <HI>Divine Appointments,</HI> and not be polluted with <HI>Humane In∣ventions.</HI> Our <HI>Zeal</HI> must Signalize our Dislike of that Iniquity; Mat. XV. 9. <HI>In vain do they Worship me, teaching the Commandments of Men.</HI> We are to be for <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Worship;</HI> and go as far as we can, and under∣go any thing rather than have our Conscience polluted with any <HI>False Worship</HI> whatsoever. The <HI>Zeal</HI> of the Great GOD Himself is peculiarly display'd, in the matters of the <HI>Se∣cond Commandment.</HI> And our <HI>Zeal</HI> must make us thoughtful, that the <HI>Images</HI> may not be brought unto the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, which may Violate His <HI>Holy Commandment</HI> there. Once
<PB N="17" REF="001913_0017_0FB9D615D79C9DE0"/>
more: The <HI>Zeal of the House of</HI> GOD must make us do our part that no <HI>Ill-manners</HI> may be prevailing and Indulged there; and that there may not be room for that complaint, <HI>A∣mong my People there are found Wicked Men.</HI> Our <HI>Zeal</HI> must be like that in <HI>Ephesus;</HI> Rev. II. 2. <HI>Thou canst not bear with them that are Evil.</HI> We must be for keeping up a <HI>Godly Dis∣cipline;</HI> a <HI>Discipline</HI> that shall be a <HI>Terror to Evil Doers,</HI> and a <HI>Praise to them who do well;</HI> a <HI>Discipline,</HI> that shall <HI>put away a wicked person from a∣mong us.</HI> With <HI>Zeal</HI> we are to re∣buke Offenders; with <HI>Zeal</HI> to cen∣sure miscarriages; and countenance nothing that is punishable; not suf∣fer it, that the <HI>House of</HI> GOD be a <HI>Den of Thieves.</HI> When we are vehe∣mently carried this way, then the <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> of GOD has <HI>Eaten us up.</HI></P>
<P>III. We should be <HI>Zealously con∣cerned,</HI> That we may obtain the <HI>Bles∣sings,</HI> which in the <HI>House of</HI> DOD,
<PB N="18" REF="001913_0018_0FB9D61993A63660"/>
we have a Tender of: Have a <HI>Strong Appetite,</HI> for what is going in the <HI>House.</HI> In the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, and in the <HI>Assemblies of Zion,</HI> there is an admirable variety of <HI>Blessings,</HI> wherewith GOD will be the <HI>Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him</HI> there. One who was eminent for his Res∣pects to the <HI>House of</HI> GOD, could say; Psal. V. 5. <HI>I will come into thy House in the multitude of thy Mercy.</HI> There is a <HI>multitude</HI> of Blessings, a great Number of no small Blessings, for which we are to come into the <HI>House</HI> of GOD. Here we are <HI>Ad∣vised</HI> of the <HI>Blessings;</HI> Here we are <HI>Enriched</HI> with the <HI>Blessings;</HI> Here we are <HI>Directed,</HI> and here <HI>Assisted,</HI> for our Arriving to the <HI>Blessings.</HI> We are to be <HI>Zealously concerned</HI> for a share in these <HI>Blessings:</HI> And our <HI>Zeal</HI> must be such, that nothing shall sa∣tisfy us without the <HI>Blessings.</HI> Then, the <HI>Zeal of the House of</HI> GOD has <HI>Eaten us up!</HI> Our Business at the House of GOD, must be for a sweet
<PB N="19" REF="001913_0019_0FB9D61AF42B83B8"/>
Experiment of that Word; Lam. III. 25. <HI>The Lord is Good unto them that wait for Him, unto the Soul that seeks Him.</HI> There are the <HI>Blessings</HI> which the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> does mainly Consist of, and Insist on; The <HI>Blessings</HI> of <HI>Transgression forgiven, and Sin covered;</HI> The <HI>Blessings</HI> of a <HI>Turn from all Iniquities;</HI> The <HI>Blessings,</HI> which we are <HI>Indeed Blessed</HI> of GOD, when we have them Secured unto us. Our <HI>Zeal,</HI> and an Insatiable <HI>Hunger</HI> for the <HI>Blessings,</HI> must carry us to the <HI>House of</HI> GOD; Else the <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> has not <HI>Eaten us up.</HI> In coming to the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, we are <HI>zealously</HI> to Propound and Expect, the Assuring of such <HI>Blessings</HI> unto us. When our GOD calls us to His <HI>House,</HI> it is for this <HI>purpose;</HI> Isa LV. 3. <HI>Come unto me; Hear and your Souls shall Live; and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure Mercies of the Be∣loved One.</HI> The <HI>Blessings</HI> to be ac∣quired in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, are
<PB N="20" REF="001913_0020_0FB9D61EB889ADB8"/>
those <HI>Blessings;</HI> the <HI>Merchandise whereof, is better than the Merchandise of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold.</HI> Most certainly, to Secure all <HI>Spiritual Blessings in Heavenly pla∣ces,</HI> is a thing well worthy of the most ardent <HI>Zeal</HI> in the World; Worthy of a Greater than any thing in this World, yea, than to <HI>Gain the whole World.</HI> In the <HI>House</HI> of GOD are those <HI>Courts</HI> of the <HI>Hea∣venly places,</HI> where we Lay Hold on all <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> in <HI>Heavenly pla∣ces,</HI> and <HI>Lay Hold on Eternal Life.</HI> In Coming to the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, we must have a <HI>Zeal</HI> for the Good Things of the <HI>House,</HI> and a mighty Concern for that <HI>Blessedness:</HI> Psal. LXV. 4. <HI>We shall be satisfied with the Goodness of thy House, even of thy Ho∣ly Temple.</HI> Come to the <HI>House,</HI> with such a <HI>Zeal</HI> as this; <HI>I come hither, that I may know more of Him, whom to know is Life Eternal.</HI> Come with such a <HI>Zeal</HI> as this; <HI>I come hither, that I may be United unto my Savi∣our,
<PB N="21" REF="001913_0021_0FB9D6204C9730B8"/>
and Reconciled unto God.</HI> Come with such a <HI>Zeal</HI> as this; <HI>I come hither, that I may have the Lovely Graces of the Holy Spirit conferred on me, and Increased in me; and be made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> And come with such a <HI>Zeal</HI> as this; <HI>I come hither, that I may be Instructed in my Duty, and Strengthened against my Temptations, and Comforted under my Calamities, and filled with the Peace of GOD.</HI> A mighty Concern to make sure of the <HI>Salvation,</HI> whereof the <HI>Wells</HI> are O∣pened in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD: This is the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the <HI>House.</HI> To come thither with a Soul <HI>Hungring,</HI> and <HI>Thirsting</HI> after the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which is Revealed, and Offered, and Bestowed there; This is to be <HI>Eat∣en</HI> up with the <HI>Zeal.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>A Zeal</HI> Enkindled in the <HI>House of GOD;</HI> Is not this the <HI>Zeal of His House?</HI> And when that <HI>Zeal</HI> puts us upon <HI>Sacrificing</HI> our

All to GOD, may it not be said, <HI>The Zeal hath Eaten us up?</HI> We read of Notable Things to be done; and it is said, Isa. IX. 7. <HI>The Zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.</HI> It may partly be understood of a <HI>Zeal</HI> Enkindled by the <HI>Lord of Hosts.</HI> Thus <HI>a Zeal</HI> Enkindled in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, and by what passes there, may be called, <HI>The Zeal of the House.</HI> But the <HI>Zeal</HI> of <HI>Piety</HI> is no where more conspicuous, than in the <HI>Zeal</HI> of <HI>Sacrificing.</HI> With a <HI>Zeal of GOD</HI> mightily filling of our Souls, and flaming in them, we are to Surren∣der and Consecrate <HI>Our selves</HI> unto the Glorious GOD; Chuse to be <HI>Wholly the Lords;</HI> Long to be <HI>Entire∣ly for the Lord:</HI> Beg of His Holy Spirit, <HI>Oh! Do thou take possession of me.</HI> Yea, we are to bring our <HI>All</HI> under a <HI>Dedication</HI> unto the Glori∣ous GOD. Make a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>All,</HI> by having HOLINESS TO THE LORD, written upon ALL; and by a perpetual projection, that <HI>All</HI> may be applied unto the Service of

GOD: Have nothing, but what shall have the Character of a <HI>Sacri∣fice</HI> upon it; <HI>A Thing set apart for the Use of GOD.</HI> Yet more; We should be willing to <HI>Give up</HI> all our <HI>Good Things</HI> whenever GOD shall call us to it. Look upon all our <HI>Good Things</HI> with a <HI>Sacrificing Eye.</HI> Whatever we have any <HI>Relish</HI> for, we should come to this Disposition; <HI>Lord, If thou wilt have this Good Thing to be denied unto me, I am willing to go without it! Thy Will be done concerning it!</HI> Our <HI>Will</HI> should be <HI>Sacrificed</HI> unto the Lord; Be <HI>Extinguished</HI> and <HI>Abolished</HI> in the Lords.

to burn</HI> within them. And is not the <HI>Zeal</HI> now such as even to <HI>Eat us up?</HI> The <HI>Sacrifices</HI> of Old, were devoured, by a <HI>Fire</HI> Enkindled from Heaven upon them. The <HI>Lion of GOD,</HI> [The <HI>Altar,</HI> was called, <HI>Ariel,</HI> or, The <HI>Lion of GOD!</HI>] then did <HI>Eat up</HI> the <HI>Sacrifices.</HI> A <HI>Zeal</HI> Enkindled from Heaven in a Soul, <HI>Baptised with the Holy Spirit and with Fire, the Holy Spirit</HI> Shoo∣ting a <HI>Fire</HI> from above into the Soul, even like what was darted from the <HI>Shechinah</HI> upon the anci∣ent <HI>Sacrifices:</HI> (and like the <HI>Flame</HI> often visibly seen descending, and call'd the MANIFESTATION of the Spirit, on the <HI>Baptised</HI> in the Pri∣mitive Times,) does offer up it self and its All unto God in a <HI>Flame of Love.</HI> The <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> of GOD hath <HI>Eaten up</HI> such a Soul!</P>

<HI>Zealously</HI> and <HI>Mightily</HI> concerned, that He may <HI>himself</HI> be an House of GOD. Our <HI>Zeal</HI> must be concerned for this; Exod. XV. 2. <HI>My God, I will pre∣pare Him an Habitation.</HI> But how? Our <HI>Zeal</HI> must come into this <HI>Flame</HI> of the <HI>Fire of God; My GOD, I will my self be thy Habitation.</HI> A Good Man is himself a <HI>Living Temple</HI> of GOD. And it is most certain, One such <HI>Living Temple,</HI> is of more Account with the Glorious GOD, than any of <HI>Wood</HI> and of <HI>Stone,</HI> and of the most Exquisite Artifice that is to be seen, in the most Superb and Stately <HI>Cathedrals</HI> upon Earth. An humble Spirit, that is become <HI>an Habitation of God thro' the Spirit,</HI> is of more Account with GOD, than a <HI>Temple</HI> of meer <HI>matter</HI> without a <HI>Soul;</HI> tho' there should be more than Four Thousand Tun of Gold, and more than Forty Thousand Tun of Silver, laid out upon it: As according to the <HI>present Reading</HI> of the Text, there was upon one of old. A Good Man has

GOD so dwelling in him, that he becomes an <HI>House</HI> of GOD. But what must be our <HI>Zeal</HI> for such a Blessedness? It must be this. We must Exceedingly bewail and bemoan the condition, which by our <HI>Fall</HI> from GOD, mankind is fallen into. With Tears in our Eyes, we must see it the condition of a <HI>Temple</HI> in Rubbish; An <HI>House</HI> of GOD in Ru∣ines. Hereupon, we must heartily desire yea, very <HI>zealously,</HI> to be Raised out of this Deplorable Condition. In our JESUS we see the matchless <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD become a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> as the price of that Favour, that we may be re-edified a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. We are now to behold the SPIRIT of GOD, profering to Restore us, and Enter us, and Possess us, as an <HI>Holy Temple.</HI> We are Joyfully to accept of the proffer; Joyfully consent to the proffer; and say, <HI>Oh! Holy One, Do thou come into me, and Rectify all that is out of order within me; and fulfil in me all the Good pleasure of thy

Goodness.</HI> What remains is, That we be always Employ'd in those Things, to which an <HI>House</HI> of GOD is to be devoted; and that we abhor and avoid those things by which an House of GOD would be debased. The Zeal of coming at this Blessed∣ness, Oh! Let it make a wonder∣ful Impression upon us. It can't be said, That the <HI>Zeal of the House of</HI> GOD ha's <HI>eaten us up,</HI> Except the <HI>zeal</HI> and wish and care to be an <HI>House</HI> of GOD, be such as to <HI>Swallow up</HI> all our <HI>Temporal Concernments.</HI> Ex∣cept all our <HI>Temporal Concernments</HI> give way to this <HI>Grand Work</HI> of GOD: this <HI>Grand Aim</HI> of Christianity.</P>

<P>I. And now, how can we go any further without first making the pause of a <HI>Lamentation</HI> over it, That the <HI>Zeal of the House of</HI> GOD, seems to be so mightily departed from us; to be so mightily declined with us? Alas, Of how many may it be said; <HI>The Zeal of getting this World has Eaten

them up!</HI> Of how few; <HI>The Zeal of the House of GOD has Eaten them up!</HI> When the People of GOD could not see Him at Work for them, how Pathetically do they Expostulate! Isa. LXIII. 15. <HI>Where is thy Zeal?</HI> But, Oh! How may the Expostula∣tion be turned by our GOD upon our selves, who do so little for Him, and for His <HI>House,</HI> and mind so lit∣tle what becomes of it? <HI>Where is your Zeal.</HI> A <HI>Simon Zelotes,</HI> how rare to be found among the <HI>Disciples?</HI> How few <HI>Phinehas's</HI> in Publick Stations? How few <HI>Elias's</HI> to prepare the way of the Lord? Was not the Com∣plaint calculated for our Times, and may not the <HI>House</HI> of our GOD par∣ticularly complain? Mat. XXIV. 12. <HI>The Love of many shall wax Cold.</HI> The <HI>Burning</HI> of the World,—should it now come on; alas, the <HI>Cold</HI> Frame of the World, in regard of the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, and the Things thereof, it calls for <HI>Fire from Heaven! Where is our Zeal,</HI> when we are so Careless
<PB N="29" REF="001913_0029_0FB9D63C5896F7B8"/>
and so Lifeless, and so Drowsy, in the Business which we have to do in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD? So far from <HI>do∣ing with our might,</HI> what our <HI>Hand finds</HI> here to do? <HI>Where is our Zeal,</HI> when <HI>Church-fellowship</HI> is by so very many altogether neglected; tho' no cause can be assigned for this Neg∣lect, but only this, that Men can quietly leave the State of their Souls for Eternity, in horrible Uncertain∣ties? <HI>Where is our Zeal,</HI> when,—But <HI>That which is wanting, cannot be Numbred.</HI> It calls for a <HI>Lamentation</HI> over it.</P>
<P>II. But let not the <HI>Lamentation</HI> be a fruitless One. It must pass into an <HI>Exhortation.</HI> An Exhortation, which I could wish we had that <HI>Venerable</HI> Ancient here to manage; who in his Commentary on the Second of <HI>John,</HI> mentioning the <HI>Zeal</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR for the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, breaks forth into a Flame, <HI>Zelemur Et nos, Fratres Charissimi:</HI> O my dear Bre∣thren, shall not we be <HI>zealous</HI> too:
<PB N="30" REF="001913_0030_0FB9D63E8F687D10"/>
The Voice of our SAVIOUR from Heaven, unto Lukewarm <HI>Laodicea,</HI> must be the <HI>Exhortation:</HI> Rev. III. 19. <HI>Be zealous and Repent.</HI> Oh! may the <HI>Zeal of the House</HI> of GOD be now fired in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD; A <HI>Zeal,</HI> that like an <HI>Holy Fire,</HI> shall <HI>Eat up</HI> us, and <HI>Eat up</HI> all our Powers and Engage all our Endeavours, and all our Interests.</P>
<P>Briefly,</P>
<P>'Tis true, Our <HI>Zeal</HI> must be a <HI>Dis∣crete Zeal;</HI> A <HI>Zeal</HI> with <HI>Knowledge.</HI> Except there be <HI>Discretion</HI> to govern it, our <HI>Zeal</HI> will be like an Head-strong Horse wit out a <HI>Bridle;</HI> will run us into Inconveniencies. <HI>Church-History</HI> has told us, what horrid Conse∣quences once follow'd, upon the <HI>Rash Zeal</HI> of one Man pulling down an Idols Temple in the Kingdom of <HI>Persia.</HI> But as our <HI>Zeal</HI> must be <HI>Dis∣crete,</HI> so it must be <HI>Sincere.</HI> Not the <HI>Zeal</HI> of a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> which Extends no further than to the <HI>External.</HI> Not a <HI>Zeal</HI> acted by the <HI>Vain-glory</HI> of a
<PB N="31" REF="001913_0031_0FB9D6407763DAF8"/>
<HI>Jehu,</HI> who calls, <HI>come and see my Zeal?</HI> Oh! Beware of <HI>putting on Zeal for a Cloak,</HI> in another sense, than that wherein the Sacred Scripture uses that Expression. Whatever preten∣ces we make, let us Remember, we have to do, with a <HI>GOD that will not be mocked,</HI> in whatever we do. <HI>What is the Zeal of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when GOD shall take a∣way his Soul?</HI> and when <HI>Eyes like a Flame of Fire</HI> and more penetrating than the <HI>Lightning,</HI> shall pierce into it. What I now bespeak is, <HI>The Zeal of the House of GOD,</HI> and a <HI>mighty Concern</HI> for it. And I sollicit for Three wayes of Expressing such a <HI>Zeal.</HI></P>
<P>First. We are to Express a mighty <HI>Zeal,</HI> in <HI>Going</HI> to the <HI>House</HI> of GOD. Walk to the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, as often as you can; yea, tho' the walk may lye thro' a valley of <HI>Baca,</HI> and hath no little Trouble in it. Whatever <HI>Discouragements</HI> may lye in the way, let your <HI>Zeal</HI> overcome the discou∣ragements.
<PB N="32" REF="001913_0032_0FB9D642220E1FD8"/>
Let neither <HI>Heat</HI> nor <HI>Cold,</HI> nor any Conquerable Hardships discourage you. But let the Cry of your <HI>Zeal</HI> be that; Psal XLII. 1. <HI>As the Hart makes a panting Cry for cooling Streams of water; so my Soul makes a panting cry to thee, O mighty God.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. We are to Express a mighty <HI>Zeal</HI> in <HI>Working</HI> at the <HI>House</HI> of GOD. Be in Earnest, about all that is to be done there. Our <HI>Zeal</HI> in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, must so trans∣port us. Psal LXXXIV. 2. <HI>My Heart and my Flesh crueth out for the Living GOD.</HI> Our <HI>Heart</HI> as well as our <HI>Flesh,</HI> must be in what we do <HI>Pray;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so as to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> but so as to <HI>make melody in your Hearts</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord. <HI>Heart</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Shake them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

House of GOD. Yea, Do <HI>with all your might</HI> for it, as the <HI>Zeal</HI> of <HI>David</HI> once did what he did before the <HI>Ark;</HI> When the <HI>Angel</HI> of God possessing him threw him into the usual <HI>Prophetick Agitations.</HI> He said, Psal. CXXII. 9. <HI>Because of the House of the Lord our GOD, I will seek thy Good.</HI> Oh! <HI>Seek the Good</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> of the Lord our GOD. Often think, <HI>What shall I do for the House of God? Mercy and Truth</HI> will be to them who devise Good, for the House of GOD.</P>
<P>¶ And now, my Brethren, unto you, who professing a <HI>Zeal for the House of GOD,</HI> have here built an HOUSE, wherein you propose to have His Worship carried on; What can we wish? For we would wish you <HI>all the Good of His House,</HI> and that is indeed all the <HI>Good</HI> that can be wish'd for!—But what can we wish, that shall be a better <HI>Symptom,</HI> or a better <HI>Success</HI> of your <HI>Zeal,</HI> than, That the <HI>House</HI> you have built may

have that Felicity Illuminating of it; Isa. LX. 7. <HI>I will Glorify the House of my Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Not only, is a <HI>Church</HI> of Believers <HI>Associating</HI> for the Worship of our SAVIOUR, to be an <HI>House of His Glory;</HI> And you especially, that are here laying the <HI>Foundation</HI> of a <HI>New Church,</HI> ought in a singular manner, to be so; to be Persons of such Glo∣rious Piety, that your <HI>Maker</HI> and <HI>Builder</HI> may say, <HI>I have laid thy Foun∣dation with Stones more precious than Agates, and Sapphires:</HI> But also, the <HI>Artificial House</HI> wherein such a <HI>Church</HI> does carry on the Worship of our SAVIOUR, may become an <HI>House of His Glory too.</HI> Oh! may this <HI>House,</HI> where an <HI>Assembly of Zion</HI> is from this time to meet continually, be al∣ways an <HI>House of our SAVIOUR's Glory.</HI></P>
<P>My Brethren; It will be so! This <HI>House</HI> will be an <HI>House of your SA∣VIOUR's Glory,</HI> if the <HI>Exercises</HI> per∣formed in this <HI>House</HI> of your <HI>solemn

Assemblies,</HI> be filled with Acknow∣ledgements of a Glorious CHRIST, and of His <HI>Glory;</HI> and if your SA∣VIOUR may see that Character up∣on the House; Psal. XXIX. 9. <HI>In His Temple does every one speak of His Glory.</HI></P>
<P>May the <HI>Prayers</HI> made in this House, be filled with Confessions of the <HI>Glory</HI> belonging to our SAVI∣OUR! <HI>Prayers</HI> that shall magnify our SAVIOUR, as the <HI>Redeemer</HI> of his People, and place all their Hopes and Joyes upon His <HI>Mediation! Prayers</HI> that shall be so many <HI>Flights</HI> unto our SAVIOUR, as the <HI>only Re∣fuge</HI> of our Souls!</P>
<P>May the <HI>Sermons</HI> made in this House, Every where sparkle with Confessions of our SAVIOUR's <HI>Glory</HI> in them! <HI>Sermons</HI> that shall have the <HI>Mystery of CHRIST</HI> Laboriously Explained in them, and be fill'd with Lively and Lovely Representa∣tions of our only SAVIOUR! <HI>Ser∣mons</HI> that shall still terminate Every point in a CHRIST, and lead men

unto our SAVIOUR upon all Occa∣sions!</P>
<P>When the Songs of <HI>Zion</HI> are sung in this <HI>House of GOD,</HI> may our SA∣VIOUR be often found in our <HI>Psalms?</HI> The <HI>Psalm-Book</HI> still be taken as, <HI>The Book of the Messiah!</HI> And the <HI>Psalms</HI> made so many <HI>Mictams,</HI> wherein something of the Glorious CHRIST shall be found, as the <HI>Golden Embroide∣ry</HI> upon the more obvious and Com∣mon Cloth, which lies there before us!</P>
<P>Finally; When you come to have the <HI>Seals</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> administred in this <HI>House</HI> of GOD, may our SA∣VIOUR be still Exhibited as the <HI>Head</HI> of His People in the <HI>Covenant!</HI> May all be done, to List <HI>Souldiers</HI> under the <HI>Banner</HI> of our SAVIOUR! All be done to Confirm the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR in their Adherence to Him! All be done Evidently to <HI>set forth</HI> a Glorious CHRIST, <HI>as Cru∣cified before your Eyes!</HI> Behold, How ere I am aware, I have described the

<HI>Minister</HI> which we wish your <HI>Election</HI> may fall upon. Can you find a Man, that is like to bring this Glory upon you! The <HI>Dove</HI> that lit upon <HI>Fabia∣nus</HI> when the Church was chusing a Minister, would not give your choice a more sure Direction. My Friends upon the <HI>Meeting-Place,</HI> where the <HI>Assemblies</HI> are thus Entertain'd in Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> there is a <HI>Glory,</HI> even the <HI>Glory</HI> of our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>But, Oh! How much will our SAVIOUR <HI>Glorify</HI> such an <HI>House of His Glory!</HI> Verily, There will be <HI>Glo∣rious Effects</HI> of his <HI>Grace,</HI> on the Souls of the People which Assemble there; and by such notable <HI>Effects</HI> of His <HI>Grace,</HI> this <HI>House</HI> will be, how greatly <HI>Glorified!</HI> It was a Thing once ask'd for; Psal LXIII. 2. <HI>To see thy Power and thy Glory, so as I have seen thee in the Sanctuary.</HI> The <HI>powerful Grace</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR by the <HI>Power</HI> of His <HI>Grace,</HI> will do great Things for the Souls of Men in this <HI>House of His Glory;</HI> Such Things as to make

In such a <HI>Free course</HI> for it, the <HI>Word</HI> is <HI>Glo∣rified;</HI> and so will be the <HI>House</HI> which has the Dispensations of it. <HI>Greater Kindnesses</HI> will here be done for them, than what were done in the <HI>Ancient Miracles</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR: The very <HI>Dead</HI> will come to <HI>Live unto</HI> GOD: And Oh! how will He <HI>Manifest forth His Glory</HI> in them! This <HI>House</HI> will thereby be∣come a <HI>pleasant Place</HI> unto the <HI>Chil∣dren of Zion</HI> that Assemble here.

met with much of my glorious Lord in this House of the Lord, and seen the Glory of my SAVIOUR here; Thy goings, O my King, in the Sanctuary! And therefore this is an House which I cannot but have an unspeakable value for: Here, Here will I dwell,; for I have desired it.</HI></P>
<P>Such an House, is the <HI>One Thing</HI> that we now <HI>desire</HI> for you; and we desire you to <HI>seek after it,</HI> that you may <HI>dwell</HI> in such an <HI>House of the Lord all the Days</HI> of your Lives, <HI>to behold the Glory of the Lord!</HI></P>
<P>Now, that you may be in a more likely way to see this Felicity it is above all things to be desired, and you, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> are to-be earnestly Exhorted, <HI>That Brotherly love may Continue,</HI> and that no Sinful <HI>Contenti∣on</HI> may arise among you; <HI>Contention,</HI> which will bring on <HI>Confusion and every Evil Work.</HI> You have hitherto carried on your undertaking, with an uncommon Quiet, and Silence, and Satisfaction; Little Noise of

The CITY of BOSTON, [for its being a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Populous</HI> Town, and the <HI>Head</HI> of adjacent Villages, is enough to challenge the Denomination of a CITY for it;] has had a Remarkable Smile of GOD our SAVIOUR upon it, which <HI>you</HI> invite us this Day to take notice of. Tho' Desolations by <HI>Fire,</HI> among other Impediments to the growth of the Place, laid the Two Eldest of our <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI> in ashes, and so the <HI>Oldest</HI> we have standing is Two or Three less than <HI>Fifty</HI> years Old, yet we may now see no less than TEN Houses, wherein Christi∣ans hold their Publick and Weekly Assemblies, for the Worship of GOD our SAVIOUR. And some of them very <HI>Capacious</HI> Edifices; none of them <HI>Contemptible.</HI></P>
<P>Of these Assemblies, (including that at <HI>Romny Marsh,</HI>) there are no less than SEVEN, [Oh! May

they be so many <HI>Golden Candlesticks!</HI>] which are Churches of the UNITED BRETHREN, keeping in the Wayes of our <HI>New-English</HI> Churches. A∣mong these, there are some Differen∣ces in some small <HI>Circumstantials</HI> and <HI>Modalities,</HI> which are not the least Interruption unto the Comforts of mutual Communion. And tho' no <HI>Parochial</HI> Bounds are settled, but the People belonging to each Live intermix'd with one another, this al∣so breeds no manner of Disturbance in the World.</P>
<P>There are three more; whereof one is of the <HI>French Protestants;</HI> which if we should call it, <HI>The Eighth,</HI> yet it is <HI>of the Seven.</HI></P>
<P>The other Two, if they do not Express <HI>Communion</HI> to such a Degree as the rest; yet All the <HI>TEN</HI> carry on so Lovingly, so Peaceably, so De∣cently, and all the Offices of Good Neighbourhood are, in such a Dis∣tinguishing

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THese words, are part of the <HI>Message</HI> which our Lord Jesus Christ sent to the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church of <HI>Thyatira,</HI> &amp; to that <HI>Church,</HI> v. 18. There were some things among them much <HI>commended,</HI> others as plainly
<PB N="2" REF="001913_0047_0FB9D67079988D78"/>
<HI>condemned.</HI> The <HI>Commendation</HI> is, 19. <HI>I know thy works, and charity, service, and faith, and patience, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</HI> Note, we should grow <HI>more and more</HI> such as God com∣mands us to be: our succeeding works should be more and better than our preceeding ones. We should <HI>grow in grace,</HI> 2 Pet. 3. 18. It's not enough to be <HI>stedfast and unmovea∣ble,</HI> but we should be <HI>always abound∣ing in the work of the Lord,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 58. We ought so to walk as to <HI>please God,</HI> and <HI>abound more and more</HI> therein. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 1. Our <HI>last works should be more than our first.</HI> Tho' there were in this Church at <HI>Thya∣tira,</HI> some things very <HI>commendable,</HI> yet there were others very <HI>blame∣worthy.</HI> v. 20. <HI>I have a few things a∣gainst thee.</HI> Note by the way, If particular persons or Churches have very good things in them, that's not sufficient ground to cry them up and applaud them, as tho' there were no fault to be found with them: there may be very good things in them, yet possibly some very bad ones too. On the other
<PB N="3" REF="001913_0048_0FB9D6724BCA0160"/>
hand, if particular persons or Church∣es have some very bad and abomina∣ble things in them, that's no sufficient ground to cry them down, as though there were nothing good in them. There were in the Church of <HI>Thyati∣ra</HI> (as well as in several others of the <HI>Asian</HI> Churches) very <HI>good things,</HI> which our Lord <HI>commends;</HI> yet there were a <HI>few things</HI> which he had a∣gainst them.</P>
<P>The fault our Lord finds with <HI>Thya∣tira</HI> is, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Thou sufferest that woman</HI> Jezebel, <HI>which calleth her self a Prophe∣tess, to teach and to seduce my Servants to commit Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols.</HI> This Woman pre∣tended to be a <HI>Prophetess,</HI> tho' really she was not. Some think she's call'd <HI>Jezebel,</HI> from her <HI>likeness</HI> to the Wife of King <HI>Ahab</HI> in promoting <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and other Wickedness. She had a space given her to repent, but she re∣pented not. <HI>v.</HI> 21. Her Impudent Wickedness, in seducing the Servants of Christ to those great Crimes of <HI>Fornication</HI> and <HI>Idolatry;</HI> should have been witnessed against by <HI>Church-Cen∣sures,</HI> the neglect of this, and so the suffering of (and bearing with) <HI>her
<PB N="4" REF="001913_0049_0FB9D67630245358"/>
in her wickedness,</HI> was their great sin, and very provoking to Christ. Note,</P>
<P><HI>The Lord Jesus would have good Dis∣cipline upheld in his Churches.</HI> The Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> was commended for this. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 2. <HI>Thou canst not bear them which are evil.</HI> Those who are known to be <HI>Heretical</HI> in Opinion, or <HI>grosly scandalous</HI> in Practice, ought not to be allow'd in the Churches of Christ: if by proper means they won't be reform'd, they should be Excommunicated <HI>Where∣fore put away from among your selves that wicked person.</HI> 1 Cor. 5. 13. <HI>A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second Admonition, reject.</HI> So, those <HI>Scandalous</HI> in <HI>Practice</HI> that won't be reform'd, are to be treated as <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Publicans.</HI> Mat. 18. 17. It's a thing very provoking to our Lord Jesus, that those known to be grosly scandalous in Opinion or Prac∣tice; should be allow'd in Fellowship and Communion in any of his Chur∣ches.</P>
<P>Our Lord nextly proceeds to <HI>threat∣en</HI> this <HI>Jezebel. v.</HI> 22. <HI>I will cast her into a Bed, and them that commit A∣dultery with her into great tribulation,
<PB N="5" REF="001913_0050_0FB9D679DD03C3D0"/>
except they repent of their deeds.</HI> v. 23. <HI>And I will kill her Children</HI> (which may comprehend her <HI>Disciples, Fol∣lowers,</HI> those that were <HI>seduc'd</HI> by her) <HI>with death.</HI> That is, with the <HI>Plague,</HI> (as some think) or the <HI>Second Death,</HI> (as others) or the phrase may be look'd on as an <HI>Haebraism, In killing I will kill;</HI> that is, our Lord would <HI>cer∣tainly and terribly destroy them.</HI> Next to this clause, comes in our Text, <HI>All the Churches shall know, that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you ac∣cording to your works.</HI> This plainly implies, that the Churches <HI>should</HI> serve Christ with their <HI>hearts and reins,</HI> that is, <HI>sincerely, uprightly.</HI> This being <HI>suppos'd,</HI> 'tis asserted, that Christ <HI>knows</HI> whether they do so or no, for he <HI>searches</HI> the <HI>hearts and reins:</HI> 'tis also asserted, that the <HI>Churches shall know this,</HI> they shall <HI>know that he searches the hearts,</HI> for he will <HI>give to every one according to his works.</HI> Accordingly, we may take these three heads for the Subject of our present Discourse, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> (1.) <HI>The Churches should serve the Lord Jesus Christ with their hearts.</HI> (2.) <HI>He knows whether they do so or
<PB N="6" REF="001913_0051_0FB9D680281FFCE8"/>
to.</HI> (3.) <HI>All the Churches, shall know this, because he'll give to every one ac∣cording to his works.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>The Churches should Serve the Lord Jesus Christ with their hearts.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ is a Divine Person, God as well as Man; there∣fore the highest Service and Obedi∣ence are due to him. <HI>Joh.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 23. <HI>All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father; they that ho∣noureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</HI> 'Tis the duty indeed of the very <HI>Heathen,</HI> to Serve God according to the best knowledge of his Perfections, and of his Will, which they can attain to; but inasmuch as our Text speaks of the <HI>Churches,</HI> those <HI>Societies</HI> or <HI>Assemblies</HI> of men and women who have God's <HI>Revealed Will,</HI> profess to <HI>believe</HI> it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shall at present confine my Dis∣course only to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but <HI>One Ca∣tholick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> the <HI>Church <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> All that are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had be) Savingly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and with him. Our Lord said,
<PB N="7" REF="001913_0052_0FB9D68519D098C8"/>
<HI>Joh.</HI> 6 37. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh I will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus has but <HI>One Catho∣lick Visible Church</HI> in the World; comprehending all those, (with their Children) who profess him to be their Prince and Saviour, their Pro∣phet, Priest and King; and own his Word to be the Rule of their Faith, Worship and Conversation. But those who make this Profession, be∣ing very numerous, and dwelling in places far distant from one another, can't possibly meet in any one place to attend Divine Worship; they are therefore necessitated to meet in sun∣dry distinct Bodies and Societies, if they would Worship God as he di∣rects them. And such particular <HI>Bo∣dies</HI> or <HI>Societies</HI> of Christians, thus meeting to Worship God in Christ Jesus, according to the Rules of his Word, are in the Plural Number cal∣led <HI>Churches.</HI> So we read of the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Galatia.</HI> 1 Cor. 16. 1. The <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Judea.</HI> Gal. 1. 22. Now all such particular Churches, <HI>should</HI> Serve Christ <HI>with their hearts,</HI> sincere∣ly and uprightly. <HI>Let every one that
<PB N="8" REF="001913_0053_0FB9D68638B040B8"/>
nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 19. And now <HI>Isra∣el,</HI> what doth the Lord thy God re∣quire of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and <HI>to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,</HI> Deut. 10. 12. So <HI>David</HI> said to his Son <HI>Solomon.</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <HI>Know thou the God of thy Fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind.</HI> Their <HI>Serving of Christ with their hearts,</HI> may comprehend,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Their sincere repentance of Sin, and faith in Christ Jesus.</HI> Sin is the work of the Devil, Christ came to de∣stroy the works of the Devil, to save his people from their sins, to make them holy and happy. When the Apostle Preach'd the Gospel, he principally Inculcated on his Hearers, the duty of <HI>Repentance towards God, &amp; Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, Acts</HI> 20. 21. Persons must <HI>repent</HI> or <HI>perish;</HI> must grieve and mourn for their sins, hate and forsake them, or be miserable for ever. They must <HI>re∣pent and turn from all their transgressi∣ons, else Iniquity will be their ruin, Ezek.</HI> 18. 30. Together with their loa∣thing
<PB N="9" REF="001913_0054_0FB9D687C6CEDBE0"/>
of sin, they must trust in the me∣ritorious righteousness of Christ for their Justification before God. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. 23. <HI>This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Je∣sus Christ.</HI> And whosoever believes in him, shall have <HI>remission of sins,</HI> (Acts 10. 43.) but <HI>he that believeth not, shall be damned,</HI> Mark 16. 16. The Lord Je∣sus requires, that all under the Gospel should heartily repent of their sins, hate and turn from them; trust in his meritorious righteousness, and power∣ful Intercession, for the acceptance of their persons and sincere (tho' Imper∣fect) performances with God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their ordering their Conversation in general, as the Gospel directs.</HI> The heart is the spring &amp; fountain of mens tho'ts, words and actions. Therefore as their <HI>hearts</HI> should hate sin, trust in Christ, love and obey God; so, from such <HI>a prevailing principle within,</HI> the whole outward behaviour should be conform'd to the Precepts of the Gos∣pel. They should <HI>fear God and keep his Commandments,</HI> (Eccl. 12. 13) <HI>Glorifie him with their bodies and spirits; what∣soever they do, they should do it to his glory.</HI> 1 Cor. 6. 20. and 10. 31. They
<PB N="10" REF="001913_0055_0FB9D689425B4D50"/>
should <HI>deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, live soberly, righteously, godlily in this present world,</HI> (Tit. 2. 12.) <HI>clean∣sing themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 7. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Their attending Divine Worship, and managing the affairs of God's House according to the Rules of his Word.</HI> In matters of Religion, we do but Wor∣ship God in vain, if we take <HI>Humane Inventions</HI> for our Rule. We must <HI>to the Law and to the Testimony,</HI> (Isa. 8. 20.) and try Doctrines and Practices by the Word of God, if we would <HI>hold fast that which is good.</HI> 1 Thes. 5. 21. We should keep close to the <HI>Pat∣tern in the Mount,</HI> lest God should say to us of this or that practice, <HI>Who hath required this at your hands?</HI> Wor∣ship should be paid to God, for the <HI>pleasing and honouring of him,</HI> and the <HI>profiting our own Souls;</HI> and the latter of these depends on the former; in these things, nothing can <HI>profit</HI> us, but what is <HI>pleasing</HI> to God. Therefore we should make his Word our Rule, in all the Affairs of his <HI>House</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> and indeed in all other things. Therefore if we would <HI>prove</HI> and <HI>evi∣dence</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001913_0056_0FB9D68AAEB5E6A8"/>
our <HI>love</HI> and <HI>friendship</HI> to Christ, we must <HI>do whatsoever he commands us</HI> (<HI>Joh.</HI> 14. 15. &amp; 15. 14.) and we need do no more. Therefore we should carefully <HI>Sanctifie</HI> the <HI>Sabbath</HI> or <HI>Lord's Day;</HI> in a constant course seasonably attend the <HI>Preaching of God's</HI> Word; and receive the <HI>Sacraments, Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as the Scripture directs. It's a very great sin (what∣ever some think of it) to neglect ei∣ther <HI>Baptism</HI> or the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as too many of the professed Disciples of Christ do. So, in our several Stations and Capacities, we should do what we can that the <HI>Doctrine, Worship, Disci∣pline</HI> of Christ, may be upheld in their purity in his Churches according to his Word. Indeed in all things, we should make <HI>his Word</HI> the <HI>Lamp of our feet, &amp; the light of our paths,</HI> Ps. 119. 105.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Their carrying it becomingly in the several Relations they sustain.</HI> 1 Cor. 7. 24. <HI>Let every man wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</HI> As in general, Christians should <HI>love their neighbours as themselves,</HI> so (which is truly com∣prehended in it) they should faithful∣ly <HI>perform the duties</HI> of those several <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Capacities</HI> they sustain,
<PB N="12" REF="001913_0057_0FB9D690A20C6670"/>
whether as <HI>Husbands</HI> or <HI>Wives, Pa∣rents</HI> or <HI>Children, Masters</HI> or <HI>Servants, Ministers</HI> or <HI>Hearers, Magistrates</HI> or <HI>Subjects.</HI> For they should behave them∣selves, as <HI>good Stewards of God's mani∣fold grace,</HI> (1 Pet. 4. 10.) and as they <HI>have opportunity, do good to all men, Gal.</HI> 6. 10. and should <HI>do to others, as they would that others</HI> (in like cases) <HI>should do to them,</HI> Luk.6 31.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Their living as becomes Strangers in this World, and Heirs of Heaven.</HI> To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace Therefore they should <HI>set their affecti∣ons on things above, not on things on the earth,</HI> Col. 3. 2. They should mortifie and subdue their carnal earthly affecti∣ons; and lay up for themselves <HI>not treasures on earth,</HI> where moth &amp; rust corrupt, and thieves break thro' and steal; but <HI>treasures in heaven,</HI> which are not liable to such hazards. <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 19. They should pass the time of their <HI>Sojourning here in fear,</HI> 1 Pet. 11. 17. Their <HI>treasures, hearts</HI> and <HI>Conversati∣ons</HI> should be in heaven. Such a dispo∣sition of Soul towards God as the Psal∣mist express'd, very well becomes them, Psal. 73. 25, 26. <HI>Whom have I in heaven
<PB N="13" REF="001913_0058_0FB9D697750F5408"/>
but thee,? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee: My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</HI> Thus, Churches and Christians should serve Christ <HI>with their hearts;</HI> what has been briefly hinted, <HI>proves</HI> it to be their <HI>duty</HI> to do so; tho' it might also be more abundantly evidenc'd, were it needful, or would time permit the doing it. We therefore proceed to the next general head, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>2. <HI>He knows whether they do so or no.</HI> Christ Jesus is God as well as man, and therefore necessarily <HI>knows</HI> whether persons are <HI>hypocrites</HI> or <HI>sincere,</HI> in the profession they make of Religion. This is necessarily imply'd or intended in those words of our Text, <HI>I am he that searcheth the reins and the hearts.</HI> In a literal sense, the <HI>reins</HI> and <HI>hearts</HI> are <HI>Internal parts</HI> of the body, &amp; quite out of the sight of men; yet God sees them. <HI>For there is not any Creature that is not manifest in his sight, all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. 4. 13. But the <HI>reins</HI> and <HI>hearts,</HI> in our Text are taken in a metaphorical or figura∣tive sense, to signifie the <HI>Rational Souls</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001913_0059_0FB9D69A337A8338"/>
of men, with their <HI>immediate designs, purposes, thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. For tho' these are secret from the view of other men, yet they lie open to Christ's view. He <HI>searches</HI> them, the meaning is, he <HI>per∣fectly sees, knows, and is acquainted</HI> with them. Persons often <HI>pretend</HI> to have those designs and inclinations, which are not really in them; and thereby they may deceive men who can judge only by outward appearance. They may <HI>outwardly appear righteous to men, while inwardly they are full of iniquity and hypocrisie,</HI> Mat. 23 28. But the Lord Jesus, whose <HI>eyes are a flame of fire,</HI> cannot be thus impos'd upon, or de∣ceived. He not only knows mens <HI>words</HI> and <HI>outward actions,</HI> but also as fully knows their <HI>hearts,</HI> all their <HI>de∣signs, desires</HI> and <HI>purposes.</HI> He <HI>knows the things that come into their minds, e∣ven every one of them,</HI> Ezek. 21. 5. If they act agreeably to his Will, sincere∣ly desiring and designing to glorifie him; he sees and approves their since∣rity, tho' men possibly may tax them with <HI>Formality, Hypocrisie,</HI> and by si∣nister ends in what they do. So on the other hand, if they make the most pious shows and pretences, and shine
<PB N="15" REF="001913_0060_0FB9D69B354A2E70"/>
like Angels, in the opinion of men; yet if they secretly and chiefly aim at their own applause, outward profit or advantage in the matter; then the Lord Jesus plainly sees and greatly ab∣hors, their cursed mockery and hypo∣crisie. Therefore he could say of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who made wondrous shows of Piety; <HI>all their works they do to be seen of men,</HI> Mat. 23. 5. It was for a <HI>pretence</HI> that they <HI>made long prayers;</HI> they made great shews of piety, that they might the more easily <HI>devour Wi∣dows houses.</HI> Their pretence to Serve God, was made use of to serve &amp; gratifie their own cursed lusts and corruptions. So that when men may almost esteem such and such (on the account of their pious pretences) to be <HI>Angels of light;</HI> possibly the Lord may know (because of their secret hypocrisie) that they are more like <HI>Devils Incarnate.</HI> It is most certain, that the Lord Jesus per∣fectly sees and knows the hearts of all men, and all that is in them. <HI>He sees not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart,</HI> 1 Sam. 16. 7. <HI>Jesus knew all men; and needed not that any should testifie of man, for he knew what was in
<PB N="16" REF="001913_0061_0FB9D69F3944D3E0"/>
man,</HI> Joh. 2. 24, 25. And as the Lord Jesus <HI>knows the hearts and thoughts</HI> of all men; So the last generad head tells us,</P>
<P>3. <HI>All the Churches shall know this, be∣cause he'll give to every one according to his works.</HI></P>
<P>It's probable that this latter part of our Text, does more immediately and directly intend, that the Lord Jesus would bring upon <HI>Jezebel</HI> &amp; her wick∣ed followers, such <HI>remarkable destruct∣ive Judgments</HI> for their wicked works; as should <HI>demonstrate to all the Church∣es</HI> that heard of them, <HI>that he knew their hearts. Jezebel</HI> pretended to be a <HI>Prophetess,</HI> extraordinarily Inspired and taught of God, tho' indeed she was not. So, calling her self a <HI>Pro∣phetess,</HI> she pretended that her <HI>Doct∣rines were Divine;</HI> and might very likely insinuate, that 'twas but a part of <HI>Christian Liberty</HI> to practice such <HI>Fornication</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> as she incou∣couraged. But the Lord Jesus knew all the <HI>deceit, pride, presumption, wick∣edness of her heart,</HI> and of the hearts of her followers; and would in his spotless all governing Providence make such discoveries thereof, and bring such
<PB N="17" REF="001913_0062_0FB9D6A45546C318"/>
Judgments therefor, as should <HI>fully con∣vince the Churches</HI> (for their awaken∣ing, warning, caution) that he knew the <HI>wickedness of their hearts,</HI> and was righteous in the Judgments he inflict∣ed for their Crimes. God sometimes executes such remarkable vengeance on the wicked, that a man shall say, <HI>Veri∣ly he is a God that Judgeth in the earth. Psa.</HI> 58. 10,11. <HI>The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth, the wick∣ed is snared in the work of his own hands, Psa.</HI> 9.16. Thus God sometimes remar∣kably and evidently manifests his <HI>Om∣niscience, Holiness, Righteousness,</HI> in the <HI>visible Judgments</HI> he brings on particu∣lar <HI>persons</HI> or <HI>Societies</HI> of men here in this World. And probably this (as was hinted but now) is what is more immediately, primarily and directly intended in our Text.</P>
<P>Yet our Text is by no means to be confined, limited or restrained to this sense. For in this World God does not always make a manifest evident di∣stinction between the good and bad, <HI>by giving to every one according to his works.</HI> We're plainly told, Eccl. 8. 14.—<HI>There be just men to whom it happeneth accord∣ing to the work of the wicked; &amp; again,
<PB N="18" REF="001913_0063_0FB9D6A8D09963C0"/>
there be wicked men, unto whom it hap∣peneth according to the work of the righ∣teous.</HI> Sometimes <HI>the way of the wick∣ed does prosper,</HI> Jer. 12. 1. <HI>The wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he,</HI> (Hab. 1. 13.) while <HI>the godly are plagued all the day long, and chastened every morning,</HI> Psal. 73. 14. Well, but the Lord Jesus who knows perfectly well <HI>all the thoughts, words and actions, of all men;</HI> will be the Universal Righ∣teous Judge of the whole world; and in the <HI>Judgment-day</HI> he'll make it ma∣nifest &amp; known to <HI>all persons, all Chur∣ches,</HI> yea to <HI>all Nations,</HI> (for they shall he cited before him. Mat. 25. 32.) <HI>that he searches the reins and the hearts,</HI> and that by his <HI>giving to every one accord∣ing to his works.</HI> At that time Christ <HI>will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, &amp; the counsels of the heart shall be made manifest.</HI> 1. Cor. 4. 5. At that time most fully and remarkable, <HI>he will render to every man according to his deeds. To them who by patient conti∣nuance in well doing, do seek for glory, honour and immortality, eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey un∣righteousness, indignation and wrath, tri∣bulation and anguish, on every soul of
<PB N="19" REF="001913_0064_0FB9D6AA417FB678"/>
man that doth evil.</HI> Rom. 2. 6—9. God says, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 10. <HI>I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <HI>We must all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body; according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Then</HI> the <HI>secret</HI> (as well as open) Sins of the Wicked, tho' they had been cloak'd with never so splendid preten∣ces of Piety, shall be laid open to the view of all men and Angels; &amp; have just punishment inflicted for them <HI>Then</HI> also shall the <HI>secret</HI> (as well as o∣pen) duties of the Saints, their <HI>holy desires, designs, secret prayers, sincerity of heart</HI> in those actions which men were ready to charge with formality and hypocrisie; I say, these things shall be laid open, made publick to the view of all; and shall be graciously reward∣ed by Christ the Judge of all. The Last Day, the Great Day of Judgment, will be the great day of <HI>distinction &amp; separation</HI> between the <HI>Sheep</HI> and the <HI>Goats,</HI> the <HI>Wheat</HI> and the <HI>Chaff,</HI> the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Ungodly.</HI> Then, even at that time most evidently, fully and
<PB N="20" REF="001913_0065_0FB9D6AC60BA7E88"/>
remarkably, <HI>will the Lord Jesus give to every one according to his works.</HI></P>
<P>We may now proceed to the <HI>Use,</HI> and may Infer from what has been said.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We should never content our selves, meerly with Externals in Religion.</HI> It's true, we should acquaint our selves with the Gospel of Christ, believe it, profess our belief of it and subjection to it. We should atttend Gods Holy Worship and Ordinances, and so con∣form our words and outward actions to the precepts of the Gospel, as that Men may have nothing remarkable to say against us, Phil. 2. 15. <HI>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God without rebuke.</HI> But we should by no means content our selves, meer∣ly with what is outward and visible in Religion. There may be a form of godliness, where there's nothing of the power of it. To have a name to live, and yet be dead; is a terrible condition to be in.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We should not think our selves
<PB N="21" REF="001913_0066_0FB9D6AD41790788"/>
sincere, Saints, meerly because Men e∣steem us so.</HI> Men can Judge only by outward appearance, 1 Sam. 16. 7. Even <HI>good men</HI> may be mistaken about us, and think much better of us than we really are. Did not holy <HI>Abraham</HI> charitably hope, that there might be <HI>fifty righteous persons in Sodom,</HI> when God the <HI>searcher of Hearts</HI> knew there were <HI>not ten</HI> there? Gen. 18.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Our great business should be, to approve our Hearts right and sincere before God.</HI> Without this, all our shows of Religion will avail nothing to our Salvation. Not one hypocrite shall go to Heaven. Many of the <HI>Children of the Kingdom</HI> (those who belong to Christ's visible Church in this world) <HI>shall be cast into outer darkness,</HI> Mat. 8. 12. Many Professors, many Church-members will be dam∣ned in Hell for ever; yea and many <HI>Preachers</HI> as well as <HI>Professors</HI> of the Gospel. <HI>Many</HI> will say to Christ, Lord, Lord, <HI>have we not prophesied in thy name</HI> (that is, preach'd his Word)
<PB N="22" REF="001913_0067_0FB9D6B003B612C0"/>
and yet he'll say to them, <HI>I never knew you, depart from me ye that work Iniqui∣ty,</HI> Mat. 7. 22, 23. We should there∣fore see to it, that we heartily re∣pent of Sin, believe in Christ, love and obey God. We must have Faith that purifies the Heart and works by love, else we must perish for ever. No outward shows of Re∣ligion, Intitle us to Heaven; none but the <HI>pure in Heart</HI> shall see God. If there were a great Assembly of Professors together, and but <HI>one hypo∣crite</HI> among them; he should perish &amp; all the rest be saved. So, if there were among them but <HI>one sincere Saint,</HI> he should be saved; and all the rest should be damned. We should there∣fore strive (like the Apostle) <HI>to please God who trieth our hearts,</HI> 1 Thes. 2. 4.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Particular Churches should make Christ's glory their end, and his Word their rule in all they do.</HI> The Lord Jesus knows the heart designs and In∣tentions of all, not only consider'd in their single capacity as individual
<PB N="23" REF="001913_0068_0FB9D6C34FC2BE88"/>
persons; but also consider'd as parts or members of any Society or Com∣munity. Therefore <HI>Churches</HI> as such, should Endeavour to approve them∣seves to Christ in all they do: For he is the Head of the body the Church, the Builder and Owner of the Church which is his House. And if they would approve themselves to him, they should aim at his glory &amp; make his word their rule, in all they do.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is their duty.</HI> They should <HI>observe all things whatsoever Christ has Commanded,</HI> Mat. 28. 20. <HI>He is thy Lord, and Worship thou him,</HI> Psal. 45. 11. Christ has <HI>purchas'd his Church with his own blood,</HI> and since he has so <HI>bought them with a price; they should glorify him with their bodies and Spirits which are his,</HI> Act. 20. 28. 1 Cor. 6. 20</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This is their Honour.</HI> When per∣sons make a true and right professi∣on, tis their honour to act agreeably thereto; for therein they show their Integrity and Uprightness. Churches
<PB N="24" REF="001913_0069_0FB9D6CB70804A50"/>
(as well as particular Christians) can't honour themselves more, than in walking and acting as Christ (whom they profess to be their Lord and Master) commands them to do. Christ said to the Angel of the Church of <HI>Philadelphia, thou hast kept my word;</HI> and the Exhortation he then gave was, <HI>hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown,</HI> Rev. 3. 8, 11. While <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> keep close to the Word of Christ and act agreeably thereto, 'tis a <HI>crown of honour and glory to them;</HI> and their so doing leads to <HI>an eternal crown of glory</HI> in the future World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is their safety and Advantage. All Power in Heaven and Earth is com∣mitted to Christ,</HI> he's <HI>Head over all things to the Church</HI> (Mat. 28. 18. Eph. 1.22.) he <HI>walks in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks</HI> (the Churches) and <HI>holds the stars</HI> (his Ministers) <HI>in his right hand,</HI> Rev. 1. 13, 16. 20. In∣deed he rules and governs <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> according to his Infinite Wise and
<PB N="25" REF="001913_0070_0FB9D6CE0809D898"/>
Soveraign pleasure. Therefore it must needs be for the safety and welfare of <HI>particular Churches</HI> (as well as particular Christians) to obey and honour Christ in all things. He's <HI>King in Zion,</HI> has <HI>a rod of Iron to dash his enemies to pieces, as a Potter's vessel;</HI> therefore it's <HI>wisdom</HI> to <HI>serve him with holy fear;</HI> lest <HI>his anger being kindled against us,</HI> he destroy us for ever, Psal. 2. It's unspeakably dangerous for Persons or Churches, to provoke the Lord Jesus by acting contrary to his Word; for he can <HI>remove the can∣dlestick</HI> out of it's place, <HI>fight against them with the rod of his mouth, come on them</HI> (suddenly) <HI>as a thief, kill them with death,</HI> and <HI>spue them out of his mouth</HI> (as he threatens in case of Im∣penitence and non amendment) Rev. 2. 5, 16, 23. <HI>and</HI> 3. 3, 16. If they provoke him to anger, he can tear them to pieces so that none shall deli∣ver them; he can terribly plague and punish them both in this World and in the next. On the other hand, if
<PB N="26" REF="001913_0071_0FB9D6CFC36CFFB8"/>
they keep the word of Christ's pati∣ence, uphold and maintain his <HI>Doc∣trine, Worship, Discipline</HI> as his word directs; and in all things approve themselves to him; he can and will do for them, all that infinite Wisdom (accompani'd with Infinite Love) sees best for them. What great and <HI>precious Promises</HI> in these Epistles to the <HI>Asian Churches,</HI> are there made to those that are faithful in serving of Christ? Promises very great and precious Indeed. Truly, <HI>godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</HI> 1 Tim. 4. 8. <HI>All things shall work together for good to them that love God, and are cal∣led according to his purpose,</HI> Rom. 8. 28.</P>
<P>And as all particular Churches, should make Gods glory their end and his Word their rule; so should <HI>you</HI> who purpose (God willing) to attend and uphold his Worship and Ordi∣nances <HI>in this place.</HI> To you there∣fore that have been at considerable pains and cost, in building this House
<PB N="27" REF="001913_0072_0FB9D6D9EF9194F0"/>
for the Worship of God, I would say a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Examine your selves concerning what you have done in this matter.</HI> Was it with a true and hearty aim, at the furtherance of Gods glory and the In∣terest of Religion; that you engag'd in this affair, and have been at such pains and expence in it? I would not be mistaken, I do not charge nor chal∣lenge any of you in this matter; how∣ever I think it's not improper, for you to examine your own hearts in this affair. If upon examination you find, that you have regularly and sincerely approv'd your hearts to God in this affair; then be <HI>thankful</HI> that God has enabled you to <HI>expend so much</HI> for his service, and that he has <HI>Inclin'd</HI> you thus to <HI>honour him with your Substance;</HI> and you should humbly hope and trust, that these your gifts and offer∣ings do and shall find acceptance with God thro' Christ. It's a good and great thing, when in matters of this nature persons can truly say, as <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="001913_0073_0FB9D6DAF0EE0040"/>
about his <HI>Preparations</HI> to build the <HI>Temple,</HI> 1 Chron. 29. 17.—<HI>As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things.</HI> And as you should be <HI>thankful,</HI> so far as you have <HI>approv'd your selves to God</HI> in this affair; so you should be <HI>thank∣ful</HI> also for the <HI>success</HI> you have had. The best means can't command suc∣cess, Eccl. 9. 11. <HI>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor favour to men of skill: but time and chance happeneth to all men.</HI> Men might labour in the fire, and spend their strength for very vanity, if God did not smile on and succeed their Endeavours, Psal. 127. 1. <HI>Except the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that build it.</HI> It is therefore owing to kind Providence, not only that persons have <HI>contributed</HI> of their <HI>estates to build this House;</HI> but also that <HI>Materials</HI> have been provi∣ded, <HI>Labourers</HI> and <HI>Artificers preserved and assisted,</HI> and <HI>that the House is thus
<PB N="29" REF="001913_0074_0FB9D6DE326DBE88"/>
finished and perfected. Be thankful</HI> to God for this. But if upon examina∣tion any of you find, that you have acted from <HI>by, sinister</HI> ends, not truly aiming at the furtherance of Gods glory and the Interest of Religion, or not <HI>chiefly</HI> aiming at these things; this calls for your humiliation before God, and flying to the blood of Jesus for pardon.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Approve your selves to God for the future.</HI> Be Christians not only in word, but in deed and in truth, Dont content your selves, with any thing short of true unfeign'd repen∣tance of sin, and faith in Christ Jesus. A <HI>New Meeting-Huuse</HI> (if it were as costly and magnificent as <HI>Solomons Temple</HI>) <HI>New Seats, New Pews,</HI> with∣out a <HI>New Heart;</HI> can never Intitle you to an <HI>habitation</HI> or <HI>seat</HI> in the <HI>New Jerusalem</HI> which is above. <HI>Sabbaths, Meeting-Houses, Ordinances, Ministers;</HI> as to <HI>Man's profit,</HI> are all of them ap∣pointed to this end <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to <HI>bring Souls nearer to God in Christ, and make them
<PB N="30" REF="001913_0075_0FB9D6E0F4686990"/>
more meet for glory.</HI> If you content your selves with externals in Reli∣gion, without having your hearts sin∣cere and upright with God; then you satisfy your selves meerly with <HI>means,</HI> neglecting the <HI>end,</HI> they were appointed for; and thus to do, would be great folly and wickedness indeed. Live therefore as becomes the Chil∣dren of God, the members of Christ, the living Temples of the Holy Spi∣rit; being holy in heart and life, holy in all manner of conversation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Maintain Religion in your Fami∣lies.</HI> Be religious in your own hou∣ses, as well as in the House of God. Maintain a constant course of <HI>secret Prayer,</HI> Mat. 6. 6. <HI>Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</HI> Maintain a constant course of <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> every <HI>morn∣ing and evening.</HI> Resolve as <HI>Joshua</HI> of old, Josh. 24. 15. <HI>As for me and my House we will serve the Lord.</HI> Let
<PB N="31" REF="001913_0076_0FB9D6EBA2F2DE70"/>
the <HI>word of God be read daily</HI> in your Families, Joh. 5. 39. <HI>Search the Scri∣tures,</HI> Josh. 1. 8. <HI>This Book of the Law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein.</HI> Again, set good <HI>examples</HI> before, give fre∣quent wholesome <HI>Instructions</HI> to, maintain good <HI>Government</HI> over, your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants.</HI> Bring them up in the <HI>nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> Eph. 6. 4. Like <HI>Abraham, charge your Children and Household, that they may keep the way of the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18. 19. Do your utmost that those un∣der your family care, may serve God faithfully while you live, and also after you are dead; <HI>that one Genera∣tion may praise Gods works to another,</HI> Psal. 145. 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Keep close to Christ's word as your Rule, in all your publick and Church af∣fairs.</HI> Do all you can, that his holy <HI>Truths, Worship, Discipline</HI> may be up∣held among you. The more hearty
<PB N="32" REF="001913_0077_0FB9D6ED54428218"/>
and diligent you are in this, so much the more you may expect that Christ will bless you. Do what you can to get a <HI>Learned, able, holy and faithful Minister;</HI> even such an one as is de∣scribed, 1 Tim. 3. 1—7. Tit. 1. 6,—9. When God shall set such an one over you, diligently attend on his Mini∣strations. <HI>Esteem him very highly in love for his works sake,</HI> 1 Thes. 5. 13. <HI>obey him and submit to him, as your spiritual watch∣man,</HI> Heb. 13. 17. Afford to him an <HI>honourable maintainance. Honour the Lord with thy substance,</HI> Pro. 3. 9. <HI>So hath the Lord ordained, that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 14. <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things,</HI> Gal 6. 6. Constanly and earnestly <HI>Pray for him,</HI> that God would abundantly assist and succeed him in his work. Christians should make Conscience of thus pray∣ing for their Ministers; the Scrpture frequently Inculcates this duty on them, Eph. 6. 18 19. Col. 4. 3. 1 Thes. 5. 25</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="33" REF="001913_0078_0FB9D6EE954F8548"/>
5. <HI>Live in peace among your selves.</HI> If you want direction in any case, be not backward to advise with <HI>Neigh∣bouring Ministers in the Town;</HI> I be∣lieve they all wish your welfare, that you may have much of the gracious presence and Spirit of Christ with you, &amp; would heartily &amp; readily give you the best advice they could. But the best advice from others, would signify but too little if you should contend among your selves. It's not easy to describe, the woful and grie∣vous fruits of contention: Our Bles∣sed Saviour plainly Intimates, that an <HI>House, City</HI> or <HI>Kingdom, divided a∣gainst it self,</HI> is in danger of <HI>desolati∣on,</HI> Mat. 12. 25. Mark 3. 25 <HI>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another,</HI> Gal. 5. 15. <HI>Where envying and strife is, there is confusion, and every evil work,</HI> Jam. 3. 16. And therefore, <HI>let nothing be done thro' strife or vain glory,</HI> Phil. 2. 3. <HI>only by pride comes contention,</HI> Prov. 13. 10. Therefore subdue <HI>pride
<PB N="34" REF="001913_0079_0FB9D6EFF77B9530"/>
and self-will;</HI> study <HI>self denial,</HI> that <HI>first Lesson</HI> of Christianity, Mat. 16. 24, <HI>Be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you,</HI> 2. Cor 13. 11. In a word, ap∣prove your hearts to Christ in all you do. I can't give you better Counsel than this, <HI>carry it at all times and in all things toward the Lord Jesus;</HI> as considering and firmly believing, that (as our text declares) <HI>he searches the reins and hearts, and will give to every one according to his work.</HI></P>
