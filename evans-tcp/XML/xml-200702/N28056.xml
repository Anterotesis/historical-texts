<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE rightful sovereigns of a fertile soil,</L>
<L>Where copious plenty pays the laborer's toil;</L>
<L>Where growing commerce freights each flowing tide.</L>
<L>With CERES' <HI>bounty,</HI> and with NEPTUNE'S <HI>pride:</HI></L>
<L>Since your brave fires their savage inmates crush'd,</L>
<L>The tocsin silenc'd, and the war-whoop hush'd;</L>
<L>The hostile canvass less'ning from your shore,</L>
<L>The last remains of curst invasion bore;</L>
<L>Dead be the mem'ry of a noble foe;</L>
<L>Where bled the hero, let the olive grow.</L>
<L>Let dove-eyed peace succeed to war's alarms,</L>
<L>Bid savage rancor rust on useless arms;</L>
<L>Her amplest boon to modest merit give,</L>
<L>And guard those arts by which your glories live.</L>
<L>Your approbation's smiles let genius share;</L>
<L>From chilling frosts its budding blossoms spare.</L>
<L>Let not the panders of your taste opposé</L>
<L>The foreign bramble, to the native rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With nothing higher than a noble aim,</L>
<L>Your CANDOR'S all the author dares to claim.</L>
<L>Untaught by rules, he makes his guide the heart,</L>
<L>And modest nature deems the pride of art.</L>
<L>No tragic tale from hist'ry forms his plan;</L>
<L>His facts are passions, and their hist'ry, man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While in the court the supple pander shines,</L>
<L>And cheerless virtue in the dungeon pines;</L>
<L>The elder world's disasters rise to view,</L>
<L>To foil the stubborn virtues of the new:</L>
<L>While these in contrast on the stage appear;</L>
<L>There the proud despot—the firm patriot here;</L>
<L>That rob'd in power—this, arm'd with nature's laws;—</L>
<L>From scenes like these, the bard his moral draws.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, learn, Columbia's sons, to prize your land,</L>
<L>Where no bold tyrant dares to lift his hand;</L>
<L>Where rules a chief, whose power is all your own,</L>
<L>Virtue, his sceptre—and the laws, his throne;</L>
<L>Where, <HI>to obey</HI>—is every freeman's pride,</L>
<L>And, <HI>to rebel</HI>—were worse than suicide!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To captious critics, vers'd in scenic laws,</L>
<L>He dares not trust the merits of his cause.</L>
<L>View then, ye lib'ral, with a candid eye,</L>
<L>Kill not the bird, that first attempts to fly,</L>
<L>But aid his efforts with parental care,</L>
<L>'Till his weak pinions learn to ply the air,</L>
<L>'Till the young pupil dare aloft to rise,</L>
<L>And soar, with bolder flights, his native skies.</L>

More than a daughter's <HI>transports</HI> swell my soul;</L>
<L>The anxious fears that hover round her fate,</L>

<L>Brought up an orphan, mid my father's foes,</L>

<L>And swear it is not worse than on a Monday.</L>
<L>Most freely I acknowledge, Sir, your merit,</L>
<L>And when you've drank your <HI>grog,</HI> I grant you don't want <HI>spirit!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, who are you, far graver than physician?</L>
<L>I know you, now, Sir;—you're a—politician!—</L>
<L>" Great news"—O, what?—The French have not received</L>
<L>" Our Envoys; is the story, Sir, believed—</L>
<L>" O, sir, 'tis true; as friends, they'll never greet ye,</L>
<L>" Unless you break that cursed British Treaty!</L>
<L>" Allowed to arm, too! sir, th' administration,</L>
<L>" Unless resisted, will undo the nation!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I see, sir, you're a Jacobin—"No, in reality</L>
<L>I'm a true friend to Liberty and Equality!</L>

" And tho' of French Directors, 'tis the creed;</L>
<L>" That we, poor <HI>Yankees</HI> are of <HI>spaniel</HI> breed;</L>
<L>" Yet, will our <HI>masters</HI> kindly loose our collars,</L>
<L>" If paid the <HI>"dog tax"</HI> of twelve million dollars!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take my advise, Sirs, and this nonsense drop;</L>
<L>Resume your yard-stick, and attend your shop!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In yonder box, I see a charming maid;—</L>
<L>Not you, Miss Pert, who toss so high your head:</L>
<L>Whilst manners, taste, and sense, and sweetness vie,</L>
<L>To aid the keen destruction of her eye,</L>
<L>What pity she should unstring Cupid's fell-bow,</L>
<L>By showing the <HI>bare bones</HI> of either elbow.</L>
<L>Hide then, O, bide the far too naked arm,</L>
<L>For modest beauty gives a double charm!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such are the trivial faults, absorbed and lost,</L>
<L>Amid the blaze of virtues, that you boast;</L>
<L>If then you will receive this slight essay,</L>
<L>By way of Epilogue, to this our Play;</L>
<L>If what I've said will pass instead of wit,</L>
<L>Your hands applaud me, and your hearts acquit!</L>
