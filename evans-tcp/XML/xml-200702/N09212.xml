<HEAD>The Committee appointed by the Honorable Board the <HI>16</HI>th Instant, beg Leave to make the following Report. W. BRATTLE, per Order.</HEAD>
<P>THE Committee having maturely considered the two petitions to the Honorable Board from the Secretary, <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> together with his Affidavit concerning the Proceedings at Council on the 6th and 7th of <HI>March</HI> last, annexed to a pamphlet published in London, and the several depositions on the subject matter of the said Affidavit, take occasion to make a few observa∣tions from and upon them.</P>
<P>With regard to the said Affidavit several things are observable from it.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> That what is there declared to have been said by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> in Council, is expressed in such a manner as to be generally under∣stood to represent, that antecedent to the unhappy affair of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last▪ there had been a plan formed by people of the best character among us to remove the troops out of the town of Boston, and after that, the Commissioners.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That divers Gentlemen of the Council adopted what had been so said.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> That the Secretary had in his draft expressed what had been said in debate at Council in the terms in the said Affidavit recited; and that this form or draft of his "was allowed (by the Council) strictly to express the truth, but that it would not stand well on the Council Records": whereupon "one of the Gentlemen of the Board prepared an amendment" which "was substituted."</P>
<P>As to the 1st article, the plan therein mentioned was, according to the said Affidavit, intended to effect the removal of the troops, and the removal of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>With regard to the removal of the troops, Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> who men∣tioned the said plan in Council on the 6th of <HI>March</HI> last, declares in his deposition,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 11 in the Appendix.</NOTE> "that he uttered nothing in said Council purport∣ing that any plan had been formed to remove the troops previous
<PB N="3" REF="011737_0005_0F8870D521230840"/>
to their firing on the inhabitants; that he had no idea of a plan formed for the removal of said troops until the day after the shock∣ing scene on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last; and that he then meant to be understood that the disposition of the people to remove the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ops was occasioned by the killing and wounding of divers inhabitants of the town, and by the people's apprehensions that the troops still had an unfriendly design against them."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erving,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pitts</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> in their depositions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 10 Appendix.</NOTE> de∣clare, "that they cannot recollect, neither do they believe, that any thing was said in Council by Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> purporting, that any plan had been formed to remove the troops, previous to their firing on the inhabitants, but that they understood Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean that the people were excited to such a measure by the killing and wounding of some of the inhabitants of the town on the even∣ing immediately preceding."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> and the other members of the Board, then present in Council, have made in substance the same declaration in their respective depositions. Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> the Secretary's deputy, and his assistant <HI>Francis Skinner,</HI> by their depositions,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">No. 5 and 6.</NOTE> taken at the desire of the Secretary, on being asked, declared, that when Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> men∣tioned the plan aforesaid they did not apprehend him to mean a plan concerted previous to the sixth of <HI>March</HI> last; and the Secre∣tary himself has lately declared before the Board, that he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean such a preconcerted plan; and that he never believed any such plan had been formed. All which declara∣tions amount to a satisfactory proof, that what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> said in Council did not convey the idea that a plan had been formed to re∣move the troops previous to their killing a number of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>With regard to a plan for the removal of the Commissioners, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">No. 5 and 6.</NOTE> declares "he heard Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> say, that there was a plan formed to remove the troops from the town, and that they would not stop there but would remove the Commissioners also." <HI>Francis Skinner</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">No. 5 and 6.</NOTE> declares in substance the same: as does also Capt. Caldwell: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No. 3.</NOTE> the two first however say, that they did not apprehend Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> meant a plan concerted previous to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of <HI>March</HI> last. With regard to this circumstance Capt. <HI>Caldwell</HI> is not explicit, and it does not appear that any question was asked him concerning it.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Dalrymple</HI> in the body of his deposition <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">No. 4.</NOTE> says nothing concerning the Commissioners: but after he had signed and delivered it, being asked whether he remembered that Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> said, that part of the plan was to remove the Commissioners out of town? He answered, "that something of that kind was mentioned by some gentleman of the Council during the debates, but he cannot say whe∣ther it was Mr. <HI>Tyler.</HI>"</P>
<P>This is the whole of what is declared on the positive side relative to the Commissioners.—Two of the declarants, viz. Messrs <HI>Cotton</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="011737_0006_0F8870D5E11B20D0"/>
<HI>Skinner</HI> say they were called out divers times while the Council was sitting and in the course of the proceedings and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> infers from it, "that he cannot declare so fully as those who attended with∣out interruption."—Capt. <HI>Caldwell</HI> did not go to the Council till 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> and therefore can∣not judge of what passed at Council so well as those who attended both parts of the day: and Colonel <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> who did attend both parts of the day, did not recollect when he delivered his deposition, that any thing had been said concerning the Commissioners; and his answer, when asked as above, shews he had only a general remem∣brance of something said about the Commissioners; but what it was, does not clearly appear by his answer. It is very likely that what passed between the Lieutenant Governor and several of the Council relative to the protection of the Commissioners, as below mentioned, was the thing that lay in his mind.</P>
<P>It is not doubted that these Declarants understood Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> in the sense they have declared, but it is probable they might misap∣prehend him. It appears by Mr. <HI>Gray</HI>'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 8.</NOTE> and other depositions, that the Lieutenant Governor asked the Board, what protection there would be for the Commissioners if both regiments were order'd to the Castle: and this, very probably, gave the occasion for mention∣ing the Commissioners at all.—Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> upon that question, might express his sentiments on that head; and having so fair an opportu∣nity, might also express his sentiments concerning the Commissioners themselves, and the low estimation in which they are held by people in general, not only here but throughout the continent: and this being intermixed with the subject of the day, viz. the removal of the troops, might occasion what he meant to say relative to the troops only, to be understood by some as relative to them and the Commissioners also It is certain that all the Gentlemen of the Council then pre∣sent, have declared on oath, they have no remembrance that Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> said there was a plan laid for the removal of the Commissio∣ners; and Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> adds to this declaration, that he took particu∣lar notice of what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> did say▪ Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> himself,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 8.</NOTE> upon the most serious recollection, declares on oath, "that the assertion, that he said there was a plan formed to remove the Commissioners, or that it was any part of a plan to remove them, is a gross misrepresentations; and that in his best judgment and firm belief no plan to remove the troops, before their firing on the inhabitants of Boston, or at any time whatever to remove the Commissioners of the Customs, ever was formed or forming by the people, or any number of per∣sons whatever." He further declares "that on the Lieut. Governor's asking in said Council, what will become of the Commissioners, if the troops should be removed, several of the Council gave it as their opinion, that they would be safe, and that they always had been safe: And he verily believes nothing was said to the contrary by any one of the Council present."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> declares,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 8.</NOTE> that upon the Lieut. Governor's asking the said question, he answered, "that the Commissioners would be as
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No. 11.</NOTE>
<PB N="5" REF="011737_0007_0F8870D6A11A80A8"/>
safe without the troops as with them: for that the people would never be so mad as to offer them the least violence when the troops could so easily be recalled for their protection." He further de∣clares "that one Gentleman at the Board immediately seconded him, and assured his Honor of their safety, and added, that he would pawn his life they should receive no injury."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> declares,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 7.</NOTE> "he well remembers that divers of the Council then declared, that in their opinion the Commissioners might continue in town in all safety after the troops were removed thence; and that no one of the Council present discovered an opinion diverse therefrom."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erving</HI> declares,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">No. 10.</NOTE> that "he said at the Board, in the hearing of the Lieut. Governor, on the 6th of <HI>March</HI> last, that in his opinion the Commissioners were safe in town, and never had been in danger; and that he would pawn his life they would remain safe, or words of the same import."</P>
<P>If the foregoing circumstances and declarations be duly remarked, it will appear highly probable that if Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> said any thing about the Commissioners it was misunderstood: and this will appear still more so, if it be further remarked, that, on the contrary supposition, it must have been considered as a reason for the troops remaining in town, if the Commissioners had been supposed to be in danger; as has been observed by several of the deponents; and "the said de∣ponents are persuaded it would have been so considered by the Lieu∣tenant Governor, and the commanding officer of the troops, and consequently tended to defeat the very end, which the several mem∣bers of the Council, and Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> in particular, are represented as aiming at. And they further observe, that had he mentioned it as his opinion, that there was a design of the people to remove the Commissioners, it would have been so utterly contrary to the senti∣ments of these deponents, and they doubt not of every other mem∣ber of the Council present, except himself, that they verily believe it must have produced such a dispute, and opposition, as could not so soon have been forgot."</P>
<P>The second thing observable from the Secretaty's Affidavit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No. 1.</NOTE> is, that divers Gentlemen of the Council, by referring expressly to it, adopted what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had said, viz. That people of the best cha∣racters among us had formed a plan not only to remove the troops but the Commissioners.</P>
<P>In contradiction to this, every Gentleman of the Council then present, deny that they adopted any such declaration. So far are they from adopting what is represented to have been said by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> about a plan for the removal of the Commissioners, that there is not one of them has the least remembrance of any thing said con∣cerning a plan to remove the Commissioners: and therefore they could not refer to it, or in any sense whatever adopt it.—Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="011737_0008_0F8870D7611CB328"/>
and Mr. <HI>Russell</HI> declare,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 9.</NOTE> "that they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> of any intention to remove the Commis∣sioners, so neither could they have adopted such a strange opinion, had it been advanced by any person whatever."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erving,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pitts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">10.</NOTE> declare the same; and add, "that, according to their best remembrance, what was <HI>really</HI> said in Council by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> was not referred to by any other mem∣ber present in such manner, as that it could with the least degree of propriety be affirmed in general terms, as it is in the deposition of the said Mr. <HI>Oliver,</HI> that they adopted what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had said."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> in his deposition recites,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No. 7.</NOTE> "that whereas in Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI>'s aforementioned affidavit, it is asserted that divers members of the Council adopted what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had said, by referring to it, and thereby excusing themselves from enlarging (which assertion plainly imports that divers members of the Council assented to and adopted all that Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> in his affidavit had represented to have been said by Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> relative to a plan formed to remove the Com∣missioners as well as the troops) He the deponent declares, that al∣tho' he had the like apprehensions Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had of the danger of further bloodshed, in case the troops should continue in the town, yet that he never adopted any sentiment, that a plan had been con∣certed for removing the Commissioners (or even the troops by way of compulsion) and, so far at least as relates to the Commissioners, this deponent is fully persuaded, that no member of the Council then present, did adopt the same: inasmuch as he well remembers that divers of them then declared, that in their opinion the Commis∣sioners might continue in town with all safety after the troops were removed thence; and no one of the Council then present discovered an opinion diverse therefrom."</P>
<P>From these depositions and what went before, it appears that the said Gentlemen of the Council were so far from adopting what the Secretary represents to have been said by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> concerning a plan for the removal of the Commissioners, that there is not one of them has the least remembrance of any thing said about such a plan; and therefore they could not refer to it, or in any sense whatever adopt it.</P>
<P>The third thing observable in the Secretary's Affidavit<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">No. 1.</NOTE> is, what he declares about his draft expressing what had been said in debate at Council, that it was allowed by the Council strictly to express the truth, but that it would not stand well on the council records. This declaration represents the Council in a very odious light. It conveys to the world this idea, that they rejected his draft because it was true; and that the truth of it made it unfit to be recorded in the Council books: Whereupon an amendment was substituted. To substitute an amendment, that alters the truth, is to substitute a falsehood; and as the said declaration suggests such a substitution, is implies a charge of falsehood upon the Gentlemen that were present
<PB N="7" REF="011737_0009_0F8870D821152D60"/>
at that Council. But although the Committee apprehend the Se∣cretary did not intend any such charge, yet his words may probably be construed to imply it.</P>
<P>With regard to the said amendment, most of the said Gentlemen have expressed their sentiments in their respective depositions. Five of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 9 and 10.</NOTE> declare, "that the words made use of in the amendment, as recited by the said Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> in his deposition, which were the next morning proposed in Council to be substituted instead of the terms the Secretary had used in the minutes the day before, these deponents then verily thought less liable to be misconstrued; and that by this alteration the true meaning and intent of the several members of the Council, in what they had on the preceeding day said to the Lieutenant Governor, of the disposition of the people, would fully and fairly appear."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> declares,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">No. 7.</NOTE> "that the said amendment was unanimously agreed to by the members of the Council then present, and contains the whole of what, after full debate and mature consideration, was by them adopted, and (together with the advice given to the Lieute∣nant Governor, to use his influence that the troops might be removed) was, as this deponent apprehends, the whole that could regularly be certified by the Secretary, as they were the only Votes of Council that had passed upon that occasion."</P>
<P>The Committee next proceed to consider the Secretary's two Petitions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No. 2 and 12.</NOTE> to the Board, and to make some observations on them.</P>
<P>In one of them he represents, "that his Deposition or Affidavit above-mentioned appears by the tenor of it to have been made meerly to vindicate the Lieutenant-Governor, in desiring that his Majesty's troops might be removed to Castle William, after the fatal catastrophe of the 5th of <HI>March:</HI> he having been called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that affair."—If the Lieutenant-Governor de∣sired the said deposition for his vindication, could he not have been vindicated without the Secretary's traducing the Council, and bring∣ing into question the loyalty of the Town of Boston, or Province? Was it not traducing the Council, to suggest that they rejected his draft because it strictly expressed the truth? And was it not bring∣ing into question the loyalty of the Town or Province, to suggest that a plan had been formed by people of the best characters among us to remove the Troops and Commissioners, and that divers of the Council adopted or allowed it to be true that there was such a plan? Do these suggestions, and the declarations contained in the Secretary's deposition, in which he wholly omits what was said about the safety of the Commissioners, comport with a true relation of the proceed∣ings had in Council on the above-mentioned affair; which relation the Lieutenant-Governor called upon him for?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011737_0010_0F8870D8E1150650"/>The Secretary further represents, that "as holding his commission immediately from the King, who therein expresses his confidence in his fidelity, he could not consider himself as acting in breach of trust, in making said deposition, as he was called upon by the Com∣mander in Chief, who is the King's representative, to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that day."</P>
<P>Though the Secretary holds his commission immediately from the King, the commission constitutes him an officer of the Province, to do the business appertaining to the office of Secretary but does not give the Commander in Chief, notwithstanding he is the King's re∣presentative in the Province, any authority over him.—By virtue of his commission, he is to do the proper business of Secretary. But could it be a part of such business to take minutes at Council of what all or any of the members said in their debates? and after∣wards to give a deposition of it, when called upon by the Comman∣der in Chief? If it was not a part of such business, for what pur∣pose could he want to assist his memory by the said minutes? Could this be any proof of fidelity to the King? or could it not be considered as a breach of trust? Would not such an idea of the business of a Secretary degrade him into the character of a spy and an informer? Would it not be inconsistent with freedom of consul∣tation and debate, and consequently with one of the most essential privileges and rights of Council? and would it not therefore be sub∣versive of every principle, which distinguishes a free government from despotism? But admitting that the Secretary, as the King's officer, is under obligation to take such minutes at Council and reduce them to a deposition if desired by the King's representative (which is utterly denied) yet it appears by one of the Secretary's petitions to the Board, that he officiously, without the privity of any one, took the minutes of what was said in the debates of Council on the 5th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>If the Secretary could think himself authorized to take such mi∣nutes, and give such a deposition, was he not under the obligation of honor, and did not justice require him, to communicate it to the Council before he had compleated and delivered it? Had he done so, the mistakes and partial representations contained in it might have been corrected, and his own honor and justice remained unimpeached.</P>
<P>It has been for some time justly complained of, that depositions, memorials, and every species of information, have been taken and sent to England in a secret manner; and there made use of to re∣present his Majesty's subjects here in an odious light: which has occasioned troops and naval armaments to be sent hither, to the great and unjust annoyance and distress of his Majesty's subjects of this Province. It was therefore the more extraordinary that the Secretary, in the affair of his deposition, should act in the same secret manner, especially as it respected what had been said in Council; about which he could easily have informed himself from the mem∣bers of it, who at the same time had a right to know what he had
<PB N="9" REF="011737_0011_0F8870D9A1240DF8"/>
represented concerning them.—Whatever may have been designed with regard to the operation of this deposition, the manifest ten∣dency of it is to give a most unfavorable, and at the same time a most unjust idea of the people here, and of the Council in particular.</P>
<P>As the said deposition represents the Council in an ill light, it could be no disagreeable present to Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> to whom it was sent by the Lieutenant-Governor, as he informed the Board. His Honor at the same time informed them, that he desired Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> to keep it to himself, unless his conduct with regard to the removing the troops should be faulted, in which case it was to be made use of for his Honor's vindication. Whether it was used or not for that purpose is uncertain: but this is certain, that it has been published in London, annexed with other depositions to a printed pamphlet, intitled "A fair account of the late unhappy disturbance at Boston, in New-England": in which pamphlet and depositions is given a very unfair, and, in all material circumstances, a very false account of what it therein called the late unhappy di∣sturbance. The most material thing aimed at in the said pamphlet, is to obtrude as truth on the public this falsehood, viz. that a plan was here laid for the expulsion of the troops, prior to their firing on and killing a number of the inhabitants of the town: and the principal if not the only deposition that in any measure tends to support such a charge is the Secretary's above mentioned.</P>
<P>This deposition has in some degree answered the purpose of the Pamphlet writer or procurer; and is well calculated <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answer the further purpose of Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> to effect a change in the con∣stitution of the Council, by giving of the last year's Council a very disadvantageous idea; from which will be formed the idea of the present Council, which include the same members as the last.</P>
<P>This deposition has been attended with circumstances that appear in some degree remarkable. It was taken on the same day on which the other depositions (or most of them) annexed to the same pam∣phlet, were taken, viz. the 13th of <HI>March.</HI> They all went (as seems probable) by Mr. Commissioner <HI>Robinson,</HI> who sailed for England the 16th of <HI>March</HI>; and they are all published together in the same pamphlet. Whether these circumstances are casual, or whether they indicate a mutual correspondence and communication between persons here, with regard to the said depositions, there do not appear any sufficient means precisely to determine.</P>
<P>The Secretary further represents "how cautious he was in fram∣ing his deposition; and that he is confident he has been precise in setting down the very words used on the occasion, without adding any construction of his own."</P>
<P>How cautious and precise the Secretary has been, especially in representing what was said about the Commissioners, has fully ap∣peared above, under the article relative to them. He not only gives an imperfect account of what he has represented, but has wholly
<PB N="10" REF="011737_0012_0F8870DA6112DBA0"/>
omitted all the declarations made at Council, relative to the Com∣missioners, that they would be safe, notwithstanding the troops should be removed: which has already sufficiently appeared.</P>
<P>The Secretary goes on to observe, that "the principal matter, wherein the testimony of divers [or rather of all] of said Gentlemen differs from his own, appears to him to be concerning what relates to the Commissioners: with regard to which he apprehends his de∣position is fully supported by the testimony of <HI>disinterested</HI> witnesses then present."</P>
<P>The Secretary here suggests that the Gentlemen of the Council are interested; and therefore that their testimony, wherein it differs from that of his witnesses, whom he represents as disinterested, must be invalidated.</P>
<P>Seven Gentlemen of the Council have given testimony about what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> is represented to have said in Council, concerning the Troops and Commissioners. In this matter, it is evident, they are wholly disinterested. What inducement then could they have to per∣vert the truth? How is their testimony in this matter invalidated?— They may be stiled disinterested witnesses, as properly as those pro∣duced by the Secretary; and much more so than two of them, who act under, and are dependant on the Secretary for their conti∣nuance in office.</P>
<P>The Committee have been thus particular in this matter, that the true state of it might appear; and that thereby the pernicious consequences to the Province, which the Honorable Board appre∣hend the Secretary's deposition may be attended with, may be prevented.</P>
<P>So far as this matter stands related to the Council, it appears that the Secretary's deposition exhibits to the world a very dishonorable and injurious idea of them, by suggesting, that because his draft was allowed strictly to express the truth, it would not stand well on the Council records, and was therefore rejected by the Council. —It appears also that the Secretary, in a secret manner, has taken minutes at Council of what was said by the members of the Council in their debates.—That he has subscribed his name to a paper con∣taining those minutes, and has taken his deposition before <HI>Foster Hutchinson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to the truth of it; also, that the said paper and deposition have been sent by the Lieutenant-Governor to Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> and that they have been since published, with other depo∣sitions, annexed to a printed pamphlet designed to defame the Pro∣vince, with regard to the unhappy affair of the 5th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The conduct of the Secretary in this affair is not only a breach of trust in him, and injurious to the character and honor of the Council, but is destructive of all freedom of speech and debate, and consequently a breach of privilege—the most essential privilege belonging to the Council, or that can belong to a deliberative body.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011737_0013_0F8870DB21134900"/>The Committee therefore are humbly of opinion, that the honor of the Council requires that the Board should come into the follow∣ing Resolutions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Resolved,</HI> That <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Secretary of this Pro∣vince▪ by secretly taking minutes at Council of what was said by the members of Council in their debates, also by signing a paper con∣taining those minutes, and further by giving his deposition to the truth of it, has in each and all those instances acted inconsistent with the duty of his office, and thereby is guilty of a breach of trust.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Resolved,</HI> That the said <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in as much as such proceedings are destructive of all freedom of debate, is guilty of the breach of a most essential privilege of this Board.</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>Resolved,</HI> That an attested copy of this report, and the peti∣tions and depositions to which it relates, be sent to Mr. Agent <HI>Bollan,</HI> in order that he may make the best use of them he can, for the benefit of this Province.</P>

<P N="2">II. RESOLVED unanimously, That the said <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> inasmuch as such proceedings are destructive of all freedom of debate, is guilty of the breach of a most essential privilege of this Board.</P>

<HEAD>Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> <DATE><HI>29</HI> October <HI>1770.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Honorable his Majesty's Council for the said Province,</SALUTE>
Humbly shews <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI></OPENER>
<P>THAT it so happened he had no opportunity to see the Report of your Committee and your Honor's Resolutions thereon until some time after they had passed the Board. That he did im∣mediately thereupon observe to your Honors upon two paragraphs in said Report relating to facts only; and pray an alteration; but as your Honors were then of opinion that the clauses to which he excepted, might as well be set right by his explaining himself in a written Address to the Board, he now begs leave to observe upon the said clauses.</P>
<P>The first of them runs thus— "The Secretary himself has lately declared before the Board that he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean such a preconcerted plan, and that he never believed any such plan had been formed."—Your petitioner upon reading the Report, declared to your Honors that he well remembered that he expressed himself in these terms—"I <HI>do not</HI> believe any <HI>such</HI> plan <HI>ever</HI> had been formed"—and no one Gentleman at the Board would under∣take to say the expression was—"I <HI>never did</HI> believe any <HI>such</HI> plan had been formed"—These several modes of expression he appre∣hends do convey ideas very essentially different. And when your Honors recollect that this was not declared in an address to the Honorable Board, but rather said in conversation with some of the members near whom he sat, it will not be thought strange that the expression can be no better ascertained by the Board.</P>
<P>As to the other part of this declaration, viz. "That he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean <HI>such</HI> a preconcerted plan"—he humbly conceives he must have been misunderstood; because he has been all along studiously careful to give no opinion about it, and has always wished he might never be brought to a public declaration upon that matter. He thinks it very probable such an opinion might be taken up by the Board, from his repeatedly declaring "that he had not in his deposition set forth that Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had said there was a preconcerted plan"; and would by no means be understood even to insinuate that the honorable Board meant to put any unjust colouring upon the declarations made by your petitioner before them. After all, as the thing in question is a matter of mere opinion (and opinions vary as new circumstances arise) he cannot conceive that his opinion upon the force of words can be of much consequence; and inasmuch as the precise words of the said decla∣ration cannot be ascertained by the Board, he humbly moves to the consideration of the honorable Board—Whether the Report aforesaid would not stand as well without the whole clause.</P>
<P>Another paragraph in the Report which your petitioner asked leave to explain himself upon, is that, wherein it is suggested, that
<PB N="13" REF="011737_0015_0F8870DCA10A9288"/>
there might be a mutual correspondence and communication between persons here, with regard to the several depositions published in the same pamphlet.—With regard to which your petitioner can with the greatest solemnity declare, that he never saw or knew any thing concerning either one of the other depositions contained in the said pamphlet, until he saw them in the pamphlet itself a few weeks ago; nor did your petitioner know that his own deposition was ever sent to England, until he saw it in the said pamphlet. He gave his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor a copy of it; nor did he ever give out any other copy of the same. His Honor has declared at the Board that he sent it home, and has given his reasons for so doing.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, your petitioner humbly moves to the conside∣ration of the Board—Whether the Report of the Committee would not stand better without this clause, as well as the other? And prays that your Honors would take such order in the premises as you shall judge meet.</P>
<P>If your Honors should think fit to expunge the said two clauses, your petitioner should ask leave to withdraw this his representation of the matters in question.</P>
<P>As the honorable Board expected him to observe upon these two points only, he will add nothing with regard to the other parts of the Report or the Resolves of the Board in consequence of it, ex∣cept that he is not convinced that he has done any thing inconsistent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of trust: upon which points he explained himself in his petition of the 5th instant. But inasmuch as your Honors have resolved that the proceedings in this business
<Q>be sent to Mr. <HI>Bollan,</HI> in order that he may make the best use thereof he can for the benefit of this Province</Q>
—your petitioner will, in his contracted sphere, chearfully co-operate in every reasonable measure for that end, con∣sistent with the just regard that every honest man ought to have for his own character: And shall as in duty bound ever pray, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The Committee on the Secretary's Petition of the 29th of <HI>October</HI> last have taken the same into Consideration and made the fol∣lowing Observations thereon, which are submitted to the Honorable Board. WM. BRATTLE, by Order.</HEAD>
<P>THE Secretary's last Petition to the honorable Board begins with shewing "that it so happened he had no opportunity to see the report of your Committee, and your Honor's Resolutions thereon, until sometime after they had passed the Board."</P>
<P>On which your Committee would observe, that if the Secretary had thought proper he might have been present, as his Deputy was, at the time the said report was made, and whilst it was under con∣sideration, which would have given him a full knowledge of its con∣tents: But that his knowing it, was in no wise necessary to the Board's passing upon it, as the examination of the evidence on both sides, and in his presence, had been had some time before, agreeable to his petition; and as the said report, besides a summary of the evidence, and one or two incidental circumstances, contained no∣thing but the Committee's observations on that evidence, and the re∣solutions they recommended to the consideration of the Board. They would further observe, that the Board make no secret of any of their proceedings: which however in this case they might have justly done, as the Secretary in a secret manner took minutes of what he represents had been said in Council, and in a secret manner gave his deposition concerning it, and will doubtless in a secret man∣ner, at least without the knowledge of the Board, make represen∣tations on the subject of their proceedings in this affair; which if right or wrong, the Board for that reason, can neither acquiesce in, or detect.</P>
<P>On this occasion the Committee cannot omit taking notice of what his Honor the Lieutenant Governor observed in Council upon the said report, a few days after its acceptance by the Board, viz. That the King had a right to know all that is at any time said or done in the privy Council, considered either as a body or as indivi∣duals; that the calling in question this right would operate to the prejudice of the Province, more than any thing that had been yet done; and that the Secretary did his duty in taking minutes, and conducting as he did.</P>
<P>As to the former part of this declaration, that the King had a right to know what passed at the Privy Council, is granted, and has never been called in question by the Council, either in the re∣port aforesaid, or in any of their proceedings. The King has not only a right to know, but in fact may be said to know whatever passes in Privy Council, even at the time of its passing: His Majesty being a constituent part of every Privy Council, and always present by his representative. There is nothing in the said report, which
<PB N="15" REF="011737_0017_0F8870DE210B07B8"/>
justly be construed to call in question that right. If such a construc∣tion has been given to any part of it, it is forced and unnatural, and which the Board wholly disavow. They do not therefore appre∣hend, that it can in the least degree operate to the prejudice of the Province in any respect whatever; and they humbly rely on his Ma∣jesty's justice and goodness, that no such operation will be the effect of it. If his Honor had pointed out the clause capable of such a construction, they would have received it as an instance of his re∣gard to the Province, and to them.</P>
<P>As to the last part of the declaration, that the Secretary did his duty in taking minutes and conducting as he did, the Committee think it needless to say any thing on this head, as the contrary is fully proved in the report aforesaid.</P>
<P>The Secretary in the said Petition takes exception to two clauses of the said report: the first only of which needs to be noticed. It runs thus, "The Secretary himself has lately declared before the Board, that he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean such a preconcert∣ed plan, and that he never believed any such plan had been formed."</P>
<P>The Secretary divides this clause into two parts, and makes ob∣servations on each. One of the observations is, "that no one Gen∣tleman at the Board would undertake to say, that the expression was precisely as above-mentioned:" and another is, "that he would by no means be understood even to insinuate that the honorable Board meant to put any unjust colouring upon his declarations."—The words, whatever they were, were spoken by the Secretary before the Board, not in conversation with any of the members, but by way of observation on one of the papers in his affair, that had been just read to the Board.</P>
<P>Now although no one Gentleman at the Board would undertake to give the precise words used by the Secretary on that occasion, yet divers of them at the time he first mentioned this matter to the Board, and many of them since have declared, and they do declare, that what he said conveyed to them the same idea as the words made use of in the report, and above quoted, do convey. And not∣withstanding the Secretary insinuates what he says he would by no means insinuate, "that the Board meant to put an unjust colouring on his declarations," yet the Board are wholly clear of that charge, and meant to represent truly what the Secretary said, which they still think they have done, although it may not be in the precise words spoken by him. But it is of so little importance, whether the declaration above quoted was made or not, that the Board would have suffered the Secretary's explanation of himself, to have passed unremarked on, if it had not been attended with an implied reflec∣tion upon their veracity.</P>
<P>The Secretary's Petition mentions further, "that he did not know that his own deposition (containing his secret minutes afore∣said) was ever sent to England until he saw it in the pamphlet" he refers to.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="011737_0018_0F8870DEE10CA1E0"/>Though the Secretary did not (strictly speaking) know, that his said deposition had been sent to England, he could have no sufficient reason to doubt it. At the time he delivered his deposition to the Lieutenant Governor, and also when his Honor applied to him for it, it is probable he was informed for what purpose it was wanted. But admitting he was not, it would be a reflection upon his un∣derstanding, to suppose he could have any doubt, that the deposi∣tion was intended to be sent to England. His saying therefore he did not know it had been sent, is neither a proof, that he did not know it was intended to be sent, nor any justification of himself for delivering it: especially as it was done without giving the Gentle∣men whom it respected, and whose character, as well as that of the Province, was essentially affected thereby, the least notice of it.</P>
<P>The Secretary's Petition further mentions, that "as the Board expected him to observe upon these two points only (contained in the two clauses above refered to) he will add nothing with regard to the other parts of the report, or the resolves of the Board in con∣sequence of it, except that he is not convinced, that he has done any thing inconsistent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of trust."</P>
<P>It is to be observed here, that when the Secretary mentioned to the Board the said two clauses, he excepted to no other part of the report; and when the Board consented he should explain himself by something written upon them; he said he should confine himself to those clauses only: which was acquiesced in. He was not limit∣ed to them by the Board, and the suggestion, that he was so limited, is without foundation.</P>
<P>As to what the Secretary says, that he is not convinced he has done any thing inconsistent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of trust, the Committee would only remark, that altho' the Secretary's general character may be consis∣tent with the character of a man of honor, yet what he has done with regard to his minutes and deposition aforesaid, is in the whole of it inconsistent with that character, and clearly involves in it a breach of trust: all which is sufficiently manifest by the report aforesaid.</P>

<P>THE Lieutenant-Governor having summoned a Council to con∣sider what was proper to be done in the state of disorder and confusion the people are at present in, occasioned by the troops firing upon the inhabitants the last evening, thereby killing three or four persons and wounding others: Previous to the debate, moved, That Lieut. Colonel Dalrymple and Lieut. Colonel Carr, might have notice to attend in Council if they saw fit. They attended accord∣ingly, when the matter was largely discussed in Council; and while this was doing, a Committee of the Town desired to be admitted, who came in and delivered a message, declaring it to be the unani∣mous opinion of the meeting, that nothing can rationally be ex∣pected to restore the peace of the Town, and prevent blood and carnage, but the immediate removal of the troops. The Com∣mittee withdrew while the matter was debated in Council; and Colonel Dalrymple having signified to the Lieutenant Governor, that he was willing the 29th regiment, who had rendered themselves in a special manner obnoxious to the people by the concern they had in this unhappy affair, should be placed at the barracks at the Castle, till he could receive orders from the General; the Lieutenant-Governor acquainted the Committee accordingly, and the Council was adjourned to the afternoon.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor received another mes∣sage from the Town, acquainting him that it was the opinion of the meeting, consisting of near 3000 people, that nothing but a total and immediate removal of the Troops would satisfy the Town; Mr. Adams, one of the Committee, told Colonel Dalrymple, that if he could remove the 29th regiment, he could also remove the 14th, and that it was at his peril if he did not. The Lieutenant-Governor laid the answer of the town before the Board, who, after fully de∣bating the matter, unanimously advised him to pray Colonel Dalrym∣ple to order the Troops down to Castle William.</P>
<P>Previous to this advice, Mr. Tyler had said, "That it was not such people as had formerly pulled down the Lieutenant-Governor's house which conducted the present measures, but that they were people of the best characters among us—men of estates, and men of religion: That they had formed their plan, and that this was a part
<PB N="18" REF="011737_0020_0F8870E0610C5F78"/>
of it to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commis∣sioners: That it was impossible the Troops should remain in town; that the people would come in from the neighbouring towns, and that there would be 10,000 men to effect the removal of the Troops, and that they would probably be destroyed by the people—should it be called rebellion—should it incur the loss of our charter, or be the consequence what it would." Divers other gentlemen adopted what Mr. Tyler had said, by referring expresly to it, and thereupon excusing themselves from enlarging. Mr. Russell of Charlestown and Mr. Dexter of Dedham, confirmed what he said respecting the pre∣sent temper and disposition of the neighbouring towns; every gen∣tleman spoke on the occasion, and unanimously expressed their sense of the necessity of the immediate removal of the Troops from the town, and advised his Honor to pray that Colonel Dalrymple would order the Troops down to Castle William; one gentleman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray.</NOTE> to en∣force it, said, "That the Lieutenant-Governor had asked the advice of the Council, and they had unanimously advised him to a measure; which advice, in his opinion, laid the Lieutenant-Governor under an obligation to act agreeably thereto." Another Gentleman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Capt. Erving.</NOTE> pressed his compliance with greater earnestness, and told him, "That if after this any mischief should ensue, by means of his declining to join with them, the whole blame must fall upon him; but that if he joined with them, and Colonel Dalrymple, after that, should refuse to re∣move the Troops, the blame would then lie at his door." The Lieutenant-Governor all along declared, that he had no authority over the Troops; yet as the Council knew, by what had passed, that upon this desire Colonel Dalrymple would consent to remove them, He, on this emergency, told the Council, he would comply with their advice, and would desire it of him accordingly; and the Colonel declared, "That upon receiving a letter from the Lieutenant-Gover∣nor to that purpose, he would do it." These declarations were made to the towns-committee, and were by them said to be reported to the town, still assembled in town-meeting; whereupon the minds of the people appeared to be quieted.</P>
<P>The Council was adjourned to the next Morning, to see the mi∣nutes made by the Secretary of this day's proceedings set in order, as well as to do some other business that had been assigned over to that time.</P>
<P>The Secretary, in his draft, expressed what had been said in debate, in these terms.—"Divers Gentlemen of the Council informed his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, They were of opinion, that it was the determination of the people to have the Troops removed from the town; and that this was not the sense of the inhabitants of the town of Boston only, but of other towns in the neighbourhood, who stood ready to come in, in order to effect this purpose, be the consequence of it what it may; unless they shall be withdrawn by the command∣ing Officers, which, in their opinion, was the only method to pre∣vent the effusion of blood, and, in all probability, the destruction of
<PB N="19" REF="011737_0021_0F8870E1211085F8"/>
his Majesty's Troops, who must be overpowered by numbers, which would not be less than ten to one.</P>
<P>This form was allowed strictly to express the truth, but that it would not stand well on the Council Records. One of the Gentlemen on the Board prepared an amendment, as in the words following,— "That the people of this, and some of the neighbouring towns, were so exasperated and incensed, on account of the inhuman and barba∣rous destruction of a number of the inhabitants by the Troops, that they apprehended imminent danger of further bloodshed, unless the Troops were forthwith removed from the body of the town, which, in their opinion, was the only method to prevent it."—This amend∣ment was substituted, and the minutes of the whole proceedings set in order and agreed to.</P>

The humble Petition of <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioner while attending his duty yesterday in the Council-Chamber at Cambridge, took notice of a Vote of Council passed in consequence of a deposition signed Andrew Oliver, said to have been published in England relative to the un∣happy affair in Boston the 5th of March last; in which Vote eight
<PB N="20" REF="011737_0022_0F8870E1E10E72B8"/>
Gentlemen of the Board who were of the Council last year were desired to draw up the state of the affair to which the said depo∣sition relates.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner begs leave to represent that the said deposition appears by the tenor of it to have been made merely to vindicate the Lieutenant-Governor in desiring that his Majesty's Troops might be removed to Castle William after the fatal catastrophe of that day, by shewing the necessity he was under of conceding to it, arising from the forcible reasons urged by the Council on that occasion, which reasons may equally serve to justify the Council in advising his Honor to that measure.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner as holding his Commission immediately from the King, who therein expresses his confidence in his fidelity could not consider himself as acting in breach of trust in making said deposition, as he was called upon by the Commander in Chief who is the King's Representative in the Province to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that day, which his Honor has since declared in Council: and your Petitioner could have no appre∣hension of his betraying any of the secrets of Government, as most if not all the proceedings of the day were had in a more public manner than usual, divers of the King's Officers having been then present at the desire of the Governor and Council at their debates and resolu∣tions in Council.</P>

<P>BENJAMIN CALDWELL, of lawful age, deposeth, That on the 6th March last in the afternoon about four o'clock, he went to the Council by desire of Col. Dalrymple, and in the debates there, heard Mr. Tyler say to the following effect—That the people in the town were so exasperated against the King's Troops, that nothing but a total and immediate removal of them would be satisfactory—that there was then in town meeting upwards of 3000 people—that there would be before next evening ten thousand more from the country—that the Troops could by no means remain in town with any degree of safety, and if they were not immediately removed, the people would take to their arms and destroy them, should it be deemed Rebellion or occasion the loss of the Charter— that a plan was fixed to have them and the Commissioners removed, and that the plan was not formed by such people as formerly destroy∣ed the Lieutenant-Governor's house, but by persons of the first con∣sequence and estates in the country and men of religion. The seve∣ral other Gentlemen of the Council adopted what Mr. Tyler had said and excused themselves from enlarging. And further saith not.</P>

<P>WILLIAM DALRYMPLE, of lawful age, deposeth, That being required, he attended the Council on the 6th March last. On his arrival in the Council room, the Lieut. Governor informed him, that he was sent for in consequence of the disturbances then prevailing in the town, and desired the members of the Council to recapitulate what they had said on that subject before his, the de∣ponent's, arrival, if they thought proper.—Mr. Tyler arose and spoke to the following purpose. That the people in general were resolved to have the Troops removed, without which they would not be satisfied—that failing of other means, they were determined to effect their removal by force, let the act be deemed rebellion or otherwise—that those who were now so resolved were not such a mean mob as had attack'd the Lieut. Governor's house, but were people of the best characters and fortunes in the Province, and men of religion—He afterwards added, that the present disturbances were not to be cosidered as casual, but part of a plan that the people were fixed in the execution of. He concluded with declaring, that the same sentiments were adopted in the towns adjacent—that be∣fore next morning 10,000 men would be assembled on the Common of Boston—He then appealed to two members of the, Council just arrived from different parts of the country, who the deponent be∣lieves

<P>JOHN COTTON, of lawful age, testifies, that on the sixth day of March 1770, his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor summoned a Council, to consider what was proper to be done in consequence of the great confusion the people of the town were in, occasioned by a number of Soldiers firing on the inhabitants, killing some and wounding others the evening before. That the Deponent being in Council while this matter was debating, heard the Honorable Royall Tyler, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> say that the people who conducted affairs at this time, were not such kind of people as Magnis Mode and others who were concerned in pulling down the Lieutenant-Governor's house, but that they were people of good characters, men of estates and religion, and men who prayed over what they did; that there was a plan formed to remove the Troops from the town, and that they would not stop there, but would remove the Commissioners also, that it was impossible the Troops should continue in the town, that 10,000 men would come from the neighbouring towns to assist in removing them, that this would be done, should it be called Rebel∣lion, incur the loss of the Charter, or let the consequence be what it may. The Deponent says further, that being several times occa∣sionally called out while the Council was sitting, he cannot declare so fully as those who attended without interruption.</P>

<P>WHEREAS in one of the publick news-papers for the last week printed in Boston, there appeared an Affidavit signed <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> taken before Foster Hutchinson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Justice of the Peace, and said to be extracted from a pamphlet lately published in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy disturbance at Boston in New-England," in which affidavit, after mention made of a Council convened by order of the Lieutenant Governor and held on the fifth (in reality on the sixth) day of March last (it being the next day after a number of persons had been killed and wounded by the troops firing upon them) it is, among other things, declared that Mr. Tyler, in Council, said <HI>that they, the people, had formed their plan and that this was apart of it, to remove the Troops out of Town and after that the Commissioners, and that what Mr. Tyler had said was adopted by divers members of the Council, who, by referring to what Mr. Tyler had said, excused themselves from enlarging.</HI> And whereas the several members of the Council Board, who were present in Council on the sixth and seventh days of March last, have been called upon to relate to that Board what foundation there was for such a representation as was made in the affidavit afore∣mentioned, this deponent, who was one of the eight Councellors then present, testifies and says, that although he remembers that Mr. Tyler, on that unhappy occasion, did in strong terms express his apprehension of imminent danger of further bloodshed in case the troops should continue in the town (which appeared to this
<PB N="25" REF="011737_0027_0F8870E5A10673D8"/>
deponent to be likewise the apprehension of every other member of the Council then present) and that mention was made by Mr. Tyler of a plan formed to remove the troops, yet this deponent cannot recol∣lect that Mr. Tyler asserted that it was a part of the plan to remove the Commissioners also, as set forth in said affidavit: And whereas the mention made by Mr. Tyler of a plan that had been formed, (considering that the interval of time between those outrages and Mr. Tyler's narration was scarce sufficient wherein to form such a plan and the knowledge of it to reach Mr. Tyler) may by some be understood to refer to a plan formed before those outrages were committed, this deponent testifies that nothing said by Mr. Tyler, in his hearing, did convey to him any idea of such a plan formed pre∣vious to those outrages; and how incautiously and madly so ever some individuals highly incensed, might have expressed themselves, and what apprehensions so ever Mr. Tyler (thro' misinformation or other∣wise) might then have of a plan formed for removing the troops from the town, in any other way than by prevailing with their officers to remove them, this deponent verily believes that no com∣bination had ever been formed, or plan concerted for the purpose of removing the troops, either in the town of Boston or elsewhere; having never heard it suggested by any other person then Mr. Tyler either then or at any time since: And whereas in the aforementioned affidavit it is asserted that divers members of the Council adopted what Mr. Tyler had said by referring to it, and thereby excusing themselves from enlarging; (which assertion plainly imports that divers members of the Council assented to and adopted all that Mr. Oliver in his affidavit had represented to have been said by Mr. Tyler relative to a plan formed to remove the Commissioners as well as the Troops) this Deponent declares that altho' he had the like apprehensions as Mr. Tyler had of the danger of further blood∣shed in case the troops should continue in the town; yet that he never adopted any sentiment that a plan had been concerted for re∣moving the Commissioners, or even the troops in way of compul∣sion; and, so far at least, as relates to the Commissioners, this de∣ponent is fully persuaded that no member of the Council then pre∣sent did adopt the same, inasmuch as he well remembers that divers of them then declared that in their opinion the Commissioners might continue in town with all safety after the troops were re∣moved thence: and no one of the Council then present discovered an opinion diverse therefrom.</P>
<P>And this deponent further says, that the amendment made of the minutes of Council which had before been taken by the Secretary (as said amendment is recited in his affidavit, and which was unani∣mously agreed to by the members of Council then present) contains the whole of what, after full debate and mature consideration had, was by them adopted, and (together with the advice given to the Lieutenant-Governor, to use his influence that the troops might be removed) was, as this deponent apprehends, the whole that could regularly be certified by the proper officer of that Board, as they were the only Votes of Council that had pass'd upon that occasion.</P>

<P>HARRISON GRAY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the members of the present and of the last year's Council, having seen and read a deposition. signed Andrew Oliver, annexed to a pamphlet printed in London, re∣lative to the advice given by the Council to his Honor the Lieutenant Governor on the 6th of March last, when they advised his Honor to desire Colonel Dalrymple to remove the troops from Boston to Castle William—deposes and says, that he being present at that Council, after the most careful recollection, he has not the least remembrance that Mr. Tyler said in the debate there was a plan laid for the re∣moval of the Commissioners, tho' he took particular notice of what he did say. And this deponent further says, that upon the Lieut. Governor's asking the Board, what protection there would be for the Commissioners if both regiments were ordered to the Castle, or words of the same import, he the deponent answered, that they would be as safe without them, as with them; for that the people would never be so mad as to offer them the least violence, when the troops could be so easily recalled for their protection, or words im∣porting the same sense. One Gentleman at the Board immediately seconded the deponent and assured his Honor of their safety, and added, that he would pawn his life that they should receive no in∣jury, or words that conveyed the same sense. The deponent fur∣ther says, that when Mr. Tyler said, "the people of the best cha∣racters among us, men of estates, and men of religion, had formed a plan to remove the troops out of Boston, should it be called re∣bellion, should it incur the loss of the charter, or be the consequence what it would," he the deponent did not understand that Mr. Tyler meant that such a plan was laid previous to the killing of the inha∣bitants by the soldiery, but that it was in consequence of the horri∣ble transactions of the evening of the fifth of March. And further that Mr. Tyler rather expressed his opinion of the measures the people (being thus exasperated) would take, than his approbation of such measures.</P>

<P>THOMAS HUBBARD and JAMES RUSSELL, Esq'rs. mem∣bers of his Majesty's Council for the Province of the Massa∣chusetts-Bay, and who were such the last year, do make solemn oath, and each speaking for himself in the fear of God, severally say, that they were by order of his Honor Thomas Hutchinson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieutenant-Governor of said Province, notified to attend in Council on Tuesday the sixth day of March last, being the day after the Troops then in the town of Boston had fired upon the inhabi∣tants of the said town, thereby killing and wounding divers persons, which had occasioned much disorder and confusion, and had greatly exasperated the people, not only of that but of some other towns that bad been made acquainted with the melancholy affair.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="011737_0029_0F8870E721014B88"/>That these Deponents, when in Council, told the Lieutenant- Governor, in the following words, or in words of the like import, "That the resentment of the people in Boston, and some of the adja∣cent towns was so raised, on account of the destruction of the lives of their countrymen by the Troops, who were also in such temper with respect to the inhabitants, that there was reason to apprehend, if the Troops were not removed from the town, there would be further bloodshed, and the people in the vicinity would in their opinion, come in to assist the inhabitants of the town in removing the Troops, unless they should be withdrawn by the commanding Officer."</P>
<P>This disposition of the people towards the Troops, these deponents say, was, as they did then, and do now verily believe, occasioned by the destruction of their countrymen as aforesaid; and these depo∣nents then intended that the Lieutenant-Governor should understand them to mean that the people still conceived of the Troops as having a hostile design against them: And these deponents animated with a sincere desire to preserve, as well the lives of the King's Troops, as of the inhabitants, did thereupon express their sense of the necessity of the immediate removal of the Troops, and pressed the matter with great earnestness on the Lieutenant-Governor.</P>
<P>These Deponents further say, they have very lately seen a depo∣sition signed Andrew Oliver, and dated, as they suppose, thro' a mistake, March 5, 1770, respecting the proceedings of said Council on the 6th and 7th of March last, which is printed in the Appendix to a Pamphlet lately published in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy Disturbance at Boston in New-England," which deposition was taken before Foster Hutchinson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of his Ma∣jesty's Justices for the County of Suffolk, (without notice thereof previously given to these Deponents) in which deposition it is as∣serted, that Mr. Tyler, one of the eight members of the Council then present, among other things said, "that they (the people) had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commissioners," Now these Depo∣nents declare, that they cannot recollect that any thing was said in Council by Mr. Tyler purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants (in which sense these Deponents apprehend the deposition of Mr. Oliver aforesaid may be taken; but these Deponents understood Mr.Tyler to mean, that the people were excited to such a measure by the kil∣ling and wounding of some of the inhabitants of the town on the evening following the 5th of March. Nor do these Deponents re∣member that he mentioned any thing of a design to remove the Commissioners; and these Deponents apprehend it altogether im∣probable that he should have delivered such an opinion, not only as it cannot be presumed they should both have forgot it, but as it must have been, as they conceive improved as an argument against the removal of the Troops, notwithstanding all that had been said of the necessity of such a removal, if the Commissioners had been sup∣posed to be in danger: and such an argument, had it been used, these deponents are persuaded, would have had great weight with the
<PB N="28" REF="011737_0030_0F8870E7E0FE2AC0"/>
Lieutenant-Governor, and the commanding officer of the Troops; and consequently have tended to defeat the very end Mr. Tyler and they are represented as aiming at. Besides, it would have been so utterly contrary to the sentiments of these Deponents, that had Mr. Tyler advanced such an opinion they have no doubt it must have produced such a dispute and opposition as could not have been for∣got by any one present And these Deponents say, as they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. Tyler of any intention to remove the Commissioners, so neither could they have adopted such a strange opinion, had it been advanced by any person whatever.</P>
<P>These deponents further declare, that the words made use of in the amendment as recited by Mr. Oliver in his deposition aforesaid, which were the next morning proposed in Council to be substituted instead of the terms the Secretary had used in the minutes of Coun∣cil taken the day before, these deponents then verily thought less liable to be misconstrued, and that by this alteration the true mean∣ing and intent of the several members of the Council, in what they had the day before said to the Lieutenant-Governor of the dispo∣sition of the people, would fully and fairly appear.</P>
<P>And furthermore, these deponents declare, that, in their best judgement and firm belief, there was no intention of the people, or of the inhabitants of Boston, or of any other town of the Province, to remove the Troops, before the evening following the fifth of March last, nor at any time whatsoever to remove the Commissioners.</P>

<P>That several members of the Council convened on said occasion expressed their minds to the Lieutenant-Governor, in terms import∣ing, that the resentment of the people in Boston, and some of the adjacent towns, was so raised on account of the destruction of the lives of their countrymen by the troops, who were also in such temper with respect to the inhabitants, that there was reason to ap∣prehend, if the troops were not removed from the town, there would be further bloodshed; and that the people in the vicinity

would, in their opinion, come in to assist the inhabitants of the town in removing the Troops, unless they should be withdrawn by the commanding officer. This disposition of the people towards the Troops, these deponents say, was, as they did then, and do now verily believe, occasioned by the destruction of their countrymen as aforesaid, and an apprehension that the Troops had still a hostile design against them; and these deponents, animated with a sincere desire to preserve as well the lives of the King's Troops as of the inhabitants, did with much earnestness express to the Lieutenant-Governor their sense of the necessity of the immediate removal of the Troops from the town.</P>
<P>These deponents further say, they have very lately seen a deposition signed Andrew Oliver, and dated, as they suppose thro' a mistake, March 5th, 1770, respecting the proceedings of said Council on the sixth and seventh of March last, which is printed in the Appendix to a Pamphlet lately published in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy disturbance at Boston in New-England," and was taken before Foster Hutchinson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> without notice thereof pre∣viously given to these deponents, in which deposition it is asserted, that Mr. Tyler, one of the eight members of the Council then pre∣sent, among other things, said, "that they (the people) had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it, to remove the troops out of town, and after that the Commissioners." Now these deponents declare, that they cannot recollect, neither do they believe that any thing was said in Council by Mr. Tyler, purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants, in which sense these deponents apprehend the de∣position of the said Mr. Oliver will generally be taken; but these deponents understood Mr. Tyler to mean, that the people were ex∣cited to such a measure by the killing and wounding of some of the inhabitants of the town, on the evening immediately preceeding. Nor do these deponents remember that he mentioned any thing of a design to remove the Commissioners; and these deponents appre∣hend it altogether improbable that he should have delivered such an opinion, as they conceive it must have been considered as a reason for the Troops remaining in town, if the Commissioners had been supposed to be in danger; and these deponents are persuaded it would have been so considered by the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commanding Officer of the Troops, and consequently have tended to defeat the very end which the several members of the Council, and Mr. Tyler in particular, are represented as aiming at. And had he mentioned it as his opinion, that there was a design of the peo∣ple to remove the Commissioners, it would have been so utterly con∣trary to the sentiments of these deponents, and they doubt not of every other member of the Council present, except himself, that these deponents verily believe it must have produced such a dispute and opposition as could not so soon have been forgot. And these de∣ponents say, as they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. Tyler of any intention to remove the Commissioners, so neither could they have adopted such a strange opinion, had it been advanced
<PB N="30" REF="011737_0032_0F8870E960FDD4D0"/>
by any person whatever. And according to the best remembrance of these deponents, what was really said in Council by Mr. Tyler was not referred to by any other members present, in such manner as that it could with the least degree of propriety be affirmed in general terms, as it is in the deposition of the said Mr. Oliver, that they adopted what Mr. Tyler had said.</P>
<P>These deponents further declare, that the words made use of in the amendment, as recited by the said Mr. Oliver in his said depo∣sition, which were the next morning proposed in Council to be sub∣stituted instead of the terms the Secretary had used in the minutes of Council taken the day before; these deponents then verliy thought less liable to be misconstrued; and that by this alteration the true meaning and intent of the several members of the Council in what they had on the preceeding day said to the Lieutenant-Governor, of the disposition of the people, would fully and fairly appear.</P>
<P>And these deponents further declare, that if any other person or persons have represented these deponents as saying in said Council, or at any other time, that there was an intention of the people to effect by force the removal of the Troops, before their firing on the inhabitants as aforesaid, or any purpose, either prior or posterior to the fifth of March last, of removing the Commissioners of the Customs, or words of the like import, or as adopting such senti∣ments, after having been advanced by any person whatever, such representation is not only contrary to fact, but utterly void of all foundation.</P>
<P>And furthermore these deponents declare, that, in their best judg∣ment and firm belief, no such intention or purpose of the people, or of the inhabitants of the town of Boston, or of any other town or place in the Province, ever existed, either with respect to the Troops or the Commmissioners.</P>

signed Andrew Oliver, dated March the 5th, 1770, respecting the proceedings of said Council in which deposition (the taking whereof was unknown to this deponent) it is asserted that the de∣ponent, among other things, said that "people of the best characters among us, men of estates, and men of religion, had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it, to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commissioners." Now this deponent de∣clares, that he uttered nothing in said Council purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants as aforesaid; in which sense he apprehends that the said Mr. Oliver designed his deposition should be taken; and the deponent then meant to be understood, that the disposition of the people to remove the Troops was occasioned by the killing and wounding of divers inhabitants of the town, and from the peo∣ple's apprehension that the Troops still had an unfriendly design against them.—Nor had this deponent any idea of a plan formed for the removal of said Troops until the day after the shocking scene on the evening of the fifth of March last. And this depo∣nent upon the most serious recollection further declares, that the assertion of the said Mr. Oliver, that this deponent said there was a plan formed to remove the Commissioners, or that it was any part of such a plan to remove them, is a gross misrepresentation.</P>
<P>And this deponent further says, that he well remembers that on the Lieutenant-Governor's asking in said Council, what will become of the Commissioners if the Troops should be removed; several of the Council gave it as their opinion, that they would be safe; and that they always had been safe; and this deponent verily believes, no∣thing was said to the contrary by any one of the Council present.</P>
<P>And this deponent further says, that in his best judgment and firm belief, no plan to remove the Troops before their firing on the inhabitants of Boston, or at any time whatsoever to remove the Commissioners of the Customs ever was formed, or forming by the people, or any number of persons whatever. And further this deponent saith not.</P>

<SALUTE>To the Honorable his Majesty's Council for the Province abovesaid,</SALUTE>
Humbly sheweth <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI></OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioner observes in the Votes of Council re∣ferred to in his Petition preferred the 5th instant to this honorable Board as a branch of the Legislature, that he is charged with <HI>representing</HI> divers Gentlemen of the Council of the last year, in a certain deposition published in England,
<Q>as having made such a declaration to his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, respecting a plan formed by the people to remove the King's Troops and the Commissioners <HI>of the Customs</HI> from the town of Boston, as was likely to be attended with the most pernicious consequences to this Province.</Q></P>
<P>Your Petitioner hereupon begs leave to observe to your Honors that he hath represented Mr. Tyler <HI>only,</HI> as having made a declara∣tion of that kind; and divers other Gentlemen as only
<Q>adopting what Mr. Tyler had said, by referring expressly to it, and there∣upon excusing themselves from enlarging.</Q></P>
<P>Before your Petitioner attempts to explain his said deposition, he hopes he may without offence be allowed to take notice, that he hath not used the words—Commissioners <HI>of the Customs,</HI> as is ex∣pressed in the Vote of Council, but—the Commissioners <HI>only:</HI> and he the rather takes notice of this variation, because it brings fresh to his mind, how cautious he was in framing his deposition. He perfectly remembers that Mr. Tyler mentioned the Commissioners, but not the Commissioners <HI>of the Customs;</HI> your Petitioner therefore did not insert those descriptive words in his deposition.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner apprehends that the several positive witnesses which he hath produced to prove that Mr. Tyler said the words abovementioned, must be considered as undoubted evidence of the fact: but he never once pretended to say that divers other Gentle∣men made such a declaration, otherwise than by adopting what Mr. Tyler had said, i. e. by referring to it and thereupon desiring to be excused from enlarging.</P>
<P>He thinks he has not misunderstood the meaning of the word <HI>adopt.</HI> The word, as he conceives, in its primary signification intends—a person's taking another's child as his own. From hence, when one relates a story or an historical account of facts upon the credit of another, without shewing any doubt of the truth of them, he is said to adopt the story or account related by him; and in like manner he may be said to adopt the opinion of another, when he expressly refers to it without betraying a doubt about it: he does so in a more especial manner, when he refers to such opinion for his own government, or the government of others in point of practice. In this sense your Petitioner understood the word <HI>adopt</HI>: Had he said that divers other Gentlemen <HI>confirmed</HI> what Mr. Tyler had said, it might have been then alledged, that they were charged with vouching for the truth of facts themselves, whereas the
<PB N="33" REF="011737_0035_0F8870EBA0F800A0"/>
word <HI>adopt</HI> strictly and literally implies no more than that they sup¦posed the truth of facts on the credit of the relator; nor did your Petitioner ever intend any thing more by it; and that upon supposi∣tion of the truth of the facts related, they might found their opinion.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore hopes his deposition cannot be consi∣dered as containing any unjust charge against any of the Gentlemen of the Council who referred to what had been said by another Gentleman as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Nor did your Petitioner ever apprehend that the good people of the Province in general were at all chargeable with forming any unjustifiable plan. If the plan said to have been formed to remove the Troops and Commissioners was to have been executed in a legal and constitutional way, they would doubtless be ready to avow it themselves. If it was to have been executed by violence, such plans are usually formed by a few; and if it was formed after the evening of the 5th and before noon of the 6th of March, it may well be supposed that there were very few concerned in the forming of it.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner never intended to convey any idea of the plan's being formed prior to the 6th of March rather than after it: He is confident that he has been precise in setting down the very words used on the occasion, without adding any construction of his own.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner will not presume to make any other observations on the depositions of the Gentlemen of the Council who were con∣cerned in this business, save that they are generally negative testi∣monies, and some of them principally argumentative. The principal matter wherein the testimony of divers of said Gentlemen differs from that of your Petitioner, appears to him to be concerning what relates to the Commissioners; with regard to which, he apprehends, his deposition is fully supported by the testimony of disinterested witnesses then present.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner drew up a memorandum of that day's proceedings, without the privity of any one, merely to assist his memory in future. When he was afterwards called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor for his testimony concerning those matters, he had this memorandum or narrative copied without any alteration. It does not appear to have had any influence on the measures of government at home, as the proceedings relative to the Troops are not so much as men∣tioned in the Resolves of the King in Council in July last: Nor has he heard of any private letter from London mentioning the said deposition as like to be attended with any pernicious consequences. He therefore prays that for the reasons herein mentioned, and those in his Petition of the 5th instant, this honorable Board will, in justice to his character, order the same, together with the depositions he has adduced, to be lodged on the files of this Court, and take such further order for preventing any prejudice to his character on this occasion, as in equity shall seem meet. And your Petitioner shall, as in duty bound, ever pray, &amp;c.</P>
