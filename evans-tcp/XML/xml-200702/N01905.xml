<P>TIs probable that the Text now Read, may seem <HI>Remote</HI> from the Occa∣sion upon which we are now assembled. But before the Sermon is done, you will see that the <HI>Preacher seeks out Agreeable Words,</HI> &amp; the Occasion will be abundantly suited in it. But I am first of all, to do the office of an <HI>Heral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002253_0004_0FDADB45C5E8CD58"/>
unto the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> among you. Give Attention, O People of God, Give Attention. Your Glorious KING is now to be <HI>Proclaimed</HI> among you; One of His most Illustrious Titles, is to be more particularly Asserted and Publish∣ed C▪ Congregation while the Sermon is going on, The <HI>Lord thy God is with thee, and the shout of a King is in the midst of thee.</HI></P>
<P>For the PSALM that is now to yield us a Text for our Intention, may we not find some <HI>Occasion</HI> in the Removal of the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> and its Translation up to <HI>Zion</HI> at which the People appeared in a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Confluence, and with much Solemnity? The People are Exhorted hereupon, to practice the most <HI>Substan∣tial,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gether with their <HI>Ceremonial</HI> PIETY. But might not the <HI>Ascension</HI> of our SAVIOUR into the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> be represented in that Solemni∣ty, and be here described and predict∣ed? We are credibly informed, That the <HI>Psalm</HI> now before us, was that which it was the ancient Custome of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to Sing still on, <HI>The First Day of the Week.</HI> Doubtless, Their Wise
<PB N="3" REF="002253_0005_0FDADB0A4A82AC80"/>
Men discerned here, a Prophecy of a CHRIST, who on the <HI>First Day of the Week,</HI> began to <HI>Ascend</HI> the <HI>Throne of his Glory.</HI> Yea, Why should not the <HI>Coming</HI> of our SAVIOUR <HI>in His Kingdom,</HI> have the Spirit of Prophecy here pointng at it? The Period, when the <HI>King of Glory,</HI> shall <HI>make His Entry,</HI> and His Church here is to give him a Reception due to such a <HI>King of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>It is most certainly, our SAVIOUR, who is here celebrated as the <HI>King of Glory.</HI> That co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mptible creature, who lately assumed this Denomination, ought forever to have his memory treated no otherwise than that of a <HI>Prophane</HI> and <HI>Wicked Prince,</HI> and the most <HI>Vain glorious worm</HI> in the World. No. <HI>It shall be Thy Glory, O our SAVI∣OƲR, to be,</HI> The King of Glory! <HI>A Glory tis, which Thou wilt not give to another.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a Demand, <HI>Lift up your Heads, ye Gates, and be ye Lift up, ye Everla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Doors, and the King of Glory shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in.</HI> The <HI>Gates</HI> of <HI>Zion,</HI> were dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of the <HI>Portcullis</HI> fashion, and were to be <HI>opened</HI> by <HI>Lifting up.</HI> At the Execution
<PB N="4" REF="002253_0006_0FDADB4A1B14E450"/>
of this Demand, for the Entry of the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> into <HI>Zion,</HI> there is a <HI>Dialogue.</HI> It is both Enquired, and Answered <HI>Who is this King of Glory?</HI> Twas provided, I suppose, to be <HI>Alternately Sung,</HI> by the Officers placed at the <HI>Gates.</HI> I allow a Type of our SAVIOUR<HI>'s</HI> being <HI>Re∣ceived up to Glory,</HI> in this Transaction. But I behold, a <HI>Repetition</HI> of the matter. This inclines me to an Apprehension; That here is demanded for our SAVI∣OUR, a Reception with his People: at His Two several <HI>Comings</HI> into the World. Whatever may be meant, by the <HI>Gates</HI> and the <HI>Everlasting Doors,</HI> which are to be <HI>Opened</HI> for His Recep∣tion, besure, O People of God, our <HI>Hearts</HI> are intended; The <HI>Gates</HI> and the <HI>Everlasting Doors</HI> of our Souls, are to be <HI>Opened</HI> unto Him. The <HI>Dialogue</HI> here managed on this Occasion, Enquir∣ing and Answering, <HI>Who is this King of Glory?</HI> between whomsoever tis carried on, we may well apprehend, the <HI>Angels</HI> of God concerned in it; The <HI>Angels</HI> who are the admiring Spectators of his <HI>Glory.</HI> Tis Remarkable, That in the first Account of this Glorious King, <HI>He
<PB N="5" REF="002253_0007_0FDADB079C9AF7B0"/>
is mighty in Battel.</HI> In the Second, there is nothing of any <HI>Battle.</HI> Because, at the Second Appearance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our SAVI∣OUR, the <HI>Conflicts</HI> about His <HI>Kingdom</HI> are over; nor do they <HI>Learn War any more.</HI> However, in the Second Account of this <HI>Glorious King,</HI> He is called, <HI>The Lord of Hosts</HI>: which is in a more Ex∣tensive Sense, than that wherein <HI>Hosts</HI> Armed for <HI>War,</HI> are spoken of.</P>
<P>And of this, my DOCTRINE, is to introduce a brief Treatise for your Entertainment.</P>
<Q>Our SAVIOƲR even the Blessed Jesus, is that Glorious King, whom the Glory of being, the LORD of HOSTS, does belong unto.</Q>
<P>When we behold our SAVIOUR, we behold, <HI>The King of Glory</HI>: we <HI>Behold the King in His Beauty,</HI> and see the most Glorious thing in the <HI>Land that is afar off.</HI> But with Souls full of won∣derments, we cannot but raise the Question, <HI>Who is this King of Glory</HI>? There is but one part of the Reply to be made unto the Question, in this Ac∣Account,
<PB N="6" REF="002253_0008_0FDADB4B87EA0428"/>
that is now given of Him; <HI>The Lord of Hosts He is the King of Glory.</HI> When we have had, <HI>The Lord of Hosts,</HI> in the best Veiw, that we can give or get of Him, it may be said, <HI>How little a portion is heard of Him</HI>! This Title, <HI>The LORD of HOSTS,</HI> I find many more then Threescore Times given to our SAVIOUR in this <HI>Word of CHRIST.</HI> What <HI>Precious Thoughts</HI> of Him will it afford unto us!</P>
<P N="1">I. When our SAVIOUR is called <HI>The LORD of Hosts,</HI> you are aware, that the Name of JEHOVAH, is ascrib∣ed unto Him. The Denomination in the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iginal is, <HI>JEHOVAH Zabaoth.</HI> Yea, Even, in the Greek of our New-Testament so much of the Hebrew Ap∣pellation is retained, that we read J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. V.4. concerning, <HI>The Lord of Sabaoth.</HI> It is most certain, That the Name, JEHOVAH, does belong unto our SA∣VIOUR. That Appellation, <HI>Which is, and which was, and which is to come,</HI> is but the Translation of the Name JEHO∣VAH. The Prophet was an Eye-wit∣ness to the <HI>Seraphim</HI>; Isa. VI.3. who <HI>Cried One to Another, and said, Holy,
<PB N="7" REF="002253_0009_0FDAC974988D00F0"/>
Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Host</HI>; or JE∣HOVAH <HI>Sabaoth.</HI> Now, a very sure Interpeter has assured us; Joh. XII.41. <HI>These things said Esaias, when He saw His Glory, and spake of Him.</HI> Yea, Dont we find in the Ancient Prophecies, the crucifixion of the <HI>Messiah</HI> foretold in those Terms, JEHOVAH Sais, <HI>They pierced me</HI>? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is not the <HI>Messiah</HI> Styled, <HI>JEHOVAH our Righteousness</HI>! It is most certain, That JEHOVAH the God of <HI>Israel, was the Supreme</HI> God, And it is most Certain, That our SA∣VIOUR was the very same with JE∣HOVAH, the God of <HI>Israel</HI> JEHO∣VAH is an <HI>Incommunicable Name.</HI> The <HI>Name</HI> is peculiar to the <HI>most High God.</HI> It is among the <HI>Songs,</HI> which God our <HI>Maker has given</HI> unto us; Psal. VII.17. <HI>I will Sing praise unto the Name of JE∣HOVAH, the most High.</HI> And Psal. LXXXIII.18. <HI>Thou whose Name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most High.</HI> It fol∣lows then, that our SAVIOUR is not Inferiour to the <HI>most High God.</HI> I de∣mand it, on the behalf of my <HI>Glorious King,</HI> that when you Acknowledge Him to be, <HI>The Son of God,</HI> you consider
<PB N="8" REF="002253_0010_0FDADB4D11023F80"/>
Him as, <HI>Equal with GOD.</HI> It is no <HI>Robbery,</HI> to make such a <HI>Claim</HI> for Him. Christians, Adore your SAVIOUR, as very JEHOVAH, the <HI>Same in substance,</HI> and <HI>Equal</HI> in <HI>Power,</HI> with His Eternal Father. I cannot say, you are worthy to be called <HI>Christians,</HI> if you do not so. But this I will say, you are <HI>Idolaters,</HI> and will <HI>Dy in your Sins,</HI> if you do not so.</P>
<P N="2">II. How Worthy is He to be Adored as, <HI>The Lord of Hosts,</HI> who has under His <HI>Command,</HI> the <HI>Whole World,</HI> and Every <HI>Creature</HI> in it? But so has our SAVI∣OUR. When our SAVIOUR is cal∣led, <HI>The Lord of Hosts,</HI> 'tis the same that is asserted of Him, and for Him; Acts X.36. <HI>He is the Lord of All.</HI> The <HI>Hosts,</HI> whereof our SAVIOUR is the LORD, are all the <HI>Works</HI> of GOD; Every One of which are under His Command We read, Gen. II.1. <HI>The Heaven and the Earth were Finished, &amp; all the Hosts of them.</HI> These, These are the <HI>Hosts</HI> whereof our SAVIOUR is the <HI>Lord</HI>; And it may be said, <HI>Is there any Number of His Armies.</HI> Our SA∣VIOUR is the <HI>Creator</HI> of all Things; And shall He not be the <HI>Governour</HI> of
<PB N="9" REF="002253_0011_0FDADB0BDBA5AEB8"/>
them all? We have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Learned Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ Col. I.16. <HI>All things were Created by Him, and for Him.</HI> As we may from hence in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er His <HI>Eternal G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dhead,</HI> so may we His <HI>Power. If all things</HI> were <HI>Created by Him,</HI> we may be sure, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso <HI>Governed</HI> by Him. Our SAVI∣OUR, as He is GOD, or a <HI>Person</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI>Essence</HI> of GOD, He has what we may call, the <HI>Essential Government</HI> of all things. He is Essentially, Necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rily, Everlastingly Vested with the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> of the World. But then also, there is a Glorious Mystery of the Gospel, which our Faith is to take a further Notice of. The Son of GOD, assuming a <HI>Man</HI> into <HI>One Person</HI> with Himself, upon a <HI>Mediatorial Design,</HI> this <HI>God-man</HI> becomes <HI>The Lord of Hosts</HI> with a sort of <HI>Delegation</HI> from His Eternal Father. He has the <HI>Government</HI> of the World so Committed into His Hands, that the <HI>Blessed Man,</HI> who he has <HI>Chosen to bring so near</HI> unto Him, has his In∣fluence upon the Administration. It is the Son of GOD, <HI>Incarnate</HI> and <HI>En∣throned</HI> in our JESUS; Or shall I say? Tis our JESUS Personally United unto
<PB N="10" REF="002253_0012_0FDADB50769F46C0"/>

The <HI>Sun</HI> it self is under the Command of our JESUS. <HI>He Commands the Sun and it riseth not</HI>! What inexpressible Numbers are the <HI>Hosts</HI> of those Various Creatures, which fill the Several Globes of our <HI>Solar System</HI>! The <HI>Species</HI> cannot be Numbered:

What then the <HI>Individuals?</HI> But if it should be so, that Every <HI>Fixed Star</HI> in all the <HI>Host of Heaven</HI> be a <HI>Sun,</HI> and the Center of a System not unequal to ours, to what Inconceivable <HI>Numbers</HI> do the <HI>Hosts</HI> arise? Humane Understanding tires, faints, is even Swallowed up. Well, but our SAVIOUR is that <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> who has all there at His Dis∣posal Of all these it must be owned; Psal. CXIX.91. <HI>They continue this day according to thine Ordinances; for all are thy Servants.</HI> Oh! What Cause have we to fall down before our SAVIOUR, with the devoutest Adoration!

<P>Demand. I. An <HI>Interest</HI> in the great SAVIOUR, and His <HI>Favour,</HI> how greatly should it be Esteemed of? Surely, O <HI>Needy-Man,</HI> To have this <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> for thy <HI>Friend:</HI> This is the best Thing that can be wished for. Was not that a aery Reasonable Tri∣umph? Ps.

My Friends, If the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> be your <HI>Friend,</HI> have you not the <HI>Friendship</HI> of One, who can employ all the <HI>Creatures</HI> in the World, for your Welfare at His pleasure?

send you such Helpers as can remove Mountains? Have you not the <HI>Friend∣ship</HI> of one who, if you had no <HI>created Comforters,</HI> which of themselves are but <HI>miserable</HI> ones, is Able of Himself, by His own <HI>Immediate Hand,</HI> sufficiently to relieve you?

what, what, wilt thou See the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> do unto thee: what wilt thou see when <HI>the Day of thy Watchmen cometh upon thee</HI>! But from the Ex∣perience of this Unhappy Neighour∣hood, I am Sure, there is one Thing, which they <HI>that have Ears to hear,</HI> should <HI>hear</HI> as a Thing <HI>Spoken by the Spirit unto all the Churches.</HI> Tis this; A <HI>Day of Temptation</HI> will prove a <HI>Day of Confusion</HI> to them that have it brought upon them. A <HI>Dark</HI> and an <HI>Hot</HI> Strife, But, Oh! what will those <HI>Two Qualites</HI> make an <HI>Emblem</HI> of! Such a <HI>Strife</HI>; with all the Cursed off-spring of it, will cause the <HI>Sun to go down at Noon</HI> in such a Day. Most Wisely our Glorious LORD has taught us to make that Petition, <HI>O Our Father, Lead us not into Temptation.</HI> With much Wisdom has He Charg'd us, <HI>Watch and Pray, that ye Enter not into Temptation.</HI> If you are so <HI>Watchful</HI> as to discern a <HI>Day of Temptation</HI> begun, O Stop, Stay, make a Pause; desist for a while from any further proceeding; and with a <HI>Prayer∣ful Patience,</HI> wait for an Issue which the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> will <HI>Guide the Meek</HI> unto.</P>

<P>I Remember a passage, in Psal.

<P>Wherefore, From the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> and in His Name, there are Some <HI>orders</HI> to be more briefly Served upon you.</P>
<P>In the <HI>First</HI> Place, You cannot be In∣sensible, that the <HI>First thing</HI> you have to Look to, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, That you approve your selves, even your very <HI>Hearts</HI> as <HI>Ʋp∣right</HI> before the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> in what you do, when you Say, <HI>That you are Building for Him.</HI> Verily, The <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI>▪ He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>God of Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>by Him Actions are Weigh'd</HI>; He <HI>walks in the midst</HI> of His Churches▪ His <HI>Eyes</HI> penetrate Like the Lightning; and He

will <HI>make all the Churches to know, that He Searches the Hearts.</HI> Beware, Oh!

You have Lived, where you have heard those Maxims, <HI>Pride goeth before Destruction</HI>; And, <HI>The wrath of Man works not the Righteousness of God.</HI> Guard well against such and all <HI>Corrupt Principles</HI>; For, if these are the <HI>Secret Springs</HI> of your Motions, <HI>Doth not He that ponders the Heart, Consider it?

<P>GOD has from a Flaming Mountain, with a Voice of Thunder declared, <HI>That He will not hold them Guiltless who take His Name in vain.</HI> When His <HI>Name</HI> is put upon <HI>Vain Ʋnderta∣kings,</HI> and is used meerly to gratify <HI>Va∣nity,</HI> then do men Egregiously <HI>take His Name in Vain.</HI> Wherefore I repeat the Counsel, <HI>Take heed unto your Spirit.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> have a saying, <HI>Every Church that is built for the Glory of GOD shall be Established▪ Christians</HI> may accept

&amp; improve the Saying. Oh! See to it, that an Aim at the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD, and the Service of His CHRIST, and of His Kingdom, Ly at the Bottom of your Proceedings. This is a Thing to be inculcated with the more of Sollici∣tude, Because people must have a <HI>Rege∣nerating,</HI> Rectifying, Sanctifying <HI>Work</HI> of GOD upon their Minds, before they will come really to act upon such <HI>Holy Principles.</HI> A <HI>Carnal Mind</HI> will not get above <HI>Corrupt Principles!</HI> The <HI>Jet d'eau's</HI> of a <HI>Carnal Mind</HI> can rise no higher.

You will not make the <HI>Glory of GOD</HI> your End, until you come into the <HI>Life</HI> of GOD.

<P>As a further Expression of Godliness, and of <HI>Godly Sincerity,</HI> in your Under∣taking, you must always keep up a Lively Remembrance of This, <HI>That
<PB N="40" REF="002253_0042_0FDADB7349B58110"/>
the Lord of Hosts has his Eye upon you,</HI> in all that is done among you. The <HI>Awe</HI> of that Glorious <HI>Eye,</HI> must keep a powerful and perpetual Re∣straint upon you, and prevent all <HI>Dis∣orders</HI> among you. <HI>The Lord of Hosts Looking on</HI>; This must cause you to <HI>March Regularly,</HI> make every one keep his <HI>Rank,</HI> and Suppress all Approaches to <HI>Mutinies.</HI></P>
<P>But I cannot be a <HI>Faithful Messenger,</HI> if I do not put you in mind of This, That the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> will Expect it from you, that you <HI>keep Close to His Word,</HI> in all the Administrations of His <HI>House</HI> among you. If <HI>Humane In∣ventions,</HI> or any parts or means of <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> not Instituted by the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> are brought in, to the prejudice of the <HI>Divine Institutions</HI> among you, the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD will be <HI>defiled.</HI> A <HI>Jealous</HI> GOD so provok'd, will be gone, will go far away, from the <HI>polluted Sanctuary.</HI> Upon your <HI>Loyal∣ty</HI> to the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> in this point, will turn your Enjoyment of His <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> among you.

stands as a flaming Sword in the Hand of the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> to terrify you from all Sinful Deviations.</P>
<P>And while you pay just Regards to the <HI>Word</HI> of your SAVIOUR, how comfortably may you Look up to <HI>the Lord of Hosts,</HI> to give you such a Dis∣penser of His <HI>Word,</HI> as may be a <HI>Pastor after His own Heart,</HI> that shall <HI>feed you with Knowledge and Ʋnderstanding.</HI> Such an one must be among the <HI>Gifts</HI> of that <HI>Ascended Lord,</HI> who has the <HI>Chariots</HI> of GOD in His <HI>Holy Place</HI> a∣bout Him. And He will bestow <HI>Good Gifts</HI> upon them that <HI>Ask</HI> Him for them: Yea, <HI>for the Rebellious also!</HI></P>
<P>In fine; We can press nothing so much as This upon you, That you do all that you can, to obtain it, and se∣cure it, That the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> may afford you His <HI>Gracious Presence,</HI> and that you Shun Every Thing that may forfeit it. Happy, Happy are you, if you may have that Word from Hea∣ven to you; <HI>Be Strong, and Work; For I am with you, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI></P>

Luk. 1.6. By reason of the greatness of their num∣ber, and distance of their Habitati∣ons, they can't all assemble for Reli∣gious Worship in one and the same place. It is necessary therefore, that they should meet in many distinct Companies or Assemblies, to attend that Religious Worship which is pre∣scribed to them. Such distinct Com∣panies or Assemblies of Worshipping Christians, are sundry times in the New Testament, called <HI>Churches.</HI> Thus we read of the <HI>Churches of Judea</HI> (Gal. 1.21.) <HI>Galatia</HI> (1 Cor. 16.1.) and of the <HI>Churches throughout all Judea, Gali∣lee, and Samaria.</HI> Acts 9.31.

had a very glorious, dazling, amazing Vision of the Son of God, the Lord Christ, who directed him to write his mind and will to those Seven Churches of <HI>Asia.</HI> An Account of this glorious Vision, we have in the first Chapter of this Book, containing our Text.

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. The Lord Jesus Christ walks in the midst of his Churches, which are com∣pared to Golden Candlesticks.</HEAD>
<P>Here are three PROPOSITIONS. viz. 1. <HI>The Churches of Christ are com∣pared to Candlesticks.</HI> 2. <HI>To Candle∣sticks of Gold.</HI> 3. <HI>The Lord Jesus walks in the midst of them.</HI></P>
<P>Prop. 1. <HI>The Churches of Christ are compared to Candlesticks.</HI> Their being compared to <HI>Candlesticks,</HI> may proba∣bly be in allusion to the Seven <HI>Lamps</HI> or <HI>Lights,</HI> that were in the <HI>Golden Candle∣stick</HI> in the Tabernacle of old. That Golden Candlestick had <HI>seven Lamps to give light,</HI> Exod. 25.37. Numb. 8.2. The Churches of Christ may be compared to Candlesticks.</P>
<P N="1">1. From their <HI>receiving of Light.</HI> If we consider a Candlestick, as to the substance and matter of which it is made; it has no inlightning quality or efficacy, but 'tis, adapted or fitted

They are therefore truly called <HI>Churches,</HI> in the Plural Number; as being <HI>Several</HI> or <HI>Many</HI> in Number. Christ will make the <HI>Churches</HI> to know,

that he searches the Reins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Epistles sent to the Seven Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> it's evident that they were <HI>distinct Societies,</HI> or Bodies Politick; Some are commended and no fault found with them, others are commended for some things and blamed for others. Parti∣cular Churches therefore, should ob∣serve the <HI>Laws of Society</HI> according to Scripture Rule. Tho' in general, all Christians and Ministers, as they have opportunity should do good to all men (Gal. 6.10.) yet they are under Special Ties and Obligations, to those particular Churches they are more Immediately related to. Ministers should not without Substantial, Weigh∣ty and manifest Reasons, quit those particular Churches they have taken the Pastoral care &amp; charge of; neither should particular Members of Churches, without the like Reasons forsake the Church-Society they have voluntarily Joyned themselves to. If Persons dont look upon themselves as Ti'd and Bound by their own free choice, and voluntary Ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gements, then humane Societies may soon dissolve and vanish

into nothing. Some are too apt to say <HI>a Church is no Prison,</HI> therefore tho' they have solemnly Covenanted to walk with God, and the Members of this or that particular Church where they Joyned, yet they are at Liberty to go when and where they please. Indeed 'tis Senseless &amp; Ridiculous to argue after such a manner; will nothing but a <HI>Prison</HI> hold them? has <HI>Conscience</HI> no Influence to bind them to their duty? what, be∣cause a <HI>Church is no Prison,</HI> shall they therefore break their Bonds and Co∣venant, which of their own choice they freely and voluntarily brought them∣selves under? This is for Persons to have no regard to their word, to their own voluntary Ingagements. Thus to Argue and Act in these matters, I think is a vain trifling with God and Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Churches and the Members of them, should Walk and Act as knowing they are under the Eye of Christ.</HI> This should restrain them from Sinning, &amp; quicken them to duty. Very often, the pre∣sence of some Serious, Grave man, will

<PB N="29" REF="002253_0077_0FDADBED85D2E3F8"/>
knowing they are under the All-seeing Eye of that Holy and Glorious Judge, who cannot be deceived and wont be mocked.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Churches should Indeavour to be Golden Candlesticks.</HI> They should <HI>Receive</HI> all the Light they can from Jesus Christ, by studiously and diligent∣ly <HI>Reading</HI> his Holy Word; Hearing of it Preached, attending on all his Holy Ordinances, Praying earnestly and constantly for the <HI>Influences of his Spirit,</HI> &amp; Living up to the Light they have. They should also <HI>Exhibit</HI> and hold forth Light to all about them, by conform∣ing themselves to the Rules of Christs word.

nothing among you that is justly offen∣sive to the pure Eyes of his Glory. Churches should Indeavour to be <HI>Gold∣en Candlesticks</HI>; and should be <HI>Humble</HI> that they have been no more so. May we not here lament and say, as Lam. 4.1. <HI>How is the Gold become dim! How is the fine Gold changed</HI>! Alas, if par∣ticular persons are considered, is there not much <HI>Darkness</HI> instead of <HI>Light,</HI> in many? How Loose, Ungirt, Unguarded is the <HI>Conversation</HI> of many; instead of that <HI>Puritie,</HI> that <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> which should appear therein? We all have need to look about our selves, to search and try our ways, to Repent and do the works God requires of us; lest he come quickly and remove our Candlesticks out of their places.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Those who are about Imbodying themselves into a Church state; should Indeavour to approve themselves to Christ therein.</HI> If they are about to become a <HI>Candlestick</HI> of the Lord, they should strive to be a <HI>Golden</HI> one; they should approve themselves to the Lord Jesus in the business before them.

you to do, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o are the occasion of our thus Assembling at this time.</P>
<P>To you therefore who have Ingaged in the Building of this House, for the worship of God and administrations of his Holy Ordinances; and have in view, the Imbodying into a Church state here, to you I would say,
<Q><HI>1.</HI> Examine your selves about, and be humble for what has been amiss in your proceedings.</Q>
We are but Stewrads of what we possess, we should Imploy our Talents, our Estates, all our Abilities <HI>as good Stew∣ards of Gods manifold grace</HI> 1 Pet. 4.10. <HI>Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we should do all to the Glory of God.</HI> 1 Cor. 10.31. Well have you had Pure, Sincere aims at the Glory of God, in doing what you have done, and ex∣pending the cost you have been at? What you have done in this matter, has it been really <HI>a Sacrifice to God</HI>; alluding to that Heb. 13.16. Have you not been too much Sway'd by resentments, &amp;
<PB N="32" REF="002253_0080_0FDADBA7012F40D0"/>
by motives which should not have been so much hearkened to? Have you kept close to the Rules of Gods Word in what you have done, acted from right principles, and with a be∣coming Christian frame and temper? Surely it behoves you, seriously to consider these things between God &amp; your own Consciences; and so far as you find you have done amiss in any thing, you ought deeply to humble your selves before God for it; yea, on this Occasion of coming into a new House, and setting up a New Congregation; it is very proper that you should as thorowly as you can, search into your own hearts &amp; ways, through the whole time of your past lives; and deeply humble your selves before God for what has been amiss in them. Ezek. 36.31. <HI>Then shall ye re∣member your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good; and shall loath your selves in your own sight, for your Iniquities and for your Abomina∣tions.</HI> Do not boast of, nor triumph in, what you have done; that you have Built your House, and brought
<PB N="33" REF="002253_0081_0FDADBF16A5E63C8"/>
it to the present condition it's in; no, but be humble for what has been amiss, and be <HI>Thankful</HI> for the <HI>Divine smiles</HI> that have been afforded.</P>
<P N="2">2. Heartily trust in Christ Jesus for pardon. <HI>His Blood cleanseth from all Sin.</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>He that hath the Son hath Life, he that hath not the Son of God hath not Life.</HI> 1 Joh. 5.12. As you should heartily Repent of all your Sins, so you should as heartily and stedfastly Trust in Christ for Pardon; you must do this, or Perish. Your having a <HI>New Meeting-House, New Seats, New Pews,</HI> can never Intitle you to the <HI>New-Jerusalem,</HI> to Man∣sions in that House of God, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; unless you have true heart-purifying Faith in Christ Jesus. For <HI>he that believeth not shall be damned,</HI> Mark 16.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Strive after the life and power of Godliness.</HI> Never content your selves, with an outward <HI>Profession</HI> of Reli∣gion, nor with outward <HI>Performances</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="002253_0082_0FDADBA88B6EA2C0"/>
of it; such Profession and Perfor∣mances are <HI>Duty,</HI> but they should be done in <HI>Sincerity.</HI> Therefore see to it, that you get and keep your <HI>hearts right with God.</HI> Possibly you'll think and be concern'd, about what may be <HI>thought</HI> or <HI>said</HI> of you by these or those persons, even by <HI>men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; but your great care and▪ sollicitude should be so to act, <HI>not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth your hearts.</HI> 1 Thes. 2.4. Oh think, think most seriously with your selves; that you have to do with the Holy heart-searching God; who can't be decei∣ved, and won't be mock'd.</P>
<P>Do as he did. Acts 24.16. <HI>Here i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do I exercise my self to have a Con∣science void of offence towards God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards men.</HI></P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>Orderly and Regularly seek to get a good Minister Settled among you</HI> On the one hand, dont be hasty, rash, precipitant; on the other hand, don't be too slow and dilatory in this Af∣fair. Advise well in so important a

Matter. Don't seek for <HI>any Minister already Settled elsewhere</HI>; don't rob others to supply your own wants; this is not to do as you would be done by. Pray to the Lord of the Harvest, the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, that he would send forth a La∣bourer into this part of his Harvest; that he would Set over you a Man of Understanding, a Pastor after his own Heart, even such a Gospel Minister as is described. 1 Tim. 3. cha. In your <HI>Secret Prayers,</HI> in your <HI>Family Prayers,</HI> Cry unto God for so great a Blessing; and when you obtain one, carry it suitably to him, as the Gospel directs.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Keep close to Scripture Rule in all your Managements.</HI> Do so, when you Embody into a Church-state; do so in seeking a Minister; do so in all your following Managements. In your <HI>Belief, Profession, Worship, Disci∣pline, Conversation</HI>; even in the whole of your Conduct, strive to Conform to the Laws of Christ, who is King in <HI>Sion,</HI> and who will soon Judge you ac∣cording to your works. <HI>Hide Gods
