lively colours, and in the most affecting manner▪ the Affliction and Distress, Hu∣miliations, Fears and Desires of a <HI>Re∣penting Soul. David</HI> had been guilty of one of the foulest Acts of Wickedness in the matter of <HI>Ʋriah,</HI> which Sin he here bitterly bewails;
<Q>and as a Testimony of his unfeigned Sorrow, and that he might be as notorious an Instance of true Repentance, He sends this <HI>Hymn</HI> to the <HI>Master of Musick</HI> in the Taberna∣cle, to be there perpetually used.</Q>
In the <HI>Text,</HI> he names the very fact and bloody guilt, which was <HI>Murder</HI>; that Enormous Crime, the <HI>Guilt of Blood,</HI> shed in a very base and barbarous manner; for he <HI>Slew Ʋriah with the Sword of the Children of Ammon.</HI> He cries to God for Mercy, and makes his Supplication to his Judge for Pardon.</P>
<P><HI>Deliver me from Blood-Guiltiness: i e.</HI>
<Q>Let me not Ly under the Guilt and Condemnation hereby contracted, but let it be pardoned to me, and let me never be left unto the like again. De∣liver me from the punishment due un∣to this Crying Sin: And Lord ever prevent and keep me from it any more, by thy Restraining Grace.</Q>
This Prayer he addresses to GOD, who only
<PB N="5" REF="001601_0004_0FB3E66A83121260"/>
can <HI>Forgive</HI> Sin, or <HI>Keep</HI> us from Sinning. He eyes him as the <HI>God of his Salvation</HI>; his Prayer being for <HI>Salvation</HI> from the Dominion of Sin, &amp; from the Condem∣nation due thereunto. You may observe also a great <HI>Vehemency and Earnestness</HI> in this his Supplication; he prays in the most ardent, fervent manner.</P>
<P>Finally. HE Makes his solemn <HI>Vow and Promise,</HI> that God should have the <HI>Glory</HI> both of the Pardoning Mercy, and Renewing Grace: <HI>My Tongue shall sing aloud of thy Righteousness. Righteousness</HI> is here used for Grace, Mercy, Clemen∣cy, Truth and Faithfulness. This he would <HI>Sing of,</HI> Confess, Laud and Cele∣brate in Songs of Praise, Thansksgiving and Blessing. And he would sing <HI>aloud</HI> of it; in the most <HI>publick</HI> manner he would proclaim the Infinite Goodness &amp;. Faithfulness of God to Returning Sin∣ners.</P>
<P>GODS <HI>Righteousness</HI> is often put for his <HI>Grace</HI> in the great business of a Sin∣ners Justification and Sanctification▪ <HI>They</HI> meet together herein. <HI>This</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Penitent comforts himself in, and there∣fore <HI>Sings</HI> of it. And this he sings <HI>alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of, to acquaint and affect others there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001601_0005_0FB3E66B7B6F2238"/>There are two or three things to be observed in the words. 1. The hainous Guilt of Murder. 2. That Deliverance from it is to be earnestly sought of God. 3. That God must have the Glory of such Preservation and Deliverance.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That Murder is a Sin of a very hai∣nous and heavy guilt.</HI> So the <HI>Text</HI> speaks of it; <HI>Blood-guiltiness,</HI> or the guilt of <HI>Blood.</HI> A deep <HI>Stain,</HI> &amp; a deep <HI>Wound</HI>; whereby the Conscience is gashed and defiled.</P>
<P>I will only look into the <HI>Law of God,</HI> and observe to you how it is forbidden and condemned therein. It cries from the Ground, and brings down Vengeance from Heaven. <HI>Cain</HI> was the first <HI>Mur∣derer</HI> after the <HI>Devil,</HI> who was so from the beginning. <HI>He was of that Wicked One, and slew his Brother.</HI> Then God the Sovereign Judge said to him; <HI>What hast thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood crieth to me from the Ground; and now thou art cursed from the Earth, which has open'd her mouth to receive thy bro∣thers blood from thy hand,</HI> Gen. 4.10, 11.
<Q>Murder is a Crying Sin; it cries in the dying words of <HI>Zachariah, The Lord look upon it and require it:</HI> Or in those
<PB N="7" REF="001601_0006_0FB3E66D8BAC76E0"/>
words of the <HI>Souls under the Altar; How long Lord, Holy and True?</HI> The Heavens <HI>reveal</HI> this Iniquity, and the Earth rises up against it, <HI>Lamech</HI> was one of <HI>Cains</HI> Accursed Race, and it should seem of the same bloody and barbarous Disposition: Whether he had Murder'd any of the <HI>Holy Seed</HI> or no, yet certainly he owns himself to be a very fierce and cruel man; and he glories in this his shame, as such fierce and bloody people use to do:</Q>
with a haughty Impenitence he presumes on, and challenges the Protection of Pro∣vidence. He had a gall'd but an unhum∣bled Conscience: <HI>I have slain a man to my wounding, &amp; a Young man to my hurt.</HI></P>
<P>See how severely the Law of God for∣bids Murder, &amp; makes it Capital. <HI>Gen.</HI> IX.5, 6. <HI>And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man. Whoso shed∣deth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the Image of God made by man.</HI> Numb. 35.31, 33. <HI>Moreover, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u shall take no satisfaction for the life of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> murderer, which is guilty of death: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be surely put to death. So ye shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="001601_0007_0FB3E66E7AA80D60"/>
pollute the land wherein you are: for blood defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</HI> Exo. XXI.14. <HI>But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour to slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from mine Altar, that he may die.</HI> Prov. XXVIII.17. <HI>A man that doeth violence to the blood of any Person, shall flee to the Pit, let no man stay him.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Texts</HI> need no Comment; they utterly forbid the Concealment or the Protection of a <HI>Murderer</HI> among a people; the <HI>Government</HI> may not Par∣don this Sin, nor People interceed for it; It may not be <HI>bought</HI> off by any <HI>Price</HI> or any <HI>Favour,</HI> on the pain of Guilt on the Publick: Gods <HI>Altar</HI> may not shelter him, and much less any Humane Power or Pity.</P>
<P>Let no man think that this looks <HI>Cruel</HI> or <HI>Inhumane:</HI> The Justice of God has so fix'd it; Yea, his tender <HI>Mer∣cies</HI> to Mankind do account for this His Righteous Law and Judgment. Let us not presume to arraign the in∣finite Wisdom and Mercies of God, in a partial respect to any natural ten∣derness or compassion of our own:
<PB N="9" REF="001601_0008_0FB3E67013444040"/>
We shall so invade and sacrifice all Law, both Humane and Divine to our own weakness.</P>
<P>No <HI>Humanity</HI> or Law of Mercy will allow us to desire or endeavour the saving the life of him that is Convict of Murder. It is a wrong to <HI>Humane Nature</HI> in the highest manner; and the mercy and <HI>protect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of Humane Nature is utterly forfeited; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Revenges thereof are incurred.</P>
<P><HI>Murder is the greatest wrong to God</HI>; at whole <HI>Image</HI> the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b is, and at His <HI>Dominion. Life</HI> is the most preci∣ous of all the good gifts of God He is the absolute Lord of it, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s re∣served the dispos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it intirely to Himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magistrate</HI> is the <HI>Minister</HI> of God, and the <HI>Avenger</HI> to Execute wrath upon him that goes Evil; God has put the <HI>Sword</HI> into his hands, to cut off Evil-doers from the Inheritance of the Lord, and he must <HI>not bear the Sword in vain. Government</HI> among Man∣kind, is for this reason of the last n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and one of the great <HI>Goods</HI> to the World. But for any <HI>Private Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> voluntarily to take away his Neigh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Life, whether in <HI>Clandestine m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ner,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="001601_0009_0FB3E672742B6090"/>
or by <HI>Open violence,</HI> is the ex∣treamest Injury to our Neighbour, and one of the highest Offences against Humane Society.</P>
<P>A mans <HI>Life</HI> is Invaluable to him, and it is not to be <HI>repaired,</HI> there is nothing equal to it; not all a mans precious Substance. <HI>Skin for Skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his Life. Self-love,</HI> and Self-preservation, are an Invincible Principle, and Law, implanted by God in the hearts of all men.</P>
<P>But then moreover, to take away the Life of any one, <HI>fixes his Soul for Eterni∣ty</HI> in an Unchangeable State of Happi∣ness or Misery: and so (as one says) not only is all Temporal Good hereby at once ravished from a man, but his Soul incurs infinite hazard, and it may be damage.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>Humane Society,</HI> the Sin of Murder strikes at the very <HI>Being,</HI> and all the <HI>Comforts</HI> hereof. For there were no more living in any quiet or safety, if this might be allow'd, then there might be among the wild and savage Beasts of the Woods, where the stronger and fier∣cer prey upon the weak and mild. So that Societies must <HI>disband,</HI> and all the
<PB N="11" REF="001601_0010_0FB3E673AD3E32F8"/>
<HI>Rules</HI> as well as <HI>Blessings</HI> of it <HI>dissolve</HI> to∣gether, if the Crime of Murder, were not held Capital, and unpardonably so among men. As <HI>Jacob</HI> said of his <HI>two Sons,</HI> and all his Fatherly Goodness could not reconcile him to them, nor cover their bloody Stain. <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.5, 6, 7. <HI>Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations. O my Soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their as∣sembly, mine honour be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and its their self-will they digged down a wall. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Murder</HI> ordinarily comes of cruel &amp; <HI>cursed passion.</HI> This does not excuse the Fact; for the <HI>Law</HI> is made to govern mens passions, or to punish the Enor∣mous Outrages of them; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9. <HI>Knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless &amp; disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yers.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>two</HI> things in the <HI>Law of Moses,</HI> that were high Expressions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inous Nature of <HI>Man-slaughtere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount of God: The <HI>one</HI> was, that
<PB N="12" REF="001601_0011_0FB3E6752EAFCC28"/>
he that kill'd a man by <HI>Accident</HI> or <HI>Ʋn∣awares</HI> was obliged to flee to some <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> where he must remain in <HI>Ba∣nishment</HI> from his own House and Pa∣trimony, and in a kind of <HI>Prison</HI> there, until the death of the <HI>High Priest.</HI> By which it is certain that God meant to teach us to conceive a dread and horror of the Guilt of Blood; in that tho' the Fact were not <HI>Voluntary,</HI> nor done de∣signedly; tho' it were but <HI>Chance-med∣ly,</HI> and <HI>Homicide per Infortunium,</HI> yet that the Man-slayer must incur so much danger, inconvenience and confinement. The <HI>other</HI> Argument of the Criminalness of Murder was, that if a <HI>Brute Creature</HI> happened at any time to kill a man, it was to be slain by the Hand of <HI>Justice, Exod.</HI> 21.28, 29. <HI>If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten: but the owner of the ox shall be quit. But if the ox wore wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his Owner: and he hath not kept him in: but that he hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and his Owner also shall be put to Death.</HI> Here was another high Instance of Gods Care of the Life of Man, and of his Detesta∣tion
<PB N="13" REF="001601_0012_0FB3E676B30AFC70"/>
of the Sin of Murder. And indeed this was according to that more <HI>Catho∣lick Law</HI> given unto <HI>Noah, The Blood of your Lives will I require of every Beast.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce</HI> has the highest resentment and horror a∣gainst the Sin of Murder, it is an uni∣versal and irresistible Principle in the Hearts of all men. And famous to that purpose was that <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Com∣mon-wealth of Athens,</HI> quoted by Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> of <HI>Eaton,</HI> and since by Dr. <HI>Tow∣erson</HI>; that if only a Wall had by chance fallen down and killed a man, the <HI>Judges</HI> of that Place were to Sit up∣on &amp; Arraign it, &amp; upon Conviction, to throw the <HI>Stones</HI> thereof out of the <HI>Coun∣try.</HI> By this they gave the utmost Tes∣timony, how sacred a thing they esteem∣ed the Life of Man to be, and with what horror they looked upon the shedding of his Blood.</P>
<P>The most <HI>Barbarous People</HI> and Pla∣ces have a Conscience of the Vengeance due to, and pursuing Murderers; wit∣ness what we read of the People of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lita,</HI> who when they saw the <HI>Viper</HI> fast∣ning upon the <HI>Apostles Hand,</HI> cried out <HI>No doubt this man is a murderers

<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow to look <HI>back</HI> on all that has been said of the <HI>Hainous Nature</HI> of the Sin of <HI>Murder</HI>; It should be improved by all that are here present, <HI>to deter them from all Approaches,</HI> or tendencies towards this Crying Guilt; and People should be warned against indulging the least appearance of it in Will, or Wish, or Word; and also of all wicked <HI>passions</HI> or <HI>Customs</HI> that may but tend to draw on the Fact, or provoke God to leave us to it.</P>
<P>At the same time you see the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> justifyed in their righteous Care to <HI>Purge the Land</HI> of this Guilt; nor can they answer it to God, or their People, to do otherwise: It is their <HI>Obedience</HI> on the Divine Law, and their <HI>Fidelity</HI> and <HI>Tenderness</HI> to Humane Society, that constrain them to the Condem∣nation and Execution of a <HI>Murderer.</HI></P>

<P N="2">II. I pass unto the <HI>Second Thing</HI> to be observed from the <HI>Text,</HI> which is▪ <HI>That Deliverance from this crying Guilt of Blood is to be earnestly sought of God.</HI> This is the very <HI>Petition</HI> in the Text▪ <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltiness</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then there is Deliverance from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we should be very earnest in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for it unto God.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="001601_0015_0FB3E67B482D6628"/>1. <HI>There is Deliverance from Blood-guiltiness to be obtained from God.</HI> And that of two sorts. 1. To be <HI>kept</HI> from the Bloody Guilt. 2. The <HI>Pardon and Forgiveness</HI> of it when contracted.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We may by the Divine Restraining Grace be kept from the Commission of the Sin of Murder</HI>; and this is a <HI>bles∣sed Deliverance</HI> from Blood-guiltiness. We are thro' Grace all of us (I trust) one only excepted, free of this Guilt; and ever shall be so.

No, but God has kept us from their Tempta∣tions, or Restrained us when tempted.
