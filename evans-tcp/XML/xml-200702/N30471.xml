<HEAD>A Narrative &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the <HI>Great-Meadow-Fort</HI> fourteen Miles above <HI>Fort-Dummer, October</HI> 11th 1745, where I was an Inhabitant, I went out from the Fort about 50 Rods to our Wood; and when I had done, I walk'd towards the Fort, but in my Way heard the crackling of Fences behind me, &amp; turning about, saw 12 or 13 Indians, with red painted Heads, running after me: On which I cry'd to God for Help, and ran, and hollow'd as I ran, to alarm the Fort; but by that I had ran ten Rods, the Indians came up with me and took hold of me: At the same Time the Men at the Fort shot at the In∣dians, and kill'd one on the Spot, wounded another, who died fourteen Days after he got Home, and like∣wise shot a Bullet thro' the Powder-Horn of one that had hold of me. They then led me into the Swamp and pinion'd me. I then committed my Case to God, and pray'd, that since it was his Will to deliver me into the Hands of these cruel Men, I might find Favour in their Eyes: Which Request, God of his infinite Mercy was pleased to grant; for they were generally kind to me while I was with 'em: Some of the Indians, at that Time, took the Charge of
<PB N="4" REF="040462_0003_10166AFD58753EE8"/>
me, others ran into the Field to kill Cattle. They led me about half a Mile; where we staid in open Sight of the Fort, 'till the Indians who were killing Cattle came to us laden with Beef: Then they went a little further to a House, where they stay'd to cut the Meat from the Bones, and cut the Helve off my Ax, and stuck it into the Ground, pointing the Way we went.</P>
<P>Then we travel'd along by the River Side; and when we had got about three Miles, I espied a Canoe coming down on the further Side the River, with <HI>David Rugg</HI> and <HI>Robert Baker</HI> belonging to our Fort. I made as much Noise as I could, by Hamming &amp;c. that they might see us before the Indians saw them, and so get ashore, and happily escape; but the Indians saw them, and shot a-cross the River twenty or thirty Guns at them, and kill'd the first mention'd Person, viz <HI>David Rugg,</HI> but <HI>Robert Baker</HI> the other Person got ashore, and escaped. Then some of the In∣dians swam over the River, &amp; bro't the Canoe over the River, scalp'd &amp; stript the dead Man, and then went about a Mile further, when we came to another House, where we stop'd; while there, we heard Men running by the Bank of the River, whom I knew to be <HI>Jonathan Thayer, Samuel Nutting,</HI> &amp; my Son <HI>Caleb How:</HI> Five of the Indians ran to head them. My Heart ak'd for them, &amp; pray'd to God to save them from the Hands of the Enemy. I suppose they hid under the Bank of the River; for the Indians were gone some Time, but came back without them, blessed be God.</P>
<P>We went about a Mile further, where we lodg'd that Night, and roasted the Meat they had got. The next Day we travel'd very slow, by Reason of the In∣dian

who was wounded, which was a great Favour to me. We lodg'd the second Night against Number <HI>Four</HI>; the third Day we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, travel'd slowly, and stop'd often to rest, &amp; to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t along the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Man; we lodg'd that Night by the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that runs into the great River against Numb. <HI>Four</HI></P>
<P>The fourth Day Morning, the Indians held a Piece of Bark, and bid me wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te my Name &amp; how many Days we had travel'd; for, said they, <HI>May be English Men will come here</HI> That w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Day to me; for it was a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Day, and we went over prodigious Mountains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that I became weak &amp; faint; for I had not eaten the value of one Meal from the Time I was taken, having nothing to eat but Beef almost raw, without Bread or Salt. When I cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot of those Hills, I tho't it was impossible for me to ascend them, without immediate Help from God; therefore my constant Recourse was to him for Strength, which he was graciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly pleased to grant me: and for which I desire to Praise him. We got that Day a little before Night to a place where they had a hunting House, a Kettle, some Beer, Indian Corn, and Salt: They boil'd a good Mess of it; I drank of the Broth, eat of the Meat &amp; Corn, and was won∣derfully refreshed, so that I felt like another Man.</P>
<P>The next Morning we got up early, and after we had eaten, my Master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. <HI>You m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to Day, or I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I would go as fast as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪ At which, an old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who was the best friend! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, took Care of me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> We travel'd that Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d, and eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but it being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P>The next Day the Indians gave me a Pair of their shoes, so that I travel'd with abundant more Ease than when I wore my own Shoes; tho' I eat but very little, our Victuals being almost spent; when the Sun was about two Hours high, the Indians scat∣tered to hunt, and they soon kill'd a Fawn, &amp; three small Bears; so that we had again Meat enough, some of which we boil'd, and eat heartily of, by which I felt strong▪</P>
<P>The next Day we travel'd very hard, and per∣form'd it with Ease; insomuch that one of the In∣dians told me, I was a very strong Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> About three of the Clock we came to the Lake, where they had five Canoes, and Pork, Indian Corn, &amp; Tobacco. We got into the Canoes, when the Indians stuck up a Pole about eight Feet long with the Scalp of <HI>Davi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rugg</HI> on the Top of it, painted red, with the Like∣ness of Eyes and Mouth on it: We sail'd about ten Miles, and then went on Shore; and after we had made a Fire, we boil'd a good Supper, and ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heartily.</P>
<P>The next Day we set sail for <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when we were within a Mile of the Place, they went on Shore, where were eight or ten French &amp; Indians, but before I got on Shore two of them came running into the Water Knee deep, and pull'd me out of the Canoe; there they sang and danced round me, after which one of them bid me set down, which I did▪ and then they pull'd off my Shoes and Buckles, and

took them from me. Soon after we went along to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and when we got there, the People both French and Indians were very thick by the Water-Side; two of the Indians took me out of the Ca∣noe, and leading me, bid me run, which we did; it was about twenty Rods from the Fort; the Fort is large, built with Stone &amp; Lime; they led me up to the third Loft, where was the Captain's Cham∣ber; a Chair was bro't that I might set by the Fire and warm me. Soon after the Indians that I be∣long'd to, and others that were there, came into the Chamber, among whom was one I knew, named <HI>Pealtomy</HI>; he came and spake to me, and shook Hands with me; and I was glad to see him: He went out, but soon return'd and brought to me ano∣ther Indian named <HI>Amrusus,</HI> Husband to Mrs. <HI>Eunice Williams,</HI> Daughter of the late Rev. Mr <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Deerfield</HI>; he was glad to see me, and I to see him. He asked me after his Wife's Relations, and shew'd a great deal of Respect to me. A while after this, the Indians sat in a Ring in the Chamber, and <HI>Pealtomy</HI> came to me, and told me, I must go sing and dance before the Indians; I told him, I could not: He told me over some Indian Words, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me sing <HI>them:</HI> I told him, I could not. With that the rest of the Fort who could speak some English came to me, &amp; bid me sing it in English, which was, <HI>I don't know where I go</HI>; which I did, dancing round that R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng three Times; and then I sat down by the Fire: The Priest came to me, and gave me a Dram of Rum; after that the Captain brought me Part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Loaf of Bread and a Plate of Butter, and ask'd me

to eat, which I did heartily; for I had not eate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Bread from the Time I was taken till then. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> French Priest and all the Officers shew'd me a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deal of Respect: The Captain gave me a Pair of good Buckskin Shoes, the Priest fix'd them on my Feet; and we stay'd there that Night; where I slep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Priest, Captain &amp; Lieut: The Lieutenant'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name was <HI>Ballock,</HI> he had been a Prisoner at <HI>Boston</HI> and had been at <HI>Northampton</HI> and the Towns ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abouts.

them, in their Way, then they gave a Shout, and left off. Two of them came to me, one of whom smote me on one Cheek, to'ther on the other, which made the Blood run plentifully. Then they bid me sing and dance again, which I did with them, and they with me, shouting as before. Then two French Men took me under each Arm, and run so fast that the Indians could not keep up with us to hurt me: We ran about 40 Rods to another House; where a Chair was bro't for me to set down: The House was soon full of French &amp; Indians, and round the House they were looking in at the Windows. A French Gentleman came to me, took me by the Hand, and led me into a small Room, where none came in but such as he admitted: He gave me Victuals and Drink: Several French Gentlemen and Indians came in, and were civil to me. The Indians who came in, could speak English; they shook Hands with me, call'd me, Brother. They told me they were all Soldiers, and were going to <HI>New-England:</HI>
They said, they should go to my Town; which was a great Damp to my Spirit, 'till I heard of their Re∣turn, where they had been, and what they had done A while after this, the Indians whom I belong'd to, came to me, and told me we must go; which we did; and after going down the River about two Miles, we came to the thickest of the Town, where was a large Fort built with Stone and Lime, &amp; very large and fine Houses in it; where was the General of the Army I sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of before: He asked me, what News from <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Boston</HI>; I told him such as I tho't convenient, and omitted the rest; and then

went down to the Canoes, when some of the Indians went and got a plenty of Bread &amp; Beef, which they put into the Canoes, and then we went into a French House, where we had a good Supper: There came in several French Gentlemen to see me, who were civil to me; one of them gave me a <HI>Crown</HI> Sterl. We lodg'd there 'till about two Hours before Day, when we arose, and went down the River; I sup∣pose we went a Hundred Miles that Day, which bro't us into the great River call'd <HI>Quebec-River</HI>; we lodg'd that Night in a French House, and were ci∣villy treated.</P>
<P>The next Day we went down the River, and I was carried before the Governour there, which was the Sabbath, and the 16th Day after my being taken. We stay'd there about three Hours, and were well treated by the French; and then the Indians were order'd to carry me down t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Quebeck</HI>; which was 90 Miles further: We went down the River about three Miles that Night; then went ashore, and lodg'd the remainder of the Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning we set off, and the second Day which was the 18th from the Time I was taken, we arrived at <HI>Quebec.</HI> The Land is inhabited on both Sides the River from the Lake to <HI>Quebec,</HI> which is at least two Hundred Miles, but especially from <HI>Shamballe</HI> very thick, so that the Houses are within Sight of one another all the Way.</P>
<P>But to return; after we arrived at <HI>Quebec,</HI> I was carried up into a large Chamber which was full of Indians, who were civil to me: Many of the French came in to see me, and were very kind to me: I

stay'd there about two Hours, when a French Gen∣tleman who could speak good English came in and told me, I must go with him to the Governour; which I did; and after answering to a great many Questi∣ons, and treated with as much Bread &amp; Wine as I desir'd, I was sent with an Officer to the Guard House, and led into a small Room, where was an English-Man named <HI>William Stroud,</HI> a Kinsman of the Hon. Judge <HI>Lynde's</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>: He belong'd to <HI>South<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Carolina,</HI> and had been at <HI>Quebec</HI> six Years, whom the Governour kept confin'd for fear he shou'd leave them and go to <HI>New-England,</HI> and discover their Strength: Mr. <HI>Stroud</HI> and I were kept in the Guard-House one Week, with a Sufficiency of Food and Drink: The French Gentlemen kept coming in to see me, &amp; was very civilly treated by them: I had the better Opportunity of discoursing with them as Mr. <HI>Stroud</HI> was a good Interpreter.</P>
<P>After this we were sent to Prison, where I found one <HI>James Kinlade,</HI> who was taken 14 Days before I was, at <HI>Sheepscot</HI> at the Eastward in <HI>New-England:</HI> I was much pleased with his Conversation, esteeming him a Man of true Piety: We were kept in Prison eight Days, with Liberty to keep in the Room with the Prison-keeper. We were daily visited by Gen∣tlemen and Ladies, who shew'd us great Kindness, in giving us Money and other Things, and a pleasant Behaviour towards us; blessed be God therefor, for I desire to ascribe all the Favours I have been the Partaker of ever since my Captivity, to the abun∣dant Grace &amp; Goodness of a bountiful God, as the first Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="040462_0012_10166B13B85372E8"/>After this, Mr. <HI>Kinlade</HI> and I were send to ano∣ther Prison, where were 22 Seamen belonging to several Parts of our King's Dominions, three of them Captains of Vessels, viz. <HI>James Southerland</HI> of <HI>Cape-Cod, William Chipman</HI> of <HI>Marblehead, William Pote</HI> of <HI>Casco-Bay</HI>; this Prison was a large House built with Stone &amp; Lime two Feet thick, and about 120 Feet long. We had two large Stoves in it, &amp; Wood enough, so that we could keep our selves warm in the coldest Weather. We had Provision sufficient, viz. two Pound of good Wheat Bread, one Pound of Beef, and Peas answerable, to each Man ready dress'd every Day.</P>
<P>When I had been there a few Days the Captives desir'd me to lead them in carrying on Morning and Evening Devotion, which I was willing to do: We had a Bible, a Psalm-Book, and some other good Books; our constant Practice was to read a Chapter in the Bible, and sing Part of a Psalm, and to pray, Night and Morning.</P>
<P>When I was at the first Prison I was stript of all my old and lousey Cloaths, and had other Cloathing given me from Head to Foot, and had many Kind∣nesses shewn me by those that liv'd thereabouts, more especially by one Mr. <HI>Corby</HI> and his Wife, who gave me Money there, and brought me many good Things at the other Prison. But here I was taken ill, as was also most of the other Prisoners, with a Flux, which lasted near a Month, so that I was grown very weak, but after that I was healthful, thro' divine Goodness, blessed be God for it: I was much concern'd for my Country, especially for the Place I was taken from,
<PB N="14" REF="040462_0013_10166B1637008930"/>
by Reason that I met an Army going thither, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they told me: The 27th Day of <HI>November</HI> we had News come to the Prison that they were come back to <HI>Shamballe,</HI> and had taken upwards of a Hundred Captives, which increas'd my Concern, for I ex∣pected our Fort, &amp; others thereabouts, were destroy'd▪ which put me upon earnest Prayer to God, that he would give me Grace to submit to his Will; after which I was easy in my Mind.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight after, a Dutchman was bro't to Prison, who was one of the Captives the said Ar∣my had taken; he told me they had burnt Mr. <HI>Ly∣dius</HI>'s Fort, and all the Houses at that new Township and had kill'd Capt. <HI>Schyler</HI> and five or six more, and had brought 50 Whites and about 60 Negroes to <HI>Montreal:</HI> I was sorry to hear of so much Mischie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done, but rejoyc'd they had not been upon our River and the Towns thereabouts; for which I gave Thanks to God for his great Goodness in preserving them, and particularly my Family.</P>
<P>When Christmas came, the Governour sent us 24 Livres; the Lord-Intendant came into the Prison and gave us 24 Livres more, which was about two Guineas: He told us he hop'd we should be sent Home in a little Time; he was a pleasant Gentle∣man, and very kind to the Captives: Some time af∣ter Mr. <HI>Shearly</HI> a Gentleman of Quality came to us, and gave to the three Sea Captains 24 Livres, and to me twelve, and the next Day sent me a Bottle of Cla∣ret Wine. About ten Days after he sent me twelve Livres more; it was in all <HI>eight Pounds</HI> old Tenor.</P>
