<HEAD>The Curate of Elmwood. A TALE,</HEAD>
<P>IF thou art a Curate, O reader, and hast already <HI>one</HI> parish in thy pos∣session, be contented, and seek not to have <HI>two.</HI> Be assured that content∣ment is better than to have <HI>two liv∣ings.</HI></P>
<P>Many good people besides Shake∣speare, have been born upon the Av∣on; and one of them was the Curate of the Parish of Elmwood, Of a family of nine people, parents and children, only he and his daughter JULIA remained.</P>
<P>The old parson could do many things besides eating his pudding, drink his October, and collect his tithes;—important qualifications, which have been, from time immemorial, annexed to the office of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>te.— He carried the sciences in his head,
<PB N="6" REF="039105_0005_10139C51466F6278"/>
and morality in his heart; I mean, so far as they are connected with man∣ners or sentiment—added to this, he preached an excellent sermon, wore his own grey hairs, and had the gout; but above all, he loved, most dearly loved, his beautiful daughter JULIA.</P>
<P>And well did she deserve his love. —Sweet Maid! if ever I forget thee, may my fancy lose her flights, and my pen its movements; if ever I for∣get the majestic elegance of thy form —or the liquid blue swimming in thy eye—or the half rose, half-lily colours glowing on thy cheek, like the streaks of the west in a July eve∣ning.—</P>
<P>Her person had all those undescrib∣able points of divine beauty, which the pure imagination ascribes to an∣gels—her mind was fashioned by the sciences—her disposition by charity, and her sentiment by truth.</P>
<P>The mansion of these contented re∣latives rose in the centre of the par∣ish—it was neither stately nor proud —like its inhabitants, it was modest,
<PB N="7" REF="039105_0006_10139C53085F20A0"/>
and seemed to retire into an obscure and silent glade, formed between va∣rious clumps of shrubbery, and a ridge of rising ground. At a small distance rolled the silver Avon, ever musical, now mantling over a rocky channel, and now gliding through plains and fields covered with wild flowers.</P>
<P>Through these fields, and along these skirted banks, full oft did the Curate and his daughter pursue their walk—in that sweet hour of the eve∣ning, when the sun seems dropping behind the hills, and throws a feeble but pleasing beam over the landscape; then might you see them wander, arm in arm, and slowly on the Avon∣side. "JULIA (he would say to his daughter) my dear JULIA, you and my parish are the comforts of my life. Ye are all my children—but you, JU∣LIA, you are my friend—the thirsty loves not to drink, nor the weary to rest, more than I love to look upon <HI>you</HI>—what would become of me, JU∣LIA,
<PB N="8" REF="039105_0007_10139C569215F970"/>
wert thou gone? And when I am gone, my daughter, what will be∣come of thee?"—"I hope, father, we shall die both together."—"God grant it! God grant it!" answered the good old man.</P>
<P>Thus peaceably glided on their lives, till an unlucky accident in the neigh∣bouring parish disturbed their tran∣quility. The vicar of that parish di∣ed.—The moment our Curate was informed of this, it roused one of his worst passions: he had now but one wish to be gratified in this world; and that was, to have the neighbour∣ing vicarage in possession. "My dear father (said the unambitious JULIA) have we not competence; and does not competence afford us felicity? and is not this sufficient?"—Aye, all that was very true: but then the vi∣carage lay so snug—just at his own door; and he wanted to have it in his power to leave something to his JULIA after his death.</P>
<P>But much remained yet to be done. The Curate had talked like a man un∣acquainted
<PB N="9" REF="039105_0008_10139C58187B3258"/>
with calculations, and his fancy (old as it was) got the start of his judgment. He did not consider that Lord C— the patron of the living, resided at London, and that his own limbs were too gouty to car∣ry him thither—for personal applica∣tion is absolutely necessary in these cases: besides, the clergy, though they are continually advising their flocks to keep their eyes fixed upon the good things of heaven only, have an irresistible propensity to keep their own eyes uniformly fixed upon the good things of this earth—every mo∣ment, therefore, was important—to lose a minute was to lose a vicarage; and while he was talking, some other reverend brother, who had no gout in his toes, no daughter to provide for, might be posting to his Lordship in Berkeley-Square.</P>
<P>The old man became now greatly agitated; and that bosom, which ought to have been the mansion of resigna∣tion and peace, was disturbed by rest∣less
<PB N="10" REF="039105_0009_10139C5AA7336298"/>
wishes, and ill-timed despair. The sympathetic soul of JULIA was tu∣multuous; her heart throbbed with guiltless pangs, and she felt for the griefs of her father. She tried to soothe him, but tried in vain; she argued against his wishes, but she was arguing against the follies of old age, which are incurable.</P>
<P>The evening came, but came not as usual; this man of despair was un∣conscious of its charms—his soul was deaf to the voice of nature, even when her notes were sweetest—at the close of the day. He listened not to the minstrelsy of the hinds, nor the cho∣ral harmony of the groves; the flocks clustered in the meadows unnoticed: and the sun poured his evening glo∣ries over the hamlet unregarded— even JULIA did not charm him: he saw her kneel at his side without e∣motion, and he heard her sighs with∣out pity.</P>
<P>Here a father and a friend was lost to happiness—the only friend too she had in the world—and sorrows much
<PB N="11" REF="039105_0010_10139C5C30A54328"/>
less than these would have murdered the peace of JULIA.—She had already knelt by the side of her worn parent: she now clasped his hand closely in her own, and fixing her blue eyes pa∣thetically on his countenance, begged that he would not refuse her one re∣quest—"What was that?"—To per∣mit <HI>her</HI> to go to London, and solicit the living.</P>
<P>Electricity could not touch him quicker. The voice of JULIA was pa∣thetic, and it awakened him—his af∣fections returned in an instant: he leaned over his daughter, and gave her to understand, that it was impos∣sible to grant her request; that he would not part with her for a bishop∣rick; and that she must not think to part with him—she replied; he an∣swered; and she re-answered; in short, the contest was long, stubborn, and eloquent; and though there was not much learning in it, it abounded with nature, a richer quality—suffice it to say, that JULIA conquered; and she obtained, with great difficulty, what
<PB N="12" REF="039105_0011_10139C60C60BC290"/>
she called the honorable office of be∣ing her father's messenger.</P>
<P>It has been observed already, that dispatch is one of the few roads to preferment. As no time was there∣fore to be lost, it was agreed that she should set off the next morning. The Warwick stage passed through the neighbouring market-town, and she might walk thither to meet it. The old man retired to get his letters rea∣dy, and JULIA to make her little pre∣parations for her calamitous journey.</P>
<P>How they slept, themselves knew best; but when the morning came, the Curate's opinions were entirely changed. "He had thought better upon the subject, and he was resolved not to let her go—the roads were dangerous, and London was still more so—besides, she might turn sick—or the coach might be overturned—she might be killed—and he should never see her more." JULIA knew that these fears were only the tender work∣ings of timid nature, and she opposed them. In short, the contest was re∣newed
<PB N="13" REF="039105_0012_10139C624BD1B220"/>
with its former warmth; and the affection of the daughter tri∣umphed once more over the tender∣ness of the father. He consented a∣gain to let her go, on condition that JOE, his labourer, his gardener, his footman, his hostler, his every thing should attend her with his friendly care—should be the companion of her journey.</P>
<P>Now this JOE was the aukwardest mortal—never, sure, did a more sim∣ple 'squire page it at the heels of a fair lady—neither the Sancho of Don Quixote, nor the Pedrillo of Rosal∣va, were more arrant children of na∣ture—were guided by more native simplicity.—He and his occupations seemed made for each other, so exact∣ly were they respectively fitted. He was never famous but for two things; viz. for whistling, after his team, the loudest and most musical notes of any in the village—and for knitting stock∣ings: this was all the reputation he had in this gairish world—on his forehead sat candour, unprofitably
<PB N="14" REF="039105_0013_10139C64D52C8458"/>
enthroned, and on his tongue truth— his visage was the symbol of integri∣ty—his ruddy cheek was tinted like a cloud in the west, at the eve of a glorious day—the sensations of guilt had not deranged the line of human beauty!</P>
<P>Now, reader, stop a moment, and bethink thee of this plan, and of this journey—a village virgin, pure as the snow-drop in the valley, attended by a village boor, are setting out for London—for <HI>London,</HI> I say—in quest of a vicarage! The thing was worthy of a village curate—the descent of Eneas into hell was, in comparison of this, walking upon carpets.</P>
<L>Facilis descensus Averni,</L>
<L>Sed revecare gradum—</L>
<P>Our travellers were now ready to begin their walk to the market-town, which was but four miles distant. Without palfrey, armour, or other retinue, than the children of the neigh∣bourhood; JULIA and her father led the van, and the rest followed—JOE, as if conscious that he was entering
<PB N="15" REF="039105_0014_10139C67C974AF50"/>
upon a service or danger, assumed a statelier port and a more august ex∣pression than usual; with a clean shirt in his left pocket, bacon and cheese in his right, and an oak sapling in his hand, he towered majestically in the midst of the children, with a stern as∣pect and long strides.</P>
<P>The company had now walked a mile, and were to part. On this try∣ing occasion I could say much, but will not—to describe the glances of affection, and the looks of love, which glistened in every eye—which played in every feature, would be tedious: I shall therefore content myself with informing them, that in this difficult scene the simple heart of the curate failed him; his eyes confessed it, and he played the woman. The curate marched slowly back, at the head of his young flock, and our two travel∣lers set forward to the market-town, with hasty step and high expecta∣tions.</P>
<P>Having now began a journey, we must be expeditious. They arrived
<PB N="16" REF="039105_0015_10139C6A6B8AD5D8"/>
at the market-town, met the stage coach, and took their appropriate sta∣tions—JULIA in the inside, and JOE, like her guardian angel, perched a∣bove her upon the top—they went smoothly on, till they arrived at the lane which is three miles on the west side of Uxbridge; when a very civil gentleman came to the window, and desired them to give him all the mo∣ney they had—the gentleman at the window was far from being unpolite, considering he had declared war a∣gainst society—he bespoke them very gently, beginning at the right hand, and following them all, man by man, and woman by woman, till he went round to the left side—a boisterous cornet of dragoons was unhappily the first, and he gave his purse with a sullen silence—JULIA was next, and held her little money in her hand, but durst not look towards the win∣dow—a meagre cockney gave all, but begged a few shillings back, to carry him to St. Paul's—a little fat woman surrendered her purse, with a threat;
<PB N="17" REF="039105_0016_10139C6D097860A0"/>
and a plain dressed man regretted he had not more for so accomplished a gentleman.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the inn, each expressed their sorrows as their feelings prompted; but they were now to enter upon their last stage, and none had such weighty cause to be aggrieved as JULIA, who had not a friend before her—to go forward was madness, and to go backward was impossible—what was she to do?— She called in JOE, and asked if he had provided himself with any money, in case of an emergency.—"Yes that he had—and there it was at her service" throwing down his entire stock upon the table, which amounted to the sum of three shillings and nine-pence— this made despair more black—it was her first misfortune; and she thought it but an uncouth entrance into a base world.</P>
<P>The officer now entered the room, and seeing JOE there, began to up∣braid him for suffering the highway∣man to escape, when he was seated
<PB N="18" REF="039105_0017_10139C6FA09F7890"/>
so advantageously at the top, with an oaken sapling in his hand—"You stupid oaf! (said this military hero) why did you not attack him?"— "'Case I had not a <HI>swoard</HI> by my side, like you (replied JOE, with the greatest frankness)—he—he—he—! icod, every man to his trade, <HI>measter!</HI>" The argument was unanswerable.</P>
<P>The officer now walked up to JU∣LIA, whose embarrassment he perceiv∣ed; and, taking her aside, told her he guessed the cause of her sorrow; and that he was happy he had it in his power to remove it: For (con∣tinued he) I know the road too well to venture my all upon it, and leave myself unprovided with resources. Here (said he, untying his stock, and shaking out of it a slender green purse) here is my <HI>corps de reserve:</HI> I gave the robber a few shillings, and I secured this for your use." Now JU∣LIA examined the face of this affair simply as it stood—it was a case of ne∣cessity; and she thought it ridiculous for one who was many, many miles
<PB N="19" REF="039105_0018_10139C73246F3D70"/>
from Elmwood, and who had not two-pence in her pocket, to refuse the loan of a few guineas, which would remove all her sorrows. She might have an opportunity of hint∣ing the matter to Lord C— when she saw him, who would no doubt advance the money upon the vicar∣age, and thus all would be right a∣gain—she therefore thanked him po∣litely, and told him that when she saw her noble friend Lord C—, she hoped to be able to repay him. "Lord C—! (said he)—what—you are going to visit him?" "Yes, Sir."— "O—a relation I presume, madam?" "No, Sir! only a friend: his Lord∣ship and my father were great friends when they were young, and at school." "Aye, aye—your father, I presume, Madam, lives in the country?"— "Yes, Sir; he's Curate of Elmwood, near*****in Warwickshire." "Your visit, Ma'am—is it a visit of pleasure or business?" "Business, Sir; I am only come to town with a letter from
<PB N="20" REF="039105_0019_10139C74A9B71B90"/>
my father to Lord C—, to solicit the living of*****." "Oh, I under∣stand you, Ma'am. Lord C—, is my particular acquaintance, and it will give me pleasure to be your pro∣tector and your guide, till I deliver you safely and honorably to his Lord∣ship. Would you choose to alight, Ma'am, at any particular place in Lon∣don?" "No (said the simple JULIA) I intend to stay at the inn all night, and to wait upon his Lordship in the morning." "Ah! Madam (replied the officer) you do not know the con∣fusion, the disgust, and danger you will meet with at the inn: I have a mother in town, who lives elegantly: be prevailed upon to be lodged this night at her house: she will receive you with cheerfulness, and treat you with tenderness. May I perish, Madam, may I beg the honor to know your name, Madam?" "JULIA." "May I perish, Miss JULIA, but I am interested in your case, as sincerely as if you were my own sister!" This last proposal was better and better.
<PB N="21" REF="039105_0020_10139C7776CF6328"/>
To meet so good a friend at once! She was sure her father's prayers for her were heard; and she thought she could not be too thankful to heaven, nor to the gentleman. She accepted his offer; and they mounted the stage coach once more.</P>
<P>As the stage-coachman was at this place paid his full demand, there was nothing to be done but to roll into town, and go where they pleased. The fat woman lived in Holborn, and the coach stopt to set her down. "Here too, Madam, (said the officer to JU∣LIA) we may get out, for we are near our home." The artful abruptness and hurry of the summons, the con∣sciousness of finding herself suddenly in the midst of the immense metro∣polis, where she already saw strange things, and expected to see still strang∣er, her total ignorance of every thing around her; her hopes, her expecta∣tions, her simplicity, all contributed to throw her mind into confusion, and her spirits into a slutter: she for∣got
<PB N="22" REF="039105_0021_10139C7939001A20"/>
every thing, she forgot even JOE, and JOE, alas! forgot her; for he was exactly in the same predicament. He was astonished; he was in a new world: his recollection forsook him, and a mist wandered over his eyes▪ he sat nailed to the top of the coach, with his mouth open, looking at eve∣ry thing and seeing nothing. In this cloud JULIA escaped; and she neither spoke nor looked around her, till her gallant commander led her into Lin∣coln's-Inn-Fields. Now, when a young gentleman, with a young lady by his side, who is resolved to follow him, finds himself in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, the road to Covent-Garden lies di∣rect: 'tis only going up Queen-street, crossing the <HI>lane</HI> and the <HI>acre,</HI> and there you are. He conducted her into a house in the Piazza; where the polite inhabitants received the young gentleman with all the free∣dom and civility of an old acquaint∣ance, which convinced JULIA that he was <HI>quite at home.</HI></P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, while JULIA
<PB N="23" REF="039105_0022_10139C7D1EFAC170"/>
and her friend are seated at a bottle of Madeira, recollect and confess, whether we have not journied well; from the banks of the Avon, from the mansion of innocence, from the warm bosom of a father, to place our rural virgin on the very throne of perdition. Now, ye guardian spirits, whether Sylphs, Genii, or Fairies; if ye have any regard for devoted pu∣rity, now open your golden eyes, now ply your silver pinions, for innocence is in danger. And now, thou wrench∣ed old man, thou ambitious Curate of Elmwood, rekindle your piety, and redouble your prayers, for your daughter, your <HI>JULIA is in a Bagnio,</HI> and without a fear!</P>
<P>Every thing that passed around <HI>JULIA</HI> in this house appeared too plausible for her eyes to be opened, or her suspicion to be roused, for she had never been in a tavern before: and as to the incessant tinkling of bells, and the incessant running of waiters; why, bells and servants must
<PB N="24" REF="039105_0023_10139C80D6993B88"/>
be in all great families, and, no doubt, must be continually employed. The deception, I say, was good, and eve∣ry thing, appeared extremely well, ex∣cept in one instance: it puzzled her to conceive why they should be con∣ducted into a <HI>bed-chamber!</HI> But per∣haps (she thought) it was the fashion in London, and fashion is irresistible.</P>
<P>He philtered the beverage, and JU∣LIA drank sparingly, but not so her companion—he was to attempt the gaining of a difficult post, and the cow∣ard wanted spirits—It is a tribute paid to Virtue, that, though it be lodged in the possession of but a frail and weak tenement, its spoiler before he attempts to ruin it, must call to his assistance the aids of inebriety. At length his eyes glistened, and his cheek glowed—he snatched the hand of JU∣LIA—fed upon it with fury, and de∣voured it with a tumult of unholy love —if, indeed, he loved JULIA, it was with the sensations of a tiger. She started from his embraces, and retreat∣ed some paces from her chair—he
<PB N="25" REF="039105_0024_10139C825BE51530"/>
followed, and renewed the attack, and JULIA her resistance: he grew strong∣er, he grew wilder; his hand was wandering over her charms (where hand never wandered before) and he became furious—JULIA became faint —she was yielding—her tender frame was exhausted, and she could only shriek! A shriek was a new thing in these apartments, and it alarmed a gentleman in the adjoining room, who, with his coat off, a dirty boot on oneleg, and his face besmeared with sweat, kicked open the door, and rushed violently into the room, with all the zeal of a man who was to as∣sist the distressed—the officer let go his hold of JULIA, and she threw herself breathless upon a chair. The man in dishabille stared at them both alter∣nately, now at JULIA, and now at the officer, and at length broke silence: "What! force!—Why, thou damna∣ble and silly animal, what dirty busi∣ness is this you are engaged in?— <HI>forcing</HI> a woman to your wishes!—To
<PB N="26" REF="039105_0025_10139C83E37E1AF8"/>
<HI>force</HI> a woman in any place is a mean∣ness that no man of honour will stoop to—but to force one <HI>here</HI>;—in <HI>this</HI> house—D-mn you; you scoundrel! get out—walk off, or I'll kick you." We need not be surprised that the of∣ficer was mean enough to take his ad∣vice—he looked at the man in disha∣bile as if he had recollected something, and left the room precipitately.</P>
<P>"And now, my angel (said the gen∣tleman in the boot to JULIA, taking her by the hand) let us drink a glass or two, and I dare say we shall agree bet∣ter."—"Oh! Sir! (replied JULIA, clasping her hands and falling on her knees before him)—Have mercy on me! pity me!—or you will kill me." "Pshaw, my dear! I never kill quite upon these occasions—you will but <HI>die</HI> at the most.—But, child, you look dev'lish serious upon this business—is any thing the matter with you?"— "Oh, Sir! (answered JULIA, in tears) I don't know where I am, and I don't know where to go—I am just come to town in the Warwick stage!"—
<PB N="27" REF="039105_0026_10139C88DA93F868"/>
"In the Warwick stage!— What, through Uxbridge?"—"Yes."— "And was that fellow one of the com∣pany?" "Yes."—"Whe—w! And you met a highwayman, didn't you?"— "Yes."—"That was me, by G—d!" Here JULIA shrieked, terrified at the sound of the name; but he stopped her in good time: "You must not be afraid (said he) for I won't hurt you—don't be surprised, it's d—d vulgar to be surprised at any thing— tell me honestly, are you virtuous or not?—that is, are you a maid? — "Oh! <HI>upon</HI> my honor, Sir."—"How came you here then, in company with that fellow?—"When you took —I mean, Sir, when I lost all my mo∣ney—he advanced some for me; and as I had no friends in London, prom∣ised to take care of me, and bring me to his mother's, till to-morrow, when I could have finished all my business. —"Then you are <HI>really</HI> honest?"— "As I love Heaven, and my father, Sir, I am." "You are a lovely girl, and it is a pity so sine a woman <HI>should be</HI> hon∣est—
<PB N="28" REF="039105_0027_10139C8B5C347D50"/>
but I believe you, and will be your friend—nay I will guard you from harm—for, by G—d, I am a man of honor! and though misfortune and my evil spirit force me sometimes to the highway, I scorn to do a mean thing.—In the first place, as you lost your money, you shall divide this purse with me.—In the next place, you are now in a house full of prosti∣tutes of both sexes—I must leave it myself in a minute, in case that fellow should have <HI>twigg'd</HI> me, and I fancy you had better leave it too.—Trust yourself with me, and I will take care of you till morning."—JULIA told him he could not serve her more agree∣ably than by carrying her to the inn where the stage and JOE were. That, he said, was more than he dare do— but he would carry her to a place e∣qually or more secure. So saying, he returnd to his room, to throw off part of his <HI>road-dress,</HI> and adjust the rest. If the reader has any imagination, he, will conceive how JULIA'S thoughts were employed in this interval, till
<PB N="29" REF="039105_0028_10139C8CE2209A50"/>
they were interrupted by the re-en∣trance of the young highwayman, who appeared now to be an elegant handsome fellow. He paid the reckon∣ing, and they departed: It was be∣tween nine and ten in the evening.</P>
<P>They had not quitted the Piazza, when four of Sir John Fielding's men rushed forward, and seized the high∣wayman with the most incredible ac∣tivity. They swept him away, as the whirlwind sweeps the leaves in autumn, and buoys them the Lord knows where—JULIA ran too nor cast one look behind. She continu∣ed to go forward (as she thought) till she had run a great way; and then stopping for breath, she was ex∣actly on the spot from whence she set out; she had only run <HI>round</HI> the garden, not suspecting but she was going forward in a straight line. "Madam! Madam! (said an Irish chairman to her) do you want a chair?" "I don't know what I want." "My fait, but I do—you want to be carried to Starling's,
<PB N="30" REF="039105_0029_10139C8E6A35E498"/>
my jewel, which I and Conner will do in no time." "My good friend, if you can carry me to an honest place, I shall bless you for ever." "Honest <HI>plase!</HI> my honey, an if I know one honest <HI>plase</HI> in the whole town. Ha, ha, ha! honest <HI>plase!</HI>— Ah, you cunning strap; to be sure you want to go to an honest <HI>plase!</HI>— Ha, ha, ha!— Here you Mr. Watch∣man, this lady wants to go to an honest <HI>plase;</HI> can't you shew her the way?" "Aye, that I can, (replied the watchman)—Ah, Madam, is it you? I know you of old; come a∣long with me: you shall go to the honestest place in all king George's dominions—the <HI>Round-House.</HI>" The watchman happened just at that time to want a pot of beer; but JULIA not understanding his meaning, to the Round-House he led her in tri∣umph.—Poor JULIA!</P>
<P>She had been hitherto overwhelm∣ed in a kind of insensibility. The suddenness and horror of the last ad∣venture were too much for her. Her
<PB N="31" REF="039105_0030_10139C90F2524B30"/>
faculties lost their power, and her recollection was suspended. She was led by the watchman without know∣ing whither she was going; she was dragged along; without feeling that he held her by the arm. But she had not been long seated at the top of the bench, where they placed her near the sire, before she awakened from her stupor. She tremulously looked around, and saw herself seated in the midst of a horrible assembly, whose miscreantic visages would make angels weep and demons trem∣ble. High above the rest, like the evil spirit in pandemonium, sat the constable of the night, a beef-headed knave, with a pipe in his mouth, and a tankard on a stool before him. "Here (said this man in office) you Snoring Dick, reach this-here tankard to that-there lady, and then bring her before me for examination. Oh! she won't drink! well, well, that's all one if she does not drink, she'll pay; so bring her forward here."</P>
<P>JULIA now advanced: her cheeks
<PB N="32" REF="039105_0031_10139C9590269138"/>
were suffused with tears, her breath quickened, and her whole frame trembled.</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, (said the constable) you may well shake when you look at me. Hem! what account can you give of yourself, Miss?—No, that's not it neither: I'll begin with you, I think, <HI>Mister</HI> Watchman—Where did you find this-here lady here, Snoring Dick?"</P>
<P>"Found her! (replied Dick) why, please your worship, I found her picking a <HI>gemmun's</HI> pockets."</P>
<P>"Picking a <HI>gemmun's</HI> pockets! Mercy on us!—O ho, Miss, you may well shake when you look at me.— Well, Dick, go on."</P>
<P>"And so, Sir, as she was a picking the <HI>gemmun's</HI> pockets, as I was a say∣ing, I comes close behind her, and lays hold of her hand in the fact."</P>
<P>"In the fact?"</P>
<P>"In the fact."</P>
<P>"Transportation, by the lord Har∣ry.—Well, go on, Dick."</P>
<P>"And so, Sir, as I catches her hand,
<PB N="33" REF="039105_0032_10139C97172110F8"/>
she turns about, stoops down for one of her pattens, and, before you could say, <HI>cavy,</HI> hits me the nastiest blow on the skull I ever had in my life, since the great riot. You'll please to feel, <HI>Mister</HI> Constable, here is the lump as big as a half gallon."</P>
<P>"Aye, God bless me! so it is; it's a thumper, i'faith."</P>
<P>"A thumper! it will stand dama∣ages. I never had such a blow in my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I wa'ant ye it bleeds under my hair—it stoundered me like a stock∣fish."</P>
<P>"Aye, it's a clear case, she wanted to murder you."</P>
<P>"Yes."</P>
<P>"Oh, the horrid monster! Well, Madam, have you nothing to say for yourself? Ah, you impudent— Dick, take off her patten▪ that we may carry it before Sir John in the morning."</P>
<P>"Aye, that I will, <HI>Mister</HI> Consta∣ble; the patten will speak for itself, and a d—d heavy patten it is."</P>
<P>Dick stooped, but <HI>JULIA <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="039105_0033_10139C9B539F0688"/>"Ah, the cunning devil! (contin∣ued Dick) she has thrown them a∣way. I thought I heard her throw something away, as we come along."</P>
<P>"Oh, let her alone! (said the con∣stable) she's a knowing one: but she shall doll it in Bridewell to-morrow, for all that. Aye, you may well shake when you look at me, you bloody-minded—you may now return to your seat."</P>
<P>As <HI>JULIA</HI> was returning to her bench, she trembled incessantly, but never uttered a syllable. Oh, (said Dick) she is dumb-foundered with the heinousness of her crime." "No, (replied a second) she is drunk." "Not so far gone neither (echoed a third) but a quartern of gin would recover her."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, (said the constable) there's no doubt but she'll drink; and it's her turn now to send out. Please, Madam, to give this <HI>gemmun</HI> money for a gallon of Trueman's best, and for half a gallon of hot, and four papers of <HI>'bacco,</HI> and a loaf, and
<PB N="35" REF="039105_0034_10139C99C32582F0"/>
three pound <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cheshire. Here, Scout, walk over, sirrah, to the lady, and make her your Sunday's bow—Bring every thing of the best, and then we'll drink to the lady's health, and to poor Snoring Dick's head; and old Ugly-Face, in the corner, yonder, will sing us the comical song about the cat and the taylor, and make his wry faces, and we'll be as happy as princes."</P>
<P>When this oration was finished, Scout made his obeisance to JULIA, —She was just able to ask him what he wanted;—"Money, Madam."— "How much must you have?"—"Oh, you may let me have five or six shil∣lings, and I'll make the best market I can, and return you the rest faithfully Madam, upon my honour!—And if that won't be enough, I'll return for more."</P>
<P>JULIA felt in her pocket for her purse, (which the highwayman had given her) but she could not find it —it was gone!</P>
<P>On seeing this, the president bawled
<PB N="36" REF="039105_0035_10139C9CD85DA7D8"/>
out immediately, that it was a sham! and JULIA protested in vain —The company around heard this with an arch smile; the watchmen shook their heads, and the constable grew noisy; which awakened an old gentleman who had hitherto slept very soundly in a corner. Estimating the thing as favourably as possible, he had not above half the appearance of a gentle∣man. The truth is, he was no other than the well known Mr. B—, who once had three thousand a year, though he has not now sixty. He had been lounging as usual, for eight or nine hours in a coffee-house in the garden and then withdrew, as he fre∣quently does, to the watch-house, ei∣ther to sleep or drink. On this last account, he was regarded there with some degree of respect.</P>
<P>He naturally inquired the cause of the noise; and the majority informed him that it was "only a <HI>Madam</HI> there who had pretended she had lost her purse."—JULIA appealed to him in her turn; and, with that unaffected
<PB N="37" REF="039105_0036_10139CA06E575B88"/>
simplicity, which plays about the ar∣guments of truth, informed him, that a watchman had taken hold of her un∣expectedly in the street:—that she was positive she had her purse at that time, <HI>because a gentleman had given it to her but two minutes before</HI>—that from that time she had only walked thith∣er with the watchman, and now she missed her money.</P>
<P>"Which watchman was it?" said the gentleman.</P>
<P>"Me!"—replied Snoring Dick, boldly.</P>
<P>"Was it <HI>you?</HI> (repeated Mr. B—.) Ah, Dick! you and I, you know, are old acquaintances, and it is long since I have known you to be a scoundrel —Therefore, sirrah, deliver the purse."</P>
<P>"Me! (answered Dick)—Have I the purse?—I'll be d—d if I have any purse about me."</P>
<P>"You hav'n't?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"And you won't deliver?"</P>
<P>"No—"</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="039105_0037_10139CA405F008E8"/>"Why then, Mr. Constable, I charge you with—"</P>
<P>"Except indeed (interrupted Dick eagerly) something that I picked up in the street, as I was coming along with that there lady."</P>
<P>"Ah, you old fox! (said the gen∣tleman) I thought I should unkennel you. Where is this <HI>something</HI> that you <HI>picked up from the street?</HI>" "Here it is —but it does not belong to her."</P>
<P>"Pray, Madam, (said Mr.B—, ad∣dressing <HI>JULIA</HI>) is this your purse?"</P>
<P>"If it has a gold tassel at either end (answered <HI>JULIA</HI>) it is mine, Sir, upon my honour."</P>
<P>It had so—was delivered to her, and Mr. B—immediately retired back into his corner to sleep.</P>
<P><HI>JULIA</HI> now willingly paid all the demands made upon her: and the pre∣sident observed to her, that as to be sure as how she was a good natured la∣dy, and civil, and all them there things, and had <HI>given a good account</HI> of herself, why, to be sure she might go about her business.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="039105_0038_10139CA7D8CBEA68"/><HI>JULIA</HI> thanked him, but mentioned, that she did not know whither to go till morning. "Not know! (said the constable) —why there are five hun∣dred beds around you, where you may sleep for half a crown."—But she was a stranger in town, and did not choose to venture into strange houses.</P>
<P>"Lord, Ma'am, (observed Snoring Dick) for six-pence I'll conduct you to a <HI>bagnio,</HI> where you will be as safe as if you was in the Tower."—She started at hearing a <HI>bagnio</HI> mention∣ed—"Why then, Ma'am, if so be as you are shy, and a'n't proud, hire me well, and I'll let you sleep in my house.—There's nobody there but my wife—I'll seek but five shillings, and your purse can well spare that."</P>
<P>This proposal did not require to be repeated.—JULIA took him at his word, even though he took her purse; as he was a poor man, she thought she might be safe in his house for a night. Besides, she was
<PB N="40" REF="039105_0039_10139CA95E331FF8"/>
pleased with the thoughts of being in company with a woman once more. With Dick, therefore, she went into one of the little streets behind Long Acre, and followed him into a three-pair-of-stairs room; humble enough, indeed, but where all was silence. Dick awakened his wife, told her the story, whispered her to look sharp after her lodger, and left them.</P>
<P><HI>JULIA</HI> chattered a little while with her landlady, and found her to be civil enough for a watchman's wife. The first thing she begged of her was to be favoured with pen, ink, and paper. She got these readily; the landlady retired to bed; and <HI>JULIA</HI> wrote the following letter:</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear father, shall we ever meet again? When shall we meet! Are you well? Shall I ever see you? and ah! shall you ever see me?</P>
<P>"I am now—alas! I do not know where I am—nor where I have been —nor where I shall be to-morrow.
<PB N="41" REF="039105_0040_10139CABE38A9260"/>
I seem an outcast from society: I have not met one friend since I left you: every one deceives me—every one insults me: they have treated me cruelly—they have broke my heart—Even JOE has forsaken me: he has deserted me, or he is lost—or I know not what has become of him.</P>
<P>"Ah, my father! my dear fath∣er!—that Heaven which we both serve, let that Heaven bear witness, that one wish alone fills my whole soul—the wish to see you once more, to talk with you, to gaze upon you, to sit once more by your knee.—I would rush into your bosom: I would wet it with my tears, but I would never forsake it—never, nev∣er!"</P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, if it has been at any time your fate (as it has been mine, and as it is at this moment many a nobler fellow's) to be sitting in that lofty habitation called a gar∣ret, plunged in deep distress—no pence in your purse, no mirth in
<PB N="42" REF="039105_0041_10139CAD6AC19650"/>
your heart, and no beef in your bel∣ly—if this has been your case, you must well know the comfort that arises from shedding your sorrows in secret—the relief that flows from a shower of solitary tears. In such a situation, next to instantaneous and absolute relief, it is the first of bles∣sings, and JULIA now felt it in all its force—her heart was eased, and she hoped for a night of rest and better days. Having sealed up her letter, she retired to a bed so humble, that it kissed the very ground.</P>
<P>She slept nine hours incessantly, and, when she awoke, found her head resting upon the partition wall which rose at the back of her bed.</P>
<P>At the expiration of this time JU∣LIA arose. Snoring Dick had retir∣ed for an hour, to sleep away the fatigues of the night and of the beer pot. His wife was at breakfast, and invited JULIA to partake of her bo∣hea—She consented willingly; and the woman, who had but one dish, politely offered it to her guest, and
<PB N="43" REF="039105_0042_10139CB01D9F6790"/>
took for her own use a pint-pot from which her husband had been drink∣ing beer.</P>
<P>This repast over, Dick awakened; JULIA, who was during breakfast time devising what measures to fol∣low, proposed at first to engage him to go along with her to the inn where JOE and the stage-coach were; but on recollecting the dangers she had already experienced in the streets, she resolved not to venture upon it a∣gain, without a better guide than her friend the watchman. She therefore judged it more prudent to hire him to go to the inn, and to bring JOE along with him to the place where she was. Dick readily assented to this proposal for the hire of a half crown; which, he stipulated, should be paid him before he set off, as well as the crown for the bed. All this he received on the spot, with the let∣ter for her father to be put into the post-office. He now departed, assur∣ing her, that though she had not the
<PB N="44" REF="039105_0043_10139CB4D52091C0"/>
name of the inn to give him, he could readily discover it.</P>
<P>It was now rather more than din∣ner time, but neither Dick nor JOE appeared—JULIA was uneasy. Four o'clock struck, but brought no com∣fort with it. It was five—but nobody arrived. Six, seven, eight—nobody. During these intervals she paid fre∣quent visits to an object in distress, in the adjoining chamber, and charged her hostess with great sincerity, at whatever time she went away, to be attentive to his necessities till her re∣turn.</P>
<P>I have said it was now eight o'clock, and nobody appeared. She became very, very uneasy. It was now half past eight. "Still nobody!—Good Heaven! are my misfortunes never to end?" At about a quarter before nine, two of Sir John Fielding's men entered the room, with Dick—drunk, very drunk—at their head.</P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, whatever your thoughts may be, certain it is, that Sir John Fielding's men are come in
<PB N="45" REF="039105_0044_10139CB65C0775F8"/>
quest of JULIA; and I'll lay you plums to pippins that you cannot conjecture their business with her.</P>
<P>To understand it, your memory must recur to the adventures of JU∣LIA with the highwayman. He had met with her in the bagnio, and giv∣en her a purse with money in it, and in their departare from thence, the highwayman was seized—JULIA fled, and was by chance conducted to the Round House. The generous high∣wayman was apprehended upon the information of the contemptible son of Mars, already noted. When this coxcomb arrived at the office, the fat woman of Holborn had alighted there upon the same business. As the highwayman therefore was secured, the first business thought necessary was to search him, and all the differ∣ent purses of the company were found upon him, except that of the fat wo∣man.—It was agreed that he could not have spent it in so short a time: <HI>ergo,</HI> he must have given it away.
<PB N="46" REF="039105_0045_10139CB8E2798FC0"/>
To corroborate the suspicion, the men recollected that a woman was along with him when he was appre∣hended, and the perfumed officer con∣firmed it. The case was therefore plain; JULIA must have the purse in her possession. Away they sallied, with the officers at their head, through the streets, bagnios, taverns, and night-houses; but in vain: she was no where to be found. The next night, between eight and nine, one of them met Dick the watchman: (Dick was at this time returning to JULIA without any answer or infor∣mation; for instead of going on her errand, he went to get drunk with her money.) The thieftaker inquir∣ed of him by chance, as the adven∣ture happened within his circuit, if he had seen such a lady. After describ∣ing her very minutely—"Seen her! (said Dick) why, she is at my house." This information was sufficient for the servant of justice: he took Dick by the arm, and summoning one of his companions, set off for the lodging of JULIA.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="039105_0046_10139CBB72ACB3B8"/>We have already seen them intro∣duced where she was. They seized her without ceremony, and proceed∣ed as usual to search her. The fatal purse, so remarkable for the golden tassel at either end, was in a moment found. This confirmed the suspi∣cion, and she was carried away as an accomplice.—When will persecution cease to follow virtue?</P>
<P>Sir John was not that night at home, and they informed her that she must be imprisoned till morning. —<HI>Impris∣oned</HI>! She shrieked at the very sound. —"Pshaw (said one of them, seeing her confusion) you need not be ter∣rified, I assure you, ma'am: we are not going to a common prison—I have a pretty little snug house, and as close as a cage, where you may sleep as soundly as in your own bed-cham∣ber. No difference in the world, I as∣sure you, Ma'am—only that every door and window in the house is in∣closed with iron bars. —That's all I assure you, Ma'am, and notwithstand∣ing these advantages, it will only cost
<PB N="48" REF="039105_0047_10136E1A5178F238"/>
you a <HI>guinea</HI> for your bed—not a far∣thing more, I assure you, Ma'am—I keeps the best usage, the best <HI>tendance</HI> and the best wines in the <HI>Garden.</HI>"</P>
<P>Eloquent and agreeable as this lan∣guage certainly was, it did not glad∣den the heart of JULIA. But there was no choice in the case, and she followed her guides—arrived, they led her into an upper appartment, where there was a fire and good furniture—She was left alone for ten minutes; at the end of which the landlord waited upon her, and asked what she chose for supper. "Nothing."—What did she choose to drink? "Nothing."— "Oh, oh, (replied he) an' if so be that you are so <HI>rusty,</HI> good night to you, with all my heart." He then turned upon his heels; and pulling the door after him with fury, locked it with a key, which grated as it turn∣ed, amidst the rattling of chains and the clanking of iron bars.</P>
<P>Dreadful sounds to the ear of JU∣LIA—her teeth grated, and her joints trembled—this was the severest stroke
<PB N="49" REF="039105_0048_10139CF5E551F098"/>
of all. To be imprisoned! and as an accomplice of a highwayman too!— But she submitted to Heaven.</P>
<P>At length the soul, by its powerful and violent plunging, overcame the body—Wearied with affliction, her spirit languished, and nature sunk in∣to slumber. Sleep of this kind, though not always the most placid, is the hea∣viest—she slept till eight in the mor∣ning, when she arose—at nine they paid her a visit, and she ate some breakfast; and at ten she was carried, with a beating heart, in a coach to Bow street.</P>
<P>Here she did not wait long for the appearance or the justice, for every thing was prepared; even the unhap∣py highwayman was in waiting, as necessary to the examination.—In∣deed, it was thought most proper to begin questioning him apart upon the subject, and then with examining JU¦LIA! and by the comparison of their respective evidences the truth might be easily discovered.</P>
<P>When the highwayman had been
<PB N="50" REF="039105_0049_10139CBF1976BCE0"/>
examined upon his own account, an obstinacy, natural to men in his des∣perate situation, prevented him from giving any account of the purse which was missing. But now when he was informed that JULIA was really in custody, that honor which was not yet entirely extinguished in his heart, was roused for her safety—he ingenu∣ously told SIR JOHN the history of the purse, with even its most minute cir∣cumstances; that he had robbed her among the rest; that he afterwards met her accidentally in the bagnio, and gave her the money only with a view of restoring her own, that he had not been above ten minutes in her company, and that she was in ev∣ery respect innocent of the crime with which she was charged.</P>
<P>JULIA was next examined, and her evidence most exactly squared with the former. Ingenuous as usual, she took up the story at Elmwood, and carried it forward to the event of the purse; and she told her little tale with that truth and simplicity which can
<PB N="51" REF="039105_0050_10139CF76E4AD868"/>
never be counterfeited. She added that there was <HI>somewhere</HI> in town a person who could confirm her words beyond suspicion! but alas! poor JOE! she knew not where to find him.
<Q>JOE! (said one of the justice's men, who stood behind JULIA)—what is your name JULIA, Madam?</Q>
— "Yes." (replied JULIA)—The man immediately ran out, and brought back in his hand the <HI>Daily Advertiser,</HI> in which he read the following adver∣tisement:
<LETTER>
<P>If a sarten young Lady, Miss <HI>Julia</HI> (whose name is nothing to nobody, and which I doan't mention here, becaise I doan't think it proper)—sees this, this is to let you kno, Miss <HI>Julia,</HI> Joe dusn't kno where you be, and that you dusn't kno where Joe is, for he is to be found at the sine of the swain with two Necks in Lad Lane, and no where else, as witness my hand, by me,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOE ******.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This very extraordinary advertise∣ment is copied <HI>verbatim et literatim</HI> from the real paper, which I have
<PB N="52" REF="039105_0051_10139CC09F244270"/>
now in my possession—JULIA listen∣ed to it with attention, and confessed her feelings in her eyes, which glis∣tened with expectations. Not con∣tented with aural information, she snatched the paper, and devoured the precious morsel with her own eyes. In short the simplicity of the thing spoke for itself, and JOE it was most undoubtedly.</P>
<P>But it may be necessary to explain this affair. I again summon the mem∣ory of my readers back to the time of our history when JOE and JULIA unluckily parted in Holborn—JOE did not look for her till the coach stop∣ped in the inn-yard, and then he wai∣ted at the door of it for her appear∣ance. He thought her long in com∣ing, but his patience was not exhaus∣ted, the rest of the company had been out of the coach some minutes. At length he ventured to thrust in his head—but she was not there! He star∣ted back on his heel, and gazed wide∣ly round the yard but in vain. Oppo∣site to him he saw the door of a pub∣lic
<PB N="53" REF="039105_0052_10139CFA57A65240"/>
room open, and he rushed in with∣out ceremony: from thence he sallied into the kitchen, strode into the par∣lour, threw his eye into the bar, and peeped into the larder. He marched into the stables, and in short every place where he saw a door open to re∣ceive him—but all would not do: she was not to be found. He returned to the coach, took one peep more into it, but all was solitary! "God bless my heart (said JOE to himself, fid∣getting and scratching among his au∣burn hair) protest and save me from all temptations and evil spirits! I wish could see Miss JULIA again." Now at last, he bethought himself of what he ought to have done at first, viz. to question the coachman concerning the affair, and the coachman infor∣med him of the whole truth. This information in no degree abated his anxiety.—"Didn't she leave no word with you for me?" (said he to the coachman.) "No."—"Don't you now where she went?"—"No."</P>
<P>Don't you think she'll come here
<PB N="54" REF="039105_0053_10139CC351FBD220"/>
this night?"—"I can't tell you, up∣on my word."—JOE, with downcast looks and folded arms, measured the space across the yard with long and melancholy strides. He walked into the passage of the house, and marked the clock—he counted the hours as they rolled, slow and heavy, but he saw not his mistress—it was now ten o'clock, but no JULIA came.</P>
<P>They are not the severest, but they are the most anxious moments the mind knows, when the possessor of it, simple, timid, and honest, feels him∣self far from home, and forsaken, in the midst of strangers—these mo∣ments JOE now felt in all their bitter∣ness —he went to bed without hope, and he arose in the morning with des∣pair —he grieved incessantly, and he wished for the bosom of a friend to receive his sorrows—at length he dis∣closed his mind to the hostler, and the hostler gave him his advice— It was this: <HI>To advertise</HI>—"Every¦body (he said) did it, upon every subject. Always, when he lost
<PB N="55" REF="039105_0054_10139CFCDD964F70"/>
<HI>horse,</HI> he advertised for it; and why might not JOE do the same now for <HI>JULIA</HI>?—It would certainly lay open the whole affair, for advertisements could do any thing."</P>
<P>At this time JOE stood too greatly in need of comfort, not to take any advice that was offered to him.—But he thought this advice excellent. He accordingly wrote, with great care, the advertisement we have already repeated, and the hostler sent one of his boys with him to the <HI>Daily Adver∣tiser.</HI> And this is the history of this extraordinary advertisement.</P>
<P>When the justice found so many circumstances spontaneously conspir∣ing to vindicate her innocence—that her amiable simplicity subjected her to so many dangers, and that she was the object rather of a polite humani∣ty than of persecution, he resolved to interest himself in her safety—and, in the first place, he ordered one of his men to go and conduct JOE to his mis∣tress —as to the fat woman, the Ma∣istrate
<PB N="56" REF="039105_0055_10139CC4D85ECCD0"/>
told her that her money should be taken care of; and the highway∣man was remanded to prison.</P>
<P>JOE arrived—suffice it to say, that <HI>JULIA</HI> pressed him warmly by the hand, and half cried with joy; and JOE took fast hold of the skirt of her robe, as if he dreaded her running a∣way from him once more.</P>
<P>The friends thus met, the justice politely asked <HI>JULIA</HI> how he could most effectually serve her? She replied, that her only business in town was to deliver letters to Lord C—, and that if he would favour her with a guide thither, she would always re∣member him with the most unfeigned gratitude—this she obtained; and, once more acknowledging her obliga∣tions to the justice, they all set off for Berkley-square.</P>
<P>Here they soon arrived, the guide leaving them at the door.—JOE im∣mediately took of his hat, for he thought it high treason to be cover∣ed within six yards of a <HI>Lord's</HI> door —they knocked, but were told by the
<PB N="57" REF="039105_0056_10139D00DF274BC8"/>
porter his Lordship was not at home —<HI>JULIA</HI> said she was sorry for that, because she had <HI>letters of importance</HI> for him. "I can't help that (answered the porter) he's not at home; and he'll not be home—I don't know when he'll be home." "But could not you guess, Sir?—because a <HI>great deal de∣pends upon it.</HI>"—"Lord Ma'am! (re∣plied the liveried Cerberus) I tell you I know nothing about it."—Sounds so ungentle, uttered by so rude a voice, frightened <HI>JULIA</HI> effectually, and she hastened away from the door; and JOE, sorrowful enough, was pre∣paring to follow—when the porter beckoned him back with a <HI>hem</HI>! and the motion of his singer. "Pray, my lad, (said this dog in office) who is that?"</P>
<P>"My mistress" (answered JOE.)</P>
<P>"Aye—From the country, I sup∣pose?"</P>
<P>"Yes (replied JOE:) I come from the country too.</P>
<P>"O—so I see—so I see.—You are not
<PB N="58" REF="039105_0057_10139CC6621E3120"/>
acquainted, I find, with the <HI>ways</HI> in this town?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir, (said JOE)—not with <HI>all</HI> of them.</P>
<P>"Why, then—(come hither—your ear a moment) I have the honour to be Lord C—'s porter; and my mas∣ter has ordered me—that is, I and my master have agreed—to receive no let∣ters here unless the bearer gives me a crown.—However, as you and your mistress are strangers, and I am a man of honor, I'll be more merciful to you, and so consent to take only half-a-crown—but mum—sly—not a word for your life—for if my master was to hear I <HI>take so little,</HI> he'd turn me out of my place."</P>
<P>"Sure I am, Master (answered JOE) indeed we are both very much obliged to you for being so kind.— But then what can you do for us, if so be that my Lord a'n't at home?" Pshaw, man! (said the porter) run af∣ter your mistress and bring the mon∣ey, and I'll satisfy you about that."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="039105_0058_10139D028003F7A0"/>"O—an' that be all (replied JOE) I can pay the money myself."</P>
<P>He drew out his last half-crown and gave it. He then ran after <HI>JU∣LIA,</HI> and as he went he murmured to himself—"Icod tho', wern't that a <HI>Lord's</HI> house, it looks hugely like bri∣bery and corruption."</P>
<P>Our travellers now returned, and were received by the porter with a more gracious complaisance. He now informed them, that, tho' his Lordship was out of town, he was on∣ly at his villa, and would certainly return to town to dinner; but that if they were in a hurry, the young Lord was at home, and that he had leave to open his father's letters in his absence. JULIA delivered her pacquet to the porter, and they were ordered to walk into the anti-cham∣ber. The letters were sent up to the noble youth in his dressing-room.</P>
<P>Now in order to prepare my rea∣ders for a very important aera in the life of my heroine, it may be necessary
<PB N="60" REF="039105_0059_10139CCA484464E0"/>
to relate what this noble youth was —A foolish grandmother had left him three thousand a year, independent of his father, and of his age; all which, with three thousand more, he gallantly spent like a man of spirit, long before the year was expired— He asserted, that every kingdom in Europe contributed to furnish his se∣raglio: he only meant by this, that he kept in pay one French, one Spanish, one Italian, one Scandinavian, one German, one Irish, and one British nymph, all at one time; which he ac∣tually did. He was deep in the mys∣teries of hazard, and knew DEMOIVRE better than the Decalogue.—He had killed five waiters, and shot two eccle∣siastics. —He boasted too, that he had killed fifteen women, by <HI>breaking their hearts</HI> with a hopeless passion. This, however, was (to use an old and hon∣est English phrase) a <HI>lie</HI>: for he never killed but one woman, and that was by <HI>breaking</HI>—not her <HI>heart,</HI> but her <HI>neck.</HI> Suffice it to say, that his man∣ners were elegantly infamous.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="039105_0060_10139D075A829F00"/>Such was the youth to whom the letter of the father of <HI>JULIA</HI> was carried. He-opened it, and on read∣ing the following paragraph,</P>
<P>"I have presumed my Lord, to send my DAUGHTER as the bearer of this pe∣tition," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>On reading this, he rung his bell with great haste, and enquired if the <HI>bearer</HI> was below? Being informed that she was, he flew down the stairs, and, looking in <HI>JULIA's</HI> face, with the most polite courtesy, desired her to walk up stairs while he considered the tenor of her letter. The servants were ordered at the same time to con∣duct JOE into the hall, and be civil to him. <HI>JULIA</HI> ascended after her no∣ble patron.</P>
<P><HI>Hic pauca desunt.</HI> We must here pass over the history of half an hour, because it is not yet ripe for relation.</P>
<P>In the mean time Lord C—'s Chaplain, who had been with his Lordship in the country, arrived at the house—he came home before his
<PB N="62" REF="039105_0061_10139CCCD35EE490"/>
Lordship, to finish some business of importance to himself before dinner-time —when he entered, he observed JOE staring about in the hall, and per∣ceiving him to be a stranger from the country, entered into conversation with him—he had not many ques∣tions to ask, for JOE, with his usual frankness, told him the whole history —about himself, about <HI>JULIA,</HI> and <HI>JULIA's</HI> business, and where she was now, and with whom—now this Chaplain was plain in his manners, and equally plain in his dress—so plain, that he scarcely appeared to be <HI>of the cloth.</HI> Though an enemy to blood-shed, he was far from being a coward; though a churchman, he was no hypocrite; and though he would not subscribe to the Thirty-nine Ar∣ticles, he was allowed to be an exem∣plary man.</P>
<P>The Chaplain having finished his interview with JOE, was retiring to his own apartment. He had not o∣pened his door, when a loud shriek saluted his ear—then another—and a∣nother.
<PB N="63" REF="039105_0062_10139D09EAF17FF0"/>
A thousand ideas rushed up∣on his mind. He knew <HI>JULIA</HI> by re∣port, and he knew his young Lord by experience—there was no doubt of the business below.—He hastened down the stairs, and listened a mo∣ment at the key-hole—he could only perceive that some persons were en∣gaged in a violent struggling, and that the chairs were knocked against each other—he tried to enter, but the door was locked.—Placing his shoulder a∣gainst it, therefore, he forced it for∣ward with gentleness and with ease. He entered; and lo! innocence was once more in distress!</P>
<P>The hair of <HI>JULIA</HI> was dishevelled, and a handkerchief was drawn close over her mouth, which prevented her cries.—Her cloak and handkerchief lay upon the floor, and the arms of her ravisher were twined closely a∣round her—a shoe had dropt from her foot, and many of the pins had quitted her bosom.—Unfortunate girl! continually doomed to be the prey of cowards and scoundrels!</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="039105_0063_10139CD0B661BCD8"/>The noble youth quitted his hold when the Chaplain appeared, and, ad∣vancing to him, exclaimed, in a threat∣ening tone, "How dare you, Sir, force your impertinence upon <HI>me</HI> in my own dressing-room?"</P>
<P>"My Lord (returned the young man, putting his left hand in his bos∣om, and giving him a full but indif∣ferent look) —My Lord, does it suit your high spirit to be told, that you are the meanest—O by far the meanest creature in your father's house? No∣ble, without worth—and proud, with∣out dignity—yon are beneath the mis∣creant who caters for your appetites. —Poor, pitiful, wretched animal! I do not pull you by the nose—I do not kick you on the breech—I do not lash you round the room—I do not in any degree deign to chastise the wretch, who has stooped to insult a beautiful, an unoffending woman—go then, you boaster! retire into your closet, blush in private; and remember that you have reduced yourself to be forced to hear these stinging truths, even from
<PB N="65" REF="039105_0064_10139D0C8ED7FCE0"/>
so humble a man as your father's Chaplain. I scorn, Sir, to tell your father that you are a scoundrel; but do not forget that for the future I consider you as my inferior."</P>
<P>He finished; and taking JULIA by the hand, he led her out of the room, and drew the door behind him.— The dignity of manhood is resistless—the peerling reddened, and the pastor tri∣umphed.</P>
<P>He conducted her into his own a∣partment, and sympathized with her in that strain of humane politeness which is ever inseparable from unde∣bauched minds—after she had compo∣sed herself, he distantly enquired (as if he had not known) into her busi∣ness—this was exactly a repetition of JOE's narration.—"I thank you Mad∣am, (said he) for your politeness. You will see Lord C—in about an hour; but previously I think it my duty to inform you of what ought not to be longer concealed from you —It is now one o'clock—Exactly at ten—about three hours ago—
<PB N="66" REF="039105_0065_10139CD35E3A4800"/>
Lord C—appointed me to the liv∣ing you are come to solicit." This information in no degree startled JU∣LIA, nor unruffled her features. She observed, that since her father had not been lucky enough to obtain the vicarage, she was happy the appoint∣ment was bestowed upon a man who resembled him so much in his virtues.</P>
<P>At the time specified Lord C— arrived. JULIA was introduced to him by the Chaplain, and he sent to his son for her letters. On reading them he confirmed what the Chap∣lain had mentioned.</P>
<P>He then turned to JULIA, saluted her with that virtuous freedom for which he was always remarkable, and fondly converted with her about the moments he had spent with her fa∣ther fifty years ago—he next insisted that she should stay with him two or three days; to which she with the ut∣most difficulty assented, and of which she informed her parent by letter. When the young Lord heard that JU∣LIA was to continue her visit, he as∣sumed
<PB N="67" REF="039105_0066_10139D0E31F71B70"/>
some pretence for retiring to his father's villa till her departure.</P>
<P>Need I mention, that the Chaplain felt the force of the eyes of JULIA! from the moment he first saw her in tears, his heart was wounded to the core—the tears of a fine woman are more eloquent than the lip of Tully,</P>
<L>—Unskilful they</L>
<L>Who dress the Queen of Love in wanton smiles;</L>
<L>Brightest she shines amidst a show'r of tears:</L>
<L>The graces that adorn her beauty most</L>
<L>Are softness, sensibility, and pity.</L>
<P>It was during the space allotted for dinner, that the first mutual commu∣nication of tenderness took place be∣tween the Chaplain and his adored JULIA: I say the space <HI>allotted</HI> for din∣ner, as either party were too much ab∣sorbed in the interests of the heart, to fulfil the demands of hunger—he had scarcely performed the first cere∣monies of the table, by invoking the blessing of Omnipotence upon the re∣past, ere he riveted his eyes upon the
<PB N="68" REF="039105_0067_10139CD5F3B30FC8"/>
harmonized visage of his beloved maid, who sat, unconscious of his ad∣oration, in a state half tranquilized; her delicate system had not fully re∣covered the tone of calmness; she e∣ven yet fluttered at the remembrance of the dangers she had passed, and would have been more than ordinary depressed with awe, had not the gen∣tle old Peer, as ardently exercised the first principle of politeness, by re∣conciling her to her situation, through the medium of attention.</P>
<P>There are moments when it might be imagined that invisible sylphs were buoyant, to direct the struggles of the soul, and cunningly lay open the se∣crets of the heart by an apparent ac∣cident, when the powers of language were denied by discretion, or with∣held by terror: it was in one of those important moments, when a recollec∣tion of the great services which had been rendered her by the young divine, came full upon her mind; and as we are solicitous to contemplate what we esteem, she modestly lifted up her eye∣lids
<PB N="69" REF="039105_0068_10139D1340137478"/>
to regard her preserver, who, per∣ceiving her aim, collected such a por∣tion of fire into his vision, that when the azure orbs of JULIA came in a di∣rect line with those of the Chaplain, the lambent beam shot through her sweet frame; confounded the domin∣ion of her senses, and enclosed her warm heart—she felt the unusual throbbing, and shrunk, like a sensitive plant, within herself, as wishing to hide what was unavoidable, from the observation of her associates.</P>
<P>This occurrence emboldened her admirer to open the second battery of his affection, by making the fol∣lowing request: "Ma—Ma—Mad∣am, will you do me the honor, to take a glass of wine?" to this propo∣sal the gladdening JULIA assented, by an inclination of her fair body; and while she sipped the rosy liquor, her cheek was more highly suffused with red, than the beverage she as sparing∣ly imbibed—the trembling of her hand made the glass vibrate on her pearly teeth—she panted with appre∣hension,
<PB N="70" REF="039105_0069_10139CD78C3EFAB0"/>
yet looked with celestial be∣nignity.</P>
<P>For those coarse and unenviable persons, who have never known the bewitching influence of love, and its undescribable movements in the bo∣som, this recital can have no force: but with those whose organization is more delicate, it will have some inter∣est—each will conceive, in the mys∣teries of feeling, what I am not able to delineate with my pen, and acquire a temporary gratification, by suppo∣sing all that JULIA felt, in a novel embarrassment so luxuriantly painful —the Chaplain was scarcely less con∣founded: he was agonized with the wish for an opportunity to be more explicit—the suppression of those de∣claratory sentiments to the object of his pure regard, which were to deter∣mine the tendencies of his future life, created a pain within his heart, and twice a sigh burst from its core, and would have issued from his lips, if his correct judgment had not whis∣pered, that it would be hazarding an
<PB N="71" REF="039105_0070_10139D15C7D25D78"/>
emotion, in the presence of a third person, which was not strictly com∣patible with policy, and might be of∣fending if not injurious to his delect∣able JULIA.</P>
<P>It is on trials like these, that the accomplishments arising from a refin∣ed education, can meliorate the pow∣erful demands of inclination: and they are so highly profitable, that in proportion as we exercise self-denial, we are but preparing the senses for a richer banquet—it was not ordained that we should make the overtures of love with a bestial precipitation, and leap over that chain of progressive blisses, which emenate from the soft administration of sympathy.</P>
<P>When the mere gross pleasure of the table had passed, and the Chaplain had fervently made his acknowledg∣ments to the Almighty for his great bounty, the venerable Nobleman tur∣ned towards his gentle guest, with a mien fraught with the sincerest res∣pect, and looking with ineffable kind∣ness, asked her how she approved of
<PB N="72" REF="039105_0071_10139CDB52BE10B0"/>
the metropolis, as he understood that she had never been in town before. —JULIA replied, with some hesitation, that her knowledge of London, and indeed of society in general was so ve∣ry limited, that she should but expose her ignorance of both, and, perhaps, do a common wrong, by venturing her ideas upon a theme she so ill un∣derstood—that she had found some of the best axioms of theory over∣thrown by the practices of a busy world, and that before she presumed to draw a final opinion, she would endeavour to know more, as it were probable the baser part of human na∣ture, might be very inferior in num∣bers and influence to those who were exemplary: at least she would indulge that hope, until conviction denied her such a cheering privilege.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of the well-man∣aged festivities of the board, Lord C—requested the Chaplain to shew his fair visitant, the pictures in the gallery, which comprehended some of the most perfect performances of the ancient and modern masters.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="039105_0072_10139C446AA9E7D0"/>As no unilluminated mind can con∣ceive, nor pen express, the delightful perturbation of the young ecclesias∣tic's heart, on receiving this injunc∣tion, I shall imitate <HI>Apelles,</HI> and pass over what I cannot delineate—he modestly arose to convey his lovely charge to the promised scene of con∣templation, and had led her to the door, when the benevolent Nobleman, arrested their progress for a minute (and minutes in such circumstances are whole hours of delay) to exact a promise from JULIA, that she would use his house, as her peculiar home, until her business or wishes in the metropolis were fulfilled—JULIA bow∣ed assent to his hospitable desire, and the parties gracefully receded from each other.</P>
<P>If there are any persons so imper∣fectly initiated in the mysteries of love, as to believe that the fond twain amused themselves with the divine conceptions of a <HI>Raphael</HI>; the grace of <HI>Corregio,</HI> or the majesty of <HI>Michael
<PB N="74" REF="039105_0073_10139CDDDF208950"/>
Angelo,</HI> I pity their want of discern∣ment—when the reader recollects that this was the first time that JU∣LIA had been alone with her young Chaplain, since her deliverance from the licentious fury of an <HI>honorable</HI> ruffian, he-cannot be amazed, that <HI>she</HI> should feel the richest display of the best artists absorbed in the superior merit of her preserver, who was so nobly active in a situation, where few would have ventured to offer an o∣pinion in favour of distressed virtue —suffice it to say, that the tender and unsophisticated heart of JULIA, was warmed in the survey of her gal∣lant and moral companion—she heard his argument with attention, and ea∣gerly gave him credit, even for ad∣vantages he did not possess—her cheeks were flushed with crimson, whenever he pressed her lily hand be∣tween his own, and she stood confes∣sedly the victim of her feeling, though her language was delicately chaste, and her ideas unvisited by a licentious thought.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="039105_0074_10139D18E5871DE0"/>Oh! love, thou tyrant of the soul! —through what devious paths you often tread, to allure impassioned youth to woe—to draw
<Q>Hearts after you, tangled in amorous nets.</Q>
yet, for they kindly influence here, shalt though be forgiven—it is from the coincidence of such events, that Hymen is enabled to maintain his dignity, and blend felicity with mor∣al law.</P>
<P>Here I must necessarily abridge the history of three days, during which the most unreserved communication of sentiment was indulged between the enamoured couple—yet was the important event not divulged to Lord C—, and the only motive to this forbearance originated in JULIA, who would not consent to that par∣ticular measure, until her dear father had ratified the proposal with his con∣sent—a special messenger was dis∣patched to Elmwood, and the answer was auspicious to their common de∣sire.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="039105_0075_10139CE077109E60"/>How supremely happy is that state of truth, when mutual confidence is the result of mutual virtue—in what portion of his being, can the volup∣tuary derive an enjoyment, equal to those sensations which arise when du∣ty sanctifies passion?—How weak are the arguments of the <HI>Materialists</HI>— how futile the subtilties of <HI>Epicurus</HI> and <HI>Spinosa,</HI> when opposed to the force of those emotions, which up∣lift the guiltless, and assuredly de∣monstrate that we shall be rewarded in proportion as we are just—that our free agency is inseparably con∣nected with responsibility; and that to pass through life safely, we must act wisely, and to be blessed, we must be innocent.</P>
<P>When, by the indirect movements of chance, it came to the knowledge of Lord C—, that his son had be∣haved with disrespect towards the pure daughter of his old friend, he manifested emotions of surprise and indignation; and ordered that he should be acquainted with the return
<PB N="77" REF="039105_0076_10139D1EC8C22C18"/>
of his son, in the instant that he arri∣ved— those orders had not been deliv∣ered many hours before his arrival was announced—he commanded him into his presence, and, with an air of parental dignity, addressed him thus: "My Son, for such I am <HI>compelled</HI> to believe you are, I require you to tell me, upon what principle <HI>you think</HI> our reciprocal duties are to be maintained towards each other?"—"This ques∣tion, my Lord, is so very singular and unexpected, that I scarcely know how to frame an answer, adequate to your desires."—"Why then, Sir, I will relieve you from this embarrass∣ment, and inform you, it is <HI>Justice</HI>;" —"Certainly my Lord."—"Then as you admit the principle, give me leave to ask you, if you hold it as just, that the powerful should oppress the de∣fenceless?"—"Assuredly not, my Lord."—"Perhaps you will not con∣sider it as reasonable, that the aggres∣sion should be expiated by punish∣ment?"—"To what do all these un∣usual
<PB N="78" REF="039105_0077_10139CE3116B6D48"/>
questions tend?—you appear to me, my Lord, to be drawing me into a state of responsibility in which I am not interested."—"Indeed you are, Sir; and interested in a very great degree."—"How, my Lord?"—"I will tell you Sir: you have had the meanness and the audacity to insult an amiable young lady, under my roof, and I insist that you immedi∣ately write her a letter of atonement, and ask her forgiveness."—"My Lord, you may have been misinform∣ed in this matter; give me permis∣sion to explain the circumstances."— "I understand so much of the truth already, Sir, that an explanation may increase, but cannot do away your dishonor, so, without any hesitation, take up the pen, and write to the la∣dy what I shall dictate."—"You will recollect, my Lord, that JULIA is not my equal."—"According to the laws of politeness, Sir, every woman is every man's superior; and agreea∣bly to the laws of morality, she is an angel, and you are a—but I will

not be unnecessarily harsh in senti∣ment; so instantaneously write."— with a heart overcharged with mor∣tification, almost to bursting, the <HI>hon∣arable</HI> offender sat down, and, with a trembling hand, indicted the follow∣ing epistle, from the words of Lord C—
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT duly becomes me, as the guar∣dian of my own honor, to implore your forgiveness, for an error com∣mitted during the suspension of my reason; I vainly imagined that the advantages resulting from high birth, youth, and fortune, could compen∣sate for the want of virtue; but my reflection has tutored me otherwise; I am now so thoroughly convinced of my own unworthiness, that I cannot be happy if you withhold your par∣don—the purity of your own na∣ture, and the truth you have imbib∣ed from the education of so good a man as your father, will suggest that all are not to be abandoned who are faulty, and that those who forgive
<PB N="80" REF="039105_0079_10139CE59E03B358"/>
most, the more nearly resemble heav∣en.—With the deepest contrition, and the most ardent hope, I beg permis∣sion to subscribe myself,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most obedient, Humble servant, CHARLES C—.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>While the venerable old Peer was in the act of preparation to seal and subscribe this letter, in order that it might be sent to JULIA, the Curate entered, but, in seeing the object of his recent resentment, he was going to retire, under the apprehension that he might be transacting some private business with his father.—"Stop, Sir, (said the old nobleman,) I want you to be witness to an act of retribution; read this letter, and then inform me if the apology is proportioned to the offence." The manly ecclesiastic pe∣rused the epistle with a mixture of pleasure and astonishment, and when he had concluded, approached the young gentleman with an air of inef∣fable kindness; and taking him by the hand, exclaimed, how happy would
<PB N="81" REF="039105_0080_10139D22E27559A0"/>
it be for human-kind, if all transgress∣ions were thus understood, and thus obliterated. "You must not be a∣mazed my Lord, (added he, turning to his patron) if I feel sensations near∣ly approaching to ecstasy, on this theme, as the object of this letter has consented to be my wife."—"Your wife!" ejaculated both in the same instant! "It is even so, (rejoined the worthy Curate) provided your Lord∣ship has no objection to the union." So far am I, Sir, from disapproving your choice, that I must instantly go and give the bride elect joy; and you my son, shall go too, and prove, by your present demeanor, that you are ashamed of the past: this is a duty that all will fulfill with cheerfulness: When virtue is rewarded all that think should rejoice."</P>
<P>Here let the reader ponder upon the undescribable emotions, which played about the susceptible heart of JULIA, from the momentous period that she was left with the Curate, un∣til she was congratulated on their re∣turn
<PB N="82" REF="039105_0081_10139CE933F481B0"/>
from the altar, by the man who had attempted to destroy her digni∣ty and peace—but it was a chain of events so diversified and so luxuriant, that no vulgar mind can accompany the progression. When a man of honor solicits the hand of a woman of virtue, the god of marriage as∣sumes a nobler port than usual, and charms with a reflected grace—then his fetters are owned to be silken, and his influence derived from heaven.</P>
