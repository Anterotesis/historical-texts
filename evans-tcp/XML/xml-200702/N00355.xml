</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Great part of this <HI>Chapter</HI> is taken up in declaring who should have benefit by <HI>the City of Refuge;</HI> and who might <HI>not</HI> expect advantage thereby. There are Two sorts of <HI>Man-slayers,</HI> (1) One may kill his Neighbour <HI>Accidentally,</HI> tho he had <HI>no design</HI> of <HI>Hurt to</HI> him, nor any <HI>Displeasure against</HI> him. The <HI>City of Refuge</HI> was for <HI>such.</HI> (2.) A Man may in <HI>Hatred</HI> or in <HI>Passion</HI> kill another, and <HI>then</HI> then the <HI>City of Refuge</HI> could <HI>not</HI> secure or save him from the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stice;</HI> To intimate which is the Scope of the Words which have been now read: wherein we have <HI>two</HI> things, 1. A <HI>Criminal.</HI> 2. The <HI>Punishment</HI> to be <HI>instict∣ed</HI> on such a Criminal.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A</HI> Criminal, <HI>He is a Murderer:</HI> There are <HI>three</HI> Particulars mention'd which if they <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the Person is <HI>guilty</HI> of <HI>Murder:</HI> 1. If he <HI>smites</HI> another man, <HI>h. e.</HI> if he does so, <HI>not accidentally</HI> but <HI>designedly.</HI> 2. If the <HI>Instrument</HI> which he smites him with be of <HI>Iron,</HI> that makes the Murder to be the more <HI>evident.</HI> In the Verses following it is added, That <HI>if he smite him</HI> mor∣tally
<PB N="2" REF="000432_0005_0FA5B310D1D7CB78"/>
<HI>with a Stone or with Wood, he shall be account∣ed a Murderer.</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Writers tell us,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>v. Grotium</HI> &amp; <HI>Ainsworth</HI> in <HI>loc.</HI></NOTE> That if a man were slain, there was diligent en∣quiry made concerning the <HI>Instrument,</HI> whereby he was killed: If it was with a <HI>Stone</HI> or with <HI>Wood,</HI> they examin'd whether the stone or wood were of that <HI>Bigness</HI> as that the <HI>dead man</HI> might probably receive his Deaths Wound thereby: But (they say) if it were with an Instrument of <HI>Iron,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enquiry was made as to the <HI>greatness</HI> of it, because the least nail of <HI>Iron</HI> might easily kill. And it is to be presumed, that a man will not strike another with an <HI>Instrument of Iron,</HI> except <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Murder</HI> be in his Heart. 3. If the Wound prove <HI>mortal,</HI> then the Striker is <HI>guilty</HI> of <HI>Murder.</HI> Tho a man should smite another, and that with an Instrument of Iron, if Death does not follow, he is not guilty of that <HI>high de∣gree</HI> of Murder which the Text speakes of; but if he smite his Neighbour so that he <HI>dye,</HI> then he is a <HI>Murderer.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here is the <HI>Punishment to be inflicted</HI> on such a Criminal. <HI>The Murderer shall surely be put to death.</HI> Only Gods <HI>Order</HI> was to be observed; he was to be put to death in a <HI>Judiciary way.</HI> Amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Avenger of blood</HI> was to be the <HI>Executioner;</HI> as the 19<HI>th ver.</HI> in this <HI>chap∣ter</HI> shews, where it is said, that <HI>the Avenger of blood himself shall slay the Murderer.</HI> The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word for the <HI>Avenger of blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> is GOEL, which
<PB N="3" REF="000432_0006_0FA5B31158D7CD60"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s sometimes translated a <HI>Redeemer:</HI> The word properly signifyes one that is <HI>near a kin.</HI> The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Kinsman had right to <HI>Redeem,</HI> he also was to be the <HI>Avenger of blood:</HI> Only before Execu∣tion could be done the Magistrate was to pass a <HI>Judgment.</HI> The Man-slayer was sent from the City of Refuge whither he fled, unto the place where the Fact was done, <HI>there</HI> to have his Try∣al. If the Magistrates of that Place found him <HI>not guilty,</HI> he was returned to the <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> there to be in safety till the death of the <HI>High Priest,</HI> and then to be set at Liberty: But if he was found <HI>Guilty</HI> of Murder, he was to be put to death publickly by the hand of Justice.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE then before us, as suited to the present Occasion is,</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> Murder <HI>is a Sin so great</HI> &amp; <HI>heinous, as that whoever shall be found Guilty of it, must be put to death by the hand of publick Justice.</HI></P>
<P>The Explication and Confirmation of this Doctrin may be set before us in 3 <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. Murder, <HI>is when a man does voluntarily &amp;</HI> unjustly <HI>take away the Life of another person.</HI></P>
<P>So that there are 3 Things implied in <HI>Murders.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Object slain must be one of</HI> Man-kind. To take away the Life of <HI>another</HI> Creature is <HI>not</HI> Murder. The <HI>Sixth</HI> Commandment saith, <HI>Ye shall not kill.</HI> The <HI>Hebrew</HI> words are, LO TIRT∣ZACH, <HI>i.e. Thou shalt not Murder.</HI> It was a vain Opinion of the <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chees,</HI> whom <HI>Austin</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000432_0007_0FA5B312346E0328"/>
confutes, That the Life of <HI>no</HI> Creature might be taken away because the Commandment of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <HI>shalt not kill.</HI> God has given ex∣press <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to all the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> i.e., to <HI>Man∣kind</HI> that they should takeaway the Lives of o∣ther creatures as they should see cause; only <HI>Man</HI> being a more Divine Creature, <HI>his</HI> Life is to be Sacred: it may not be medled with, ex∣cept in cases where the Great &amp; Soveraign <HI>God,</HI> who has an absolute power of Life and Death, hath appointed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Capital Murder is wilful.</HI> There is a differ∣ence between Murder and <HI>casual Homicide,</HI> or accidental <HI>Manslaughter.</HI> If a man shoots an Ar∣row, or throws a stone, or the like, not think∣ing that any one will be hurt thereby; in case it should happen to kill a man, it is not Murder▪ If he did it ignorantly, unawares, and no way <HI>sought the harm</HI> of the slain man, he is not to be punished as a Murderer. This we see in the <HI>Con∣text,</HI> ver. 15. <HI>to</HI> 26. The <HI>City of Refuge</HI> was for <HI>such</HI> an one; <HI>Deut.</HI> 19. 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>And this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither, that he may live: whosoever killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated</HI> not <HI>in time past; as when a man goes into the Wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d fetcheth a stroke with the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to cut down the tree, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d slippeth from the helve, &amp; light<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon his neighbour that he die, he shall flee unto one of those cities and live.</HI> Not but that a man may

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e guilty of Murdering his Neighbour, tho he did not intend to <HI>kill</HI> him; <HI>namely,</HI> If he did smite him in <HI>Anger,</HI> or intend to <HI>harm</HI> him, as the expression is in the 23. <HI>ver.</HI> of this Chapter. And it is here expresly declared, not only that he who shall <HI>lye in wait,</HI> or watch for an oppor∣tunity to destroy his Neighbour, or that did <HI>for∣merly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him</HI> shall be judged a Murderer, but if he <HI>smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him in emnity that he</HI> dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>v.</HI> 21. <HI>i.e.</HI> in an <HI>hostile</HI> way: tho he had no quarrel with him before, if he <HI>fall out</HI> with him, and in his <HI>passion</HI> smite him a <HI>mortal</HI> Blow, he hath <HI>murdered</HI> his Neighbour, and is guilty of death. This is <HI>pre∣sumptous</HI> Murder, the <HI>heart</HI> was in it, nor can it be said to be done <HI>ignorantly.</HI> There is another clear Scripture which proves, that if persons <HI>fall out,</HI> and in the <HI>strife</HI> one shall strike the other a <HI>deadly blow, life shall go for life.</HI> Ex. 21. 14, 21, 22.</P>
<P>But then 3<HI>dly.</HI> In Murder, the Life of a man is taken away <HI>unjustly.</HI> In <HI>some</HI> cases it is <HI>lawful</HI> to take away the Life of another. Yea, Matters may be so circumstanced, as it would be a great sin <HI>not</HI> to do it. There are <HI>Three</HI> cases wherein the <HI>Life</HI> of a man may be taken away, and yet no <HI>Sin,</HI> no Murder committed.</P>
<P N="1">1. In case of a <HI>Just War.</HI> There is a great dif∣ference between blood shed in <HI>war,</HI> and in a time of <HI>Peace. Joab</HI> was guilty of Murder, because he <HI>shed the blood of War in</HI> peace. 1. <HI>King</HI> 2. 5. had he killed <HI>Abner</HI> &amp; <HI>Amasa</HI> in the <HI>war-</HI>time,
<PB N="6" REF="000432_0009_0FA5B3138F939068"/>
<HI>David</HI> had made <HI>peace</HI> with him, he had not bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guilty of Murder; but because he shed blood after a peace was concluded, he was a Murderer. Somtimes in War, they that take away lives, do an acceptable service to God. <HI>Abigal</HI> told <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> that God would certainly bless, him be∣cause he <HI>fought the Battles of the Lord.</HI> 1. Sam. 25. 28. And we know that <HI>Abraham</HI> was bless∣ed, after he returned from the <HI>Slaughter of the Kings</HI> with whom he had a just war. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 2. In these cases, the <HI>not</HI> shedding of blood may possibly expose to a <HI>Curse.</HI> Jer. 48. 10 <HI>Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he that</HI> keeps back his sword from <HI>blood.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They that <HI>are in Civil Authority, may</HI> and <HI>ought to take away the Lives of men, that shall com∣mit Crimes, by the Law of God worthy of Death.</HI> The Apostle therefore saith concerning the Ma∣gistrate, <HI>He is the minister of God to thee for good, but if thou do that which is</HI> evil, <HI>be afraid, for he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God; a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that does</HI> Evil. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13 4. <HI>Private</HI> Reveng is <HI>evil,</HI> but <HI>publick Revenge</HI> on those that violate the Laws of God, is <HI>good.</HI> The <HI>Magistrate</HI> is God's <HI>Vice-g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent.</HI> As none can <HI>give</HI> life but God; so none may <HI>take it away.</HI> but God, or <HI>such</HI> as He has <HI>appointed.</HI> It is their work to see that the Lives of men be <HI>taken from</HI> them, when God has said, <HI>that they shall surely be put to death.</HI> Hence
<PB N="7" REF="000432_0010_0FA5B314616C9848"/>
<HI>David</HI> speaks, as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 101. 8. <HI>I will early de∣stroy all the wicked of the land, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I may cut off all the wicked Doers from the City of the Lord.</HI> God had put the <HI>Sword</HI> into his hand for that <HI>end,</HI> that so he might clear the <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>Malefact∣ors,</HI> who were worthy of Death, and he was re∣solved to see Justice done. But <HI>private</HI> Persons are not to arrogate to themselves that which is the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s proper work. Men must have <HI>lawful Authority</HI> for what they do; <HI>else</HI> in ta∣ing away Life, they become guilty of Murder.

But that This is a grievous sin is manifest: 1. <HI>In that it is a most</HI> unnatural <HI>thing.</HI> Creatures of the <HI>same kind</HI> are not wont to destroy <HI>one another.</HI> Natu∣ralists observe concerning Wolves, that though they be <HI>cruel</HI> creatures, they will never kill <HI>one mother:</HI> therefore if Men do so they are worse than <HI>Wolves &amp; lygers:</HI> so that Murder is an <HI>unnatural</HI> and a <HI>monstrous</HI> Wickedness. 2. <HI>The</HI> Vengeance <HI>which is wont to follow this Sin, proves that it is an</HI> horrid <HI>and</HI> hainous <HI>Transgression.</HI> There is a peculiar <HI>Vengeance</HI> that does pursue <HI>this</HI> sin at the heels of it. The <HI>Gentiles</HI> had the notion of <HI>this</HI> fix'd in their minds: hence those <HI>Barbarians</HI> could say, <HI>No doubt this man is a</HI> murderer, <HI>whom tho' he escaped the seas, yet Ven∣geance

<P>Propos. 3. <HI>The Murderer is to be put to death by the hand of Publick Justice.</HI> And this confirms the former Propositions concerning the <HI>greatness</HI> of this Sin. <HI>Men</HI> may not pardon or remit the Punishment of that Sin. Among the <HI>Jews</HI> there was no <HI>City of Refuge</HI> for a wicked or <HI>wilful man-slayer;</HI> and it is said in the 31 verse of this Chapter, <HI>You shall take</HI> no <HI>satisfaction for the</HI> life <HI>of a</HI> Murderer <HI>which is</HI> guilty <HI>of</HI> death, <HI>but he shall surely be put to</HI> death. <HI>This</HI> sin shall not be satisfyed for, with any other punishment, but the <HI>death</HI> of the Murderer.

Thus in the 33. <HI>v.</HI> of this Chapter, this is given as the Reason why no Satisfaction might be taken for the life of a Murderer; <HI>so shall ye not</HI> pollute <HI>the</HI> land <HI>wherein you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for</HI> blood it de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>leth <HI>the</HI> land, <HI>and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed</HI> therein, <HI>but by the</HI> blood <HI>of</HI> him <HI>that shed it.</HI> One Murder <HI>unpunished,</HI> may bring guilt &amp; a curse upon the whole Land▪ that all the Inhabitants of the Land shall suffer for it; So that <HI>Mercy</HI> to a <HI>Murderer</HI> is <HI>Cruelty</HI> to a <HI>Peo∣ple.</HI> Therefore it is said concerning the Mur∣derer, <HI>Thine eye shall</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot pity <HI>him but thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put away the guilt of innocent blood from</HI> Israel, <HI>that it may go well with thee.</HI> If the Murderer be not punished it may go ill with the Whole, <HI>all</HI> may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the worse for it; if the sin be not duly punished, there is a partaking in the guilt of it.</P>

<P>But thus for the <HI>Doctrinal</HI> handling of the Truth before us. I proceed to make some <HI>Ap∣plication.</HI> (1.) By way of <HI>Information.</HI> (2.) For <HI>Exhortation.</HI></P>
<P>Infor. 1. <HI>This Doctrin</HI> justifyeth <HI>the</HI> Autho∣rity <HI>hore, in respect of the</HI> Sentence <HI>of</HI> Death <HI>which has been passed on the</HI> Murderer, <HI>who is this day to be</HI> Executed. <HI>There</HI> is a man standing before the Lord, and among His people this day, who has done <HI>just</HI> as my Text expresseth, he hath <HI>smitten</HI> his Neighbour, and that <HI>with an Instru∣ment of lorn</HI> too, with a cruel <HI>Spit</HI> made of <HI>Iron;</HI> the thing proved by several Witnesses, and the man that was hurt <HI>dyed</HI> of <HI>that</HI> wound, therfore he that has smitten him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Murderer,</HI> and must surely be put to death. Tho' for a long time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e denied it, nevertheless since his Condemna∣tion he has acknowledged it; and yesterday he confessed to me, that he had in his Rage mur∣dered the man, whose death and blood has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in
<PB N="15" REF="000432_0018_0FA5B31B0BBEDDD0"/>
said to his Charge; he told me that the other gave him some ill language whereby he was provoked, and that he said to him, <HI>if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> within the</HI> door, <HI>he would run the</HI> Spit <HI>into his Bow∣els;</HI> and he <HI>was</HI> as wicked as he <HI>said</HI> he would be, so that he is <HI>guilty of Murder.</HI> Therefore none ought to blame Those in Authority for causing the Murderer to <HI>be put to death;</HI> Consci∣ence to <HI>God,</HI> &amp; to the <HI>People</HI> under their Charge, and to their own Souls also, has <HI>necessitated</HI> them to do what they have done in this matter. Let every one remember that Scripture, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 17. <HI>A man that doth violence to the</HI> blood <HI>of any person, shall flee to the</HI> Pit, <HI>let</HI> no <HI>man</HI> stay <HI>him;</HI> if he has <HI>shed blood,</HI> to the Pit let him go, and <HI>flee</HI> thither; let all convenient <HI>Speed</HI> be used in the Execution of Justice, that so the Land may be cleared from blood, and let no man in Authori∣ty <HI>stay</HI> him, let no private person <HI>solicit</HI> for him. But let us be <HI>thankful</HI> to God, that we are under <HI>such</HI> Magistrates as will <HI>do Justice,</HI> and <HI>Execute Judgment,</HI> &amp; punish Sin according as the Word of God requires that it should be done.</P>
<P>Infor. 2. <HI>Hence,</HI> Those <HI>Things which have a tendency to, and a degree</HI> of Murder <HI>in them, must needs be evil. e.g.</HI> Rash sinful <HI>Anger</HI> is an evil thing, Murder <HI>begins</HI> there.

<PB N="23" REF="000432_0026_0FA5B32666120860"/>
whereby I have offended the great God; one is that Sin of</HI> Drunkenness, <HI>which has caused me to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our many</HI> other <HI>Sins; for when in Drink, I have been often guilty of</HI> Cursing <HI>and</HI> Swearing, <HI>and quarrelling▪ and striking others: But</HI> the <HI>Sin which lies</HI> most heavy <HI>upon my Conscience, is,</HI> that I have despised the Word of God, <HI>and many a time</HI> refused to hear it preached. <HI>For these things, I be∣leeve God has left me to that, which has brought me to a shameful</HI> &amp; <HI>miserable death. I do therefore beseech &amp; warn all persons,</HI> young <HI>men</HI> especially <HI>to take heed of these Sins, lest they provoke the Lord to do to them as He has justly done by me. And for the further peace of my own Conscience, I think my self obliged to add this unto my foregoing Confession, That</HI> I own <HI>the</HI> Sentence <HI>which the</HI> Honoured Court <HI>has</HI> pass'd upon me, <HI>to be exceeding</HI> just; <HI>in as much as (tho I had no</HI> former Grudge <HI>and Malice against the man whom I have killed, yet) my Passion at the time of the Fact was so out-ragious, as that it hurried me on to the doing of that which makes me justly now proceeded against as a Murderer.</HI></P>
<P>Thus does this miserable man confess. But how many are there in the Congregation, that this may strike <HI>terror</HI> &amp; <HI>trembling</HI> into <HI>their</HI> souls!</P>

that the Terrors of God have awakned his soul, bitterly complains of <HI>two</HI> Sins especially; one is that of <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> And indeed, <HI>Drunkenness</HI> has bin a <HI>bloody</HI> sin; it has bin the cause of ma∣ny a Murder. The man here, who is now <HI>flying to the Pit,</HI> confesseth▪ that in his Drink, he was wont to Curse &amp; Swear, and to quarrel, and strike those near him; and he acknowledged to me, that he had made himself grievously drunk the day before he was left of God to commit the Murder which he now must dye for; yea, and that he had <HI>that</HI> very night bin drinking to excess, and that he was not clear of drink at the time when he did the bloody Fact. And does not the Scripture say, <HI>Who has wo, who has sorrow, who has contentions, who has babling, who has Rounds without cause? They that tarry long at the</HI> Wine—<HI>&amp;c.

O how many have by means of this sin▪ been guilty of <HI>Interpretative Murder!</HI> They have caused others to dye by making them drunk. There has been an horrible thing done in this place; some wicked persons (who they are God knows) have given or sold <HI>strong Liquor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and made them drunk also, and several of them have dyed in that con∣dition
<PB N="25" REF="000432_0028_0FA5B327E7C82C70"/>
Let such know▪ that the Lord will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udg them; yea, He will judg 'em as Men that have <HI>shed blood</HI> shall be judged; they must an∣swer for the blood of Souls and Bodyes too.

It's a very sad thing, that so many Bodyes &amp; Souls should be eternally ruin'd, and no help for it. How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew are there, that if once they be addicted to <HI>this</HI> vice, do ever <HI>truly</HI> repent <HI>of</HI> it or turn <HI>from</HI> it.

There was a Man, who hearing that his So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> took evil courses, and that he followed such a vice, well, (said he) I hope he'll leave that and that he was given to another vice, I hope (said he) he'll leave <HI>that</HI> too; but it was told him that his Son was given to <HI>Drunkenness</HI> also Nay, then (said he) <HI>I have no hope of him▪</HI> I will not say (as he did) There is no hope that ever a Drunkard should <HI>repent▪</HI> but I say, there have been but <HI>few</HI> such Instances in the world. How rarely have any of you known a man that has been addicted to this Body-destroying, and Soul-murdering Iniquity, that has truly repen∣ted <HI>of</HI> it, or turned <HI>from</HI> it again! O then, Let Men that have any love for their Lives on Souls, beware of this bloody Sin.</P>
<P>But the other Evil which this undone Man does especially cry out of, and which (now that he seeth his Soul going into <HI>Eternity</HI>) he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, lies <HI>most heavy</HI> upon his Conscience, is his <HI>Despising the Word of God.</HI> I do not wonder to hear him speak so, for I have known several Condemned persons, who have made the same out-cry: <HI>O nothing terrifies our Consciences like the thought of</HI> This, <HI>that we have</HI> neglected <HI>the Means of grace;</HI> And what think you of Sin∣ners in Hell, who are wayling for this with tears of blood for ever &amp; ever? whose doleful and bitter cry, is, <HI>O the Sermons which we once heard▪</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might have <HI>heard but</HI> would not! <HI>Ten

Thousand worlds would we give for an</HI> opportuni∣ty <HI>to hear one of those Sermons again, with any hope of</HI> finding Mercy <HI>with God.</HI> O you that have lived under the Gospel, but despised it, think of this. Verily I say unto you, <HI>all</HI> the sins in the world will not damn like this: Suppose a man to have bin guilty of Adultry, or Murder, or the most horrid Transgressions against the Law of God, these will not damn his Soul like that of <HI>Despising</HI> the Word of God. <HI>For this is</HI> the <HI>Condemnation, that</HI> Light <HI>is come into the world, and men love</HI> Darkness <HI>rather than Light.</HI> And <HI>How shall we escape, if we</HI> neglect so great <HI>Salva∣tion?</HI> They that shall be found guilty of neg∣lecting the great Salvation offered in the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> cannot escape the wrath of God, to the ut∣most of it. And this is true, not only concern∣ing such as have lived under the constant Preaching of the Gospel, and yet remain, and live &amp; dye in a natural unconverted estate; but of them also that <HI>might</HI> hear the Word of God but <HI>will not:</HI> concerning <HI>Such,</HI> Christ saith, <HI>It shall be more tolerable for</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>at the day of Judgment, than for</HI> them. <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 15.

<PB N="28" REF="000432_0031_0FA5B32A903FDDC8"/>
was wont (as himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith) on Sabbath-Days, to go out into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and there to profane the Lords Dayes, at the very time when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might and ought to have him hearing the Word of God: and since he had a Family, his custom was to keep at home, when others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attend∣ing the publick Worship of God. And he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old me, that he did foolishly please himself in think∣ing that he had sufficient reason to stay at <HI>home,</HI> because he had not clothes <HI>good enough</HI> to appear publickly in; whenas the mony that he mis∣spent in <HI>drink</HI> would have procur'd him <HI>Cloathe∣ing.</HI> Let others then by his Example be warn∣ed against this evil left they provoke God, and feel sorrow for it, as he has done. I doubt there are very many in this great Town, guilty of his sin in this particular, perhaps some▪ that are professors of <HI>Religion,</HI> which is dreadful to think on. I hear some say▪ that there are many Hun∣dreds, nay, some <HI>Thousands</HI> in this place, that seldom hear a Sermon preached, from one end of the year to the other: if that be so, it is ve∣ry lamentable. What is like to become of the souls of such profane persons? If they that are in place of power (be they Superior or Inferi∣or Officers) can possibly redress this evil, they will certainly do a Service acceptable to GOD and to our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</P>

<P>It is a very pretions Repast, which is thus brought unto you, O immortal Souls!

<P N="1">1. That, to <HI>Believe</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ▪ is to <HI>Look unto Him for Salvation.</HI> These bless∣ed things are <HI>equivalent</HI> each to the other; and herein, we have both the <HI>Act</HI> of Faith, and the <HI>End</HI> of Faith: fairly suggested unto us.</P>

<P>There is indeed a 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old <HI>Look,</HI> which the be∣leeving Soul in its Agonies does give towards the Lord Jesus Christ.

<P><HI>How shall I look unto Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P>About this there are a few <HI>Directions</HI> to be given.</P>
<P><HI>O set your</HI> hearts <HI>unto the words that shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣stified among you, for they are not vain things;</HI> your very lives, yea the lives of your souls are con∣cerned in them.</P>

the <HI>stings</HI> which the <HI>infernal</HI> vipers do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your souls withal; there is a <HI>Set</HI>-work of this nature to be solemnly performed both by them whose▪ <HI>died eyes</HI> never yet look'd to Jesus Christ, &amp; by them whose <HI>dimeyes</HI> have cause enough to <HI>continue looking</HI> unto <HI>him</HI> whom they have already seen.</P>
<P>Now there are Two things to be premised concerning this. Let this be the 1<HI>st.</HI> premised.</P>
<P>It is highly expedient that you should speedily <HI>set apart</HI> a time to <HI>make attempts</HI> about the grand work of <HI>Looking unto Jesus Christ.</HI> It is indeed true, that an unbeliever hath no other Assure∣ance of prospering in his Essayes to break the iron Prison doors of his unbelief, but such an <HI>Who can tell?</HI> such an <HI>Who knowes</HI> such an <HI>It may it,</HI> as the Prophets of old were wont much to insist upon. If you set your selvs to believe in your <HI>own</HI> strength, the Faith of <HI>Simon Magus</HI> is all you are like to attain unto. Yet you may be quickned to do what you <HI>can,</HI> from the renown∣ed History of the man with the <HI>withred hand</HI> in <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. 13. unto whom <HI>Jesus</HI> saying, <HI>stretch forth thy hand;</HI> he tryed to do it without any de∣murr at the seeming unsuitableness of the Injur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, and <HI>Behold he stretched it forth and it was</HI> restored.</P>
<P>Let this be <HI>next</HI> premised. It is extreamly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> that this rare work of <HI>Looking unto Jesus Christ</HI> should be often <HI>renewed.</HI> Sometimes per∣haps the spirit of <HI>jealousy</HI> will come upon you, you will be fearing, <HI>Alas, I did never yet</HI> aright

And O remem∣ber, that to do this work <HI>often,</HI> over &amp; over <HI>again,</HI> is a thing than which nothing can more tend to your Victory over all the Adversaries of your endless Welfare. Yea, sometimes if an Half or a Whole of a day, were purposely laid out i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, this work, the time will be found not to have bin lost when Eternity shall dawn upon the world. Hence in 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 4. they who have al∣ready <HI>tasted the grace</HI> of Jesus Christ are bid still to <HI>come unto him.</HI> [Some of us before the sands of another hour be run out, shall so meet with this <HI>King of glory</HI> in his <HI>Galleries</HI> that we may have a special opportunity to catch hold on the feet of the Lord who deigns to <HI>sup</HI> with us, and like <HI>Mary</HI> cry <HI>my Lord, my Lord</HI> until we have <HI>renewed</HI> the Looks that have hitherto <HI>kept ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> souls in life.</HI> O be you thankful for this, and <HI>do with your might what your hands find to do.</HI>]</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Hear and your soul shall live.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that you would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abour in a <HI>wise</HI> Retirement to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t up the woful eyes of your Hell-stung souls toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> after <HI>such</HI> a manner.</P>

There are then 2 or 3 savory Meditations, to which if you should give a <HI>time</HI> and <HI>room,</HI> you may hereafter reap the comfort of it. I perceive in <HI>Hos.</HI> 14. 2. and elsewhere, that the prophets would some∣times put <HI>words</HI> into the <HI>mouths</HI> of <HI>them</HI> that they were travelling for the Salvation of: Some∣thing of that kind shal now be done by the <HI>bring∣ing</HI> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>thoughts</HI> into your mind which may▪ comport with the <HI>Invitations</HI> of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Let your first Head of Meditation be an <HI>I Must</HI> Think with your selves, <HI>I must</HI> look unto Jesus Christ.

<HI>If thou</HI> warn <HI>the wicked of his way to turn from it, if he do not turn from his way,</HI> he <HI>shall dy in his iniquity, but thou shalt deliver thy soul.</HI></Q>

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>I<HI>T was the Motion of many, and the Importunity of some that drew from me my consent to make this (al∣most extemporary) discourse thus public. The Priso∣ner sent to me on the</HI> After-noon <HI>before the Sabbath, a writing under his hand, wherein he own'd the Justice of God in bringing him to this untimely End, and the Righteousness of the Sentence of</HI> Man <HI>upon him▪ toge∣ther with a Confession of those sins that he had lived in all his dayes, of which there is something spoken in the Sequel: adding</HI> 2 <HI>Requests,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that I would take some</HI> Notice <HI>of</HI> him <HI>in my Sermon, and that I would give</HI> warning <HI>to those of his</HI> Fellow-<HI>Siners that had been guilty of the like evils, left they also become like monuments of divine Justice. Such reasonable requests especially from a</HI> dying man <HI>I could not deny. My</HI> Subject <HI>that day was</HI> Isa. 12. 1. <HI>and my Business at that time to discourse of the necessity, means &amp; marks of the turning away of God's</HI> Anger, <HI>which I judged not unsutable for a person in his condition; according∣ly did, as there was occasion, apply my self particularly to</HI> him <HI>in my Sermon, which is not so proper to insert here, What was directly spoken to himself, or to others at his desire, so far at least as my memory would serve me, is committed to the Press, and added as an Appendix to those more studied sermons which the Lord put into the heart of other of His Servants to</HI> preac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>for his sake that is</HI> gone, <HI>and</HI> publish <HI>for the good of</HI> others <HI>that</HI> survive. <HI>The good Lord follow the whole with his blessing, and grant that</HI> all Israel <HI>may</HI> hear &amp; fear, <HI>so that there may no more such great wic∣kedness be done in this our Land.</HI></P>

<P>WHat I have to say to the poor condem∣ned Prisoner shall be under these <HI>Two</HI> Heads: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Something▪ 1. By way of <HI>Convicti∣on</HI> and <HI>Awakning.</HI> 2.

I speak not this to <HI>upraid</HI> you but further to <HI>humble</HI> you, and withal to tell you, that <HI>you glorify</HI> God <HI>by this</HI> Confession. <HI>Thus</HI> you say you have <HI>liv'd,</HI> and <HI>these</HI> sins you <HI>traded</HI> in, till now at last the Lord has lest you to commit that <HI>great</HI> &amp; horrendous Sin of <HI>Murder,</HI> in the doing of which you have even <HI>fill'd up your measure,</HI> and all the rest of your sins do in this one sin <HI>find you out</HI> and light up∣on you.

You have heard something e'en how of the nature of God's Anger, but who knowes the <HI>Power</HI> of it. <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. 11. And <HI>you</HI> are the person against whom this inconceiveable Anger is enkindled; O let this word sink down into the bottom of thy Heart, and <HI>pierce</HI> thy very soul.

<HI>Murder,</HI> for which there is no <HI>expiation</HI> but by the <HI>death</HI> of the Murderer; whereof that Reason is given <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. 1. because <HI>man</HI> was <HI>made</HI> in <HI>God's Image,</HI> so that the Killing of a <HI>man</HI> is the De∣stroying of the <HI>image</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Murder is a fill against the light of Nature; and so hainous that the <HI>Barbarians</HI> who had <HI>no</HI> knowledg of the true God, yet concluded that <HI>Vengeance</HI> followed the Murderer up and down, so that tho' he may es∣cape for a while, however at length it would not suffer him to live. <HI>Act.</HI> 28. 4. Know then that this is the <HI>main</HI> thing thou hast to think on, this is the most terrible thing before thee, not so much the <HI>pain</HI> or <HI>shame</HI> of the death thou art speedily to undergoe, as the <HI>Anger</HI> of God that comes with it. This is the great Concernment of every man at all times, and of <HI>thee</HI> princi∣pally at <HI>this</HI> time: How stand matters between God and <HI>thee?</HI> how is He affected, is He an∣gry or pleased? Why, I tell thee, That God whose favour is <HI>life,</HI> and whose Wrath is <HI>Death, He</HI> is angry with thee.

The <HI>Devils believe</HI> that there is a God <HI>and tremble,</HI> Jam. 2. 16. do thou believe that, and further that God is <HI>angry</HI> with thee, and tremble at it.</P>

cannot bent. The Creation groans under you is a common Enemy to mankind, and one who by the positive and indispensable Command of God must <HI>fly to the pit and no man</HI> must <HI>stay you,</HI> Prov. 28. 17. This is the Decree of God, and the righteous Sentence of man concerning you.</P>
<P>You are yet but a young man, and accord∣ing to ordinary course might have lived many years in this world, had not your over-much <HI>Wickedness</HI> brought you to <HI>dy before</HI> your <HI>time,</HI> as <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7. 17.

Also before your time which probably you had lotted on, and which men too often do promise themselvs. Such as upon any awake∣nings of Conscience and Calls to Repentance, delay &amp; put it off while in their Youth, it is up∣on a promise of repenting when they are old, and how many in that sense <HI>die before</HI> their <HI>time!</HI></P>
<P>And here for your further awakning, observe the Lord in his Providence making good ano∣ther dreadful word upon you, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and deceitful men shall not live out <HI>half</HI> their dayes, <HI>Psal.</HI> 55. 23. Thus you are a son of Death. God and man have said to thee, Oh wicked man, <HI>thou shalt surely dye.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Your time is numbred and almost <HI>finished.</HI> Indeed God has numbred all our times &amp; Years

You are just now upon the very brink of the Pit, the Grave is ready for you, upon the very <HI>Edge</HI> of <HI>Eternity</HI> are you (I say eminently <HI>you</HI>) now walking, &amp; will be within the <HI>line</HI> of it very speedily.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> could say, when a few <HI>years</HI> are come, then <HI>I</HI> shall go the way whence I shall not return, <HI>Cap.</HI> 16. 22. But <HI>you</HI> may say, Before 4 <HI>dayes</HI> are come &amp; gone, I shall be gone to the place from whence I shall not return till the very heavens be no more.

<P>But for <HI>your</HI> part, <HI>you</HI> have your <HI>bounds set,</HI> &amp; told you, beyond which you cannot pass; you know at the utmost the Date of your life, and Day of your <HI>Death,</HI> you may die <HI>sooner,</HI> but you must not live <HI>longer,</HI> your end is in your view, you have but a few steps thither, and had not need take any <HI>vain,</HI> unprofitable or <HI>false</HI> ones.</P>
<P>You seem to bewail your sin of <HI>Sabbath-break∣ing,</HI> well, know that you shall never have an∣other Sabbath to break.—The Lord help you to keep <HI>this</HI> as you ought. I cannot pass this particular without once more commending it to your serious Consideration; O chew upon it, dwell upon it, that <HI>a few hours hence you shall cir∣tainly dye.</HI> It's a very awful thing to us to look upon you, a person in your Youth, Health, and Strength, <HI>Breasts full of milk,</HI> and <HI>Bones moistned with marrrow</HI> and then to think that within so many daies this man, tho' in his full Strength must dy: and methinks it should be much more awful to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Your <HI>Death</HI> will not <HI>expiate</HI> your <HI>Offence</HI> in the sight of God, nor cause the <HI>Turning away of His Anger from you:</HI> Its true the <HI>shedding of your bloud</HI> will take away, the Sin from the <HI>Land</HI> that it shall not ly there, else innocent bloud

should be imputed to the Land; but this does nothing towards the Satisfaction of <HI>Gods Justice</HI> In order to the Removal of his wrath from the <HI>Murderer.</HI> Punishment makes no amends for Sin, unless it be that which was inflicted upon <HI>Christ</HI> as he stood in the capacity of a Surety in behalf of the Elect, and so bare both their sin and their punishment, but otherwise <HI>Hell</HI> torments don't satisfy God's Justice nor quench the fire of his wrath, muchless can any bodily suffering do it, tho it be the <HI>highest,</HI> even <HI>death</HI> it self. Do not then deceive your self; Say not I have sinned, its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but am now to suffer the Law, and <HI>that</HI> being undergone I shall then be quitt. It is so indeed as to any thing that <HI>men</HI> can do to thee, but thy death does not at all deliver thee out of the hands of <HI>Divine</HI> Justice. Nay rather <HI>Sixthty,</HI></P>
<P>If you get not this Sin and all the rest of your sins done away, and so the Anger of God remo∣ved, your approaching Death will be but the beginning of Sorrows to you. However sensu∣ally or like a Beast (or worse) you have <HI>lived,</HI> you shall not <HI>dye</HI> as Beasts dye, so as that there shall be an end of you and all your sufferings together: No, no such matter.

<P>And if the Lord help thee <HI>now</HI> to <HI>believe,</HI> i. e. to <HI>receive</HI> and <HI>take up</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> as thy <HI>Lord &amp; Saviour,</HI> thou shalt <HI>give glory to God</HI> by <HI>believing,</HI> and the Lord will account Himself, by the <HI>righ∣teousness</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> which by Faith thou laidst hold on, <HI>abundantly satisfyed</HI> for all the Disho∣nour thou hast done to Him all thy dayes.</P>

and therefore to be testifyed against. It was that Sin which brought <HI>Israel</HI> of old unto Deso∣lation. Hear <HI>this</HI> person telling you that he feels this sin now lying as an insupportable load up∣on him.

See that you set a good example, and require all that are under your shaddow to immitate you,</P>
<P>Whether there be any other present that are guilty of the the sin of <HI>Murder</HI> God knowes.

Otherwise be assur'd that you are but <HI>re∣served</HI> to be punished, if not in <HI>this</HI> world, as u∣sually such sinners are, yet in the world <HI>to come.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude in a few words more to <HI>this</HI> Bloody Sinner.</P>
<P>Consider, that all who live under the Gospel, are brought to Jesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant, and to the blood of <HI>sprinkling,</HI> that speaks <HI>better</HI> things than that of <HI>Abel,</HI> Heb. 12. 24. And thereupon its presently added <HI>ver.</HI> 25. <HI>see that ye refuse not him that speakes from</HI> Hea∣ven. <HI>Abels</HI> blood cryed for <HI>Vengeance</HI> upon the Murderer, but <HI>Christ</HI>'s blood cries for <HI>Pardon:</HI> and Christ <HI>Himself</HI> calls on thee to receive &amp; not refuse Him; unto which Call if thou yeild the Obedience of Faith, His blood will speak on thy behalf. Thy <HI>Sins</HI> speak bitter things against thee, old sins, sins of youth, a Course of sin, and this <HI>bloody</HI> sin cries aloud &amp; <HI>speaks</HI> most <HI>bitterly,</HI> but that blood of <HI>Christ</HI> can out-speak, <HI>out</HI>-cry all these. It was from Hence that <HI>Da∣vid</HI> when under the Anguish of soul for his Blood-Guiltiness, expected pardon and <HI>had</HI> it, and so mayst thou, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.</P>
<P>Let thy heart leap to hear such Language of this blood. Goe thy way and spend that little time that is left thee in studying the Vileness of thy sins committed, &amp; the Misery unto which
<PB N="113" REF="000432_0116_0FA5B46A6913A7D0"/>
thou art thereby exposed, together with the Ex∣cellence and Preciousness of Jesus Christ, and Him crucified, who is ready to save thee from Sin present and wrath to come. And tho' thou art not able to come, yet the glorious lifting up of Christ in the Gospel, together with the ge∣neral Invitation unto all that need Him, are the means appointed &amp; blest by God to draw Men to come.</P>
<P>Christ would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain have the Honour of saving such a wretched Sinner as thou art, and be thou well assured that unless thou add unto that Sin of shedding of Man's Blood, the guilt of Refu∣sing and Slighting of Christ's Blood, thou shalt not perish.</P>
<P>All the sins that ever thou hast committed shall not damn thee, unless thou add Unbelief to all the rest, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the wilful rejecting of a tendered Saviour. There is Wrath on thee, but it shall not be Everlastingly upon thee, if thou Believe; it is Unbelief only that makes Wrath abide, (<HI>Joh.</HI> 3. <HI>ult.</HI>) other Sins do dis∣please, but <HI>this</HI> only can destroy.</P>
<P>Look up to Him for the gift of Faith.</P>
<P>The good Lord open thine Ear, that thou may'st be no longer rebellious, but help thee <HI>so</HI> to hear as that thy Soul may live.</P>

<P><HI>Mor.</HI> I don't know well what to say, but <HI>this</HI> I hope is a good sign, I have lived in many grieve∣ous sins, in <HI>Lying, Drinking, Sabbath-breaking</HI> &amp; evil <HI>Company-keeping;</HI> God has made <HI>now</HI> these so <HI>bitter</HI> to my soul, that I would not commit them <HI>again,</HI> might I have <HI>my life this afternoon by doing it.</HI></P>

<P>Min. <HI>And</HI> all <HI>these</HI> 30 <HI>years have you been sinning against the holy God. Ever since you knew how to do</HI> any <HI>thing, you have every day bin guilty of innume∣rable sins: you deserve the dreadful wrath</HI> &amp; <HI>curse of the infinite God. But God has brought you here, to a place where you have enjoy'd the means of grace. And here you have added unto your</HI> old <HI>Sins, most fearful Iniquityes: you have bin such a matchless, prodigious Transgressor, that you are now to</HI> dye <HI>by the stroke of civil Justice; to</HI> dy before your time, <HI>for</HI> being wicked over much. <HI>There is hardly any sort of Wickedness which you have not wallowed in-That sin particularly which you are now to die for, is a most</HI> monstrous <HI>Crime.

<P><HI>Mor.</HI> But is there not Mercy for me in Christ?</P>
<P>Min. <HI>Yes, and its a</HI> wonderful <HI>thing that I have now further to tell you: Mind, I entreat you.

<PB N="119" REF="000432_0122_0FA5B473C04C1C60"/>
liv'd righteously. <HI>He died at length a most</HI> cursed death, <HI>and this was that we might be able to say un∣to God,</HI> Lord, let not <HI>me die</HI> for sin, since thy <HI>Son</HI> has died in my room. <HI>This glorious Redeemer is now in the highest heaven, pleading with God for the Salvation of His chosen ones.—And He</HI> pours out his Spirit continually upon <HI>them</HI> that do <HI>believe</HI> on him: <HI>might</HI> you <HI>then be enabled by his</HI> grace <HI>to carry your poor, guilty, condemned, enslaved, ig∣norant</HI> soul <HI>unto</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>and humbly put your trust in him for deliverance from the</HI> whole <HI>bad state which you are</HI> brought into. <HI>Oh then his voice is to</HI> you <HI>the same that was to the penitent Thief,</HI> This day shalt thou be with me in <HI>Paradise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> Oh that <HI>I</HI> might be so! Sir I would hear more of <HI>these things:</HI> I think, I can't <HI>better fit</HI> my self for my <HI>death</HI> than by <HI>hearkning</HI> to <HI>these things.</HI></P>
<P>Min. <HI>Attend then: The</HI> never dying <HI>spirit that</HI> lodges <HI>within you, must</HI> now <HI>within a few</HI> minutes <HI>appear before the</HI> Tribunal <HI>of the Great</HI> GOD; <HI>in</HI> what, <HI>or in</HI> whose Righteousness <HI>will you then ap∣pear? will you have this to be your Plea,</HI> Lord, I ex∣perienced many good Motions &amp; Desires in my soul, &amp; many Sorrows for my <HI>sin</HI> before I dy'd: <HI>or will you expect to have</HI> no other <HI>Plea but</HI> This, Lord, <HI>I</HI> am <HI>vile,</HI> but thy Son is a <HI>Surety</HI> for the <HI>worst</HI> of <HI>sinners</HI> that <HI>believe</HI> in him; for <HI>his</HI> sake a∣lone, have MERCY on me.</P>

<P>Min. <HI>Truly you have cause to</HI> mourn <HI>for it. Secure the welfarre of your</HI> soul, <HI>and this (now)</HI> pinion'd, <HI>hang'd</HI> vile body of yours <HI>will shortly</HI> be raised <HI>un∣to glory,</HI> glory forevermore. <HI>And let me put you in mind of</HI> one thing <HI>more, I doubt you han't</HI> yet <HI>laid aside your</HI> unjust Grudges <HI>against the Persons concerned in</HI> your Conviction &amp; Condemnation: <HI>You have</HI> no <HI>cause to complain of them: and you are not fit to pray, much less are you fit to</HI> dye <HI>till you heartily wish them as well as</HI> your own soul: <HI>if you die</HI> malicious, <HI>you die</HI> miserable.</P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> I heartily wish them all <HI>well,</HI> I bear <HI>Ill-will</HI> to none—What a lamentable thing is <HI>this,</HI> Ah <HI>this</HI> is that which has brought me hither!</P>
<P>Min. <HI>What do you mean?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> I over-heard a man mocking &amp; scoffing at me when I <HI>stumbled</HI> just now, he does very ill. <HI>I</HI> have done so my <HI>self: I</HI> have mock'd &amp; scoff'd like that man, and see what it hath brought <HI>me</HI> to: <HI>he</HI> may come to the like.</P>
<P>Min. <HI>The</HI> Lord forgive <HI>that foolish hard-he. te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> creature. But be not</HI> too much <HI>disturbed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> Yonder! I am now come in sight of the <HI>place</HI> where I must <HI>immediately end</HI> my dayes. Oh what a huge Multitude of people is come toge∣ther on this occasion! O Lord, O Lord I pray
<PB N="122" REF="000432_0125_0FA5B477315BBE00"/>
thee to make my Death profitable to all this Multitude of People, that they may not <HI>sin</HI> a∣gainst thee as I have done!</P>
<P>Min. <HI>Amen, Amen</HI> ten thousand <HI>times; the Lord GOD Allmighty say Amen to this</HI> Prayer <HI>of yours! It would indeed be an excellent thing if you could now come to receive your death with some Sa∣tisfaction of</HI> soul <HI>in this thought, That</HI> Much Glo∣ry is like to come to God by it: <HI>I am verily per∣swaded God intends to</HI> do good <HI>to</HI> many souls <HI>by means of</HI> your Execution: <HI>This is a</HI> greater ho∣nour <HI>than you are worthy of.</HI></P>
<P>[After the Discourse had been intermitted about a <HI>minute or two by reason of the</HI> miery <HI>way</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> I beseech you Sir speak to me. Do me all the good you can: my time grows very short: your discourse <HI>sits</HI> me for my Death more than any thing.</P>
<P>Min. <HI>I'm sorry so small a thing as a</HI> plashy Street <HI>should make me loose one minute of this</HI> more-than-ordinary <HI>precious time: a few paces</HI> more <HI>bring you to the place which you have now in your</HI> eye, <HI>from whence you shall not</HI> come back alive. <HI>Do you find your self</HI> afraid to dy <HI>there?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> Sir, If it were not for the Condition that my SOUL must by &amp; by be in, I should not fear my death at <HI>all;</HI> but I have a little comfort from some of Gods promises about <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>Min. <HI>And what shall I now say? There are a∣mong
<PB N="123" REF="000432_0126_0FA5B4780BC66780"/>
the</HI> last words <HI>that I can have</HI> liberty <HI>to leave with you. Poor man, thou art now going to</HI> knock at the door <HI>of Heaven, and to beg &amp;</HI> cry, Lord, Lord open to me! <HI>The only way for thee to speed, is,</HI> to open the door of thy own soul now unto <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Do this, <HI>and thou shalt</HI> undoubtedly <HI>be admitted into</HI> the gloryes of His heavenly Kingdom: <HI>You shall fare as well as</HI> Manasseh <HI>did before you: leave this</HI> un<HI>done, and there's nothing remains for you but</HI> the Worm which dyeth not, <HI>and</HI> the fire which shall not be quenched.</P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> Sir, show me then <HI>again</HI> what I have to do.</P>
<P>Min. <HI>The voice, the sweet voice of the Lord Jesus Christ, (who was once</HI> hanged on a tree, <HI>to take away the</HI> Sting <HI>and</HI> Curse <HI>of even such a Death as</HI> yours) <HI>unto all that</HI> close <HI>with him, His heavenly voice now is,</HI> Oh that <HI>I</HI> &amp; my Saving work might be entertained, kindly entreated, in that poor, perishing soul of thine! <HI>Are you willing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Morg.</HI> I hope I am.</P>
<P>Min. <HI>His Voice further is,</HI> If <HI>I</HI> am lodged in thy soul <HI>I</HI>'ll sprinkle my blood upon it, and on <HI>my</HI> account thou shalt find Favour with GOD▪ <HI>Do you consent to this?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> This I want.</P>
<P>Min. <HI>But this is not</HI> all <HI>that he saith, His Voice further is,</HI> If <HI>I</HI> come into thy soul I will <HI>chang</HI> it, I will make all <HI>sin bitter</HI> to it, I will make it an holy heavenly soul. <HI>Do you value this above
<PB N="124" REF="000432_0127_0FA5B478DF9AE1A0"/>
the proffers of all the World?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mor.</HI> I think I doe,—and now, Sir, I must go no further, Look <HI>here</HI>—what a <HI>solemn sight</HI> is <HI>this!</HI> Here lyes the <HI>Coffin</HI> which this Body of mine must presently be laid in. I <HI>thank</HI> you dear Sir, for what you have already done for me.</P>
<P>Min. <HI>When you are gone up this Ladder, my last service for you before you are gone off will be to</HI> pray <HI>with you: But I would here take my leave of you. Oh that I might meet you at the right Hand of the LORD JESUS in the last Day! Farewel</HI> poor heart, <HI>Fare thee well.</HI> The everlasting Armes receive thee! The Lord JESUS, the merciful SAVIOUR of Souls take possession of thy Spi∣rit for himself. The Great GOD who is a <HI>great Forgiver,</HI> grant thee <HI>Repentance unto Life;</HI> and glorify himself in the Salvation of such a <HI>wounded</HI> soul as thine forever. <HI>With HIM, and with His free, rich, marvellous, infinite Grace, I leave you;</HI> Farewell.</P>
