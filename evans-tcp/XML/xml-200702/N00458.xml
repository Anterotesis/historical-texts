<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a vanity no less common than dan∣gerous, for such as enjoy the Gospel, and have a relation to the Visible Church, to <HI>boast themselves because of Gods Holy Mountain,</HI> as if they were therefore <HI>secure from all fear of evil:</HI> supposing that the Covenant will be their safety, and saying, <HI>though we walk in the imagination of our heart, no ill shall come upon us.</HI> The Design of this Discourse, is to undeceive such Enfatuated Souls, by let∣ting them see what ground they stand upon, and how <HI>dreadful the place</HI> is, in which they are. It is a singular favour of <HI>G</HI>od to be ta∣ken within the pale, and enjoy the benefit
<PB REF="000581_0003_0FA70FDA02423F40"/>
of the means of grace; but, as it may be abused, so their condition will be tremendous who shall at last fall under this guilt. That which first gave occasion to the Preaching of these Sermons, was the awful consideration of a Duty Ministerial, due to such as, being born of Professing Parents, having received the seal of <HI>G</HI>ods Covenant, and upon their asserting of this Covenant, and putting of themselves under the Discipline of Christ's Appointment, have been acknowledged, and admitted under our watch; and must there∣fore be accounted for in the great Day. The thought that these should perish at last, must needs be solemn. The hazzads which they lie exposed unto of so doing are amazing. To deny them their Title to, and inte∣rest in the Gospel priviledges, seems to be <HI>to bid them go and serve other Gods:</HI> The fear lest they should by the abuse of these ag∣gravate their guilt and misery, cannot but fill serious souls with great sollicitude: Their great addictedness to vanity, and the small discovery of their being in good earnest for Religion, looks portentously. The awful hand of God which is our against them in several terrible Judgments, is deeply affecting: and who that fears God would not do their ut∣most to pluck them out of the sire, and save them from burning? These therefore are firstly concerned in this Treatise; and it is

for that reason commended to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in spe∣cial, who are called upon to consider what terms they are upon with God, and invited with greatest solemnity to confer the rich opportunity they enjoy of obtaining Salvati∣on, with the danger of their incurring of <HI>double Damnation</HI> upon their neglect; and together with thankfulness for the <HI>price</HI> that is in their hands, to <HI>fear and tremble</HI> lest they should lose it, for <HI>want of an heart</HI> to im∣prove it. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet are others excluded; the Heart-searching God knows who they are, that have made the highest Profession, and are for all that unsound: and such are here told what they are to expect at the hands of a <HI>Jealous God.</HI> Let none be so uncharitable as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o suppose, that whilst we allow men their claim to the outward advantages of the Co∣venant, we indulge them in sin; the design is to improve it unto the more forcible per∣swading to diligence in securing their own salvation, and make them the more careful a∣bout it, because otherwise, the nearer to <HI>heaven</HI> they have been <HI>exalted,</HI> the deeper are they like to be detruded into <HI>Hell.</HI> God is wont to confer the Gospel upon men, and endow them with the liberties of it, not meerly because they are savingly converted, but that they may have the means so to be; and here they are upon termes with him, and stand Probationers for Eternal Life, or

<BIBL>Luke XIII. 6, 7, 8, 9.</BIBL>
<Q><P>He spake also this Parable: A certain man had a Fig-tree planted in his Vineyard, and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</P>
<P>Then said he to the Dresser of his Vineyard, behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none; cut it down why cumbereth it the ground.</P>
<P>And he answering said unto him, <HI>Lord,</HI> let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, &amp; dung it.</P>
<P>And if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after, that thou shalt cut it down.</P></Q>

<HEAD>SERMON I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occasion of this short and pithy Parable, is declared in the beginning of the Chapter. Our Saviour had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (C<HI>hap.</HI> 12.) Preaching a solemn Sermon in the Audience of a Multitude; and after it, some of the company make report to him, of a bloo∣dy act of <HI>Pilate</HI> upon some <HI>Galileans:</HI> he knowing their hearts, and perceiving what im∣provement they made of it, in censure and not

in self-application; reflecting upon themselves as being warned hereby: he therefore instructs them in the proper use which was to be made of that and such other <HI>Providences</HI> as sometimes fall out tacitly reprehending them for rash Judgment, in concluding those to have been unparallel'd Sinners: giving them to under∣stand, that in these ways of Divine Dispensati∣on, <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judgments of God were unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.</HI> That, though God sometimes makes some Sinners notable Exam∣ples of his awful Severity, even in this world; yet there are as bad as they, if not worse, spa∣red in the day of his Patience; and that there∣fore the best use <HI>the Living</HI> can make of such Exemplary Providences, is to consider them∣selves, fee how much they deserved it; that it was meer Sovereignty that made others and not them the Monuments of this Severity; that this was a loud call to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and if they did not improve it to that end, though they did now escape, yet <HI>Ruine</HI> and <HI>Destruction</HI> would ere-long fall upon them: and farther to set forth the great peril they were under, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>joyns this <HI>Parable.</HI> It was therefore nextly referred to the present state of the <HI>Jer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> to shew them upon what a precipice they then stood, and what danger they then lay open to, notwithstanding the present lenity they were partaker's in. But, because <HI>What is written, is written for our Instruction.</HI> There is a profita∣ble
<PB N="3" REF="000581_0008_0FA70FDF71ED1120"/>
Improvement to be made of it by us.</P>
<P>One Desig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Christ's Parables</HI> is, by cloa∣thing Spiritual Things with Earthly Language, to accommodate them the more to Humane Understandings, and to shew the rationality of them, by resembling them to such things as a∣mong men are accounted highly rational; and so to insinuate into the Affections.</P>
<P>The scope of this <HI>Parable</HI> is to shew what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the true and proper standing that men have in the <HI>Visible</HI> C<HI>hurch,</HI> under all the <HI>Priviledges</HI> therein conferred upon them. Men are apt to mistake themselves in this, and to grow secure, but Christ would have them to know the thing as it is. The Parable is only <HI>proposed,</HI> the <HI>Reddition</HI> is left to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Meditation, and is easily gathered from the occasion. The <HI>Application</HI> is nextly <HI>personal;</HI> for the design is to express the state of the <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> and not of the <HI>Vine∣yard.</HI></P>
<P>The principal heads to which the matter of the Parable may be reduced, are these:</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Subject</HI> about which it is spoken; <HI>A Fig-tree which a certain man had planted in his Vineyard, verse</HI> 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>barrenness</HI> of this Fig-tree taken no∣tice of particularly by the Owner, <HI>ibid. And he came,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>deliberation</HI> of the <HI>Owner</HI> with the <HI>Dresser</HI> about it, <HI>verse</HI>7. in which,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="000581_0009_0FA70FE035AB6528"/>
1▪ His <HI>Complaint</HI> against it; <HI>these three years,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Advice</HI> he gives to him that Dres∣sed it, C<HI>ut it down why cumbereth it the ground.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Intercession</HI> of the Dresser for the fig-tree, <HI>verse</HI> 8, 9.</P>
<P>These may be spoken to in their order; and several weighty and seasonable Observations may be made upon each of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The S<HI>ubject</HI> of which the <HI>Parable</HI> is spo∣ken: <HI>A certain man had a Fig-tree planted in his Vineyard.</HI> The Spiritual meaning of these Parabolical Expressions is to be enquired after: and here; What is meant by the <HI>certain man?</HI> What by the <HI>Vineyard?</HI> What by the <HI>Fig-tree?</HI> And what by its being <HI>planted in the Vineyard?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. By the <HI>Certain Man,</HI> is certainly intended <HI>God,</HI> being to deal with men as men, he re∣sembleth himself to a man; and it is not li∣mited to this or that man in particular, but expressed of any man, under such a respect; to shew that it is of universal consideration; and it is sure, that God not only challengeth a propriety in all the world as his; but more particularly in his Church, as standing under special relation to him: and therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. By the <HI>Vineyard</HI> we are to understand the <HI>Visible</HI> C<HI>hurch.</HI> It is not to be restrained to the Church of Gods Elect, and Effectually Called; for though his Elect do till Conversi∣on
<PB N="5" REF="000581_0010_0FA70FE0FB8A37D0"/>
abide unfruitful, yet all his called ones do bring forth fruit unto him; but here is a Tree in the Vineyard that bears none, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> supposed never so to do: I know <HI>Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> to favour his <HI>Arminian</HI> notions, interprets the <HI>Vineyard</HI> to mean the W<HI>orld,</HI> and the <HI>Fig-tree</HI> the Nation of the <HI>Jews;</HI> but, though a par∣ticular Church, is sometimes resembled by a Plant, as a <HI>Vine, Psal.</HI> 80. and an <HI>Olive, Rom.</HI> 11. and the Members of it to so many Branch∣es; yet the <HI>World</HI> is no where, that I know of, called in Scripture <HI>Gods Vineyard,</HI> but the <HI>Visi∣ble Church</HI> often, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. <HI>begin.</HI> 27.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the <HI>Fig-tree</HI> we are to understand <HI>par∣ticular Professors,</HI> that are related to the Visible Church; for <HI>Christ</HI> is here speaking to men personally, upon occasion of those persons who came to such untimely ends: and it is not un∣usual in Scripture, to express persons severally under the notion of Plants, see <HI>Psal.</HI> 52. 8.</P>
<P N="4">4. By its being <HI>Planted in the Vineyard,</HI> we are to conceive, mens enjoying of the <HI>Privi∣ledges</HI> and <HI>Benefits</HI> which are in the <HI>Visible Church,</HI> and Gods singular care expressed to them, in bestowing of these advantages on them; which, what they are, may be after considered.</P>
<P>I shall make some glances on this part of the Parable, it being introductory to the main Design in those things that follow.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000581_0011_0FA70FE1EA0D4DF8"/>
And there are two Observations here:</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE I. The Visible Church is Gods Vineyard.</HEAD>
<P>The Spirit of God is pleased very often to use this resemblance to express it by.</P>
<P>The word properly signifies a place where Vines are planted and husbanded: but in the common usage of it, is extended to a plat for Vines, Figs, and Olives, all of which they were wont of old to Plant in their Vineyards. Men were used to have their Vineyards, and so hath God His; that is his Visible Church: Here two things:</P>
<P N="1">1. In what respect it is resembled by a Vineyard?</P>
<P N="2">2. On what account it is said to be God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vineyard;</P>
<P N="1">1. In what respect it is resembled by a Vineyard?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To distinguish it from the rest of the World; which is therefore compared to a Wilderness, in Opposition to the Church: and hence all those things wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a difference between those two, and one is ren∣dred
<PB N="7" REF="000581_0012_0FA70FE56FAB3770"/>
in a better state than the other, are here to be considered: we may in particular referr to <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. 1, 2. where we have the principal things taken notice of, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. A vineyard is a S<HI>elect</HI>-Plat of ground taken off from that which is <HI>common,</HI> at the Choice of the owner. It is designed for a spe∣cial use, and therefore the prudence and pleasure of the Owner is employed in making choice where, and on what spot he will have it, and by this Choice it is separated from his Other Land, and devoted to such an use. Thus the <HI>Church</HI> is a particular Company of men, taken from the rest of the world, at the pleasure of <HI>G</HI>od, to be to him <HI>a peculi∣ar people.</HI> Though he is Lord of all the world yet he hath not as yet pleased to ex∣tend the bounds of his Church to all, but it is planted where and as he sees meet, Christ therefore assigns it to his meer pleasure, <HI>Math.</HI> 11. 25.</P>
<P N="2">2. Vineyards were wont to be planted on <HI>Fruitful Hills;</HI> so is the Church of God, <HI>Verse.</HI> 1. <HI>An Hill</HI> for it's Conspicuousness and pleasant S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituation, being for delight as well as profit: The Visible Church is to be <HI>Visible;</HI> they are, as it were, <HI>on an Hill,</HI> Mat. 5. 14. they are not to be ashamed of their Profession, but to own it openly and <HI>before men.</HI> And a Fertile Place, fit to produce profit to the Own∣er, suitable for the growth of Vines, and such
<PB N="8" REF="000581_0013_0FA70FE7968CACB0"/>
Plants as are to be planted in it. All places in the world, and all persons are in themselves alike capable of being spiritually fruitful; but where God plants his Church, he makes such places Fertile; and if there be any place where fruit is brought forth to his praise, it is there.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Vineyard is wont to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enced</HI> in for its preservation, and safety from damage: The barren Wilderness useth to be left open and common, for all manner of wild Beasts to range in, and feed upon; but a Vineyard is Fenced, <HI>verse</HI> 2. And as a Fence is to divide between that and the other ground, so to be a security to it, that Beasts may not come in and devour it; because so all the Industry and Cost of the Owner would be lost, and the Plants exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d to be trodden down and wast∣ed. Thus hath God made a Fence between his visible Church and the rest of the World; he hath set up a Wall or Hedg about it, to keep out such as are Enemies to him and his people; and carefully preserves is from mis∣chief: this respects the special Providence of God, or that care which he takes in looking after it, in being a <HI>Wall of Fire round about it.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. A Vineyard is wont to be planted with <HI>Select-Plants.</HI> In the Wilderness Plants grow of themselves; but in a Vineyard none are suffered, but such as are set by the Keeper at the pleasure of the Owner, and he is wont to make choice of such as are most likely and
<PB N="9" REF="000581_0014_0FA70FE94EC32CC0"/>
promising; and here the skill and choice of the Husbandman determines. There is a special Providence of God in bringing men into the visible Church, and giving them a Station there; he takes whom he will, and leaves whom he will; &amp; usually in the first Plantation of Churches, there are men eminent and desi∣rable, <HI>verse</HI> 2. <HI>He planted it with the choicest Vines,</HI> Jer. 2. 21. <HI>I planted thee a noble Vine.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Husbandman is wont to use greatest care and pains in Manuring of his Vineyard: and this is exprest, <HI>verse</HI> 2. <HI>He gathered out the</HI> S<HI>tones,</HI> &amp;c. and there are two things in it; a removing of all impediments, that would hin∣der the fertility of it, as throwing out stones, and weeding up such hurtful Plants, as are apt to spring up, shade the other, and eat out the heart of the Land; and the applying of all dunging digging and mending to it, that is accommodable to make it bear. Thus hath God been wont in his visible Church, to give them all helps and advantages in Ordinances &amp; Providences to further &amp; encourage them in Holiness, and Godly Conversation: there are no prudent courses omitted or neglected: He therefore calls them to judge in this Affair, <HI>verse</HI> 4.</P>
<P N="6">6. Vineyards were wont to have <HI>Towers</HI> built in them, <HI>Verse.</HI> 2. They were in dan∣ger of being Robbed, and for that Reason they set a Watch-house in the midst of them,
<PB N="10" REF="000581_0015_0FA70FE9F8C21B08"/>
where they kept some or other to have in∣spection of the Vineyard, and secure it from Thieves: This points to Gods special Care of, and Vigilant Providence over his Church, looking after it, that it be kept from the in∣roads of such as would be willing to do mis∣chief in it: thus we have Gods declaring his care in this respect, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27. 2. for this cause all such as <HI>Devour it,</HI> are said <HI>to offend, Jer.</HI> 2. 3.</P>
<P N="7">7. They used also to have a <HI>Wine-Press</HI> placed in the Vineyard, <HI>Verse.</HI> 2. And the use of it was to Tread the Grapes in, and press out the juice of them, and so Pre∣pare the Wine to be drunk; for both the Fat and the Press are Comprehended in this word. This word, [<HI>Winepress</HI>] is in Scrip∣ture used <HI>Metaphorically</HI> for Gods Judgments upon his enemies and the afflictions that he brings upon his people, and for the sufferings of Christ: Properly it was an instrument of preparing the fruit for some noble Service; and it notes to us all the helps which God af∣fords to his People in his Church, for their faithful serving him, and making their Obedi∣ence acceptable to him: and here the Suffer∣ings of Christ challenge the first place, without which we could not be accepted; though all other helps to both Faith and Obedience are also comprehended.</P>
<P N="8">8. Vineyard is planted with a <HI>Design</HI> of
<PB N="11" REF="000581_0016_0FA70FEAB59CF5D8"/>
the Owners <HI>Profit,</HI> All wise Agents design something in what they do: no man plants a vineyard, but he would eat and drink of the fruits of it; it is therefore with this expecta∣tion that he is at the cost and labour with it; and so God <HI>looked that his Vineyard should yield grapes, verse</HI> 2. This is spoken after the manner of men; God knows what every one will do: but it is rational to expect in the ordinary course, that a vineyard, well manu∣red, will answer the Owners design; and why should not the visible Church do so, in respect of God, who hath been at as much expence upon them?</P>
<P N="9">9. All Plants in a vineyard do not <HI>answer</HI> the Owners <HI>end</HI> and <HI>expectation.</HI> There are some that bear no fruit at all, others that de∣generate, and their fruit is sower, and not fit for the use for which it was planted; al∣though some other improvement may possibly he made of it: and all that are in the visible Church, do not answer the husbandry that hath been laid out upon them. As there are fruitless branches in a vine, so there are fruit∣less fig-trees in a vineyard, that do just con∣trary to expectation, <HI>verse</HI> 2. but this will come in an after consideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. On what account the visible Church is said to be Gods Vineyard?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not only on a general account, as the whole Creation is called his, but upon more
<PB N="12" REF="000581_0017_0FA70FEB80DCDB10"/>
special and peculiar reasons, it is to be acknow¦ledged for his propriety, and that more espe∣cially.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because he hath <HI>done</HI> all that for it where▪ by it is made a vineyard, it is all <HI>his doing;</HI> he planted, he fenced it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the cost and la∣bour which hath been laid out upon it is his charge: God tells them that he <HI>planted</HI> them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 21. and whom shall the vineyard call Master, but him who made it so? all the World lay in common, all mankind were a∣like by their Apostasy, and God was under no obligation to them, or necessity lying on him to extend this favour to any, or to these more than others, to bring them into such an estate as that, but he, <HI>of his good pleasure,</HI> because he had a mind <HI>to make them his people,</HI> dealt thus with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the visible Church, and they that are in it, are by <HI>Profession</HI> devoted to him. There is an outward Sanctification, or Consecration of them to the Service of God: They do by Covenant, declare that they are none of their own but his. This properly be∣longs to the Profession of Christians, and they that deny it, deny themselves to be such: they say they are Gods propriety, and have given themselves up to him and his Service. Every time they renew their Covenant, they anew assert it: this is their plea with God in trouble, <HI>Jer.</HI> 14. 9. <HI>We are called by thy Name.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="000581_0018_0FA70FEC2D9F2F18"/>
3. Because he expects more <HI>Service and glo∣ry</HI> from these than from other men, He will be glorified in all men; but he looks that these should <HI>glorifie him:</HI> he requires it, waits for it, and will be very angry at them if they do not pay it him. He reckons that all which he hath done for them more than others, should engage them to love him more than they do, and to endeavour to bring forth <HI>much fruit,</HI> whereby he may be <HI>glorified,</HI> Joh. 15. 8. and if they fall short here, they frust∣rate these expectations, <HI>i. e.</HI> they come behind of what in reason was to have been expected of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because all the <HI>profit</HI> of the vineyard be∣longs to him. Who is the Owner but he who receives the Rent of the vineyard; or he unto whom it is in Justice due? It is true, <HI>G</HI>od is not profited as to his eternal glory, by the best Services of any of his Creatures; but his <HI>Declarative Glory</HI> is in this way advanced, his Church therefore are peculiarly said to be to him <HI>for a name, and for a praise, Jer.</HI> 13. 17.</P>

His Vineyard lay open till he fenced it off, and had done so still, if he had not done it: are any place or people made to enjoy the Gos∣pel and means of Grace? they are of Gods providing and bestowing; and that these are preserved to them in despight of all the ma∣lice of Satan, and rage of ungodly men, is be∣cause God is concerned for and looks after this Vineyard of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yea, that there is a vi∣sible Church at this day in the World, and it is not long ago extinct, no thank to the e∣nemy, nor to the people of God themselves, but to him; they may sing after the Psalmist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 124. begin. <HI>Had not the Lord been on our side,</HI> &amp;c. nor is it any deserving of theirs, who have often provoked him to lay them o∣pen; but only because they are his, <HI>and it hath pleased him to make them his people,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. 22.</P>

2. That God is to be <HI>seen</HI> and <HI>adored</HI> in all the <HI>Tribulations</HI> that come upon his Church at any time. Is it his vineyard? then certainly there can be no breach made in its hedge, no beast of prey get into it to devour, nor inroads be made upon it, but by his permission, and over-ruling Hand; and when it is so, it is a witness of his displeasure; it faith there is some fault that he finds with it, that it doth not answer his expectation; that its returns have not been according to the improvement: they are therefore to look beyond instruments; yea his Church do acknowledge his anger in it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 80. 18. and this tells us what is the duty incumbent on the people of God, when at any time it is so, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to fall down penitently be∣fore him, to confess our unfruitfulness, and beg his mercy, and amendment of us; and in this way to wait for his return again to his vineyard.</P>
<P N="3">3. How <HI>dangerous</HI> it is for any to go about to <HI>harm</HI> the Church. All the damage, mis∣chief, st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy that is done to the vineyard falls upon the Owner; he looks upon himself as touched in it, and thereupon concerned to sue for reparation: God accounts that <HI>they who touch his people, touch the apple of his eye,</HI> and therefore when they suffer, they can plead, <HI>it is for thy sake, Psal.</HI> 44. 21. and thereupon they can argue, <HI>arise, plead thine own cause,</HI> Psal. 74. 22. needs then it must be a daring and dange∣rous
<PB N="16" REF="000581_0021_0FA70FF3AA1D8650"/>
attempt for any to set themselves <HI>to pluck down the hedges,</HI> or bark the trees, or hurt the Vines; they resist God, and <HI>who ever resisted him and prospered?</HI> and this may help the patience of Gods people, and tell them what reason there is, why they should quietly and confident∣ly commit all such things to him, knowing as∣suredly that he will find a time to right them, because his own glory is therein concerned.</P>
<P N="4">4. That nothing is to be done in the visible Church without <HI>Gods Direction.</HI> If it be his vineyard; of his planting, ordering, disposing, who then shall dare to alter, or add to his plea∣sure about it? The Owner indeed may set <HI>Watchmen</HI> to guard, and <HI>Husbandmen</HI> to dress his <HI>Vineyard;</HI> but they must wait his advise and order in the management of it: and for them to add, alter, take away, without con∣sulting him, much more against his direct Command, is audaciousness, and highly pro∣voking; and if the Church be Gods <HI>Vine∣yard,</HI> we are sure that he hath stated it, put all the Plants in their Order and Me∣thod; for men then to displace, bring an Order into his Church, <HI>that never entred in∣to his heart,</HI> and remove that which he hath established, is high contempt.</P>

<P>For Exhortation, these few Lessons may be here Learnt:</P>
<P N="1">1. Are we Gods Vineyard? labour we then to bring forth our fruits unto God. It is the complaint which he makes of <HI>Israel, Hos.</HI> 10. I. <HI>He is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit to himself.</HI> It is the Apostles demand, 1 C<HI>or.</HI> 9. 7. <HI>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not the fruit?</HI> Shall God be at all the Charge he hath laid out upon us, and shall he not have our fruits paid to him? shall we seek our selves, and our carnal interests, and neglect to glori∣fie God? God forbid! The great study and care lying upon us is to be always enquiring, how we may do most for God; how we may so live as he may have honour by us; and then we live as those that <HI>are not our own, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> bought with a price.</HI> Then indeed we answer our end, when we bring honour to him, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 43. 21.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us go to him for all the <HI>Manuring</HI> that we need at any time.

seek of him to mend us: do we find the briars and thorns of carnal lusts growing up, and beginning to stunt the graces of his Spi∣rit in us? ask him to stub them up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and let us chearfully submit to his Husbandry in all these things.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I Let this put us upon it the more to <HI>la∣ment</HI> the <HI>degeneracy</HI> of the visible Church.

<P N="4">4. Let us <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> him, and call earnestly for his <HI>help,</HI> when at any time the Church is under Oppression.

<HEAD>DOCTRINE II. <HI>ALL visible Professors are Fig-trees planted in Gods Vineyard.</HI></HEAD>
<P>That Christ designs a particular person in our Text, hath been already observed; and that it is one that is planted in the Vineyard, is in so many words expressed. That a true Convert, or one that is effectually and sa∣vingly called, cannot be only intended, the whole frame of the Parable confirms. That it cannot be applicable to any one of the Children of Men in general without limitati∣on, appears because the Heathen World are
<PB N="20" REF="000581_0025_0FA70FF5F3E4D9E0"/>
without the pale, and are reckoned in the Scripture, to be in the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> and <HI>afar off:</HI> whereas this must needs denominate some Relation to the Church of God; which can be none but that of visible Professors.</P>
<P>By these I understand all such as have by an open act of their own, acknowledged Christ and his ways, and yielded themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his <HI>G</HI>overnment in his Church; together with their Children: for God always took parents into the Covenant together with their posterity, as the Scripture fully con∣firms. Here we may enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. On what account they are called <HI>Fig-trees?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In what sense they are planted in Gods Vineyard?</P>
<P N="3">3. What advantages they do hereby en∣joy?</P>
<P N="1">1. On what account they are called <HI>Fig-trees?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That the people of God are in Scrip∣ture, particularly and personally compared to <HI>Trees,</HI> is observable: sometimes to the <HI>Cedar</HI> for its stateliness and perpetual green∣ness, P<HI>sal.</HI> 92. 12. and to the <HI>Palm Tree,</HI> for its growing the faster under weight, <HI>ibid.</HI> and often to Fruit-trees: to the <HI>Olive,</HI> for its excellent fruit, and great bearing, <HI>Psal.</HI> 52. 8. and to the <HI>Fig-tree</HI> in our Text. This is applied to Professors, not for what they al∣ways
<PB N="21" REF="000581_0026_0FA70FF6B09AC3A8"/>
always are, but for what they ought to be, and they contradict their profession if they are not so: and what God righteously ex∣pects of them, on account of the manuring which he affords them: and here let these things be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Fig-tree</HI> bears <HI>good</HI> and <HI>sweet</HI> fruit, thus we read, <HI>Judg.</HI> 9. 11. it is a fruit-bear∣ing tree, and its fruit is pleasant and whole∣some; it was therefore a great part of their Food in those <HI>Eastern</HI> Countries; and God expects of them that are in his Church, that they should be fruitful; he loves no barren ones there. <HI>Christ cursed the Pig-tree that had no fruit on it;</HI> and he expects that they should bear pleasant fruit, the works of <HI>Righ∣teousness,</HI> and <HI>true Holiness;</HI> such as he him∣self may take pleasure in, and that may be truly comfortable to themselves, God there∣fore commends their Obedience by such an expression, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9. 10. <HI>I saw your Fathers as the first ripe in the Fig-tree, at her first time.</HI> Unfruitful Professors are a disgrace to their Profession; and wicked ones are worse, who bring forth such fruits as are worse than none.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a Tree very <HI>profitable</HI> to the Own∣er, not only because its fruit is good, but be∣cause it is wont to bring forth in great plen∣ty: the Owner was well paid for his labour in tilling and tending of it; this is intima∣ted
<PB N="22" REF="000581_0027_0FA70FF7CD120DD8"/>
in <HI>Prov.</HI> 27. 18. <HI>who so keepeth the Fig-tree, shall eat the fruit thereof;</HI> and who indeed would take pains to cultivate that which will yield him no profit? God expects that Chri∣stians should be profitable in their genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣on, that they live to some good purpose. It is true, God is not essentially benefited, by any thing the Creature can do, all that it hath and is, it from him; but there is a great deal of honour redounds to the Name of God, his declarative Glory is exalted by the fruitfulness of Christians, <HI>John</HI> 15. 8. and the contrary is to his dishonour.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Figtree requires <HI>Husbandry</HI> to make its fruit pleasant and profitable. There is vast difference between those that grow wild in the Wilderness, and such as are planted in a Vineyard, and there cultivated; they are neither so fruitful, nor are their fruits com∣parable. Then is the Fig-tree most like to answer its end, when it is planted in a good Soil, and looked after with suitable care. <HI>G</HI>od doth not expect that from them that are out of the Church, which he doth from these: it is no wonder to see them barren to good works, and bearing of wild unplea∣sant fruits, but from these better is looked for; and indeed there are none that can please God, or know how to serve him ac∣ceptably, but those who are brought under
<PB N="23" REF="000581_0028_0FA70FFCEA3AD250"/>
the enjoyment of the means of Grace; hence that in <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 30.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Fig-tree</HI> puts forth and bears <HI>early.</HI> As soon as ever the Spring comes, this is one of the first Trees which by budding and set∣ting, gives evidence to it: it presently re∣ceives the influences of Heaven, and shews it self, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. 32. God looks for early fruit of those that are of his visible Church; the Professors who are born and brought up un∣der the means, should begin betime to devote themselves to his Service: they should receive impression by all the influences of the means of Grace. God looks that the Children of the Church should <HI>Serve</HI> him from their <HI>Child-hood.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The fruit of the Fig-tree <HI>Ripens Gra∣dually.</HI></P>
<P>There are some figs are ripe and it for use before others, and all the time of Harvo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, there are some ready for use every day, till the bearing time be over; hence we read of the <HI>First ripe Figs, Hos,</HI> 9. 10. Thus God would have Professors to be bringing forth of their fruits every day, du∣ring the whole season of their serving him, <HI>i, e. all their lives long, Psal,</HI> 1, 3. <HI>Bringeth forth fruit in his season,</HI> They should begin, and hold on in the service of God, be al∣ways doing something which may be for his Honour, and the good of their own
<PB N="24" REF="000581_0029_0FA70FFEAF1008E0"/>
Souls, and not be weary of it as long as they live, <HI>Psal.</HI> 92. 14. T<HI>hey shall still bring forth fruit in Old-age.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Fig-tree <HI>easily</HI> parts with its fruits when they are ripe, for the use of such as come to gather them. A little wind, or an easie shaking of the Tree, makes them to fall, <HI>Nahu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 3. 12. <HI>If they be shaken, they shall fall into the month of the eater.</HI></P>
<P>Thus should Professors be <HI>ready for every good work:</HI> they should be ripe and forward for any thing wherein they may serve God; and profit others: as soon as the <HI>wind blows;</HI> the Spirit of God suggests to them, they ought to attend him, and put forth to acts of piety: when ever they find an occasion of doing any thing for God, they should not be hard to be brought to do it; but do it with all forwardness and Cheerfulness of mind.</P>
<P N="2">2. In what sense they are planted in Gods Vineyard?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As they stand more nearly related to God in the Gospel-Covenant▪ than Hea∣then do. We are here to observe, that besides the Everlasting Covenant which is Contracted between God and his truely called ones, there is another Covenant re∣lation between God and Men, which is not Common to all, but restrained to the Visi∣ble Church, and such as are related unto
<PB N="25" REF="000581_0030_0FA710000E3D9D58"/>
that; he is for that cause said, <HI>To know them above all the Families in the Earth Amos.</HI> 3. 2. And this is of a larger extent then the former, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 6. <HI>They are not all Israel, which are of Israel.</HI> In <HI>that</HI> there are only God's chosen ones; in <HI>this</HI> there are others besides. The Gospel N<HI>et</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrown out, encloseth <HI>all sorts of fish in it good and bad,</HI> which must in time be <HI>separated.</HI> Now these have Titles of Specialty put upon them, they are called, S<HI>aints, Holy Ones, Gods peculiar people, his husbandry, his building, his Children, &amp;c.</HI> But if it be enquired how they came by this Relation, and upon what bottom it stands, take these Conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath his Elect <HI>scattered</HI> up and down among others, who must be brought in to enjoy Salvation. These are, in their Natural State, <HI>strangers, and far from God,</HI> but they must be saved: and it is cer∣tainly for their sakes that God ever empaled a vineyard, set up a Church in the World. These lie among the rubbish, have their dwelling up and down together with the rest of mankind; but God knows them, will find them out▪ and provide for their Welfare, it was <HI>for their sakes that Christ sanctified himself,</HI> John 17. 18.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Gospel is the great <HI>Instrument</HI> of Gods Appointment for Conversion. Not that his power is limited or stinted to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="26" REF="000581_0031_0FA710007088BA78"/>
way in it self, but because he hath chosen it, as that which his Infinite Wisdom hath thought most convenient, and accommodable to his design: this therefore is said to be <HI>the power of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Salvation,</HI> Rom. 1. 16. and they that are without are declared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>with∣out hope,</HI> Eph. 2. 12. In the Gospel-way, God treats men according to their own nature, by making offers, and discovering to them the way of life, and so convincing and perswad∣ing them as reasonable Creatures: and in it are all those discoveries made, which point men how they may be saved, and sent to quicken and encourage them to attend upon the same.</P>
<P N="3">3. That Gods <HI>Providence</HI> orders it that this Gospel shall be Preached there where his E∣lect are seated. If he hath any of his Cho∣sen in such a place, he takes care that the means of Salvation shall be brought unto them, because this is the way that he hath designed their Salvation by. That the sprea∣ding of the Gospel in the world, and its co∣ming to one place, and not to another, is un∣der the peculiar conduct of Gods Soveraign∣ty, is clear from Scripture, see <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 6, 7. Now, because his Elect must be called, in order to their being saved, and the <HI>G</HI>ospel is the ordinary <HI>Medium</HI> of Conversion, he hav∣ing put this honour upon it; he therefore Commissions it unto them, and his over-ru∣ling
<PB N="27" REF="000581_0032_0FA71001334FCDA0"/>
hand causeth them to enjoy it▪</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Gospel, when it comes, is not Preached to these only, but to many others. God is pleased to make use of the Ministry of men, in the dispensation of his Gospel; and he doth not tell them, (how then should they know?) who in particular belong to the Election of his <HI>G</HI>race; but he hath bid∣den them <HI>to Preach it to every Creature,</HI> Mark 16. 15. They are to cast their Net into the Sea, and take whom they can catch, to offer Christ and Life by him, unto all, to invite every one that hears them to come to him for life: the offers are to be general, <HI>Isai.</HI> 55. 1. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 17.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Gospel offers a <HI>Conditional Cove∣nant</HI> to men. In all Treaties and Transacti∣ons between God and Men, <HI>Prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pts</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> are put together, and there is a close connexion made between them, there is a certain dependence of the one upon the other, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. God reveals a new Co∣venant in the <HI>G</HI>ospel to men, he opens to them the terms of it, and requires that if they will be related to him in it, they must put themselves under these conditions: and in the visible Covenant, he accepts men on such conditions: <HI>they promise</HI> so to do, and <HI>he promiseth</HI> that if they fullfil according to their engagement, he will do so for them.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="28" REF="000581_0033_0FA7100242A36658"/>
6. Hence men, by openly <HI>owning</HI> and <HI>submitting</HI> to Gospel Termes, bring them∣selves under this Conditional Covenant. It is a grand mistake to think, that there are none in Covenant with God, but those who are absolutely under the Promise of Salvati∣on: the very notion of a Covenant implies a dependent Condition, to which the Privi∣ledges of it referr. The Visible Cove∣nant then, thus stands: God offers Christ, and Salvation by him, in the Gospel, tells men, if they believe and repent they shall be Saved; presents the <HI>G</HI>ospel Ordinances as means to work Faith and Repentance in them, and so bring them to Salvation: they accept of the offer professedly, submit to the termes, and now they are taken un∣der the Covenant, and must stand or fall to the Conditions of it: when they have thus done, they are said to be in God's Vineyard; and on this very account it is, that a People in the Visible Covenant, have so many warnings, and cautions given them, as, <HI>Psal</HI> 50, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 24.</P>
<P N="3">3. What advantages do they hereby en∣joy?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I may say with the Apostle in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 2. <HI>Much every way.</HI> Here let it be by way of caution observed, that this state of pro∣fessors, doth not secure unto them Eternal Life, because herein they do stand probatio∣ners
<PB N="29" REF="000581_0034_0FA71002D4CC8DF0"/>
for it, and may, through their own De∣fault, come short of it at last. But yet there are many Priviledges which such are made Partakers in, above these who are not in the Vineyard; in parti∣cular.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have the <HI>way</HI> to eternal life re∣vealed to them, whilst others dwell in <HI>Darkness and the Regions of the shadow of Death.</HI> These live in the <HI>Light</HI> of the Gospel, and this is to be looked upon as a great Priviledges, hence that, <HI>Math.</HI> 4. 15. 16. And it must needs be so, because they are thus brought nearer to Salvation than the other, there is now hope Concer∣ning them, whereas the other are declared to be <HI>without hope, Eph.</HI> 2. 12. Salvation depends upon Revelation, and God never useth to send his Gospel, but there where he hath this life to dispense: now it is to them that these <HI>Oracles</HI> are <HI>committed Ro.</HI> 3 2. And these Oracles point men how they may obtain Salvation, it is therefore called the <HI>Gos∣pel of peace and salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They have the <HI>offers</HI> of Eternal Life made to them. Where-ever the Gospel is enjoyed, there are made to men the Tenders of Salvation: They are not only told that there is such a thing, but they are invited to accept of it, they are called upon and coun∣selled not to reject it: they to whom this
<PB N="30" REF="000581_0035_0FA71006EFA6F1B0"/>
Embassy is committed, are <HI>to pray men to be reconciled unto God,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 20. This the Heathen live without; God doth not so much as vouchsafe to ask them if they are willing to have Christ and life by him: they are his enemies, and there is no Herald sent to them to proclaim peace among them: but Christ pleads with those that are in the Church, and complains of an affront given him, if they refuse, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 40.</P>
<P><HI>Nay▪ they have the</HI> Promise <HI>of Salvation made to them on</HI> C<HI>ondition: therefore are the</HI> Promises <HI>said to be</HI> theirs, Rom. 9. 4. <HI>for by having the Covenant, they must have the Promise too, because it is Essential to it, and there cannot be a</HI> C<HI>ove∣nant without it. It is true, it must be under∣stood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a</HI> Covenant-Promise, <HI>or else it is mist∣aken; so that none may arrogate it to themselves, but according to the tenour of the Covenant to which it belongs, and this is a great benefit, and belongs not to others, they</HI> are strangers from the <HI>C</HI>ovenants of Promise, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 12. <HI>God doth not say to them, and engage that</HI> if they believe they shall be saved; <HI>there is no such treaty passeth between them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Yea they have the <HI>means</HI> of Salvation, both outward and inward: and hereby they are in the fairer probability of obtaining it. It is the priviledge of a tree that is de∣signedly planted in a Vineyard, to have the Husbandry thereof bestowed upon it, in or∣der
<PB N="31" REF="000581_0036_0FA710084A225470"/>
to its being a good tree. Thus they who are in the Visible Church are under all means for their spiritual profit, none of which Heathen enjoy: they have the outward dis∣pensation of the Ordinances, and the inward strivings of the Spirit of God; they have <HI>line upon line, &amp;c.</HI> and all the mercies and afflictions that befal them, are under the like dispensation, made serviceable to the treaty of the <HI>G</HI>ospel, to perswade them to accept of and embrace the Salvation offered.</P>
<P N="5">5. They have the <HI>Seal</HI> of the promise af∣forded to them. <HI>Baptism,</HI> as light as some make of it, is as a <HI>sign</HI> of Gods <HI>G</HI>race, so a <HI>seal</HI> of the <HI>G</HI>ospel Covenant; and is not only an honorary put upon such as enjoy it, declaring them to belong to <HI>G</HI>od in Cove∣nant and putting his <HI>Name</HI> upon them; but it is also a Confirmation of the Promise, and it saith this for <HI>G</HI>od, to all such as he ap∣points it unto, that he will certainly and without fail be as good as his word, to put it out of doubt that if <HI>They believe they shall be Saved.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 They enjoy the outward <HI>special favours</HI> of God in Communion with his Church. God hath a special care for his Church, there is a singular protection that he affords to it, and these have rich benefits by being of it. Eve∣ry plant that is set in the vineyard, hath the priviledge of the <HI>sence</HI> and the <HI>Tower:</HI> and,
<PB N="32" REF="000581_0037_0FA71008B4ADAFF0"/>
although particular degenerate professors sometimes feel special Judgments upon them, as there will be occasion to observe after∣wards; yet how long do men that have no saving grace enjoy much by being of the vi∣sible Church? <HI>Cham</HI> scaped the universal de∣luge, by being of <HI>Noahs</HI> family; and to be sure, whilst they carry it soberly &amp; Religious∣ly, God is wont to protect them with the rest of his people.</P>
<P N="7">7. They leave the <HI>entail</HI> of these blessings to their posterity. God is wont to receive parents with their children into his Covenant, and the promise runs down to <HI>Generations:</HI> and where <HI>G</HI>od hath given saving grace to Parents, they count it an high favour of <HI>G</HI>od to them, that if their Children die in infan∣cy, they have the Covenant to comfort themselves in concerning them; if they out∣live them, though the Times are evil and threatning, yet they shall leave them plants in the Vineyard, under the Covenant protec∣tion of <HI>G</HI>od, and the visible <HI>Heirs</HI> of all the means of Salvation.</P>

A great reason why many do thus, ariseth from their mistaking &amp; misapplying the word [<HI>Church</HI>] and want of distinguishing between the <HI>Church of the first-born,</HI> &amp; the visible Church, and the priviledges which are peculiar, and those that are common: <HI>Church,</HI> is sometimes taken for the Called and Converted, every visible professor is not of this, Rom 9 6. <HI>all are not Israel, that are of Israel.</HI> Sometimes for all such as are externally in Covenant with <HI>G</HI>od, and so it includes them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 5.

<P>For Exhortation: And it may be directed,</P>
<P N="1">1. To all visible Professors; let the con∣sideration of this truth teach you,</P>
<P N="1">1. A Lesson of <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to God for this great favour and dignity that he hath advanced you to. Think what a favour it is, and how much you are priviledged by it, think how it is with the Heathen World, who are <HI>without God, without Christ, &amp;c.</HI> and how comes it that you are not so? what are you by nature better than they? whence came this but from the meer good pleasure of God? it was only because <HI>it so seemed good to him</HI> to make you thus to <HI>differ?</HI> Is there any distinguishing mercy in having the Ora∣cles of God, the hopes of Salvation, and all encouragements to further you in the pursuit of it? let him have the praise of it?</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>endeavour</HI> after <HI>fruitfulness:</HI> to bear much, and to bear good and sweet fruit. Are you in the Vineyard? bear then: are you fig-trees there? then bear figs. Let your fruit prove that you are indeed <HI>Trees of Righteousness,</HI> such as may be a credit to the Vineyard wherein you grow; and let this consideration be a quickning motive to you

<P N="2">2. To Children and young ones in parti∣cular; are you Gods fig-trees? do then as the figtree doth: labour to put forth betimes, and to bear early fruit: is it not spring-time with you through <HI>G</HI>ods mercy? have you not all the means and advantages of being good betimes? and let me assure you Chil∣dren, that <HI>G</HI>od thinks it long before you set your selves to seek and serve him: and Oh how acceptable would it be to him to see you make haste and not delay to devote your selves to him, by forsaking of youthful lusts, and dedicating your blooming years to him.

<P N="2">II. The <HI>barrenness</HI> of the Fig-tree taken notice of by the Owner; and here are two things to be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Husbandmans peculiar inspection which he had upon this plant, <HI>He came and sought fruit thereon. [He came,] i. e.</HI> to this particular Tree.

<PB N="39" REF="000581_0044_0FA710132E8B38E0"/>
an enquiring after something that one is at a loss about; but God knows what eve∣ry one is, and will do: but it intends both a curious inspection and a rational expectati∣on. The word is sometimes used for earnest desiring, yea importunately requiring a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God requires it, and well may he observe whether they do answer this injunction of his. [<HI>Fruit thereon,</HI>] Fig-trees are planted for bearing, and visible Professors are put into the Church that they may have oppor∣tunity for serving God: and well may it be expected that every thing should answer its end.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Husbandmans disappointment, or missing of his expectation; <HI>he found none.</HI> Notwithstanding his best care in seeking, he could not find one fig upon the tree; and this inferrs, that there was none, for if there had been any, be would have discover∣ed it: God to be sure, who is Omniscient, cannot but see and know whether there be a∣ny thing done by the Professor that is truly good.</P>
<P>There are three Observations which we may gather, and briefly improve from this passage.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE I. <HI>God expects that every one that is planted in his Vineyard should bring forth fruits answerable to this Planting.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And this is a rational expectation. What Husbandman that sees a fruit-tree in his En∣closure, would expect otherwise?</P>
<P>In clearing up this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into.</P>
<P N="1">1. What fruit is it that God expects?</P>
<P N="2">2. In what respect he may be said thus to expect it?</P>
<P N="3">3. What reason there is why he may justly so expect?</P>
<P N="1">1. What <HI>fruit</HI> it is that God expects?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not any fruit of what kind soever; for if so, then God would never miss of his expectation. All men are doing something o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other; every man hath his works which he must be called to an <HI>account</HI> for, be <HI>judged</HI> by, and receive a <HI>recompense</HI> according∣ly, 2 C<HI>or.</HI> 5. 10. there are the <HI>fruits of the flesh,</HI> as well as <HI>of the spirit;</HI> but there are some fruits that are reckoned as worse than none, and let men have never so many of them, they are for all accounted barren, <HI>Hos.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. 1. every man looks that his Trees should
<PB N="41" REF="000581_0046_0FA710150193ABD8"/>
bear, according to the kind they were plant∣ed for, and had a resemblance of: they do not go about to gather <HI>figs of Thistles;</HI> but they promise themselves, that if they be fig-trees, they will surely bear figs, and good ones too; if therefore the Vine bear <HI>grapes,</HI> yet if they prove <HI>wild and sower,</HI> they are as bad as none, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. 2. They that are placed in the visible Church are fig-trees, they seem at least to be so, they bear such leaves upon them; not that God can be deceived in any, he knows what they are indeed, but by their outward profession they declare themselves to be such: they say they are Gods people, <HI>called by his name,</HI> devoted to his service; they are visibly <HI>plants of Righteousness.</HI> The fruits then which God expects of such are the fruits of righteousness; that they should live a life of <HI>faith which works by love;</HI> that they should serve and obey him in all things, should walk in an holy conformity to his re∣vealed will, should <HI>do the works of God;</HI> live answerably to the <HI>teachings of the grace which hath appeared to them, Tit.</HI> 2. 11, 12. In summe, that they walk in conformity to the Rules of Gods Word, frame their lives in all things according to it: these are fruits pleasing to him, and such as become his Vineyard, and those wherein you may <HI>shew forth his praise.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. On what account he may be said thus to expect it?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="000581_0047_0FA710159059C2B0"/>
<HI>A.</HI> Though God condescends to speak to us in our language, yet it becomes us always to interpret him so as is becoming his Sacred Majesty. All things therefore that imply any infirmity in men, are to be removed from our thoughts in our interpretation of him, in what he declares to us. Here then let us observe that when men are said to expect a thing, it implies, 1. That they are at some loss about it before hand. 2. That they en∣tertain it in an hope. 3. That this hope de∣pends upon probabilites that may be frustra∣ted &amp; so they may miss. We are not to sup∣pose any such thing concerning the great God, for, <HI>what he desires, he doth:</HI> he knows all things a forehand, for they depend upon his All Efficiency, he cannot therefore be disap∣pointed, or lose his hope. This expectation therefore is not to be attributed to him in respect of his <HI>secret will,</HI> decrees, or purposes; as if he had left any of them dubious or un∣certain, or depending on the creature, on which he must wait before he can determine what will be, this is altogether incompatible to the Divine nature: But it must be inter∣preted of his <HI>revealed will,</HI> in respect of the transactions that have past between <HI>G</HI>od and his People: for, as he treats with them as men, so he is said to look for this or that from them, after the manner of men. It notes the connexion between the end and
<PB N="43" REF="000581_0048_0FA7101BC5D656C8"/>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utableness of the means for the advan∣cing of the end; here then observe in par∣ticular.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is some <HI>worthy end</HI> of God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> planting a Church in the World. God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Works are all done in Wisdom: nor Wis∣dom always proposeth to it self a worthy end in all that it doth. <HI>God doth nothing in vain.</HI> There is a great deal of Gods care, and singular Providence discovers it self in and about the affairs of his Church; in the raising up of Instruments, and sending them forth into the world, with a Commission to gather men out of it into his Vineyard; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n giving them his Gospel and Ordinances; in making of his Covenant known to them there is something peculiar which God doth to and for these, from what he doth for other men, <HI>he hath not dealt so by all nations.</HI> There must therefore be some peculiar and eminent design in it, or otherwise he would not have thus done: and it is worthy our enquiry af∣ter, that so we may be able to give him the honour that is due to him for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are to distinguish between the end of the <HI>purpose</HI> and of the <HI>precept.</HI> If we speak of Gods purposes, <HI>he knows all his works</HI> concerning them, <HI>before the foundation of the World,</HI> and here he can never be at a loss or disappointed: but that is <HI>secret</HI> to us, and therefore belongs not to our curious search,
<PB N="44" REF="000581_0049_0FA7101D816D3430"/>
<HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 29. But then the precept of <HI>G</HI>od is that in which he is pleased to reveal him∣self to us, and shews us what is his will con∣cerning our Duty, or what he hath seen meet to make a duty incumbent upon us; now in the preceptive discovery of Gods Will to his people, he hath told them what it is they ought to propose to themselves as their end, and what are the means which they are to make use of in order to their obtaining it; and this is that which we call <HI>mans</HI> end, be∣cause he is commanded to seek it, and <HI>Gods</HI> end too, because he hath enjoyned men to seek it, and which he intends also to bring about in all these whom he hath ordained to <HI>eternal life, Joh.</HI> 28. 28.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the end which every one in the visi∣ble Church is called and pointed to, is to bear fruit. It is true, <HI>G</HI>od hath a purpose of his own concerning them, which shall ne∣ver be frustrate, he will have his honour by them, whether they fructify or no; which way soever it falls, he will have his glory, <HI>Paul is a sweet savour of God, in them that are saved, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them that perish.</HI> But this is that which God enjoyns them all in: this is his positive command, which he hath laid upon every one that are taken so near unto him: that they do serve and obey him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43. 2. <HI>This people have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my praise.</HI> God requires this
<PB N="45" REF="000581_0050_0FA7101EDA1A6F20"/>
of every one, and what men require, they are wont to expect: for, because all men owe Obedience to all the commands of God, and his people are under peculiar, as well as general obligations hereunto, who that is so related would not look that such should o∣bey him? for men then to fail in this res∣pect, is to come short of their end; and God complains as if he had done for them in vain, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 30.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all the means that are used with them look directly this way. We are wont to judge of mens designs, by their actions; and by their designs we rationally judge of their expectations; for all men have a secret hope that their designs will succeed, else they would not be at cost to promove them. Now he that shall but rightly consider the nature and tendency of all that is done by God to &amp; for his visible Church, and every one in it, must needs say that all hath a direct and pro∣per reference <HI>to</HI> their bearing the fruits of Ho∣liness: for what else doth the <HI>G</HI>ospel Covenant oblige men to, but to glorify God? and that is by a <HI>rightly ordered Conversation;</HI> what else do all the <HI>G</HI>ospel commands serve to, but to <HI>shew man the way ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> he is thus to do? what are all the promises for, but to give them all encouragment needful, to excite and engage them hereunto? and what is the aspect of all the threatnings, but to awaken them, and
<PB N="46" REF="000581_0051_0FA7101F52F7C620"/>
make them careful of their duty, and afraid to neglect it; and what are all the afflictive providences they meet with for, but to <HI>purge them that they may bear more fruit?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Hence God may truly be said on this ac∣count to expect it. Who would not be obey∣ed in his just commands? and there are two things which among men, are wont eventually to discover to us what they expected, and both these may be attributed to God, accor∣ding to scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are wont to be <HI>pleased</HI> when their expectations are answered; it gives them a great deal of satisfaction, and we shall find that God is well pleased with the obedience of his People, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13 16. <HI>with such Sacrifices God is well pleased.</HI> He is therefore said to <HI>smell a savour of rest</HI> in such things: if <HI>A∣bel offers his firstlings and the fat, God hath a respect to him,</HI> see <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 5. he will there∣fore say to them that husband their Talents profitably, <HI>well done good and faithful servant:</HI> and he hath gracious rewards to bestow upon such, wherein he testifies how grateful they are to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are wont to be <HI>displeased,</HI> if they miss of their expectation, they take it ill, and it is a matter of trouble to them; and the reason is, because, they promised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣selves the contrary. Now God in his Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> witness to his great displeasure at all
<PB N="47" REF="000581_0052_0FA7101FF4BB4480"/>
such as are in his Church, who do not bear fruit▪ so he did at this fig-tree: <HI>verse</HI> 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which kindleth his anger against his people, and is the occasion of all the Judgments that are brought upon them: when therefore the Scripture gives us an ac∣count of the many fearful Calamities wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> God made his people to undergo, this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made the procuring cause of them; they did <HI>not obey him,</HI> but they <HI>sinned against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and all this intimates that which unto men would amount to a seeking or expecting of fruit from such as these are▪</P>
<P N="3">3. What reason there is why he may just∣ly so expect?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If their be any reason for an husband∣man to expect fruit, of a tree that he hath laid out cost and care upon, then well may God look for it of those that are planted in his visible Church, for there is nothing want∣ing there as to means for their help hereunto▪ therefore we have the demand, <HI>Isai,</HI> 5. 4. <HI>What could I have done more?</HI> this will appear if we consider.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have sufficient <HI>Conviction</HI> afforded them of the unreasonableness of Disobedi∣ence, and reasonableness of Obedience. In the Word and Ordinances these discoveries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>entifully made to them, in which the nature, and evil fruits of sin are plainly see before them, the beauty of Holiness, and
<PB N="48" REF="000581_0053_0FA71020D1FCA8F8"/>
rationality as well as profitableness of the Ser∣vice of God is made clear by several Demon∣strations: They are but poor, dark and glimmering notions of these things that the Heathen discover, by the best improvement of the light of nature; but in the visible Church, these things are from time to time exhibited, and the undeniableness of these truths made to appear.</P>
<P N="2">2. They have here also sufficient <HI>direction</HI> af∣forded them, to point out the way to them, in which they may serve God, &amp; bear the fruits of obedience, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6. 8. <HI>he hath shewed thee the way O Man!</HI> the world are unacquainted with this, the way of natural obedience is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them, but that of Gospel obedience is alto∣gether hidden from <HI>them▪ Ro.</HI> 3.17. <HI>the way of peace have they not known.</HI> But these have such discoveries, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147. 16. <HI>he she<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth his word unto Jacob, his Statutes and Judgments unto Is∣rael.</HI> The <HI>Object</HI> of their obedience, <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> God in Christ, is here made known in his Glo∣rious excellencies and perfections; the <HI>way</HI> how fallen man may serve <HI>G</HI>od acceptably, <HI>i. e,</HI> by Faith in Christ, and grace derived from him, is here declared: the <HI>Duties</HI> in which he is thus to be obeyed, and the <HI>sins</HI> that are to be avoided, are here deciphered, and from time to time explained unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have plentiful warnings against sin, and encouragements to obedience laid be∣fore
<PB N="49" REF="000581_0054_0FA7102175C3DEC8"/>
them. God here tells them the danger of the one, and the great benefit that shall accrue to them by the other; the threatnings and the promises do fully exhibit these things: the death and destruction that by living in sin they shall bring themselves to; the life and glory that is to be enjoyed in fearing and serving God are urged upon them. God is often saying to them, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 13. <HI>if ye live after the flesh ye shall dy, &amp;c.</HI> In the Law is discovered the wrath of God against all Unrighteousness; in the <HI>G</HI>ospel, the great salvation purchased by Christ, and applied to them that believe in him and serve him, is made known.</P>
<P N="4">4. All needful help is offered them, to en∣able them thus to serve God, and bring forth fruits to his praise. Man indeed is in himself without strength, he cannot serve God, his Moral Powers are enervated, and altogether disabled by Original sin: but this is no excuse to him, because God hath told him where his help is, <HI>Hos.</HI> 13. 9. and he hath promised his spirit to them that ask him yea and bids them to ask him; nay the spirit himself offers his help to them, and is grieved that they refuse him, and quench his motions in them, he is ready to relieve their infirmities, to supply the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a new principle of <HI>G</HI>race, and str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h, and continued influence to help them to be fruitful.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="50" REF="000581_0055_0FA71022603193C0"/>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence how inexcusable will they be another day, who have had a place in Gods Church, and yee bear no fruit there? doth</HI> God <HI>expect it? and hath he so much reason to look for it? and do they do what in them lies to cross his</HI> ex∣pectations

<P>For <HI>Exhortation:</HI> Let this then be a loud call to every one in the vineyard to be fruit∣ful. Doth God expect this of you? be ad∣vised then to answer his expectation, let not this Husbandman lose his labour and cost; and for motive, consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. God will certainly be angry with you, if you do not thus do. It will be a very great provocation to him; it will put him upon thinking what to do with you; he will be weary of his vineyard. Should the Hus∣bandman lose his cost and labour, plant vines and they bear nothing, set fig-trees, and they bring forth unpleasant fruits; and after ma∣ny essays to make it serviceable, it rather grows worse, will he not be provoked to throw it up? and so God threatens. <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. 4. there is not a readier way to bring ruine <HI>G</HI>od is not so engaged as not to do it, what saith he to <HI>Jerusalem?

with him, as it is with men; if they are frus∣trated of their hopes, they lose all their ex∣pense; but God will not, for he needs not so to do: If the plants in his vineyard will not serve for fruit, they will do for burning, and therein also will he be glorified, and by so much as these have had more cost and pains laid out upon them, by so much more will the Justice of <HI>G</HI>od shine forth in his Righteous Revenge, when his wrath shall burn upon them in proportion to the expense which he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out for them: it is not he therefore but you that will be sufferers, <HI>Paul is a sweet savour of God, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 2.<HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 15. 16:</P>

<P N="4">4. How unreasonable is it that you should

<P N="5">5. If you bear no fruit, you will have no plea for it that will stand you instead, when <HI>G</HI>od shall come to reckon up all his layings out upon you, all the advantages which a day of grace hath afforded you, your mouths will then be stopt, and you will be filled with amazement.

<HEAD>DOCTRINE II. <HI>God doth particularly and curiously look after e∣very one that lives under the means of grace, to see whether they bear fruit accordingly.</HI> </HEAD>
<P>H<HI>E not only looks after the places in general where his Gospel is enjoyed, and he hath a visible Church, with a more critical eye than he doth other places; but this Observation, and ex∣act inspection of his extends to every individual there: he so looks after every one, as if there were but that one and no more to set his observa∣tion upon. God is here compared to a curious and provident Husbandman, who, having a vineyard, is often in it, and walks from tree to tree at every season, and takes a full view
<PB N="57" REF="000581_0062_0FA7102EB9AB7D20"/>
of each, to see how it sprouts, buds, blossoms, sets for fruit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not omitting of one.</HI></P>
<P>Here three things may be enquired after,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What is this curious observation of God?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How it appears that he doth this by every individual?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Why he so doth?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. What is this curious observation which God makes?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may come at something of this in the following Conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is an essential <HI>Omnipresence</HI> of <HI>G</HI>od with all his creatures: This is one of the Divine Attributes or perfections which belong to God; it belongs to his preroga∣tive, and is fully and frequently ascribed to him in the Scripture: Because he is an In∣finite, Immense and Uncomprehended Being, he must needs therefore be every where: be∣cause place cannot contain him, he must of necessity contain all place: hence that, <HI> I Kings</HI> 8. 27. <HI>behold, the Heaven, and Heaven of Hea∣vens cannot contain thee;</HI> the Heaven of Hea∣vens, is the third Heaven, which is the ut∣most limit of place, and there is none beyond it: hence there is no getting away from him, or absconding ourselves any where, where he is not, <HI>Psal,</HI> 139. 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Hence it follows that he must certainly be <HI>Omniscient.</HI> If he be every where, he
<PB N="58" REF="000581_0063_0FA710334D46DD60"/>
must needs know every thing. Not only doth God assume this Atribute to himself, but it also is necessarily inferred from his Omni∣presence. We are to conceive of God under the Notion of an Intelligent Being; knowledg is therefore ascribed to him; and that not in the concrete only but in the abstract, without an Hyperbole, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 14. <HI>I am Understanding,</HI> wheresoever then God is, he is there by his knowledge: his knowledge is his Being, and must be Inseperable from it; and, because his perfections are him∣self, and he is an undivided Being, where he is, there he is in all his Attributes; although he makes the manifestations of them to the Creatures according to his Plea∣sure.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Omniscience of God must needs comprize in it a distinct knowledge of all Creatures in particular, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all their action. Universal Understanding cannot be Confined meerly to Universals or to Generals, but it must reach to individuals; and that not meerly as to their beings or natures, but their actions too; none of these must be hid from him; nay it saith that he minds, regards, takes particular notice of them; he is for this reason said to <HI>count them, Job.</HI> 31. 4. and, to <HI>be acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, Psal.</HI> 139. 13 And this knowledge is extended to the most secret things, even the <HI>Hearts</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="000581_0064_0FA710352A596670"/>
of men, which are very deep; the <HI>thoughts</HI> which others can hardly guess at; we are then assured that there is no <HI>hiding of Coun∣sel from him.</HI> God is all Eye, &amp; that eye is fixt upon all things, and therefore is said to <HI>behold</HI> them, and look upon them <HI>Psal.</HI> 33. 13. 14.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence God cannot, in propriety of speech, be said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o know one thing more than another; or to observe one thing more intensly than another: if we consider this observation as it is in God, it cannot be more or less, intended or remitted; for God doth all things like himself, he is the same <HI>G</HI>od; he cannot know or see one thing more dis∣tinctly or clearly than another; all things come equally under his cognizance; he is no more intimately acquainted with the things in heaven, than with those in hell; his actual knowledge of all must be infinite, and in that which is infinite, there are no de∣grees: All Beings are comprehended in him, <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 28. and therefore intimate acquain∣tance with them all belongs to him; yea and all Beings are to be improved by him for his glory; he must therefore know them through∣ly, and all their motions, that so he may not miss of his glory by them.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are yet some persons and things in which God will have more of his declara∣tive glory to shine forth than in others: it
<PB N="60" REF="000581_0065_0FA71036E81EC080"/>
is Gods declarative glory which is his last end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all his works; and he will be glorified in them all; yet not in all alike: some things he will be more seen in than others; he hath not put into all things a like capacity of re∣presenting his perfections: he hath not laid out so much upon some as he hath done upon others; and therefore he doth not look for so much from those as from these: he hath giv∣en to some creatures a more excellent being, and endued them with more noble Faculties, and they have <HI>larger capacities, Job.</HI> 35. 9, 10. he providentially bestows more advantages and helps on some than he doth upon others; and he will be no loser by any thing that he doth, he will either receive, or recover more from them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 48.</P>
<P N="6">6. This glory of his is most of all concer∣ned in his (Vineyard) or, Church: there is a glory which he will have by irrational crea∣tures, <HI>his works shall praise him;</HI> but there is a special glory that he will have by men; hence there are the great Attributes of his Justice and Grace are concerned about them, and must be made to shine out in them; but a∣mong men, there are some whom he hath a more special respect to: all are under the conduct of special Government, and to be led to be everlasting monuments of his glory: but he hath a peculiar people among these, a selected number▪ gathered out of these, whom
<PB N="61" REF="000581_0066_0FA7103738F3A2B8"/>
he hath done more for, and expects more from, and will have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honour in &amp; by the result, and these are his Church: here he most of all manifests himself, and they are to be molded into a Church to shew forth his glory, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43. 21.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence he is said, after the manner of men, to have a special inspection over these: because he lays out more upon them, and ex∣pects more from them; he is therefore said to look more peculiarly after them: as one which has a plat of ground planted with choice plants; and on which he lays out more than ordinary cost, will he not expect more from it, &amp; be more curious in observing of it, and all the plants there growing; and takes but little care of the rest of his ground in comparison of what he doth for this; God is therefore said to know them after a pecu∣liar manner, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 2. is said to wink at the other, to suffer them to go on in their ways, as if he were careless or not concerned about them; but for his vineyard, to be looking there for grapes, to be visiting it, and coming again and again to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How it appears that he doth thus by every individual?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Besides the consideration, of what hath been already mentioned, that Gods all-know∣ledge respects all individuals, both persons &amp; actions, and that <HI>G</HI>od hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> special glory
<PB N="62" REF="000581_0067_0FA71038046AD048"/>
that he is concerned for in his visible Church below; these things are to be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God doth particularly and per∣sonally either Commend or Reprove these. It is not only his Church in <HI>G</HI>eneral, or these and these bodies of Professors, that he so expresseth himself unto, but to persons also. An evident instance for this we have in <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> G<HI>en.</HI> 4. <HI>Begin.</HI> And this is intimated by Christ in another Parable, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> of the Wedding Supper, where the Lord observed that one person that had not on the <HI>Wedding Garment,</HI> and treats him ac∣cordingly. If a Church do well in General, yet if it hath within it such as do other∣wise, and provoke <HI>G</HI>od, he tells them of such, and reproves them for suffering them, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 14. 20. If the visible Church be gone to decay, and there be a <HI>Noah</HI> in it that is righteous, <HI>G</HI>od notes him, and com∣mends him fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it: if there be one good Child in <HI>Jerebodoms</HI> wicked family, he is spe∣cified; if there is one cursed <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Noah's</HI> family, he hath his brand.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Gods Mercies and Judgments are very signally observable in these; not only do these respect the Church in general, or this or that particular Church, but these and those individual persons in it. Not only when Gods People do walk closely with him, have they more observeable and admirable deliver∣ances conferred upon them; and when they highly provoke him, do they meet with
<PB N="63" REF="000581_0068_0FA71038AFC3EBA8"/>
more stupendous visitations, and <HI>Come down wonderfully;</HI> but this is oftentimes apparent in particular persons. Sometimes when the Church is preserved in peace and prosperity, yet particular <HI>Sinners in Zion</HI> are animad∣verted upon; &amp; thus <HI>the Fig-tree</HI> in the <HI>Text;</HI> when <HI>G</HI>od is bringing of Judgments upon the body of a Church, yet there are some who must first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>have <HI>a mark set upon them;</HI> for their preservation, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9. 3. And <HI>it shall go well with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> </HI> of <HI>Jeremiah: Baruch</HI> and <HI>Ehedweleel</HI> shall have <HI>their</HI> lives given them fore prey, when utter desolation is coming upon the whole Land.</P>
<P N="3">3. That God is in Scripture recorded to take notice of such Individuals as men would least think of. Such as we would account to be least of all thought of; God Eies them: the poor and despised in the World, whom men regard not, yet <HI>G</HI>od observes them, and takes notice how they carry it, and he accounts it his great Glory so to do, <HI>Psal.</HI> 102. 17. Such actions also as we might think lay most out of Ob∣servation; their secret and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired duties which they are engaged in; let but a <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣thanael get under a fig-tree</HI> to pray, and it shall be recorded: nay so curious is he in his Observation, that there cannot a <HI>tear</HI> fall from them, but he puts it <HI>in his bottle,</HI> nor
<PB N="64" REF="000581_0069_0FA710396F861B70"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh</HI> pass, but he writes it down in has <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ovh Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. 8.</P>
<P N="3">3. Why <HI>G</HI>od takes such a curious and distinct Observation of these, to see what fruit they bring forth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The ground of this will appear if we lay these things together.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which <HI>G</HI>od expects of his Visible Church, is fruit, this hath bin already clear∣ed in the former Doctrine. God would be honoured and served by some in the World; other men pay him no Tribute, bring forth no fruits that he can tast any pleasancy in; he therefore for that end planted his Church that from it he might receive some revenue in the world; that all the world might not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in Wickedness,</HI> and nothing but dishonour him, as all the residue of mankind certainly and unavoidably do.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence God is honoured by his Visible Church proportionably to the good fruits which they bear. This is the proper and only way in the which they can so serve to his praise, as to answer the end of their being a Church. The rest of mankind shall answer his designs upon them, in some other way; for God will have his honour upon all: but except these serve God, <HI>do the works of God,</HI> yeild the fruits of Obedience, they live in vain: and consequently, the more careful and constant they are in these services the more honour
<PB N="65" REF="000581_0070_0FA7103A4A939C70"/>
they bring to God. Every act of true Obe∣dience hath of this in it, when then these are multiplied, God hath great glory by such.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Church consists of individuals, and consequently the honour which God hath by his Church, is by the individuals in it. The Church is an aggregate body, it is made up of particular persons; and the duty of bea∣ring fruit lies upon every one of them: what therefore God expec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of his Church is personally expressed, as well as joyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly; a Vineyard consists of particular plants; by the bearing of these, the fruitfulness of the Vineyard is known? and the way for the Owner to know whether it answers its ends, Is to go from tree to tree, and see how they bear; and in no other way is he acquainted with the state of the whole. If every one in the Church be faithful to God, that is a faithful Church indeed: so many as there are belonging to it that are otherwise, do make It to come so far short, and to be unto such a degree barren; God therefore observes each, because he will know the state of his Vine∣yard.</P>
<P N="4">4. These individuals are there planted by his special Providence; men are ready to think that all these things are casual, and meerly eventual, and do not see an higher hand in them; but gracious Souls acknow∣ledge
<PB N="66" REF="000581_0071_0FA7103AF14C6068"/>
a peculiar favourable Providence in it. They are <HI>lines</HI> that are here <HI>fallen</HI> unto them <HI>Psal.</HI> 16. 7. It is a Metaphor taken from the custom among men, in laying out and boun∣ding of mens Allotments. There is there∣fore a peculiar remark made upon this; <HI>this &amp; that man was born in Zion,</HI> P<HI>sal</HI> 87. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. and as there is much of Gods good will display∣ing of it self to them, in making it their portion to be in his Church, so there it some special aim at his own glory in <HI>it, con∣cerning</HI> every one; and therefore <HI>according</HI> to our <HI>conception, G</HI>od <HI>is</HI> singula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly concerned to look after these.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>God must have glory by them that do not bear, as well as by them that do. That it is awful∣ly true, that all those that are in the visible Church do not yield the fruit expected, will be considered in the next Doctrine; although these do not glorifie God; but</HI> come short <HI>of it, yet God must not, will not be a loser by them. No man would willingly be a loser by any thing that he doth, if he could help it; God can help it, and he wilt. But he is not glorified in the one, after the same manner that he is in the other; the one is</HI> found to the <HI>praise</HI> of the glory of <HI>his</HI> grace, <HI>the others are to be made monu∣ments of the</HI> Glory <HI>of his Justice. The one are made happy in their glorifying</HI> G<HI>od; the other are made miserable by it: it is therefore requisite that</HI> G<HI>od observe, and have a particular know∣ledge
<PB N="67" REF="000581_0072_0FA7103F2EC0B060"/>

<P N="6">6. There are particular and personal re∣wards that God hath to distribute to men, ac∣cording to the fruits they bear. These Re∣wards God stands obliged to in the Covenant Promises and Threatnings; for both of these belong to the Gospel-Covenant in which the visible Church is empaled: there is therefore a Day of Judgment appointed, in which Christ will not only sit upon the world, but also upon his Vineyard, in which he will give each one his recompense according as he is found; and this is personal: for, <HI>we must e∣very one of us give an account of himself to God.</HI> In the dispensing of these recompences, God will proceed with men, <HI>according to their deeds, Rom.</HI> 2. 6. and that will be very diversly, <HI>verse</HI> 7, 8, 9. and it is of infinite moment, whether man be adjudged to happiness or mi∣sery: and how <HI>shall the Judge of all the earth do that which is right</HI> in all this, if he do not observe who bear fruit, and who is barren? and the more curious must the observation be, if we consider, that not only fruitfulness and barrenness, but the more fruits there are of either sort, the more recompense is mea∣sured. Some bear more than others, and therefore some are to have greater degrees of glory, and others more amazing wrath to fall

<P>For <HI>Information</HI> in two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. See here the Atheism of all such as are bold to sin, because they think that God re∣gards them not. For the Heathen, that know not God, thus to do, is not so much to be wondred at; and yet even some of them will rise up in Judgment against us, if we do thus: but for those that are taken so near un∣to <HI>G</HI>od, as all they are that are in his Church to be guilty of this, is an astonishing thing; whether there be any among us that dare to say it in words, may be questioned; but there are too many whose practices declare them to be directed by these false principles, this is too evident; and indeed, that is the root of all wickedness that is committed among Professors: God himself acquaints us, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hence sprang all the impiety and wickedness of the men of <HI>Judah, Ezek</HI> 8. 12. <HI>They say God seeth not;</HI> it may be they did not say it any otherwise but in their hearts? and truly this is little if any thing better than what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ool saith, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>There is no God, Psal.</HI> 14. 1. would those that are of the holy seed per∣petrate

such abominations as they do? would they that have the name of God called upon them, and that are under the obligations of the <HI>G</HI>ospel-Covenant, live like Heathen that know not God? would they drive a trade of sin and vanity, were they indeed perswaded that they are under the watchful eye of the great God, which is making dayly remarks upon what they do, and taking a most distinct account of all their actions? surely it could not be. If they thought that the flaming Eye of his Jealousie were looking intensly upon them, it would make them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raid of doing such things as they do,</P>
<P N="3">3. Learn hence also the unspeakable folly of Hypocrisie. Such as make an high profes∣sion, and pretend to be flourishing trees in the Vineyard; but mean while think to put God off with leaves instead of fruit; or fruits which though they seem fair to the eyes of men, are yet rotten at the core: Do such men think to impose upon him? no, they deceive their own Souls, but <HI>God is not to be mocked,</HI> he looks too curiously to be made to take a tree that is only full of leaves, for one that is full of fruit. It is fruit that he is seeking for, and he will discern whether there be any there or no: and he knows how to distinguish good fruit from bad: his Vineyard brought forth <HI>grapes,</HI> but what then? possible they were fair to look upon,
<PB N="70" REF="000581_0075_0FA7104330A99C70"/>
but they were indeed <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owre</HI> and <HI>wild,</HI> and he discovered it, and thereupon condemned it, as if it had born nothing at all; men may do a great many things that are like O∣bedience for the matter of them. But if they have not the right principle: are not the product of saving grace in the soul, <HI>G</HI>ods curious eye will discover the difference, and what profit will they yield when he shall re∣ject them, and profess that he takes no plea∣sure in them?</P>

<P><HI>Let this be for a word of solemn warning to all that are in the visible Church, to beware of barrenness there, and what greater caution can there be set before Christians, than the conside∣ration that God looks after every one of them, to see how they behave themselves in pursuit of the profession which they have made? for certainly God is not an idle spectator; and this will here∣after be made awfully to appear. Think what a shame it is to be in the Vineyard, and yet to be unfruitful; and then add to think, that the Lord of the Vineyard sees this, and will let us sooner or later know that he sees it too; and can it be for our comfort to be so found and charged by him in the day of accounts? do not your own Consciences sometimes reflect and accuse you, and

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="application">

<P><HI>To quicken and encourage us all in our endea∣vours after fruitfulness. Doth</HI> G<HI>od take such particular notice of each of us? let every Chri∣stian carry this thought upon his own heart, &amp; make it an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entive and engagement to him, to endeavour to answer</HI> G<HI>ods ends in this respect▪ And there are these three things which this thought should engage and excite us unto.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To see that we bring forth good fruit. If God be so curious, let it make us to be so too. They that would approve themselves to an all-seeing and heart searching God, had need to take heed to themselves, and beware of being imposed upon. God not only looks whether we bear, but what we bear; let us do so too: and here let us know, that <HI>the tree must be made good, if ever the fruit be good: grapes are not gathered of thorns.</HI> It should make all that call them∣selve Christians, to be afraid of living one day in a state of unregeneracy; for as
<PB N="72" REF="000581_0077_0FA71044D4139A48"/>
long as we so do, we do nothing at all that will turn to account. See that you have a principle of <HI>G</HI>race within, and then take heed that your lives be the continued exer∣cise of it,</P>
<P N="2">2. To take care that we bear much fruit. When you have gotten grace into your Hearts let in be your industrious en∣deavour to bring it forth into action through your whole life and Conversation. The best of us have <HI>another Law</HI> in our <HI>Members,</HI> which will be putting it self forth, and do∣ing of such works as must be burnt <HI>up: G</HI>race must be carefully Nourished and Exci∣ted, else it will be born down and suppres∣sed by the Carnal part within us.</P>
<P N="3">3. To be sure to bring forth secret fruits. Here is the least d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger of Hypocrisy. We may do many things <HI>which</HI> a love of Applause <HI>&amp;</HI> Commendation from men may excite us to but our secret service, which is done out of the reach of the eye and observation of others, is that which is in the least danger of de∣cieveing us; because herein we have better evidence that we <HI>set God before us:</HI> and that you may he truely thus engaged, here is your help; to be always thinking, God is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my right hand, his eye is upon me, and there are these three Motives which the Doctrine before us affords, to put
<PB N="73" REF="000581_0078_0FA71045766DD680"/>
us upon Carefully and Cheerfully doing thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. If God sees, he will aprove us if we thus do. He looks with great Approbation upon the Faithful Endeavours of his <HI>C</HI>hil∣dren; it pleaseth him highly to see them en∣gaged for him and his glory in all that they do. And what should please or sa∣tisfy us more or better, than that the God we profess to serve, takes Content in our Duties, and <HI>Smells a sweet savour</HI> in <HI>them?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Thus only shall we answer the end of our being planted in Gods Vineyard. The reason why <HI>G</HI>od looks so exactly, is, as we heard, because he would not miss his end, that if we answer it not one way, he may have it of us in another: And re∣member, if we do thus, it is the way for us to be continued in the Vineyard, and have the constant influences of his Grace; for <HI>to them that have, more shall be given:</HI> God will not be wanting to us, if we take heed to be faithful to him in our improvements, and therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. We shall not lose our labour. For if <HI>G</HI>od observes in particular, then he will not forget to reward us in particular. There is a great recompense promised to them that are faithful, and it is a strong consolation to all such as are so, to consider that he who
<PB N="74" REF="000581_0079_0FA710468B054DE8"/>
hath thus promised, keeps the account of all the care and fidelity of his people, even to the most secret Duty which they do in since∣rity; and our Saviour hath given us this Assurance, <HI>That our father that seeth in secret will reward us openly.</HI></P>

<P>This is a necessary inference from the own∣ers <HI>Coming</HI> to this figtree, <HI>looking for fruit, and finding none,</HI> for if God be aimed at in this owner, as we have observed, he could not miss, or not find fruit, if there had bin any; Being omniscient.

one mentioned which is enough to intimate that such a thing may be, and so sufficient to put every one upon self-examination;) yet it is certian that it intimates that there are more.</P>

<ITEM>3. How this comes to pass.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Why God suffers such in the visible Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. For the evidence that there are such; nay more, that the biggest part of visible Pro∣fessors are for the most part such, we have warrant sufficient from the Scripture to con∣clude: nor do we find that the visible Church was ever without such since the be∣gining. In <HI>Adams</HI> family there was a <HI>Cain</HI> who offered unaccepted Sacrifice. In <HI>Noah's</HI> a Cursed <HI>Cham,</HI> whom the deluge had not washed from his wickedness. <HI>Abraham</HI> had a scoffing <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shmael,</HI> and <HI>Isaack</HI> a profane <HI>Esau.</HI> When <HI>Israel</HI> were in the Wilderness, and were accounted <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> yet there was many a vile wretch discovered, and a <HI>mixt multitude</HI> always rebelling against God. What they were afterwards, Gods frequent complaints by his Prophets, do sufficiently dis∣cover. How it was with his vineyard, we see, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. <HI>begin.</HI> And the application of it we have, <HI>verse.</HI> 5. and if we we shall descend
<PB N="76" REF="000581_0081_0FA710492E1FFFA8"/>
to Gospel times, we shall find it so; <HI>Christ</HI> himself when he was here, had a <HI>Judas</HI> in his own family; and what do the warnings and predictions of the Apostles signify, but that there were too many of these in the primitive Churches? and they warn us of worse and more degenerate times to come afterwards, but this will be most evidently discovered to us in the Consideration of the next thing; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="2">2. Who are so to be accounted?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In general, all those that doe not bear the right and proper fruit, will come under this denomination; and those are only the fruits of Righteousness and Holiness; all o∣thers are in Gods esteem barren: whatso∣ever fruits they <HI>bear to themselves,</HI> if they bring forth none to <HI>G</HI>od, they are <HI>Empty Hos.</HI> 10. 1. The fruits that God looks for in his Church are good works, acts of true O∣bedience to his revealed will; and to the making of such fruit there is a great deal re∣quired. It is necessary that <HI>the tree be good</HI> before the fruit can be so. Besides the mat∣ter of the action, that it be conformable to the Rule of Gods word, there must be a prin∣ciple of grace within from <HI>whence</HI> it must pro∣ceed, and saving Faith in the Soul to <HI>purify the heart,</HI> and to <HI>work by love,</HI> without which it is <HI>impossible to please</HI> G<HI>od, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>br,</HI> 11. 6. and it must be in conjunction with a sincere aim
<PB N="77" REF="000581_0082_0FA7104CD2794750"/>
at the Glory of God, as the ultimate scope of the action. It must be a work of the Sanctifying Spirit, and that it cannot be, if it fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of any of these ingredients; and hence in particular we may conclude, such as these to bear none; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. All <HI>Profane</HI> persons that are in the vi∣sible Church; and it is a matter of sad la∣mentation, that there are too many such, who call themselves Christians, and yet are always doing the <HI>works of the flesh,</HI> of which we have a Catalogue, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 19, &amp;c. they mind nothing that is good, but are wholly ad∣dicted to vanity and debauchery, and yet they can boast of their Church-priviledges, and bolster themselves up in wickedness by them: such were they, <HI>J</HI>er. 7. 9, 10. the very lives and conversations of these declared them to be graceless, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 9. the cursed fruits that they bear discover that they have an <HI>evil root of bitterness</HI> in them; and charity must put out its eyes, before it can think better of them: God will never acknowledge the <HI>vintage of Gomorrah</HI> to be fruit.</P>
<P N="2">2. All <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> These indeed make a shew as if they were green trees, and are full of the leaves of an outward profession: they carry it fair to men, and make a great stir in a profession, talk much of Religion, and frequent Ordinances with a great deal of seeming zeal: they are very good Christians
<PB N="78" REF="000581_0083_0FA7104E33B211E0"/>
as far as words will go; and possibly too they may have a shew of fruit upon them: they may do a great many things so far as the matter of duty reacheth and in that part of their conversation which lies open to the view and observation of men, may use much severity and strictness: but these are not the fruits that God accepts; they are not found b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t rotten. Our Saviour compares them to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pulchres, Mat.</HI> 23. 27, 28. These trees are not good, how then should their fruit be so? However they hope to recommend their lives to men, they do not approve their hearts to God: they labour; but it is to make a <HI>Spi∣ders web:</HI> their arms are wrong set; they seek not the glory of God, but <HI>to be seen of men;</HI> and they have all <HI>their reward</HI> when they have gotten the applause they desired, for God will reject them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>All Legallists.</HI> I distinguish these from Hypocrites, because the other are meer stage-players and dissemblers, whereas these are real and conscientious in what they do; they have an enlightened Conscience in them, and moral principles that are active, and they are led by them. The duties of first, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd second Table are carefully practised by them, and yet not, as the others to be seen of men meerly, but to answer their Consciences, and to earn Heaven and Hap∣piness: they are built upon the Old▪ Cove∣nant,
<PB N="79" REF="000581_0084_0FA7104E84E20BB8"/>
and hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to comply with the termes of it: or they make the <HI>G</HI>ospel but a Cove∣nant of works, and think that if they do their best, God will accept them, and this maketh them very laborious: but still, all this is not fruit, it needs something to make it of the right Kind; it is wrought by their own strength, and will prove loss. Of this stamp was <HI>Paul</HI> in his <HI>Pharisaism,</HI> but see what an esteem he set upon this after∣wards, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 4. &amp;c,</P>
<P N="4">4. In a word, all that are in a state of <HI>Unregeneracy.</HI> As long as men have no prin∣ciple of saving grace wrought in them by the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, they do not bear fruit; where there is not faith, there can be no exer∣cise of it; and whatsoever is not influenced by that, belongs to dead works; that which is such, is pleasing to God, he takes content in it; but these can do no such thing, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 8. <HI>They that are in the flesh cannot please God;</HI> and the Apostle assures us that <HI>all have not faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. How this comes to pass? It may seem strange that there should be empty plants in the Courts of Gods House, but we may be satisfied in this, when we have weighed the case: Hence;</P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Negatively. It is not because there is any thing wanting on Gods part as to means of fruitfulness. God can leave this
<PB N="80" REF="000581_0085_0FA7104F42DDA480"/>
to mens own Judgments, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will speak up∣rightly,</HI>1 Isa. 5. 3. 4. <HI>There are the same ad∣vantages afforded to one and the other in the Vi∣sible Church: they enjoy the same Gospel, and Ordinances, in which the Calls, Counsels, Invi∣vitdtions, Encouragements, are alike exhibited to them: the dresser of the Vineyard hath a charge given him concerning all, to look after them with care: the Ministry are appointed to de∣clare the whole counsel of God: they that bear no fruit live under the same means that they do who bear the most, and there is nothing more done med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately for the than another. It is the same word that Convinceth one and prejudiceth another; there is nothing is here to be said for it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Positively; let these things be ob∣served,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a natural barrenness unto good in all <HI>Adams</HI> Posterity. Man indeed was made at first in the Image of God, which was a fertile principle in him, and both enabled and disposed him to the Service of God; but the fall hath lost him that power, and as he comes into the world in a state of Apostasy, he could do nothing at all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accepta∣ble to <HI>G</HI>od; his soul is become such a soil, as no good plant will grow in it; it will bring forth nothing but thorns and thistles. Mans impotency to holy duties, is one part of the misery fallen upon him by sin; and
<PB N="81" REF="000581_0086_0FA71050005D9120"/>
it is such as hath left him neither ability nor disposition to it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 12. &amp;c. for if a man must be good in order to his be∣ing capable of doing good, the natural man is capable of doing none: for he <HI>is Conceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sin,</HI> &amp; <HI>goes astray from the</HI> W<HI>omb, speaking lies.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There are also Cursed Principles of Corruption in natural men, that help to encrease this barrenness. Original sin in man is not meerly morally Privative, or a disabling of man from doing good, by emp∣tying him of the Grace which he had at the first; but there is something Morally positive in it too, <HI>i. e.</HI> all the Moral pow∣ers of his Soul are habitually bent unto sin, <HI>his Heart is set in him to do Wickedly, Eccl.</HI> 8. 11. So that he can as well withhold from acting as from sinning; and by these re∣newed acts of such a principle, the habit is fortified, which adds to the barneness of the Soul a deeper rooting and confirmation in it; and nature, being strengthened by custom, is yet made more unlikely to do any thing that may answer <HI>G</HI>ods expectati∣on: it is more setled in its evil way: and therefore God puts stress upon this argu∣ment, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13. 23. <HI>q. d,</HI> Whatever might have bin hoped before, yet now they are next to hopeless.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence their Hearts do naturally and voluntarily resist the Spirit of God, striving
<PB N="82" REF="000581_0087_0FA710511E3834C0"/>
with them in the means. Instead of com∣plying with and entertaining of him, they do oppose him, and this men always do of themselves or by their own inclinations, <HI>Acts.</HI> 7. 51. The <HI>way of mens Hearts,</HI> and the <HI>sight of their eyes,</HI> to which they are addict∣ed, and that by a rooted approbation and choice, are quite contrary to the things that the Spirit of God invites men to in the Word and Ordinances; so that wheresoever he comes to make offers of them unto men, he finds a fixed enmity in them against these things, so that such not only will not, but they <HI>cannot be subject Rom.</HI> 8. 7. This is the <HI>fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts against the spirit,</HI> and needs must it be exceeding strong in natural men since in the regenerate, the remains of it often brings them into <HI>Captivity,</HI> and so it makes them that they <HI>cannot do the things that they would, Gal.</HI> 5. 17.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is also many times a great neg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct in Parents of doing their Duty to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Children, in order to their being fruitful. They love to have Church Priviledges for their Children; they cannot bear that they should not be acknowledged Christians, and not have the badge of Christs Covenant up∣on them; but alas! this is all they mind how woful neglects of Duty are there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such Parents? they do not teach their Chil∣dren the <HI>Principles of the Oracles of God,</HI> do
<PB N="83" REF="000581_0088_0FA71052F6E67950"/>
not counsel and <HI>command them to serve God,</HI> do not restrain them from the exorbitances that their youthful carnal minds naturally en∣cline them to, do not set them a good exam∣ple of Holiness, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t often give them an ill example▪ do not pray with them, nor see that they attend upon the means of grace, and give an account of their profiting: and Children thus left, will run after sin fast e∣nough; and God also thus punisheth Parent's neglects.</P>
<P N="5">5. They oftentimes fall into Snares and Temptations from Satan and his Instruments. The Devil hath a peculiar Design upon the Church of Christ; the <HI>gates of hell</HI> set them∣selves against it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the means of grace are most clearly dispensed, and the best en∣deavours are used to bring Souls unto Christ, Hell is most of all allarmed, and Satan useth all manner of stratagems to hold such in his hands; and if, whilst they are visibly Christs, he can keep them spiritually his own, his ends are answered. He hath also his Agents, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ud persons, whom he employs, to tempt, allure, and drew men away, especially young persons, into vain company, to evil practices. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd such things as may keep them from se∣riousness, and engage them to the lusts of their own hearts; and if any word comes close to their Consciences at any time, these <HI>Fowls readily pick it up.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="84" REF="000581_0089_0FA71053AEB2BE10"/>
6. There is often a Judicial Blinding and Hardning fails upon them, by Gods righteous Judgment, God affords them row<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and awakening means, and they sleep under them, and harden their hearts against them, and will not comply with his calls and counsels, and God hereupon sends them a penal hard∣ness, whereby they are confirmed in it, so it was with them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 11, 12. and such an one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 4. yea this was the amazing errand which God told the Prophet that he sent him upon, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6. 9, 10. and how can such bear fruit, when Christ saith to them as he did to the fig-tree, <HI>Never more let fruit be found on thee?</HI> Now all these things may satisfie us how it may so be, that all the means may fail, as to mens being fruitful under the enjoyment of them. But then the question still remains, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="4">4. Why <HI>G</HI>od suffers such in his visible Church? this may also seem a mistery. That he sees, and knows them, yea observes them we have heard; and that they do not answer his expectation, and for that reason must needs be a provocation to him: Why then should he let them be there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In general; God knows how to ad∣vance his <HI>G</HI>lory, and gain his ends by them in thus doing. Gods last end in all he doth is his own glory, he hath a name to get by his works; and there are various ways in
<PB N="85" REF="000581_0090_0FA710546D1123D0"/>
which he promoves it. As there are divers Attributes which he displays to us, so there are divers Subjects in which he will have them exalted, and whatsoever serves to the exalta∣tion of these, proportionably to the cost that is laid out upon it, is not in vain: now that God both can and will do so in this affair, will be more particularly seen in the conside∣ration of these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>G</HI>od hereby declares his great <HI>Patience.</HI> This is one of the Perfections of God, which he sets an high price upon: he tells us that he is a <HI>G</HI>od that bears, and for bears, and <HI>en∣dures sinners with much long-suffering;</HI> and it mightily commends him to the souls of his people that he is so; the discoveries which they make of it, are to them matter of great encouragement; and in none is it more evi∣dently made to appear, than in these: that fruitless trees should be let alone in the Vine∣yard, and have all the protection and hus∣bandry of it afforded to them; and though still they abide barren, yet they are not pre∣sently cut down, but suffered there, this is great patience. It is nothing so much to hear with a wicked world, that have not these means; these are therefore called <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ches of</HI> G<HI>ods Goodness, Rom.</HI> 2. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hereby he discovers the great wickedness which is in the hearts of men; it would never have been known how vile men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are▪ if they had

not lived under the means of grace. and there been waited upon with all the offers of grace, &amp; endeavours with them for their good. For men to</HI> Transgress in a Land of Uprightness, <HI>to sin against all the counsels, warnings, invitations, encouragements, obligations, of the Gospel, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op of wickedness: and this mightily clears up the righteousness of the Judgment of</HI> G<HI>od against ungodly men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This also discovers to his people evidently, that it is by G</HI>race <HI>that</HI> they are saved, <HI>Godly men have by this means before them continually such monuments as the very looking on them, helps to convince them that it is</HI> not of themselves, but the gift of God, <HI>that they are made fruit∣ful; when they see them of the same nature with them, under the same dispensations, not∣withstanding all to abide in their impenitency, and live unprofitably under all the advantages of profiting; it tells them what hearts and natures they have in them, and how much they owe to the praise of Gods Grace,</HI> that hath made them to differ.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hereby these also are prepared to be the more eminent instances of Gods <HI>Reveng∣ing Justice.</HI> Not only God's Grace, but his Justice too, are to be eminently exalted in the visible Church: here are to be sound the more stupendous monuments of his severity, where his <HI>mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y works</HI> have been done, and men have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> It is not so much i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> as <HI>Chorazin,</HI> &amp;c. not so much in <HI>Sodom</HI> or <HI>Capernaum.</HI> There are they who by their despising and abusing the greatest mercies of God, do lay up the more <HI>treasures of wrath</HI> against themselves; and therefore, when Christ comes to Judgment, there is a peculiar vengeance, is to be taken upon such, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sometimes God doth it for <HI>Gracious Ends,</HI> to make the more convincing displays of his rich G<HI>race</HI> in them. God sometimes suffers barren trees to grow a long while in his Vineyard, till one would think that all the hopes of their bearing were now pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; and they have bin dying and rotting so long till we were almost concluding them to be past recovery and after this he comes and Magni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fies his Mercy upon them, in recove∣ring of them by a saving conversion, and they are, as it were, <HI>born out of time.</HI> Such an one <HI>Paul</HI> tells us he was: and by this means the great efficacy, and mighty influence of his grace, comes to be made known, and his name is praised, by and for them.</P>

<P><HI>And let it awaken all to see to our selves that we be fruitful.

<PB N="90" REF="000581_0095_0FA7105D747C6AA8"/>
concerns every individual to do so for himself &amp; there are these three arguments that should move us hereunto.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Consider that God expects fruit of e∣very one in his Church. He looks for it, &amp; you can no otherwise answer the end of your being set there. This hath been already e∣videnced, and it hath a mighty plea in it; for doth not <HI>G</HI>od deserve it of you? Is it not an ill requital of all his care and cost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid out upon you, to deny it to him? is it not the most unreasonable thing that you should stand within the fence, and take up room in the ground, and be of no profit at all?</P>
<P N="2">2. And <HI>G</HI>od observes as well as expects: and should not this be a consideration of weight with you, to think that whatever I am doing, Gods jealous eye is upon me: if I am barren, he keeps the account of that, and if I am fruitful, he will not forget that: He that knows that he is always under the watch∣ful inspection of the great <HI>G</HI>od, had need to be careful of himself.</P>
<P N="3">3. And if you be not fruitful, he will not always bear it: and this your very reason may assure you of: though he be patient, yet be can be weary with for bearing: and this is a solemn consideration, &amp; should carry great aw in it to all our hearts, you cannot promise your selves always to be indulged, unless <HI>good∣ness
<PB N="91" REF="000581_0096_0FA7105E3892ECE8"/>
leads you to repentance.</HI> And for your help here.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be sensible of your native barrenness, and go to God to remove it: sense of impo∣tency is the first step to profitableness: A proud opinion of our own righteousness, is the main <HI>remora</HI> to our Conversion. God on∣ly <HI>can teach us to profit;</HI> when a barren heart is felt, and burdensome, he is ready to af∣ford his help to all those that come to him, and pray against it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Beware of hearkning to Satan, and re∣sisting the Spirit of God. This is the un∣doing of multitudes under the <HI>G</HI>ospel; Sa∣tan enveagles them with his Temptations, and they comply with them: the Spirit of God comes and solicits them and they regard him not. Hearken to him, and he will <HI>work your works in and for you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Improve the means with diligence. The means of Grace are sutable, but if they be neglected they will not profit us. Hearken to Counsel, take warning, receive instruction, embrace the Encouragements given you, and apply all to practice.</P>

<Q>Then said be unto the Dresser of his Vineyard; behold, these three years I come see∣king fruit of this figtree, and find none, cut it down, why cambreth it the ground.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>III WE now proceed to consider the deliberation of the Owner of the Vineyard with the dresser of it; in which there are two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The complaint which he makes against this Particular fig-tree.</P>
<P N="2">2. The advice which he gives to him a∣bout it.</P>
<P>The Person spoken to is called the Dresser of the Vineyard. Men were wont often to keep their Gardeners, to look after their vines and fruit-trees, that were skilled in that sort of Husbandry: and this cannot be meant of God, whom else-where Christ cal∣leth <HI>The Husbandman, Joh.</HI> 15. 1. for it hath
<PB N="94" REF="000581_0099_0FA70F5A508B88E0"/>
been already observed that he is intended by the Owner. Some apply this to Christ, un∣to whom there is given a Mediatorial Dis∣pensation of all affairs that concern his Church: but I rather suppose that it aims at the Ministry of the Gospel, whom it is cer∣tain that Jesus Christ, who is the Lord and Planter of this vineyard, employs in the manuring of his visible Church: they are therefore said to be <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nters</HI> and <HI> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erers,</HI> I Cor. 3, 6. and to be <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onrers together with God,</HI> chap. 4. 1.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the consideration of the deliberation it self, give me leave to make a few brief glancing remarks, upon the person deliberated withal, <ABBR>viz</ABBR> the <HI>Dresser of the vine∣yard.</HI> And here we may observe;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The dignity which Christ puts upon his Ministry, and the trust which he puts in them.</HI> It is a great honour that is done unto men to put them into places of trust. God hath a singular respect to, and care which he takes of his Church; to betrust any then with the office of looking after and dressing of this Vineyard, argues a great deal of confidence that he puts in them, and honour that he confers upon them. God is a great King, and these are his Children, for to them <HI>per∣tains the Adoption;</HI> and it is a noble employ∣ment to be made Tutors to a King's Chil∣dren: men are wont to be curious in their
<PB N="95" REF="000581_0100_0FA70F5AB4311D50"/>
choice of such: and God is much more, in the directions which he hath given about the qualifications of such whom he will ac∣cept in this station. <HI>Moses</HI> mentions it as a great preferment which God had advanced <HI>Korah</HI> and his Brethren unto, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 9.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence they who despise the office and work of the Ministry, despise God. Such as reproach them, reproach God himself. It is not to be denied, but that there are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who are preferred among men to the place of the Ministry, whose unworthy Car∣riage in it, and mismanagement of it, makes them deserve to be exploded, and not acknow∣ledged to be called by God, or approved of him: but this ought not to be interpre∣ted as redounding to the ignominy of the work it self, or the contempt of those whom God hath made faithful in it. It is true, Christ could do his work without them, but he hath pleased to chuse this way to dis∣pense himself in; and that employment which <HI>G</HI>od himself hath seen meet to put honour upon, ought not to be vilified or thought light of, by such as profess them∣selves to be his people, and to hope for his salvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are here also <HI>acquainted with the Duty of Gospel Ministers.</HI> The Title her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put upon them, is not only a character of their <HI>dignity,</HI> but of their <HI>duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Their
<PB N="96" REF="000581_0101_0FA70F5B91F38CF0"/>
work is to dress the Vineyard. The word signifies <HI>one that is to work about the vines; i.e.</HI> to do the business that appertains to the tending and looking after them: and this intimates that there is no little care and charge lying upon those that are engaged in the Ministry, no little labour incumbent on them to be exercised withal; and this will appear from the consideration of two things in the Comparison or Title.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Vineyard hath a great many plants in it, all of which belongs to the Vine-dressers care, and every one of which calls for dres∣sing. A Church is a Company of visible believers, or professors, with their Children, in some there are more, in others fewer: now each individual of these belongs to his Charge; and it is a solemn Charge that Christ hath laid upon him, 2, <HI>Tim</HI> 4. <HI>begin▪</HI> A Seasonable administration belongs to these and to that end, care is to be used to <HI>know the state</HI> of the Vineyard; and that is by the several plants which are in it, Not only Truths, but seasonable Truths are to be preached; and he that hath souls to look after, must needs have a great care lying up∣on him.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a deal to be done to and for the Vineyard, and the several plants that are in it. He that hath a Vineyard to look after, shall never want work: there
<PB N="97" REF="000581_0102_0FA70F5C51FC62A8"/>
are so many things that belong to the dressing &amp; tending of it; there is digging, &amp; du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng∣ing, and weeding, and transplanting, &amp; pru∣ning, and under-setting, and keeping up the hedge, and watching against wild beasts and robbers: and all this is a constant work; if it be once done. It will be to do again and again. There is no less lying on the Mini∣sters of Christ, if they will prove themselves faithful: there are <HI>Children,</HI> tender plants in the nursery, to be looked after, and to be re∣moved from those beds into the rows, when they are fitted for it: there are <HI>grown per∣sons,</HI> who should be laboured with that they may be prepared for full communion: and there are those that have <HI>attained</HI> to it: each of these have their portion to be allotted to them. There are the <HI>unbelieving,</HI> who are to be called upon and not let alone; the <HI>Obsti∣nate,</HI> who are to be solemnly warned; the <HI>Scandalous,</HI> who are to be, according to their merit, censured; the <HI>Careless,</HI> that are to be seasonably reproved; the <HI>Sorrowful,</HI> that must be comforted; the <HI>doubting Souls,</HI> that must be satisfied; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is the Word and Ordinances which are to be dispensed to all in publick; the <HI>sick</HI> that must be visited; <HI>Corrupters and Seducers</HI> must be watched a∣gainst; Families in private must be visited; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and an account is to be given in to Christ the Lord and Owner of his Church,
<PB N="98" REF="000581_0103_0FA70F5D189D0298"/>
of all this, as they expect a reward of <HI>G</HI>race at his hands: and if they have wilfully neg∣lected or omitted their duty in these regards, they are in danger of being <HI>cut in sunder</HI> by him, and made to receive their <HI>portion wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hypocrites.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Hence how much do they mistake who think the work of the Ministry to be an easy employment?

<P>Pity and pray for, and encourage Christ's Ministers in their work.

How often have we <HI>Paul</HI> importunately asking it of the Churches whom he writes unto? little do you know the sore Temptations, mighty discou∣ragements, and many sinking thoughts which these Servants of Christ struggle withal, through sense of their own frailty, and the greatness of the work incumbent on them, and the solemnity of the Charge under the aw whereof they are, and the trembling thoughts of the amazing account they must shortly give in to the Lord Jesus Christ: give them then many a lift, by your ardent sup∣plications for them. One of the Ancients

<P N="3">3.

<P N="1">1. A Minister is then to be acknow∣ledged faithful to his office relation, when he doth conscientiously attend all the duties of it, as he hath opportunity and ability. Fi∣delity in any duty, of any relation, must b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon in an Evangelical Sense, else the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must cry, <HI>Lord enter not into Judgment.</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="000581_0106_0FA70F62E3FBF1D0"/>
Faithfulness appears in a care to mind the work we are in, to discharge the trust re∣posed in us, to spend and be spent in the work of Christ, and for the good of Souls▪ to be <HI>instant in season and out of season?</HI> To divide to every one the portion belonging to them, rebuke to whom rebuke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And all this as God gives them strength and ad∣vantage, not shunning any thing which God hath Commanded them to do.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there are such placed by Christ in his Church, is evident. The love and care which Christ hath for it, cannot but put him upon it to provide such for it: and when his people have bin never so degenerate, and offered the greatest affronts to such as these, he hath yet sent them, and enabled them to bear all, and discharge their duty notwithstanding: It is he that <HI>thrusts out labourers into his harvest;</HI> and he can make them labourers indeed: there have bin such formerly; <HI>Paul</HI> was so, he could appeal to the consciences of this <HI>Ephesians.

and diligent, and have his spirit upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. That these notwithstanding all their faithfulness, may miss of the desired success of their Ministry. This is signified in the Text, and witnessed to by the Scripture, and constant experience; and there may be a ra∣tional account given of this, if we consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is not their fidelity, but Gods blessing which gives the success. They are but Instruments used by <HI>G</HI>od: their desires may be sincere, their endeavours hearty, and industrious; but the hearts of men are not to be wrought upon by them, but require Al∣mighty Power to influence them.

servants on the most unsuccessful er∣rand. The direct end of the Ministry, is the Conversion and Salvation of men; but God sometimes judicially orders it otherwise. What a famous industrious and Evangelical Prophet was <HI>Isaiah?</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yet see how his Commission runs, <HI>Isa,</HI> 6. 9, 10.

There is a Soveraign over-ruling hand of God in these affairs, and it is to be adored by us: to have nothing else to alled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e against any of Gods Servants, but that there is little good done by all his labour, and possibly a people do grow worse under it, and therefore he is not true to his trust, and there be nothing else that appears against him, is an Harsh censure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if they by their own vertue and good

will could make men good when they please. It may be their affliction and sore grief, when it is not their sin; and calls for pity rather then Censure; to see them <HI>casting out</HI> the <HI>G</HI>ospel <HI>not</HI> so often, and <HI>toyling all night and catching little or nothing:</HI> their hearts have Sorrow enough already, for this they need not to be loaded with more: thus might <HI>Isaiah, Jeremiah Ezekiel,</HI> yea and <HI>Christ</HI> himself have been censured.</P>

<P>This may teach us not to place too much upon men. It is a fault too frequent, and of dangerous consequence, for us to tarry at Instruments, and either on the one hand to adore them, or on the other to undervalue them. It is true, the Gifts, graces, indust∣ry, prudence, which God bestows upon them are to be acknowledged: but <HI>to have any mans person in admiration,</HI> to the contempt of o∣thers, as if this must needs be the conver∣ting man, and not the other, is to dishonour God, and give away his incommunicable glo∣ry to a Creature: nor can we do such men a greater displeasure: <HI>Paul</HI> is as much dis∣satisfied at them, who said they were for <HI>Paul,</HI> as those that were for <HI>Apollos;</HI> because they put too much respect upon him.</P>

<P>Hence fidelity and not bare success shall be the Ministers trial and crown another day. I confess, that here in this life, they that bring in many to Christ, have abundance of joy, and are highly beloved by them that have experienced saving good by them; and they that comfort few or none, have abun∣dance of grief and sorrow. But when they shall come to stand before Christ's Tribu∣nal, and are to receive their reward, that man shall have no more commendation than this: he did no more for God, though <HI>G</HI>od did more by him: nay, if there be degrees of reward according to what men have done and suffered for Christ, I am sure this man hath done as much, and suffered more: and if this were not the support of the hearts of some of Gods Servants, they would sometimes saint within them, Christ comforted himself with this, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. 5. <HI>Though Israel be not ga∣thered, I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We may here finally observe, <HI>That God oftentimes signifies his displeasure against unpro∣fitable Professors, to his faithful Ministers.</HI> Thus is the Owner of the Vineyard here brought in, deliberating with the Vine-dresser, com∣plaining against, and threatning of the fig∣tree.
<PB N="106" REF="000581_0111_0FA70F65FB5D7AB0"/>
How God signified his mind of old to his Prophets, is plainly intimated in Scrip∣ture, he used to appear to them in <HI>dreams, vi∣sions by Angels, &amp;c.</HI> whence their Prophesies were delivered in the <HI>Name of the Lord:</HI> and sometimes they were against the body of the people, when there was a general degenera∣cy, sometimes against particular persons. How he discovers himself in these respects to his Servants in Gospel-times, since extraor∣dinary Revelations are ceased, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay seem to be more difficult to apprehend: only we are told that we have a more sure word of Pro∣phesie: and out of doubt there is still a truth in that which is expressed, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 7.</P>
<P>Those of Gods servants that have ob∣tained Grace to be faithful, as they are ex∣ceeding desirous to do good, so they cannot but be very observant to see what success their labours have; and as to the general state and frame of the people they are sent to, it is practically obvious, by the enter∣tainment they give to, and improvement they make of the means of <HI>G</HI>race which are affor∣ded them. As to particulars indeed, there may be some who notoriously discover them∣selves by their lewd lives, &amp; profligate car∣riages; others may act more closely, and make a fair shew, when indeed they are un∣fruitful, and so impose upon their belief and charity; and yet some of these do often ren∣der
<PB N="107" REF="000581_0112_0FA70F66B8D7E910"/>
themselves very suspicious. Now God herein mainly signifies his mind to his Mi∣nisters in this respect, not by telling them this and that in particular is an Hypocrite, &amp; hath no true grace in him; but he touch∣eth their hearts with an appearn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion of his displeasure, and stirs them up providentially to give warning to his people and tell them of their danger, &amp; to be much &amp; frequent in insisting upon these themes: and it is an observation worthy of remark, that when God is about to manage a Controversie ei∣ther more publick, or more personal, there are unaccountable applications in the Ordinan∣ces unto such, which oftentimes put men into admiration, and if the reason of this be asked, it may be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>G</HI>od is wont to give Sinners in the Visible Church, fair warning, before he falls upon them in his wrath. It is a pri∣viledge of sinners that are under the means of Grace, to be told of their sins and have the denunciations of <HI>G</HI>ods wrath laid before them, before it siezeth them, that so to∣gether with a space to repent, they may have a loud call unto it: and this appertains to the singular long suffering of God, which he extends to such, and will render them the more inexcusable, if at last they by their impenitency force him to make <HI>a way for his anger;</HI> he therefore first <HI>slays them by the mouth
<PB N="108" REF="000581_0113_0FA70F67799A8948"/>
of his Prophets,</HI> before he executes his ven∣geance upon them in his Providence; and because he useth his Ministers as Instruments, by whom he gives these warnings to his peo∣ple, he therefore moves their hearts to eye and observe, and be deeply affected with the things that give him provocation, and accor∣dingly guides their studies and meditations that way.</P>
<P N="2">2. God often doth it with gracious pur∣poses, sometimes to his Ministers, to quicken them to a more earnest and repeated diligent endeavour for the people, both by interpo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing with God in their more ardent prayers to him for his Patience, and farther to call upon such, and by more particular and solemn en∣deavours with sinners to quicken and awaken them to their duty; and by this means, <HI>whe∣ther they will hear or forbear,</HI> these will have the more peace in the issue, that they have used their best endeavours to do them good; and if they have any grace in them, such ap∣prehensions will raise it up, and put it upon more than ordinary vigour and improvement, in labouring for and with sinners, whose dan∣ger they see and fear. Sometimes to unfruit∣ful sinners themselves, by giving a blessing to such endeavours, and perswading them to hearken to their solemn counsels, and accept of the calls to Repentance, that being ren∣dred fruitful, he may have mercy upon them
<PB N="109" REF="000581_0114_0FA70F6945E25518"/>
and spare them: and when it is so, his spirit sets in with, and gives efficacy to these en∣deavours.</P>

<P>Let this then be a word of warning to all Unprofitable ones. If Gods servants <HI>who have obtained</HI> G<HI>race to be faithful,</HI> are at any time spirited and engaged more par∣ticularly to bear a Testimony against your barrenness, and solemnly to declare your danger to you, and press the many threat∣nings of Gods word upon you; do not you flight or neglect it; count it not a light matter, or only a pang of their Zeal; but think with your selves, <HI>G</HI>od hath been taking notice of me with a jealous eye, he is highly provoked at my so long remaining unfruitful, and is now sending me this rowzing message to alarm me, and give me an opportunity, which if I neglect, I must ex∣pect some sudden wrath to fall upon me. If his servants are thus afraid of his Judge∣ments coming, well may I, who ly so wo∣fully open to them, do not say they speak at random, of their own heads, or vent their passions, or discover their wishes: no, If they fear God, they desire the good of your souls, and that you may be Saved

<HEAD>SERMON VII</HEAD>
<P>WE have been considering the Person deliberated with, it follows that we take notice of the deliberation it self▪ in which as hath been observed, there are two things to be handled distinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. The complaint of the Owner against this particular fig-tree, in which he gives the ground and reason of the following sentence which he pronounceth.</P>
<P>In which observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. The great pains and patience which he had used with this tree in expectation of its bearing: the Patience is expressed in that he had waited three years upon it, suffering it all this while, in hope that it would bear in so long a time at least why our Saviour useth the definite number of three, is divers∣ly guessed; some think that he aims at the three years of his publick Ministry, which at had spent in that work, when this Para∣ble
<PB N="112" REF="000581_0117_0FA70F6B394295A8"/>
was uttered, and the year requested in the following verse, to aim at the fourth cur∣rent, in which he suffered: others suppose it to aim at the nature of the fig-tree, which if it be not wholly barren, will bear at least once in three years and then it intends that God had waited upon the sinner as long as there were, any rational hopes of his receiv∣ing good, or profiting; or till there was <HI>no</HI> apparent <HI>remedy,</HI> as the Scripture sometimes phraseth it. Not that the day of grace is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be limited to three years, but during <HI>G</HI>ods pleasure, and his pains is intimated, in that all this while he kept coming and looking; which signifies the frequent reiterated means of grace that are used With sinners, and the often applications of the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, to them, during the day of Patience.</P>
<P N="2">2. The missing of his expectation after all this; <HI>and find none:</HI> and that is the aggrava∣tion of the provocation, that not only at first coming, but after so often coming, it re∣mained still as it was, unfruitful.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>phasis put upon this complaint; <HI>looked:</HI> the word is sometimes used as a note of attention, when some observable thing is pointed at, and therefore it is also often used as a note of <HI>Admiration,</HI> when some strange thing that is to be wondred at is <HI>mentioned which calls</HI> for <HI>Astonishment</HI> from the <HI>Beholders.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="000581_0118_0FA70F6EEFCA44A8"/>
There are two <HI>Observations lie plain in</HI> the words.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE I. <HI>That God keeps an exact account of all the Pati∣ence and Pains that he useth with sinners un∣der the Gospel, and the improvement which they make thereof.</HI> </HEAD>
<P>Thus is the Landlord here brought in making of particular remarks upon what he had done; and what he had observed.</P>
<P>There are several <HI>Propositions</HI> contained in this Doctrine, a brief explication of which will serve for the clearing up the Truth contained in it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I:</HEAD>
<P>That <HI>G</HI>od useth a great deal of Patience with some sinners under the Gospel. Though he affords them the means of Grace, and they do not presently give them due enter∣tainment, but neglect them, yet he doth not always presently fall upon, and cut them∣off
<PB N="114" REF="000581_0119_0FA70F6F0605E2A8"/>
from these means, but suffers them to live a great while under them, and waits upon them. Here observe.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Patience of God is Soveraign and Arbitray. It is an act of his meer good pleasure: as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ows to no sinners a room in his Vineyard, or so much as an offer of Grace; so, upon their neglecting to im∣prove the means, and refusing the offers of Grace made to them, he might righteously take away his Gospel from them, or them from it; and although he would be severe, yet he would be very just. The New-Cove∣nant is a Covenant of Grace, and all that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done for men in it, is therefore free: as he acts his pleasure in chusing who shall be put in∣to the Vineyard, he doth it no less in <HI>determi∣ning</HI> their continuance in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. This patience is exerted towards some and not all. As <HI>G</HI>od is Soveraign so he makes use of his Soveraignty, to let us know that he is so. How many are there that are born in places where the Gospel is enjoyed, who never live to years of understanding, to have any offer of Grace made to them; of whom, though God can work his Grace in them by his spirit, and hath given godly pa∣rents good reason to hope well concerning them, (but this dispensation is a secret;) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this is a truth, that they are taken out of the Vineyard, before they are capable of the moral
<PB N="115" REF="000581_0120_0FA70F703B90AC28"/>
means used in it. We find also such to whom the Gospel hath been offered, and at their, first refusal of it they have been discarded, <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 45, 46. yea such an injunction Christ laid upon his Disciples; <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence also God useth his pleasure in the timing his Patience to these and those. All that are waited upon have not the same mea∣sure of the day of grace, and season for bear∣ing fruit; but some a longer, and some a shorter time, having no other bounds, but his will: nor hath he told any sinners how long it shall be: he would not have any such to presume, but calls all to improve the present time; doth not acquaint them when he will put an end to his Patience if they repent not: some sinners are cut down in their full strength, others are suffered to live and grow: old, and all this while God is patient, he bears and forbears, for there is no hour in which they are open not to his displeasure, and giving him provocation to fall upon them in his anger: &amp; there are some whom he will make to experience his <HI>forbearance to the utter∣most,</HI> Rom. 9. 23.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<P>That in this day of Patience, God takes a great deal of pains with sinners, to engage
<PB N="116" REF="000581_0121_0FA70F7076639D50"/>
them unto fruitfulness. The Owner did not only tarry three years, but he was all this while <HI>coming, i. e.</HI> upon all occasions; and he comes to <HI>seek fruit.</HI> Gods coming to sinners under the <HI>G</HI>ospel, doth not intend a meer observation, but also the endeavours that he useth with them for their good, in the application of means to them in such a way as to invite and encourage them; and this will be evident if we consider, when God may properly be said to come? Gods coming is not to be understood only in respect of his Omnipresence, for that all Beings are equally sharers in, but it intends his application of himself to them for the perswading of them to Repentance. There is therefore an out∣ward, and an inward coming here to be taken notice of.</P>
<P N="1">1. God comes outwardly to men in his Or∣dinances, and in his Providences. These are the external means which he makes use of, which are suited to the nature of man, and have a voice of God in them. The Ordi∣nances are primarily so, being appointed of God to discover his mind and meaning to the children of men; in which he reveals to them the way of profiting; declares what is his will and their Duty; shews them their native barrenness, and where their fruit is to be had; calls upon them to attend the thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their peace, warns them of the dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="117" REF="000581_0122_0FA70F71347D3D98"/>
of neglect, sets before them the gracious en∣couragements of Obedience, and is continu∣ally putting them in mind of the things which they are apt to forget. God indeed useth the Ministry of men in these respects, but they are <HI>Ambassadors</HI> that represent God himself, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 20. to <HI>hearken</HI> to them, is to <HI>hearken</HI> to him; to <HI>despise</HI> them, is to <HI>de∣spise</HI> him. Thus God comes every Sabbath; and Lecture; in every Ordinance that is Dis∣pensed, every Sermon that is Preached, eve∣ry counsel and warning that is privately gi∣ven, <HI>Jer.</HI> 25. 4. 7. Providences are so secon∣darily, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> as they are used by <HI>G</HI>od to back his Ordinances, and lay men under the more sensible obligations to hearken and yield O∣bedience to them; the <HI>Rod</HI> is therefore said to be have a <HI>voice</HI> in it, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 6. 9. and it is God that speaks by it to the children of men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God comes also inwardly to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> &amp; that is by his secret strivings with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts in these Ordinances and Providences. There are the near approaches of God to them, which though others discern not, yet they themselves cannot but be sen∣sible of. The Spirit of God strave with the old</HI> W<HI>orld in the Ministry of</HI> Noah. <HI>They that re∣sist the Gospel are said to</HI> resist the Holy Ghost, Act. 7. 51. <HI>and that not only because they who preach it are</HI> C<HI>ommissioned by him to their work, but also because he himself comes in and with it,
<PB N="118" REF="000581_0123_0FA70F7239589A60"/>
and moves upon the hearts of men, leaves some touches there, which are for their awakening, and put them under Conviction, and upon considerati∣on: There are oftentimes secret whispers in mens Souls, which say to them, this is your concern, which fasten this and that cord upon them; which under such Providences as they met with, makes them to reflect and consider, which put them upon purposing and promising, or at least upon thought∣ful deliberation with themselves: and as long as it is so, God is coming inwardly as well us out∣wardly. It is true, this inward application i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not tied to the outward; sinners therefore are not, by every word or rod, put upon such thoughts; but it is often so, nor doth this always last as long as the other; men may have sinned away the spirit from coming in the Ordinances unto their hearts, whilst God yet sees meet to be com∣ing to them in outward dispensations; but whilst both these are continued to them, this is that which is properly their day of Grace.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P N="2">2. That God keeps an exact account of all this patience, and these pains. He hath a Book of memorial, in which he enters upon the record all his layings out upon them. Books of Register are in the Scrip∣ture ascribed to <HI>G</HI>od, after the manner of
<PB N="119" REF="000581_0124_0FA70F740A8C68B0"/>
men, to intimate to us, that he hath the ex∣act account of such things with him, that he keeps them in remembrance, and forgets none of them. For this reason we have him so of∣ten, in his word, giving his people close hints of what he had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n doing for them at this &amp; that time, and how long he had bin at it, <HI>Jer</HI> 25.2. and else-where. He observes and keeps the account how many Sermons they have heard, what Counsels were given to them here and there, how many Sabbaths, they have had the advantage of, how many of his servants he hath sent to speak to them, what they said; how many applications his spirit hath made to their souls, how long it is from the first day to this And if any shall enquire, what makes God so accurate in re∣cording these memorials, There are two reasons for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. God sets an high value upon these fa∣vours of his which he thus affords unto men. He looks upon them to be extraordinary kindnesses, That any should be planted in his Vineyard, and there have the priviledge of all the tendance of it: he therefore saith of such, that he hath known them after a singular manner, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 2. and there is ne∣ver a day wherein men are spared notwith∣standing their unprofitableness, never an ap∣proach that he makes to them, but it is of great worth: they are favours which carry
<PB N="120" REF="000581_0125_0FA70F74499FC2A8"/>
in them singular demonstrations of his good will, and they bring with them the greatest advantages to the children of men, who de∣serve none of them: God challengeth men, if they can to tell him, <HI>What he could have done more for them:</HI> well then may he keep the records of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>G</HI>od intends to call sinners that have neglected them, to an account about them. They are indeed free favours, if we consider our merit, and we could never have claimed them, or Gods liberty who had no obligati∣on from us to bestow them upon us: but they are not so free as to be forgotten, or as if we were no way concerned whe∣ther we use or abuse them: no, in the day of accounts, which is coming, they are all to be reckoned for. When the Lord made up the reckoning with his <HI>Servants,</HI> he dealt with each of them according to the number of <HI>Talents</HI> which they had received of him. Sabbaths, Sermons, and Sacraments; and Mercies, and afflictions must be answered for. Now that a true Reckoning may be made, an exact account must be kept, men must be made Debtors in Gods Book for all these Items; they must be charged in order to their being answered for; and that they may so be, they must be Registred.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="121" REF="000581_0126_0FA70F75066807A8"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITION IV.</HEAD>
<P>That <HI>G</HI>od also keeps the reckoning of all the improvement which men make of these patient endeavours of his. We are there∣fore told what remark the Owner made on his fig-tree, after his so long coming and seeking fruit: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and this is to be made at the foot of every visit that he made: he came in such an Ordinance at such a time; and lookt that there should be fruit upon it, <HI>and found none;</HI> and at another time, <HI>and found none;</HI> and <HI>toties quoties:</HI> Not only that they are barren at last, but how they are so progressively; how they continue to be so from time to time, and then put the whole series together. Thus we have one piece of Gods account on this matter drawn out, <HI>Amos</HI> 4. 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if the reason of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be asked, it will be evident, if we consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the account which God calls them unto is in order to recompense. For this cause the day of Judgment is called the day <HI>of Recompense.</HI> The Apostle tells as upon what account it is that <HI>we must all appear</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 10. When therefore Our Saviour gives as a description of the <HI>G</HI>reat day, <HI>Math.</HI> 25. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he determines it in the distribution of re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ards to men; and this must be made with
<PB N="122" REF="000581_0127_0FA70F75B4AD7170"/>
respect to their bearing, or barrenness. Re∣wards have always an eye unto something that is done, it is not therefore enough that God observes and remembers what he nath done for men, but he also must have on the o∣ther side the account of what they have done: how else shall the accounts be adjusted between them; or by what rule shall he give them their rewards? especially if we consi∣der.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there are two sorts of plants in Gods Vineyard, whose recompenses are diffe∣rent. God therefore must not only observe what he doth for them, but how they carry themselves under it. There is a reward of Grace, and a reward of Vengeance, a recom∣pense of Life, and of Death; there are some that do bear fruit, that do improve the pati∣ence and layings out of God faithfully, and for these there is a <HI>C</HI>racious remuneration; blessedness is secured to them by promise, and they must receive it: but there are o∣thers that neglect the means, and instead of yeilding the good fruits of holiness, do bring forth the vile fruits of sin, and by that means <HI>turn the Grace of God into wantonness;</HI> these are to be rewarded with misery; there are punishments appointed for them. These therefore must be distinguished and known each from the other, which calls for this particular account; and the rather, if we yet farther add,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="123" REF="000581_0128_0FA70F76A2E11B90"/>
3. That mens recompenses are to be pro∣portioned according unto their rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and improvements. There is not only a distri∣bution of rewards, to be made, according as men are found fruitful or barren; but they are to be measured according to the degres of either. It is true, the recompenses of fruit∣fulness are of meer grace, and there is no∣thing we can do, that will earn any degree of happiness for us; but yet if God please to proportion glory hereafter, according as he measures out grace here, who shall forbid him? if the Lord will say to him that hath <HI>gained ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alents; rule over ten Cities,</HI> and to him that hath <HI>gained five talents, rule over five Cities,</HI> it is as he sees meet: and if he will thus encourage endeavours in us, it is his Grace. But as to unfruitful ones, it is cer∣tain that every offer of grace despised, is a new provocation, every Sabbath neglected is a farther affront offered to the goodness of God, and should he not make these mens suf∣ferings to be accordingly greater, than theirs who had less time, and fewer endeavours u∣sed with them, he would be a loser in some of his works, which he must not be. The Declarative <HI>G</HI>lory of God then calls for it: and because he will have glory answerable to his expenses, he must keep the account: hence we read of his rewarding <HI>men according to
<PB N="124" REF="000581_0129_0FA70F77303045F0"/>
what they have done;</HI> and of the condition of some being far <HI>more tolerable</HI> than that of o∣thers.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE I</HEAD>
<P>For Information in two particulars;</P>
<P N="1">1. That a place in the visible Church is a dangerous station. It is inded a great privi∣ledge; they that are here are nearer to Sal∣vation than others: but if they are under such a curious observation, and such an exact ac∣count be taken of all their rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and re∣turns, needs must their hazards be very great. Is all charged upon them, and are their De∣portments under it set down to their score? doth God write down every thing? it will then be a large scrowl that all such will have to be called to an account for: and O that bareless sinners would think much of this; it might serve greatly to put the aw of God upon their hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence see the great folly and danger of all such as boast of their priviledges, and re∣gard not the improvement of them. How many are there who talk high of what they enjoy? they are placed in Gods House, they are favoured with all the benefits of the <HI>G</HI>os∣pel: but in the mean while, they are regard∣less to themselves, and to their lives; they
<PB N="125" REF="000581_0130_0FA70F7AD243B090"/>
take no heed to themselves how they live un∣der these liberties; and yet they value them∣selves according to these things: and what multitudes are there who have found that this kind of computation hath proved their undoing? these must needs run a fearful risk and will be sadly disappointed, when after they have boasted and bragged of their great enjoyments, they shall be summoned to an∣swer for all, and a fearful scrowl shall be drawn up against them, of their horrible ne∣glect, contempt and unprofitableness under all? when they shall sadly be convinced, that it had been better for them to have grown in any other Soyl in the world, then to have had a place in the Vineyard?</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE II.</HEAD>
<P>Let every such one be exhorted to keep a strict account of these things. If God doth thus, it then loudly calls upon us to do so too; and to move us hereto, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. The neglect of this duty is one great reason of the barrenness of professors. A careless frame of spirit; a neither <HI>regard∣ing the operations of the Lord,</HI> nor observing the framings of their own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>souls; this makes multitudes to live as if they had neither duty
<PB N="126" REF="000581_0131_0FA70F7C001919C8"/>
nor danger before them: and how often have we <HI>G</HI>od complaining of his people that they would not consider, mentioning it as the lea∣ding cause of all the other things which he had to Article against them for? this not <HI>laying of things to heart</HI> made them secure and regardless, of themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. This reckoning, if any thing, will quicken you to present duty. I am sure that it carries matter of awful awakening in it, and helps to convince us how much we are concerned to see that our matters be good; to think that we have to do with a God, who is so strict in observing and recor∣ding, and is consequently like to be so ex∣action reckoning, with us. <HI>Paul</HI> thought it to be an argument of strong perswasion, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is the way to know you pre∣sent state. We are all dobtors to God for all that he is thus doing for us; and accor∣ding to our Improvement of these things, so the account stands between him and us; in this way then we come, to a reckoning with God. We know what we are indebted to him, by reflecting upon all that he hath been doing for us; but we know upon what ground we stand with him, by a right computing what fruit there is of all this in us.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thus also we shall come to know how it is
<PB N="127" REF="000581_0132_0FA70F7DCA84A850"/>
like to go with us in the day of Judge∣ment. Then it will be strictly e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quired both what we recieved, and how we impro∣ved: then the faithful servant shall have his <HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge</HI> well done: and then the unprofitable servant shall recieve his Condemnation, and surely it is good for us to know before hand if we may, whether we are like to stand or fall in the Judgment, and for our Di∣rection in this Affair, let us take these Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be frequent and distinct in observing all the ways in which <HI>G</HI>od comes to you. There hath been a summary account of this given in the explication of the Doctrine: and if <HI>G</HI>od distinctly observes them, do you do so too; and that both outwardly and inwardly: and be very particular: remember this Sab∣bath, that Lecture, this mercy, that afflection, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> what was spoken in your hearing, and what there was whispered in your hearts: and reckon, not only the seasons that you did enjoy; but what you might have enjoyed if you had not willingly, at least negligent∣ly omitted; for God certainly doth so; and you must expect to hear of it again.</P>
<P N="2">2. Examine you selves particulatly what use you have made of these things. Set down the improvement over-against the en∣joyment: this is the way to have the ac∣counts clear. Say to your own Souls, God
<PB N="128" REF="000581_0133_0FA70F7E4D6AF790"/>
came to me at such a time in his Word, and spake thus, what impression did it make on my heart and life: he came in such a mercy, what did I render to him for it? he spake to me by such an affliction, how did I resent it? what is my profiting by all these things? and that your account may be full, enquire after your carriage both in the time, and af∣terwards: what impression did it leave on your hearts? did you entertain God speak∣ing to you, or did you reject him? and how did it in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence your after-conversation: did you soon forget it, or hath it made you to be more careful and critical in your steps?</P>
<P N="3">3. Draw particular Conciusions from hence: and more especially these two.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the Conviction of barrenness quicken you to repentance, and diligence. How many, if they would draw up the ac∣counts faithfully, will find that they have ill requited God, and never born any fruit? and who is there but may sadly say, I have not come up as I ought, to an answera∣bleness to what God hath been doing for me? and what doth this call for, but that we go to God and bewail it, repent of it, and seek to have the accounts adjusted by Christ our Surety? and to ask of him grace that we may be up and doing, and redeem the time that remains, in better diligence, serving him more and better.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="129" REF="000581_0134_0FA70F7EBAA41D90"/>
2. <HI>Let it mightily encourage us to renewed indu∣stry in bearing fruit, to think that God keeps such an account. As the consideration of this so∣lemn truth should make us both fearful and care∣ful in our work, because be puts it on record what he hath done for us, so to remember that he also enters down all that we do in our whole life, should make us not only af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aid of mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> im∣provement, but also chearful in a constant vigo∣rous improvement, as knowing that, if it be so,</HI> our Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</P>

<ITEM>3. Wherein this appears to be so great an aggravation of their Guilt?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. When men may be said to be barren after all?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It hath been already expressed under a former Doctrine, what are the Characters of a fruitless tree in the Vineyard. All I shall here add is only to observe, that there is a two-fold barrenness that may be taken notice of in professors that sit under the means of Grace, and have long enjoyed <HI>G</HI>ods patient strivings with them, <ABBR>VIZ;</ABBR> total and par∣tial.</P>
<P N="1">1. Total barrenness is when men, after all, remain in their natural state, unconver∣ted to God. Every Child of <HI>Adam,</HI> in his unconverted state, is barren: he is utterly uncapable of bringing forth any fruit that is acceptable to <HI>G</HI>od; he is a briar and thorn, and cannot bear figs. The sinner, before conversion, hath no saving principle in him, and therefore he <HI>cannot serve</HI> G<HI>od;</HI> his best moral actions are but glitering abominations: as long therefore as he abides thus, and doth not truly turn to God, he is the same man that he was born: whatsoever men obtain by means, though they get a great deal of literal, knowledge in the things of God, and obtain so much of a civil and moral conver∣sation, as the young man in, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. yet if▪
<PB N="132" REF="000581_0137_0FA70F80F39FE588"/>
he be not savingly changed, if he be not throughly turned to <HI>G</HI>od, he is an <HI>empty vine,</HI> his works are <HI>dead works,</HI> he is still <HI>dead in trespasses</HI> and sins. Nature under all its moral refinings, is but nature still; grace is another manner of thing, and he is a stranger to it; he is yet <HI>in the gall of bitter∣ness and bond of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Partial barrenness is when Professors do not bring forth fruit answerable to their tilling. When Christians have a new princi∣ple of grace in them, and do bear real fruit, but it is little they bring forth, nothing in comparison with the cost and Pains that is laid out upon them: and good scarce de∣serves to be called so, in them from whom far better is expected. <HI>G</HI>od doth not afford to all his people alike advantages; and a tree may be counted fruitful for one Soil that may be reputed unfruitful in another: and it is apparent, that some Christians that enjoy the same helps, that grow in the same Vineyard, do abundantly less for God than others do; now these may be said in a degree to be bar∣ren: and although the Doctrine more espe∣cially arms at the former, yet these also come under the consideration of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whence it is that they are so? <HI>i. e.</HI> that they abide unfruitful after all endeavours patiently used with them.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There are these things here to be ob∣served:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="133" REF="000581_0138_0FA70F81B0BB4FB0"/>
1. In respect of total barrenness?</P>
<P N="1">1. That mans natural barrenness cleaves to him so close, that no creature can remove it. They cannot bear, except they be chan∣ged, and there is no power in themselves, nor in any man or Angel to do it for them. It is a work of Divine Power to make any soul spiritually fruitful: the stock, and root and branches are dead; and as a dead tree cannot bear, so art cannot put life into it, a Miracle only can, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 13.</P>
<P N="2">2. That hence the means, though proper as means, yet have their efficacy absoultely depending on him who hath made them means. Every man cannot wield <HI>Goliab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Sword. The <HI>word</HI> indeed is compared to a <HI>two-edged Sword,</HI> but none can make it to cut by the Spirit: An Instrument is then ser∣viceable, when one that is able and skillful applies it; the Word then converts, when the Spirit makes it a converting word. If God <HI>touch Lyd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a's heart,</HI> whilst <HI>Paul</HI> is Prea∣ching; she shall yield to the call: if he puts quickning efficacy into it, men shall be quick∣ned by it, else they remain <HI>dead in trespasses and sins,</HI> for all the endeavours of moral In∣struments.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is a natural resistance in the hearts of men, to all the endeavours which are used with them in the means. The con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enerate corruption which men lying with
<PB N="134" REF="000581_0139_0FA70F8298A4FD90"/>
them into the world, hath in it a strong <HI>in mity</HI> against all which is good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and by vertue of this they set themselves to <HI>resist the Spirit of God,</HI> and so withstand all the calls and counsels that are given them, <HI>despising the goodness and forbearance of God, and turning the Gospel grace into wantonness:</HI> and thus will all men do as long as they are left to themselves, by reason of the wicked∣ness that is in their hearts.</P>
<P N="4">4. That God doth often judicially leave men to their own choice. <HI>He gives them up to their hearts lusts,</HI> they resist his grace, and he calls, and convinceth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and waits, but they will not near him, and thereupon he suffers them to take their course, because they will not receive instruction: and it is righteous with him so to do, because they in this re∣sistance, shut their eyes against rational con∣viction, and are wilful against the clearest light; and whilst it is so, let him wait never so long, and come never so often, they will be never the better, but abide barren still.</P>
<P N="2">2. In respect of partial barrenness.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a root of corruption, tending to unfruitfulness, in <HI>G</HI>ods children in this life, <HI>Paul</HI> hath his <HI>body of death</HI> which pesters him; and what is the tendency of Death but barrenness? <HI>a dead womb</HI> is a barren womb; a dead heart, a barren heart. The acts of grace are life acts, death therefore is direct∣ly
<PB N="135" REF="000581_0140_0FA70F860DE4AFB8"/>
contrary to them, and this was the things which made <HI>Paul</HI> so unable <HI>to do the things that he would.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There are a great many Temptations that the Children of God do meet with to hinder them in their constant serving of God. The World we live in, is a place of Tempta∣tion, and every thing is full of it: and the tendency of it is to abure or discourage the Christian from his work. There are the Temptations of carnal pleasures, of worldly encumbrances, of difficulties and threatning dangers in Duty. Riches have their shares, and so hath poverty: peace hath its allure-ments, and persecution it's affright∣ments.</P>
<P N="3">3. The corrupt part that is in us, often takes advantage by these Temptations to obstruct the Christian in his business. It is by these things that <HI>the Law in his Members brings him into Capativity?</HI> and if the Spirit of God leaves him to himself to try what is in him, it is always so: he either dallies with allurements, and diverts unhappily to these things, and spends his time with them; or he stops at discouragements, and sits still dis∣heartned; and by these means he neglects the work of God, which causeth the fruits of Holiness to grow very thin upon him, as the grapes on the vines after the Vintage, <HI>Micah.</HI> 7. 2.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="136" REF="000581_0141_0FA70F87CBA4B680"/>
3. Wherein this appears to be so great an aggravation of their <HI>G</HI>uilt?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This will be seen by laying those things together.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is the duty of sinners to hearken to the voice of God. Whatever pleas men may pretendedly make of their own impo∣tency, it gives them no discharge from the obligation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Duty which is lying upon them. God is the rightful Lord and Law∣giver; and his commands have an Obedi∣ence due to them from the creature, who cannot with hold it without the guilt of re∣bellion. Besides, the Gospel takes off all excuse here; because it looks upon men as being without strength in themselves, and hath accordingly provided and offered all help to them in <HI>Christ,</HI> whose spirit is ready and able to do all that is wanting. Now it is certain that God requires fruit of all that enjoy the means: he <HI>looks</HI> for it, <HI>Text.</HI> It is <HI>his will</HI> that they bear it, 1 <HI>Thes▪</HI> 4. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That this Patience of God gives men a great deal of opportunity to bring forth fruit, if they had an heart to it. This life is a time of serving God in; that which follows is the time of reward: the longer therefore men live in Gods Vineyard, the greater season they have of doing him service: every day that they are there continued, puts a new</HI> price into their hands, <HI>which, when once Gods patience is at an end,
<PB N="137" REF="000581_0142_0FA70F8962A13FE8"/>
men must never more expect to enjoy: and hence the more of it is now allowed them, which they improve not, the more opportunity is lost: it gives them</HI> space <HI>to bethink themselves, to reflect upon their Ways and courses, to recover their lost time, and to</HI> redeem their season, <HI>by a better and more diligent improvement of it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The means afforded them are very pro∣per as means, to the end of fruitfulness. Means indeed are to be looked at in their proper place, and acknowledged as so; and in this respect there is nothing wanting to them, which is proper and suitable in this affair. Our fruit is <HI>a reasonable service, Ro.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. 1. the means which God comes to us in, are very well accommodated to such a ser∣vice, for its help, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16, 17. They serve to inform the understanding in the Do∣ctrines of Salvation, and tell men wherein <HI>G</HI>od is to be served; what is the fruit that he expects and will accept; where strength i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be had, and how to be improved; to e∣stablish the Judgment in the excellency of Obedience, and great benefits of serving God; to convince the Conscience of all sin and disobedience: to territy sinners from their sinful unprofitableness; to encou∣rage holiness, by all the precious pro∣mises which are made to all such as bear fruit: and what more can be desired in means.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="138" REF="000581_0143_0FA70F89F3A6DEB0"/>
4. Hence this patience, and these pains which God useth are leading to Repentance. If the <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Forbearance</HI> of God exer∣cised towards heathen are so, <HI>Rom,</HI> 2. 3. How much more are these <HI>G</HI>ospel endeavours so, which he lays out upon men that are under the dispensations of it? They lead by way of Conviction shewing men what reason there is why they should so do; and they lead also by way of Invitation: there is an Invita∣tion in the things themselves, patience saith that God is not willing these sinners should perish, else he needed not to have waited no them, who every day gave him provocation; and that hath a loud call in it. Every time <HI>G</HI>od, comes in an Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance or Providence, he doth therein bespeak men: and to be sure all the secret approaches of the spirit of God to their hearts in and by these, have a close call in them.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence the more men have of these, and continue unfruitful under them, the more is God despised, and his favours abused. Bar∣tenness under Gods patience &amp; pleading with men, addes contempt to unprofitableness, and by this means all the expense that is laid out upon them comes to be lost, as to their benefit, &amp; they do what in them lies to frus∣strate God of his just expectation. For a tree in the <HI>W</HI>ilderness to bear nothing is not so much, but when it is transplanted into the
<PB N="139" REF="000581_0144_0FA70F8AB2B56E18"/>

<P N="6">6. Hereby unregenerate sinners the more discover their impen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> &amp; desperate hardness of heart: yea indeed, they are made the more obstinate and lard-hearted. Unpro∣fitableness under the means that <HI>G</HI>od useth with men in his house, makes them more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooted in sin, and they that are not conver∣ted by them, are set farther off from it, and that not only judicially, but naturally too; for sin gets h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad and ripens no where faster, then under the Gospel, which, where it is not <HI>a favour of life,</HI> will be a <HI>favour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h i. e.</HI> it will leave men more dead, more un∣believing; set them farther off from <HI>G</HI>od, and under a greater Moral Difficultie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Conversion; and this also is an aggrava∣sion.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hereby Believers discover the strength of their <HI>natural corruption, and do also carry it</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>worthy of their vocation. <HI>It is unbecoming
<PB N="140" REF="000581_0145_0FA70F8B6F6AFA20"/>

<P>Let it be a loud call to old sinners that are under the Gospel. Are there none among us, that have not been three, but thirty, for∣ty, fifty years in the Vineyard, under the means of grace, and strivings of the spirit of God, and have not to this day brought forth and fruit that God will accept of, but have lived in their natural state, neglected their Souls, and not regarded to improve the Op∣portunities they have had? Let this Doctrine awaken you, and put you upon making haste to get your sin pardoned, your guilt remov∣ed, and your souls made fertile; and to move you thereto, let me offer these con∣siderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Think how much Guilt you have al∣ready contracted to yourselves. Know it, whatever pretence of respect you have shewn to the Gospel and the means of <HI>G</HI>race, yet your barrenness is a witness against you that you have indeed neglected and despised all: count up how many Sabbaths you have lived▪ and remember so many days have been profaned by you; and so many Sermons as you have heard, so many witnesses you

<P N="2">2. Remember what an Holy God you have to do with, Never delude your selves with a vain confidence in abused mercy, God knows how to cloth himself with Vengeance. and kindle up his fury <HI>into a fire unquenchea∣ble,</HI> if you dare to go on to itritate it by your impenitence.

<P N="2">2. You are also yourselves great losers by it The more fruit that you bear, the more Glory you shall have.

<P N="1">1. Be much in mortifying the lusts that are in you.

<P N="1">1. The word of command given out for its excision; <HI>Cut it down.</HI> The word, in its usage is almost appropriate to Husbandmen or Gardners; and it signifieth more than a meet cutting down, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an <HI>Extirpation.</HI> When
<PB N="147" REF="000581_0152_0FA70F954EAB3FC0"/>
trees are dead or barren, they used to cut them up by the roots; and make fuel of them for the fire, that so room might be made for the planting of others in their place: and it here Allegorically designs the utter ruine and destruction of the barren professor. On∣ly here a difficulty ariseth which must be ob∣viated, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> How comes the Vine-dresser to be commanded to do it? especially upon the former interpretation given, which told us that he represented the Gospel Ministry; the ministers work being to aim at the conversion and salvation, and not the destruction of those whom he is sent unto: for which reason some interpret <HI>G</HI>od himself, others, Christ to be here intended, who <HI>hath the Keys of Heaven and Hell,</HI> the power of life and death. It might be sufficient here to answer, that simi∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tudes do not run on all four, and therefore Parables are not to be over-strained: and it might suffice to say, it intends that God will not always bear with unprofitable unregene∣rate sinners, that live under the Gospel, and that he gives his Servants notice of it. Men are wont to cut up trees in their Gardens by the hands of their Servants, who look after them; God will do this to these with his own hand, only he would have his Ministers to give them faithful notice of it. But I supose there is something more in it then so: Let us then here observe, that there is a twofold

cutting off of sinners according to Scripture; the one is <HI>Ministerial,</HI> the other <HI>Providen∣tial.</HI></P>
<P>This latter is Gods prerogative, and he doth it by those Judgments which he brings upon them, in which also he often uses the Instrumentality of second causes. Some∣times he doth it by war, sometimes by pesti∣lential diseases, sometimes by the hand of ci∣vil justice to which he suffers them to expose themselves; and he hath many ways to ac∣complish it by; but in this the Gospel Mini∣stry is not concerned. The former of these belongs properly to them, as they are the Ambassadors of God, sent to treat with men about the affairs of the Kingdom, who, if men will not accept of the terms of the trea∣ty, and comply with the Articles offered them, are, after all means used to bring them to it unsuccessfully, to proclaim war a∣gainst them. They are first to call and counsel, and plead with sinners, and if that will not do, then are they to warn them, and if they accept not of that, their business then is to threaten them, and tell them what they are to expect; and this the Spi∣rit of God, calls <HI>killing of them, Hos.</HI> 6. 5. and in this sense must <HI>Jeremiah'</HI>s Commission be interpreted, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1. 10.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE I. <HI>That God will not always bear with fruitless pro∣fessors in his Visible Church.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This Doctrine ariseth from the connexion of the edict here given out, with the com∣plaint made in the former part of the verse. It is q.d. <HI>I</HI> have been thus long waiting to no purpose, and <HI>I</HI> can bear no longer.

<P N="1">1. For the evidence of the Doctrine, or that it is so: and here we need to look no farther than the Scripture warnings, threat∣nings, and examples which do abundantly il∣lustrate it.

<P N="2">2. For the ground of it, or the reason why it is so, we may gather it up in these conclusions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="152" REF="000581_0157_0FA70F9E17535040"/>
1. That though Gods Patience be himself, and therefore Infinite, yet it is exercised ac∣cording to his Wisdom and pleasure. Attri∣butes considered as in God, are God, for he is one individed Essence, and pure act, and therefore every vertue which we ascribe to <HI>G</HI>od, must be acknowledged to be Infinite in him: but yet as they are made to shine out in his works of Efficiency, we are to account them voluntary, and managed according to the Wisdom of God: he therefore measures them out to the Creature more or less, accor∣ding to his own discretion. For men there∣fore to argue from the Divine Nature of <HI>G</HI>ods love, mercy, forbearance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to please themselves with an opinion that he must be boundless in his expressions of them to the creature, is a vain fancy, and▪ that which <HI>G</HI>od warns men against, lest they should so cheat themselves into ruine, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27. 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God must and will be glorified in all those Attributes of his which he displays to the children of men. God doth all things for himself; his own glory is his own last end in all his works of Efficiency, and there∣fore he manageth the whole discovery of them, with an eye fixed on this end: he had been glorious in himself, if he had never ma∣nifested any of his Perfections to the crea∣ture; but if he do thus make himself known, he will bring about his declarative glory by
<PB N="153" REF="000581_0158_0FA70F9E35425E70"/>
it: it is that which is dear to him, and he will not part with it. If therefore he be patient with sinners, and wait upon them when he might destroy them; if he deferr his revenge, and suppress his anger, he will have the honour of this, he will get to him∣self a name by <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That for which God waits upon sinners un∣der the Gospel is to see if they will bear fruit. That which is the end of a tree's planting, is that which a man expects of it, and for that it is he lets it grow, and waits from year to year to see if it answers the end,</HI> Text. <HI>Men are planted in Gods Vineyard on purpose for fruit; there are none standing there of whom it is not expected. Now the Husbandman knows that time must be allowed to trees planted, for their fructifying; and he is wont to think, that though such a tree doth not this year answer his expecta∣tion, but goes over, and bears nothing; yet it is possible it may make amends for it the next year▪ and if then it also misseth, yet if it doth but blossom, and bid fair for it, though all fall off and dy away, he is willing to try one season more, as being loth to cut it down if it may be prevent∣ed: but still all his patience is, because he sup∣poseth it may at last bear: Thus God expresseth his waiting upon sinners to be upon such a pre∣sumption,</HI> Zeph. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That all the while that any remain unfruit∣ful in Gods Vineyard, they cast contempt on
<PB N="154" REF="000581_0159_0FA70F9EF8361B30"/>
Gods Patience.</HI> For this reason impenitent sinners are said to <HI>despise it,</HI> Rom. 2. 3. <HI>G</HI>od looks upon himself to be scorned, and his le∣nity to be trampled on by such persons; for hereby they do withstand and directly set themselves against the very design of the <HI>G</HI>ospel, they do, as to the present efficacy, make void all the pains and endeavours that are laid out upon them; they <HI>turn the grace of God into wantonness: G</HI>od waits for their repentance, and they answer it with obstina∣cy, and impenitence, which is directly con∣trary: and when is mercy despised, but when it is abused? and what greater abuse can be offered to it than this?</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence <HI>G</HI>od is hereby greatly dishonour∣ed, and therefore must needs be very highly provoked. For Sinners to offer an affront to any of Gods Attributes, is a reflection of di∣shonour upon him. Men count themselves disparaged when they lose their labour; and Gods Honour is trodden upon by Sinners when they abide unprofitable in his vineyard, If then he be bound for his glory in all, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Jealous for his great Name,</HI> it must be an high provocation that is thus offered to him; and we must not think that he cannot resent it; no, he declares that his holy Spi∣rit is <HI>grieved</HI> by such things, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 40. and <HI>they vex him, Isa.</HI> 63. 10. and therefore God himself is brought in making that complaint,
<PB N="155" REF="000581_0160_0FA70F9FB24629B8"/>
<HI>Amos</HI> 2. 13. <HI>I am pressed under you as a Cart that is pressed with sheaves.</HI> God speaks as a man, who though he bears, and is patient, as to any discovery of himself, yet is inward∣ly weary, and finds a burden which he would willingly be eased of: intimating that he is displeased at such things; and he is wont to express this di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pleasure of his, partly in the solemn warnings of his Ordinances, partly in the rebukes of his Providence, which he lays upon such, in sore and heavy affliction; to signify, that though for the present he bears with them, yet he is dissatisfied at them.</P>
<P N="6">6. That impenitent sinners grow worse and worse under the Patience of God, and so add to the provocation. The means of grace under which men are continued during the long-suffering of God, are either a <HI>sa∣vour of life,</HI> or of <HI>death.</HI> Now impenitency or unprofitableness makes them to be a fa∣vour of death, and that is by hardening them in sin; and therefore we find that <HI>evil∣men</HI> are said to <HI>grow worse,</HI> and this is a natu∣ral effect in such; for their hearts being naught, they misimprove all the means to nourish their corruption, and so grow more obstinate, which operation being directly con∣trary to what the <HI>G</HI>ospel calls for, which is that they should grow better by it, must needs lay in the more anger of God against them, and therefore the longer they thus a∣bide,
<PB N="156" REF="000581_0161_0FA70FA08834AD70"/>
the more must his jealousie be enflamed against them.</P>
<P N="7">7. Men at length grow hopeless, and then Patience is bootless. For if the proper end of <HI>G</HI> ods patience be to wait for fruit of them, to see if it will not at last repent them of their barrenness; if they will not think <HI>of their ways, and turn their feet unto Gods Commandments;</HI> then the design of it is at an end, when all expectation of this is over: as long as the Owner supposeth that his tree may in time become serviceable, there is some reason for his letting it stand in the Vineyard, but when all grounds of so look∣ing for it fail, and he utterly despairs of a∣ny such thing, what should he let it stand for any longer? That there is such a state which sinners do in time arrive at, we are told, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36. 16. not that any are gone so far as to out-do Almighty power, but so as to despise all manner of means, and grow obstinate and remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sless, so as that all endea∣vours do appear to be utterly in vain, when they show their determinate resolution and wilfulness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 11, 12. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 5.</P>
<P N="8">8. Hence God is now put upon it to reco∣ver his own glory of them, by bearing no longer. He hath now, to speak after the manner of men, for born as long as he can: he hath waited to have glory from them by their serving of him, and given them a gra∣cious

As a Creditor that betrusts his Debtor from time to time, and is frequently asking his ho∣nest payment, but none comes; he still cre∣dits them, but hath nothing but words and promises, no performances; at length he fees it bootless to wait any longer, and now he sues him for it, and recovers it in a way of Justice; and there is all reason for it, unless he would lose all; but this God will never do, and why indeed should he?</P>

There are indeed</HI> great and precious pro∣mises <HI>held out to all those that are in the Cove∣nant; but they are also under severe menace; and by vertue of their station in the visible Church, they are equally related to the one as to the other. Do not forget that the Gospel Covenant hath its conditions, and accordingly as men are under them, so it speaks to them comfort or terrour. It saith,</HI> if you believe you shall be saved, <HI>but it saith too,</HI> if you believe not, you shall be damned; <HI>it saith, if you bear fruit you shall be commended, but it also assures you, that if you bear none you shall be condemned: yea, as it hath</HI> better promises, <HI>so it hath more severe threat∣nings than the first Covenant had. Think it not to be enough to say, I am in the Covenant, and so to run away with a carnal confidence, that all is well: But put your selves upon a thorough search, and enquire what part of the Covenant you stand under; there is a vast difference be∣tween being under the Covenant-promise, and threatning; nothing is more comfortable than the former, nothing more amazing than the lat∣ter: and know it, that if you abide barren still, this is your condition, and you may well expect to have the threatning accomplished upon you.</HI></P>

an end that you are aware of. This deserves to be well thought of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, to give some weight to this argument, be advised to consider.</P>
<P N="1">1. In generall, that God frequently falls upon such sinners, when they least expect it. Not but that they have reason and suf∣ficient grounds for this expectation; if they would entertain them; for indeed their ve∣ry barrenness is enough to excite it in them: but when they, through carnal confidence and vain security; indulge themselves in the ex∣pectance of many more days of tranquility, shut their eyes against convictions, and so live without fear of evil; then God breaks in upon them, and makes them to feel the impressions of his indignation; when they say, <HI>To morrow shall be as this day; and much more abundant,</HI> when they despise warnings, and trample upon threatnings, and say, the <HI>Vision is for many days to come.</HI> Thus our Sa∣viour declares that it shall be done to the <HI>un∣faithful</HI> S<HI>teward, Mat.</HI> 24. 50 51. this <HI>Paul</HI> tells us shall be the lot of such as neglect a day of grace, 1. <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly take these two Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. That you may be under all the means of Grace, and strivings of the Spirit and yet <HI>G</HI>ods patience be near worn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut. The Hus∣bandman, as long as the fig-tree is in the Vineyard; and he is waiting for fruit of in,
<PB N="162" REF="000581_0167_0FA70FA97870D270"/>
neglects not the husbandry of it, but gives it the tendance that is proper, and he is wont to do so, till he resolves with himself that there will no good come of it, and so to remove it away. Thus God doth by men in the visible Church; let them be never so sinful and vain, yet they shall have the Ordinances, and possibly many convictions of the Spirit, awa∣kenings and terrors, which are a witness that Gods day of Patience is not at an end with them; but it doth not say but that they may speedily be cut off: <HI>the man without the</HI> W<HI>edding Garment</HI> is taken from the Table: this therefore is no plea sufficient to build your confidence upon.</P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>G</HI>od frequently withdraws his Spirit from the means, as the first effect of his departure from unfruitful sinners. He possibly neither takes the means from them, nor them from the means for the present; but he secretly withdraws from them, and leaves them only under outward dispensati∣ons, without any inward impressions upon their hearts; he <HI>makes their hearts fat,</HI> and leaveth senceleness and remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness u∣pon them: the Spirit of God departs from them, and then the means ripen them the faster, and make them the more stupid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottish; and the going away of the <HI>S</HI>pirit it an awful desertion, and, though not regarded
<PB N="163" REF="000581_0168_0FA70FAA336011B0"/>
by sinners, yet greatly discovers the wrath of God against them <HI>Hos.</HI> 9, 12.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be perswaded to think whether <HI>G</HI>ods Jealousie be not kindled against this people. Are there not many awful tokens of his An∣ger, and such as speak so much to us, that he is almost weary with forbearing? Look where we will, and observe the frame of things, the state of affairs at home, abroad, in publick, in private concerns, and they all witness that God hath a controversy with us, and that it is begun: and how many are taken by it? and now let us ask, why is all this? <HI>what means the heat of this anger?</HI> is it not for the barrenness of Gods people? is it not because he hath been <HI>coming to sick fruit▪ and finds it not?</HI> I am sure every unprofitable soul hath reason to think of it, and that with trembling too, and to say, will not this Judgment find me out? and suppose it should sieze me in particular, will it not be a righteous Judg∣ment upon me? when God is bringing of his Judgments upon his visible people, they that <HI>forget</HI> God, had need to <HI>consider</HI> with them∣selves.</P>
<P N="5">5. Think how woful your condition will be, when God hath done waiting, and you prove unfruitful: <HI>G</HI>ods day of patience, is your day of grace; when that ends, this ends; and when that is done it will be an e∣vil case that you will be found in. When
<PB N="164" REF="000581_0169_0FA70FAB209143D8"/>
<HI>G</HI>od saith, <HI>I am weary with forbearing, let Sinners in Zion be afraid,</HI> and look to them∣selves: it is for your sakes that he is angry, and therefore you will stand just in the way of his indignation: and how terrible a thing it will be, to be made the monuments of it, when with the day of forbearance, all hopes will cease, and the wrath of God will make a way for it self to fall upon you, will be evident by the next Doctrine, let Sinners then entertain the consideration of this truth with fear and trembling.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE II. <HI>A Fearful Destruction waits upon such as have wearied out Gods patience by their barrenness.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HEre is the sentence which the Owner pronounceth on the fig-tree, upon his complaint; <HI>Cut it down:</HI> stub it up, root it out, let it no longer have any room in the vineyard, but make it fit for the fire. Their danger then is very great, they stand on the very brink of ruine. That Gods patience may he tired out, and is so by multitudes under the <HI>G</HI>ospel, hath been already observ∣ed; and now we see what becomes of such as these they are to be cut down: <HI>G</HI>od faith it, and he doth not speak words but things. That this Doctrine may be made manifest, we may consider.</P>
<P N="1">1. What is contained or implied in this cutting down?</P>
<P N="2">2. Why it must come to this when Gods patience is wearied?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="166" REF="000581_0171_0FA70FB038334888"/>
3. Wherein the dreadfulness of this de∣struction may be discovered?</P>
<P N="1">1. What is contained or implied in this cutting down.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Metaphor here used, sutably re∣presents those Judgments of <HI>G</HI>od which fall upon unprofitable ones, in the progress of them; we may therefore take up the allusion in several particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Cutting down a fig-tree in the vineyard argues the Owners great displeasure at it. It saith that he can bear it no longer there: as long as he afforded it dressing, it shewed that he had a favour for it; but this action Proves that now he hath none. Cutting down a timber tree may be with approabati∣on, to put it into the building which he judg∣eth it meet for; but cutting down a fruit-tree is from disapprobation, because he sees it unworthy of his care. Hereby therefore is expressed that God is exceeding angry at men; that his pity and compassion is ended, and his wrath is kindled. God hath no pas∣sions in him, properly essential to him, but we ascribe them to him with respect to his Providence. The Scripture therefore signi∣fies such things to be the fruits of his indigna∣tion, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4 4. <HI>Lev.</HI> 26. 28. <HI>Job.</HI> 20. 28. Godly men are taken away by death, but it is to make pillars of them in the Celestial Temple; to transplant them into the Hea∣venly
<PB N="167" REF="000581_0172_0FA70FB1D98971F0"/>
Paradise; but these are cut down to shew that God hates them. And</P>
<P N="2">2. Cutting down is Properly for destruct∣ion. This is the true import of the word here: it is not a promise, but a threatning, when a tree is cut down and rooted up, it is by that very act destroyed; it kills it, it pre∣sently dies upon it, it withers up, the sap <HI>&amp;</HI> leaves are presently gone, there is henceforth no more possibility that it should bear any fruit; it puts an end to all hopes of any such thing. Christ therefore intends that God will destroy the sinner; he before seemed to have some sap in him, and bear the leaves of a fair profession, it may be: but new as the <HI>Fig-tree Cursed</HI> by Christ, <HI>he withers up to the very roots▪</HI> The Apostle speaks of some in the Visible Church, <HI>whose end is destruction, Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> 3. 19. A Tree may be moved for its better growing, but it is cut down to put it beyond hopes of any such thing.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the Owner cuts down the tree, he now puts an end to all his husbandry a∣bout the Tillage of it. Tillage and extirpa∣tion are contraries▪ he may prune it, and cut off many exuberant branches from it, for its advantage, that it may bring forth more fruit and grow the better; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cuts it down, this is no part of Husbandry to the tree, but a putting of an end to it. It t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfore signifies, that God will no more do any thing
<PB N="168" REF="000581_0173_0FA70FB274719D08"/>
for such a person: he shall have no more of∣fers of Grace, no more strivings of his Spirit, no more dews of Ordinances; he puts an end▪ to all warnings, counsels, perswasions, entrea∣ties: <HI>He saith to the Clouds that they rain no more upon him, Isa.</HI> 5. 6. it puts a full pe∣riod to his day of grace, withdraws from him all the means of good. There is a vast difference between afflicting his professing people, and cutting them down; a man may be afflicted for his good, but if he be cut down, it is for his hurt.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is an instrument used by the Husbandman, for the cutting down of the tree withal. This is fitted and prepared for the purpose. Men use an ax in this service, and they are wont to sharpen it that it may do it effectually. Thus we read, <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 9. <HI>The ax is laid to the root of the tree.</HI> This is the ax of Divine Vengeance, and God is usu∣ally pleased to do this by the instrumentality of second causes, fitted by him for the pur∣pose: these are for this reason called his In∣struments in Scripture; his <HI>Ax▪</HI> his <HI>Saw,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Sword:</HI> He sometimes indeed makes them only rods, and then indeed it is for a∣mendment; but at other times they are Swords, Instruments of Excision, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 21. 9, 10, 11. sometimes <HI>G</HI>od sends a Sickness, and that is Commissioned to take away his life, and it doth it, and no means can save
<PB N="169" REF="000581_0174_0FA70FB32EF48DB8"/>
him alive; it chops him down, and there is an end of him here: sometimes he delivers him up into the hands of an Enemy, and he slays him without pity: these do it but in∣strumentally; they are <HI>G</HI>ods Tools, and it is he who makes use of them for this pur∣pose.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are usually divers stroaks given for the cutting a tree down, it is not ordi∣narily done at once, but several blows; it is a successive action; every stroak doth some∣thing toward it, but the thing is accomplish∣ed by degrees, it falls not till the last be gi∣ven: and thus God often proceeds gradually to the destruction of such sinners; he first <HI>kills them by Prophets,</HI> and afterwards by his own hand; he first smites them with spiritu∣al plagues, and after that with temporal judgments. It is true, God sometimes to shew his power and the strength of his hand, useth a sharp ax, and strikes a fearful blow, by which he cuts them down at once, but for the most part he doth it by divers Judgments successive; and it is to be observed that eve∣ry thing which God doth to them, after once he hath clapt the curse and seal of his wrath upon them, is a stroak given towards their cutting down, a step directly to their ruine <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 20.</P>
<P N="6">6. Cutting down is in order to casting out. When the Husbandman is come to
<PB N="170" REF="000581_0175_0FA70FB4114F6198"/>
this work, it saith that he is resolved this tree shall stand here no longer; and there∣fore as soon as that is done he presently throws it out of the vineyard; it is there to continue no longer: if he had intended it a room in his Orchard, he would have let it grow still, for it was because he could not endure to see it there that he thus dealt with it. Thus God, when he comes to bring this Judgment upon unfruitful professors, he removes them by it out of the visible Church, he takes them away from all relation, to, or benefit of the priviledges that hitherto they had enjoyed there. There is an Ordinance of Christ, instituted in his Church, whereby men are cut off from communion with his people, which is a ministerial cutting them down, and is a sigure or token of what God himself will do to such if they repent not, but go on to provoke him.</P>
<P N="7">7. C<HI>utting down is for some other use. When the Owner cuts up his fig-tree, and casts it out of the Vineyard, he doth not throw it away and make no improvement of it; no, though it will not bear figs, yet it will make fires; and so it will not be altogether unprofitable, though it an∣swers not the end of its planting, yet there is an use that he puts it to; he therefore makes it up into faggots, and so burns it as he hath occasion for it; and such is the improvement which God makes of such as did not serve and glorifie him
<PB N="171" REF="000581_0176_0FA70FB707A39CB8"/>
in his Church; he cuts them down, he destroys them; but still he makes use of them; though they are not fit to be</HI> vessels of honour, <HI>yet he makes them</HI> vessels of dishonour, <HI>and that also turns to his honour and glory. There is an hell which</HI> G<HI>od hath prepared for the exalting of the glory of his revenging Justice in; and there are the monuments on whom this glory is exalted, and in whom it is manifested eternally: now such as being fruitless in the vineyard, provoke God to cut them down, are thus disposed of by him, and he is so glorified in them for ever:</HI> he is known in his Judgments which he execut∣eth; <HI>thus are the tares and the chaff, which grow together with the good grain in the field, disposed of, Mat.</HI> 13 30. 3. 12. <HI>thus,</HI> the tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire, <HI>verse</HI> 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. Why it must come to this when Gods patience is wearied?</P>
<P>A. This will be evident by the consideration of these things?</P>
<P N="1">1. These were all of them heirs of destruct∣ion before in their natural state. All those that are planted in Gods Vineyard, were at the first transplanted out of the Wilderness; there was no difference in them from others, but what God was pleased to make by bring∣ing them under the <HI>G</HI>ospel, so the Apostle tells his Ephesians, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 12: yea he as∣sures them that, <HI>They were by nature Children
<PB N="172" REF="000581_0177_0FA70FB7B1CC36F8"/>
of wrath even as others, verse.</HI> 3. All mankind were fallen under condemnation by sin; God in his mercy picks up whom he pleaseth among these, and puts them under the means of Salvation, where he makes the offers, and proposeth the terms of it unto them; but still this is their natural estate, God there∣fore puts his people in mind of what they were, when he first looked upon them, <HI>Ezek,</HI> 16. 3: God for this end appointed a remem∣brance to be solemnly observed by the chil∣dren of Israel, and to be after at the appoint∣ed time openly acknowledged, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Now mens meerly being in the visible Church doth not really alter this state, but only puts them under the advantage for it, and affords to them a mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful treaty, in which God trans∣acts with them about it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence it was only Gods m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er patience which reprieved them from that destruction all this while. There was nothing in them to lay him under the obligation to do it. Men are not in themselves any things the bet∣ter Morally for being in the visible Church; they have the same nature in them, the same evil heart cleaving to them. It alters in∣deed their outward estate, but that in it self doth not change their hearts; nor are they at all changed, as long as they remain bar∣ren, that very thing is an evidence that they are the same men still: It therefore can be
<PB N="173" REF="000581_0178_0FA70FB86F050C60"/>
nothing but patience that keeps ruine from them. It cannot be thought rationally, that God is the less provoked by them, because they are within the pale, whilst they abide unfruitful, than he is with others, or that their sin is less, because they are there, no, but a great deal more: they are a trial to his patience, they live upon it, it is that on∣ly keeps them from perishing.</P>
<P N="3">3. The end of patience being thus alto∣gether frustrate, there now remains nothing else but destruction for them. Why did God bear and wait? it was not for nothing; no, it was to see if they would comply with him, and do him services; if they would repent of their sins, and believe in Christ, and do good works, but they do no such thing, but continue to be obstinate, they out-stand all the essays that are used with them, and dishonour God by so doing, and now they are fit for nothing else the sen∣tence was our before, it was only stopt upon this trial; and after all it avails not; what else is there to be done, but to give i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scope? hence that, <HI>John</HI> 3.18. <HI>he that believes not, is condemned already.</HI> We find therefore that God upon this very ground, enters into a solemn deliberation with these, <HI>Hos</HI> 6. 4. <HI>Oh Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Jer.</HI> 5. 7. <HI>How shall I pardon thee for this?</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="174" REF="000581_0179_0FA70FBC478B59C8"/>
4. And this abuse of his patience must needs heighten the provocation, for now it is reduced to this exigence, that there is no o∣ther course remains to be taken. When up∣on trial made, men prove hopeless; things are brought to that pass, that there is nothing else not be done; and not only so, but all that hath bin thus done for them, would else be wholly lost, and God should have no Glory at all by it there is so much more guilt added as there have been means used, and neglected offers of Grace made and despised: If there∣fore sinners in the World must perish, for their falling short of the <HI>G</HI>lory of God; sinners in the visible Church much more for offering abuse and contempt to these essays that have been used with them, to bring them to Repen∣tance. It is certain that such though they have outward priviledges above them, yet in reali∣ty they are to God esteemed no better than Heanthen, <HI>Amos.</HI> 9: 7: <HI>Are ye not as Children of the Ethiopians to me? Oh Israel! saith the Lord.</HI> Those wild Theevish, Cursed inhabi∣tants of <HI>Arabia</HI> were as good as they: nay these are worse, because they have sinned a∣gainst greater mercies.</P>
<P N="3">3 Wherein the dreadfulness of this destruction may▪ be discovered.</P>
<P>A. That the destruction of all sinners is a fearful thing, must be acknowledged by all such as have any acquaintance with the na∣ture
<PB N="175" REF="000581_0180_0FA70FBDAF5CF060"/>
of the threatning of the Law, and the curse which is contained therein; but the ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of those that have had the priviledge of the Gospel, and a room in the vineyard, and are there cut down, is more peculiarly amazing and terrible, as having some aggra∣vations in it which the other hath not, espe∣cially if we consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath threatned these with more intolerable punishments: and he stands concerned for it in point of honour, that so he may be no loser in the end by any of his Creatures, which he should be, if he should not make such to be more eminent and ob∣servable instances of his displeasure. This therefore is the doom which Christ hath past upon the places where he had bin most conversant, and those with whom he had taken the greatest pains, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11. 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If then they that suffer the easiest hell, suffer beyond our conception, how much more astonishing must the suffering of these be?</P>
<P N="2">2. That those have more to lose than o∣thers. The punishment of loss, is no little part of the misery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of sinners; and indeed that makes way for the Punishment of sense, which is introduced and greatly aggravated by it. The higher men have been lifted up the greater i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their fall, now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>these <HI>have been exalted to Heaven, Math.</HI> 11, 23. The Vine∣yard
<PB N="176" REF="000581_0181_0FA70FBDDA58ACB8"/>
priviledges wee have seen to be many and great, all these are lost at once when the sinner is <HI>cut down.</HI> They were taken near to <HI>G</HI>od, they were under his peculiar favours, they were <HI>not far from the King∣dom,</HI> they had fair and good hopes set before them; and all helps to have brought them to life and salvation; but now they are thrown our of all; they are little things that others lose, in comparison with what these are cut off from.</P>
<P N="3">3. That hence they have more to torment them with the thought of when they are cut down. No little part of the misery of the damned consists in those reflections of Con∣science, which as a never dying worm will be gnawing upon them, and the more will it torment the man. How much then will this mans Conscience have to afflict him with∣all in the place of miseries? there to remem∣ber that he was once near Salvation he had all the opportunities for it, all the tenders of Grace made to him, and the strivings of the Holy Spirit following of him, so many days of patience waiting upon him; all of which he negligently, nay wilfully slighted; <HI>Christ would have gathered him, and he would not;</HI> God would have saved him, and he rejected it; heaven and happiness waited upon him to be made his, and he scorned them. These though poor Heathen will not be acquainted
<PB N="177" REF="000581_0182_0FA70FBEA99C2538"/>
withal. There is no wood will burn so fiercely and make so hot a fire, as that of a barren fig-tree, when it is cut down, and cast into unquenchable flames.</P>

<P N="2">2. Consider the <HI>Ax lies at your root.</HI> God hath brought it thither; are there none of the fore-runners of your ruine come upon you? are there no spiritual beginnings to∣wards it? doth not the spirit of God begin to withdraw his strivings in the means of grace? do you not find your selves more careless and secure under, and more impene∣trable by the Word of God which is dispen∣sed to you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are you not more delighted with, and more violently set in your hearts to live still in your sinful courses? are there no temporal fore-runners of this? do not Gods Servants proclaim his wrath awfully against you? doth not Gods Providence raise up evil, and fearful judgments against you? are there not those infirmities and sicknesses, which are the presage of death upon you? these all have a voice in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Think now what a terrible thing it is to be cut down for your barrenness, <HI>Do not make a mock at destruction,</HI> but be afraid of excision; consider therefore.</P>
<P N="1">1. What a loss you will then sustain. Then will you lose all at once, and for ever. You are then cast out of the vineyard, and all the advantages of it are gone, no more to be recruited: then you will have no more Sabbaths, no more counsels, and instructions,

no more warnings and calls, no more secret strivings of the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, no more day of grace, no more hopes of salvation to E∣ternity. Is it a light matter with you now to think of losing all these? I can assure you that it will not be so in the recognition: when you shall look back from the pit whi∣ther you are going, <HI>and from whence there is no returning,</HI> and there remember all these things, it will be a far more bitter <HI>momento</HI> than <HI>Jerusul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms</HI> was in the Land of <HI>Assyria.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. What an account you will have to give in to God when he shall come to cut you down. Then will you wish that you had ne∣ver grown in such a Soil, been within such a pale, enjoyed so much cost and labour as was laid out upon you: then will you wish that you had grown in the remotest Desart, where God and Christ had never been heard of. When God shall count up to you all that he hath done for you, all the priviledges which you enjoyed by his benignity, all the free offers that he made to you, and endeavours which he industriously used with you, to per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wads you to give up your selves to his fear, and service, and all the patience with which he waited upon you, and all the wilful scorn and contumely which you cast upon this; and it will be a most fearful reckoning.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE III. <HI>That unfruitful Professors are not only unprofi∣table in, but also very hurtful to Gods Vine∣yard.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis the Landlord insinuates as a reason why he will have this figtree to be cut down, <HI>why cumbers it the ground!</HI> Not on∣ly, why doth it bear no fruit; why doth it do not good? why doth it make me to lose all my cost and care about it? The word [<HI>cumber</HI>] as was formerly intimated, signifies, to render a things idle, to make it to do no work; and it is <HI>the ground</HI> that it doth this detriment unto: and under this resemblance we may take the occasion to observe how not only useless, but mischie∣vous too, barren professors are in the visi∣ble Church: and there are several things by which it may be illustrated.</P>
<P N="1">1: A barren fruit-tree in a vineyard is a very great disgrace to it. The credit of a vineyard, is that it yields much fruit: this
<PB N="184" REF="000581_0189_0FA70FC866814108"/>
is it which gains it esteem, and makes it to he preferred before the wilderness. Every tree then that bears proportionably, confers its share to this credit, and consequently, any one that bears nothing diminisheth from it, and is oftentimes more taken notice of than the others that do bear; &amp; it is certain, that there is a great deal of reproach that accrues to the Church of Christ, by the occa∣sions of those in it that do not bring forth the fruits which God requires of them. As God expects more, so men look for more of such than of others: and as it is a shame for such who make an eminent profession, and have so many advantages for it, to do nothing for the glory of God, so the reflexion is wont to be made upon the whole, and the Church of Christ which they appertein unto must have dirt cast upon them for it; and they shall suffer more reproach for one such, than get commendation from an hundred exemplary Christians, from the world, who envy the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their reputation, and wait for matter of scandal against them. This is one argument <HI>Paul</HI> useth with the Jews to convince them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 24. men are ready to measure all by that one, these are your Church-Members, these are the Children of the Church, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have owned the Covenant, and openly pro∣fessed their subjection thereunto, and yet such they are, and so they live; and what shall
<PB N="185" REF="000581_0190_0FA70FC901B3A370"/>
judge of the rest of them? Thus Christ's Vineyard gets a bad name by such as these.</P>
<P N="2">2. A barren tree in the vineyard, takes up the room which might be better employed. There is a considerable quantity of ground allowed for a tree to stand and grow in: he who plants an Orchard, allows convenient dist∣ances, for the trees to spread themselves in, &amp; to have the advantage of the Sun-beams, that so they may have the help afforded them that is requisite for their flourishing, and bearing of fruit: now if the tree be unfruitful, all this ground is lost, and left, idle, as to any profit, it is as good to have nothing at all upon it, as that which yields nothings; and that must needs be a cumber: and in the mean while it occupies the place in which a∣nother that would bear, might stand: The same ground would do for a fruitful tree, that is lost upon a barren one; and if there were such as one there, the same ground and the same tillage would be serviceable for something; whereas this turns to no account at all. Unregenerate Sinners, that do no∣things for God, take up as much room in the visible Church as others, they have a like out∣ward priviledges with them; but the room they occupy is lost as to them: if in their stead there were such as love God, as fear and serve him, such means and advantages
<PB N="186" REF="000581_0191_0FA70FCA02103E78"/>
would forward them abundantly, and what a cumber must God needs account this to be?</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence, a barren tree in a vineyard draws away the sap and strength of the ground to no purpose. The ground spends, and its vertue is as much exhausted by main∣taining a barren tree, as one that bears ne∣ver so much fruit: it sucks away its vertue, and makes it require as much mending, and all for nothing: and this is really mischie∣vous to it. It is the same Soil to appearance, the same fruitful hill in which Hypocrites and formal Professors are planted, that sin∣cere Christians grow in, for G<HI>ods vineyard is upon a fruitful hill, Isa.</HI> 5. 1. and the same means are used with them, the same cost is laid out upon the one and the other, so far as concerns means, for God demands <HI>what he could do more, verse</HI> 3. and it is by a formal improvement of these, that an Hypocrite maintains his profession, and makes such a flourish in those leaves which he bears. It is from the vineyards fatne's that he sucks up his formality, makes his brags and boasts, and by which he upholds himself, or else he would wither away quickly; and by this means it comes to be spent unprofitably, and to damage.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hence, all that is done to the barren tree, is thrown away upon it. All the digging and
<PB N="187" REF="000581_0192_0FA70FCA91050E40"/>
mending, all the showers and dews which fall upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, all the warm sun, beams that influence it turn to no account, because it is barren still: for if it bears no fruit it doth nothing to answer the end for which it was there planted. And thus it is in respect of such as bring forth no spiritual fruit in the Church of God: not only do they themselves miss of their end and Gods just expectation, but all that is done for them doth, for the present, prove frustrate also: That God will be no loser in the and by them, is no thank to them, they do all that in them lies to defeat him; and did not his Infi∣nite Wisdom know how to make his penniworths out of them, he should never get any thing by them. But however, the direct and next end of all means being their serving</HI> G<HI>od, and doing good works, this is altogether frustrated by them▪ all the Sabbaths they enjoy, and Ordinances they partake in are lost, all the</HI> dews of Heaven <HI>that fall upon them are dried up, and no good comes of them; all the mercies &amp; afflictions that are expend∣ed on them make them worse. the</HI> Stone wall, <HI>&amp;</HI> Wine-press <HI>and</HI> Tower <HI>are kept up and repai∣red in vain as to them: and, in as much as they belong to the Vineyard, that is also damnifi∣ed hereby.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. A Barren tree in a vineyard doth dam∣age to all the plants that grow near it. It is not only useless in it self, but others that are planted within it's verge and shadow are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amnified by it, they are great sufferers for
<PB N="188" REF="000581_0193_0FA70FCE26D11688"/>
its vicinity, it draws away the sap from them which might have nourished, and made them more fruitful; it shades them, keeps off the influences of the Sunbeams from them, and so they are stunted, their flourishing is pre∣vented by it, and their fruit hath neither so good a colour nor tast as else it would and this is much to the vineyards detriment. And truly empty and barren professours in the vi∣sible Church, do a great deal of harm to others in the society which they belong unto, and especially to such as they have the most inti∣mate converse withal: and there are several ways in which they are harmful to others and hinder bearing: especially;</P>
<P N="1">1. Such as these encourage one another by evil counsels, and society, in their unprofi∣table and pernicious courses: and by this means they wonderfully hinder the efficacy of the means of grace upon them, how many good motions of the Spirit upon their Souls are by these ways quenched; the word of God takes hold of this or that barren soul in an ordinance, and leaves awaknings upon him, and this is one step to fertility, if it were followed; but he gets among his vain lewd companions, and they draw him away again to his former courses, and make him to lose all those impressions which he had upon his mind: and if they observe any dis∣quietment to be upon his spirit, they either,
<PB N="189" REF="000581_0194_0FA70FCFE48628A0"/>
mock or collouge him out of it. How do vain young men strengthen each other in wickedness, and harden one anothers hearts against the fear of God! how often have there been good hopes that these and those might have been perswaded to return to God, and lay hold on <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> if they had not li∣ved in such houses, or associated themselves with such persons, where they have been en∣couraging one another in wickedness, and been learning each of the other to laugh at the counsels and warnings of God, and to <HI>make a mock of sin,</HI> and flout at <HI>G</HI>odliness, thus are we told, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9. 18. <HI>one sinner de∣stroyeth much good.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their example is pernicious to many, and especially the example of those who talk much, and speak high of Religion, and have made a more open profession of the Covenant of <HI>G</HI>od: and this more principal∣ly in reference to such as have a peculiar re∣lation to or dependance upon them; such are Parents in respect to their Children, Fa∣mily <HI>G</HI>overnours relating to them that are under their watch; when possibly they keep up a form of Godliness, as to matters of external worship; they read the Word, and pray in their families, and Catechise their Children; are constant in frequenting Ordi∣nances; and in the mean while, they are careless in their conversation, are vain and
<PB N="190" REF="000581_0195_0FA70FD1B9ACD8C8"/>
frothy in their communication, quarrelsome and give ill language in their passion, deceit∣ful in their dealings with men, loose in their ordinary carriage, and too excessive in their allowances of themselves in the using, or ra∣ther abusing the things of this life: oh what an influence have such examples upon others? how can they draw them down into self-Just∣ification? and plead, that if such things were not consistant with Christianity, these would not so do: such persons are the Devils Decoys with which he draws men in∣to the snare, and keeps them from devoting themselves wholly to the Service of God, and doing the works of Righteousness, see how <HI>Paul</HI> acquits himself from any such things as this, 1 Thes. 2. 10. <HI>Ye are Witnesses, and</HI> G<HI>od also, how holily and justly, and un∣blameably we behaved our selves among you that believe.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They many times damp the graces of true believers; and thereby they prevent their bearing so much fruit as else they would. The fruit that <HI>G</HI>od looks for, is the exercise of those <HI>G</HI>races which he hath put into us. They therefore that have no Grace, can bear no fruit; they that have it, may be hindred by occasion of some obstructi∣on given to their grace in its exercise: a bea∣ring tree may by some casualty miss a season; and how os<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doth the Society of Carnal pro∣fessors
<PB N="191" REF="000581_0196_0FA70FD1F8BDF488"/>
hinder Christians in their work? Gods Children draw out each others <HI>G</HI>race, by mu∣tual excitation; and they are many times damped and suppressed by vain communicati∣on; and carnal professors do much this way, by offering vain converse, unprofitable dis∣course, and often by stirring up the corrupti∣ons of the Godly, for they also have a body of Death, which is sometimes set on going, &amp; advantaged by the communication of others, and none more like to do it, than such as are themselves without the <HI>root of the matter in them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. These do oftentimes set themselves to oppose the power of Godliness; and this produceth pernicious effects among visible professors, and it is not unusual that these that are most zealous for set forms, are most opposite to the power. Such were the <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rifees,</HI> who were great, sticklers for the traditions of their fathers, but would <HI>neither enter into the Kingdom of Heaven themselves nor suffer them that would.</HI> And it is certain, that when men dwindle away into formality, the Life of Religion is wanting, how then should the good fruits of it appear? and what woful ruines this hath-brought to Christiani∣ty, and how it hath almost brought the Visi∣ble Church into a Wilderness of profaness and immorality, is awfully to be observed and while men spend their time and thoughts in

things of little or no moment, meer shadows, they lose the substance, and there is but a lifeless carcass of Religion left among them.</P>
<P N="6">6. All this barrenness turns to the owners damage. He in the mean while hath not his revenue coming in: it is his cost and care that is laid out on the Vineyard, and he loseth it when this and that tree returns him no fruit. <HI>G</HI>ods name is greatly dishonoured by such professors; it is his tribute which is due to him from his vineyard, that by this occasion is not paid to him: and this also is to the grief of his people that feat him: all that, being in the Church, are sincerely devoted to <HI>G</HI>od, and set for his glory, are greatly grieved, when they see that he is not ac∣knowledged by such as bear his name, and partake in his Gospel favours, Psal. 119. 165. <HI>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, be∣cause men keep not thy Law:</HI> and as long as such are in the vineyard, the Godly are kept in mourning, and their hearts are sorrow∣ful, and this is a great cumber to them.</P>

<P>For Conviction; it shews the great equity of Gods <HI>cutting down</HI> such as these. It saith that there is no injustice with God when he
<PB N="193" REF="000581_0198_0FA70FD4BB514998"/>
so doth; nay that he doth nothing but what is proper and requisite: let it therefore tell all such, what reason you have to expect it; If a tree doth no good, and a great deal of hurt, what shall be done with it else? and that you may see and be convinced of this, let me offer these things:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>G</HI>ods tenderness hath been already de∣clared to you, in and by all that patience which he hath used with you, and the cost that he hath laid out upon you. God will for ever be acknowledged, and you shall be enforced to confess, that he did not deal with you as he might have done, that he did not execute all the rigour of his Justice up∣on you which you deserved: hear how Christ expostulates with <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in this regard, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 37. your very station in his Church: all the offers of grace made to you; and all the strivings of his holy spirit with yea, and all the long time wherein he waited upon you, will witness for him, that you undid your selves, that you were the blameable cause of your own destruction: every time that he came and said to you, <HI>Oh turn! why will you die? receive instruction &amp; live,</HI> which you slight∣ed, will say that you undid your selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. Gods Wisdom is now deeply concerned in this matter. If after all, you remain barren, you cannot expect but that a, wise God will deal with you so, as shall commend that wis∣dom
<PB N="194" REF="000581_0199_0FA714B8B4475CA0"/>
of his to the world: and therefore, what would be acknowledged to be wisdom in him that owns a vineyard, in his dealing with a barren tree in it, must be much more Justified in Gods dealings with, and proceed∣ings against you, for not serving of him, here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no loss to the Owner in cut∣ting such a tree down. It never did any good by standing there; it brought in no pro∣fit to the husbandman; his revenue will be never the less when that is gone: and what glory will God lose by you, when you are destroyed? you never did him any service since you were born; he hath been at a great deal of cost upon you, but there hath no good at all come of it; you have stood in the vineyard, but all that you have done hath bin to make a shew, to take up a room there; but if none in his Church should do him more service than you have done, he might even throw it up to the waste Wilderness a∣gain, for any revenue that is paid him; and is it not wisdom to remove an unprofitable Creature from the earth, and lay out no more upon it to no purpose?</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a great deal of harm occasio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned by letting such a tree stand any longer. <HI>It cumbers the ground:</HI> it doth mischief in the place that it takes up; and is it not prudence in the Owner, to root up a tree that not

only doth no good, but much damage? if he could Bear with the former, yet this is an in∣tolerable provocation. Every unregenerate sinner among <HI>G</HI>ods people doth mischief, o∣thers are the worse for him, and therefore it is fitting that God, who is resolved to be no loser by any, should take such away from do∣ing any more: so many years as they have been born with, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exercised his patience.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it is for the good of others that such should be cut down. <HI>G</HI>od <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th a care for his vineyard in general and for those Plants in it in particular as do bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: It is for the sake of the Righteous ones there that he keeps it up! and therefore he will take care for their good. And indeed there is great benefit accrues to others by such Judgments of <HI>G</HI>od: It sometimes doth good by awakening of others that were unfruitful be∣fore, and hastning their Conversion; the de∣struction of one impenitent sinner, is some∣times the occasion of the repentance of ma∣ny: sometimes it gives great advantage to Gods Children, by removing hindrances of their growth out of the way, and awakning and exciting of the graces that are in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is the only way that is now left for <HI>G</HI>od to get honour by such as these what would you have God to do with you? serve and honour him you will not, he hath tried and waited, and all to no purpose, you grow

<P>For Information in two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. This tells us how admirable Gods for bearance is towards unregenerate sinners un∣der the <HI>G</HI>ospel. That he should wait so long∣from one year to another, and see how they neglect his grace, and dishonour his name, and yet still he holds his hand back, and not fall upon them in his sury, pluck them up and cast them out of his vineyard: are they such a cumber, do they do no good and withall do such a world of harm to o∣thers? It must needs be a matter of asto∣nishment to think that God should not long ago have bin weary with waiting upon them, that he hath not rid himself of Creatures so burdensom to him: Nay it should commend the grace of <HI>G</HI>od to his own Children, who
<PB N="197" REF="000581_0202_0FA714BAE86969C8"/>
consider how little th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> bear, how short they come of answering <HI>G</HI>ods just expecta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣on, yea and how much their little fruitful∣ness doth bring of dishonour to God, and offer of scandal to the Gospel.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here see a reason why <HI>G</HI>od sometimes takes away his Gospel, and the means of grace from a people. There is a parity of reason between a tree in the vineyard, and the vine∣yard it self; especially if we consider that it consists of individual trees: If then a fig-tree waited upon to no purpose, abiding barren after all, must come to <HI>cutting down</HI> at last, what may be expected concerning an Orchard of trees, when they come to be all, or most part so? The whole ground that they grow in is lost, and <HI>cumbred</HI> by them. Well then may it be expected, that God will not long keep up the <HI>fence</HI> about such a piece of ground, so unprofitable to him. It may therefore put a people upon serious enquiry, when God begins to lay them waste by desolating Judgments, whether it be not so with them: and it is an awful truth, that though God sometimes keeps up the pale, continues the Gospel, for the sake of a few that are preci∣ous to him, and do honour him by their ferti∣lity; yet when degeneracy overspreads, and those few can do no good, he <HI>plucks up the ledges, and lays open the vineyard;</HI> and if it be a thing so pernicious for a vineyard to be

Who would not ease himself of a load, and discharge his ground of a <HI>cum∣ber! G</HI>od gives this for a reason why this tree is to be <HI>cut down;</HI> and if you are so, it saith that you are under the peril of this doom every day; and what is the voice of

this Conviction, but to stir you up to be no longer so? and let it also rouse the be∣lievers to more renewed endeavours after fruitfulness, considering that if no fruit makes one a <HI>cumber,</HI> little fruit is little better; and consequently that the way for you to become great blessings to the Church of God, and acceptable to God himself, and to enjoy a stable settlement of abode in his Church, and to do much good there in your Generation, is to be abounding in the ser∣vice of God, and deeply engaged in those works of holiness and righteousness, which he hath required of his people. This will be the way to prevent excision, and to enjoy all merciful tillage, and the tender care of <HI>G</HI>od for you.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. It is the disposition of Gods faithful Mini∣sters to be very earnest with him to stay his judgments, when they are ready to break in upon and destroy barren Pro∣fessors.</HEAD>
<P><HI>When they see the tokens of Gods anger appear∣ing, and are apprehensive of the great danger im∣pending; they presently address God, and go to him with greatest importunity, entreating him that he would at least spare them a little give then a lit∣tle further trial, and see what may be do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with them. That</HI> G<HI>od is pleased to discover his dis∣pleasure to them, and give them some signal to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens that there is wrath out against such, and really to break forth in some terrible dispensations, some∣times discovering it in its moral causes, and some∣times in the Face of his providence, hath been al∣ready evidenced. And what is it they now do? do they sit still, and do nothing? or do they rejoice in it, and seek the fartherance of it? no, but they do all they can to prevent it, and this is one thing, they apply themselves unto</HI> G<HI>od by humble and earnest supplication, they turn importunate beggars at the Throne of</HI> G<HI>race in their behalf. Instances for this we have several in the word of God, in such as have been the most eminent:
<PB N="204" REF="000581_0209_0FA714C6E494D288"/>
How observable is the example of</HI> Abraham, <HI>in his interceeding for</HI> Sodom, <HI>on supposition that there might be a shattering of Godly persons in it? and how doth bee grow upon</HI> G<HI>od in his pleading?</HI> Gen. 18. <HI>How eminent was</HI> Moses <HI>also upon this account how often are we told of the great provocations that</HI> G<HI>od had taken at</HI> Israel? <HI>and as often we find</HI> Moses <HI>upon his Face, begging and pleading as for his life, and not letting</HI> G<HI>od alone,</HI> Fourty days <HI>at a time did he spend more then once upon this very score. How ready is</HI> Aaron <HI>to step in with his</HI> Censer between the living and the dead, <HI>when he saw</HI> the Plague was now begun? <HI>How did</HI> Joshua fall down and <HI>pray hard when Israel fled before their ene∣mies?</HI></P>
<P>How did the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> pray for a degenerate People near destruction, even till God bad him to <HI>pray no more</HI> but to <HI>let him alone?</HI> and these are to Cheractarize such as are in publick place among Gods People, and to let us know what spirit they are of. Here then may we enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whence it is that this disposition comes to be so active in Godly Ministers?</P>
<P N="2">2. Wherein it appears acceptable to God, and advantageous unto Barren Souls?</P>
<P N="1">1. Whence is it that this disposition comes to be so active in Godly Ministers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may come at this in a few steps;</P>
<P N="1">1. There is Planted in Man by Nature a
<PB N="205" REF="000581_0210_0FA714C6F6E6B7D0"/>
Love to Mankind. Meerly sensible creatures have such an instinct of Nature in them, that they stand affected to their own kind. Ravening Wolves, and Cruel Tygers do participate in this: And this had a more pe∣culiar impression upon reasonable creatures, whose understanding hath a capacity of reaso∣ning it self into, and stirring up of these af∣fections. And although it be one of the un∣happy fruits of mans Apostacy, that it hath wofully depraved this principle, and made men <HI>without natural affection</HI> having at least destroyed the gracious impression which was upon this principle, yet there is the root of such an inclination abiding in the hearts of men, and a disposition in them to exert it in a natural, though not in a gracious way.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Grace of <HI>G</HI>od, where it comes, re∣stores this principle again to its regular acti∣vity. It is the work of Sanctifying grace to restore the lapsed nature of man to a capacity of acting according to the Image of <HI>G</HI>od which once it had upon it. It Sanctifies the under∣standing, by discovering to it what is the love which we ow one to another, and wherein it ought more peculiarly to exert it self, accor∣ding to the state and condition of the object of it, and shews them that their souls are more deeply concerned in this than their bo∣dies; that their eternal well-being is more to be sought than their temporal solicity. And
<PB N="206" REF="000581_0211_0FA714C7A6AEEC70"/>
it Sanctifies the Will by enabling it to elect accordingly: and this influenceth the Affections making them to desire, long after, and solli∣citously pursue this designe: it turns that love which before was carnal into an holy love.</P>
<P N="3">3. This love makes them exceeding loth that any should perish; and consequently grieved at the apprehension of the danger of it. It is an Affection full of compassion; and therefore misery and danger of the Object greatly moves it. How much of this was exemplarily found in the man <HI>Christ,</HI> who <HI>wept over Jerusalem?</HI> Luk. 19. 41. and made that bitter moan over it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 37. and this made <HI>Paul</HI> to speak with tears in his eyes to his <HI>Philippians,</HI> Phil. 3. 18, 19. <HI>G</HI>odly Men cannot but be deeply concerned to see Sinners running to ruine, and ready to drop into destruction; to think that such as are capable of glory, should fall into endless mi∣sery; to see the hand of God up, and ready to strike that blow which will cut them off for ever from all hope; fills their souls with deepest commiseration of them, and makes them wish it might be prevented.</P>
<P N="4">4. This lothness and grief of theirs puts them upon studying and endeavouring all they may to prevent it. For that is the ve∣ry nature and use of this affection; and it is very prevalent in the souls of Gods people.
<PB N="207" REF="000581_0212_0FA714C92A3F3750"/>
Such an one will now entertain himself with these thoughts: Is there nothing that I may do to save this soul? may I be no ways in∣strumental of good to him, that so he may not go down to the pit? are there no en∣deavours that may be used with or for him, that may, by the blessing of God, prove be∣neficial to him? he is willing and desirous to do his utmost, and omit nothing that comes within his reach, that may be serviceable to this purpose. This made <HI>Paul</HI> to be so la∣borious, <HI>if by any means he might save men.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This makes them to go to God and plead with him, that he would spare them a little longer. They are not without hope that if they might have a little more time al∣lowed them, they might at length be perswa∣ded <HI>to mind the things of their peace?</HI> to be sure they know, that if they are once cut down by the hand of Gods vengeance, there will then be no more opportunity for them for ever, that all hopes are then gone, that then the day of grace is done: but whilst there is life and means, there is hope: and this makes them to pray hard for them, and follow the Throne of Grace in their behalf: and the more their danger is, the greater im∣portunity it urgeth them unto: This made <HI>Samuel</HI> so restlesly importunate for <HI>Saul.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Gods faithful Ministers are usually more deeply sensible of the miserable condition
<PB N="208" REF="000581_0213_0FA714CA22155780"/>
that such are in, than others are. Every true believer hath more or less of this sense? it flows from the Grace that is in them: but those <HI>G</HI>racious souls whose peculiar business lies in the contemplation of the Scriptures, <HI>&amp;</HI> acquainting of themselves, that so they may acquaint others with the great and awful truths therein contained, must needs have some special impressions of these things made upon their hearts, and this must needs work answerably on their affections. That was it which so engaged <HI>Paul</HI> he <HI>knew the terrors of the Lord,</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 11. Yea, and God often∣times gives them more experimental know∣ledge of themselves and that adds unto the Affection matter of incitement.</P>
<P N="7">7. The special relation which these bear to such, makes them peculiarly sollicitious for them. They are not only related to them as their fellow reasonable Creatures, but also as God hath Commissionated them to bring the Gospel of peace unto them, and labour with them for their saving good: they are therefore tende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em; they are their charge and they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them as so many children they have travailing pains for them, that they may be made partakers in saving Grace and brought to Christ: thus <HI>Paul</HI> argues with his <HI>Galati∣ons, Gal.</HI> 4. 19. And who is so much grieved at the childrens disafter as the mother, and therefore none will beg harder for them then shew.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="209" REF="000581_0214_0FA714CAACD7EF48"/>
8. They must needs be exceeding loth that all the labour which they have laid out upon these should thus be lost. Gods Ser∣vants, <HI>that have obtained the grace to be faith∣ful,</HI> have been spending themselves in solici∣tous endeavours after the salvation of all those that are under their watch; they have laboured with God and with them; and the joy they have looked for, hath been to see them saved: In hope of this they have been chearful under all; and must they perish at last, and so all be thrown away? this, in this life, is exceeding bitter to them; <HI>Paul</HI> speaks it with grief, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 11. and such a thought puts a peculiar impression upon this affection, and raiseth them to the more earnestness in their pleadings with <HI>G</HI>od.</P>
<P N="9">9. And they truly design the glory of God in all this. All believers are set for <HI>G</HI>od's glory; his Ministers are specially advantaged for the promoving of it: now it is the glo∣ry of Gods grace which they are nextly and directly to aim at the furtherance of; for they are a Gospel Ministry; and that is then most gloriously advanced, when men are made the monuments of this Attribute. When therefore they see such to whom this grace hath been offered, now ready to be made a Sacrifice unto Justice for their contempt of it, they, not being hopeless but that Grace may still be advanced by them, put in for a
<PB N="210" REF="000581_0215_0FA714CB685C9C70"/>
little respite to be afforded them: and tho' love to man excite pity in them, yet love to <HI>G</HI>od, and the honour of his Name regulates them, as will be afterwards made evident.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wherein it appears acceptable to God, and advantageous to barren souls, that these are thus earnest with <HI>G</HI>od for them?</P>
<P>A. <HI>This will be evident by the Considera∣tion of these things;</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath by his Holy Spirit put such desires into his Servants. They are the product of his Grace in them; and therefore we shall find that such as have been most eminent for Holiness, and most acquainted with <HI>G</HI>od, have been most fervently engaged thus: <HI>Abraham</HI> Gods <HI>friend, Moses,</HI> who was in the <HI>Mount</HI> with God, <HI>Paul,</HI> that had been in the <HI>Third Heaven,</HI> and seen glorious things there: and that which is the fruit of Gods grace in us must needs be acceptable to him; whether be intends to do the thing or no, yet it pleaseth him that his Servants should request it of him; for that may be our du∣ty to ask, which it is not Gods Soveraign Pleasure to grant; for the command, which is revealed, and not the decree, which is secret, is the rule in prayer. The Prophets therefore interposed most earnestly when God threatned most sharply.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God hath therefore in the Scripture made i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their duty thus to put in and plead, when they
<PB N="211" REF="000581_0216_0FA714CD10223FC0"/>
see his Judgments coming upon his people. When they apprehend that</HI> G<HI>od is angry, and discover him as if he were coming to cut Sinners down in his wrath, now God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld have these step in: for this reason; when God had threatned a terrible Calamity upon his people</HI> Israel, <HI>we find this to be urged as a precept at such a time,</HI> Joel. 2. 17. <HI>and</HI> Moses <HI>by Gods Appointment, sends</HI> Aa∣ron <HI>with his</HI> Censer, <HI>when the</HI> plague is begun. <HI>These are some of those that are appointed to</HI> stand in the gap, <HI>and if when God comes in Displeasure, and finds them not there, it fares ill with his people.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God hath oftentimes a purpose to delay the execution of the sentence; and he honours these his Servants to be the instruments in it. God sometimes intends to give peculiar instances of his long-sufferance; and therefore when Sinners may be thought ripe for ruine, ready for cutting down, and the sentence is past in the threatning; he will yet give them a farther trial; now when it is so, he is wont to stir up the hearts of his servants to put in, and beg with greatest and un∣deniable importunity for it, whereupon he grants it to their requests; and it is for their sakes that he doth it. Thus we find, that</HI> G<HI>od had certainly destroyed Israel, but that</HI> Moses <HI>interposed, and stood between him and them, and</HI> turned his wrath away, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 23. <HI>and this shews his approbation.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence it follows, that they do many
<PB N="212" REF="000581_0217_0FA714CE19E21558"/>
times prevail with God. Though sometimes it is come to that, that though <HI>Noah, Job, Daniel</HI> should pray for them, <HI>they should only deliver their own souls;</HI> yet it is not always so; if it be possible, such prayers shall prevail, and <HI>G</HI>od not seldom doth thus answer them. There is many a Sinners life is saved by the earnest importunity of Gods Servants with him, they had died else: God gives their lives to these prayers, to testifie what an in∣terest they have in him, and convince sinners themselves o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their gracious acceptance with him. The very scope of this part of the Parable, is to let us know, that God spares many after they have provoked him to de∣nounce some severe threatnings against them, and to tell us how it comes about that he so doth: it is not for any worthiness or merit of theirs, but because they have a deep share in his favour, and he will thus signalize it.</P>
<P N="5">5. By this means the Judgment that was ready to cut them down, is deferred. When the Ax of Divine Vengeance was lifted up, and just falling down upon them to give them a deadly blow, these hold Gods hands, and keep them from doing execution: and now the Sinner is suffered to live a while longer; the mischief which he was falling into is diverted from him; and this is an ad∣vantage; every day and hour in which the condemned Creature is saved out of the <HI>p</HI>it,
<PB N="213" REF="000581_0218_0FA714CE77AE9BB0"/>
is a rich favour to him, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3. 22. <HI>It is the Lords mercy that we are not consumed;</HI> and the rather because,</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus they have a farther opportunity given them to seek an escape from that de∣struction, if they have but an heart to make use of it. How many wretched sinners have great reason to say; if I had died at such a time, when I was just at brink of the pit, and had a Sentence of Death upon me in my own apprehension, I had then certainly perished; I had gone to everlasting burnings; but God hath spared me, and given me a longer day of grace. Till the tree is cut down, all hopes concerning it are not utterly lost; but when it is destroyed, and the root is dead, then all hope is gone: and needs must it be a very great priviledge for a sinner to have farther day given him, and <HI>a price</HI> continued in his <HI>Hand to get Wisdom;</HI> if he <HI>Wants an Heart</HI> to it, it is his own wickedness; that he hath the opportunity, is <HI>G</HI>ods indulgence.</P>

when Judgment was ready to have broken in, and <HI>G</HI>ods anger was kindled, and began to burn, these have stept in, and given a stop to it. It is true, they dealt plainly and openly with such as live and lie in sin, and despise the offers of grace made in the Gospel; and this is their faithfulness: they have discove∣red Gods anger, and cannot but <HI>cry aloud,</HI> and call earnestly unto men; they cannot let them alone; they speak home, and this many times vexeth sinners; they love not to be disquiet∣ed; and this makes such to cry out of them, as if they were the only <HI>Troublers of Israel.</HI> Yea they are often put upon it to denounce the threatnings of the Word of God against men that will not repent; and foolish crea∣tures are ready to say, we see what they would be at, they desire and long for our mischief: but little do they think the mean while, what deep resentments they entertain upon their hearts of these things; how the danger they are in affects them.

to your anger, that they may do you good? did they not love you, would they set themselves so earnestly to implore God for you, and seek your preservation? They hate your sins indeed, because they know that they will undo you, if not forsaken: but they love your Souls, and therefore seek their Salva∣tion. If they did not love you, they would not willingly stand between an angry God, and angry sinners. Would you but solemnly think what it is for that they are treating so seriously with you, you would be per∣swaded of this, that they are unweariedly bent to seek your salvation; and if this be not love, what is.</P>
<P N="3">3. Think then that it is your interest to hearken to them. It fares with <HI>G</HI>ods Mini∣sters as it did with <HI>Joshua, Israel fly before their enemies; Joshua falls upon his Face and prays;</HI> and <HI>G</HI>od saith to him, what makest thou here? <HI>up, Israel hath sinned,</HI> Thus <HI>G</HI>ods servants see the owner of the vineyard angry, and hear him speak of cutting down such a fig-tree, they beg of him to spare it a little, not to be so angry; and God saith to them, go see if such an one will be re∣formed, amended, and bear fruit, else I will certainly Cut him down. For this reason therefore they come unto you: and for this end they set themselves to convince, reprove, warn, counsel, entreat,
<PB N="220" REF="000581_0225_0FA714D5F9ED3170"/>
you. And let it be a Solemn word to urge this advice upon you, to consider that if they cannot after all prevail with you to entertain their Counsels, they will not be long able to hold Gods hands; but he will say to them, pray no more for that sinner. It may be this year also he may wait, but if still you continue as you were, what shall become of you next, the Lord knows, <HI>But if you, hear your Souls shall live.</HI></P>

It is true, there is only the int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cession it self expressed in the parable, but our Saviours de∣sign is to intimate, both that there was such a delay granted, and how it was obtained, and what was the motive for the one to ask, and the other to grant; and it is determined in this. There are two things whereof a di∣stinct account may be here enquired after?</P>
<P N="1">1. What influence this reason hath into the desires of <HI>G</HI>ods servants, to make them so earnest for a year longer?</P>
<P N="2">2. On what account this argument &amp; plea of theirs prevails with God?</P>
<P N="1">1. What influence this reason hath into the desires of Gods servants, to make them so earnest for a year longer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is certain that desires have their motives, and rational desires are moved ra∣tionally. Now when Christs Messengers see the eminent danger that is over the heads of sinners, and the ax of Divine vengeance ready to <HI>cut them down;</HI> as humane pity can∣not but stir in them the bowels of com∣passion; so there is not a little in this consi∣deration to raise these desires in them to greater measures of ardency: and that in a double respect, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> both with respect to themselves, and referring to those for whom these desires are:</P>
<P N="1">1. In regard of themselves. There is a
<PB N="224" REF="000581_0229_0FA714D8E77A9CF8"/>
self-interest which Gods Ministers have in this affair, which stimulates these desires in them; and we may take a brief distinct account of it in these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are sensible of the awful charge of souls lying upon them, and the solemn account they must be called unto for them. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>re is no man that is duly qualified for the work of Christ in the Gospel, who hath not his heart affected with the frequent con∣sideration of this; who doth not often think with himself, God hath put these souls un∣der my watch, and made it my duty to give them faithful warning from him, of their misery and danger, and the duty which is re∣quired of them; and hath enjoyned me to be <HI>instant</HI> with them, <HI>in season, and out of season:</HI> to observe their state, and case, and accommodate counsels to them accordingly, and to be very earnest with them for their good; to deal with them plainly, and to with-hold no necessary and seasonable Truth from them. They often ponder on that as spoken to them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3. 17, 18. <HI>Son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the House of Isra∣el, &amp;c.</HI> and think with themselves, I must appear ere long before the dreadful Tribu∣nal of the great Judge, and then Jesus Christ will ask of me, what is become of those souls whom I so solemnly enjoyned thee to look after? where are those <HI>Sheep</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="000581_0230_0FA714DA90080100"/>
and <HI>Lambs</HI> whom I gave thee a charge to <HI>feed for me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They are also in some measure acquain∣ted with their own sinful infirmities and Temptations. <HI>G</HI>od is pleased to manage his treaty with sinners about the things which con∣cern their peace, by men of <HI>like infirmities</HI> with themselves; and he is wont to make such as he sends upon this errand to apprehend it deeply: which apprehension hath been wont to make them many times too backward in ac∣cepting the Cmomission, as judging themselves <HI>insufficient</HI> for so weighty an undertaking, and therefore we have that of <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 4. 13. <HI>Oh my Lord, send I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send:</HI> q. d. any rather than me; and of <HI>Isaiah, chap</HI> 6. 5. <HI>I am a man of unclean lips;</HI> of <HI>Jeremiah, chap.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 5. <HI>I cannot speak, for I am a child;</HI> of <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 Cor. 2. 16. <HI>who is sufficient for these things?</HI> they feel so much of a dead and insensible frame in themselves, so much want of a tender and compassinoate pity for souls, so many discou∣ragements ready to prevail over them, to make them omit their duty, or be deficient in it, which renders them apt to be jealous of themselves, and suspicious least they should give God just provocation against them,</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence when they see Gods Judgments threatning of sinners <HI>to cut them down,</HI> they reflect upon themselves and are afraid. Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="226" REF="000581_0231_0FA714DDAFC5B4B0"/>
as to their integrity, and sincere desire to he faithful, and endeavour after it; they have the <HI>witness</HI> of their <HI>consciences;</HI> yet they sus∣pect their <HI>deceitful hearts;</HI> and now be think themselves whether they have done all that they might, and had the opportunity of do∣ing, to have prevented this: have they cho∣sen suitable and seasonable subjects to insist upon? have they been distinct and particular enough in their applying of them? have they spoken plain and full? have they been earnest in it? and that both in their publick Preaching, and private advice, as there hath been opportunity? and are now ready to think, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had been more earnest and impor∣tunate, more solemn and serious, more zea∣lous and affectionate, such a sinner might pos∣sibly have been perswaded.</P>
<P N="4">4. This fear puts them upon the resoluti∣on to be more intensly engaged in this, if God shall give them a farther opportunity. Fear of Gods displeasure at them, makes them to renew their purposes, and so in quickens them in their work. This was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that made <HI>Paul</HI> to study the art of <HI>perswasion,</HI> to think that he as well as they to whom he Preached, <HI>must appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, &amp;c.</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11. they therefore draw up this resolve in themselves, that if God shall afford them more liberty to treat with such, they will be more so∣lemn
<PB N="227" REF="000581_0232_0FA714DEDB627F80"/>
with them, tell them more plainly of their sins, and of Gods Judgments; plead harder, and entreat with more tenderness and compassion than ever: and all this to discharge the obligation lying on them, and satisfie their own consciences, and so pro∣vide for their more comfortable appearing before their Judge.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Hence, that they may have farther opportu∣nity, they importunately beg for the sinners re∣prieve. They know that if he be now</HI> cut down, <HI>he will be put wholly beyond their farther care and charge; they can then no more pray for him, nor plead with him; and if they have not done all their duty to them, it will then be too late to en∣deavour it: so that their request is mainly built upon this plea, let him live, raise him up this once from death, spare him a while longer, give him a farther day, that so I may use more and more industrious endeavours with him</HI> before he goes hence, <HI>than ever I have done.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>With respect to them for whom these desires are;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>the sinners whom they see upon the brink of ruine. As it is their love to them that makes them to ask a</HI> year more <HI>for them, so a principal motive; is, that they may try farther with them, and there are these things that come into this consideration.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>They know that sinners are converted and made fruitful by the use of means. That this is the ordinary way in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which God is wont
<PB N="228" REF="000581_0233_0FA714DEF0077C88"/>
to dispense his grace to the souls of men: when therefore God intends to have a</HI> people to his praise, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e plants them into a vineyard; he sends the Gospel to them, and affords them his Ordinan∣ces. If God hath much</HI> people <HI>in</HI> Corinth, Paul <HI>must</HI> tarry <HI>and</HI> preach <HI>there; for the ga∣thering of them in: if therefore those that have so long been unprofitable, be at last made to serve God, they must be continued under the Ordinan∣ces: if the fig-tree ever comes to bear fruit, it must be be let grow in the Vineyard, and be there manured.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They also know that <HI>G</HI>od is wont to give a blessing to his Servants industry in the use of means. Though all success depends absolutely upon God, and we cannot by all our care and endeavours bring home one soul to Jesus Christ; yet because <HI>G</HI>od hath ap∣pointed the Gospel to be the instrument of Conversion and salvation; and hath required his Servants to use diligence and constancy in the dispensation of it unto men, he is there∣fore wont to encourage their industry, by gi∣ving good success unto it; not but that he useth his Soveraignty here, but he frequently doth so: <HI>Paul,</HI> who <HI>laboured more than all the Apostles,</HI> won more Souls unto Christ than a∣ny of them: Diligence must needs be nearest to success.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence the Sinners danger, moving their compassion, engageth them to be more indu∣strious with them. When they see, unregen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="229" REF="000581_0234_0FA714DFEDD67F40"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men, by neglecting a day of grace, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve provoked God to just anger, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger to discover it self in the tokens of his righteous severity, their hearts are thereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irred in them, and they commiserate their dolefully dangerous condition, and that puts them to study what is their duty in this case, to prevent it: and because all that is in their power to do, is to be more earnest and in∣stant in labouring with them for their good; now they shake off all their indispositions, and give themselves up to their work; they say, if I will not have this sinner to perish, <HI>I must pluck him as a brand out of the fire,</HI> I must <HI>cry aloud, and not spare him,</HI> but <HI>shew him his transgression,</HI> and plead harder than ever with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence they are not willing to despair but hope still concerning them. Despair of doing good, is that which e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eryates the spi∣rits, and puts a damp upon all activity, yea makes men to cast off all endeavours: where∣as on the other hand, hope oyls the wheels, warms the heart and gives activity to com∣passion: they are not therefore willing to think that sinners are hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess: though they have been careless and obstinate, yet it is pos∣sible that <HI>God may give them repentance,</HI> and they may come in at last: their ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d heart may be softned, they may be brought to see the evil of their doings, and made to mourn
<PB N="230" REF="000581_0235_0FA714E2DF5AB008"/>
for and turn from them; God can change them and means may be blessed unto them for good; they are not out of the reach of Al∣mighty power to convert and save them.</P>
<P N="5">5. This therefore makes them beg time for farther trial. They do it not with any de∣sign to aggravate the sinners guilt, though it unhappily proves so too often in the event; they would not make any mans miseries more and greater, if they could help it, but all they do in this regard, is in hope that it may be their Salvation; it is because they are not willing that these should perish: and because all their hope is in a farther probati∣on, which only will allow unto them the op∣portunity of using means for their good, or unto sinners the opportunity for repentance: They do therefore seek unto God that he would grant this their request, and for that reason the vinedresser asks but one year more because it is meerly for probation that he de∣sires it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Upon what account this argument and plea of theirs prevails with <HI>G</HI>od to let sinners alone a little longer?</P>
<P>A. We are not to suppose that mens plead∣ings, can alter Divine Purposes. Or make God to take up other resolutions concerning any than he hath from eternity determined in himself. But this is to be well remarked that God puts this into the hearts of his ser∣vants
<PB N="231" REF="000581_0236_0FA714E478674138"/>
and he puts these arguments into their mouths, and suffers these pleadings to pre∣vail with him to answer their requests; and he hath holy designs in all this. Now the reasons why God is willing to forbear, that he may so give his servants farther opportu∣nity to take pains with sinners, after they have continued barren under so many means, and so much patience as hath been already af∣forded them, are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. He doth it to give his Ministers the opportunity to discharge their Consciences, towards such Sinners: that so, <HI>whether these will hear or forbear</HI> they may <HI>save their own souls;</HI> and may have peace in themselves, in that they have done their duty to the utmost of their power. By this means their <HI>savour</HI> comes to be more <HI>sweet unto God,</HI> whether these be <HI>saved</HI> or <HI>perish.</HI> It is true, Gods Ministers need pardon of all their defects e∣very day; and if <HI>God should be strict,</HI> they could <HI>not stand:</HI> But as it cannot but be their great grief to think, these and those sinners are gone, and we have not discharged our duty to them: so, on the other hand, it will afford them great inward peace, though they cannot infallibly determine, what effect it hath wrought on them for their eternal good, yet that they have been faithful, and done their utmost as instruments in this af∣fair. We see how chearfully <HI>Paul</HI> can take
<PB N="232" REF="000581_0237_0FA714E5C195BF18"/>
his last leave of his <HI>Ephesians</HI> on this account; when he can say, <HI>Act.</HI> 20 26, 27. <HI>I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God;</HI> and God would have the souls of his faithful ser∣vants comforted in their work.</P>
<P N="2">2. God sometimes intends that some sin∣ners shall be new-born out of time. There are some of Gods Elect, that are by his holy pleasure suffered to stand for a long while in his vineyard, and to grow worse and worse under and by all the pains and cost that have been expended upon them: yea to run up to such an height of wickedness, as to pro∣voke him to break in upon them with his Judgments, and to threaten them with de∣struction; and when he hath laid them up in the irons of affliction, he then <HI>bores their ears to instruction;</HI> and so he brings them in at the last to be made the eternal monuments of his glorious <HI>G</HI>race, and to shew his migh∣ty power, by making them astonishing in∣stances of his praise. Such an one was <HI>Ma∣nass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> tells us that he was such an one too, <HI>born out of time;</HI> when therefore it is so, and such are ready to perish, he is pleased, together with putting it into the hearts of his Servants to importune him, also to let them live yet longer, that there may be an opportunity to instruct and help them to Salvation: and herein also he migh∣tily
<PB N="233" REF="000581_0238_0FA714E66960A6C0"/>
honours his Servants, by giving them the lives of such at their request.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And God sometimes doth it to make his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the more illustrious upon them at last in their destruction. It is an awful expression of the Apostle, Rom.</HI> 9. 22.

people, when his judgements are upon them for their barrenness. Whether he be like to proceed in a way of anger or to suspend his wrath. All serious souls are thoughtful at such a time, what God intends to do, and would be very glad if he would shew them a token for Good; It is true, the best and most desireable token is, when his Judgements work them up to an universal repentance and reformation: that saith that God will certainly return to them, and <HI>do them good:</HI> but mean while, it is no contempt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble presage that <HI>G</HI>od will yet spare, and delay to execute <HI>all his wrath</HI> on such a people if he produce these two things in his ser∣vants.</P>

purpose, to see if he will yet at last im∣prove the day of grace, and return to God. Such deliverances are not evidences that <HI>G</HI>od is reconciled to them, and that their state is now good, because God hath heard prayers for them, and hath spared them from just now going to the pit: no, but they in their distress made promises, that if God would restore them, and give them a little more time, they would not live as before they had done: if they might have their life given them: and a few more Sabbaths and Ordi∣nances allowed them, they would husband them better; and they who prayed with them, promised that they <HI>would dig about them, and dung them;</HI> this is the ground on which they were restored, and now they live upon trial, whether they will do so or no: and there are three things wherein this pro∣bation is to be taken notice of.</P>
<P N="1">1. It gives them a new opportunity to re∣turn to God, and live to his praise. It affords, them not only farther time, but also a renew∣ed season; it suffers them to stand still in the vineyard; it stops the ax of revenge from cutting them down; it gives them leave to go to Gods House, and there to hear his Word, and to be called upon, counselled and warned to repent; it lengthens out <HI>the day of their visitations,</HI> and holds the <HI>things of their, peace</HI> still before them: now, all the oppor∣tunities
<PB N="237" REF="000581_0242_0FA714EAB7D78458"/>
of grace which are bestowed upon men, are properly trials which God useth with them; for he will have his own glory by them in the conclusion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nay the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason upon which God gives them more time, is to see if they will do better now than they did before. It is up∣on a supposition that it will repent them af∣ter such dangers and deliverances, of their former neglects and that they will be thereby quickned to husband such an opportunity bet∣ter; God saith, surely such a sinner, whom I have brought from the gates of the grave, who hath been restored to a new life, and that when he was almost beyond hope, will lead a new life; <HI>he will surely receive instruction,</HI> and hearken to the calls of the <HI>G</HI>ospel, surely he will not after this forget <HI>G</HI>od, and return again to his old vain and sinful cour∣ses.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence if this be neglected the time is like to be short, The parable mentions but a year; and probations after provocati∣ons are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot wont to be long: when Judge∣ment is begun, God is in haste. To shew his pity, and how loth he is <HI>that sinners should perish,</HI> he will still hear a little longer: but, to shew his Holiness, he will not tarry long if the end be not answered. And there is great reason why <HI>G</HI>od should now use speed, because if such eminent deliverances

<P N="1">1. <HI>Beware of turning to your former courses again. It was our Saviours advice to one whom he had healed, Joh.</HI> 5. 14. Behold, thou ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing
<PB N="239" REF="000581_0244_0FA714EC6BE8C4B8"/>
befal thee. <HI>If you find any temptation so to do▪ check your selves with this thought, certainly God did not deliver me for this; this will be an ill re∣quital of the Lord for this great benefit to me; and know it, that if you do</HI> return to your vomit, <HI>after such afflictions, it had been better for you, if you had died under such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stroak of Gods hand, and been then sent down to the pit: little do you know what an aggravation this will will be to your guilt.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Be sure therefore now hearken to the solemn and earnest strivings with you in the Ordinances. Think when you come to the House of God again, what a mercy it is that when you were going to <HI>silence,</HI> God said <HI>re∣turn and live:</HI> now remember what it was for, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that you might have these means given you to invite you to Repentance, that are not afforded to them in the grave: If then he directs his Messengers to plead hard with you, and to lay your condition open be∣fore you, hearken as for your lives, for in∣deed <HI>it is your life;</HI> bless God that you have such another <HI>price in your hands,</HI> and be afraid of living unconverted one Sabbath more, left your hearts should grow harder again: and therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. Tremble so much as to think, that the next Judgment should come, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind you barren still. Remember, though you have escaped one, yet you are not secure; God
<PB N="240" REF="000581_0245_0FA714ED295FF310"/>
hath more ways, and more Judgments to fall upon sinners by; beware of security: It is good to be often thinking, that as you are in Gods hand, so if you should by abusing this mercy of his, and living impenitent after it, stir up his indignation, and bring another visitation upon you, what little reason there will be, that you should expect another de∣liverance; what credit would God give to your promises, who have already so broken them with him? what aggravated provocation will be thus offered to him, to forbear no more? and what matter of horror and despair will it supply your minds withal, to think that such mercies, and such endeavours have been so lamen∣tably despised by you.</P>

<P N="3">3. IT follows that we proceed to consider of the issue that the Vine-Dresser comes to with his Lord about this Fig-tree: He desires but one year more to make some farther ex∣periment upon it; and what then? why here is a double Hypothesis or Supposition that he makes about it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> either it will af∣ter this bear fruit, or else it will still remain barren; and upon each of these supposals he raiseth a rational inference or conclusion. We may in the first place take the <HI>Hypotheses</HI> themselves into consideration. The Vine dres∣ser dares not to promise any thing positively, concerning the fig-tree; being uncertain what will be the return of all his labour and pains; the farthest that he can say, is, it is
<PB N="242" REF="000581_0247_0FA714EFB09F9220"/>
possible it may hear, and possibly it may not? however, if his Lord be but willing to try, he is willing to lay out his labour upon it:</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. <HI>All the endeavours which are used by men for the rendring of Sinners fruitful, are uncertain as to the issue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>They that use them have no assurance that they shall obtain; they are not certain that sinners shall be converted, and made service∣able to the glory of God: they know not but that after all is done, they will remain as they were, as far from grace and holiness as ever. In prosecution of this Doctrine we may,</P>
<P N="1">1. Enquire upon what grounds the evi∣dence of this Truth is built, and</P>
<P N="2">2. Resolve a doubt which is apt to be rai∣sed on this consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the enquiry into the grounds of the evidence of this Truth, we may take up with these conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God knows who are appointed to obtain grace and salvation. We are not therefore to charge this uncertainty upon him, though men be at a loss, yet he is at
<PB N="243" REF="000581_0248_0FA714F026452268"/>
none: this the Apostle vindicates, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 19. <HI>The Lord knows who are his.</HI> He not only knows them in the gross, or number; but who they are personally and individually; not only how many they are, but what are their names, and in particular: <HI>he is a chosen vessel,</HI> Acts 9. 15. and this must needs be, be∣cause his free Election is the first link in the Chain, whereof eternal glory is the last, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.29, 30. when therefore it was a time of the greatest obduration upon the Nation of the <HI>Jews, Paul</HI> satisfies himself in this, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 7. <HI>The Election hath obtained it;</HI> so that in this respect, here is the greatest certainty that can be, because Gods purposes are Un∣changeable.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the means of grace are nextly and directly appointed for the benefit of these. It was for the Redemption and Salvation of Sinners, that Jesus Christ came into the World; but for which he had never engaged in the work which he undertook: and to that end that his redeemed may be brought to participate in the good which he hath procu∣sed for them, the Gospel is promulgated, and the offers and invitations to accept of peace are made to sinners: and this is the reason why the Gospel is sent to this place, and not to that, because God hath some of his chosen ones here, whom he <HI>hath loved with an everlasting love,</HI> and whom he designs
<PB N="244" REF="000581_0249_0FA714F1E5110768"/>
to <HI>call</HI> by these means, into the grace where by they may be saved: nor can it be said that ever the <HI>G</HI>ospel was sent unto such a place, where there were none of that num∣ber dwelling; though possibly there have bin more of them in some places than in others: it is therefore called <HI>the Gospel of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence all these wheresoever they are, shall sooner or later be brought in by the means of Grace. There is no uncertainty in the thing it self as to the futurition of it; that shall be a truth in the winding up, <HI>Acts.</HI> 13. 43, <HI>As many as were ordained to Eternal Life, believed;</HI> these may possibly lie a great while in their sins, and abide barren under manifold essays used with them, there may be a great deal of time and cost for the pre∣sent lost upon them; they may out-stand the three years of Patience, and fall into the one year of probation, before they bear an, fruit; but it is certain they shall turn to God before they dy, they shall not be cut down for their barrenness; they shall be born to <HI>G</HI>od, though it be out of time.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the Gospel means are sent to more than are chosen. Our Saviour more than once useth that assertion, <HI>many are called, but few are chosen,</HI> by which he doth not intend effectual vocation, for that belongs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to none but the few who are chosen, but the outward calling of the Gospel, by which men are
<PB N="245" REF="000581_0250_0FA714F37A2B53B0"/>
brought into the visible Church, and are in∣vited to come unto Christ, believing on him, to seek grace from him, whereby they may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nabled to serve him, it is therefore such a call as men refuse to close cordially withal. Those whom God hath set his love upon, are, before their conversion, among the rest of the world, they are alike as to their natural state; and those unto whom the dispensation of the <HI>G</HI>ospel is committed, do not know how to distinguish these from others, and are there∣fore enjoyned to come unto such a people, and make offers of grace universally to all that hear them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 1. <HI>Ho! every one that thirsteth come,</HI> Rev. 22. 17. <HI>whosoever will, let him take the waters of life freely;</HI> and Christ is by them as much offered to one as to ano∣ther, and they are as seriously and solemnly invited to come in unto him; and accept of his grace; and if they refuse to entertain these offers, they will be inexcusable, and their guilt will be aggravated, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15 21.</P>
<P N="5">5. We cannot know antecedently to con∣version who are chosen, <HI>i. e.</HI> by any ordina∣ry notes or signs. God did sometimes imme∣diately reveal this to his Extraordinary Am∣bassadors of old, although not always: but there are no ruies given us, by which we may conclude positively that such are Elect∣ed, and thereby encourage our selves parti∣cularly to use endeavours with them that
<PB N="246" REF="000581_0251_0FA714F46D21BDD0"/>
they may be called; there being no Scripture Rules on which we can proceed: and there∣fore such a Faith hath no foundation. There is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing in their good natures; for God sometimes chuseth the most rugged dispositi∣ons, when he passeth by the most ingenious; that <HI>young man, Mat.</HI> 19. bad fair, but he fell short: not by any impulse on our spirits, ma∣king us to be more earnest and sollicitous for them than others; for <HI>G</HI>od may thus encou∣rage endeavours in us, to make them thereby become the more inexcusable.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Men cannot convert whom they please. The new birth depends not on the</HI> wills of men Joh. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 13. <HI>Our good will may animate us to our duty and because our love to them makes us very loth that they should perish, it will excite industry in us: and Gods end is thus accomplished by us; but our</HI> G<HI>race cannot infuse it, though wee have never so much of it in us.</HI> W<HI>hat</HI> G<HI>odly Pa∣rent would lose one of his Children? What Godly Minister would lose any of his Flock?</HI> W<HI>hat God∣ly Christian would see any one of his neighbours perish if this could be? If it could be in his power to bring them home to Christ there should none of them ly out from him. Men▪ work is, in their place to endeavour this, but the efficacy of it depends upon an higher vertue;</HI> I. Cor. 3.6: I have planted, Apollos hath watered, but God gave the encrease.</P>
<P N="7">7. As none but God can bless the means
<PB N="247" REF="000581_0252_0FA714F4A7721948"/>
with success, so he doth his pleasure in it: Christ, speaking of Regeneration, tells us, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.8. <HI>The wind blow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th where it listeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit of God:</HI> As it is of grace, so that it may appear to be so. God takes and leaves as he sees meet, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 18. <HI>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</HI> All the labours of his people are under the Soveraign Dispose of his hand; they may throw out the Net, but it is he who must bring the fish into it, if they take any, or else they may <HI>toil all night and catch none:</HI> nor is he obliged to do it, he is nei∣ther obliged to sinners to convert them, for it is <HI>by grace that any are saved;</HI> nor is he engaged to such as seek and endeavour it, for he can recompense their labour fully in a∣nother way, if he please to frustrate it in the thing it self.</P>
<P N="8">8. There are none that know whether <HI>G</HI>od will give his blessing to, or with-hold it from their utmost endeavours. If he do afford it, their labour shall be succeeded, if he restrain it, sinners will remain impenitent under all. This God hath kept as a secret with himself; and therefore all our endeavours must needs be under uncertainties, and the issue must be dubious to us. Doubtless God hath holy ends in keeping his Servants in suspense; however, they are to do their work, without any demurr. <HI>Ezekiel</HI> must deliver his Mes∣sage,
<PB N="248" REF="000581_0253_0FA714F568B7A520"/>
whether the people will <HI>hear or forbear.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a doubt which calls for some reso∣lution, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Is it not matter of great dis∣couragement on the spirits of Godly men to labour under such uncertainties, or what is it that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> animate them to their work.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Flesh and Blood may possibly take dis∣couragement at it, and be ready to think, what shall I lose all my labour, and possibly, instead of bringing men to Christ, and Salva∣tion, make them worse, and encrease their condemnation? but <HI>G</HI>race will teach us other lessons. Here then let these few things be considered for our satisfaction in this point.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is all reason that God should have the soveraign disposal of his won gifts. That he be acknowledged to be supream, and arbitrary in his dispensing of himself to the children of men, must needs be his indisputa∣ble prerogative, who shall find fault with him <HI>for doing with his own what he will?</HI> if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should have left all the whole race of man kind in their natural estate, and bestowed his grace upon none of them, there would have been no ground for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind fault with him, or lay any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to his charge; for all were forfeited, and fallen into his hands, and lyable to his revenge; if then he will give his special favours to some
<PB N="249" REF="000581_0254_0FA714F66CF89A90"/>
and not to others, and that according to his own pleasure, without acquainting us with the reason of it, it concerns not us to dis∣pute, or make any demurr in our thoughts about it: the highest reason, and ultimate resolution of these things, which ought to set us down satisfied, is, <HI>what if God will, Rom.</HI> 9. 22.</P>
<P N="2">2, That every Christian is under an indis∣pensible duty in his place, to endeavour all that he can to promove the salvation of o∣thers. Ministers in their place, Parents in their place <HI>G</HI>overnours in theirs, and neigh∣bours in theirs: this is a general duty that influenceth every relation that men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> according to the different manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it is to be attended: and this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> lay men under strong engagements <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣vour it to the utmost; considering that other∣wise they will bring themselves under guilt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not be able to answer it unto God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shall call them to an account about it. For men to take any discouragement in a known duty, is to hearken to Satans temp∣tation, and to provoke God to anger against them. Though success be a great encou∣ragement in duty, yet that which firstly ought to engage the conscience of one that fears <HI>G</HI>od, is that it is his will. Duty is our part, success is his, we may desire it, and ought to pray for it; but when we have
<PB N="250" REF="000581_0255_0FA714F9D11EB890"/>
done all, we must leave it with him, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9. 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That this uncertainty carries motive in it to do duty to all. As we do not know that we shall prevail with them, when we have done all; but that they may continue in their impenitency; so on the other hand, we do not know but that we may be instrumental of doing them good, that which carnal reason takes discouragement from, that grace encourageth it self by. I am sure it is an argument which the spirit of God makes use of to animate us to this constancy,</HI> Eccl. 11. 6. <HI>If we did certainly know that such an one would grow worse by all, and at last perish after he had used utmost endeavours with him for his salvati∣on, this would make us to despair, and that would quite dishearten us from doing our duty; but as long as we know not what the event shall be, we now fetch our encouragement to obey Gods Precept from the precept it self under which we are, and so commit it to the Providence of</HI> G<HI>od with humble submission: as becomes us.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There is a great deal of Hope notwithstan∣ding this uncertainty. Hope is the spring of act∣ion; it is that which thrusts men forward into all their business. Thus it is done in the world, and in the management of all the affairs of this life, men go upon it.</HI> The Husbandman sows in hope; <HI>the Merchant adventures his Estate to manifold perils in hope; there is no assurance in these things; all that they can say, is,</HI> if God
<PB N="251" REF="000581_0256_0FA714FB67729E18"/>
wills it shall prosper; <HI>and they withal observe that this is the way in which the Providence of</HI> G<HI>od is to be served, and unto which he is wont ordinarily to give his blessing. Now there is as good hope here:</HI> G<HI>od is pleased to convert sinners by the use of means; it is the way that he hath appointed for it, it is not therefore im∣possible but that he may give his blessing to our endeavours, and make them to succed; nay, it is very probable, that if he makes us diligent and earnest, he doth intend to give us the desired suc∣cess: the</HI> W<HI>ord of</HI> G<HI>od gives us as much encou∣ragement to this, as to any thing else, and more too.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That if these endeavours do succeed, we are well paid for all our labour. The joy and comfort of it, will give us abundant satisfaction. If we may but save a Soul from going to the pit, if we may but win a sinner over unto Christ, and be instrumental of bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing him in unto him, that he may have service from him we shall never think much of any thing that we have done for the ob∣taining of it: All these <HI>travailing pains</HI> are now forgotten, for the joy that there is one <HI>born</HI> to Christ, who shall serve him here, and live with him for ever. If the honour of <HI>G</HI>od be very dear, and the Souls of sinners very precious to us, this will be our joy. and our triumph both now, and in the <HI>day of Christs</HI> and the very hopes and forethoughts
<PB N="252" REF="000581_0257_0FA714FC5AF9DE58"/>
of it are enough to put life into our endea∣vours.</P>
<P N="6">6. But supposing that we should fail in our desires and hopes on this account, we shall be no losers still. <HI>Our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI> It will indeed be our present grief and bitterness of heart, but we shall not lose our recompense. The rewards which God bestows upon his people, are not according to the success, but according to their integrity and faithful industry. If we pray for the conversion of these or those, &amp; they be not converted, <HI>Our prayers shall re∣turn into our own bosoms,</HI> if we take pains with them and all com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to nothing as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o them, but seems to be as water spilt on the ground, yet <HI>God will not forget our labour of love,</HI> but will remember us in the day of Recompense: with this Christ comforts himself, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P>This may serve to caution us against carnal confidence on the one hand, and despair on the other. This caution concerns all these whose business it is to endeavour the conver∣sion of sinners unto God; these are two dange∣rous rocks that we must carefully steer be∣tween
<PB N="253" REF="000581_0258_0FA714FCED2C6078"/>
if we would keep a right course in this duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Beware of carnbal confidence. Let us not make too large and positive promises to ourselves with respect of our labour: let us not say and conclude, that because we find our hearts to be mightily carried out for the good of them whom we have to do withal, so as to make us unweariedly industrious with them, and to use all manner of endeavours that we are capable of; that therefore they must needs be converted, as if by our own grace or industry we were able to do it in and for them; or as if by our care we had obli∣ged God to a necessity of doing it for us, up∣on our laying ourselves out; this is a carnal conclusion, and it flows from ignorance, and pride, and presumption, and it thereupon offers unto God no little provocation, to withdraw his blessing, and so to disappoint our expectation lest otherwise we should be lifted up with self-applause, and <HI>burn inodnse to our own not,</HI> and so rob him of the honour of his work.</P>
<P N="2">2. And let us avoid despair of doing good▪ what-ever seeming discouragements there may be before us, what though a great deal of the pains which we have taken seems to be lost, and sinners are as far from being fruitful as ever; nay, they grow worse, and more rooted in their wicked courses; what

though we have tried all the ways that we can think of with them, and all seems to do them no good, but rather hurt; yet let not this make us to cast off our endeavours, to despond and to say it is in vain for us to do any thing more, but let us say as <HI>Peter</HI> did to Christ, <HI>Luk.</HI> 5. 5. <HI>we have toiled all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and taken nothing: nevertheless at thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I will let down the net.</HI> We cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the time is past, or that this sin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not be still turned unto <HI>G</HI>od; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, and for ought we know he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> it may be at the next throwing out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> will come into the net, and be ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></P>

<P>This Doctrine tells us that it is no good Rule to judge of mens fidelity by their suc∣cess. It is a thing which is too much practi∣sed among men; but the truth in hand will convince us how not only uncharitable, but also how ungrounded a conclusion it is, for, if men are but instruments in Gods hand, and used by him at his meer pleasure, to do what work he sees meet to do by them, and have no certainty of the efficacy of their endea∣vours; then, for others to say, that because there is not such fruit of their labours as
<PB N="255" REF="000581_0260_0FA714FE662F67E8"/>
were to be desired, therefore they believe no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at all or are not industrious, or sincere in what they do, is a very censorious inference: that, because such a Minister brings name more souls to Christ, than such another doth, therefore this man is not so faithful or so painful as he: because this parent hath to∣wardly &amp; hopeful Children, &amp; that other hath such as are rebellious, and Scandalous, there∣fore he is careless and negligent of them, is a conclusion which the premises will not prove. It is indeed a duty for every man to examine himself; and such events have great motive in them, to put them upon it, the more Solemnly to enquire, if such a Provi∣dence be not a punishment of such a neglect, and if they discover it, to bewail and reform it; but that is must needs be so, is contrary to the evidence of the Doctrine, and a placing of too much upon men.</P>

But if we have no certainty here, then it calls upon us to do these two things in conjuncti∣on.</P>
<P N="1">1. To be faithful in doing what God re∣quires of us. This is our province; we then know our place, and acknowledge it, when we take the command to be our obliga∣tion, and do what we do in Obedience there∣unto: when we remember that we are Gods Servants, and that it is his work which we are employed in, and he will look after it, and carry on his own ends, in and by it: <HI>the love of God must constrain us</HI> in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e things as it did <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 14.

<P N="2">2. To commend our labours unto God, and that, not only by a submitting of them to his Providence, without taking of his work out of his hands, which is one part of this du∣ty; but also by earnest prayer to him, con∣fessing that all our endeavours without him will do nothing; call upon him, and beg hard of him, that he will <HI>confirm our work,</HI> and make <HI>our way prosperous.</HI> If we are uncer∣tain, and all depends upon him; it saith that we should pray over all that we do: pray before, that God would direct and assist us; pray after, that <HI>G</HI>od would bless this Ser∣mon,

<P>IT follows that we consider the <HI>Hypotheses</HI> severally, together with the inferences which the Vine-dresser draws from them. The first thing that he supposeth is, That this fig∣tree, after he hath digged about it and dung∣ed it, may possibly bear, though it were be∣fore barren; and truly, if he had not had some hope of this, he would not have askt liberty to make any farther trial upon it: The inference which he draws from hence is not exprest in the Text, but intended: It is and <HI>Ellyptick</HI> kind of expression, and very fre∣quent in Scripture Dialect; in which there is something left to be supplied: what that is here, is to be gathered from that which is concluded upon the latter <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> for con∣trary suppositions, infer contrary conclusions. Our Translation suitably supplies it with the word, <HI>[well] q. d.</HI> all shall be well; there will then be no occasion to cut it down,
<PB N="262" REF="000581_0267_0FA7150897B872E0"/>
but it will be profitable for it to stand; it will be both honourable and serviceable in the Vineyard; it will not repent thee of this for bearance; nor shall I be sorry for the pains that I shall have taken with it; and it shall be well with that too; the reproach of its barrenness shall cease, and it shall be out of the danger of the threatning.</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. <HI>If after all patience and pains used with them, Barren Souls become fruitful, all shall be well.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though they have been long in Gods Vine∣yard, under the dispensation of Gospel means, and enjoyed all manner of endeavours that have been used with them, have worn out the greatest part of a day of grace, and with∣stood thousands of calls and counsels, doing <HI>G</HI>od no service all this while, but dishonour∣ing him; have <HI>cumbred the ground,</HI> provoked God to anger against them, &amp; stirred him up to proceed to <HI>threaten them with e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting down:</HI> if yet at the last it repents them, and they loath themselves for their sin, and return to him again <HI>with all their heart, and with all their soul,</HI> all shall still be well at the last.</P>
<P>There are three respects in which the Truth of the Doctrine doth discover it self;
<PB N="263" REF="000581_0268_0FA715092A4D25B8"/>
the proposing and clearing of which will suffice for the Explication and Confirmation of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It shall be well with the sinner himself, Though he hath done so much to undo himself, and hath brought himself so near to the brink of Eternal Ruine, and had almost sinned himself beyond hope, yet this shall turn the scale, and re∣cruit him again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There are three things in which this may be discovered.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>His former barrenness shall not be charged upon him. All the guilt of it shall be removed: it was a great height that he was arrived unto; he had been all this while heaping up provocation, and filling a terrible account: but upon his re∣turning to</HI> G<HI>od, all these scores are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost, and his person is justified; his</HI> sins are blotted out as a cloud, <HI>an act of oblivion it past, and his iniquities</HI> shall be remembred no more <HI>against him, Ezek.</HI> 18 21, 22.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>G</HI>od will repent him of the evil which he had threatned him withal. It is true, re∣pentance cannot properly be in God, because it argues something rash, imprudent, incon∣siderate in him that acts it, of which the In∣finitely wise God is incapable: but it is as∣cribed to him on the account of his provi∣dence. God sometimes threatens sinners, and in those threatnings, there is a reserve, in case of their repentance: and then, when
<PB N="264" REF="000581_0269_0FA71509CD3F5B80"/>
the sinner repents, God is said to repent, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> when he revokes the threatning, and doth not put it in execution, hence that <HI>Jer</HI> 18. 8. the meaning of such language is, the sinner is now out of the danger of those judgments; he shall not dy, hence that advice <HI>Zeph,</HI> 2. <HI>begin.</HI> which intends not the eternal purpose of God, but the threatning of the law which was denounced against them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence his estate is now safe. He is put into a state of life and salvation; <HI>he is past from death to life; G</HI>od is atoned to him, and loves him, and accepts of him: he shall abide in the vineyard as long as God sees meet to use him for his service there, and then he shall be transplanted into the King∣dom of Glory: he is numbred among the Children and entituled to the inheritance, he may now say as the Prophet <HI>Isa.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>I will praise thee for thou wast angry with me, but thine anger is turned away.</HI> Now the evidence of this comfortable truth will appear in these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The design of the whole day of grace, is to give sinners an opportunity to repent that they may be saved. That is it in∣deed that makes it a day of grace, because in it men have not only a space, but with it a call to return to God that they may live: it is to invite them to, and afford them the means for it, as long therefore as this day
<PB N="265" REF="000581_0270_0FA7150A91CE9418"/>
lasts, God signifies hereby that he is reconci∣lable to sinners, that he <HI>delights not in their death, but had rather that they should turn and live:</HI> for which reason he calls upon them so to do: it is the <HI>day of their visitation,</HI> in which he holds our before them, <HI>the things of their peace,</HI> and therefore gives them offers that if they do accept of them, they shall have peace.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence the lengthening out of this day is on purpose to continue this opportunity to them: when sinners under the</HI> G<HI>ospel, though they neglect it, and hearken not to the voice of</HI> G<HI>od in it, are yet spared, and the wrath of</HI> G<HI>od doth not fall upon them in its weight, it is to afford them a farther trial; it is to see if it will at last repent them of their sins, and they will be perswaded to return unto God with all their hearts. Thus</HI> G<HI>od interprets his patience exercised towards</HI> Jezebel <HI>her self, and chargeth it upon her as an aggra∣vation of her guilt, that she did not so improve it,</HI> Rev. 2 22. <HI>when the sinner is cut off there is no more room for this, but whilst he is spa∣red, there is a</HI> price <HI>continued</HI> in his hands.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence all the Evangelical Calls that are Ministerially given to the sinner, carry the encouraging promise in them. God stirs up the hearts of his Servants to offer mercy to sinners that have been careless, to invite and excite them to Repentance, and they are to make conditional promises to them, that if
<PB N="266" REF="000581_0271_0FA7150C47D73B90"/>
they do still repent and return▪ God is willing to receive them into his favour. They do not publish these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earms of their own heads, but they do it by Commission; they are <HI>Am∣bassadors,</HI> and they have it in their <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ctions</HI> thus to do, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 12, 13. and the Word of God hath a great many of these, which look this way, and have not other limitations but to the present call, let it be when it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 1, 2. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 7. and that forec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. 21, 22. and the purpose of these is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o remove all doubts out of the minds of such as are ready to be discouraged.</P>
<P N="4">4. The sinner is now brought under the promises which a faithful God cannot sail of performing. The Gospel promises are pro∣pounded unto men upon condition, if that be fulfilled in and by the man. <HI>G</HI>od is under the obligation, his word is past for it; par∣don, and peace, and glory are now the mans by Covenant: and whensoever any are made fruitful Christians, when they bring forth un∣to God according to his will, the condition is fulfilled in them; they are the men of and to whom <HI>G</HI>od hath said that he will do them good. There must be faith and holiness put into the man, before he can bear spiritual fruits, and to them the blessing is assured; and <HI>G</HI>od is as good as his word; it is impos∣sible for him to ly: such a soul therefore must needs be in a safe state, if all the blessings
<PB N="267" REF="000581_0272_0FA7150CF70DEAF8"/>
that are laid up in the promise, and purcha∣sed by the Blood of Christ can make him so.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nay this fruitfulness is a declaration of Gos everlasting love to him. It is an evidence that <HI>G</HI>od hath chosen him in Christ before the foundation of the world. Elect∣ing love is he first grace, on which all the rest de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd: the sinner cannot remove his own barrenness, or impower himself to serve God; if ever he be made fruitful, it is <HI>G</HI>od <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do it in him: he only can take a∣way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> natural unprofitableness of his, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the principle of a new life into him, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> birth is the spirits work; the man is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old under spiritual death till he comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> breathes life into him: and this is done according unto his pleasure; he shews this mercy to whom he will; and the only motive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch he hath before him to do it in time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s because he purposed it from eternity: Now therefore the secret of <HI>G</HI>od breaks into light; and though before none knew of it, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sinner might seem to be without hope; now he comes to know that God had appointed him to be an heir of eternal life before the world was: his condition it there∣fore as lafe as Unchangeable Love can make it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It shall be well also in respect of Gods glory. It shall be no grief to him, he shall never repent that he did spare the sinner, and
<PB N="268" REF="000581_0273_0FA7150DD20F36F8"/>
give him a farther time of trial, but be a∣bundantly satisfied in it; we read <HI>Luk.</HI> 15. 9. <HI>There is joy in heaven: &amp;c.</HI> and there is rea∣son why God should take content in it, be∣cause it will bring him honour; the thing will be to him <HI>for a name, and a praise;</HI> this will appear if we consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That which God peculiarly designs by the Gospel, is the glory of his Grace. It is true, his justice is also greatly illustrated by it, in as much as sinners under it do aggra∣vate their guilt, and bring the more fearful Judgments upon themselves: But the <HI>G</HI>ospel is properly a discovery of Christ in his great work of Redemption, and all this is <HI>for the riches of the glory of his grace, Eph.</HI> 1. 6. and where his grace is exalted, there God is greatly glorified, for he shall be <HI>praised in all his Sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> and his other perfections are magnified in and with this: his Justice in that way wherein he revealed his grace by Christ, and upon his satisfaction; his Holi∣ness, in that he gets him an everlasting name and renown in this way, his power in that he is able to bring about this great salvati∣on; his Wisdom in the contrivance of the way to accomplish it; hence therefore the whole treaty of the Gospel, that is held with Sinners, carries in it a demonstration of this Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a more special and eminent
<PB N="269" REF="000581_0274_0FA7150E342E69E8"/>
degree of glory that redounds to God by this. When a sinner who hath so obstinate∣ly withstood all endeavours that have been used with him; hath been for so many years growing harder and harder, and by all this laying in so much provocation, through the multiplied affronts that he hath offered to God, shall at last be brought over to him, and become <HI>a plant of renown</HI> in his vineyard; here are more illustrious discoveries of his grace in this one: he is a most admirable mo∣nument of mercy. As the mighty power of God is manifested, in the turning of an heart that hath been so long <HI>glewed to his Idols,</HI> so his unchangeable love is here commended: If any thing could have made him to alter his design, so much, and so long continued provocation would have done it; <HI>Paul</HI> there∣fore speaking of himself, who was brought in after he had so long set himself against Christ, speaks of it with admiration, I <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 16.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence all the dishonour that he had be∣fore done unto <HI>G</HI>od, giveth lustre unto this grace. Grace is properly a free favour be∣stowed upon another, which he had not merit of, nor could have challenged to himself of him that bestowed it, had he not done it of his own bounty, it had never been conferred; and there are two special enhaunements of it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the greatness of the favour bestow∣ed,
<PB N="270" REF="000581_0275_0FA7150EE90C5CA0"/>
and the great unworthiness of the Sub∣ject that participates in it: The more there may be said way he should not, the more there must needs appear of the condescen∣dency of him that doth it. Now as it is sin that most of all speaks the unworthiness of men, so the more aggravations there are in it, the farther doth it set the man off from this, and renders him the more unworthy; and there can be nothing that more aggra∣vates sin, than that a man should, under all the offers of mercy, and means of repentance, go on in a course of sin, notwithstanding all the strivings of the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od with him: this therefore is grace indeed: when <HI>Paul</HI> would evalt it, he tells us what he was before it came, I <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 13. <HI>A Blasphemer, a Per∣secuter, and injurious.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And the sinner is now made, not only a monument, but also an instrument of Gods <HI>G</HI>lory. As he before dishonoured him, so now he serves him; he bears fruit, and it is for God, and <HI>he is glorified by it, John</HI> 15. 8. and usually it comes to pass, that though he is born so much out of time, and so hath but a short opportunity allowed him wherein to glorify God in this life, as having spent the greatest part of his time in vanity; yet he is more deeply engaged than ordinary in <HI>G</HI>ods Service, and more strenuously endeavours to make up his lost way, and redeem the little
<PB N="271" REF="000581_0276_0FA7150FAC02B170"/>
spot of time that is allowed him, being quic∣kned thereunto by the thought of his former unprofitableness. What ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did <HI>Paul</HI> make in the work of Christ? <HI>he laboured more than all</HI> the rest of his Fellow Apostles; and tho' he came in after them, yet he <HI>came not behind t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e chief of them,</HI> and this is much to the glory of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. It shall be well in respect of Gods peo∣ple; and those of them more especially who have been the deepest concerned for the sin∣ner, and taken the most pains with him, For,</P>
<P N="1">1. They shall now reap the fruit of all their labours. They were a long time ma∣king of sad complaints, that they had <HI>labour∣ed in vain,</HI> and were ever and anon almost ready to faint and despond, and to corclude, surely there will never any good be done up∣on this sinner, he is even grown altogether hopeless, all our pains have been thrown a∣way upon him: but now their labour ap∣pears not to be lost, because they are brought in unto Christ; and it is a full recompense: although a man be at a great deal of expense, and use long patience about any design that his heart is deeply engaged in, and it be a great while before it comes to take effectu∣ally, yet if at length it be compassed, the man is not frustrated; now they can heartily <HI>glorifie God</HI> in such as these are; <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 23, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>

The desires of their hearts are thus accomplished, and so their <HI>Joy is fulfilled.</HI> The great thing which they longed for, and which carried them forth in all their endea∣vours, for which they chearfully attended all the duty lying on them, was the conversion of sinners; this was it that they waited to see, and cast many an earnest look for the discovery of it: and therefore when they do come to fee it, they cannot but rejoyce, as a mother doth in a child, or a Conqueror that takes great Spoils, it makes them to forget all the labour and toil which they have bin at, and their hearts are comforted in it: all the grief which they were sinking under be∣fore, for fear of the issue, is now turned in∣to joy, to see them brought home to Christ; <HI>their mourning over</HI> those perishing Souls <HI>is turned into a dance.</HI> They are glad on Gods account, that he shall have honour now by such an one, who before did nothing but dishonour him; they rejoyce on the Sinners account, that he shall now obtain salvation, and be happy for ever in the favour of God; and they rejoyce on their own account, to think what comfort they shall have in these in the day of Christ.</P>

<P>For Caution. Let none from hence pre∣sume to delay their returning unto God. There is an evil spirit in men naturally, that leads them to abuse the most precious Truths of the Word of God, and to turn the richest cordials into the most deadly poyson. It may be there are some who hearing this Truth, do thereupon say in their hearts, if it be so, we will then allow our selves a while longer in our sinful courses, we will take a little more pleasure in the <HI>ways of our hearts,</HI> there is no such danger: if at last we bear fruit, we shall do well enough. If there be any that do nourish such an evil <HI>root of bit∣terness</HI> in them. I warn you in the name of God to beware to your selves, left it prove your utter destruction. I am sure such infe∣rences lead to desperate conclusions; and if men once come to settle upon them, their condition is next to hopeless; let me there∣fore urge these two considerations upon such.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though if you do bear fruit there is no danger of your final miscarrying, yet there is great danger whether you shall bear or no; if you were as sure of true Repentance at last, as you may be that <HI>G</HI>od will certainly accept of you, if you do indeed turn to him,
<PB N="274" REF="000581_0279_0FA71515E900DB50"/>
the hazzard would be taken off: but the De∣vil cheats you, by perswading you to draw unwarrantable conclusions from uncertain premises: be then advised to ballance this consideration with these two on the other hand.</P>
<P N="1">1. The God only can work this change in you. If it were in your power there were the more to be pleaded: If the sinner could turn himself when he pleased, he might be the more bold, but converting grace is the <HI>gift of God,</HI> if he doth not work it in you, you can never do it for your selves: you can as easily create a world, as put grace into your own hearts, whereby you may live to Gods glory. Now <HI>G</HI>od offers this grace to you, ne now pleads with you about it, he saith, <HI>to day, if you will hear his voice;</HI> but he hath given you no assurances that he will take your time, or wait your leisure to do this work in and for you.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Gods day of grace is limited. It is true, he hath not told us how long he will lengthen it out to this or that sinner; but in general we are assured that it hath its fixed bounds beyond which it shall not pass, and that it is to some longer, to others shorter, as it pleaseth him: he hath said, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 3. <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive;</HI> and there∣fore hath given that advice to men, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 6. <HI>Seek the Lord while he may be found; call
<PB N="275" REF="000581_0280_0FA715176EDB3958"/>
upon him while he is near;</HI> and this is a solemn consideration; which every unprofitable soul under the Ordinances ought often to enter∣tain his thoughts withal: and particularly in the end of every Sabbath; here is one day more of my season past and gone, I am one Sabbath nearer to the end of my day of grace, which if once it comes to be past, and <HI>G</HI>ods time be over, I am then beyond all hopes of recovery, and there will be no more possibili∣ty for ever of my returning to <HI>G</HI>od: and now say, what comfort can you gather from your presumed supposition, when the Assum∣ption must be, but I am not like to return for ever.</P>

If ever this work do truly pass upon you, it will then bitterly repent you of your delays; however you indulge a carnal mind, and corrupt heart with such presumptions for the present; if once the grace of God comes to be put into▪ you, and you be indeed made fruitful, this will embitter the reflection to your thoughts: Then will you wish that you had come in to God before, complain of your selves, lament all the lost time that cannot be recovered, cry out of your selves for fools and madmen that had such <HI>a price in your hands,</HI> and had so wofully neglected it: then will you see that all your former time was lost time, and say, Oh that I had been wise; how much might I have done for <HI>G</HI>od? what

<P>Let this serve to encourage such as have long lived barren in Gods vineyard. It is no new device or stratagem of Satan, that great enemy of Souls, when he can no longer nou∣rish security in mens hearts, and thereby a∣nimate them in their delaying to entertain the calls of the Gospel; but they begin to have touches upon their hearts and their consciences reflect on them conviction of their sin and danger, and rouse them up to return and fleck after God in earnest, now to lay matter of discouragement before them, and drive them off from repentance, by per∣swading them that there is now no hope for them, it is too late, they have sinned beyond a pardon, such sinners as they have nothing now to expect but ruine, there is no mercy to be expected from <HI>G</HI>od by them: and
<PB N="277" REF="000581_0282_0FA71518AF39533"/>
thus from presumption he would precipitate them into desperation. This doctrine in hand, will speak a word of hope to any such, and help their sinking Souls with some thing to catch hold upon to support them, and to answer all their doubts and fears, which Satan and a misgiving heart are ready to oppress them withal; and there are these considerations which will stop the mouth of them all.</P>
<P N="1">1. That if God were not willing to accept of you returning to him, he would not conti∣nue to call you. You say, I am afraid that if I should seek unto God he will not accept of me; but every new call that is offered to you is a contradiction, to such a suspici∣on: What Gods servants speak to you in his name, and according to his word, that he saith, now they say to you in his name, if af∣ter all you will hearken to his invitation, and yield yourselves up to him <HI>you shall live, and not dye.</HI> And they have his warrant so to say; they recieved a command to make such a Proclamation unto you. God doth not dissemble with you if he saith <HI>return and</HI> they that do so shall live: if he incites you to come and you do come <HI>he will in no wise cast you out.</HI> He is in earnest; <HI>be never said to the house of Jacob, seek me in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That if your hearts do eneline to ac∣cept of his call, it is his spirit that hath done
<PB N="278" REF="000581_0283_0FA715196BDF6648"/>
this in and for you. It therefore is an evi∣dence that his day is not done; for as long as <HI>G</HI>od strives with sinners, their day is not over. Your natural inclination was to have withstood all calls and counsels for ever: it is a great work that is wrought by God in the Soul, when it is turned so as to be willing that he should do the work for it, and to desire that he would do it. If your barren∣ness be your burden, and you are made to groan under it, and long to be delivered from it, it takes off all reason of doubting whether God be willing or no: for it practi∣cally saith in you, that he doth desire it, and gives you reason to believe that he is doing it for you, how else came you by this?</P>
<P N="3">3. That there is merit enough in the sa∣tisfaction of Christ to answer for all your sins and provocations. Though you have heightned them by your contumacy and long resistance of God; yet Justice is fully atoned, there is a compleat payment made to it by the blood of Christ, and therefore read, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 31. yea and by the accepting and pardo∣ning of such an one as you are, there will be abundant evidence of the great extent of the vertue of these merits of his: it will appear to the glory of Christ, how wonderous a Saviour he is, what a treasure there is laid up in his satisfaction; and therein will God also be glorified.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="279" REF="000581_0284_0FA7151A43656E38"/>
4. That God, Angels, and good men, will greatly rejoyce at this: How glad was the <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> that his son was <HI>re∣turned</HI> after his profuseness? W<HI>hat joy is there in Heaven at the conversion of a lost Sinner?</HI> and how much are the hearts of Gods People re∣freshed, when they see one that hath been a long time dishonouring of God, by bringing forth the <HI>works of darkness,</HI> now to honour him, by bearing the fruits of Repentance? and the way for you to farther this joy is to make haste, and use no more delays; now to come over to Christ, and seek his grace. There are none that will be grieved at it; but Devils and Ungodly Men, and the more they are enraged the better. Be not then discou∣raged, <HI>though you have done all this wickedness,</HI> yet at the last give your selves up in an ever∣lasting Covenant, to God, and bring forth the holy fruits of true Obedience unto him; and so shall your Repentance be unrepentable.</P>

Hence,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. <HI>If sinners continue unfruitful after utmost endea∣vours used with them, they shall perish without remedy, without pity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though if they bear fruit at the last, they shall be spared, yet if finally they will not be brought unto it, but remain in their na∣tural barrenness, they must perish in the end: though God hath spared them once and again as being loth that they should dy, yet he will then spare them no more.</P>
<P>There are three things intimated, as con∣tained in the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="282" REF="000581_0287_0FA7152030D83A08"/>
1. That <HI>G</HI>od will certainly bring destru∣ction upon them in the end. There shall be no escaping for them: all the patience with which he hath waited upon them, and good will which he hath shewn unto them, loving and kind entreaties which he hath urged up∣on them, will not secure them from his wrath, or be any evidence to them that he will save and not destroy them: sinners are ready to say so; but God would have them to know and be assured of the contrary, <HI>Psal</HI> 50. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 22.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That their Church-priviledges will not save them. Many are ready to think that the</HI> Sanctuary <HI>shall shelter them, whatever they be, how obstinately soever they refuse to hearken to the voice of</HI> G<HI>od, yet the Temple shall save them; they are in the vineyard, and no evil can come at them; this was the carnal confidence of these Jews, which our Saviour Christ would put them from entertaining, and bring them to see that impenitence would break an hole in the wall, and open a way for wrath to come upon them, and all they could challenge could not secure them, and see</HI> Jer. 9. 25, 26.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when it comes to this, they shall then have none to plead for them. That a sinner under the <HI>G</HI>ospel may sin himself our of all pity, and beyond the prayers of the Godly: they may go on so far in their ob∣stinacy, that even they who have been most
<PB N="283" REF="000581_0288_0FA71521283B6870"/>
sollicitous for them, and have many a time with tears begged of God, to spare and for∣bear them, shall have done on this account, leave off praying for them, and stand in the gap between an angry God and them no lon∣ger: and now the way to Gods wrath stands open, and there will be none to obstruct it; none to stay his hand or keep him back from vengeance; the hearts that before melted for them, shall now be hardned against them, and they shall readily comply with, and re∣joyce in the Judgments of God that shall fall upon them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 52. 5, 6.</P>
<P><HI>This is a solemn Truth, and many sinners are hard of believing it▪ having taken up strong perswasions about the mercy of God, as if it were inconsistent with that thus to do by them: But the Word of God is full of conviction on this account, enough to take off such vain opinions from mens minds if they will believe that.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Doctrine may be cleared and confirmed in these conclusions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That God can be highly provoked with sinners in the visible Church. Indeed he is no where so incensed against any sinners as those that sin there: all that belong thither are not such as he hath set his heart upon: he hates sin wherever he sees it; his pure eyes cannot behold it without detestation, and it is most grievous to him where he hath u∣sed the most of means to draw men from it,
<PB N="284" REF="000581_0289_0FA71521ADB08880"/>
and where he expects holiness. The Church is a company of holy ones, by seperation for God, by profession, and by external denomi∣nation; Holiness is that which God calls for, and they are devoted unto: if therefore they be otherwise, he must needs take it in ill part, and it must stir up his jualousy against them. The Scripture affords us many in∣stances of Gods anger that hath been stirred against such as have been taken near unto him, and born the name of his people upon them, how often was God angry with Israel in the Wilderness, and in the land of Cana∣an? how many ways did he take to testify his displeasure against them? hence that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 11. 15. W<HI>hat hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many,</HI> if men in covenant with God, will live in sin, he will not bear it, nay the very Covenant threatning is out against them? and that is a witness of his Displea∣sure.</P>
<P N="2">2. That nothing is more provoking to God than for these to persist in wickedness; notwithstanding all means possible used to reclaim them. Although all sin be provo∣king to him, yet obstinacy and unreclaimable∣ness in it renders them that commit it most of all displeasing in his sight: and this is aggra∣vated proportionally to the means that have been used with them; and that is accumu∣lated,
<PB N="285" REF="000581_0290_0FA7152269FFF7E8"/>
when these have been carried on after signal tokens of his anger and eminent deli∣verances out of his hand, and renewed endea∣vours with fresh and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reased importunity urged upon them Though men sin, yet if they will be reclaimed, by afflictions, by deliveran∣ces, by earnest calls and entreaties, <HI>G</HI>od can readily pass by all this provocation, and be atoned to the sinner; but if he harden his heart under all this, and goes on still in his loose and sinful ways, not giving ear to the voice of God: if he remains unchanged, im∣penitent, and in his natural state; this carri∣eth the greatest offence in it; this is the com∣plaint of Christ, <HI>Math.</HI> 23. 37. <HI>How oft would I have gathered thy children, but ye would not.</HI> This was it that made Gods anger to burn so ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly against Jerusalem, 2. <HI>Chro.</HI> 36, 15: 16. This is his very quarrel with them, <HI>Amos.</HI> 4. 6. <HI>Yet have ye no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> returned to me saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That there are fearful threatnings out against the finally impenitent. The truth is, all the terrible menaces of the Word of <HI>G</HI>od are most properly belonging to such as these. It is not this or that sin in it self, that holds the sinner bound under the curse; for, let it have been what it will, of what sort or degree soever, yet if men do truly repent of it, that will turn away the wrath of God, and take off the threatning from
<PB N="286" REF="000581_0291_0FA71523276FAC30"/>
them: but it is impenitency added to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that continues a man under the curse, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>rance in it, that makes his case to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>less. When <HI>G</HI>od sent his Prophets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most fearful denunciations of wrath, they were still to add invitations to repen∣tance, and make encouraging promises of mercy in case they did prevail: but they were withal to assure them, that if they did not return those Judgments should take place upon them without avoidance; <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 19, 29. <HI>Psal.</HI> 7. 10, 11. This is it which makes <HI>inquity to be their ruine.</HI> If they had <HI>hearken∣ed to the voice of God, believed his word,</HI> and obeyed his counsels, <HI>he would have turned his hand upon their enemies,</HI> and faved them; but because they would not so do, therefore did his wrath fall upon them.</P>
<P N="4">4. That God hath sixt a time how long he will wait for the sinners conversion, be∣fore he puts these threatnings of his in exe∣cution. God is pleased first to threaten be∣fore he strikes the blow: and because this is one of the courses which he useth with men to perswade them to return, he gives them time afterwards, and calls aloud to them to consider and amend: Now this is Gods long sufferance; and the duration of it depends upon his meer pleasure. But though we cannot tell how long it shall be, yet he knows for he hath appointed it in his holy purpose;
<PB N="287" REF="000581_0292_0FA715258C72FB30"/>
he tells how long the old world shall be wait∣ed on, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 3. thus long he will tarry no longer: he hath set every sinner a day, and his call is limited unto it: it saith, <HI>to day, while it is called to day: i. e.</HI> whilst it is a day of grace and patience; and because it is a day, it therefore hath its bounds, and will have an end; it will not continue always: God can bear a great while, but he will not do so for ever: he can, as patient as he is, <HI>be weary with forbearing,</HI> and he will so be when that day is run out.</P>
<P N="5">5. That if the sinner withstands Gods time, he will unavoidably bring these threat∣nings upon his own head. Though Gods menaces be conditional, yet they are real: he never intended them meerly for the af∣frighting of man, but is resolved that they shall take place according to the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> port of them. He faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ner repents <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so saith, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whilst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shall be no longer than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and when the day of patience is at an end,
<PB N="288" REF="000581_0293_0FA71528ABE3CB48"/>
the day of vengeance will tread upon the heels of it, and shall have no mercy in it, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27. 11. <HI>He that made them will have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o mercy on them, and be that formed them, will shew them no favour.</HI> So. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 7: 2: 3. 4. This is a day of revenges, and God will then make all his words good, and sinners experience shall throughly convince them, that he did not speak in jest, though before they laughed at all forewarnings, and seemed to desire the day of the Lord.</P>
<P N="6">6. That Gods holiness and justice do stand engaged for the sinners destruction. It must therefore needs be: this renders it unavoid∣able. Sinners please themselves with dreams of mercy, as if there were no other Attribute in God but that, concerned about them: but know it, that if ever any sinner be saved, <HI>mercy and truth must meet together, righteousness and peace must kiss each other.</HI> Final Barren∣ness cut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off the man from saving mercy, because Holiness and Justice do forbid it. Holiness, is God bound for his own Glory, so as not to bear any thing that stands in the way of it; now as it is Gods glory to for∣give the penitent, so it would be a wrong to it to spare the obstinate; he would lose the glory of his Truth in his threatnings, yea the glory of his having honour by the creature that will pay him none. Justice also stands in the way; for every sinner is
<PB N="289" REF="000581_0294_0FA71529E291F5D8"/>
devoted to destruction by the Law-threat∣ning, to which the Justice of God stands ob∣liged; there is but one way to salve this Justice in the justifying of a sinner, and that is by the imputation of the Righteousness of Christ to him, which must be according to the condition of the New-Covenant, which the sinner by his obstinacy keeps himself from, and therefore hath no claim to the priviledges of it; and so he must needs pe∣rish.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That gracious Souls desire the sinners sal∣vation only in Gods way. It is true, every sanc∣tified soul hath a love to the souls of others, and earnestly desires that they may be saved▪ and is willing to do all that he can for the procuring of it: but yet grace hath taught every one that tru∣ly fears God, to subordinate all his aims, ends, desires to the glory of God, which is the ultimate end that all ought to propound to themselves in every thing. These desires are therefore limited, as to the way for the accomplishment of them, he would have the sinner to be saved, but he would not have him to be faved in his sins, for that would bring dishonour to God, but he would have him to be converted and changed, sanctifi∣ed and made fruitful, and so to be saved; be∣cause this is the only way in which God brings men to salvation, so as to be glorified in it: and for this end it is that he doth so much labour for his conversion, and pray so earnestly unto God,
<PB N="290" REF="000581_0295_0FA71529F2321130"/>
that he would change his heart: how often is</HI> Paul <HI>begging for grace in behalf of those whom he writes unto?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That these, if they find their last essays frustrated, are apt to grow discouraged. There is indeed too much pronitude in the hearts of <HI>G</HI>ods people to sink under discou∣ragement when they ought not, and they are fain to labour with their own misgiving spirits to animate them: but it is of God many times, and yet very righteously, and in anger to sinners, to take away all hopes from his Servants: and though he doth not say in so many words, as he did to the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah, pray no more for them, for I will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hear thee,</HI> yet he sometimes provi∣dentially stops their mouths, and they look upon such as beyond their hope, and there∣upon all their endeavours with and for them begin to grow languid and faint.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>And when it comes to this, there is now no∣thing to hold back Gods hand of revenge from falling upon such sinners. Whilst these</HI> stood in the gap, <HI>they kept off the Judgments of</HI> G<HI>od, at least from cutting down and rooting out those sinners; whilst they were earnest with</HI> G<HI>od to spare and try them, his hands were held back, and he knew not how to destroy them: but now
<PB N="291" REF="000581_0296_0FA7152AA7B67160"/>
God hath, by silencing of them,</HI> made a way to his Wrath, <HI>the breach stands wide open, and</HI> there is nothing in view but ruine, ready to fall upon sinners; all means having been tri∣ed to the utmost, and nothing remaining un∣essayed, all patience having been vilely abu∣sed and trampled upon, all hopes are now quite gone, and what shall <HI>G</HI>od do with them now but cut them down?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>For Information in three particulars;</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. This Doctrine certifies us that gracious souls will be satisfied in the Judgments which God will execute upon impenitent sinners: There will be so much of equity in Gods proceedings against them, so much inexcusa∣bleness in them, who have had so great pati∣ence, and so many endeavours afforded unto them, that they will have nothing at all to object against it: and indeed though it cannot but grieve the souls of Gods children at pre∣sent, to see how wilfully unreclaimable sinners dy, yet they cannot but justifie God in his righteous Judgments upon them. The vine-dresser cannot but say, his Lord may well cut down such a fig-tree, as no means will make
<PB N="292" REF="000581_0297_0FA7152B6DA35D68"/>
to bear fruit. How much more then shall they for ever acquiesce in the final doom that shall be past in the great day, when their grace shall be perfect, and Gods Righteous∣ness shall be openly declared? and it ought to be an awful consideration for sinners to think of, that if you now <HI>will dy,</HI> you shall have no pity then, but all the Redeemed of Christ will, in that day, <HI>Rejoyce in the Judgment.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>G</HI>od will be no loser by all the long-suffering which he extends unto men, though they are not made better by it. This is the force of this plea: It can be but cut down at last, and that will be a sufficient de∣claration of righteous revenge; and this tells us, that <HI>G</HI>od both can and will proportion the miseries of ungodly men, to the cost that hath been laid out upon, and despised by them; which may convince all unregene∣rate sinners under the Gospel, upon what an awful account they stand, and are spared from time to time, if they shall at the last miss of eternal life.</P>
<P N="3">3. This then shews us the desperate mad∣ness of secure sinners, that have been let a∣lone after threatnings; and how many such are there among us, who have been under
<PB N="293" REF="000581_0298_0FA7152C287CDE40"/>
the sentence of destruction; Gods hand hath been up, ready to fall upon them, but it hath been held back, the Judgment was stayed, and they escaped: they now say with <HI>Agag, The bitterness of death is past:</HI> and hereupon they grew more secure, and careless of them∣selves, and unmindful o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great concerns of their souls than ever; they forget their promises, and abide contentedly in their former unfruitfulness, as if <HI>they had been de∣livered to do all these abominations!</HI> Is this the improvement which you make of a time of trial? <HI>Oh foolish and unwise!</HI> and do you think thus to escape the wrath of God?

The difference is vastly great, <HI>if you bear fruit well, but if not,</HI> you see what is your doom: and doth not this call for your refle∣ction upon this? doth it not say, that it in∣finitely concerns you to know what improve∣ment you have made of this mercy of God that hath spared you? will it not be a fear∣ful thing to be mistaken here? and that you may be guided aright in this self-examinati∣on, take diligent notice of the condition ex∣pressed in the <HI>Text;</HI> it doth not say if you grow worse, and fall into grosser abominati∣ons than before you indulged your selves in; if you grow more lewd, and more debauch∣ed; which yet it is to be feared, is the wo∣ful effect of sparing mercies upon too many unhappy creatures, whom their deliverances have emboldened in sin; but <HI>if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>:</HI> If the Judgment found you unconverted, and leaves you unconverted, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> about your conversion, this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to bring you under the sentence, whatsoever re∣formation it may work in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣versation, however you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from some sins which you formerly lived in, and do some duties which heretofore you lived in the neglect of, yet if there be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a through change wrought in you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not effectually brought home to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is still a truth as to you, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P>Let it be for a loud call to barren souls in the vineyard, at last to bear fruit, and to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aste so to do: It is God only who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> word powerful, and work that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but yet there is a cal∣ling of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by Gospel invitati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and this Truth speaks very loudly to all those that have been a great while un∣profitable, and on whom uncountable means of grace have seemed to have been thrown away; who have been wearying out of a great deal of Gods forbearance; and yet he affords them one season more, one opportunity lon∣ger;
<PB N="297" REF="000581_0302_0FA7146F65F210C8"/>
let this Doctrine awaken you to a di∣ligent improving of it, to be no longer bar∣ren; <HI>let the time past suffice you,</HI> to have liv∣ed in sin and vanity: as you would escape this fearful destruction, use all possible en∣deavours, and go to God in Christs Name with the greatest importunity begging of him that he will make you fruitful: and that I may press this Exhortation upon you forci∣bly, let me offer these things to your seri∣ous consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. Think how long you have already re∣sisted the Spirit of God. Although he hath not told sinners how long he will tarry waiting upon them; yet he hath said that it shall not be always, and that is enough to put upon you thoughtfulness: it is good to compute the time that you have had, and is past by you, so many years forbearance, so many strivings with your Souls in them, so often addresses made to you with the tenders of his Grace; all this saith unto the sinner, that his day is wearing up apace, and that it will not be long ere it be spent. And there is reason also to fear, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of means <HI>have</HI> bin used with you, and the more earnest per∣swasions have been pressed upon you, the shorter time you are like to have; because such urgent strivings and importunities, are
<PB N="298" REF="000581_0303_0FA7147029FA6620"/>
a declaration that God is in haste.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Think what an Holy God you have to do withal. Never cheat your selves into a vain opinion, that because he is a merciful God, therefore you shall do well enough with him; how may thousands are there now rue∣ing that fully in the place of Torments? you are in all these transactions concerned with a God who will not always be trifled with; and who will not suffer sinners to tread upon his honour, or cast contempt upon his glory, with∣out calling of them to a severe account for it, and making them to feel▪ the smart of it: if therefore you will not serve him, he will ho∣nour himself upon you; but how little will that be to your comfort.</HI></P>
<P>Hence;</P>
<P N="3">3. Affect your hearts by thinking how fearful this destruction must needs be. How dismal a thing it will be for you, after all this to fall into the hands of revenging jus∣tice. Think, if I bear no fruit, I must needs be destroyed at last, and will not all these things be then remembred against me? and how much better would it then have been, if I had been cut of by such a streak that fell up∣on me, and I was endangered by? had I not
<PB N="299" REF="000581_0304_0FA71470A9C16078"/>
better have perished so many years ago, than to have been let alive to fill up so much more wrath, and lay in so many heavier aggravations of guilt, to make my woes of much the more intollerable.</P>
<P N="4">4. Know it that if now at last you will hearken to the voice of God, and accept of his grace to make you fruitful, all shall be well still▪ if yet before your feet stumble up∣on the dark mountains, you will give glory to God, you may escape this fearful sen∣tence. This very last threatning which I am now urging upon you, it sent to you in mer∣cy, and I am commaded to tell you of it before it comes to pass; that so you may have, at least, one more advantage presented before you to escape it: and oh let it not be despised if you neglected the last sabbaths encourage∣ment, yet if you will entertain this sabbaths terror, and be peswaded to repent and return to God, it is not yet too late for you to escape the curse, and obtain the blessing.</P>
<P N="5">5. Think this may be the last call that e∣very shall be sent unto you, there will be a last I am sure to every impenitent sinner, and it is not improbable but this may be so to some or other on whom it is now urged; There have past very few Sabbath of late, in which
<PB N="300" REF="000581_0305_0FA71475D0FD0790"/>
some have not come to the House of God to hear their last: what need have you then to take heed what entertainment you give here∣unto, you are figtrees in the vineyard you have had many a three years liberty of it, God hath sought fruit of you, and found none, he hath bin greatly provoked hereby and brought many Judgments in the midst of you, and yet hath by the importunity of his servants been prevailed with to deferr &amp; tarry a little <HI>longer;</HI> but he tells you he is in hast, his word saith so, his providence saith so, oh do not then loyter any longer, the matter is of infinite concern∣ment, &amp; it will in a few days more be determi∣ned, you have the choice now before you, and you must make it speedily: either <HI>conversion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> destruction,</HI> and the Lord make you wise in it, for yet a little while, and according as your choice is, so must it be with you through all eternity:</P>
