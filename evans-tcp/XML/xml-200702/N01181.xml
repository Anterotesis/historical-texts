<P>THE <HI>Greatest,</HI> the <HI>Noblest</HI> Work, that ever is done among the Chil∣dren of Men, is this Day to be done in this Assembly. The very <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven, fly to the <HI>Win∣dows</HI> of Heaven, that they may be the <HI>Glad Spectators</HI> of Such a WORK done among the Children of Men upon Earth. It is, <HI>To E∣rect a</HI> TEMPLE <HI>of God.</HI> And what? An <HI>American Wilderness</HI> be the Place, where the Glorious LORD shall See <HI>Temples</HI> Erected for Him! O Sovereign GRACE! O Won∣derful
<PB N="2" REF="001408_0003_0FB2FB231E22EB88"/>
GRACE! <HI>It is even so, Lord, because it Pleases thee</HI>!</P>
<P>Indeed, the Whole CHURCH of GOD, collectively taken, is a TEMPLE, which our <HI>Magnificent Solomon</HI> is Building for Him. The <HI>Building</HI> is not yet Finished. The Pe∣riod which answers to the <HI>Seventh Year,</HI> wherein the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI> was finished, is not yet arrived. When it is arrived, the <HI>Acclamations</HI> [and <HI>Solomons</HI> too among the rest!] will be such as no Age ever yet heard: they will be <HI>Astonishments,</HI> beyond all that were ever yet seen in the World. In the mean time, we are told; <HI>All the Building fitly framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Temple</HI> is <HI>Growing,</HI> in the Con∣version of Sinners unto GOD; and the <HI>Ad∣dition to the Church daily of those that shall be Saved.</HI> When a Sinner is Converted, a New <HI>Stone</HI> is brought and laid in the <HI>Building</HI> of the <HI>Temple.</HI> The <HI>Temple</HI> grows bigger and higher, as often as any Sinner is Converted. God fetches in <HI>Matter</HI> for His <HI>Church,</HI> from all Corners of the World. He will go on doing so, till all the <HI>Elect</HI> are <HI>Effectually Called.</HI> The <HI>Top-stone</HI> of the Church will not be laid, until the Last of the <HI>Elect</HI> be called home to God, that ever shall be so. What a <HI>Shout</HI> will be given upon that Stroke, <HI>It is Finished! It is Finished</HI>! Until this be done, this is the Reason why we are so earnest with our Hearers, to Repent of <HI>Sin,</HI> and Return to
<PB N="3" REF="001408_0004_0FB2FB2643A3EE38"/>
<HI>God,</HI> and Believe on <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Lay Hold on Eternal Life.</HI> The Ministers of the Gospel are <HI>Workmen</HI> about the <HI>Temple.</HI> Their only <HI>Work</HI> in the World should be, to build the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. For this we are in conti∣nual Agony. Oh▪ That this Consideration might prevail with our Hearers, to become <HI>Seriously Religious.</HI>
<Q><HI>Children</HI>; At the Mo∣ment that you do indeed Resolve to become <HI>Seriously Religious,</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, re∣ceives a desireable <HI>Growth</HI> by your Accession unto it. You will contribute unto the <HI>Growth</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> in the Day that you turn unto God. Oh! Happy Souls, that are <HI>Stones</HI> in the <HI>Temple</HI> of the Lord! Oh! Glorious Happiness, to be a <HI>Part</HI> of such a <HI>Temple</HI>! GOD will own you for <HI>His,</HI> in the <HI>Day when He makes up His Jewels.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But there is another Observation, unto which we are now to be invited. As the <HI>Ʋniversal Church</HI> is the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, So E∣very <HI>Particular Church</HI> is to be a <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>Three</HI> Things of High Ac∣count, among the Ancient People of GOD; The <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; The <HI>Family</HI> of <HI>David</HI>; And, the <HI>Temple</HI> of the LORD. In the CHURCH of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, there is a bright <HI>Constellation</HI> of all those Glories meeting together. That CHURCH, which is the Body of them, that <HI>Love the Lord, and Hate Evil,</HI> and hope for Blessedness in the Heavenly World. Our
<PB N="4" REF="001408_0005_0FB2FB27A8487830"/>
Apostle assures us, That this <HI>Church,</HI> is, The <HI>City of God</HI>; and▪ The <HI>Family of God</HI>; and, The <HI>Temple of God.</HI> And, Oh! who would not give himself up unto the Conduct of a Glorious CHRIST, that he may be brought into a <HI>Church</HI> of so great a Character!</P>
<P>Now, the Apostle having said, That the <HI>Ʋniversal Church</HI> is the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, pre∣sently sayes to the Church of <HI>Ephesus; You also are builded together.</HI> The <HI>Particular Church</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI>; the <HI>Congregational Church,</HI> was also a <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>I may then, without any Obstruction in the way, pass on to this <HI>Doctrine and Admoni∣tion of the Lord.</HI></P>
<Q>Every Particular <HI>CHURCH</HI> of the Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> is to be together Built in the Glo∣rious <HI>LORD,</HI> as a <HI>TEMPLE</HI> of <HI>GOD.</HI></Q>
<P>A <HI>Particular Church,</HI> is, A Society of Christians▪ combining for the Worship of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in the ways that He has Instituted. Or, as our <HI>Catechised Children</HI> can tell us; 'Tis <HI>a Congregation of Saints joyned together in the Bond of the Covenant, to Worship the Lord, and Edify One another, in all His Holy Ordinances.</HI> I make no Scruple, to call it, <HI>A Congregational Church.</HI> For it is un∣questionable, That a <HI>Congregational Church</HI> is an <HI>Instituted Church.</HI> If a <HI>Church</HI> of another
<PB N="5" REF="001408_0006_0FB2FB2927CA7E30"/>
Form, should pretend unto Institution, still 'tis the <HI>Congregational Church,</HI> that has the <HI>First</HI> claim, and a <HI>Plain</HI> claim it has, unto it. The <HI>Churches</HI> mention'd in the New Testament, were every One of them, evidently <HI>Congrega∣tional.</HI> And the most Judicious, Laborious and Impartial Searches into Christian Anti∣quity, do declare, That they can't find any other <HI>Churches,</HI> in the First Ages of Christia∣nity, but what were <HI>Congregational.</HI> This Truth will most certainly gain, as Ignorance, and Prejudice, and Passion, in the Treating of such matters, does abate in the World. Concerning such a <HI>Particular Church,</HI> we are now to receive divers <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Unto what may a CHURCH of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, be likened? Unto what, so well as unto an <HI>House,</HI> unto which our Lord JESUS CHRIST Himself has likened it. You shall find this comparison asserted; 1. Tim. 3.15. <HI>The House of God, which is the Church of the Living God.</HI> In ma∣ny Articles <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Comparison be carried on; we will with <HI>Delight</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> Reflect upon several of them.</P>
<P>Has not an <HI>House,</HI> a <HI>Builder</HI>? A <HI>Church</HI> has One. And 'tis the Lord Himself, that is the <HI>Builder</HI> of it. We read, Heb. 3.4. <HI>Every House is built by Some Man; but he that built all things</HI> (here) <HI>is God.</HI></P>
<P>Has not an <HI>House,</HI> an <HI>Owner</HI>? A <HI>Church</HI> has
<PB N="6" REF="001408_0007_0FB2FB2AA2A98130"/>
One. And it is the Lord JESUS CHRIST Himself that is the <HI>Owner</HI> of it. We read, Heb 3 6 <HI>Christ is a Son over His own House, whose House we are.</HI></P>
<P>Is there not <HI>Skill</HI> required unto the Buil∣ding of an <HI>House</HI>? An <HI>Architect</HI> should be an <HI>Artist.</HI> It is no little <HI>Skill,</HI> that is requisite unto the producing of a <HI>Church,</HI> the Ordering of it, and the Managing of it. It calls for the greatest <HI>Skill</HI> in the World. We read, 1 Cor. 3.10▪ <HI>A Wise Master-builder,</HI> must be con∣cerned.</P>
<P>Does an <HI>House</HI> consist of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Choice Materials</HI>? A <HI>Church</HI> must not consist of what is <HI>Rotten</HI>; But of <HI>Saints,</HI> that are Styled <HI>Cedars</HI>; and, <HI>Comparable to find Gold.</HI> Nothing but what is <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Choice,</HI> is to be Admitted here; Except we would make a <HI>Vile Cottage</HI> of it. We read, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.1. They must be, <HI>Saints, and Faithful in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Must the <HI>Materials</HI> of an <HI>House</HI> be well <HI>Prepared,</HI> that they may be laid into it? They that are laid in the <HI>Church,</HI> must be fetch'd out of the <HI>Rude Heap</HI> of Mankind▪ and form'd and hew'd and Squar'd and <HI>Shap'd</HI> for a <HI>Place</HI> among <HI>them that are Sanctified.</HI> A Work of <HI>Effectual Calling,</HI> and <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and <HI>Sancti∣fication,</HI> is to pass upon them, to prepare them for it. We read, 1. Pet. 2.5. <HI>As lively Stones,</HI> (not such <HI>Lifeless</HI> Things, as the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, was composed of,) <HI>ye are built up, a Spiritual House; an Holy Priest-hood.</HI> [Probably <HI>Peter</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001408_0008_0FB2FB31AD5CAFA8"/>
now had in his Eye the words, which our Saviour had formerly Spoken unto him, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16 18.]</P>
<P>Must the <HI>Materials</HI> of an <HI>House,</HI> be well <HI>Joyned</HI> unto One another? It will never be an <HI>House,</HI> if they be not so. The <HI>Form</HI> of it, arises from the <HI>Conjunction</HI> of the <HI>Materials.</HI> In the <HI>Church</HI> there is a <HI>Conjunction</HI> of those, of whom it is made up. Their <HI>Conjunction</HI> is by a <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. In some sort or other, they do Resolve and Engage together to Serve the Lord. We read; Psal. 122 3. <HI>It is compact together.</HI></P>
<P>What is the <HI>End</HI> of an <HI>House</HI>? 'Tis to <HI>Dwell</HI> in; 'Tis a <HI>Dwelling-place.</HI> A <HI>Church</HI> is the Lords <HI>Dwelling-place.</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Habitation of God.</HI> We read, Rev 2 1▪ <HI>He walks there.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; In an <HI>House</HI> there are various <HI>Vessels</HI> and <HI>Ʋtinsels</HI> And in a <HI>Church</HI> there are so too. We read, 2 Tim 2 20. <HI>In a great House, there are not only Vessels of Gold and of Silver, but also of Wood▪ and of Earth; and some to Honour, some to Dishonour.</HI> Godly and Sincere Persons in a <HI>Church,</HI> these are <HI>Vessels of Honour▪ Golden Vessels</HI>▪ or, The <HI>Plate</HI> of the House. Wicked Persons, and the men of <HI>this World,</HI> are <HI>Vessels of Earth.</HI> Such as <HI>Disho∣nour</HI> God by Sin are <HI>Vessels of Dishonour</HI> God Save us from coming under such a Denomi∣nation▪</P>
<P>But, if a <HI>Church</HI> be an <HI>House</HI>▪ I Suppose it will put us in mind. That <HI>Church Work</HI> is
<PB N="8" REF="001408_0009_0FB2FB32E73CAD80"/>
<HI>Building-Work.</HI> I do not wonder then, that <HI>Church-Work</HI> does go on with <HI>Difficulty</HI>; Or, that it goes on with <HI>Deliberation</HI>; Or, that it is <HI>Expensive</HI> to carry it on. To <HI>Build</HI> such an <HI>House,</HI> must needs be an <HI>Hard</HI> Work, a <HI>Slow</HI> Work, and a <HI>Costly</HI> One.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> But what kind of an <HI>House,</HI> is a <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST? It is an <HI>House</HI> that may be called, A <HI>Temple.</HI> Do but say, Who's <HI>House</HI> it is, and you presently deter∣mine it, <HI>A Temple.</HI> It is an <HI>House</HI> of GOD. Hence we read; 2 Cor. 6 16. <HI>Ye are the Tem∣ple of the Living GOD.</HI></P>
<P>In affirming a <HI>Church</HI> to be a TEMPLE, there are Two very Important Things af∣firm'd concerning a <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>First▪ It is to be Remembred, That a <HI>Church,</HI> is like a <HI>Temple, <HI>Dedicated</HI></HI> and <HI>Con∣secrated</HI> unto the <HI>Special Service</HI> of GOD. What is a <HI>Temple</HI>? 'Tis an <HI>House Dedicated</HI> unto the Worship of GOD. What is a CHURCH? 'Tis a Company of Men, who have <HI>Dedicated themselves</HI> unto the Worship of GOD. GOD &amp; the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is Worshipped in the <HI>Church.</HI> The very <HI>De∣sign</HI> upon which a <HI>Church</HI> is Erected, is, That the Lord might be Worshipped there. A CHURCH is, as we read, 1 Cor. 1 2. <HI>To call upon the Name of JESƲS CHRIST▪ our Lord.</HI> The Lord JESUS CHRIST affords unto men in His Church, peculiar Opportu∣nities
<PB N="9" REF="001408_0010_0FB2FB34790CC838"/>
of Communion with Himself. A <HI>Church</HI> is gathered upon this Intention; That Men may therein Enjoy a <HI>Special Com∣munion</HI> with GOD, and the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Language, the Pretence, the very <HI>Motto</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI>▪ is that; 1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>Truly our Fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.</HI> In a <HI>Church,</HI> the Children of Men present their <HI>Offerings</HI> unto GOD; and in a <HI>Church,</HI> GOD Visits the Children of Men, with <HI>Communications</HI> of Light and Life and Grace unto them. A <HI>Temple</HI> is made for this Purpose; That there may be upon <HI>Earth,</HI> in the Devotions of Men, Some <HI>Conformity</HI> to what is doing in <HI>Heaven</HI>; And that here may be a fit <HI>Recepta∣cle,</HI> to take in Such <HI>Communications</HI> from <HI>Hea∣ven,</HI> as God will favour Men upon <HI>Earth</HI> withal. This, This is the very purpose of a <HI>Church,</HI> 'Tis made, that <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> may therein come sweetly together; 'Tis made, that <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> may therein Con∣verse with one another.</P>
<P>Secondly. It is to be Remembred, That a <HI>Church</HI> is to take its measures, in many Things, from the <HI>Temple,</HI> which the Lord had of old, in the Land of <HI>Israel.</HI> There was a <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> which <HI>Moses</HI> built for the Special Service of GOD, according to a <HI>Pattern which God had shown him,</HI> of what is Existing, and Managed, in the <HI>Heavenly World</HI> There was a <HI>Second Edition</HI> of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> in an Illustri∣ous
<PB N="10" REF="001408_0011_0FB2FB36DF74FA80"/>
<HI>Temple,</HI> built by <HI>Solomon,</HI> for the Speci∣al Service of GOD, according to the <HI>Further Directions,</HI> which the Visions of God, had given unto his Father <HI>David</HI>; who had a clearer view than <HI>Moses</HI> had, of particularly, the <HI>Throne of Glory,</HI> in the <HI>Third Heaven,</HI> or that Apartment of the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> which was answered, by, <HI>The Holy of Holies,</HI> in the <HI>Temple.</HI> The Dying Servant of God, left that charge; 1 Chron. 22.19. <HI>Now set your Heart and your Soul, to Seek the Lord your God; Arise therefore, and Build ye the Sanctuary of the Lord.</HI> This <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, is now laid in Ashes. GOD has fulfill'd unto the Jews, His Threatning; <HI>Your House shall be Left unto you Desolate.</HI> The Jews are making that bitter complaint; <HI>Our Holy and our Beauteous House, where our Fathers Praised thee, is burnt up with Fire.</HI> But the <HI>Temple</HI> was built on a Spot of Land, bought of a <HI>Gentile</HI>! GOD has many a <HI>Temple</HI> now in the Land of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Every CHURCH of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is now to be a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. It is remarkable, That all the <HI>Furniture</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> Seen by <HI>John,</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> is introduced, as <HI>Liv∣ing.</HI> The very <HI>Lamps,</HI> are <HI>Spirits</HI>; The very <HI>Horns</HI> of the <HI>Altar</HI> have a <HI>Voice</HI>; The <HI>Throne</HI> it self <HI>Speaks.</HI> A <HI>Church</HI> is more like the <HI>Tem∣ple</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> than any <HI>Inanimate Composition</HI> that has been called a <HI>Temple.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Living,</HI> every part of it. But that it may have the more of a <HI>Temple</HI> in it, what was in
<PB N="11" REF="001408_0012_0FB2FB3841C91F70"/>
the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, must be <HI>Imitated</HI> and <HI>Spiritualized</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of the LORD. A <HI>Church</HI> is to consider, what was to be <HI>Seen,</HI> and what was to be <HI>Done,</HI> in the <HI>Tem∣ple;</HI> and to take its Measures accordingly. I fore-see▪ That I must anon Resume this Admonition.</P>
<P>But if a <HI>Church</HI> be a <HI>Temple,</HI> Methinks All that are in the <HI>Church</HI> are hence Admo∣nished. <HI>Holiness becomes this House for ever!</HI></P>
<P>It becomes them, to take up this Resolu∣tion.
<Q>Well; I am in an <HI>Holy Place</HI>: I am where the <HI>Holy God</HI> is present, with Singu∣lar Discoveries of Himself. Oh! Let me be very <HI>Holy.</HI> In such an <HI>Holy Place,</HI> Let me do nothing Offensive unto the Lord, who is <HI>greatly to be feared in the Assembly of the Holy Ones, and to be had in Reverence of all them that are about Him.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> But what <HI>Regard</HI> should the <HI>Parts</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI> have to one another? They should ly well <HI>Together,</HI> that they may be a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. A <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST must have this property, <HI>Built together.</HI> It cannot pretend unto the <HI>Consistency</HI> of a TEMPLE, if it be not so.</P>
<P>First. By a <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> the seve∣ral <HI>Parts</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI> are to be Brought and Laid well <HI>Together.</HI> While men ly <HI>Scat∣tered</HI> one from another, and are not come
<PB N="12" REF="001408_0013_0FB2FB39E0932068"/>
<HI>Voluntarily <HI>together</HI>,</HI> and are not come into a <HI>Voluntary Relation</HI> unto each other, they cannot be a <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And how can they do this, but by a <HI>Mutual Confaederation</HI>? The Formation of a <HI>Church,</HI> is by a <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> wherein men bind themselves to Walk toge∣ther, according to the <HI>Order of the Gospel.</HI> 'Tis a Sacred <HI>Corporation.</HI> Every <HI>Corpora∣tion</HI> is made so by a <HI>Covenant.</HI> It must be by a <HI>Covenant,</HI> that men are <HI>Incorporated</HI> into an Evangelical <HI>Church-State</HI> before the Lord. Tho' the Hazard of having the <HI>Word</HI> mis∣construed among Malignant Enemies, might make the Apostles forbear using the Word, <HI>Covenant,</HI> yet we find the Thing in the Apostolical Writings. We read; Act. 5.13. about, <HI>Joyning</HI> to the Church. The Origi∣nal Word, carries this in it; A <HI>Cleaving to∣gether</HI>; which implies, Their <HI>Mutual Promi∣ses</HI> to <HI>Keep together</HI>: A <HI>Joyning</HI> in that <HI>Co∣venant</HI> or <HI>Agreement,</HI> in which that Church <HI>Associated</HI> for the Worship of the Lord. The Word is the same that is used for the <HI>Marri∣age-Covenant.</HI> A <HI>Church</HI> is a <HI>Spouse</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>; It is by a <HI>Covenant</HI> that they approach unto Him. Brethren, This is the Day of your <HI>E∣spousal</HI> unto the Lord. Where men do not <HI>Im∣plicitly</HI> at least, <HI>Agree</HI> and <HI>Engage, <HI>together</HI>,</HI> to Worship the Lord JESUS CHRIST accor∣ding to His Laws, 'tis almost on all hands Agreed, they neither are, nor can be, <HI>A Church.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001408_0014_0FB2FB3D5F18D4A8"/>
All Reasonable men, will grant as much as this comes to. An <HI>Implicit Covenant</HI> is ne∣cessary to the very Being of a <HI>Church.</HI> And indeed, the <HI>Essence</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI> is preserved, where there is but an <HI>Implicit Agreement</HI> of a Company of Believers, declared by their <HI>constant Practice,</HI> in <HI>coming Together</HI> for the Publick Worship of God, and <HI>Subjection</HI> to His Ordinances. But then, an <HI>Explicit Co∣venant</HI> is Expedient, is Profitable, is Desirea∣ble; Yea, 'Tis a <HI>Duty.</HI> Our GOD must be Served with <HI>Our Best.</HI> We must not <HI>Put off</HI> the Lord with a <HI>Defective Thing,</HI> when we have a <HI>Better.</HI> And we are certain, That an <HI>Explicit Covenant</HI> is <HI>better</HI> than an <HI>Implicit.</HI> The <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> are chosen by the <HI>Church,</HI> and come in with the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Church.</HI> As there must be a <HI>Covenant</HI> be∣tween the <HI>Church</HI> and its <HI>Officers</HI>; thus there must be a <HI>Covenant</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> to Qualify, to Distinguish, to Enable them, that they may <HI>Chuse</HI> their <HI>Officers.</HI> Accordingly, Eccle∣siastical and Unquestionable History Reports to us, <HI>A Covenant,</HI> which the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> had among them. <HI>Tertullian</HI> thus describes a <HI>Church, <HI>Corpus Sumus, de Spei Faedere</HI>,</HI> as <HI>Incorporated</HI> with a <HI>Covenant. <HI>Pliny</HI></HI> relates, That Some <HI>Renegado</HI> Christians being Examined by him, Confessed, They had a <HI>Covenant</HI> among them. <HI>Justin Mar∣tyr</HI> Speaks of <HI>Three Things,</HI> then demanded of all that were Admitted into the Church; A
<PB N="14" REF="001408_0015_0FB2FB4156E271B8"/>
<HI>New Birth</HI>; A <HI>Sound Faith</HI>; and, A <HI>Promise</HI> to walk in Obedience to the Gospel. <HI>Zep∣per</HI> tells us, of many <HI>Reformed</HI> Churches in these Later Ages Reviving this Discipline of the <HI>Primitive</HI>; That they who were Admit∣ted unto the <HI>Lords-Supper</HI> in them, Solemnly Entred into a <HI>Covenant,</HI> That by the Grace of God they <HI>would Order their Lives according to His Word, and Submit unto the Discipline of His Church. Parker</HI> sayes; <HI>Admittitur, non Sine Solenni Pactione, cum Deo, et cum Ecclesiâ.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> is meant, The <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> applied unto those <HI>Duties</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which a <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord is to Observe, that the <HI>Order of the Gospel</HI> may be maintained in it. There are <HI>Particular Duties,</HI> which the <HI>Members</HI> (the <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI>) of <HI>Particular Churches,</HI> owe to one another. They that will not Seriously, and Solemnly <HI>Acknowledge</HI> their Obligations to the <HI>Duties,</HI> are but poorly Qualified to be Ac∣knowledged as <HI>Members</HI> of the <HI>Churches.</HI> Now the <HI>Church-Covenant</HI> in our <HI>Churches,</HI> is nothing else, but that <HI>Acknowledgment.</HI></P>
<P>Some <HI>Disaffected</HI> and <HI>Ʋnacquainted</HI> Persons, may decry the <HI>Covenant</HI> by which our <HI>Churches</HI> are formed, as a <HI>Singularity.</HI> But even in this Day of Deviation from the <HI>Pri∣mitive Discipline,</HI> the Lord ever now and then raises up, some <HI>Testimony</HI> for it. I will at this time only Recite the Words, of Mr. <HI>Ostervaldt,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="001408_0016_0FB2FB44363CC018"/>
a late Outlandish Writer on, <HI>The causes of the present corruption of Christians.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Order</HI> which I mean, is this, First, That when Persons desire to be Admitted unto the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> they should be Instruct∣ed for Some Weeks before, and that the same time, they should be informed of the Sacredness and Importance of the Action, and of the <HI>Promise</HI> they are to make, that so they may prepare for it betimes. In the next place, that they should be <HI>Examined,</HI> and that they should Publickly render an Account of their <HI>Faith.</HI> This Examination, being over, that they should be required, to Renew and Confirm in a Publick and Solemn manner, their <HI>Baptismal Vow,</HI> to Renounce the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Works, the <HI>World</HI> and the Pomp of it, the <HI>Flesh</HI> and its Lusts; and to <HI>Promise,</HI> that they will Live and Dy in the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI> And then, that they should be <HI>Admitted,</HI> to the Communion, by <HI>Benediction</HI> and Prayers.</Q></P>
<P>[He <HI>Proceeds.</HI>]
<Q>The <HI>Order</HI> I propose, will be thought a <HI>Novelty,</HI> by none but such as do not know what was <HI>anciently Practi∣sed,</HI> and who call <HI>Innovations,</HI> every thing which does not agree with the Custom of their Country, or their Church. Besides, this Establishment being altogether Suitable unto the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> it ought not to be Rejected. I Offer this with the greater Confidence, because an <HI>Order</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001408_0017_0FB2FB469782C4B0"/>
like this, has been Settled of late, in some <HI>Churches,</HI> and is there observed with Extra∣ordinary Success.</Q>
[Thus my Author.]</P>
<P>Briefly, The <HI>Covenant</HI> for the Duties of the <HI>Church-State,</HI> is the <HI>Cement</HI> of a <HI>Church.</HI> The <HI>Stones</HI> of a <HI>Temple</HI> are to be well <HI>Cemen∣ted</HI> and <HI>Ʋnited</HI> unto one another, by an Holy <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Several Parts</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> must <HI>Keep well together,</HI> in attending to the <HI>Duties</HI> of the <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> which are now Expected from them. A <HI>Temple</HI> must <HI>Hold well together,</HI> in the Discharge of the <HI>Duties,</HI> whereto the <HI>Church-Covenant</HI> has obliged them that are in it. The <HI>Tem∣ple</HI> falls to Pieces, when the <HI>Church-Members</HI> may have it said of them; Psal. 78 37. <HI>They are not Stedfast in His Covenant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Church-Members,</HI> You have given your selves unto the <HI>Church</HI> whereto you do be∣long; Engaging, <HI>That in the Fellowship thereof you will attend upon the Ordinances of the Glo∣rious Gospel, while your Opportunities to be there∣by Edified in your most Holy Faith shall be conti∣nued.</HI> There is much that you have now to <HI>Do Together,</HI> in waiting on the Lord, that So you may be <HI>Built Together</HI> as a <HI>Temple of the Lord</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Duties,</HI> which the ELDERS of the <HI>Church,</HI> are to do towards the <HI>Brethren.</HI> Oh! That our Glorious LORD would help
<PB N="17" REF="001408_0018_0FB2FB49DA2C35E8"/>
us to <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Practise</HI> our <HI>Duties!</HI> Oh! That we may Spend our Time, in <HI>Praying</HI> for our Flocks, in <HI>Treating</HI> with our Flocks, in a continual <HI>Travail</HI> for their Salvation! Oh! That we might <HI>Watch for the Souls</HI> of our People, as <HI>they that must give an Account</HI>; and be <HI>Prudent and Faithful Stewards</HI> of the Heavenly <HI>Mysteries</HI> unto them! Will you, Brethren, Ask for us those Mercies of God?</P>
<P>I readily acknowledge, Very many, very awful are the <HI>Duties</HI> of the <HI>Elders.</HI> But will my doing so, obtain for me the Liberty now to say, <HI>That the Duties between the Elders and the People are Mutual</HI>? If the <HI>People</HI> would allow this Concession, they might be con∣vinced presently of several <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> which <HI>We</HI> can hardly take the Liberty to mention; Only by considering, <HI>Should the Elders neglect the Church, as much as the Bre∣thren of the Church often cast off the Elders,</HI> doubtless, there would be loud complaints concerning it.</P>
<P>But between the <HI>Elders</HI> and the <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> Methinks, I see the DEACONS, in a <HI>Seat of Eminency,</HI> demanding, — <HI>And what shall we do</HI>? Sirs, You must be Men of <HI>Gravity,</HI> of a Grave and Solid, and Comely Behaviour. You must be <HI>Sincere</HI> men, <HI>Tem∣perate</HI> men, <HI>Bountiful</HI> men; and <HI>Hold the Mystery of Faith in a pure Conscience.</HI> You must with much application Study the <HI>Tem∣poral
<PB N="18" REF="001408_0019_0FB2FB4BCE362B18"/>
Interest,</HI> both of the <HI>Elders</HI> and of the <HI>Brethren.</HI> You must see as far as you can, that none <HI>Suffer by want.</HI> You must use all <HI>Discretion</HI> as well as <HI>Fidelity,</HI> for <HI>Augmenting</HI> as well as <HI>Dispensing,</HI> the <HI>Churches Treasury.</HI> You must have one Vertue more, which is perhaps too little considered; that is, <HI>Much Boldness in the Faith.</HI> The meaning is, That you must Speak Plainly, Freely, <HI>Boldly,</HI> on the behalf of Christ, and His Church, to Such as you find Strait-handed People, not contri∣buting according to their Ability. You must not be Asham'd nor Afraid, but with much <HI>Boldness</HI> tell your Neighbours, when they are Defective in doing their Part, for the Support of Christianity.</P>
<P>I will now go on to say; There are <HI>Duties</HI> which the BRETHREN of the <HI>Church,</HI> owe both to the <HI>Elders,</HI> and to one another. When Things <HI>Ly well together</HI> in the <HI>Temple,</HI> the <HI>Brethren</HI> become well disposed both towards the <HI>Elders,</HI> and towards the <HI>Bre∣thren.</HI> We will describe their Disposition. Oh! That while we are uttering the Des∣cription, the Spirit of Grace may so fall upon You, Our Brethren, as to bring you into it!</P>
<P>The Disposition of the <HI>Brethren</HI> towards the <HI>Elders,</HI> is thus to be Expressed.</P>
<Q><P>I would <HI>highly Esteem</HI> the Men, to whose Conduct I am committed by the Order of GOD, while they shall by their Seriousness and Holiness, and Usefulness, deserve my <HI>Esteem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="001408_0020_0FB2FB4F65CA29F0"/>
I would observe and follow their <HI>Example,</HI> in all those Good Things, wherein the Grace of Christ has made them <HI>Exemplary.</HI></P>
<P>I would make my daily and fervent <HI>Pray∣ers</HI> to GOD for them, that He would pour out His <HI>Blessings</HI> on them, and make them rich <HI>Blessings</HI> to His People.</P>
<P>I would conscientiously Endeavour to <HI>Support</HI> them, and Liberally <HI>Communicate in all Good Things,</HI> unto them, that while I am <HI>Spiritually Enrich'd</HI> by them, they may not Sink in <HI>Temporal Poverty.</HI></P>
<P>I would <HI>Comfort</HI> them in their Adversities, <HI>Defend</HI> them from their Adversaries, <HI>Vin∣dicate</HI> their Innocency from unjust <HI>Re∣proaches.</HI></P>
<P>I would in an Orderly, Suitable, and Obedient manner <HI>Attend</HI> upon them, when I am call'd upon.</P>
<P>The Disposition of the <HI>Brethren</HI> towards <HI>One another</HI> is thus to be Expressed.</P>
<P>I would carry the Flock before the Lord▪ in my constant <HI>Supplications,</HI> and constantly <HI>Pray for the Peace</HI> of the <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>I would Study and pursue the welfare of the <HI>Society,</HI> on all accounts, as I may have Opportunity; and Studiously Maintain its <HI>Purity,</HI> its <HI>Ʋnity,</HI> and all the <HI>Priviledges</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ has purchased for it.</P>
<P>I would Stand by the <HI>Society,</HI> when ever any Storms of <HI>Affliction</HI> may arise upon it;
<PB N="20" REF="001408_0021_0FB2FB50F8B62870"/>
and not abandon it, because it is <HI>Afflicted and tossed with Tempest.</HI></P>
<P>I would <HI>faithfully Give,</HI> and <HI>Thankfully Take, Admonitions,</HI> as in the <HI>Society,</HI> there may be Occasion.</P>
<P>I would help to carry on all the Affayrs of the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> in the <HI>Society</HI> accor∣ding to my <HI>Ability</HI>; In Supplying or Dis∣charging of <HI>Offices</HI>; in Upholding of <HI>Disci∣pline</HI>; Or, what ever must be done, that Religion may be honourably carried on.</P>
<P>I would <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Shun</HI> those that <HI>cause Divisions</HI> in the <HI>Society,</HI> and much be afraid of being my self the cause of <HI>Divisions.</HI></P>
<P>I would have a <HI>Brotherly Sympathy</HI> with the whole <HI>Society,</HI> as being <HI>my self also in the Body,</HI> and Sympathize with every particu∣lar <HI>Member</HI> that may be in any particular <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Oh! what a Lovely <HI>Temple Built toge∣ther</HI> should we see in this Place, if here might be a <HI>Church</HI> thus disposed!</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> But a <HI>Temple Built</HI> thus <HI>together,</HI> what must it be <HI>Built</HI> upon? It must be <HI>Built</HI> upon our Lord JESUS CHRIST. <HI>In Him</HI> a <HI>Church</HI> is to be <HI>Built together.</HI></P>
<P>Excellent Things are implied in this.</P>
<P>First. <HI>In Him</HI>! — Every <HI>Church-Mem∣ber</HI> should be <HI>In Him</HI>; Every <HI>Church-Mem∣ber</HI> should have an <HI>Ʋnion</HI> with the Lord JE∣SUS
<PB N="21" REF="001408_0022_0FB2FB526673CBB8"/>
CHRIST. Who are they, that are fit for for <HI>Church-Fellowship?</HI> we read, Eph. 1.1. <HI>The Saints, and Faithful in Christ Jesus.</HI> Before we come to be in a <HI>Church,</HI> we should be <HI>in the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> They that are not <HI>in</HI> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and that are not <HI>New Creatures,</HI> and that are not <HI>Holy Ones Par∣takers of the Heavenly Calling</HI>; are not Sound Members of the <HI>Church.</HI> Our First work must be to make sure of this, That we be <HI>in</HI> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, by Accepting of Him, as He is Offered unto us. Then we may come to be <HI>in the church,</HI> and welcome. And the Grand care of every One, that is in the Church, it should run upon this; <HI>Am I in the Lord Jesus Christ, or no</HI>? It is not being <HI>in the Church,</HI> that will deliver a man from the Wrath of God. No; 'Tis being <HI>in</HI> the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Our main care must be that; Phil. 3 9. <HI>Oh! That I may be found in Him</HI>!</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>In Him</HI>! — 'Tis a Respect unto <HI>Him,</HI> that must hold us together. <HI>Church-Members</HI> must be United in Respect unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST. This, This must be the <HI>Ʋniting Principle</HI> among us. All <HI>Church-Members</HI> must <HI>hold together</HI> in making the Lord JESUS CHRIST their <HI>Foundation.</HI> 'Tis no <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, which is not <HI>Ʋnited</HI> upon that <HI>Foundation.</HI> We read, Col. 2.19. <HI>Holding the Head,</HI> is necessary. A <HI>Church</HI> falls, if the Members thereof, do
<PB N="22" REF="001408_0023_0FB2FB540358FAB8"/>
not concur, in their <HI>Apprehensions</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; in their <HI>Inclinations</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The <HI>Ʋniting Prin∣ciple</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI> must be This; All the Members of it, must believe, That JESUS is CHRIST, and that CHRIST is GOD; and, That the Things Reveled and Reported in the Gospel, are <HI>Faithful Sayings.</HI> And all the Members of it, must <HI>Prize</HI> CHRIST, as the <HI>Pearl of Great Price,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> CHRIST, as the <HI>Altogether Lovely One,</HI> &amp; <HI>Serve</HI> CHRIST as their only Lord, and prefer a Portion in CHRIST above any Worldly Portion. This is One of the admirable Instances of our GODS <HI>Gathering together all things in CHRIST.</HI> The Members of the <HI>Church</HI> are <HI>Gathered together</HI>; and it is their <HI>Belief</HI> of CHRIST, and their <HI>Homage</HI> to CHRIST, by which they are <HI>Gathered</HI> and <HI>Ʋnited.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>In Him!</HI> — 'Tis on the ac∣count of <HI>Him,</HI> that we are to take up a <HI>Kind∣ness</HI> for one another. All <HI>Church-Members</HI> must be <HI>Kind unto One another,</HI> because of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. There is, 2 Pet. 1.7. <HI>A Brotherly-Kindness,</HI> that must Sweeten the whole carriage of <HI>Church-Members</HI> towards One another. Now this <HI>Brotherly-Kindness,</HI> wherein we are to <HI>Love as Brethren,</HI> what must it be <HI>Built</HI> upon? It must be Built upon the <HI>Command</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Be∣cause the Lord JESUS CHRIST, has given us this <HI>Command, Love One another, <HI>Therefore</HI></HI>
<PB N="23" REF="001408_0024_0FB2FB5637B1A8F0"/>
we should forbear Injuring or Provoking one another; <HI>Therefore</HI> we should <HI>Please each other to Edification; <HI>Therefore</HI></HI> we should be Serviceable to each other, and be ready to do each other all the Good that ever we can. Again; It must be Built upon the <HI>Image</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. We may See something of the <HI>Image</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST in One another; <HI>Therefore,</HI> and <HI>so far,</HI> we should have a <HI>Value</HI> for One another; <HI>Therefore</HI> we should <HI>bear One anothers Bur∣dens,</HI> and make as light as we can of the In∣firmities wherewith any render themselves <HI>Burdensome</HI> unto us; <HI>Therefore</HI> we should close with one another, and come together cheerfully and heartily.</P>
<P>Thus we shall render our selves, <HI>A Tem∣ple of God, built up together in our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P>We are this Day concerned with a <HI>People,</HI> which we now see growing into such a TEMPLE. The most agreeable thing that we can do, is to let this dear <HI>People</HI> of the Lord, Hear what we do on their behalf make our <HI>Wishes</HI> to the Lord. O CHURCH of the Living GOD: We will now utter our <HI>Wishes</HI> for you. And they shall be all Summed up, in this comprehensive One; The LORD make you a TEMPLE for Himself; God grant,

That you may be a <HI>Temple Built up to∣gether in the Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> Oh! That all that Look upon this <HI>Church,</HI> might have cause to Cry out with Joy; A TEM∣PLE, <HI>A Temple of the Lord Jesus Christ! A Glo∣rious Temple of God! An House of GOD, and a Gate of Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>I must have my WISHES, more particu∣larly yet, and more pathetically adapted for you. I will fly away to the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> where we were a few Minutes ago. There I will take a few Turns. I will fetch my WISHES from Some things, whereof I shall take notice there.</P>
<P>I take notice; The <HI>Temple</HI> was built upon Mount <HI>Morijah.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you, O <HI>Church</HI> of the LORD, may be built upon the <HI>Rock of Ages.</HI> The <HI>Truths</HI> which concern a Glorious CHRIST, that <HI>Rock of Ages,</HI> are faithfully Set before you in, <HI>The Confession of Faith,</HI> received among you. May you be well <HI>Founded</HI> on those <HI>Truths,</HI> and may a Blast from GOD, be∣fall all Attempts ever to remove you from them.</P>
<P>But, I also <HI>Wish,</HI> you may never have any but Men, that for their <HI>Peaceableness,</HI> may Me∣rit the Name of <HI>Solomon,</HI> to be your <HI>Builders.</HI></P>
<P>I take notice; The <HI>Temple</HI> was built of <HI>Stones</HI> well <HI>Squared,</HI> of <HI>Trees</HI> well <HI>Hewed.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That the SPIRIT of GOD, by His <HI>Renewing Operations</HI> upon your Minds, may make you all to be Such.</P>

<P>I take notice; The <HI>Temple</HI> had a very <HI>Beau∣tiful Aspect.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That the <HI>Beauty</HI> of your Conversations may be such as to commend <HI>Religion</HI>; Such as to set off your <HI>Profession.</HI></P>
<P>May your <HI>Charity,</HI> the most obvious and visible part of your Behaviour, be like the <HI>Beautiful Porch</HI> of the <HI>Temple.</HI> But the <HI>Porch,</HI> and the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> were of the same Di∣mensions.

<P>But, Oh! That there were more Compas∣sion shown to them, that are lying in the <HI>Porch</HI>! Our <HI>Children</HI> are lying in the <HI>Porch</HI>: There they ly, <HI>Begging Alms.</HI></P>
<P>I take notice; There was an <HI>Outer Court</HI> in the <HI>Temple,</HI> and an <HI>Inner Court.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may be, not meerly Worshippers in the <HI>Outer Court</HI>; not content with outward Shows and Signs of the Fear of God: But that you may also be Worshippers in the <HI>Inner Court</HI>; Acquainted with <HI>Inward,</HI> Sincere, Hearty, and Experimental Piety.</P>
<P>I take notice, of a <HI>Table</HI> with <HI>Loaves</HI> upon it, in the <HI>Temple.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may have CHRIST, as the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> and more than <HI>Half a loaf</HI> of it, every <HI>Sabbath</HI> set be∣fore you.</P>

<P><PB N="29" REF="001408_0030_0FB2FB63B1506F78"/>And, Oh! That your <HI>Minister,</HI> may be a Man <HI>Diligent in his Business,</HI> because he <HI>Stands before the King of Kings</HI>: A Man that shall make it his <HI>whole Business,</HI> to Know <HI>Christ,</HI> &amp; Preach <HI>Christ,</HI> &amp; Serve <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Win Souls</HI> unto Him, and feed you with <HI>Christ,</HI> which is the <HI>Food of Angels</HI>: A Man that shall main∣tain an Holy, Humble, Trembling, &amp; Prayer∣ful <HI>Walk with God,</HI> and render it your Safety to <HI>Follow Him,</HI> as a <HI>Follower of the Lord</HI>: A Man that where-ever he comes, will be <HI>always at Work</HI> for GOD, and for YOU; <HI>Do Good</HI> con∣tinually; Be always full of Contrivances to <HI>Do Good</HI>; Never be <HI>Well,</HI> but when Employ'd in some <HI>Good Work,</HI> and Study to be a <HI>Work∣man that need not be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>May this CHURCH of the Lord, be such a TEMPLE, and so accommodated; Then shall we say, <HI>'Tis Good to be here.</HI></P>
<P>I will not break off, till I have Illustrated that Saying, with quoting Two passages.</P>
<P>One Passage must be from our Incompara∣ble <HI>Goodwin,</HI> who having described, the Grand Intention of a <HI>Congregational Church,</HI> com∣ing together,
<Q><HI>To Worship the Lord, and Edify One another in all His Holy Ordinances</HI>;</Q> adds, <Q>'Tis an <HI>Honourable</HI> Assembly, wherein CHRIST is the Head! And they meet, not for the Good of the <HI>Common wealth</HI> directly; tho' that be honourable, yet it is nothing to the Salvation of Souls, and the Edifying of One another in the Fear of God. How there∣fore
<PB N="30" REF="001408_0031_0FB2FB6550C07F78"/>
should all matters be carried? There should nothing appear but the <HI>Presence of Christ</HI>; the Love of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Power of His <HI>Grace</HI>: And then, they are the most <HI>honourable</HI> Meetings in the World!</Q></P>
<P>Another Passage must be, from our celebrated <HI>Shepard</HI>; who in a <HI>Manuscript,</HI> which I have in my hands, relates the Gathering of the Church at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> quickly after his coming into <HI>New England,</HI> and the condition of his own Vertuous Consort at that time very near her Death, of a Consumption. The Relation has these words in it.
<Q>It pleased the Lord to joyn us into <HI>Church-fellowship.</HI> After the Day was ended, we came to her Chamber, She being unable to come unto us. And because we feared, her End was not far off, we did solemnly ask her, <HI>If she was desirous to be a Member with us.</HI> Which she Expressing▪ and so Entring into <HI>Covenant</HI> with us, we there∣upon all took her by the hand, and received her as become One with us▪ having had full Trial &amp; Experience of her Faith &amp; Life be∣fore. At this Time, and by this means, the Lord did not only show us the worth of this Ordinance, but gave us a Seal of His Accep∣ting of us, and of His Presence with us <HI>that Day.</HI> For the Lord hereby fill'd her Heart, with such unspeakable Joy and Assurance of Gods Love, that She said to us, <HI>She had now Enough</HI>; and we were afraid, her Feeble Body, would have at that time fallen, under the
<PB N="31" REF="001408_0032_0FB2FB66C7493818"/>
weight of her Joy. Thus She told me; <HI>Tho' in my Judgment▪ I saw that the Lord had Loved me, yet in my Affection I fear'd, that there might be some flaw in my Heart, Some Sin in my Soul, which might Separate between me &amp; my God, at the Last, which I neither Saw, nor Others could discern: But now, by this Ordinance, the Lord hath Satisfied &amp; driven away my Fears. I look on my Entrance into the Church of Christ here, as a Resemblance &amp; Fore-runner, of my Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven among the Saints there. And tho' I know, that Hypocrites are, &amp; may be received into the Bosom of the Church, yet I am willing the Lord should try me, &amp; mend me, and by this Means, He hath Sealed it unto me, that I am not One of them.</HI> And thus, a Fort∣night almost before her Death, unto her Departure, in the midst of most bitter Afflicti∣ons &amp; anguishes, her Peace continued.</Q></P>
<P>I return to the <HI>Temple.</HI> May this <HI>Church,</HI> be such a <HI>Temple</HI>; Then, as there were <HI>Che∣rubims</HI> on the Walls of the <HI>Temple,</HI> the very <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD, will take Pleasure, to Behold you, to Befriend you.</P>
<P>Yea, Then, The Glorious LORD Himself, will afford a most gracious Presence of His unto You. And, <HI>Lord, If thou wilt be here, we shall not Dye; nor shall the Souls of our Children Dye</HI>!</P>
<P>The Name of this <HI>Church</HI> will be, <HI>Iehovah Shammah,</HI> THE LORD IS THERE.</P>
