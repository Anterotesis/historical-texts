<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR illustrious Performance exhibited to the Public on that most important question, whether <HI>A—a</HI> was known to the A—s, reflects the highest honor not only to you but to your ancient, worthy, and ve∣nerable Predecessors, and may well be tacked as an appendix to the wondrous Magnalia: Herein is verified that saying, Every genera∣tion grows wiser and wiser. It must afford am∣ple satisfaction not only to the inquisitive Gen∣tleman you mean to gratify, but fill the whole world with wonder and amazement at the gross stupidity and indolence of many centu∣ries past. Worthy and great Writers have al∣ways had envious opponents, and in propor∣tion to their great and serviceable discove∣ries and endeavors for the welfare of the com∣munity expect their attacks: But what shall we say of such men who are continually emitting their contagious poison? You doubt∣less remember the saying of the Poet,
<Q><L>—Jam saevus apertam,</L>
<L>In rabiem caepit verti jocus et per honestas</L>
<L>Ire minax impuné domos.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> says a libel in his day, which took
<PB N="6" REF="012965_0004_0F9040FC0C5EA810"/>
away a man's good name was punished with death. By this means the honor of families are ruined, and highest posts and greatest titles are rendered cheap and vile in the sight of the people, the noblest virtues and most exalted parts exposed to the contempt of the vicious and ignorant. And as this cruel prac∣tice tends to the utter subversion of all truth and humanity among us, it deserves the ut∣most detestation, abhorrence and discourage∣ment of all who have either the love of their country or the honor of their religion at heart.
<Q><L>He who filches from me my good name,</L>
<L>Enriches not himself, but makes me poor indeed.</L>
<BIBL>Shak</BIBL></Q>
These men together with their adherents who take pleasure in reading them, may be justly ranked with the murderer and assassin. Every good man sets as high a value on his name as on his life, and those who privily assault the one would destroy the other, could they do it with the same secrecy and impunity. How many there are of this character among us public pamphets and news-papers mani∣festly evince. <HI>O tempora! O mores!</HI></P>
<P>I need not here remind you of the vast disproportion between a libel against gover∣ment and a private member of community. That you may be armed against an assault of this nature, remember that a private desire of resentment subdued denominates a man great, And that if you are led away with the cen∣sures or applauses of men, when wisdom shall be justified of her children you will be found desti∣tute of those graces which adorn human nature.</P>
<P>Having had an opportunity of knowing
<PB N="7" REF="012965_0005_0F9040FCC06A0C70"/>
the sentiments, with regard to your motives, of a number of persons of the above describ∣ed character, I shall here present you a speci∣men of a few of them for your animadversion.</P>
<P>Some say you have catched an epidemical distemper called by <HI>Juvenal</HI> an itch of writing.</P>
<P>Some say you have long in vain been in pursuit of a Diploma from <HI>North-Britain,</HI> but despising the modern method of obtaining it, continue impatiently seeking it through the channel of merit.</P>
<P>Some say you expressed a huge fancy to be chose President of <HI>Harvard</HI>-College, and that you are now endeavoring to convince the ho∣norable Electors of their egregious mistake in not calling you to that important trust.</P>
<P>Some say you are encouraged from the effects of a former harangue on Liberty, pro∣ductive of a boon.</P>
<P>Others that one of the BEST of men is the intended object of your keen resentment.</P>
<P>Others that you are employed as a Popish Incendiary to foment strife.</P>
<P>Others are so ill natured as to say you are influenced by the fair Daughters of Liberty, on whose account you have already suffered a dire flogging at an ecclesiastical council.</P>
<P><HI>Cum multis aliis quae nunc prescribere</HI> won't do.</P>
<P>These are some of the surmises of this rude herd with regard to your motives: Nor do I find their sentiments with regard to your most excellent Performance more favorable; for in general they say, their expectations be∣ing raised to the highest pitch (from the name of the Author and grandeur of the sub∣ject)
<PB N="8" REF="012965_0006_0F9040FF80564208"/>
they are as greatly disappointed as at the production of <HI>Aesop</HI>'s teaming mountain.</P>
<P>You'll need abundance of grace and pa∣tience while I transcribe their arguments against you. The learned <HI>Keckerman,</HI> you say, judges that <HI>A—a</HI> was known to the A—ts. They say you begin well; but you should have let them known he was infallible. You go on and say, if the matter be examin∣ed with judgment and proper care and ac∣curacy, we shall find reason to believe that this large part of the world was <HI>really</HI> known to the A—ts.</P>
<P>How honest <HI>Madoc</HI> came to take it into his head to visit <HI>A—a</HI> you don't know, nor how he got out of it you can't tell; but he left monuments of the <HI>British</HI> language and customs. What of the language found a∣mong the <HI>Indians</HI> you do not say; nor customs, whether eating when hungry, or Priests sporting with their female parishio∣ners. But they ask, upon supposition it were true that <HI>Madoc</HI> was in <HI>A—a,</HI> does that prove your point?</P>
<P>As to <HI>Eslotiland,</HI> it being agreed by all to be part of <HI>A</HI>—, as you say, the point must be given up, as it was discovered by the <HI>Frizeland</HI> Fishermen and the <HI>Polonian,</HI> ever since the year 1456: But they say you beg the question, and it seems they had such a knowledge of it, that they nor their neighbors ever troubled their heads any further with it.</P>
<P><HI>L. Anneus Seneca,</HI> you say, foretold that another world should be found out, and in one of his dramatic pieces, says, <HI>Thyphis</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="012965_0007_0F9041009232EB98"/>
should discover new worlds; but what that can be to your purpose they can't tell, unless he did discover new Worlds and <HI>A—a</HI> was included in the number.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Metellius Celer,</HI> Proconsul of <HI>Gaul</HI> having a number of <HI>Indians</HI> presented him by the <HI>Suevian</HI> King, you imagine them waf∣ted by violent gales of long continuance (they suppose in <HI>Indian</HI> canoes with large stores of provisions) from <HI>Labrador</HI> or <HI>Newfoundland</HI> to the <HI>German</HI> shore. This seems to appear very strange to 'em▪ and fancy they must have had wet hides now and then: But they seem inclined to think you are not well skill'd in the geography of this part of the globe, or with the turbulence of the atlantic ocean, and rather think they came from <HI>Lunar Hesperia,</HI> as frogs are said to descend <HI>ex nubibus</HI> in a shower of rain. But suppose it true, what kind or degree of knowledge could the <HI>Sue∣vians</HI> have had from those rude savages?</P>
<P>Mention, you say, has been made repeat∣edly of two islands called <HI>Atlantides,</HI> ten thousand stadia distant from <HI>Lybia,</HI> and cal∣led by <HI>Pliny, Hesperides,</HI> which the learned <HI>Ortellius</HI> supposes to be the islands of <HI>Hispa∣niola</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> and <HI>Diadorus Siculus</HI> tells us that the people of those islands in habit places near the ocean, and therefore they must be the inhabitants of <HI>Cuba</HI> because surrounded by the ocean.
<Q>Here were the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> fields, the seat of the blessed, and, as the above author says, the inhabitants were very hap∣py indeed.</Q>
Logical arguing, deservant of a Presidentship!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012965_0008_0F904101DB6686C0"/><HI>Plato</HI> has given particular account, you say, of the <HI>Atlantic Island,</HI> as published by <HI>Serranus,</HI> and of its being peopled by <HI>Neptune</HI> with chil∣dren begot of a mortal woman. They say one would think you were in one of your youthful freaks, and imagined the gods were subject to like passions with yourself. They say if they understand you right the argu∣ment stands thus: <HI>Neptune</HI> was an ancient god, from his nature must have known the extent of his jurisdiction, the atlantic ocean being bound west on the <HI>A—an</HI> shore, of consequence he must have known it; there∣fore <HI>A—a</HI> was known to the A—ts. That it received its name from King <HI>Atlas,</HI> and <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars was
<Q>its eastern bounds; that it was a most broad island, had pow∣erful kings, and what else they cannot tell, except they had grievous wars, in which the <HI>Athenians</HI> oppos'd themselves and be∣came conquerors. <HI>Plato,</HI> you say, is not singular herein, but <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> con∣firm it.</Q>
They say you do them great honor. <HI>Plato</HI> says further, the greatest island of the western ocean was lost, situated be∣tween the <HI>Azores</HI> and <HI>Canaries,</HI> and that there were
<Q>reliques of it, you say, <HI>Becman</HI> thought, believed, and says might be lengthily proved.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Hoffman</HI> and <HI>Bochart</HI> are of opinion that <HI>Plato</HI>'s atlantis is to many <HI>A—a</HI>: And indeed, you say, if it was larger than <HI>Lybia</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> it looks as if it were really <HI>A—.</HI></Q>
Thus you are endeavoring to prove, that what is now and ever was unknown to
<PB N="11" REF="012965_0009_0F90410200E913F8"/>
us a sunken island was known, in order to prove that the terra firma on which we now dwell was known to the A.....ts.</P>
<P>The probability arising from the accounts of passages of vessels through the atlantic one way and the other must be barely probable, and of <HI>Endoxus</HI>'s voyage in the days of our Grandfathers to <HI>Cales</HI> must have been round by the edges as St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s voyages were, or by lucky chance.</P>
<P>But now you call, they say, to a respectful notice of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the famous <HI>Carthagenian,</HI> who wrote Periplum, which has not been your lot to see, and therefore can make no observations. 'Tis a pity! But you say he gives an account of a voyage prosecuted around the coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and found lands in the atlantic ocean. Surely it was a spae∣rical round, if he found any of the main of <HI>A.....a.</HI></P>
<P>But we must not omit to take notice, that the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> must have had the knowledge of it, for <HI>Diadorus Siculus</HI> beforementioned in his De fabulosis antiquorum gestis) says, that certain <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were cast on a most fertile island opposite to <HI>Africa,</HI> and you, to accommodate yourself, note that if it was opposite to <HI>Africa</HI> it must have been an <HI>A.....n</HI> island: But pray, Reverend Sir, with profound submission, why not one of the <HI>Azores,</HI> or even St. <HI>Helen'</HI>s? And if so, no wonder the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> did not divulge <HI>A.....a</HI> to the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>Upon supposition that <HI>Silenas</HI> gave <HI>Midas</HI> information, as you say, that <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="012965_0010_0F904102CBAAFFE0"/>
and <HI>Africa</HI> were islands, and of the existence of another world whose magnitude was im∣mense and infinite, will it follow from thence that <HI>A.....a</HI> was known to the A.....ts? Do not you Priests preach up unknown worlds, and some of you live as though you were not willing to part with a certainty for an uncertainty?</P>
<P>As for <HI>Hanuo</HI>'s voyage beforerementioned, when you leave the <HI>Herculian</HI> pillars, the <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> you find about ten thousand stadia from <HI>Lybia</HI> the large islands of <HI>Atlantides</HI>; but go∣ing again to reconnoitre them, on your return, say you can't find 'em, to your great disap∣pointment, and conclude they are destroyed by a flood or earthquake: Surely, they say, it must have been <HI>Cape Flyaway,</HI> frequently seen by mariners in the atlantic ocean. And fur∣ther, this voyage has misled you a thousand stadia from your point, and no wonder, since they must have been destitute of a compass: For leaving <HI>Lybia</HI> on the left (the coast lying nearly north and south) and sailing thirty days (meet with impediments, and no doubt it was very lucky if they ever found their way back, though you don't say they ever did; but you might have made the story for them as you did for <HI>Madoc</HI>) steer south. If <HI>Lybia</HI> was on the left their course must have been nearly south, notwithstanding which, you imagine it probable that they must have found some of the <HI>A—an</HI> islands, or some part of the western continent itself, which they say must be as impossible as for designing Priests to receive the rewards of the faithful.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012965_0011_0F90410386993968"/><HI>Grotius</HI>'s conception of the peopling <HI>A.....a</HI> from <HI>Europe</HI> (notwithstanding what you have said of <HI>Serranus</HI>) upon supposition that <HI>Hispaniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba</HI> were the seats of the blessed as you imagine, and as you say the rout is possible and not unnatural, passing from <HI>Europe</HI> through <HI>Norway</HI> into <HI>Iceland,</HI> thence by <HI>Frizeland</HI> into <HI>Greenland,</HI> and so in∣to <HI>Estotiland,</HI> must needs make a dreary tra∣vel for the heavenly Pilgrims: No wonder the emigrants never returned to give account of their situation, in this new <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> How greatly doth it dignify the Priesthood that the rewards of virtue are so much more easily obtained in these modern days!</P>
<P>They readily allow that <HI>A—a</HI> was well peopled four or five thousand years ago, and that when <HI>Columbus</HI> arrived here he found multitudes of inhabitants: But what is that to your purpose? You have been endeavor∣ing to prove they originated from <HI>Europe,</HI> and where not, though they have chosen to o∣mit it 'till now. But does <HI>Columbus</HI> say he found any of his countrymen among them, any Whites, or any others that could give any account of their rise from <HI>Europe,</HI> or any o∣ther of the known part of the globe? If he had you would undoubtedly have snap'd at it, they say, to help you out of the sudds, and they wonder you did not assert that he did.</P>
<P>As to your suppositions, conjectures, and deductions with regard to <HI>Gog, Magog,</HI> &amp;c. they are so various, and all drawn to help your important cause, they say they are not worthy an answer, and had you ever read
<PB N="14" REF="012965_0012_0F904104433559A0"/>
the 38th and 39th chapters of <HI>Ezek.</HI> you would have been better informed. How inconsistent the glorious rise of the western empire from that race, with the 39th chap∣ter from 11th to 17th verse, unless your fer∣tile brain produces a Phoenix. But how∣ever, there seems to be one observation of Dr. <HI>Grew</HI>'s worthy of note, which you seem to hug as making much to your point, name∣ly, that there were no Blacks found in <HI>A.....a,</HI> and you therefore observe there could be no removes from <HI>Africa.</HI> But pray, learned Sir, with defference to your superior knowledge in antiquity, were there found any Whites? and if not, why does not the argument bear as much against the supposed removes from <HI>Europe</HI>? But, pray Sir, how came the inha∣bitants yellow? They are of opinion, you imagine, by their carrying on their backs large packs of provision and necessary cloath∣ing for the performance of their long travel, as you have chaulk'd out the road, their hides by intermitting colds and heats were gra∣dually tann'd and became so.</P>
<P>As to what you advance from the Scrip∣tures and progress of the Apostles, they leave your best friends to judge of its absurdity. How are the sacred Scriptures tortur'd and warp'd to base purposes! No wonder they are held in such contempt by the undescerning part of mankind, when Priests would cram down any thing for truth that suits their turn; and they imagine your lugging in the Scriptures to help you (had you a common chance) would have been a great
<PB N="15" REF="012965_0013_0F90410511954FF0"/>
disservice to Christianity, and overballance all the service you ever did its cause. Thus, they say, you have been racking your brain to prove your motto false, by proving, <HI>Aliquid tam difficile est quod quaerendo investiga∣ri non possit.</HI> Surely by the ancients you must have meant the original inhabitants of <HI>A—a.</HI> They express themselves as though Brother <HI>C—r</HI> has set you ageg to display your lustre, as he takes you now and then for a foil for his own. How easily are in∣considerate men ensnar'd in the trap of vain glory! And what could have induc'd you to have gone so far beyond your line, but predominant pride, which such Priests are so ready to condemn in the Laity? of whom you take all advantages from your pulpits, branding them with the odious epithets of children of the Devil, while you only are the sons of light. Thou that teacheth ano∣ther, teacheth thou not thyself, &amp;c. They query, if St. <HI>Paul</HI> and other Apostles were accounted the filth of the world, and offscour∣ing of all things, pray what appellation are you deservant of?</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<P>AS to your Appendix, notwithstanding your zeal and strength of argument with re∣gard to your Remarks should recommend them to every considerate and worthy mem∣ber of <HI>A.....a,</HI> your moderation being known to all men, they seem to treat them with un∣deserved contempt, and say the bitter com∣plaint you make of the hard treatment the <HI>A—ans</HI> have suffer'd have been so often ad∣vanc'd and nothing new therein brought to light, either to augment or redress them, there needs but few observations.</P>
<P>As to your query, "What hurt does my writing do?" They answer, neither good nor hurt, but your views and designs are what they detest. What hurt in setting <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>A—a</HI> by the ears? the peaceful gos∣pel you preach teaches you agreable thereto, for you bend it which way you please. The good esteem of the High Sons, or in other words, a good reward is all you care for, they say. Commending your cunning to pre∣vent drowning, you wisely omit touching on the tender point of Legislative Right as past your depth; but, they say, you discover your self as well skil'd in the mystery of merchan∣dize as in the science and art of geography and navigation, when you assert that the <HI>A—ans</HI> have suffer'd great loss by the <HI>Britons</HI> in their trade and commerce. Pray, Dr. <HI>Knowall,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="012965_0015_0F90410834DBC8B8"/>
who is it takes our naval stores, oil, bone, masts, timber, and other exports off our hands? And what are the inducements but proposal of mutual benefit? Who loses when <HI>A—an</HI> Merchants fail thousands sterling in debt to <HI>Britain?</HI> And though you fleer at the Legi∣slative Authority of Parliament, by saying, "Let its favorers call it supream if they will," they would ask you a few questions in their turn; "and what hurt in it?" Pray, Rev. Sir, what idea can you form of a King or So∣vereign destitute of power or authority over his subjects?</P>
<P>How is the dignity of the Crown and nati∣on to be supported? Suppose his Majesty's ships and armies were disbanded, what a fi∣gure would <HI>Britain</HI> cut among the neigh∣boring nations?</P>
<P>How is the immense expence attending to be provided for, but by tax on the subjects? Why should <HI>A—a</HI> be exempt, who have equally the benefit of defence? "Why for∣sooth, because they took <HI>Cape-Briton</HI> in the year 1745," though they had the assistance of Admiral <HI>Warren,</HI> and a number of the King's ships, and great part of their charge was re∣imbursed by the Commons of <HI>Britain.</HI> You further add, it would be wisdom in <HI>Britain</HI> to lay not so much as one burthen upon them: Well judged, Mr. <HI>Dictator.</HI></P>
<P>Has the insignificant Parliament of <HI>Great- Britain</HI> power to lay a tax on the national ex∣ports? Do the <HI>A—an</HI> Merchants volunta∣rily submit to such tax, when they purchase the <HI>British</HI> exports? If so, then let the fol∣lowing
<PB N="18" REF="012965_0016_0F9041095BFFD4D8"/>
considerations be attended to, remov∣ing all party prejudice;</P>
<P><HI>A</HI>'s a Fair Trader.</P>
<P><HI>B</HI>'s a Smuggler.</P>
<P><HI>C</HI>'s a Purchaser of the Importer.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> sends his money to <HI>Britain,</HI> and pays the King's just duties.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> sends his money to the neighboring nations, and pays no duties, whereby his mo∣ney is sunk with regard to <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>A—a</HI> both.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> and <HI>B.</HI> are neighbors, and deal in the same commodities.</P>
<P><HI>C.</HI> inquires the price of an article of <HI>A.</HI> He answers 5 £. is the lowest. Applies to <HI>B.</HI> He asks him 4 <HI>J.</HI> for the same in quan∣tity and quality; consequently <HI>C.</HI> purchases of <HI>B.</HI> and leaves honest <HI>A.</HI> to starve. Where is the justice of this? Why is your pen dip'd in gaul? Where is your golden rule? Are these things right? Is it not then of absolute necessity that Government should interpose to right themselves and the Fair Trader? And what more effectual method than by ap∣pointing the Board of Commissioners, and sending cruizers on the coast to intercept these Smugglers, enemies both to King and sub∣jects. I expect you will fly in a passion at my thus stating this affair; but look over it a∣gain, and weigh it well. Don't view it and start back as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in Magnalian days, did their horrid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and run away affright∣ed without examining the object. Examine it well, you'll <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it flesh and bones, no me∣taphysical chimera, but as conclusive as a ma∣thematical demonstration.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012965_0017_0F90410998065078"/>How much greater burthens do the <HI>Bri∣tons</HI> bear than the <HI>A.....ans</HI>? They pay a tax on every article they eat, drink, or wear, and even for the light of the sun; but the <HI>A—ans</HI> only for what they voluntarily chuse with regard to <HI>Britain.</HI> How does the honest Farmer laugh in his sleeve to hear your complaints, who wears no cloathing, nor eats or drinks any thing but his own produce. Leave your luxury and carry on an an equi∣table trade, your complaints will soon cease.</P>
<P>With regard to Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s observation, they say it is undoubtedly true that wisdom travels west, and the reason they assign is your travelling east. Mr. <HI>White,</HI> your Predecessors, and other worthies of a prophetical turn always predicted future events, looking forward for the recompence of their virtue, but you, like <HI>Lot</HI>'s wife, or the <HI>Israelites</HI> after deliverance from <HI>Egypt,</HI> look back as loth to proceed, dreading the consequence; and well you may, they say. They would have had me added a few strictures on the Seventh Com∣mandment, and the LORD's Prayer; but as to the latter, as you say it is not becoming Christians to use, I chuse to decline.</P>
<P>A few REMARKS on your supposed mo∣tives will finish.</P>
<P>By the above absurd, base misconstructions, false logic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we find what a virtuoso of an age we live in. How triumphant are the sons of calumny and defamation! How vio∣lent are the influences of prejudice! I have had the satisfaction of some small acquain∣tance with you, and could fully have vouch'd
<PB N="20" REF="012965_0018_0F90410A55CFA610"/>
for your honor and honesty, and am well sa∣tisfied of your swearing to your hurt and changing not, which the Psalmist gives as a characteristic of a citizen of <HI>Zion,</HI> where no∣thing enters that makes a lye, which is one reason of my adopting your cause. The in∣genious Anagram on your Father, by the pious Author of his life, <HI>Tu Homo Ter Sanctus,</HI> would be improper to ascribe to you while living.</P>
<P>As to your first motive, they alledge you have catch'd an itch at writing.</P>
<P>Can any wonder at your frequent writing, when your genius is peculiar, cash runs low, "Providence calls to stir up your gift," your subjects always new and alarming, Printers ready to give any price for your copies, whether your assertions are prov'd or not it matters not a groat, if your ends are answer'd.</P>
<P>As to your seeking a Diploma; I expect∣ed your Dissertations on JEHOVAH and the LORD's Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which you sent to <HI>Scotland</HI> would have produc'd it, but I suppose they judg'd them not so weighty as Cash: How∣ever, hope you are not discouraged, for I'll warrant you a D. D. (of which you are high∣ly deservant) very soon; although you find your <HI>North-British</HI> Brethren so insensi∣ble of your incomparable abilities, as a new manufacture of Diploma-making is lately established in <HI>America.</HI> Surely, Reverend Sir, you cannot fail of a homespun one, as you have shone with such distinguish'd lus∣tre among some other Worthies of the <HI>Cloth,</HI> in the defence of <HI>American</HI> Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="012965_0019_0F90410B028D9C38"/>As to their imagination of your having a huge fancy for the Presidentship; the insi∣nuation is an affront to your natural modes∣ty: But however the Electors can inform any who enquire, whether you did'nt give some hint tending thereto: But suppose you had, they'd find few better qualify'd; your inimitable seraphic display of your forefinger in your zealous enforcing your injunctions would yield a sublime lustre to that august University: Omitting private conversation on that subject, I can't pass taking notice of the indignity reflected, when instead thereof you were offer'd the Praeceptorship of the <HI>North Latin-school.</HI></P>
<P>As to your view of a Boon; no doubt but your unwearied pains and sweat in collecting and twisting from ancient authors (tho' fabu∣lous, they say) your several arguments, and stat∣ing the unhappy situation of <HI>A—a,</HI> with your seasonable and necessary hints are highly de∣servant of an adequate reward; and though some men would not take the trouble of reading them over for twice the money you have got for e'm, and may call it an harangue, 'tis most certain he who wins has the best right to laugh.</P>
<P>As to a certain, GOOD MAN you mean to injure, if it's the Person I imagine you mean, common gratitude must remove so base an insinuation, or you must have publicly recom∣mended that virtue contrary to your practice, which is inconsistent with common honesty; however, herein leave you to answer for yourself.</P>
<P>As to being a Popish Incendiary; its true
<PB N="22" REF="012965_0020_0F90410BC35C0028"/>
I have known of a long correspondence you have had at <HI>Canada,</HI> but the letters you re∣ceiv'd were wrote in French, and tho' I have seen some of them, I cannot ascertain their contents, but never imagined there was any such design on so honest a man as I conceiv'd you to be, but rather inclin'd to think those lines applicable to you:
<Q><L>I hate the busy plotting crew</L>
<L>Who make distracted times,</L>
<L>And shun their wicked company</L>
<L><HI>As</HI> I avoid their crimes.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Tate and Brady's Ps. xxvi. 5.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As to your being influenced by the Daugh∣ters of Liberty; the wise man tacks women and wine together as equally to be avoided, and I have always look't on't for a person guilty of an attrocious crime to endeavour to extenuate it by pleading his being under the influence of a Daughter of <HI>Eve,</HI> (there being no general rule without exception) equally culpable as for another in a similar case to plead being in his cups, for they are conti∣nually at our elbows, by smiles, gesture, dress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> endeavoring to ensnare us, and how few have escap'd them, especially in youth: But imagine you must have been too knowing to have been taken in at this time of day. And as to what they call dire flogging, your Ec∣clesiastical Judges might have been as partial as the former Judges of your country when they hung a poor bedrid Weaver to save a better man. As to their observations on your arguments, they are evidently insuffi∣cient to evade the force of your's, and there∣fore

can admit of no reply. It rests with you Sir, <HI>Gallio</HI> like to act yourself, a man of for∣titude and courage beyond the reach or notice of such envious tatlers, having performed the task assign'd yourself to the approbation of your own mind and receiv'd a handsome gratuity from the High Sons, notwithstand∣ing the fleers of the vulgar and —approbation of the more knowing you may appropriate those lines;
<Q><L>As him a heav'nly zeal doth move,</L>
<L>So Heav'n his zealous acts approve,</L>
<L>To him confirming as his place,</L>
<L>The Priesthood he so well doth grace.</L></Q></P>
