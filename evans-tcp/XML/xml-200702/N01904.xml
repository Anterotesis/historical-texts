<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB, XV.21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>A Dreadful Sound is in his Ears—.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>ND if the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> be now repeated in <HI>our Ears,</HI> it is with such an Accent as this upon it, <HI>Hear this, and know it for thy Good.</HI> The <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> shall not be made <HI>Audible</HI> unto us, upon any Design but this, That we may become those whom it shall <HI>not belong</HI> unto; That we may <HI>Escape</HI> the Things contained in it, That we may be <HI>Saved with Fear,</HI> and be <HI>Perswaded</HI> into the Methods of our Salvation, <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>If it be Enquired, <HI>Who</HI> 'tis that has the <HI>Dreadful Sound in his Ears</HI>? The Answer must be fetched out of the preceeding Verse, 'Tis the <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> If you can say with <HI>Job,</HI> Lord, <HI>Thou knowest I am not wicked</HI>; Then, all the while you have the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in your <HI>Ears,</HI> it will be drowned with the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002251_0003_0FDADAD38E27B3F8"/>
of your Deliverance from all these Terrible Things. But the same <HI>Job</HI> said, <HI>If I be Wicked, Wo unto me</HI>! If any of you, <HI>my Neighbours,</HI> are conscious of your coming under that Character, the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in your Ears, 'tis fit you should be made sensible of it, that so <HI>being moved with fear,</HI> you may do those things which will prepare you for a more <HI>Joyful Sound.</HI> The Best Thing that can be done for you is, That the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in your <HI>Ears,</HI> may awaken you into that cry, <HI>O wretched one that I am, who shall deliver me!</HI></P>
<P>A Servant of GOD, here maintains this As∣sertion; That <HI>perpetual Pain is the Portion of a Wicked Man.</HI> The Life of a Wicked Man is all spent in continual <HI>Throws,</HI> to bring forth, nothing but that ugly Monster <HI>Sin</HI>; which when it is <HI>Finished brings forth Death.</HI> We La∣ment the Condition of some who are <HI>several Days in Travail:</HI> But Oh! how Lamentable the Condition of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> who <HI>Travaileth in pain all his Days</HI>! Yea, the <HI>Pain</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> is in this point, worse than the <HI>Pain of a Woman in Travail.</HI> For <HI>when she is Delivered, she remembreth her anguish no more,</HI> for the <HI>Joy</HI> of what is <HI>Born into the World.</HI> But so far is the <HI>Pain</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> from <HI>ending in Joy,</HI> that it hath no End at all. He <HI>Tra∣vaileth in Pain all his Days.</HI></P>
<P>My Text is a Demonstration and an Illus∣tration of what is thus asserted. A <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> or a Sound of Terrors, is in <HI>his Ears.</HI> And this is the awful DOCTRINE to be now insisted on,
<Q><PB N="3" REF="002251_0004_0FDAC95F589E94F0"/>THERE are Things which make a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> does not always hear the <HI>Dreadful Sound.</HI> There is a <HI>deep sleep</HI> for the pre∣sent prevailing on a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> Though the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> be in his <HI>Ears,</HI> yet he stops his <HI>Ears</HI> against it. But there will a Time come, when the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> will force its way into his <HI>Ears</HI>; he will be no longer able to stop his <HI>Ears.</HI> I was going to say, it shall <HI>now</HI> do so! It must be the Work of them who ma∣nage the <HI>Publick Exhortations,</HI> to make this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> become as Articulate, as Intelligible, as Efficacious as may be, in the <HI>Ears</HI> of their Auditors. 'Tis our Commission to ut∣ter the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI>; We are to <HI>say</HI> that thing, and <HI>Cry aloud, and lift up our voice like a Trumpet</HI> in saying of it, Isa. I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I.2. <HI>We to the wicked, it shall be ill with him.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuance of this Commission, we will first make this Enquiry,</P>
<P><HI>WHO is the <HI>Wicked Man?</HI></HI></P>
<P>And surely, When it is asked, <HI>Who is the <HI>Wicked Man</HI></HI>? It must needs be a <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> in the Ears of the Man to whom it shall be with Conviction said, <HI>Thou art the Men.</HI> For this to be spoken from the Word of GOD unto any Man, <HI>Thou art a Wicked Man</HI>; verily There cannot be a more <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> heard among the Children of Men. I shall proceed upon it; <HI>Who is the <HI>Wicked Man?</HI></HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002251_0005_0FDADAD859E19C40"/>It must be answered, First, More Negatively. 'Tis not meerly to be a <HI>Sinner,</HI> that will con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>e a <HI>Wicked Man. Eliphaz</HI> does not say or every Man who may fall into a Sin, A <HI>Dreadful Sound is in his Ears.</HI> For, <HI>There is not a Just Man upon Earth, who doeth good and sin∣neth not.</HI> It has been truly observed, The <HI>Best of Saints</HI> while here on Earth are <HI>Sinners</HI>; but the <HI>worst of Saints</HI> are not <HI>Wicked.</HI> Indeed, There can be no Sin committed, but there is∣sues from the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> unto the Sinner. No Man can <HI>Sin,</HI> but the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD will upon it say unto him; Ezek. XVIII.4. <HI>The Soul that sinneth, it shall die.</HI> But then, the <HI>Gospel</HI> quells the <HI>Dread∣ful Sound</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> by leading us to that which <HI>speaks better Things.</HI> And tho' the Be∣liever of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> is not presently barred from all Falls into <HI>Sin,</HI> yet the <HI>Guilt</HI> of the Sin into which he falls, is taken from him; and he is rescued from that <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI>▪ which deno∣minates a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> When he falls into <HI>Sin,</HI> he falls into that which he <HI>Loves not.</HI> He may say with him; Rom. VII.15. It is <HI>what I allow not</HI>: It is <HI>what I hate.</HI> And so he is not a <HI>Wicked Man: Bone vir, hoc nibil ad Te.</HI> The <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> is not for him.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Secondly; and more Positively. A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is a <HI>Sinner,</HI> who <HI>Loves</HI> to be a <HI>Sinner.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> that is the <HI>Mark</HI> which distinguishes a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> 'Tis that <HI>Wicked Love</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> which is incon∣sistent
<PB N="5" REF="002251_0006_0FDADAAA727B8DB0"/>
with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, and with the dispositions of <HI>Piety,</HI> by which the true <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> is to be distinguished. This will be discovered in several Properties of a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI></P>
<P>First, A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one under the <HI>Reigning Power</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> We read, Rom. IV.14. <HI>Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are under Grace.</HI> If <HI>Sin</HI> have <HI>Dominion</HI> over a Man, he is not <HI>under Grace,</HI> or in good Terms with GOD; No, but he is a Subject of that <HI>Wicked Kingdom,</HI> in which every <HI>Subject</HI> is a <HI>Vassal.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> has not the <HI>steps</HI> of his Life, <HI>Or∣dered by the Word of GOD</HI>: He leads a disor∣derly Life, because <HI>Iniquity has Dominion over him.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one of those who are called, <HI>The Servants of Sin,</HI> and <HI>The Servants of Corruption,</HI> and <HI>The Captives of the Devil.</HI> It may be said of him, <HI>He serves divers Lusts.</HI> His Lusts have an absolute Command over him. The Motions of His <HI>Lusts</HI> have an irresistible Force upon him He can't Resist his <HI>Criminal Propensities.</HI> He can't mortify his <HI>Carnal Ap∣petites.</HI> His unmortified passions for <HI>Vile Things</HI> are too Potent for him. His <HI>Vices</HI> lay Chains upon him; draw him hither and hither to his Confusion. Tho' he knows it will confound him to Sin in such and such things, yet he <HI>must needs go,</HI> when he feels himself driven into it. He is entirely governed by vicious Incli∣nations.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Sin</HI> has the <HI>Full Consent</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> We read, Hos. 5.11. <HI>He wil∣lingly
<PB N="6" REF="002251_0007_0FDADADA46742538"/>
walked after the Commandment.</HI> That is to say, Commanded <HI>Idolatry.</HI> When <HI>Sin</HI> is pro∣posed, and a Man <HI>goes willingly</HI> into the propo∣sal, this <HI>Willingly</HI> is <HI>Wickedly.</HI> Indeed, there is no <HI>Sin</HI> without some degree of <HI>Consent.</HI> There goes a <HI>Consent of the Will</HI> unto ever, <HI>Act of Sin.</HI> But then there is a difference between the <HI>Consent</HI> which a <HI>Godly Man</HI> yields unto Sin, and the <HI>Consent</HI> given by a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> When a <HI>Godly Man</HI> Sins, his Fault rather lies in this, that he does not <HI>Deny,</HI> than that he does <HI>Con∣sent.</HI> As when a thing is put unto the <HI>Vote,</HI> a Man who does not <HI>oppose,</HI> but only <HI>suspend</HI> his <HI>Vote,</HI> in some sort, yields his <HI>Consent.</HI> As our <HI>Caryl</HI> expresses it;
<Q>A Child of GOD, when a Temptation comes, he does not give a direct, <HI>Yea,</HI> of <HI>Consent</HI>; but when he Sins, he does not give his, <HI>No,</HI> so livelily as he ought to do.</Q>
His <HI>Consent</HI> unto <HI>Sin</HI> is a kind of a <HI>middle Act</HI>; it lies in his <HI>not Refusing</HI> to Sin, his not Refusing, Rejecting, Repelling the of∣fer with such <HI>Vigour</HI> as he ought to do. But now, a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> Sins with a <HI>Full Consent</HI>: He is one who <HI>Chuses to Sin</HI>: Yea, He is one who <HI>prefers</HI> a <HI>way of sin.</HI> The <HI>Will</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> fully closes with Sin. He has his <HI>Will</HI> when he does a sinful Thing. If his <HI>Understanding</HI> remonstrate unto the Folly of what he is going to do, yet his <HI>Affection</HI> thoroughly espouses it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> does <HI>Resolve</HI> to <HI>Sin.</HI> We read, Eccl. VIII.11. <HI>The heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</HI> There
<PB N="7" REF="002251_0008_0FDADAABEAB62888"/>
are those who have an <HI>Heart fully set,</HI> upon sinning; such <HI>Sons of Men</HI> are the <HI>Children of Wickedness.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> if he make <HI>Prayers</HI> against Sin, yet he brings not <HI>hearty Desires</HI> against Sin. A <HI>Resolved Sinner</HI> is a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> His <HI>Resolutions</HI> are, <HI>To morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundantly.</HI> A Godly Man is one who <HI>Cleaves</HI> to GOD with a <HI>Full Pur∣pose of Heart.</HI> The <HI>main purpose</HI> of his Heart is for <HI>Godliness</HI> in all the Exercises of it. When he <HI>Sins</HI> 'tis beside his <HI>purpose</HI>; his <HI>purpose</HI> was to have done otherwise. He is out of his way when he <HI>does amiss</HI>: The well meaning Traveller has <HI>missed his way.</HI> As it has been Remarked, <HI>Peter</HI> denied the Lord, it was not because he <HI>Resolved</HI> so to do; but rather because he <HI>Resolved</HI> so much in his own strength to do otherwise. A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who <HI>Resol∣vedly</HI> sets himself in a <HI>way that is not Good.</HI> He can <HI>Sin</HI> on <HI>Deliberation,</HI> and he does it with <HI>Resolution.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, 'Tis the <HI>Delight</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> to <HI>Sin.</HI> We read, Prov. X.23. <HI>It is a sport unto a fool to do mischief.</HI> When Men can <HI>sport</HI> themselves in <HI>Sin,</HI> then mischievous is their <HI>Wickedness</HI>; 'tis <HI>mischievous Madness.</HI> To a <HI>Virtuous Man, Sin</HI> is the <HI>greatest sorrow:</HI> To a <HI>Wicked Man, Sin</HI> is the <HI>greatest pleasure.</HI> The Man who <HI>pleases</HI> GOD, is one who <HI>takes plea∣sure</HI> in doing so. He <HI>Chuses the things that please</HI> GOD. The <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who <HI>pleases himself</HI> rather than GOD, and never more than in <HI>sinning</HI> against GOD. We have been told,
<PB N="8" REF="002251_0009_0FDADADE4CC97BB8"/>
That there are such Things as, <HI>The pleasures of sin.</HI> 'Tis the guise of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> to count them so. A <HI>Wiser Man</HI> counts them Torments, Horrors, <HI>bitter</HI> Miseries. The Rule is, <HI>Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who does <HI>Delight in sinning against the Lord.</HI> There∣in he has the <HI>Desires of his Heart.</HI> It is a <HI>Grief</HI> unto a <HI>Good Man</HI> to <HI>Sin.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is <HI>glad</HI> when he <HI>Sins; Glad</HI> when GOD is <HI>griev'd.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Custom in Sin</HI> is the consummation of <HI>Wickedness</HI>; the finishing stroke in a <HI>Wick∣ed Man.</HI> He is, as I may now agreeably ex∣press it, an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> in Wickedness. We read of some, Jer. XIII.23. <HI>Who are accustomed to do evil</HI>; and can leave it off no more than the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> can <HI>Change his skin.</HI> They that are <HI>Ac∣customed to do evil</HI> are <HI>Wicked Men.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who <HI>makes a Trade of Sin.</HI> A <HI>Gracious Man</HI> may <HI>Sin</HI> and may <HI>Repeat</HI> the Sin. But then, he breaks off the <HI>Custom,</HI> with begging &amp; pleading for help against the Sin. He makes many a <HI>com∣plaint</HI> against the Sin. He never gives over <HI>com∣plaining,</HI> till he has got the <HI>Victory.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is <HI>Customarily</HI> so: He is one who is <HI>com∣monly</HI> overtaken with such Things as he knows to be <HI>Abominable Things, hated by the Soul of GOD.</HI> It is the <HI>Custom,</HI> the <HI>Course,</HI> the <HI>Way</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> to do those Things, which he knows are Forbidden by GOD, and Offensive to Him. Tho' he knows that he <HI>Trespasses</HI> in what he does, yet a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> will <HI>go on
<PB N="9" REF="002251_0010_0FDADAAE05E05948"/>
still in his Trespasses</HI>; and make a <HI>Custom</HI> of do∣ing the Things which he does <HI>not think to be Right.</HI> When these <HI>Five Brands</HI> are set upon a Sinner he may be turned loose into the <HI>Com∣mon,</HI> to graze among <HI>Wicked Men.</HI> This is a <HI>Lover of Sin,</HI> and must <HI>go in the company of wicked Men</HI>; which is also what he <HI>Loves</HI> to do: 'Tis the Note of such an one, That he <HI>Loves</HI> to do so; <HI>Loves</HI> to Flock with the <HI>Birds</HI> of his <HI>Feather,</HI> though never such <HI>unclean</HI> and <HI>hateful</HI> ones. This, This is the Man, that must have in his Ears, a <HI>Dreadful Sound.</HI> This before we go any further must be spoken to him, than which there cannot be a more <HI>Dreadful Sound; <HI>Thou art a Wicked Man;</HI> And the Portion of the Wicked belongs unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>But we are now come to our second Inquiry,</P>
<P><HI>WHAT are the Things which make a <HI>Dread∣ful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a</HI> Wicked Man?</P>
<P>In general, There is this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI>; Man, <HI>Except what thou hearest in the Tenders of the Gospel, there is nothing that makes a Joyful Sound unto thee.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one under the <HI>Curse</HI> of GOD. Now, as it was of old said, <HI>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?</HI> So it may be said, <HI>How can they be blessed, whom God hath cursed?</HI> None can speak a Comfortable thing unto the <HI>Cursed</HI> of GOD. There is this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of the <HI>Wicked.</HI> Isa. LVII.21.
<PB N="10" REF="002251_0011_0FDADAE1601E03F0"/>
<HI>There is no peace, saith my God, unto the wicked.</HI> Every Thing is a <HI>Micajah</HI> to a <HI>Wicked Man</HI>; it <HI>Prophecies</HI> nothing but <HI>Evil</HI> unto him. All the <HI>Objects</HI> which surround a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> say this unto him, I <HI>am sent with heavy Tidings unto thee.</HI> All the <HI>Creatures</HI> are up in Arms against them, who persist in Rebellion against the Glo∣rious GOD. <HI>Hear ye Rebels</HI>; were ye not very deaf, you might hear this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> from all the <HI>Creatures</HI> unto GOD crying a∣gainst you, <HI>Shall we smite them, O GOD, shall we smite them</HI>! Yea, The <HI>whole Creation</HI> is <HI>groaning</HI> against you for the Abuses you put upon it. There is a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the <HI>Groans</HI> of the <HI>whole Creation,</HI> to be <HI>delivered</HI> from your Abuses.</P>
<P>But more particularly,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Threatnings</HI> which are denounced in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD against every <HI>Wicked Man:</HI> Certainly, these must needs make a <HI>Dread∣ful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a Wicked Man. When the <HI>Commandments</HI> of GOD were given from the Flaming Mountain, there was a <HI>Dread∣ful Sound</HI> in the Ears of the People. We read, Exod. XIX.16. <HI>There were Thundrings and Lightnings, and the voice of a Trumpet ex∣ceeding loud, so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</HI> The <HI>Commandments</HI> of GOD are armed with Tremendous <HI>Threatnings</HI> against the Breaches of it. The <HI>Law</HI> has its <HI>Penalties</HI> for the Breakers of it The <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the
<PB N="11" REF="002251_0012_0FDADAB30DBE4F80"/>
Word of GOD, against the <HI>Wickedness,</HI> wherein the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD is violated, what are they but <HI>Thundrings</HI> and <HI>Lightnings</HI>; and the <HI>Voice of a Trumpet exceeding Loud,</HI> making a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a <HI>Wicked man.</HI> O most Hard hearted one, why dost thou <HI>Tremble</HI> so lit∣tle under the Fulminations? We read, Rom. I.18. <HI>The wrath of GOD is revealed from Heaven, against all Ungodliness &amp; Unrighteousness of men.</HI> 'Tis Re∣vealed &amp; Proclaimed, &amp; Published in the <HI>Threat∣nings</HI> of His <HI>Word.</HI> But, What a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> is made by these <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the Ears of all <HI>Ungodly</HI> and <HI>Unrighteous</HI> men? Hearken to the <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD makes, in the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of it. <HI>Hear attentively, the Noise of His Voice, and the Sound that goeth out of His Mouth. The Voice roareth; He Thundreth with the Voice of His Ex∣cellency. He Thundreth marvellously with His Voice</HI>; the <HI>Dreadful</HI> Things which He will do unto the <HI>Wicked: Things which we cannot com∣prehend</HI>! Is there not a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in that word of GOD! Eccl. VIII.13. <HI>It shall not be well with the wicked.</HI> Is there not a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in that word of GOD! Psal. XXXII.10. <HI>There shall be many Sorrows to the wicked.</HI> Is there not a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in that word of GOD! Prov. XIII.21. <HI>Evil pur∣sueth sinners.</HI> In the Predictions of what was to befal a <HI>wicked World,</HI> we read of a Treble <HI>Wo-Trumpet</HI>; whereon, Rev. VIII.13. <HI>An Angel fly∣ing thro' the midst of Heaven, sayes with a loud Voice, Wo, wo, wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002251_0013_0FDADAE2A54AA180"/>
Even so, The <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, make this <HI>Dreadful Sound, <HI>Wo, wo, wo to the wicked lovers of Sin.</HI></HI> Some little Rumbling of the <HI>woful Sound</HI> shall be now heard among you.</P>
<P>First, There is in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> of <HI>Temporal woes</HI> threat∣ned unto the <HI>Wicked.</HI> What a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> may the <HI>wicked</HI> hear in that word! Deut. XXVIII.59 <HI>The Lord will Make thy Plagues wonderful.</HI> There are many <HI>Woes</HI> which the word of GOD threatens unto the <HI>wicked,</HI> in the concerns of <HI>this Life</HI>; and at length an <HI>Early Death,</HI> and a <HI>Grievous Death.</HI> As the <HI>Promises▪</HI> declare <HI>Godliness</HI> to be <HI>profitable unto all things,</HI> thus the <HI>Threatnings</HI> declare <HI>Wickedness to be Detrimental unto all things.</HI> O <HI>wicked</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hear the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI>; It foretels <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Devourers</HI> to sieze upon thy <HI>Harvest</HI>; foretels GOD making thee <HI>Sick</HI> in <HI>smiting</HI> of thee; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foretels, a <HI>Reproach that shall not be wiped</HI> away It foretels, tbe Raising up of <HI>Adversaries</HI> to m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lest thee; It foretels, a <HI>Vexation</HI> with <HI>all Adver∣sity</HI>; It foretels, a <HI>Life consumed in the Anger of GOD</HI>; and Finished with a very Hastened and Unhappy Period.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> of the <HI>Trumpet</HI> is to <HI>wax Louder and Louder.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, There is in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> of <HI>Spiritual woes</HI> threat∣ned unto the <HI>wicked</HI> What a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> may the <HI>wicked</HI> hear in that word! Exod. IX.14. <HI>I will send all my plagues upon thy

Is there not a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in that word, <HI>The wicked shall be turned into Hell</HI>! Is there not a <HI>Dread∣ful Sound</HI> in that word, <HI>The Rich man dies and is buried, and in Hell he is in Torments!</HI> Do not the Threatnings of, <HI>A strange punishment reserved for the workers of Iniquity,</HI> make a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in thy Ears, O <HI>wicked man</HI>? O lovers of Sin; When you are <HI>wandring</HI> from GOD; You may hear the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> of His Threatnings, That you shall one Day be <HI>Banished</HI> from GOD. When you are all on <HI>Fire,</HI> in <HI>Thirsting</HI> after unlawful Things, You may hear the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> of His Threatnings, That a <HI>Devouring Fire</HI> and <HI>Everlasting Burn∣ings</HI> will be appointed for you.

to the Glorious Creator of it.

The <HI>Conscience</HI> may thro' the prevalence of Impieties, and Impurities, and Carnalities be laid in a <HI>Slumber.</HI> But GOD will in His time awaken the <HI>Conscience</HI> of a <HI>wicked man</HI> out of its dozing <HI>Slumber,</HI> and then it will do like the <HI>Angel,</HI> of whom we read, <HI>He cryed with a loud Voice, as when a Lion roareth.</HI> The <HI>Conscience</HI> of a <HI>wicked man</HI> speaks thus unto him, <HI>Thou hast in thy sinning thousands of times denied the GOD that is Above; and made thy self worthy of a Destruction from GOD.</HI> O <HI>Dreadful Sound!</HI> The <HI>Conscience</HI> of a <HI>wicked man</HI> speaks this un∣to him; <HI>Thou art in ill Terms with Heaven, and thou hast the wrath of GOD abiding on thee.</HI> O <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI>!

O <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI>! Surely, 'Tis a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> which is in the Ears of a <HI>wicked man,</HI> when an Officer of the Great GOD within him, tells him, That he lies under that <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD, before which the <HI>Mountains</HI> Quake, the <HI>Hills</HI> Melt, the <HI>Rock</HI> fall, and there <HI>is no standing</HI> before the Indig∣nation!

<P>O <HI>Dreadful Sound!</HI></P>
<P>Truly, The whole <HI>Portion of the Wicked</HI> in Both Worlds, is that which makes a <HI>Dread∣ful Sound,</HI> in the Exhibitions of it. The Roaring of the New <HI>Volcano</HI> among the Western Islands, or the Noise made by all the rest of the Ignivomous Mountains is nothing to the <HI>Dread∣ful Sound</HI> of GOD from Heaven declaring what shall be done unto the <HI>Wicked.</HI> The Cataracts of <HI>Niagara</HI> make not such a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI>; The <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> of the Waves that strike aganist the Mountains of <HI>Angamannia,</HI> that not only <HI>Dea∣fens</HI> but even <HI>Sickens</HI> the Approaching Mariners, &amp; frights them out of their Wits; I say unto you, It is not a thousandth part so forminable.</P>
<P>But now the Intention of all these Exhibiti∣ons and Admonitions. This is, My Friends, to Save you from the <HI>Dreadful Sound.</HI> We read, Psal. LXXXIX.15. <HI>O Blessed are the People who do know the Joyful sound</HI>! Verily▪ If you make a due use of the <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> which terrifies you, it will soon make you par∣takers of a <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which, O <HI>Blessed are the People,</HI> whom it pertains unto!</P>
<P>The Advice to you, is, Let none remain any longer among the <HI>Wicked.</HI> Souls, <HI>Depart from the Tents of the Wicked men, lest ye be consumed
<PB N="20" REF="002251_0021_0FDADAEAC908B2C8"/>

<P>A Serious and Thorough <HI>Repentance,</HI> is the Thing, whereto all the <HI>Wicked</HI> are to be Encou∣raged. But, Oh! what a <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> is there now to be in your Ears for your Encou∣ragement! <HI>Behold I bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy</HI>! There comes from Heaven unto you this <HI>Joyful Sound; <HI>Be you never so Wicked, You may turn to</HI></HI> GOD, <HI>and upon your doing so, you shall find a Pardon.</HI> O the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of that word; Isai. LV.7. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, &amp; Return unto the Lord, who will have Mercy, and unto our</HI> GOD, <HI>for He will abundantly Pardon.</HI> There comes from Heaven unto you this <HI>Joyful Sound; <HI>Be you never so Wicked, there is a Great SAVIOUR willing to Receive you, and Redeem you, if you come unto Him.</HI></HI> O the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of that word! Joh. VI.37. <HI>Him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Let this <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> melt and break your very Hearts within you. There is not one of you all that has yet fallen into the
<PB N="21" REF="002251_0022_0FDADAC0C6DB37F0"/>
<HI>Unpardonable Sin.</HI> If you had, you would not be here. There is not one of you all, whose <HI>Day of Grace</HI> is yet over with them. If it were, you would not feel such Motions in your Souls as you do. The worst of you all, may yet <HI>Re∣turn</HI> to GOD, and in doing so, He will be Re∣conciled unto you; yea, He does <HI>Beseech you to be Reconciled unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>And now, O you, whom the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> has driv'n, and this <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> has drawn, unto <HI>Repentance,</HI> and, ye Converts of <HI>Zion,</HI> who begin to Live unto GOD, Hear, Hear the <HI>Joy∣ful Sound,</HI> which you are now to be dismiss'd withal.</P>
<P>You are now to have in your Ears that <HI>Joy∣ful Sound, <HI>Be of Good cheer, Thy Sins are for∣given thee</HI>.</HI> That <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> is now for you, <HI>This is a dear Son, This is a pleasant Child, I will surely have Mercy on him.</HI> That <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> is now for you; <HI>All things shall work together for Good unto them that Love</HI> GOD. Yea, To you there belongs that <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> O <HI>Death, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory?</HI></P>
<P>And, O you that Live unto GOD, and <HI>hate every false way</HI>; After your passing thro' the <HI>valley of Death,</HI> &amp; again coming out of the <HI>Grave,</HI> you shall hear this <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> from the Mouth of the Glorious Lord; Math. XXV.34. <HI>Come, ye Blessed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! may the <HI>Sound</HI> thus heard from the Two Mountains of <HI>Ebal</HI> and of <HI>Gerizzim,</HI> have a due Impression upon you!</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002251_0023_0FDADAE99AC3AF40"/>¶ BUT that the Designs of REPENTANCE may be the more Effectually prosecuted, there must be made more Audible, a <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> which the Providence of the Glorious GOD has lately produced among us, and which requires to be most seriously attended to.</P>
<P>There is a Remarkable One, in the Condition of that <HI>Son of Death,</HI> who appears in <HI>Chains</HI> this Day among us, and who is within these Two or Three Hours to <HI>flee down to the Pit</HI>; there may be <HI>no staying</HI> of him.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> there is in the <HI>Ejulations</HI> of this poor Creature, upon the View of what he has <HI>done,</HI> and of what he is now to <HI>Suffer</HI> for it. His <HI>Weeping &amp; Howling</HI> for the <HI>Miseries</HI> that <HI>Come upon him,</HI> do make this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in our Ears; <HI>Wickedness! What will it bring to! What will it End in!</HI> Oh! Let <HI>all Israel Hear and Fear,</HI> and let none do any more so <HI>Wickedly!</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, it makes a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of this <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> to be told;
<Q><HI>Man,</HI> within a <HI>few Hours</HI> the <HI>Lamp</HI> of thy <HI>Life,</HI> is to be put out with Shameful, Painful, Tragical Circumstances. Thy <HI>Soul,</HI> thy never dying <HI>Soul,</HI> must within as <HI>Few Hours,</HI> appear before a Great and a Terrible GOD, who has been infinitely Offended by thy Wickedness, and whose <HI>Anger,</HI>—Who, <HI>Who knows the Power of it?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Ghost of his Murdered Wife; This too must needs make a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in his Ears. It crys, <HI>Vengeance, Vengeance upon the Murderer</HI>!

All the Country hears the Cry; and the <HI>Sword</HI> of GOD in the hand of His <HI>Ministers,</HI> is drawn upon it.</P>
<P>It adds doleful Murmurs to the <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> That this Wretched <HI>Ethiopian</HI> has been so distinguished from the most of his Complexi∣on; and been admitted unto such very <HI>Distin∣guishing Privileges.</HI> He was favoured with a Religious Education, which Enabled him to Read the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD, and learn the <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI> of Christianity; and then had an Eman∣cipation into a <HI>Liberty,</HI> which he has been too unthankful for. He made a Profession of Re∣ligion, and was <HI>Baptised,</HI> and stood a Candidate for <HI>Communion</HI> in the Church; which indeed the Faithful <HI>Pastors,</HI> fearing that <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> in him, which is now discovered, wisely delay'd unto him. Now, for One who so <HI>Knew the Will</HI> of our Glorious Master, to do as he has done; for One under such Obligations, to be a Pat∣tern of all Goodness unto other <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> to prove of so Doubly and so Deeply <HI>Black</HI> a Cha∣racter; Oh! how <HI>Many</HI> &amp; how severe <HI>Stripes,</HI> in the Infernal Prison must such an One be worthy of! <HI>Ungrateful Wretch</HI>! What art thou worthy of!</P>
<P><HI>Miserable Man</HI>; I hope, you take Notice of what I speak to the People of GOD concerning you. But, Oh! Be astonished at what I must after all speak unto <HI>You</HI> upon it. In the midst of all this <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> there is a <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which you are to be advised and ap∣prised of: That <HI>Joyful Sound</HI>; There is a SA∣VIOUR,
<PB N="24" REF="002251_0025_0FDADAEC777E7B60"/>
in whose <HI>Blood</HI> there is, <HI>A Fountain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness.</HI> You may come to that <HI>Open Fountain</HI>; and Plead the <HI>Blood</HI> of your SAVIOUR for your <HI>Pardon.</HI> The most <HI>Bloody</HI> Sinners may do so; They that have a <HI>Blood-Guiltiness</HI> upon them, are Allowed, yea, Commanded, so to do. Even His own <HI>Murderers</HI> did it, and found Mercy with Him! Do it; and Beg at the same time, <HI>O my SA∣VIOUR, Change my Heart; Bestow a New Heart, a Soft Heart, a Clean heart, a Good and Honest Heart upon me!</HI> Thy Soul shall become as <HI>White</HI> as the <HI>Snow</HI> and the <HI>Wooll,</HI> upon thy doing of it. We read of, <HI>Ethiopia stretching out the Hand</HI> unto GOD our SAVIOUR. O Forlorn <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> yet <HI>Stretch out those Bloody Hands</HI> of thine unto thy SA∣VIOUR; Do it, Surprized, and Conquered by that <HI>Grace</HI> of His, which now sends this call unto thee; <HI>Lay hold on me, Perishing Sinner, Lay Hold on me, and thou shalt yet come into the Peace of GOD.</HI> In so saying, I speak the <HI>Last Words,</HI> that I shall ever speak unto you.</P>
<P>But there are especially <HI>Three</HI> Brief Re∣marks, which I shall make on the <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> which our Ears are all now struck with∣al. There are indeed especially <HI>Three</HI> Sorts of Persons, that are very notably concerned in it.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Relatives,</HI> and especially the <HI>Nearest Relatives,</HI> those that are in the <HI>Conjugal Rela∣tion</HI>; Let <HI>Them</HI> hear the <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> and beware of all <HI>Ill-carriage</HI> to one another. To

Your <HI>Prayers together</HI> will <HI>hinder</HI> your <HI>Quarrels,</HI> if your <HI>Quar∣rels</HI> do not hinder your <HI>Prayers.</HI> But O <HI>Pray∣erless</HI> ones, If you go on to cast off your <HI>Prayers,</HI> little can you foresee what you may be left unto. The Man whose <HI>Dying Hour</HI> is now not many Minutes off, tells me, That he usually kept up his <HI>Daily Prayers,</HI> but he had <HI>No Pray∣ers, No Prayers</HI>! — on the Day before the Dark Night, wherein, you see what GOD left him to. <HI>Consider this ye that forget GOD.</HI>— For there are some <HI>Husbands</HI> in this Town, I

<P>Secondly. The <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> and Other <HI>Slaves</HI> among us, may hear a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Fate of their Unhappy Brother here before them; and they are to take warning from it. There is a <HI>Fondness</HI> for <HI>Freedom</HI> in many of you, who live Comfortably in a very easy Ser∣vitude; wherein you are not so <HI>Well-advised</HI> as you should be. If you were <HI>Free,</HI> many of you would not Live near so well as you do. Be your <HI>Servitude</HI> never so hard, yet <HI>Patience</HI> will be your Duty under it, while GOD shall order it for you. Be sure, the <HI>Yoke</HI> will gall the less, for your being <HI>Patient</HI> under, what GOD will have to be, <HI>The Thing Appointed for you.</HI> But when your <HI>Servitude</HI> is <HI>Gentle,</HI> and you are treated, with more than meer <HI>Humani∣ty,</HI> and fed and cloth'd and lodg'd, as well as you can wish for, and you have no <HI>Cares</HI> upon you, but only to <HI>Come when you are called,</HI> and to <HI>Do what you are Bidden</HI>; certainly you should Glorify GOD with a sweet <HI>Contentment</HI> of Mind, in the Lot which He has assigned you. Become the <HI>Servants</HI> of CHRIST, and you are made <HI>Free-men</HI> immediately. Get the <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST; Give your selves unto Him; Let not a Day pass you without <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> before Him; Don't venture to <HI>Sin</HI> against Him; or do any thing that you Know He has <HI>forbiden</HI> you: <HI>Obey</HI> faithfully them that have the Rule over you, propoun∣ding to yield <HI>Obedience</HI> unto Him in doing so;
<PB N="28" REF="002251_0029_0FDADAF24AC5C830"/>
Study to <HI>please</HI> your Superiours, because you shall <HI>please Him</HI> in doing of it. Then, tho' you are poor <HI>Slaves,</HI> yet you will be <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, and <HI>Brethren</HI> to the Best of Men; and your <HI>Slavery</HI> will very quickly, <HI>very quickly,</HI> Expire in a <HI>Glory</HI> wherein you shall <HI>walk</HI> with your SAVIOUR <HI>in White,</HI> and have a part in the <HI>Royal Priesthood.</HI> But what I would yet more particularly and pertinently and power∣fully inculcate upon you, is This; I hope the most of you live with such as are so far from <HI>Envying</HI> you the Benefits of <HI>Christian Know∣ledge,</HI> that they would be unspeakably <HI>Glad</HI> of seeing you arrive to the Greatest Improve∣ments in it; yea, <HI>Glad</HI> of Sitting down with you at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. Now, I lay the charges of GOD upon you, That the more you <HI>Know,</HI> the more you be careful to <HI>Do</HI> according to what you <HI>Know</HI>: And afford not the least shadow of any occasion, for that False com∣plaint, <HI>That the worst Servants are those that have had most Instruction bestow'd upon them.</HI> And, That if you should at length be so <HI>Lifted up to Heaven,</HI> as to be openly Received among the <HI>Disciples</HI> of our SAVIOUR, You be not <HI>Haughty,</HI> because of the <HI>Holy Mountain,</HI> which you are brought unto: No, but be the more <HI>Humble,</HI> the more <HI>Dutiful,</HI> the more <HI>Diligent,</HI> for what you have arriv'd unto. <HI>Pride goes be∣fore Destruction.</HI> See what the <HI>Pride,</HI> of your Conceited, and Vain glorious and Ostentatious Brother here, has <HI>gone before!</HI></P>

<P>In <HI>Reading</HI>!—Of what, I pray? I know that within these few Dayes, a Gentle∣man, who heard you had no <HI>Bible</HI> with you, sent a <HI>Bible</HI> to you.

at such a Time; and this after you have been a Great pretender to the <HI>Reading</HI> of them, and were always vain gloriously <HI>Quoting</HI> of Sen∣tences from them wherever you came, — It looks very Suspiciously. It confirms my Fear of a Reigning <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> under all the Noisy Profession of Religion you have made among us. I am also afraid, That you have spent your Time ill; under the Delusions of some wicked People, who did perswade you, that you would never be convicted of the <HI>Murder</HI> you are now to dy for; because, forsooth, there were no <HI>Eye-Witnesses</HI> of your doing it.
