<Q><BIBL>S. JOHN Chapt. I. Verse 12.</BIBL>
<P>But as many as received Him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name:</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN Our Blessed Saviour took upon him Human Nature, his Design was to make us partakers of the Divine Nature &amp; Happiness: He came down from Heaven, that he might advance us to the blissful Mansions of his Father's House, and de∣liver us from the Dominion of the Powers of Darkness, into the glo∣rious Liberty of the Sons of God. As this is the greatest blessing which God could give, or Man receive, Our Lord's Mission was sup∣ported with the strongest Evidence, that He did not only bear a good Will to Men, but had likewise Power to bestow upon them all that Life &amp; Immortality which his Gospel brought to light. Ne∣vertheless, His Divinity being hid under the veil of his Humanity, and the Majesty of his Person being eclipsed, by the meanness of his outward Appearance, neither the excellency of his Life &amp; Doctrine, nor the completion of Antient Prophecies, nor mighty Miracles perform'd by him, were able to perswade the obstinate Jews to look upon him as the Promis'd Messias; on the contrary, they despis'd and rejected him, and strove as much as in them lay, to make their Malice and Hatred infinite, like his Love. Such entertainment did the great Founder of our Religion meet with from an ungrateful World, for whose sake he humbled himself here upon Earth, and en∣dur'd so much Misery &amp; Affliction. Jesus Christ came to his Own
<PB N="2" REF="001544_0003_0FB3A8DFA1771F98"/>
and his Own receiv'd him not. The Conversion of the lost Sheep of the House of Israel, was his earliest and chief care; their Land was honour'd with his Sacred Birth, and to them the glad Tidings of Salvation were first Preach'd: But tho' Christ was in a Peculiar man∣ner the glory of that People, yet the beams of his Light, and the In∣fluences of his Coming, extended to the Ends of the World; after a long gloomy Night of Ignorance &amp; Error, the Sun of Righteousness rose upon all Nations, with healing under his Wings; the Partition Wall betwixt Jew &amp; Gentile was broken down, and a lively Faith qualified all People for the Divine Favour, and the participation of those benefits which Christ purchass'd for his Church. <HI>For as many as receiv'd Him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI></P>
<P>In discoursing upon which words, I'l <HI>First</HI> consider the Dignity of the Person whom we are to receive.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I'l shew, How we are to receive Him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The great advantage of doing so, for thereby we be∣come the Sons of God.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I'l represent the great Sinfulness of not receiving Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And in the <HI>Last Place,</HI> Draw some Inferences from the whole.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, with respect to the Dignity of his Person: We are assured that Jesus Christ tho' he condescended to be Born in Time, yet had a Being before Time was, and Existed from all Eternity; before he Sojourn'd in this World, He enjoy'd the Felicities of Hea∣ven, which was his proper Country, and everlasting Throne of the Prince of Peace. But as the first Adam by his Transgression rendred himself Obnoxious to the Divine Wrath, and was banish'd from a Paradise upon Earth; so the second Adam who knew no Sin, un∣derwent, for a while, a voluntary Exile from the Coelestial Paradise, that he might confer it upon us, and work a Reconciliation betwixt God and his Rebellious Subjects. <HI>I came forth from the Father,</HI> says he, <HI>and am come into the World.</HI> Again, <HI>I leave the World and go to
<PB N="3" REF="001544_0004_0FB3A8E11E54B988"/>
the Father,</HI> Joh. xvi. 17. In his Conversation with his Disciples he set them his own Example, as the most perfect Model of Humility, Meckness, Self-denial, &amp; other Vertues, which he taught in the Sub∣limest manner; His Soul was too great to be in love with Subluna∣ry Vanity, &amp; therefore he affected no Grandeur, but avoided Osten∣tation, and despis'd the air of Popular applause; as he was the Son of Man, he profess'd he <HI>came not to be Ministred unto, but to Minister, and to give his Life a ransom for many</HI>: Yet that we may not doubt his heavenly Extraction, We read, <HI>That the Angels Ministred unto him, and Worship'd him: For being in the Form of God, he thought it no robbery to be equal with God; tho he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the likeness of men.</HI> T'was the grace and favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>That tho' he was Rich he became Poor, that we through his Poverty might be Rich.</HI> For 'tis undeniably plain and clear that Himself chose that mean condition wherein he Lived, because upon occasion he could work a Miracle for the payment of the tribute Money; and all Creatures were obsequious to his pleasure; He was Heir of all things; and tho' he had not where to lay his Head upon Earth, the glorious Mansions of Heaven were disposed of by him; and since he assured his Disciples, He went thither to prepare a Place for them. The most likely way to Wean their Affections from Earthly things, was to shew them in his own Person, how lit∣tle he valu'd the Delights and Conveniences of this present Life. He likewise took our Sicknesses, and bore our Infirmities in his own Body, but at the same time gave his chosen Followers a con∣vincing demonstration of Omnipotence in his wonderful Trans∣figuration upon the Mount, where his Face did shine as the Sun, and his Raiment became white as the Light; this shew'd him able to perform what he said to the Jews, <HI>Destroy this Temple and in three Days I will raise it up</HI>; Signifying thereby his Resurrection, which declared him to be the Son of God with Power, and was a mighty Argument of his Divinity, and the
<PB N="4" REF="001544_0005_0FB3A8E32C640B50"/>
Truth of his Religion. Such was the blindness of the People of Israel, that they esteem'd him, Stricken, Smitten of God &amp; Afflict∣ed; Whereas his Death serv'd to make his Victory and Triumph the more Illustrious, when he broke the Prison of the Grave and ascended up on High, and led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men. The Angels received Him with Acclamations of Joy, and Sung; <HI>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye Lift up, ye Ever∣lasting Doors; and the King of Glory shall come in.</HI> Thus God Ex∣alted Christ far above all Principality and Power, and Might and Dominion, and every Name that is Named, not only in this World, but also that which is to come; and hath put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church. He is the living Stone, disallowed indeed of Men, but chosen of God and precious; He is that Rock from whom the waters of Life flow; He is the Bright and Morning Star which chas'd away the Clouds of the Night, and brought in an Eternal Day; He is that Light which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, that Directs them here, and Guide's them into the happy Seats of End∣less Glory hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Jesus Christ is that Great Prophet who taught the way of God Perfectly. He renewed in Man the Image of God, by those most excellent Rules and Precepts, which he gave for the Practice of true Holiness &amp; Vertue. The Gentiles had by their great Wick∣edness almost quite Eras'd those natural impressions of Good and Evil which were written in their Hearts; and the Jews by their corrupt glosses had miserably defac'd the Moral Law which was en∣graven in Tables of Stone. Our Blessed Saviour gave Strength and Beauty to them both, he Polish'd and Brighten'd the Principles of Reason, rescu'd the Law from the false interpretations of the Phari∣sees, and press'd upon the Consciences of the People the most diffi∣cult Duties of the Divine Life; for the better Observance of which, he makes a clear Revelation of Eternal Rewards and Punishments, and acquaints them that if their Righteousness did not exceed the
<PB N="5" REF="001544_0006_0FB3A8E4B2AB2548"/>
Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, they should in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but should be cast into outer dark∣ness, where there is Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth. Thus He framed the Noblest Institution and Religion that was ever vouch∣saf'd to Mankind; but this was not enough, for our first Parents and all their Posterity being deeply fallen from their Primitive Perfection, 'twas expedient there should be Satisfaction made for the Original and Actual Transgressions, which the Sons of Men are guilty of: Jesus Christ alone could make a full and sufficient Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the World; because in his Humanity he was of the same Nature with the Offenders, but without Sin; and his Divinity added an Infinite Value to his Sa∣crifice, tho' it was not capable of Suffering. And now having obtain'd an Unchangeable Priest-hood, and having over-come Death by his Death, He continues his Care and Protection to his Church, which he bought with a price inestimable. He nourishes the Souls of his Disciples with the Spiritual Food of his Word and Sacraments, pour's upon them plentiful Effusions of his holy Spirit, and Promis'd to be with them to the End of the World. And in the last and greatest act of his Regal Office, He shall come again with Glory to Judge both Quick and Dead; and shall Pronounce the Sentence of Everlasting Punishment to the Bad, and Life Eternal to the Good and Pious.</P>
<P>Thus I have consider'd the Dignity and Excellency of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which was the first thing I propos'd to Speak to. I come,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To shew how we are to Receive Him. Now to <HI>Re∣ceive</HI> Christ, is to <HI>Believe</HI> on his Name; That is, To Exercise all the acts of such a Faith as produceth the genuine fruits of Piety and Obedience. If we so acknowledge Christ as to believe in him, if we so believe in him as to Love him; if we so love him as to keep his Commandments; then we are rooted and grounded in love, and Christ dwells in our Hearts by Faith. This kind of
<PB N="6" REF="001544_0007_0FB3A8E62FA981F0"/>
Faith is that Key which opens the heavenly Treasures; that Spi∣ritual Eye which discern's the Invisible things of God; that Hand which reaches to the Tree of Life; and that Pillar of Fire which leads the true Israelites through the Wilderness of this World, into the Coelestial Canaan. For so it is Written; Joh▪ iii 16. <HI>God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoso∣ever believeth in Him should not Perish, but have Everlasting Life.</HI> The Purifying of the Heart is one great property of Faith, and is the Wedding Garment put on by those who truly believe in Jesus Christ. Otherwise, if our Hearts be Unsanctifyed and full of Sinful Thoughts, we shall give our Saviour a worse entertain∣ment than he receiv'd in the Manger, among the brute Beasts: But the Holy Spirit Purifies the Heart by Faith: as it is Written, <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 9. How acceptable to God Purity and Innocence is, there cannot be a greater instance than our Dear Lord's Concep∣tion: She who was so much in favour with God, as to bring a Saviour into the World, was indeed descended from the Royal Line of the Kings of Judah, according to Ancient Prophecies, but at this time the Stem of Jesse was brought very low, being re∣duc'd to its roots; and the blessed Virgin's Vertue was more Illustrious than her Family. And as God shew'd his great Love of Holiness in the Conception of his beloved Son, so he likewise did at his Nativity. The humble Shepherds were the Persons to whom the glad Tidings of great Joy were brought, and they heard the Angels Sing their Anthems of Praise, for the Birth of a Sa∣viour. The heavenly Host visited them whose harmless Lives bore the nearest resemblance to their own: and who in their mean Calling retain'd some Footsteps of Man's Primitive Righteousness. The Inhabitants of Courts and Cities were not dispos'd to welcome a Lawgiver, who should reform the Extortion and Injustice of the one; and the Pride and Luxury of the other: Earthly Treasures were all their care, and they gave themselves little trouble about the Heavenly; and accordingly Christ tell's
<PB N="7" REF="001544_0008_0FB3A8E7AED113B0"/>
them, It was easier for a Camel to go thro' a needles eye than for such to enter into his Kingdom. The Prince of Life will meet with no better a reception from us whilst our affections lie groveling upon the Ground, and our minds cleave to the Dust; but if we desire nothing upon Earth in comparison of him, and count all Temporal things as dross, when they come in competition with our Duty; and Purify our selves from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit; then we shall be qualified to entertain this Divine Guest in our Souls; our Bodies too will become living Temples of the Deity, and delightful Habi∣tations of his Presence. But this is not the only property of Faith; for it enlightens our Understandings as well as Sanctifies our Hearts; and this illumination of the Mind, makes us cor∣dially imbrace the Religion of the Crucified Jesus. For want of it the Jews stumbled and fell; they were an extremely carnal People, and look'd for happiness no farther than the pleasures of Sense: At the time of our Saviour's appearing amongst them, they retain'd their Polity &amp; Government, but their Necks were gall'd with the Roman Yoke, and they were Tributaries to that People; which made them impatiently long for the Messias, whom they expected to be a Temporal Deliverer, that should raise Himself a Kingdom upon the ruins of the Roman Empire, and other Worldly Powers. Jesus Christ disappointing them in their Ex∣pectations; they were very far from owning Him to be the King of Israel. And as his Humiliation here below were a stumbling block to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had some Knowledge of the true God, so was it foolishness to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> whose Minds the god of this World had wholly darken'd. There is nothing more evident to an Unprejudic'd inquirer, than that the Prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the Messias are made up of two sorts of Predictions; One foretelling his first advent to Save the World, the other his second coming to Judge the World. With respect to the former, the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> describes Him, in the liii <HI>d.</HI> Chapter, <HI>As a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, without
<PB N="8" REF="001544_0009_0FB3A8EC268F9CD0"/>
Beauty that we should desire him.</HI> With respect to the latter, <HI>Daniel</HI> uses these Magnificent expressions, in the vii. Chapter 13, 14.v. <HI>I saw in the night Visions, and behold One like the Son of Man, came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the Antient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People Nations and Languages should Serve him: His Dominion is an everlasting Do∣minion, which shall not pass away, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroy'd.</HI> So gross were the Understandings of the Jews, that the generality of them took no notice of this distinction, but refus'd the Holy One, and the Just. In like manner the Cross of Christ was foolishness to the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> because the necessity of such an excellent Persons Sufferings was a thing beyond their comprehension; being unacquainted with the true origine of Mankind, they knew nothing of that Sacrifice of A∣tonement which was to reconcile them to God. Our Saviour's Sublime Precepts and Stupendous Miracles would certainly have given Him in their esteem a preference to the greatest of their Philosophers were they satisfyed in the reasons of his Passion; they would soon have desisted from their cruel Persecutions, if they had been firmly perswaded that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him, who was numbred among the Transgressors. Such of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who consulted and believed the Scriptures made no Scruple of giving their assent to this Truth: The admirable Harmony betwixt the Old and New Testament, and the Resur∣rection of Jesus from the Dead, convinc'd them of his Divi∣nity, and took away the Scandal of his Cross. Upon this ac∣count St. <HI>Paul</HI> congratulates the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> in the following Words, <HI>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and Love unto all the Saints, cease not to give thinks for you, making mention of you in my Prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him: the eyes of your
<PB N="9" REF="001544_0010_0FB3A8ECED9DFA80"/>
Understanding being inlightn'd:</HI>— Eph. i.15, 16, 17.v. From hence it appears that Illumination of the Mind is the happy conse∣quence of a Lively Faith; and if it be joyn'd with true Holi∣ness, it will enable us worthily to Receive our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to shew,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The great advantages of doing so; for thereby we become the Sons of God. Nothing can give us so adequate an Idea of the greatness of this Priviledge, as the contemplation of the Misery of our Natural Estate. How are we born to possess a few Months of Vanity here below▪ How short is our Life! Short indeed in Time, but tedious in the Troubles that attend it! Our Reason does distinguish us from the rest of the Creation in nothing more than in the pain it gives us; the brute Creatures are sen∣sible only of the present Moment; but we double our Miseries by anticipating the future, and reflecting upon the past: The Na∣tural Evils we suffer are many and real, and the happiness we enjoy is but imaginary, or at the best, but a privation of Pain. So in Moral things, how weak and faint is the light of unassisted Reason, how uncertain to direct our steps in the way that we should walk, how unable to lead us to that Rest and Happiness which we so earnestly desire. The best Men among the Heathens allow'd them∣selves in great Vices, and the most perfect of their Governments incourag'd several Enormities, by the very Laws of their Consti∣tution; which is particularly true of the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>: Tho' a <HI>Plutarch</HI> inform's us, The <HI>Spartan</HI> Virtue out-shin'd all the rest. It is easy to account for this universal Corruption of the Gentile World, by observing how much at a loss they were to Know what should be the reward of their actions; the vulgar sort were amus'd with a Poetical Fiction of <HI>Flowry</HI> Plains, and <HI>Elysian</HI> Fields; but their most Exalted Sages confess'd it doubtful, Whe∣ther there was any such thing as a Future State, or not. So true is the character which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of them, <HI>That they were
<PB N="10" REF="001544_0011_0FB3A8EE90EF3480"/>
aliens from the common Wealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenant, having no hope, and being without God in the World: They were the Children of Wrath, and of Disobedience, being dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> indeed were in a much better condition; and Israel was honour'd with the title of God's Son, even his first born: As it is Written, <HI>Exod</HI> iv.22.v. He was their God, and they were his People. But not to insist upon the great Defects of their Law in many other points, I shall only mention at present this difference betwixt them and us. Tho' they were the Sons of God, and the Peculiar favourites of Heaven, yet they had no other express Motive to Obedience than the Promise of an Earthly Inheritance: therefore it is that the inspired Penmen so often lament the vanity of Human Life, wherein their comforts ended almost as soon as begun. That good Prince <HI>Hezekiah</HI> describes this condition of Mortality in the most moving strain. <HI>The Grave cannot Praise thee, Death can∣not Celebrate thee: They that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy truth; the Living, the Living he shall Praise thee, as I do this day</HI>: Isai. xxxviii.18, 19.v. But now the Gospel has open'd a new Scene of things, and discover'd such Mysteries as have been hid from the Foundation of the World· He that believeth in Christ tho' he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in Him shall never dye. The Adopted Sons of God under this gracious Dispensation, are Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and when they arrive at that happy Place, they shall Inherit there Immortal Glory and Eternal Joy. We must com∣plain no more of the calamities of this World, since they serve to quicken our Pace to a better; and Death it self loses its Terrors, as being but a short Passage to an Endless Life. And that we may not miss of the prize of the High Calling that is before us, God assist's us with the aids of his Holy Spirit, by whose Inspiration the Thoughts of our Hearts are cleans'd, our Lusts subdu'd, and all the hindrances of our Salvation removed:
<PB N="11" REF="001544_0012_0FB3A8F01E6AE168"/>
Such is God's Paternal Love and Care of us in and thro' Christ, That he has not given us the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry <HI>Abba Father,</HI> Rom. viii.14. Another instance of the Divine Goodness which we en∣joy in this State of Adoption, is the Plenary Remission of our Sins. The blood of Christ speaketh better things than that of <HI>Abel,</HI> and taketh away the Sins of the World. They who sin∣cerely repent and believe the Gospel, shall be Saved from Eter∣nal Death; God will be Merciful to their Unrighteousness, and their Iniquities will he remember no more. The consideration of these inexpressible benefits one would think sufficient to make us perform the conditions upon which they are Promised, <HI>Namely,</HI> To Believe in Christ, by whom alone we are Justified and Re∣concil'd to God. But lest there should be in any of you an Evil Heart of Unbelief,</P>
<P>I come in the <HI>Fourth</HI> Place, To represent the great Sinfulness of not Receiving Jesus Christ as our Saviour. If our Duty rises in proportion to the Means of Conviction, which are afforded us, then our guilt will be very great should we deny our assent to the Truth of the Gospel: for Almighty God in his Infinite Wisdom has used all possible methods to Excite our Faith, and Engage our Obedience to Jesus Christ: which will appear, if we do but consider first, The Intrinsick Excellency of the Christi∣an Religion, which evidently bears the stamp of Divinity upon it, as being agreeable to the highest reason, and advancing Hu∣man Nature to the greatest Perfection it is capable of in this World; It acquaints us with the great End of our Creation, Establishes a just empire over our Passions, and Instructs in the way of obtaining true Happiness, <HI>viz.</HI> The Beatifick Vision and Fruition of God: Nay, so compleat are the Doctrines of the Gospel, That they do not only make our Lives more Divine and Rational, but likewise free them from a great part of the Mise∣ries of this World: Were they duly observed, the Peace of God
<PB N="12" REF="001544_0013_0FB3A8F1AEDE1F88"/>
would attend us thro' all the changes and chances of this Mortal Life, and safely conduct us to the Haven of Rest and Felicity: The Wisdom from Above which is first Pure, and then▪ Peacea∣ble, would restore this present State to it's Original Innocence and Tranquillity, and make Wars and Tumults which disturb these Lower Regions to cease in the Earth. In short, The Christian Religion does so infinitely exceed all others, that if there were no other argument, this alone is a sufficient proof, that our Blessed Saviour was a Person sent from God. But alas, This is the condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil; and therefore extraordinary Miracles were used to fix their belief and attention: The <HI>Jews</HI> were extremely Sottish in ascribing them to the Devil, because as our Saviour argu'd, they tended to the Destruction of Satan's Kingdom; they were most of them acts of Charity and Mercy towards Men, and were brought in confirmation of that holy Instituti∣on which Jesus Christ Publish'd to the World; whereby the Powers of Darkness were utterly subverted, and Mankind was rescued from their Miserable Slavery, and Subjection to Evil Spi∣rits: the Finger of God therefore was plainly visible in those Mighty Works, and they were effects of a Divine Power Inhe∣rent in Jesus Christ. However, besides this evidence of Mira∣cles God has given us the sure word of Prophecy to depend upon, that there might not be the least pretence for Infidelity; how were the Time and Place of his Birth, the most impor∣tant actions of his Life, his bitter Death and Passion, and his Victory over Hell and the Grave exactly foretold many Ages before our Saviour's Incarnation; to Him bear all the Prophets Witness; Nay <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s stile is so clear and particular, that it is difficult to relate the History of past Transactions more distinctly than he has Propheci'd of things to come. How just then is that Sentence which Christ pronounces upon the Unbelieving
<PB N="13" REF="001544_0014_0FB3A8F32105CFC8"/>
World, after his appearance among them? <HI>He that believeth not, is condemned already, because he has not believed in the Name of the Only begotten Son of God.</HI> This is a very fruitful Topick, but I hope there is no need to inlarge upon it, and considering the Severity of the Season, will conclude with a brief APPLI∣CATION of what has been said.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, Let us not neglect this Great Salvation; but let us sincerely believe in Jesus Christ, and act suitably to such a belief. Our Duty is set before us in the clearest Light, and we have more Powerful Motives to Obedience than either <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles</HI> had; our Obligations therefore are greater, and more will be expected from us; and tho' we are Justified by Faith in the blood of Christ, yet we know, <HI>That without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> Thus are we to receive Jesus Christ here, if we expect to be receiv'd by Him here-after; for He solemnly declares, <HI>Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the Will of my Father which is in Heaven</HI>; And, <HI>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.</HI> S. Matth. vii.11.v. S. Joh. xv.14.v.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let us set a just value upon the glorious Privilege of being made the Sons of God. As we are Heirs of Eternity, and entituled to a Kingdom that shall not decay, let us never do any thing unworthy of such Hopes, and unbecoming such a Relation; but let us walk as Children of the Light, and of the Day: and since Jesus Christ has Sanctify'd our Nature in taking it upon Him, let us not Debase it with those Vices which were inexcusable even in the Heathens.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>Lastly,</HI> Let us be careful to render our just Tribute of Praise and Thanksgiving for the ineffable Mercy of
<PB N="14" REF="001544_0015_0FB3A8F481B5ED60"/>
God, in sending His Own Son into the World. Our Saviour is come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon us, which giveth Light to them that sit in darkness, and guideth our Feet into the way of Peace. Let us therefore extol the Name of God, and say; <HI>Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth.</HI> Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour unto Him. <HI>Blessing, Honour, Glory and Power be unto Him that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for Ever and Ever.</HI></P>
